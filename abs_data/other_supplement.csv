"O-, N-Atoms-Coordinated Mn Cofactors within a Graphene Framework as Bioinspired Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysts","Manganese (Mn) is generally regarded as not being sufficiently active for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to other transition metals such as Fe and Co. However, in biology, manganese-containing enzymes can catalyze oxygen-evolving reactions efficiently with a relative low onset potential. Here, atomically dispersed O and N atoms coordinated Mn active sites are incorporated within graphene frameworks to emulate both the structure and function of Mn cofactors in heme–copper oxidases superfamily. Unlike previous single-metal catalysts with general M-N-C structures, here, it is proved that a coordinated O atom can also play a significant role in tuning the intrinsic catalytic activities of transition metals. The biomimetic electrocatalyst exhibits superior performance for the ORR and zinc–air batteries under alkaline conditions, which is even better than that of commercial Pt/C. The excellent performance can be ascribed to the abundant atomically dispersed Mn cofactors in the graphene frameworks, confirmed by various characterization methods. Theoretical calculations reveal that the intrinsic catalytic activity of metal Mn can be significantly improved via changing local geometry of nearest coordinated O and N atoms. Especially, graphene frameworks containing the Mn-N3O1 cofactor demonstrate the fastest ORR kinetics due to the tuning of the d electronic states to a reasonable state.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.201801732
Atomically-dispersed Mn-(N-C2)2(O-C2)2 sites on carbon for efficient oxygen reduction reaction,"Owing to their ultimate mass-catalytic activity, simple active site configuration and readily tunable electronic structures, transition-metal single atoms (SAs) on carbon support have emerged as a new category of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we exemplify the use of atomically dispersed Mn with N, O heteroatoms-coordinated Mn sites to enhance alkaline ORR performance. A combined sol-gel/carbonization approach is developed to controllably anchor Mn-SAs onto graphitic carbon nanosheets via a hybridized N, O coordination configuration of Mn-(N-C2)2(O-C2)2 (denoted as Mn-SA@CNSs). The obtained Mn-SA@CNSs exhibits superior alkaline ORR electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.88 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH. The rechargeable Zn–air battery assembled using Mn-SA@CNSs air cathode can readily attain a high power density of 177 mW cm−2 with a narrow voltage gap of 0.76 V at 5 mA cm−2. Density functional theory calculations unveil that altering the coordination environment of Mn-SAs from N-coordinated Mn-(N-C2)4 to N-/O-coordinated Mn-(N-C2)2(O-C2)2 alters the d-band electronic structures and regulates the binding strength of ORR intermediates on Mn-SA sites to dramatically reduce the energy barrier and enhance ORR activity. The exemplified hybridization coordination approach in this work would be applicable to alter the electronic structures of other transition-metal SAs for ORR and other reactions.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.04.016
High-Efficiency Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide Catalyzed by Nickel Single-Atom Catalysts with Tetradentate N2O2 Coordination in a Three-Phase Flow Cell,"Carbon-supported NiII single-atom catalysts with a tetradentate Ni-N2O2 coordination formed by a Schiff base ligand-mediated pyrolysis strategy are presented. A NiII complex of the Schiff base ligand (R,R)-(−)-N,N′-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylidene)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine was adsorbed onto a carbon black support, followed by pyrolysis of the modified carbon material at 300 °C in Ar. The Ni-N2O2/C catalyst showed excellent performance for the electrocatalytic reduction of O2 to H2O2 through a two-electron transfer process in alkaline conditions, with a H2O2 selectivity of 96 %. At a current density of 70 mA cm−2, a H2O2 production rate of 5.9 mol gcat.−1 h−1 was achieved using a three-phase flow cell, with good catalyst stability maintained over 8 h of testing. The Ni-N2O2/C catalyst could electrocatalytically reduce O2 in air to H2O2 at a high current density, still affording a high H2O2 selectivity (>90 %). A precise Ni-N2O2 coordination was key to the performance.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202004841
Modulating coordination environment of Fe single atoms for high-efficiency all-pH-tolerated H2O2 electrochemical production,"Designing atomically dispersed non-precious metal catalysts for 2e− oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an appealing strategy to harness O2-to-H2O2 chemistry. Nevertheless, prevailing M–N–C single-atom catalysts (SACs) might still not satisfy the directional regulation of ORR selectivity, hence fail to uphold scalable H2O2 electrosynthesis with a high yield. Herein, we report the precise synthesis of (O,N)-coordinated Fe SAC (FeN2O2) and relating investigation of its performance in H2O2 production over a wide pH range, in comparison with the FeN4 counterpart. Density functional theory simulations reveal that the coordination chemistry engineering has a profound influence on the strength of the oxygen intermediate adsorption. The electron delocalization of M–O configuration readily lowers the d-band center of the Fe metal, which is beneficial to weakening the intermediate adsorption capability and promoting the 2e− ORR process. The thus-derived FeN2O2 exhibits impressive selectivity in a wide pH range, particularly reaching 95% in alkaline conditions. Furthermore, our designed gas-diffusion electrode enables a favorable H2O2 yield (300 mmol L–1) at a current density of 60 mA cm–2 for 50 h. This work is anticipated to inspire the rational design of definitive SAC architecture for practically feasible electrochemical production of H2O2 toward environmental remediation.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121578
High-Efficiency Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Oxygen Reduction Enabled by a Tungsten Single Atom Catalyst with Unique Terdentate N1O2 Coordination,"Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have shown great potential in the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, current studies are mainly focused on 3d transition-metal SACs, and very little attention has been paid to 5d SACs. Here, a new kind of W SAC anchored on a porous O, N-doped carbon nanosheet (W1/NO-C) is designed and prepared via a simple coordination polymer-pyrolysis method. A unique local structure of W SAC, terdentate W1N1O2 with the coordination of two O atoms and one N atom, is identified by the combination of aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. Remarkably, the as-prepared W1/NO-C catalyzes the ORR via a 2e– pathway with high onset potential, high H2O2 selectivity in the wide potential range, and excellent operation durability in 0.1 m KOH solution, superior to most of state-of-the-art H2O2 electrocatalysts ever reported. Theoretical calculations reveal that the C atoms adjacent to O in the W1N1O2-C moiety are the most active sites for the 2e– ORR to H2O2 with the optimal binding energy of the HOO* intermediate. This work opens up a new opportunity for the development of high-performance W-based catalysts for electrochemical H2O2 production.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202110224
Tailoring the Electronic Structure of an Atomically Dispersed Zinc Electrocatalyst: Coordination Environment Regulation for High Selectivity Oxygen Reduction,"Accurately regulating the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial to renewable energy storage and utilization, but challenging. A flexible alteration of ORR pathways on atomically dispersed Zn sites towards high selectivity ORR can be achieved by tailoring the coordination environment of the catalytic centers. The atomically dispersed Zn catalysts with unique O- and C-coordination structure (ZnO3C) or N-coordination structure (ZnN4) can be prepared by varying the functional groups of corresponding MOF precursors. The coordination environment of as-prepared atomically dispersed Zn catalysts was confirmed by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFs). Notably, the ZnN4 catalyst processes a 4 e− ORR pathway to generate H2O. However, controllably tailoring the coordination environment of atomically dispersed Zn sites, ZnO3C catalyst processes a 2 e− ORR pathway to generate H2O2 with a near zero overpotential and high selectivity in 0.1 M KOH. Calculations reveal that decreased electron density around Zn in ZnO3C lowers the d-band center of Zn, thus changing the intermediate adsorption and contributing to the high selectivity towards 2 e− ORR.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202110838
Underpotential-deposition synthesis and in-line electrochemical analysis of single-atom copper electrocatalysts,"Carbon supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined active sites and maximum atom utilization efficiency exhibit good activity and selectivity toward a series of electrocatalytic reactions. For the practical applications of SACs, development of facile synthetic methods and analytical techniques is highly useful. Here, single-atom copper has been successfully anchored on sulfur sites of doped graphite foam via an underpotential deposition strategy. By this strategy, the loading amount of Cu SACs can be regulated through tuning the deposition potential, the S contents of the doped graphite foam and the concentration of Cu precursor; moreover, the regulation is perfectly in line with Nernst equation combined with Langmuir adsorption model. Importantly, a stripping voltammetry method is successfully developed for the first time to in-line quantitatively analyze the resultant Cu SACs. Our Cu SACs exhibit remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a half-wave potential of 0.862 V (vs RHE) and long-term stability.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120028
Carbon Nanosheets Containing Discrete Co-Nx-By-C Active Sites for Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis and Rechargeable Zn-Air Batteries,"Structural and compositional engineering of atomic-scaled metal-N-C catalysts is important yet challenging in boosting their performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, boron (B)-doped Co-N-C active sites confined in hierarchical porous carbon sheets (denoted as Co-N,B-CSs) were obtained by a soft template self-assembly pyrolysis method. Significantly, the introduced B element gives an electron-deficient site that can activate the electron transfer around the Co-N-C sites, strengthen the interaction with oxygenated species, and thus accelerate reaction kinetics in the 4e- processed ORR and OER. As a result, the catalyst showed Pt-like ORR performance with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.83 V versus (vs) RHE, a limiting current density of about 5.66 mA cm-2, and higher durability (almost no decay after 5000 cycles) than Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, a rechargeable Zn-air battery device comprising this Co-N,B-CSs catalyst shows superior performance with an open-circuit potential of ∼1.4 V, a peak power density of ∼100.4 mW cm-2, as well as excellent durability (128 cycles for 14 h of operation). DFT calculations further demonstrated that the coupling of Co-Nx active sites with B atoms prefers to adsorb an O2 molecule in side-on mode and accelerates ORR kinetics.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.7b08721
Turning on Zn 4s Electrons in a N2-Zn-B2 Configuration to Stimulate Remarkable ORR Performance,"A zinc-based single-atom catalyst has been recently explored with distinguished stability, of which the fully occupied Zn2+ 3d10 electronic configuration is Fenton-reaction-inactive, but the catalytic activity is thus inferior. Herein, we report an approach to manipulate the s-band by constructing a B,N co-coordinated Zn-B/N-C catalyst. We confirm both experimentally and theoretically that the unique N2-Zn-B2 configuration is crucial, in which Zn+(3d104s1) can hold enough delocalized electrons to generate suitable binding strength for key reaction intermediates and promote the charge transfer between catalytic surface and ORR reactants. This exclusive effect is not found in the other transition-metal counterparts such as M-B/N-C (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu). Consequently, the as-obtained catalyst demonstrates impressive ORR activity, along with remarkable long-term stability in both alkaline and acid media. This work presents a new concept in the further design of electrocatalyst.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202009991
Atomically Dispersed Binary Co-Ni Sites in Nitrogen-Doped Hollow Carbon Nanocubes for Reversible Oxygen Reduction and Evolution,"With the inspiration of developing bifunctional electrode materials for reversible oxygen electrocatalysis, one strategy of heteroatom doping is proposed to fabricate dual metal single-atom catalysts. However, the identification and mechanism functions of polynary single-atom structures remain elusive. Atomically dispersed binary Co-Ni sites embedded in N-doped hollow carbon nanocubes (denoted as CoNi-SAs/NC) are synthesized via proposed pyrolysis of dopamine-coated metal-organic frameworks. The atomically isolated bimetallic configuration in CoNi-SAs/NC is identified by combining microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. When employing as oxygen electrocatalysts in alkaline medium, the resultant CoNi-SAs/NC hybrid manifests outstanding catalytic performance for bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution reactions, boosting the realistic rechargeable zinc–air batteries with high efficiency, low overpotential, and robust reversibility, superior to other counterparts and state-of-the-art precious-metal catalysts. Theoretical computations based on density functional theory demonstrate that the homogenously dispersed single atoms and the synergistic effect of neighboring Co-Ni dual metal center can optimize the adsorption/desorption features and decrease the overall reaction barriers, eventually promoting the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. This work not only sheds light on the controlled synthesis of atomically isolated advanced materials, but also provides deeper understanding on the structure–performance relationships of nanocatalysts with multiple active sites for various catalytic applications.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.201905622
Coordination of Atomic Co-Pt Coupling Species at Carbon Defects as Active Sites for Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"Platinum (Pt) is the state-of-the-art catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but its high cost and scarcity limit its large-scale use. However, if the usage of Pt reduces to a sufficiently low level, this critical barrier may be overcome. Atomically dispersed metal catalysts with high activity and high atom efficiency have the possibility to achieve this goal. Herein, we report a locally distributed atomic Pt-Co nitrogen-carbon-based catalyst (denoted as A-CoPt-NC) with high activity and robust durability for ORR (267 times higher than commercial Pt/C in mass activity). The A-CoPt-NC shows a high selectivity for the 4e- pathway in ORR, differing from the reported 2e- pathway characteristic of atomic Pt catalysts. Density functional theory calculations suggest that this high activity originates from the synergistic effect of atomic Pt-Co located on a defected C/N graphene surface. The mechanism is thought to arise from asymmetry in the electron distribution around the Pt/Co metal centers, as well as the metal atoms' coordination with local environments on the carbon surface. This coordination results from N8V4 vacancies (where N8 represents the number of nitrogen atoms and V4 indicates the number of vacant carbon atoms) within the carbon shell, which enhances the oxygen reduction reaction via the so-called synergistic effect.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.8b04647
Enhanced oxygen reduction with single-atomic-site iron catalysts for a zinc-air battery and hydrogen-air fuel cell,"Efficient, durable and inexpensive electrocatalysts that accelerate sluggish oxygen reduction reaction kinetics and achieve high-performance are highly desirable. Here we develop a strategy to fabricate a catalyst comprised of single iron atomic sites supported on a nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur co-doped hollow carbon polyhedron from a metal-organic framework@polymer composite. The polymer-based coating facilitates the construction of a hollow structure via the Kirkendall effect and electronic modulation of an active metal center by long-range interaction with sulfur and phosphorus. Benefiting from structure functionalities and electronic control of a single-atom iron active center, the catalyst shows a remarkable performance with enhanced kinetics and activity for oxygen reduction in both alkaline and acid media. Moreover, the catalyst shows promise for substitution of expensive platinum to drive the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction in zinc-air batteries and hydrogen-air fuel cells.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-018-07850-2
Electronic structure engineering to boost oxygen reduction activity by controlling the coordination of the central metal,"Adjusting the electronic structure of the active center is a highly effective strategy for improving the performance of catalysts. Herein, we report an atomically dispersed catalyst (FeCl1N4/CNS), which realized for the first time a great improvement of the ORR by controlling the electronic structure of the central metal with a coordinated chlorine. The half-wave potential of FeCl1N4/CNS is E1/2 = 0.921 V, which is the highest among the reported values for non-precious metal electrocatalysts and far exceeds that of FeN4/CN and commercial Pt/C in alkaline solution. Besides an exceptionally high kinetic current density (Jk) of 41.11 mA cm-2 at 0.85 V, it also has a good methanol tolerance and outstanding stability. Experiments and DFT demonstrated that the near-range interaction with chlorine and the long-range interaction with sulfur of Fe modulated the electronic structure of the active site, thus resulting in a great improvement of the ORR in alkaline media. The present findings could open new avenues for the design of superior electrocatalysts.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/c8ee01481g
Boosting Selective Nitrogen Reduction via Geometric Coordination Engineering on Single-Tungsten-Atom Catalysts,"Atomic interface regulation that can efficiently optimize the performance of single-atom catalysts (SACs) is a worthwhile research topic. The challenge lies in deeply understanding the structure–properties correlation based on control of the coordination chemistry of individual atoms. Herein, a new kind of W SACs with oxygen and nitrogen coordination (W-NO/NC) and a high metal loading over 10 wt% is facilely prepared by introducing an oxygen-bridged [WO4] tetrahedron. The local structure and coordination environment of the W SACs are confirmed by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure. The catalyst shows excellent selectivity and activity for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Density functional theory calculation reveals that unique electronic structures of the N and O dual-coordinated W sites optimize the binding energy of the NRR intermediate, resulting in facilitating the electrocatalytic NRR. This work opens an avenue toward exploring the correlation between coordination structure and properties.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202100429
Engineering Atomic Single Metal-FeN4Cl Sites with Enhanced Oxygen-Reduction Activity for High-Performance Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells,"Fe-N-C single-atomic metal site catalysts (SACs) have garnered tremendous interest in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to substitute Pt-based catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Nowadays, efforts have been devoted to modulating the electronic structure of metal single-atomic sites for enhancing the catalytic activities of Fe-N-C SACs, like doping heteroatoms to modulate the electronic structure of the Fe-Nxactive center. However, most strategies use uncontrolled long-range interactions with heteroatoms on the Fe-Nxsubstrate, and thus the effect may not precisely control near-range coordinated interactions. Herein, the chlorine (Cl) is used to adjust the Fe-Nxactive center via a near-range coordinated interaction. The synthesized FeN4Cl SAC likely contains the FeN4Cl active sites in the carbon matrix. The additional Fe-Cl coordination improves the instrinsic ORR activity compared with normal FeNxSAC, evidenced by density functional theory calculations, the measured ORR half-wave potential (E1/2, 0.818 V), and excellent membrane electrode assembly performance.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.2c06459
Ru–Co Pair Sites Catalyst Boosts the Energetics for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction,"Manipulating the coordination environment of the active center via anion modulation to reveal tailored activity and selectivity has been widely achieved, especially for carbon-based single-atom site catalysts (SACs). However, tuning ligand fields of the active center by single-site metal cation regulation and identifying the effects on the resulting electronic configuration is seldom explored. Herein, we propose a single-site Ru cation coordination strategy to engineer the electronic properties by constructing a Ru/LiCoO2 SAC with atomically dispersed Ru−Co pair sites. Benefitting from the strong electronic coupling between Ru and Co sites, the catalyst possesses an enhanced electrical conductivity and achieves near-optimal oxygen adsorption energies. Therefore, the optimized catalyst delivers superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotential, the high mass activity of 1000 A goxide−1 at a small overpotential of 335 mV, and excellent long-term stability. It also exhibits rapid kinetics with superior rate capability and outstanding durability in a zinc–air battery.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202205946
