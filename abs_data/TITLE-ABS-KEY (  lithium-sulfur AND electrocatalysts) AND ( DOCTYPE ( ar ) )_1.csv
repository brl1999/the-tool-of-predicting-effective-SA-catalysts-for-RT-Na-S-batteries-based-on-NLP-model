Unveiling the synergistic catalysis essence of trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni phosphides for lithium–sulfur chemistry,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) have emerged as prospective candidates for energy storage systems due to their high energy density and low cost of sulfur. However, the fast capacity degradation stemming from the fatal lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle and sluggish redox reaction kinetic acts as the bottleneck for the real implementation of LSBs. Herein, we propose a well-designed nanosphere functionalized with trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni phosphides (FCNP) to host sulfur and promote the sulfur redox reactions. The well-dispersed trimetallic phosphides can not only enhance polarity and electron conductivity but also supply sufficient conversion sites and short sulfur evolution pathway. Therefore, the elaborated trimetallic phosphides on carbon nanosphere effectively inhibits LiPSs escaping from the cathode to anode. Further, the systematic electrochemical measurements and synchrotron X-ray three-dimensional nano-computed tomography (X-ray 3D nano-CT) results provide clear evidence that FCNP as a bidirectional electrocatalyst smoothly accelerates the generation and decomposition of Li2S. Accordingly, the S/FCNP cathode exhibits a remarkable discharge capacity of 1172.3 mA h g−1 at 0.2C in coin cell, 1164.0 mA h g−1 at 0.1C in pouch cell and the favorable cycling performance.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.139638

Herein, N-doped FeP nanospheres decorated N doped carbon matrix is successfully synthesized by facile one-pot pyrolysis and in-situ phosphorization technique to mitigate the conversion kinetics and suppress the shuttle effect. The large specific surface area with mesopores can incorporate up to 81.5% sulfur, with the conductive carbon and nitrogen co-matrix providing Li+/e- passage and fastening the redox kinetics. The remarkable adsorption properties and the electrocatalytic activity through physical confinement and chemical immobilization is thoroughly verified. Consequently, the FeP/C[sbnd]N@S deliver a high reversible capacity of 1183 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C compared to Co/P/C[sbnd]N@S (961 mAh g−1); whereas, at 1 C, a negligible decay rate of 0.04% is observed for 1000 cycles, possessing outstanding cycling stability and rate capability. Hence, the cost-effective in-situ phosphorization strategy to synthesize FeP/C[sbnd]N@S as an efficient nanoreactor is constructive to be applied in Li-S batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2022.09.126

The Ni-NiO-C was synthesized by carbonizing Ni-PhIm, which used benzimidazole as the organic ligand. The carbon skeleton of Ni-NiO-C provides numerous active sites for adsorbing and chemical anchoring for polysulfides. Meanwhile, the uniformly dispersed Ni and NiO in Ni-NiO-C ensure the integrity of the internal redox process. In addition, the interconnected CNT networks offer good conductivity throughout the entire structure, contributing to fast electron transfer. Hence, the Ni-NiO-C@CNT@S electrode exhibits a remarkable initial specific capacity of 1468 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, and maintains 904.4 mAh g−1 even at a high discharge rate of 2 C. Moreover, Ni-NiO-C@CNT@S presents outstanding cycle stability with capacity retention of 76.20% and a decay rate of 0.05% per cycle after 500 cycles at 2 C.

Emerging catalytic materials for practical lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesHigh-energy lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have experienced relentless development over the past decade with discernible improvements in electrochemical performance. However, a scrutinization of the cell operation conditions reveals a huge gap between the demands for practical batteries and those in the literature. Low sulfur loading, a high electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio and excess anodes for lab-scale LSBs significantly offset their high-energy merit. To approach practical LSBs, high loading and lean electrolyte parameters are needed, which involve budding challenges of slow charge transfer, polysulfide precipitation and severe shuttle effects. To track these obstacles, the exploration of electrocatalysts to immobilize polysulfides and accelerate Li-S redox kinetics has been widely reported. Herein, this review aims to survey state-of-the-art catalytic materials for practical LSBs with emphasis on elucidating the correlation among catalyst design strategies, material structures and electrochemical performance. We also statistically evaluate the state-of-the-art catalyst-modified LSBs to identify the remaining discrepancy between the current advancements and the real-world requirements.

Multi-function hollow nanorod as an efficient sulfur host accelerates sulfur redox reactions for high-performance Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The “shuttle effect” of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) leads to loss of active materials and the deterioration of cycle stability, which seriously restricts the practical progress of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The diffusion of soluble discharge intermediate is the root cause of the above problems. Herein, we synthesized a porous organic framework material (HUT-8) based on triazine network, the polar groups above the hollow structure can not only adsorb LiPSs through electron donating effect, but also anchored cobalt (II) ions provide a large number of binding sites for the in-situ growth of CoS2. This ensured maximized exposure of catalytic centre and improve their interactions with sulfur redox species under the confinement of mesopores, which can catalytically accelerate capture/diffusion of LiPSs and precipitation/decomposition of Li2S. Based on the synergistic effect of the composite materials, the CoS2-HUT-8/S cathode maintained a capacity of 583 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 C, and a minimum capacity fading rate of 0.046% per cycle.

Mesoporous hierarchical NiCoSe2-NiO composite self-supported on carbon nanoarrays as synergistic electrocatalyst for flexible lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have enormous application potential in the flexible energy storage field due to their large theoretical specific capacities and high energy densities. However, lithium-sulfur batteries face a notorious shuttle effect problem. To address this challenge, this work reports a three-dimensional (3D) structure of binary transition metal selenides (B-TMSe) hierarchical composites (CC/NiCoSe2-NiO) on carbon cloth as a self-supporting sulfur host for flexible LSBs. According to the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, NiCoSe2can exert a synergetic effect of high affinity with Lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and electrocatalytic activity to lower the adsorption energy barrier and accelerate the sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfides. Consequently, the CC/NiCoSe2-NiO-based electrodes realize a large specific capacity of approximately 1363 mAh/g at a current density of 0.1C, excellent rate performance (454.66 mAh/g at 5C) and a reversible specific capacity of 978.9 mAh/g at 1C, along with impressive cycling stability with an attenuation rate of 0.038% per cycle for 1000 cycles. They also achieve a large reversible cycle capacity of 919.43 mAh/g at 0.2C even at a high sulfur loading (3.5 mg/cm2). With a lean electrolyte (E/S ratio 10 µL/mg) and a high sulfur loading of 2.65 mg/cm2, a large capacity of 934.1 mAh/g is retained after 150 cycles at 0.5C. The assembled pouch cells from S@CC/NiCoSe2-NiO electrodes show a high initial discharge capacity of 1039.5 mAh/g at 1C at a sulfur loading of 2.65 mg/cm2 and maintain strong stability under high twisting and buckling.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2022.07.106
Nickel-cobalt Cyclo-tetraphosphate decorated hollow carbon nanocages as effective polysulfide promoters for stable Lithium-Sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promising next-generation energy storage systems. The construction of high-efficiency electrocatalysts to overcome the barriers of sluggish lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion and shuttle effect is urgent. Herein, nickel–cobalt cyclo-tetraphosphate (NiCoP4O12) nanoparticles embedded in hollow carbon polyhedrons are elaborately prepared and used as excellent polysulfide promoters in LSBs. The well-controlled core–shell structure physically blocks and strongly captures LiPSs, thereby boosting LiPSs conversion kinetics over the large exposed NiCoP4O12 active sites. Meanwhile, the carbon matrix build a conductive network that enables high-speed electron and ion transport, thus forming a rapid and robust “capture-diffusion-transformation” network. As a result, the assembled S@NiCoP4O12 cathode delivers an excellent rate capacity (518.7 mAh g−1 at 5 C), impressive stability (a small capacity decay of 0.0396 % per cycle over 1500 cycles at 1 C), and favorable durability of thick sulfur cathodes under lean electrolyte condition (with 4.13 mg cm−2 sulfur loading and 5.0 µL mg−1 electrolyte) over 120 cycles.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.138677
Polar Co9S8 anchored on Pyrrole-Modified graphene with in situ growth of CNTs as multifunctional Self-Supporting medium for efficient Lithium-Sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have stimulated burgeoning interest in both the academic and industrial communities due to their ultrahigh energy density and high cost-effectiveness. However, the real-world application of LSBs has long been plagued by the shuttling effect and sluggish conversion kinetics of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSn). Herein, we have designed and synthesized creative metallic and polar Co9S8 nanoparticles with in situ growth of CNTs anchored on pyrrole-modified graphene (Co9S8/CNTs-Gr) via a facile pyrolysis method, which further demonstrates superior electrochemical performance for the fixation of sulfur and effective activation of LiPSn redox conversion. The in situ growth of CNTs and introduction of pyrrole-modified graphene are beneficial for electron migration, thus significantly boost the rate performance of LSBs. Concurrently, the Co9S8 electrocatalyst shows high catalytic activity to reinforce the polysulfide conversion. Benefiting from this exquisite nanoarchitecture design, LSBs with a S@Co9S8/CNTs-Gr cathode exhibit outstanding performance, delivering a high reversible specific capacity of 950 mA h g−1 at 1C with a decay rate of only 0.01 % per cycle. Moreover, the S@Co9S8/CNTs-Gr electrode still achieves good cycling stability with a high sulfur loading of 7.2 mg cm−2, and the specific area capacity reaches as high as ∼ 6 mA h cm−2. This work provides a delicate design to construct Co9S8-based media for high-performance LSBs and can also promote one's understanding of the advantages of the process of adsorption and redox conversion of LiPSn.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.138370
Modulating the d-p orbital coupling of manganese chalcogenides for efficient polysulfides conversion in lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The commercialization of lithium-sulfur battery (LSB) is seriously limited by the shuttling effect and sluggish reaction kinetics. Metal chalcogenides have been widely used as catalysts to enhance electrochemical performance, but the modulation essence of these non-metal anions is unclear. Herein, cubic manganese chalcogenides (MnO, MnS, MnSe) with fixed cation (Mn) and various anions (O, S, Se) are synthesized, and the anion effect on the performance of LSBs is systematically investigated. Based on the complementary experimental characterization and advanced theoretical calculations, it is clear that the interfacial redox reaction dynamics are governed by the catalytic activity of manganese chalcogenides, while the catalytic activity is modulated by the gap between the d-band of cation and p-band of anion (Δd-p). Among these manganese chalcogenides, Se has the largest atom radius and lowest electronegativity, which makes the p-band center of Se move to the Fermi level, thus increasing the electron's energy to react. Consequently, the LSBs based on MnSe catalyst exhibit the best rate (613.5 mAh g−1 at 4C) and cyclic performance (847.5 mAh g−1 after 250 cycles at 0.2C). This comparative study may encourage more effort and provide a new paradigm for developing highly effective catalysts for high-performance LSBs.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232244
A hierarchically porous TiN/N-C electrocatalyst with high interface utilization for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-Sulfur Batteries (LiSBs) are prevented to apply in practice by the irreversible loss from the cathode and difficult conversation kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). An ideal S host material should possess high conductivity and sufficiently dispersed catalytic active sites to precisely restore the dissolved LiPSs to the surface of the S host material. In traditional catalyst design, porous carbonaceous materials are often selected as carriers for the nano-catalytic activity sites. However, non-polar pure carbon interfaces, where without nano-catalytic activity sites covered, have a very weak affinity to LiPSs. Here, we use ammonia as a nitrogen source to anneal the reduced aerogel (graphene oxide (rGO) supported nano-TiO2) at high temperatures. The N element is atomically doped into the lattice of the carbon matrix, and the nano-TiO2 is converted to nano-TiN. A hierarchically porous and high conductivity TiN/N-C is prepared, in which the nano-TiN is well dispersed on the surface of N-doped rGO as an active center for catalyzing LiPSs conversion. The doped-N elements significantly increase the proportion of the polar surface. The S@TiN/N-C composite cathode delivered an excellent long-life cycling performance, and the reversible discharge specific capacity faded from 1224 ± 16 to 675 ± 31 mAh g−1 after 930 cycles. More importantly, after 150 cycles with a high S loading, a reversible areal capacity of 4.1 mAh cm−2 can be achieved.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154682

Herein, a highly-efficient Ni2P electrocatalyst supported on N, P co-doped graphene (Ni2P@NPG) is developed via a simple “recrystallization-self-assembly” method to address the above issues. The ultrafine Ni2P nanoparticles ensure abundant adsorption-diffusion-conversion interfaces for accelerating LiPSs transformation and Li2S deposition, which extremely decreases the accumulation of LiPSs in the electrolyte and therefore prevents the migration of LiPSs. Their superior catalytic performance is demonstrated by reduced Gibbs free energy changes of rate-limiting step based on the systematic theoretical calculations and the reduced shuttle effect is tested by the three-dimensional reconstructions of Raman depth profiles. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, the LSBs with Ni2P@NPG modified separators present a superior cycling performance with an average capacity decay rate of 0.048 % per cycle at 1C around the 400 cycles and a high-rate capacity of 731 mAh/g at 2C. Even with a high-sulfur loading of 3.53 mg cm−2, the cell can still contain a reversible capacity of 809 mAh/g at 0.2C with a remarkable columbic efficiency of 98.4 %.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.138310
Well-defined metal-N4 sites coordinated defective carbon as efficient electrocatalysts for high performance lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe practical application of lithium–sulfur batteries has been limited by the detrimental shuttling behavior and sluggish conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), especially under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte dosage. Although experimental and theoretical studies show that introducing defect and Fe–N4 site in carbon materials is the desirable strategy to expedite LiPSs conversion, the synergetic effect between them for sulfur redox chemistry is hardly explored. Herein, derived from a well-define Fe–N4 macrocyclic pristine iron phthalocyanine molecules (FePc) coordinated on the defective carbon nanosheets (FePc-DC), the marriage and synergetic effect between defective carbon and FePc molecules can induce remarkable Fe center electron delocalization and regulate the local electron redistribution between FePc-DC interfaces, thus brings improved LiPSs adsorption ability and conversion reaction rate. Meanwhile, the robust two-dimensional flake texture with large surface area and abundant porosity ensures robust physical confinement and fast electron/ion transfer. Attributed to such unique features, the lithium–sulfur batteries with FePc-DC cathode delivers good electrochemical performance with high areal capacity of 5.53 mAh/cm2 under high sulfur mass loading of 4.9 mg/cm2 and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6.5 μL/mg, demonstrating great potential in advanced Li–S batteries.",Materials Today Energy,10.1016/j.mtener.2022.101151

Catalysts with a solo active site can reduce a reaction barrier of a certain transition-intermediate, but the linear scaling relationship between multi-intermediates still obstructs overall SRR. Herein, we construct tandem Co–O dual sites with accelerating SRR kinetics by loading highly dispersed cobalt sulfide clusters on halloysite. This catalyst features Co with upshifted d-orbital and O with downshifted p-orbital, which cooperatively adsorb long-chain polysulfide and dissociate an S–S bond, thus achieving both optimal adsorption–desorption strength and reduced conversion energy barrier of multi-intermediates in SRR.

However, cation vacancies are few studied in the Li-S realm due to their complex and rigid preparation methods. In this work, one-step pyrolysis is reported to in situ introduce Fe-vacancies into iron sulfide (Fe0.96S) as a sulfur host. For this host structure, Fe0.96S is first employed as an adsorbent and catalyst in Li-S system. During the carbonization process, a tight contact structure of Fe0.96S crystal and carbon network (Fe0.96S@C) is in situ constructed, and the carbon layer as a conductor provides smooth electrons transfer pathways for redox reactions. Meanwhile, due to the introduction of Fe-vacancies in FeS crystal, the adsorption capability and catalytic effect for LiPSs have been substantially enhanced. Moreover, the presence of Fe0.96S crystal favors the mobility of electron and diffusion of Li+, which is revealed by the experiments and theoretical calculations. Through synergy respective advantages effect of Fe0.96S and carbon, the Fe0.96S@C-S cathode delivers high-rate capability at 5.0 C and stable long-life performance. Even under a high sulfur loading of 3.5 mg/cm2, the durable cyclic stability is still exhibited with the capacity retention of 93% over 400 cycles at 1.0 C, and the coulombic efficiency is ≥98%. Noting that this strategy greatly simplifies the synthetic process of currently known cation-vacancy materials and furnishes a universal mentality for designing both divinable and astonishing new cation-vacancy materials.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2022.08.015

Herein, high-index faceted iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanocrystals anchored on reduced graphene oxide are developed as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts, effectively improving the electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries. The theoretical and experimental results all indicate that high-index Fe2O3 crystal facets with abundant unsaturated coordinated Fe sites not only have strong adsorption capacity to anchor polysulfides but also have high catalytic activity to facilitate the redox transformation of polysulfides and reduce the decomposition energy barrier of Li2S.

Still, the adverse “shuttle effect” and sluggish sulfur conversion reaction kinetics immensely obstruct their commercial viability. Herein, a two-dimensional metallic 1T phase WS2 (1T-WS2) nanosheets modified functional separator is developed to improve the electrochemical performance.

Advanced separator containing metallic cobalt-molybdenum carbide@ 3D porous carbon for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have many good prospects for electrochemical energy storage, but they still face some important challenges, such as lithium polysulfide shuttles, which leads to irreversible loss of active materials. In this work, for the first time, metallic cobalt-molybdenum carbide wrapped within 3D porous carbon, served as a functional layer (MoCo@CHS3) on the separator of high-performance Li-S batteries. The MoCo@CHS3 obtained through the sol-gel method composite renders superior cycling performance and structural stability. Electrochemical performance confirms that the 3D porous framework with large specific surface area and pore volume can reuse the sulfur, improve conductivity, and effectively suppress the shuttling problem on account of the polysulfide capture capability. Additionally, the MoCo@CHS3 electrocatalyst provides multiple adsorption sites to capture polysulfides and promote redox reactions of polysulfides, which limit the shuttle of polysulfides. Consequently, the Li-S battery with MoCo@CHS3-PP coated separator shows an excellent capacity of 1026.7 mAh g−1 at 1 C (sulfur load, 1.9–2.2 mg cm−2), and excellent cycle stability (after 600 cycles, the capacity decay rate was only 0.066%). A high discharge specific capacity of 1022.4 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C is obtained after activation and it remains at 780.7 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles when the sulfur load is 5.0 mg cm−2.

"Efficient polysulfide conversion by Fe-N/C active sites anchored in N, P- doped carbon for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries","© 2022Lithium-Sulfur batteries have become one of the most promising energy storage systems due to their ultra-high energy density, environmental friendliness, and low cost. However, the sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LPS) and its shuttling effects have impeded the practical applications of Li-S batteries. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomically dispersed metal-based sites have been applied as a promising candidate for electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries. Herein, we design and demonstrate a single atom Fe-N/C catalyst impregnated with N, P–doped carbon (FeN6–NPC), N, P–doped carbon material (NPC), as well as Fe2P nanoparticles anchored with N, P–doped carbon (Fe2P–NPC). In-depth XANES and FT-EXAFS analyses were used to characterize the precise architecture of SACs containing Fe-N/C active sites. The electrochemical results of SACs with Fe-N/C active site configuration reveal the highest catalytic lithium polysulfide conversion compared to the NPC and nanoparticle anchored samples. In addition, the SACs enable FeN6–NPC/S electrode to deliver a high discharge capacity of 1115 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and maintain 570 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles with excellent Columbic efficiency (>99%).

Construction of frustrated Lewis pairs at N and Mo2C double sites boosts efficient electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe polysulfide shuttle effect and uncontrollable Li-dendrite growth on Li anode are the major reasons limiting the commercial development of Li-S batteries. Transition metal compounds on the carbon vector on the transition of polysulfides have been widely reported. However, there are few reports on the principle of simultaneous transformation and the effect of double active site spacing. Herein, we are based on the mechanism of the anchoring effect of doped elements on the carbon vector. Molybdenum carbide nanoparticles are mounted onto N-doped carbon nanosheets and coated on commercial separators (Mo2C-NCNS) for modification to satisfy the synchronization of S cathode and Li anode. The uniformly dispersed N element promotes the dispersion, homogenization and micro size regulation of Mo2C nanoparticles by anchoring Mo atoms. At the same time, the Mo2C site adjacent to N forms a spatially frustrated Lewis pairs with it. The reasonable spacing between them promotes the uniform deposition of lithium ions, the rapid transformation of polysulfides and the synchronous synergy between them. Characterization by XPS showed that using carbon as a bridge site further enhanced the strong metal-vector interaction between C3N4 and Mo2C, so as to improve the reaction kinetics. Thus, it has an initial specific capacity of 1186 mAh g−1 at 1C, and after 1000 cycles, 400 mAh g−1 remained, with a decay rate of only 0.06% per cycle. At a current density of 1 mA/cm2, the symmetric cell with Mo2C-NCNS modified separator exhibits steady cyclability over 1500 h, with a small overpotential of 76 mV.",Chemical Engineering Science,10.1016/j.ces.2022.117942
Modulating eg orbitals through ligand engineering to boost the electrocatalytic activity of NiSe for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesAccelerating the sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by electrocatalysis is essential to achieve high performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. However, the issue of insufficient catalytic activity remains to be addressed. Herein, a strategy of modulating eg orbitals through ligand engineering has been proposed to boost the catalytic activity of NiSe for rapid LiPSs redox conversion. The X-ray spectroscopic measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that partial substitution of Se with N disrupts the octahedral coordination of Ni atoms in NiSe, leading to the reduced degeneracy and upward shift of eg orbitals of Ni 3d states. As a consequence, the bonding strength of N-substituted NiSe (N-NiSe) with LiPSs is enhanced, which facilitates the interfacial charge transfer kinetics and accelerates the LiPSs redox kinetics. Therefore, the Li-S batteries assembled with N-NiSe present a high capacity of 682.6 mAh g−1 at a high rate of 5 C and a high areal capacity of 6.5 mAh cm−2 at a high sulfur loading of 6 mg cm−2. This work provides a promising strategy to develop efficient transition-metal based electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries through eg orbital modulation.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2022.07.025

In terms of these limitations, herein an in-situ grown WS2 nanosheets embedded on N-doped graphene (WS2@NG) composite configuration is presented with remarkably catalytic effect for S hosts.

However, the practical application is impeded by the intrinsic insulation of sulfur and the fatal shuttle effect during the (dis)charging process. Herein, we report a strategy to address the drawbacks of Li-S batteries by inserting an interwoven carbon nanotubes/cerium dioxide electrocatalyst interlayer material (CNTs@CeO2) between the sulfur cathode and the separator.

"Sacrificial Template Method to Synthesize Atomically Dispersed Mn Atoms on S, N-Codoped Carbon as a Separator Modifier for Advanced Li-S Batteries","© 2022 American Chemical Society.Efficient and durable electrocatalysts are important for polysulfide conversion in high-performance Li-S batteries. Herein, we report a sacrificial template strategy to synthesize a sulfur/nitrogen-codoped carbon-supported manganese (Mn) single-atom catalyst (Mn/SNC). The synthesis is enabled by fabricating a novel precursor, i.e., cadmium sulfide (CdS) wrapped with Mn ion-impregnated polyporrole (CdS@Mn-PPy), and subsequent pyrolysis. During pyrolysis, the CdS template is decomposed into Cd and S, PPy-derived carbon is doped with N and S, and Mn ions are reduced to Mn atoms, forming Mn-N active sites. The evaporation of Cd atoms/clusters creates abundant pores in the carbon substrate to expose the active sites and facilitate ion transport, and S atoms can form edge C-S-C bonds to improve the activity of Mn-N sites. Benefiting from the above advantages, the Mn/SNC catalyst markedly enhances the performance of Li-S batteries, delivering an initial capacity of 1563.7 mAh g-1 at 0.1C, a capacity decay of only 0.037% per cycle after 1600 cycles at 2C; a capacity of 1045.1 mAh g-1 at a high sulfur loading of 7.44 mg cm-2 at 0.2C, and a capacity retention of 73.1% after 180 cycles.

Theoretical and Experimental Understanding of Metal Single-Atom Electrocatalysts for Accelerating the Electrochemical Reaction of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Metal single-atom materials have attracted tremendous attention in the research field of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries because they can effectively improve the reaction kinetics of sulfur cathodes. However, it is still difficult to determine the best metal single-atom catalyst for Li-S batteries, due to the lack of a unified measurement and evaluation method.

Nevertheless, the shuttle effect and the sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) have long been obstacles to realizing stable LSBs with high reversible capacity. In this study, we proposed a metal-semiconductor (Mo and MoO2) heterostructure with the hollow microsphere morphology as an effective Mott-Schottky electrocatalyst to boost sulfur electrochemistry. The hollow structure can physically inhibit the shuttling of LiPSs and accommodate the volume fluctuation during cycling.

Regulating Lithium Salt to Inhibit Surface Gelation on an Electrocatalyst for High-Energy-Density Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have great potential as high-energy-density energy storage devices. Electrocatalysts are widely adopted to accelerate the cathodic sulfur redox kinetics. The interactions among the electrocatalysts, solvents, and lithium salts significantly determine the actual performance of working Li-S batteries. Herein, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), a commonly used lithium salt, is identified to aggravate surface gelation on the MoS2 electrocatalyst. In detail, the trifluoromethanesulfonyl group in LiTFSI interacts with the Lewis acidic sites on the MoS2 electrocatalyst to generate an electron-deficient center. The electron-deficient center with high Lewis acidity triggers cationic polymerization of the 1,3-dioxolane solvent and generates a surface gel layer that reduces the electrocatalytic activity. To address the above issue, Lewis basic salt lithium iodide (LiI) is introduced to block the interaction between LiTFSI and MoS2 and inhibit the surface gelation. Consequently, the Li-S batteries with the MoS2 electrocatalyst and the LiI additive realize an ultrahigh actual energy density of 416 W h kg-1 at the pouch cell level. This work affords an effective lithium salt to boost the electrocatalytic activity in practical working Li-S batteries and deepens the fundamental understanding of the interactions among electrocatalysts, solvents, and salts in energy storage systems.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.2c04176

Herein, we prepare defect-enriched VS2 nanosheets (VS2-x) as catalysts for Li-S batteries and further study the catalytic mechanism of VS2-x via ex situ X-ray diffraction and in situ UV-vis spectroscopy. A multifunctional S cathode was also obtained by assembling VS2-x on a C cloth to achieve high S loading for Li-S batteries. It was found that VS2-x catalysts undergo a lithiation process in the work voltage of Li-S batteries, and the triggered LiyVS2-x intermediates reciprocate VS2-x with a high catalytic activity so as to enhance the performance of Li-S batteries by promoting the dissociation process of S62- to S3•-.

However, their commercialization has been hindered by the ""shuttle effect"", which occurs during the charge/discharge cycles and leads to poor cycling performance and low coulombic efficiency. Here, we synthesized flower-shaped hollow VOOH spheres on the carbon nanotube (CNT) network, which were used as the multifunctional sulfur host materials for the first time in LSBs. These VOOH spheres can chemically and physically confine polysulfides as well as catalyze their redox conversion; additionally, their hollow structure can effectively accommodate the volume change during cycling.

Recently, single-atom concept unlocks a route to maximize the use of surface-active atoms, however, further increasing the density of active site is still strictly limited by the inherent structure that single-atoms are only highly-dispersed on substrate. Herein, we provide a viewpoint that an elaborate facet design with single-crystalline structure engineering can harvest high-density surface active sites, which can significantly boost the electrocatalyst performance for excellent Li-S batteries. Specifically, the single-crystal CoSe2 (scCS) exhibits three-types of terminated (011) facet, efficiently obtaining the surface with a high-rich Co3+—Se bond termination, in contrast with lots of surface grain boundaries and dangling bonds in polycrystalline CoSe2. Surprisingly, the surface active sites concentration can reach more than 69%. As anticipated, it can provide high-density and high-efficient active sites, enormously suppressing the shuttle effect and improving the reaction kinetics via accelerating the conversion and deposition of polysulfides and Li2S. This surface lattice strategy with element terminated mode is a promising approach for designing electrocatalyst effect-based energy system, not merely for Li-S batteries.

However, the notorious issue of higher-order lithium-polysulfides dissolution causes inferior cycling and poor electrochemical performance. To overcome the challenge, here, biodegradable and environmentally friendly carbonized bacterial cellulose (CBC) is used as the sulfur host. Further, Mn2O3 is incorporated in bacterial cellulose using hydrothermal synthesis and investigated as a sulfur host. The composite is prepared by a facile encapsulation “melt-diffusion” strategy. The high electronic conductivity of the CBC provides an efficient pathway to carry out redox reactions, and Mn2O3 helps to restrain and convert higher-order lithium-polysulfides to lower-order lithium-polysulfides. Further, the first-principle density functional theory calculation is performed to investigate and understand the role of carbon (CBC) and Mn2O3 in the host material.

Herein, we develop a dual-conductive 1T-VS2−MXene heterostructured electrocatalyst as a high-efficiency sulfur host, which combines the merits of ultrafast anchoring and catalysis (1T-VS2) with good nucleation and surface diffusion (MXene) for accelerating the bidirectional sulfur redox kinetics, regulating the Li2S nucleation and decomposition, and depressing the polysulfide shuttling. And combining a design of dense sulfur cathode, the highly dense S/1T-VS2−MXene monolith cathode (density: 1.91 g cm−3, conductivity: 76.3 S m−1) achieves a high volumetric capacity of 1571 Ah L−1 (based on the total volume of sulfur cathode) (gravimetric capacity: ∼1430 mAh g−1 based on sulfur) in a routine electrolyte at 0.1 C and a large areal capacity of ∼7.9 mAh cm−2 in an extremely lean electrolyte of 3 μL mgs−1 at 0.05 C. Experimental and theoretical results also clearly reveal the origin of superior performance and the synergistic mechanism of heterostructured catalyst from the perspective of the electronic structure and atomic level. Therefore, this deep work demonstrates the feasibility for the fabrication of LSBs with high volumetric and areal capacities in lean electrolytes by combining the dual-conductive heterostructure electrocatalyst with the dense-structured sulfur cathode.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.04.004
V2O3/VN Catalysts Decorated Free-Standing Multifunctional Interlayer for High-Performance Li-S Battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The shuttle effect caused by soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) hinders the practical application of lithium–sulfur batteries. The sluggish reaction kinetics of LiPSs results in rapid capacity decay. In this work, we constructed a free-standing multifunctional interlayer decorated with V2O3/VN catalysts to suppress the shuttle effect and boost the redox reaction kinetics. The introduction of VN with strong chemical adsorption improves the conductivity of V2O3, which is beneficial for the kinetics of conversion reaction. In addition, the micro/mesopores inside the structure not only facilitate ion diffusion but also buffer the volume change of the sulfur cathode during the cycling process. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the fabricated cells exhibit a high specific capacity of 1419.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1C. The cell with V2O3/VN/C exhibits a promising cycling performance over 1000 cycles with a decay rate of 0.037% per cycle at 1C.

A bidirectional electrocatalyst for enhancing Li2S nucleation and decomposition kinetics in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Accelerating sulfur redox reactions and suppressing the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) are crucial for high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we develop a highly efficient bidirectional electrocatalyst (Ti3C2/(NiCo)0.85Se) consisting of 2D Ti3C2 nanosheets loaded with well-dispersed (NiCo)0.85Se nanoparticles. Based on electrochemical analysis and theoretical calculations, the Ti3C2/(NiCo)0.85Se heterostructure is demonstrated to provide abundant active sites for steady bidirectional electrocatalysis and abundant lithiophilic-sulfiphilic anchoring points for the immobilization of LiPSs. Ti3C2 promotes the reduction process of LiPSs to Li2S, and (NiCo)0.85Se enhances the decomposition of Li2S. Moreover, the (NiCo)0.85Se nanoparticles prevent the Ti3C2 nanosheets from aggregating, ensuring a hierarchical porous framework endowed with good structural robustness and fast electron/ion transportation. Li-S batteries with Ti3C2/(NiCo)0.85Se modified separators exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan with a capacity decay rate of only 0.03% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 1C and improved rate capability. When equipped with a high sulfur loading of 6.4 mg cm−2 and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 8 μL mg−1, the cell maintains a distinguished area capacity of 9.7 mA h cm−2. This work provides a general strategy for the design of bidirectional electrocatalysts for high-performance Li-S batteries with especially remarkable cycling stability.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta05046c
"Atomically dispersed Co anchored on N,S-riched carbon as efficient electrocatalysts for advanced Li-S batteries","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery possess the advantage of high specific energy but suffer from unstable cyclic performance due to the sluggish liquid-solid conversion kinetics causing severe lithium polysulfides (LiPS) shuttling. Designing multifunctional electrocatalysts with improved activity and abundant active sites to regulate the dynamics for sulfur electrochemistry is still a significant challenge. Herein, we proposed a thiourea assisted pyrolysis combined with hard template method to synthesize cobalt single atoms co-coordinated by N and S atoms embedded hollow carbon spheres (Co-NS-HCS) as a novel sulfur host. The Co-NS-HCS mainly consists of well-dispersed Co-N3S-C center sites where Co is co-bonded by N and S atoms. Systematical characterizations revealed that the Co-NS-HCS exhibit improved SRR electrocatalytic properties with higher exchange current density and larger electron transfer number than that of Co-N-HCS. When equipped in sulfur cathodes, the S@Co-NS-HCS exhibits superior rate performance (925 mAh g−1 at 2 C), long cycle stability (69.1% of capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C). Moreover, the assembled Li-S pouch type cell also exhibits competitive cyclic performance that work stably for 100 cycles at 0.1 C with a high capacity retention of 84.7%. This work furnishes a feasible scheme for the rational design of single atoms catalysts with improved electrocatalytic activity for sulfur cathodes based on the coordination environment regulation strategy.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164799
Active Sulfur-Host Material VS4with Surface Defect Engineering: Intercalation-Conversion Hybrid Cathode Boosting Electrochemical Performance of Li-S Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Transition-metal sulfides as late-model electrocatalysts usually remain inactive in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries in spite of their advantages to accelerate the rapid conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, a series of cobalt-doped vanadium tetrasulfide/reduced graphene oxide (x%Co-VS4/rGO) composites with an ultrathin layered structure as an active sulfur-host material are prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The well-designed two-dimensional ultrathin 3%Co-VS4/rGO with heteroatom architecture defects (defect of Co-doping and defect of S-vacancies) can significantly improve the adsorption ability on LiPSs, the electrocatalytic activity in the Li2S potentiostatic deposition, and the active sulfur reduction/oxidation conversion reactions and greatly boost the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries. On the one hand, the ultrathin 3%Co-VS4/rGO possesses good conductivity inheriting from rGO which contributes to the capacity of internal redox reactions on lithiation from VS4. On the other hand, the hybrid architectures provide strong adsorption and excellent electrocatalytic ability on LiPSs, which benefit from the surface defects caused by heteroatom doping. The S@3%Co-VS4/rGO cathode displays a high specific capacity of 1332.6 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C and a low-capacity decay of only 0.05% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 3 C with a primary capacity of 633.1 mA h g-1. Furthermore, when the sulfur loading (single-side coating) reaches 4.48 mg cm-2, it still can deliver 756.2 mA h g-1 after the 100th cycle at 0.2 C with 89.5% capacity retention. In addition, the in situ X-ray diffraction test reveals that the sulfur conversion mechanism is the processes of α-S8 → Li2S → β-S8 (first cycle) and then β-S8 ↔ Li2S during the subsequent cycles. The designing strategy with heteroatom doping and self-intercalation capacity adopted in this work would provide novel inspiration for fabricating advanced sulfur-host materials to achieve excellent electrochemical capability in Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c06067

The cross-linking CNT network can serve as conductive matrix and accommodate volume change upon cycling simultaneously. Meanwhile, the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles are capable of effectively anchoring LiPSs to suppress the shuttle effect and accelerating LiPSs conversion to boost redox kinetics. Moreover, the free-standing paper electrode without any binder is conducive to constructing stable cathode with high sulfur loading.

However, there are still some thorny issues needed to be tackled before realizing their practical applications, including underperformed rate capability and unsatisfactory cycling stability. Herein, we have constructed the checkerboard-like heterostructured CoS2/Co nanoparticle inside porous carbon by the electrochemically-sulfonated reaction of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and used them as sulfur electrocatalyst. Benefiting from this structure advantage, the catalyst can not only promote the chemical adsorption of LiPS, but also acts as promoter to provide coupled electrons to accelerate its redox reaction. Through synergistic enhancement, the checkerboard-like CoS2/Co heterostructure provides a boosted chemical adsorption and accelerated catalytic conversion of LiPS, rendering suppressed shuttle effect and enhanced Li-S kinetics. In addition, the porous carbon carriers offer abundant nanoscale pores to effectively immobilize sulfur and accommodate its volume expansion. Therefore, the CoS2/Co sulfur composites exhibit decent rate capability up to 5C and long-term cycling performance over 500 cycles at 1C with a capacity fading rate below 0.059% per cycle. Moreover, an admirable cyclic stability can also be achieved under raised sulfur loading of 7.13 mg∙cm−2 and low E/S ratio of 4.5 mL∙g−1.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135990

First-principles calculations show that the (111) surface of CoSe2 possesses adjacent nucleophilic and electrophilic centers. This bi-polar surface can easily bond the polysulfide molecules and catalyze their conversion reactions. As a result, the decomposition energy barriers of polysulfides are greatly decreased from ∼3.0 eV to 0.2–0.4 eV. Following theoretical prediction, CoSe2 nanocrystals with specific (111) surface are prepared and embedded in porous carbon nanocages using ZIF-67 metal organic framework as a template. Benefited from the advantages of porous C and CoSe2 (111) surface, the shuttling of polysulfides is suppressed and their conversion kinetics is facilitated.

Herein, 2D amorphous Mo-doped cobalt boride (Co7Mo3B) is designed for the first time as bidirectional sulfur catalysis by rapid chemical reduction. The atom cluster structure of Co7Mo3B is revealed by theoretical calculation. Electron paramagnetic resonance test further confirms that Co7Mo3B has interstitial compound structure characteristics. Experimental results show that the porous 2D nanosheets structure and the interaction of Mo, B, Co atoms contribute to enhanced conductivity, high long-chain lithium polysulfides affinity, and reversible Li2S nucleation and dissociation, thus accelerating LiPSs reduction and Li2S oxidation kinetics. In addition, the interstitial Co7Mo3B enables intercalation of Li and B during charging–discharging while keeping the structure stable. As a result, the S cathode with Co7Mo3B catalyst delivers good life (1000 cycles at 5 C), superior rate performance (10 C). Even at high sulfur areal loading of 6.79 mg cm–2 and electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5 μL mg–1, the Co7Mo3B/S composite cathode still exhibits good areal capacity and capacity retention rate.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202202766

Design of versatile strategies is still desperately needed for facilitating the kinetic process of LiPSs conversion. Herein, we report an intuitive method, strain regulation, for improving the electrocatalytic performances of MXene for LiPSs conversion. The imported strain triggers the distortion of TiC3O3 octahedron configuration and the downshift of the d-band center, which facilitates the charge transfer and conversion of LiPSs on MXene. Under the guidance of the simulations, the strain-induced wrinkle flower-shaped MXene is adopted to verify the effect of strains on the conversion efficiency of sulfur. The experiments prove that the conversion rate of LiPSs and the long cycle stability of batteries were enhanced by the strained MXene. Our first-principle simulations and experiments demonstrate that the introduction of strain is viable and capable of providing a new paradigm for developing high-performance Li-S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135679

Herein, a novel 2D/2D heterostructure, consisting of ultrathin Ni-Co MOFs with rich unsaturated metal sites and conductive Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (Ti3C2Tx/Ni-Co MOF), is developed as a multifunctional barrier coated on commercial separators for Li-S batteries. Based on the synergistic adsorption-electrocatalysis, the modified separators not only suppress the dissolution of polysulfides and promote their conversion effectively, but also accelerate the electron/ion transfer. Moreover, density functional theory results further confirm that the heterostructure has strong adsorption energy for polysulfides and low energy barriers for their conversion.

However, affected by the shuttle effect and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), the application of the Li-S batteries is seriously hampered. Herein, novel thorn-like carbon nanofibers combined with molybdenum nitride nanosheets (denoted as MoN@CNFs) were well designed as a modified separator coating for Li-S batteries to restrain the shuttle effect and strengthen the redox kinetics of LiPSs. The conductive carbon nanofibers provided fast electronic transport, and the decorated MoN nanosheets possessed strong affinity to sulfur species, which could effectively anchor LiPSs, boost their redox reaction as an electrocatalyst,accelerate the reversible soluble/insoluble phase conversion process, and greatly increase the efficiency of active substance utilization.

However, how to effectively prevent the shuttling effect and accelerate the redox reaction kinetics of polysulfides are still a challenge. Herein, a strategy of using the soft template as a pore-forming agent was proposed to prepare Mo2C/nitrogen-doped carbon hollow microflowers (marked as H–Mo2C/NC MFs), which was used as an efficient absorbent and electrocatalyst of polysulfides for Li–S batteries. Due to the physical limitations of assembling the special nanosheet into a hollow carbon matrix in the shape of a microflower, the H–Mo2C/NC MFs can be used as an appropriate S loading substrate. With the synergistic chemisorption from pyridine N sites and high content polar Mo2C nanoparticles, the as-prepared H–Mo2C/NC MFs can provide enhancing adsorption and catalytic conversion for polysulfides. As a result, the H–Mo2C/NC/S MFs-based cathode provides a high initial discharge capacity of 1104.8mAh/g at 0.2C. Even at the high rate of 1.0C, the initial capacity of 705.2mAh/g still shows good electrochemical performance, and in 1000 cycles, the average capacity decay rate is only 0.016%, with supercycle stability.

Here, a hollow CoS2 nanosphere as a novel electrocatalyst for the cathode host material of high-performance Li–S batteries was obtained by a two-step strategy of solvothermal and sulfuration. Different from the traditional light carbon materials, the tap density of CoS2@S composite material has reached 1.17 g cm−3. The high tap density of CoS2@S nanospheres composite guarantees the high volume energy density. Specifically, a hollow nanosphere has a large internal space which provides the possibility for a large load of the active material (80.66 wt%). Besides, electrochemical kinetics evaluation indicated CoS2 nanospheres are beneficial for promoting Li–S electrochemical heterogeneous conversion and accelerating the diffusion of lithium ions in the cathode, both of which can help to keep the battery cycle stable and long life. Moreover, the chemical interaction between Co ions and polysulfides can effectively anchor the adsorbed polysulfides, which can help immobilize sulfur species and restrain the shuttle effect. Such a rationally prepared CoS2 nanosphere is significant for promoting the electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathode due to high-volume energy density and rapid kinetic transformation promoting action. As a result, the CoS2@S composite exhibits high volume energy density and excellent performance under high sulfur load (4.8 mg cm−2) and low E/S ratio (electrolyte/sulfur = 10 μL mg−1) based on of the composite as cathode host materials.

A Liquid-Metal Electrocatalyst as a Self-Healing Anchor to Suppress Polysulfide Shuttling in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium-sulfur battery (LSB) is a promising next generation energy storage technology due to its high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environmental friendliness surpassing current lithium-ion batteries. However, several challenges restrict the practical applications of LSBs. A major obstacle that limits its performance is the dissolution of long-chain lithium polysulfides into the electrolyte which results in loss of active material and capacity fade during the charge/discharge cycles. Here, we developed a novel sulfur composite with liquid-metal (LM) nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) dispensed on a carbon-cloth electrode to achieve long cycling of LSBs. The liquid nature of the LM nanoparticles results in many advantages. It provides a strong anchoring with sulfur inhibiting the polysulfide shuttle effect. In addition, it prevents the detachment of the sulfur particles from the current collector albeit large volume changes and cracking of the sulfur during lithiation and delithiation, maintaining the electron conduction paths. This innovative composite resulted in a high discharge capacity, an outstanding capacity retention, and a high Coulombic efficiency. Our results demonstrate an effective method to suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect and pave a new path towards practical applications of LSBs by using multifunctional LM nanoparticles composites.",Batteries and Supercaps,10.1002/batt.202100395

However, practical applications of LSBs are still largely hindered by the complicated sulfur redox reactions and the fatal polysulfide shuttling. In nature, cytochrome c reductase works as an efficient biocatalyst for oxidative phosphorylation benefiting from the synergistic electron transfer between porphyrins and sulfur clusters. Inspired by this, herein, two porphyrin-based metal-organic frameworks (Hf-H2DPBP and Hf-CoDPBP) supported by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were demonstrated to be efficient electrocatalysts for accelerating polysulfide redox kinetics when as separator coatings for LSBs.

Phosphorus doped hierarchical porous carbon nanosheet array as an electrocatalyst to enhance polysulfides anchoring and conversion,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The sluggish redox kinetics and severe lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shutting effect in lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs) greatly hinder their practical applications. In this work, phosphorus doped carbon nanosheet array (MPC) separator coating layer was synthesized by MgO template, and used as metal-free electrocatalyst to concurrently fulfill efficient polysulfide interception and conversion. By regulating the addition of phytic acid, copolymerization rate of formaldehyde, resorcinol and phytic acid can be conveniently adjusted to form a hierarchical porous MPC microstructure. Phosphorus doping introduces surface defects and enhances the polarity of MPC, which exhibits a metal-like LiPSs anchoring effect by forming Li-P and S-P bonds, avoiding the undesirable oxidation of LiPSs during adsorption. Symmetrical cell and Li2S precipitation experiments reveal that phosphorus doping reduces energy barrier for LiPSs reactions and facilitates Li2S precipitation behavior, exhibiting a strong electrocatalytic effect on Li-S chemistry. Stemming from the above advantages of MPC coated separator, cells exhibit a low interfacial reaction resistance and good anode stability. A capacity of 1161 mAh g−1 at 0.2C and a low attenuation of 0.056% per cycle at 1C over 800 cycles are achieved.

"Three dimensional self-supporting Co, N, S co-doped porous carbon derived from paulownia wood for Li-O2 batteries 锂-氧气电池用泡桐木衍生三维自支撑Co、N、S共掺杂多孔炭","© 2022, Editorial Board of CIESC Journal. All right reserved.Lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries are considered as the most promising new generation energy storage devices because of their high theoretical energy density and environmental friendliness. However, large overpotential, low practical energy density and poor cycle life are the huge obstacles to their practical application. Since the insoluble and insulating discharge products (Li2O2) gradually form on the surface or in the pores of cathode during the discharging process, these products will block the diffusion channel of O2/electrolyte and cover the catalytic active sites. In addition, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) require noble-metal-based materials as catalyst to reduce the overpotential and achieve high electrochemcial efficiency. However, high cost and scarcity of the noble-metal catalysts hinder their large scale applications. Development of economically viable and highly efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts is extremely urgent, especially for heteroatom-doped carbons as the most promising candidates. In this paper, a novel Co, N and S co-doped three-dimensional self-standing porous carbon (wd-NSC) was prepared as cathode for Li-O2 battery using melamine and thiourea as nitrogen and sulfur sources via one-step pyrolysis of paulownia wood in NaCl/CoCl2 mixed molten salt medium. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results found that the wd-NSC inherited the original vertical channel structure of paulownia wood, and formed porous carbon fiber network on the surface and inside the channels of wd-NSC. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that N and S were successfully doped into the C skeleton, while Co might exist in the form of single atom or clusters. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms showed that the wd-NSC possess hierarchical porous structure with pore sizes ranging from micropore to macropore. Raman spectra certified that the introduction of S increased the defect degree of wd-NSC. At a current density of 0.05mA/cm2, the discharge specific capacity of wd-NSC reached to 12.83mA·h/cm2, and exhibited a good rate capability and cycling stability (at a current density of 0.1mA/cm2 and a limited capacity of 0.5mA·h/cm2, the cell can maintain 125 cycles).

Li2S4 Anchoring Governs the Catalytic Sulfur Reduction on Defective SmMn2O5 in Lithium–Sulfur Battery,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The introduction of sulfur redox electrocatalysts has been considered to be an effective strategy to anchor polysulfides on the cathode and reduce the energy barriers of the reactions. Due to the complexity of sulfur redox reactions (SRR/SER), there exist few descriptors to correlate the catalytic performance and the underlying electronic structures of a given catalyst, which inhibits the development of lithium−sulfur catalysts. In this article, upon mullite oxide SmMn2O5 with various substitutional defects, density functional theory calculations are used to probe the structure–property relationships. It is found that there exists no scaling relationship among the polysulfide binding energies, indicating that the catalytic performance can be tuned by a key intermediate individually. Statistical analysis of various models with different S-containing intermediates shows that only the Li2S4 binding energy has a linear correlation with the overpotential, showing the dominant role of Li2S4 anchoring to determine the catalytic performance. The electronic structure analysis combined with machine learning further quantitatively verifies the coeffect of charge transfer, electronegativity, and work function on the binding strength of the polysulfide Li2S4. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the complex SRR/SER mechanisms and sheds light on the rational design of a sulfur redox catalyst.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202200340
Role of the Metal Atom in a Carbon-Based Single-Atom Electrocatalyst for Li-S Redox Reactions,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Carbon-based single metal atom catalysts (SACs) are being extensively investigated to improve the kinetics of the Li–S redox reaction, which is greatly important for batteries with cell-level energy densities >500 W h kg-1. However, there are contradictory reports regarding the electrocatalytic activities of the different metal atoms and the role of the metal atom in Li-S chemistry still remains unclear. This is due to the complex relationship between the catalytic behavior and the structure of carbon-based SACs. Here, the catalytic behavior and active-site geometry, oxidation state, and the electronic structure of different metal centers (Fe/Co/Ni) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene, and having similar physicochemical characteristics, are studied. Combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and electrochemical analysis, it is revealed that the coordination-geometry and oxidation state of the metal atoms are modified when interacting with sulfur species. This interaction is strongly dependent on the hybridization of metal 3d and S p-orbitals. A moderate hybridization with the Fermi level crossing the metal 3d band is more favorable for Li-S redox reactions. This study thus provides a fundamental understanding of how metal atoms in SACs impact Li-S redox behavior and offers new guidelines to develop highly active catalytic materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.",Small,10.1002/smll.202200395
A novel modified sulfur cathode to facilitate the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides in lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Physical confinement through particular nanostructures is inadequate to avoid the shuttle effect in the lithium–sulfur batteries. Electrocatalysts are based on chemisorption to fix polysulfides on the sulfur cathode and catalyze the conversion of polysulfides. Herein, a novel electrocatalyst consisting of iridium and rGO as support was prepared and employed as the additive to the sulfur cathode. Due to selective catalytic property and changes in activation energy, the formation of polysulfides is slightly inhibited and the transformation of polysulfides is accelerated. Finally, the accumulation of polysulfides and shuttle effect are alleviated. Due to the strong interaction between the polysulfide and catalyst, capacity retention and rate performance were greatly improved.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry,10.1007/s10008-022-05124-y
Ultrathin nanosheets of FeOOH with oxygen vacancies as efficient polysulfide electrocatalyst for advanced lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022Developing high effectively affinitive to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion, permanent electrochemical stability, and cost-effective electrocatalyst for sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) in a high‐sulfur‐loading and lean-electrolyte condition is highly desired for the application of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an amorphous FeOOH (A-FeOOH) with nanosheet architecture is obtained by a mild oxidation transformation process at room temperature, which is constructed as a practical catalyst to facilitate the conversion of LiPSs. A systematic structure analysises and calculation simulations reveal that the enhanced surface electron transfer dynamics of the as-formed A-FeOOH is modulated by a loss of oxygen coordination, and retention ligand oxygens are also found to be activated as co-catalysts to boost SRR process. Unsaturated Fe-O bondings tuning of catalysts via shifting of d band centers, leading to an elevated interaction between Fe 3d orbitals and S 2p orbitals, which much more effectively accelerate the breaking of S-S bonds in LiPSs. Meanwhile, enhanced electrical conductivity originated from oxygen vacancies accelerates electron repopulation, thereby promoting the smooth conversion reaction of sulfur. Additionally, A-FeOOH acts as non-carbon-based catalysts, which alleviates short circuits while reducing non-catalytic domains. The amorphous nanosheets are also uniformly and spontaneously coating on the surface of cathodes, inhibiting the shuttle effect and buffering volumetric expansion. A-FeOOH based Li-S cathode (A-FeOOH@SCM) exhibits a reversible capacity of 723 mAh.g−1 over 250 cycles at 1C and delivers a high energy density of 363 wh.kg−1 at 0.2C on multilayer-pouch cell level under lean electrolyte of 3.2 g.g−1Sulfur and high loading of 9.36 mg.cm−2.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.02.008

However, the practical application of Li–S batteries are seriously impeded by the sluggish conversion reaction from Li2S2 to Li2S. The solution of this problem relies on comprehensive understanding of Li2S2 conversion mechanisms. Herein, a theoretical model is established by generalizing the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) approach. More specifically, Li2S2 conversion is redefined in elementary steps that includes the participation of each electron. Associative and dissociative reaction mechanisms with electrocatalysts are proposed and inspected by the free energy criterion. Single atom catalysts containing Fe, Co, Ni, and V are discussed separately. The effects of applied electrode potential are accurately described by the generalized CHE approach. It is predicted that associative reaction mechanism can provide the highest electrode potential with the existence of Fe single atom catalysts. Analysis on electronic structures further confirms the electrocatalysis activity originates from the chemical bonds between S and transition metal atoms. This work unveils the Li2S2 conversion mechanisms in elementary steps. More importantly, the generalized CHE approach opens a new frontier of exploration on redox reactions in Li–S battery and hopefully other energy storage systems.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.02.002

All rights reserved.Effective fabrication of electrocatalysts active in anchoring and converting lithium polysulfides is critical for the manufacturing of high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). In this study, original Fe3O4nanospheres with diameters close to 12 nm were finely dispersed over a porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrix by the freeze-drying method to produce a three-dimensional composite material (nano-Fe3O4/PNC) suitable for application as a sulfur host in LSBs. Nano-Fe3O4/PNC loaded with sulfur (S@nano-Fe3O4/PNC) was used as a cathode in a Li-S cell, whose initial discharge specific capacity reached 1256 mA h g-1at a 0.1 C rate. After 100 charge-discharge cycles at a 0.2 C rate, the reversible capacity of S@nano-Fe3O4/PNC remained at 745 mA h g-1, demonstrating a capacity retention rate of 70%. Importantly, a high Coulombic efficiency of more than 99% was achieved, indicating effective inhibition of the polysulfides' ""shuttle effect"" by nano-Fe3O4/PNC.

Results and DTF simulation confirmed that the strong electrochemical interaction of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) with TNTAs supported by a carbon-coated separator (CCS), suppressed the shuttling effect significantly. The presence of TNTA resulted in stable cycling and superior rate performance by offering a specific discharge capacity of 1050 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 C with a low capacity-decay rate of 0.075% per cycle. The cathode with the loading of 6.8 mg S cm−2 delivered a discharge capacity of 729 mA h g−1, corresponding to 4.95 mA cm−2 after 100 cycles at the rate of 0.2 C.

Herein we design a cross-linked framework of reduced graphene oxide anchored with Cu2-x Se nanoparticles (Cu2-x Se@rGO) by building an electrolyte/Cu2-x Se/graphene triple-phase interface to be a high-efficiency electrocatalyst for Li-S batteries. Importantly, this three-dimensional conductive network possesses a large specific surface area with high ion transport capability, meanwhile providing strong physical constraint for efficient adsorption of soluble polysulfides. Further, this triple-phase catalytic interface provides strong chemical adsorption and abundant Cu2-x Se nanoparticle sulfiphilic active sites, effectively inhibiting the dissolution of polysulfides and guaranteeing the efficient polysulfide adsorption catalysis as well as rapidly uniform Li2S nucleation. Consequently, with the Cu2-x Se@rGO separator, a lower capacity decay rate about 0.059% per cycle after 500 cycles at 2 C is obtained. What's more, with a higher areal sulfur loading of 3.0 mg cm-2, the capacity is still maintained at 805 mAh g-1 over 100 cycles.

Manipulating Electrocatalytic Polysulfide Redox Kinetics by 1D Core–Shell Like Composite for Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Although lithium–sulfur batteries have high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg−1, the sluggish redox kinetics of soluble liquid polysulfide intermediates during discharge and charge is one of the main reasons for their limited battery performance. Designing highly efficient electrocatalysts with a core–shell like structure for accelerating polysulfide conversion is vital for the development of Li–S batteries. Herein, core–shell MoSe2@C nanorods are proposed to manipulate electrocatalytic polysulfide redox kinetics, thereby improving the Li–S battery performance. The 1D MoSe2@C is synthesized via a facile hydrothermal and subsequent selenization reaction. The electrocatalysis of MoSe2 is confirmed by the analysis of symmetric batteries, Tafel curves, changes of activation energy, and lithium-ion diffusion. Density functional theory calculations also prove the low Gibbs free energy of the reaction pathway and the lithium-ion diffusion barrier. Therefore, the Li–S batteries using MoSe2 electrocatalyst exhibit an excellent rate performance of 560 mAh g−1 at 1 C with a high sulfur loading of 3.4 mg cm−2 and an areal capacity of 4.7 mAh cm−2 at a high sulfur loading of 4.7 mg cm−2 under lean electrolyte conditions.

Mn-based mullite (SmMn2O5) is used as a model catalyst for the sulfur redox reaction to show how the design rules involving lattice matching and 3d-orbital selection improve catalyst performance. Theoretical simulation shows that the positions of Mn and O active sites on the (001) surface are a good match with those of Li and S atoms in polysulfides, resulting in their tight anchoring to each other. Fundamentally, dz2 and dx2−y2 around the Fermi level are found to be crucial for strongly coupling with the p-orbitals of the polysulfides and thus decreasing the redox overpotential. Following the theoretical calculation, SmMn2O5 catalyst is synthesized and used as an interlayer in a Li–S battery. The resulted battery has a high cycling stability over 1500 cycles at 0.5 C and more promisingly a high areal capacity of 7.5 mAh cm−2 is achieved with a sulfur loading of ≈5.6 mg cm−2 under the condition of a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) value ≈4.6 µL mg−1.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202110279
A Mott–Schottky Heterogeneous Layer for Li–S Batteries: Enabling Both High Stability and Commercial-Sulfur Utilization,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) are severely impeded by their poor cycling stability and low sulfur utilization due to the inevitable polysulfide shuttle effect and sluggish reaction kinetics. This work reports a Mott–Schottky RGO-PANI/MoS2 (RPM) heterogeneous layer modified separator for commercial-sulfur-based LSBs through the vertical growth of molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) arrays on the polyaniline (PANI) in situ reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Due to the synergistic effects of the “reservoir” constructed by MoS2 and RGO-PANI, strong absorbability, high conductivity, and electrocatalytic activity, RPM exhibits a successive “trapping–interception–conversion” behavior toward lithium polysulfides. As a result, the LSBs assembled using a commercial-sulfur as the cathode and RPM as modified layer exhibit high sulfur utilization (3.8 times higher than that of the unmodified separator at 5 C), excellent rate performance (553 mAh g−1 at 10 C), and outstanding high-rate cycle stability (524 mAh g−1 after 700 cycles at 5 C). Moreover, even at a high sulfur loading of 5.4 mg cm−2, a favorable areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm−2 is still maintained after 80 cycles. Theoretical calculations elucidate that such a systematic strategy can effectively suppress the shuttling effect and boost the catalytic conversion of intercepted polysulfides.

Coordinatively Deficient Single-atom Fe-N-C Electrocatalyst with Optimized Electronic Structure for High-performance Lithium-sulfur Batteries,"© 2021The rationally-designed single-atom catalyst that promotes efficient sulfur electrochemistry is highly desired yet still challenging for the development of high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, the deficient coordination of single-atom Fe site is firstly and theoretically predicted to endorse higher sulfur affinity and catalytic activity, due to the stronger hybridization between Fe 3dzz and S 3py orbitals compared with that in common FeN4 scenario.

An integrated approach to improve the performance of lean–electrolyte lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesWhile the sulfur conversion reaction kinetics in Li–S batteries is nowadays improved by the use of appropriate electrocatalysts, it remains a challenge for the batteries to perform well under the lean electrolyte condition where polysulfide shuttle, electrode passivation and the loss of electrolyte due to side reactions, are aggravated. These challenges are addressed in this study by the tandem use of a polysulfide conversion catalyst and a redox–targeting mediator in a gel sulfur cathode. Specifically, the gel cathode reduces the polysulfide mobility and hence the polysulfide shuttle and the passivation of the lithium anode by the crossover polysulfides. The redox mediator restrains the deposition of inactive sulfur species in the cathode thereby enabling the Fe–N and Co–N co–doped carbon catalyst to prolong its catalytic activity. Consequently, the integrated catalytic system is able to increase the discharge capacity of high–loading (6.8 mg cm−2) lean–electrolyte (4.0 µL mg−1) Li–S batteries from ∼630 to ∼1316 mAh g−1, concurrently with an improvement of the cycle life (600 cycles with 46% capacity retention at 1.0 mA cm−2). Redox mediator assisted catalysis in a gel cathode is therefore an effective strategy to extend the application of the sulfur conversion catalyst in lean electrolyte Li–S batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.11.004

All rights reserved.Cathodic polysulfide electrocatalysts are introduced to confidently accelerate the polysulfide conversion to propel the increased practical density of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Defect engineering as an advanced functional strategy has been confirmed to have the competent capability of optimizing the electrocatalytic kinetics. In this work, the conventional phosphorization process is used to process Co3O4anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes. Unexpectedly, there is no phase change, only phosphorus doping with rich lattice dislocation on Co3O4. With the combined characterization of X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it is found that phosphorus doping transfers part of the oxygen vacancies to the lattice oxygen of Co3O4, which can induce the catalytic active species Co-O-P. The concomitant lattice dislocations can strengthen the chemical adsorption of phosphorus-doped Co3O4for polysulfides and even elevate more catalytically active sites.

Even though, the shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) seriously restrict practical applications of Li-S batteries. Herein, a three-dimensionally ordered macro/mesoporous TiN (3DOM TiN) nanostructure is established via using poly (methyl methacrylate) PMMA spheres as template. The interconnected macro/mesoporous channels are constructed to effectively alleviate the stacking of composite materials and render a large portion of inherent active sites exposed on the surface region. Moreover, TiN exhibits high electrical conductivity, which efficiently enhances charge-transfer kinetics and guarantees the favorable electrochemical performance of sulfur cathode. More importantly, the as-prepared 3DOM TiN suppresses the shuttle effect and improves the redox kinetics significantly due to strong affinity toward LiPSs. Attributed to these unique features, the S/3DOM TiN electrode achieves an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 1187 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, and stable cycling performance of 552 mAh g-1 over 500 cycles at 1 C.

TiS2-graphene heterostructures enabling polysulfide anchoring and fast electrocatalyst for lithium-sulfur batteries: A first-principles calculation,"© 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur batteries have attracted attention because of their high energy density. However, the ""shuttle effect"" caused by the dissolving of polysulfide in the electrolyte has greatly hindered the widespread commercial use of lithiumsulfur batteries. In this paper, a novel two-dimensional TiS2/graphene heterostructure is theoretically designed as the anchoring material for lithium-sulfur batteries to suppress the shuttle effect. This heterostructure formed by the stacking of graphene and TiS2monolayer is the van der Waals type, which retains the intrinsic metallic electronic structure of graphene and TiS2monolayer. Graphene improves the electronic conductivity of the sulfur cathode, and the transferred electrons from graphene enhance the polarity of the TiS2monolayer. Simulations of the polysulfide adsorption show that the TiS2/graphene heterostructure can maintain good metallic properties and the appropriate adsorption energies of 0.98- 3.72 eV, which can effectively anchor polysulfides. Charge transfer analysis suggests that further enhancement of polarity is beneficial to reduce the high proportion of van der Waals (vdW) force in the adsorption energy, thereby further enhancing the anchoring ability. Low Li2S decomposition barrier and Li-ion migration barrier imply that the heterostructure has the ability to catalyze fast electrochemical kinetic processes. Therefore, TiS2/graphene heterostructure could be an important candidate for ideal anchoring materials of lithium-sulfur batteries.",Chinese Physics B,10.1088/1674-1056/ac3227

However, research on phosphorus vacancies has been rarely reported, and how phosphorus vacancies affect battery performance remains unclear. Herein, CoP with phosphorus vacancies (CoP-Vp) is fabricated to study the enhancement mechanism of phosphorus vacancies in Li–S chemistry. The derived CoP-Vp features a low Co-P coordination number and the introduced phosphorus vacancies mainly exist in the form of clusters. The obtained CoP-Vp can reinforce the affinity to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and thus the shuttle effect can be restrained. In addition, the reduced reaction energy barriers and the promoted diffusion of Li+ can accelerate redox kinetics. Electrochemical tests and in situ Raman results confirm the advantages of phosphorus vacancies. The S/CNT-CoP-Vp electrode presents outstanding cycling performance and achieves a high capacity of 8.03 mAh cm−2 under lean electrolyte condition (E/S = 5 μLE mg−1S). This work provides a new insight into improving the performance of Li–S batteries through defect engineering.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202102739

"Adsorption, diffusion and electrocatalytic triple effect from ultrathin-walled TiO2(B) nanotubes for lithium–sulfur batteries","© 2021 Taiwan Institute of Chemical EngineersBackground: The shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) between anode and cathode in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) has been seriously restricted their actual electrochemical performances. Coating modifications on the surface of separators is considered an effective strategy to improve the battery performances. Metal oxides, especially TiO2 as separator modifications can restrain the shuttle effect of LiPSs to a certain extent. It could be the inappropriate microstructure or limited crystal structure of TiO2, resulting in the non-ideal cycling performances of LSBs. Compared with other TiO2 phase, nanotube structured TiO2-Bronze (TiO2(B)) owns characteristic required for ideal separator modifications. However, there are relatively few studies about ultrathin-walled TiO2(B) nanotubes as separator modifications. Methods: In this paper, ultrathin-walled TiO2(B) nanotubes (TiO2(B)-NTs) were constructed through a facile hydrothermal synthesis combined with high-temperature calcination method. Significant findings: The DFT calculations and electrochemical tests of LSBs proved that the ultrathin-walled TiO2(B)-NTs as separator modifications have several advantages: strong chemical entrapment for LiPSs; fast lithium-ion diffusivity and strong catalytic activity. Consequently, compared with nanorod structured TiO2(B) and CNTs, the TiO2(B)-NTs as separator modifications deliver superior cycling performances with ∼805 mAh g−1 at 1.0 C after 80 cycles and ∼235 mAh g−1 at 5.0 C after 600 cycles, and good rate capabilities in LSBs.",Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers,10.1016/j.jtice.2021.104164
Phosphorus doping of 3D structural MoS2 to promote catalytic activity for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.To address the issues of “shuttle effect” of soluble polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics in the cathodes of lithium-sulfur batteries, the acceleration of the polysulfides conversion via electrocatalysis is a promising solution. As a common electrocatalyst, the catalytic ability of two dimensional (2D) MoS2 is considerably diminished due to agglomeration of nanosheets and insufficient active sites. In this work, a phosphorus-doped three dimensional (3D) network of MoS2-based interlayer sandwiched between the S cathode and the separator is developed. The 3D network could prevent 2D nanosheets from stacking and provide fast diffusion channels for Li ions transfer. Phosphorus doped MoS2 forms stronger Mo-S and Li-P bonds to anchor polysulfides and to promote cleavage of S-S or Li-S bonds of lithium polysulfides to accelerate the polysulfides conversion. As a result, the cell exhibits a high specific capacity of 884.4 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1C even under the high sulfur loading condition (3.7 mg cm−2). This work may encourage more efforts on heteroatom doping in electrocatalyst to realize a high performance in lithium–sulfur batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.133923

Valence modulating/engineering of the metal active centers is an underlying tactic to expedite the sluggish kinetics of LiPSs for high performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we craft Zn2+-modulated bimetallic carbides electrocatalyst of Co3ZnC-embedded carbon submicrospheres anchoring on 3D macro-mesoporous N-doped carbon (denoted as Co3ZnC@NC) via a facile one-pot synthesis that employs dicyandiamide as the carbon/nitrogen precursor. Results demonstrate that the balance of the predominantly active Co2+/Co0 pair can be effectively modulated by the incorporated zinc cations, which leads to inhibited shuttle effect and accelerates the catalytic conversion kinetics of LiPS intermediates. When acted as the interlayer to modify commercial separator, Co3ZnC@NC confers the superb cycling stability on corresponding Li-S batteries with high discharge capacities and exceptionally high-rate performance, owing to the well-defined surface structure and the increased Co2+ active sites of Co3ZnC@NC.

WN0.67-Embedded N-doped Graphene-Nanosheet Interlayer as efficient polysulfide catalyst and absorbant for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery has attracted wide research attention due to its high energy density, high earth-abundance and low-cost. However, the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and corresponding shuttle will lead to serious capacity degradation and worse cycling stability of Li-S batteries. To address such issues, herein, we firstly present a novel interlayer of WN0.67-embedded N-doped graphene-nanosheets (WN0.67@NG) via a facile solvothermal reaction followed by nitriding treatment. The Li-S cell equipped with WN0.67@NG modified polypropylene (PP) separator exhibits outstanding electrochemical performances: a long-term stability with only a capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle over 200 cycles and a large capacity of 725 mAh g−1 at 4C; interestingly, a favorable capacity of 776 mAh g−1 can be maintained after 100 cycles at 0.2C for assembled Li-S pouch cell under a high sulfur loading conditions of 4.3 mg cm−2 with lean electrolyte occupation (6 μL mg−1). The outstanding performance can be attributed to the following advantages of WN0.67@NG interlayer: the high conductivity of NG sheets can facilitate the electron transfer and act as a physical block for restricting the LiPSs shuttle; most importantly, the polar WN0.67 nanoneedles embedded on the NG sheets not only provide abundant active sites for chemisorption and catalytic conversion of LiPSs, but also contribute to the nucleation and growth of Li2S; further theoretical calculations and in-situ Raman spectra clearly reveal the adsorption and catalytic conversion mechanism of WN0.67@NG interlayer at the molecular level.

Despite their strengths, LSBs suffer from the cross-over of soluble polysulfide redox species to the anode, entailing fast capacity fading and inferior cycling stability.

In this work, double transition metal oxide TiNb2O7 (TNO) nanometer particles are tactfully deposited on the surface of an activated carbon cloth (ACC), activating the surface through a hydrothermal reaction and high-temperature calcination and finally forming the flexible self-supporting architecture as an effective catalyst for sulfur conversion reaction. It has been found that ACC@TNO possesses many catalytic activity sites, which can inhibit the shuttle effect of LiPSs and increase the Coulombic efficiency by boosting the redox reaction kinetics of LiPS transformation reaction. As a consequence, the ACC@TNO/S cathode exhibits an impressive electrochemical performance, including a high initial discharge capacity of 885 mAh g-1 at a high rate of 1 C, a high discharge specific capacity of 825 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles with a prominent capacity retention rate of 93%, and a small decay rate of 0.034% per cycle. Although TNO is extensively used in the fields of lithium ion batteries and other rechargeable batteries, it is first introduced as sulfur host materials to boost the redox reaction kinetics of the LiPS transformation reaction and increase the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. Therefore, studies of the synergistic effect on the chemical absorption and catalytic conversion effect of TNO for LiPSs of Li-S batteries provide a good strategy for boosting further the comprehensive electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c21373
Artificially Layered CoSe2 Nanosheets by a Dual-Templating Strategy for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Owing to the attractive merits of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (LTMDs) with van der Waals interactions, it is significant to modulate electronic structures and endow them with fascinating physiochemical properties by converting a nonlayered metal dichalcogenide into an atomic layered one. Herein, a dual-templating strategy is designed to prepare artificially layered CoSe2 nanosheets on carbon fiber cloth (L-CoSe2/CFC). It is found that not only the nanosheet morphology but also the layered structure is well inherited from the precursor of layered Co(OH)2 nanosheets through a wet-solution ion-exchange approach. The as-prepared L-CoSe2/CFC serves as an efficient multifunctional interlayer to solve the challenges of ""shuttling effect""and slow multistep reaction kinetics in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs), thus dramatically improving their electrochemical performance. Benefiting from the L-CoSe2 nanosheets with large interlayer spacing, strong chemical adsorption, and superior catalytic activity, L-CoSe2/CFC promotes the anchoring of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and their catalytic conversion. Consequently, the L-CoSe2/CFC cell yields a large reversible capacity of 1584 mAh g-1 at 0.2C and a high rate capability of 987 mAh g-1 at 4C. A high areal capacity of 4.38 mAh cm-2 after 100 cycles at 0.2C is achieved for the high-S-loading LSB (4.6 mg cm-2) using the L-CoSe2/CFC interlayer.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c14293
"Unraveling the Atomic-Level Manipulation Mechanism of Li2S Redox Kinetics via Electron-Donor Doping for Designing High-Volumetric-Energy-Density, Lean-Electrolyte Lithium–Sulfur Batteries","© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Designing dense thick sulfur cathodes to gain high-volumetric/areal-capacity lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) in lean electrolytes is extremely desired. Nevertheless, the severe Li2S clogging and unclear mechanism seriously hinder its development. Herein, an integrated strategy is developed to manipulate Li2S redox kinetics of CoP/MXene catalyst via electron-donor Cu doping. Meanwhile a dense S/Cu0.1Co0.9P/MXene cathode (density = 1.95 g cm−3) is constructed, which presents a large volumetric capacity of 1664 Ah L−1 (routine electrolyte) and a high areal capacity of ≈8.3 mAh cm−2 (lean electrolyte of 5.0 µL mgs−1) at 0.1 C. Systematical thermodynamics, kinetics, and theoretical simulation confirm that electron-donor Cu doping induces the charge accumulation of Co atoms to form more chemical bonding with polysulfides, whereas weakens CoS bonding energy and generates abundant lattice vacancies and active sites to facilitate the diffusion and catalysis of polysulfides/Li2S on electrocatalyst surface, thereby decreasing the diffusion energy barrier and activation energy of Li2S nucleation and dissolution, boosting Li2S redox kinetics, and inhibiting shuttling in the dense thick sulfur cathode. This work deeply understands the atomic-level manipulation mechanism of Li2S redox kinetics and provides dependable principles for designing high-volumetric-energy-density, lean-electrolyte LSBs through integrating bidirectional electro-catalysts with manipulated Li2S redox and dense-sulfur engineering.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.202204192

Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.The viability of lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries toward real implementation directly correlates with unlocking lithium polysulfide (LiPS) evolution reactions. Along this line, designing promotors with the function of synchronously relieving LiPS shuttle and promoting sulfur conversion is critical. Herein, the nitrogen evolution on hierarchical and atomistic Ni–N–C electrocatalyst, mainly pertaining to the essential subtraction, reservation and coordination of nitrogen atoms, is manipulated to attain favorable Li–S pouch cell performances. Such rational evolution behavior realizes the “nitrogen balance” in simultaneously regulating the Ni–N coordination environment, Ni single atom loading, abundant vacancy defects, active nitrogen and electron conductivity, and maximizing the electrocatalytic activity elevation of Ni–N–C system.

Nevertheless, the polysulfide shuttle effects trigger fast capacity decay and short battery lifespan, severely hampering their practical utilizations. Herein, an efficient electrocatalyst comprising of nitrogen (N)-coordinated binary metal single atoms (SAs) implanted within a hierarchical porous carbon skeleton (Fe/Co-N-HPC) is constructed to trap and catalyze polysulfides conversion through a separator coating strategy. It is demonstrated that the introduction of Co atom can enrich the electron number of Fe active center, thereby realizing the distinct synergistic catalytic effect of binary metal SAs and improving the bidirectional catalysis of Li–S redox reaction. As a result, Li–S batteries with the Fe/Co-N-HPC-modified separator exhibit outstanding rate capability (740 mAh g−1 at 5.0 C), and superior long-term cyclic stability (694 mAh g−1 after 600 cycles at 1.0 C). Increasing the sulfur loading to 4.8 mg cm−2, a remarkable areal capacity of 6.13 mAh cm−2 is achieved. Furthermore, in situ X-ray diffraction and theoretical simulation results verify the catalysis mechanism of binary metal SAs by changing the rate-determining steps, providing new directions for constructing high-performance Li–S batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202208666

Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Sophisticated efficient electrocatalysts are essential to rectifying the shuttle effect and realizing the high performance of flexible lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Phase transformation of MoSe2 from the 2H phase to the 1T phase has been proven to be a significant method to improve the catalytic activity. However, precisely controllable phase engineering of MoSe2 has rarely been reported. Herein, by in situ Li ions intercalation in MoSe2, a precisely controllable phase evolution from 2H-MoSe2 to 1T-MoSe2 was realized. More importantly, the definite functional relationship between cut-off voltage and phase structure was first identified for phase engineering through in situ observation and modulation methods. The sulfur host (CNFs/1T-MoSe2) presents high charge density, strong polysulfides adsorption, and catalytic kinetics.

A bifunctional VS2-Ti3C2 heterostructure electrocatalyst for boosting polysulfide redox in high performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The commercial development of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) is extremely hindered due to the shortcomings of sluggish reaction kinetics and the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling effect. For overcoming these limitations, a bifunctional VS2-Ti3C2 heterostructure electrocatalyst is designed as a sulfur host material in LSBs, combining suitable adsorption capacity, enhanced catalytic activity, and layer-by-layer interstitial channels to achieve a balanced and efficient “capture-diffusion-catalysis” process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the intrinsically conductive VS2-Ti3C2 possesses an elevated d-band center, improving interaction with LiPSs and accelerating interfacial electron transfer. In addition, the layer interstitial spaces of the 3D lamellar interspersed network facilitate lithium ion diffusion. As a result, LSBs assembled with VS2-Ti3C2/S exhibit a high reversible discharge capacity (1237 mA h g−1 at 0.2C), excellent rate performance (559 mA h g−1 at 10C), and robust cycle stability (0.024% decay rate after 500 cycles at 1C). Moreover, even at a high sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm−2, a favorable capacity of 852 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 90.5% is still maintained after 150 cycles. This work provides inspiring insights into heterostructure materials with a high rate and sulfur loading in mediating conversions and migrations of matter toward LSBs with promising performance.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta05604f
3D Cellulose Graphene Aerogel with Self-Redox CeO2 as Li2S Host for High-Performance Li–S Battery,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium sulfide is considered the promising cathode material of a Li–S battery because of its high theoretical capacity, high melting point, affordable volume expansion, and lithium composition. However, the quick capacity fading and high activation energy barrier due to low electronic and ionic conductivity and polysulfide shuttle effect still restrict the practical application of the Li2S cathode. Herein, CeO2 is introduced with unique self-redox characteristics into cellulose graphene aerogel (CGA) with the 3D interconnected structure (CGA/CeO2) as the host of Li2S. It is found that CGA/CeO2 can provide plentiful three-phase boundary for the chemisorption to LiPSs through the strong polarity of CeO2. Moreover, the ultrastrong polarity of CeO2 can restrain the LiPSs shuttle, and CeO2 can spontaneously oxidize polysulfide, thus boosting the conversion reaction kinetics and comprehensive electrochemical performances of Li–S battery based on Li2S cathode. As a result, these features reciprocate Li2S-CGA/CeO2 cathode excellent electrochemical performances. Therefore, this work not only provides a significant exploration for the mechanical explanation of the cerium oxide catalytic conversion reaction but also provides a brand-new idea for the excellent electric catalyst for the catalytic conversion reaction of polysulfide in lithium–sulfide batteries.",Energy Technology,10.1002/ente.202200616

Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.In this work, unique Co3O4/N-doped reduced graphene oxide (Co3O4/N-rGO) composites as favorable sulfur immobilizers and promoters for lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are developed. The prepared Co3O4 nanopolyhedrons (Co3O4-NP) and Co3O4 nanocubes mainly expose (112) and (001) surfaces, respectively, with different atomic configurations of Co2+/Co3+ sites. Experiments and theoretical calculations confirm that the octahedral coordination Co3+ (Co3+Oh) sites with different oxidation states from tetrahedral coordination Co2+ sites optimize the adsorption and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides. Specially, the Co3O4-NP crystals loaded on N-rGO expose (112) planes with ample Co3+Oh active sites, exhibiting stronger adsorbability and superior catalytic activity for polysulfides, thus inhibiting the shuttle effect. Therefore, the S@Co3O4-NP/N-rGO cathodes deliver excellent electrochemical properties, for example, stable cyclability at 1 C with a low capacity decay rate of 0.058% over 500 cycles, superb rate capability up to 3 C, and high areal capacity of 4.1 mAh cm−2.

Dynamic Liquid Metal Catalysts for Boosted Lithium Polysulfides Redox Reaction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Designing efficient electrocatalysts with high electroconductivity, strong chemisorption, and superior catalytical efficiency to realize rapid kinetics of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion process is crucial for practical lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery applications. Unfortunately, most current electrocatalysts cannot maintain long-term stability due to the possible failure of catalytic sites. Herein, a novel dynamic electrocatalytic strategy with the liquid metal (i.e., gallium–tin, EGaSn) to facilitate LiPSs redox reaction is reported. The combined theoretical simulations and microstructure experiment analysis reveal that Sn atoms dynamically distributed in the liquid Ga matrix act as the main active catalytic center. Meanwhile, Ga provides a uniquely dynamic environment to maintain the long-term integrity of the catalytic system. With the participation of EGaSn, a tailor-made 2 Ah Li–S pouch cell with a specific energy density of 307.7 Wh kg−1 is realized.

The (001) facet-dominated TiN nanoflakes have a strong adsorption capacity for soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). More importantly, theoretical calculations and experiment results confirm the (001) facet-dominated TiN nanoflakes catalyze the conversion of soluble LiPSs to Li2S2/Li2S to induce the Li2S uniform deposition in the discharge process and decrease the delithiation barrier of Li2S in the charge process. Therefore, the excellent electrochemical properties of LSBs are achieved, which demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 949 mAh g−1 at 1 C and maintains high capacity reversibility with a decay rate of 0.033% per cycle after 800 cycles.",Small,10.1002/smll.202202917
Selective sulfur conversion with surface engineering of electrocatalysts in a lithium–sulfur battery,"© 2022 The Authors. Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.The sluggish kinetics of multiphase sulfur conversion with homogeneous and heterogeneous electrochemical processes, causing the “shuttle effect” of soluble polysulfide species (PSs), is the challenges in terms of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). In this paper, a Mn3O4−x catalyst, which has much higher activity for heterogeneous reactions than for homogeneous reactions (namely, preferential-activity catalysts), is designed by surface engineering with rational oxygen vacancies. Due to the rational design of the electronic structure, the Mn3O4−x catalyst prefers to accelerate the conversion of Li2S4 into Li2S2/Li2S and optimize Li2S deposition, reducing the accumulation of PSs and thus suppressing the “shuttle effect.” Both density functional theory calculations and in situ X-ray diffraction measurements are used to probe the catalytic mechanism and identify the reaction intermediates of MnS and LiyMnzO4−x for fundamental understanding. The cell with Mn3O4−x delivers an ultralow attenuation rate of 0.028% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 2.5 C. Even with sulfur loadings of 4.93 and 7.10 mg cm−2 in a lean electrolyte (8.4 µL mg s−1), the cell still shows an initial areal capacity of 7.3 mAh cm−2.

In Situ Grown 1T′-MoTe2 Nanosheets on Carbon Nanotubes as an Efficient Electrocatalyst and Lithium Regulator for Stable Lithium–Sulfur Full Cells,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium–sulfur batteries offer the advantage of high energy density at a low cost, but their viability is hindered by the polysulfide shuttle effect, sluggish reaction kinetics, and dendritic Li growth. To address these persistent challenges in a unified manner, a dual-function, flexible, free-standing framework by coupling catalytic and lithiophilic 1T′-MoTe2 nanosheets with conductive carbon nanotubes (MoTe2-CNT), which serve as a host for both a sulfur cathode (S/MoTe2-CNT) and a lithium-metal anode (MoTe2-CNT/Li) is presented here.

Design of Quasi-MOF Nanospheres as a Dynamic Electrocatalyst toward Accelerated Sulfur Reduction Reaction for High-Performance Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising next-generation rechargeable batteries owing to their high energy density and cost-effectiveness. However, the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction process, which is so far insufficiently explored, still impedes its practical application. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely investigated as a sulfur immobilizer, but the interactions and catalytic activity of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) on metal nodes are weak due to the presence of organic ligands. Herein, a strategy to design quasi-MOF nanospheres, which contain a transition-state structure between the MOF and the metal oxide via controlled ligand exchange strategy, to serve as sulfur electrocatalyst, is presented. The quasi-MOF not only inherits the porous structure of the MOF, but also exposes abundant metal nodes to act as active sites, rendering strong LiPs absorbability. The reversible deligandation/ligandation of the quasi-MOF and its impact on the durability of the catalyst over the course of the electrochemical process is acknowledged, which confers a remarkable catalytic activity. Attributed to these structural advantages, the quasi-MOF delivers a decent discharge capacity and low capacity-fading rate over long-term cycling. This work not only offers insight into the rational design of quasi-MOF-based composites but also provides guidance for application in Li–S batteries.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202105541
Achieving reversible precipitation-decomposition of reactive Li2S towards high-areal-capacity lithium-sulfur batteries with a wide-temperature range,"© 2021Facilitating polysulfide conversion by electrocatalysis is a promising strategy to suppress shuttle effect in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, yet the active sites in electrocatalysts are gradually passivated by continuous formation of Li2S passivation layer over cycling, making it challenging to achieve steady conversion of sulfur species. Herein, a strategy of reactive Li2S collaborated with dual-directional Fe3C electrocatalyst is proposed to achieve fast and continuous conversion of sulfur species for drastically boosting the performance of Li-S batteries. During the reduction process, reactive Li2S with unique three-dimensional porous structure is precipitated on Fe3C surface, which not only shortens ion/electron diffusion path but also exposes and retains more active sites in Fe3C. While for the following oxidation process, Fe3C also promotes the decomposition of reactive Li2S to refresh electrocatalyst surface. Therefore, the high catalytic activity of Fe3C is well retained during the entire electrochemical process, as verified by comprehensive experimental and theoretical calculation results. Eventually, Fe3C enables stable operation of high-areal-capacity Li-S batteries (> 6.0 mAh cm−2) under a wide-temperature range (-10 to 40 °C).

Strategies to catalyze the sulfur liquid/solid conversion within a “hermetic” nano-container have been proposed, where the LiPS migration and sluggish reaction kinetics can be simultaneously addressed. Herein, to realize rapid LiPS conversion and slow LiPS migration, the sulfur species are packed by a hermetic catalytic interface, constructed by the phosphorene/graphene heterostructure. The 2D phosphorene/graphene stacking has two unique benefits: 1) a direct electron transfer avoiding any insulating media, resulting in an exceptional catalytic effect on LiPS conversion; ii) favorable charge rearrangement that enhances chemisorption toward LiPS and limits LiPS crossover. The proposed highly flexible hermetic interface with strong van der Waals serves as a bifunctional nano-container to pack sulfur species and promote sulfur redox reactions, which gives rise to excellent battery performances: a high areal capacity of 5.57 mAh cm−2 under a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5.7 mL g−1.

Herein, a novel N-doped MXene-CoS2 (denote as N-MX-CoS2) nanohybrid is developed by a one-step in situ sulfidation strategy. Owing to the synergistic chemisorption of dopant nitrogen sites and polar CoS2 nanoparticles, such nanohybrid ensures a high ability to adsorb LiPSs. The highly electrical conductivity of MXene substrate with an extended layered structure facilitates fast sulfur electrochemistry redox reaction. We provide a strategy for rational design and fully explore its synergy as an efficient bifunctional heterostructure, which achieves the “all-in-one” results.

A descriptor φ is proposed to correlate the binding energies of the 2D MOFs to the coordination environment and the electronegativity of the TM atoms in the LiPSs via an implicit volcano plot.

Hierarchically Porous Ti3C2MXene with Tunable Active Edges and Unsaturated Coordination Bonds for Superior Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries hold great promise for next-generation electronics owing to their high theoretical energy density, low cost, and eco-friendliness. Nevertheless, the practical implementation of Li-S batteries is hindered by the shuttle effect and sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfides. Herein, the spray drying and chemical etching strategies are implemented to fabricate hierarchically porous MXene microspheres as a multifunctional sulfur electrocatalyst. The interconnected skeleton offers uniform sulfur distribution and prevents the restacking of MXene sheets, while the abundant edges endow the nanosheet-like Ti3C2 with rich active sites and regulated a d-band center of Ti atoms, leading to strong lithium polysulfide (LiPS) adsorption. The unsaturated Ti on edge sites can further act as multifunctional sites for chemically anchoring LiPS and lowering Li-ion migration barriers, accelerating LiPS conversion. Owing to these structural advantages, excellent cycling and rate performances of the sulfur cathode can be obtained, even under a raised sulfur loading and lean electrolyte content.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.1c06213
Rational Design of β-NiOOH Nanosheet-Sheathed CNTs as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Practical Li-S Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.The shuttle effects of polysulfide intermediates (LiPSs) and sluggish kinetics during sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) process severely exacerbate the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries. Herein, a unique nanocatalyst comprising β-NiOOH nanosheets uniformly implanted on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNT@NiOOH) was designed and synthesized for sulfur cathodes. The β-NiOOH nanosheets have great capability of adsorbing LiPSs as well as superior catalytic activity for accelerating LiPS conversion, providing a more efficient method to restrain shuttle effects and improve the kinetics of SRR. Moreover, the nanometer-scale epitaxial growth and uniform distribution of β-NiOOH on CNTs provide a multidimensional catalytic skeleton with sufficient accessible active surfaces, unimpeded LiPS diffusion pathways, and resultant high utilization of active sites. Simultaneously, stable electron transportation pathways are also obtained by being synthesized on CNTs to avoid the faultiness of poor electron conductivity of β-NiOOH. These conspicuous advantages contribute to fully exert the catalytic and LiPS anchoring potential of CNT@NiOOH, bringing about the ultralong cycle performance and excellent capacity reversibility at a high discharge rate. Reticular CNT@NiOOH frameworks are assembled with the sulfur composite materials (SCMs) by a self-assembly method, and a super-high capacity of 813.3 mA h g-1 after 400 cycles at 0.5 C with a small capacity degradation of 0.07% per cycle is achieved. Furthermore, the 3 A h pouch-type cell with the SCM/CNT@NiOOH cathode attains a super-high energy density of about 320 W h kg-1 and shows a superior capacity retention as high as 75.9% after 50 cycles at 0.2 C. This work provides a promising method to accelerate the SRR process and restrain the shuttle effects for practical long-life and high-capacity Li-sulfur batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c19915
"Multiple roles of titanium carbide in performance boosting: Mediator, anchor and electrocatalyst for polysulfides redox regulation","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have attracted more and more attention in recent years owing to its high theoretical energy density, abundant sulfur source and relatively low cost. However, the serious polysulfides shuttle and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics hinder the development and commercial application of high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. In this paper, the titanium carbide (TiC)-decorated carbon matrix is considered as the mediator, anchor and electrocatalyst for polysulfides redox reaction. It has been proved that the conductive and polar titanium carbide can not only chemisorbs lithium polysulfides via titanium-sulfur (Ti-S) coordination, but also optimize the lithium sulfide (Li2S) nucleation/precipitation mechanism for better redox reaction. Especially, the graphene oxide and carbon nanotube matrix (GO-CNT) in this case can act as both host for Li2S loading and TiC precipitation. Accordingly, the as-fabricated lithium sulfide-graphene oxide–carbon nanotube-titanium carbide (LS-GO-CNT-TiC) cathode delivers the high initial discharge capacity of 956 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and good rate capability of 508 mAh g−1 at 2C. These results consequently manifest that the conductive and polar matrix of LS-GO-CNT-TiC can perform as a promising cathode of the high performance LSBs.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.130744
CoFe Alloy-Decorated Interlayer with a Synergistic Catalytic Effect Improves the Electrochemical Kinetics of Polysulfide Conversion,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Good electrical conductivity, strong catalytic activity, high interaction with lithium polysulfides (LIPSs), simple method, and low cost should be considered for the design and preparation of high-performance electrochemical catalysts that catalyze the conversion of LIPSs. In this work, we designed a bimetallic alloyed multifunctional interlayer with multiple adsorption/catalysis sites. The interwoven carbon fibers derived from bacterial cellulose (BC) not only contribute to reducing metal ions to metals but also confine the growth of Co-Fe alloys formed in situ. The metal supported on carbon is very effective for the conversion of LIPSs due to its high adsorption and catalytic sites. In addition, the synergistic effect between Fe and Co species leads to excellent bifunctional catalytic activity. Through detailed electrochemical analysis and theoretical calculations, we revealed that CoFe@CNFs has superior electrocatalytic activity, and the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with a catalytic interlayer can deliver satisfactory rate and cycle performance. At a high current density of 2C, the discharge capacity can still reach 627 mAh g-1. At a current density of 1C, the Coulombic efficiency is maintained at a level close to 100% during the whole cycle process and a satisfying low capacity decay of 0.08% per cycle. More importantly, even if the ambient temperature drops to 0 °C, the Li-S battery using the interlayer can still be charged and discharged normally and shows acceptable discharge capacity, which shows that it has good rate kinetics.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c17374
Semi-Immobilized Molecular Electrocatalysts for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries constitute promising next-generation energy storage devices due to the ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg-1. However, the multiphase sulfur redox reactions with sophisticated homogeneous and heterogeneous electrochemical processes are sluggish in kinetics, thus requiring targeted and high-efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, a semi-immobilized molecular electrocatalyst is designed to tailor the characters of the sulfur redox reactions in working Li-S batteries. Specifically, porphyrin active sites are covalently grafted onto conductive and flexible polypyrrole linkers on graphene current collectors. The electrocatalyst with the semi-immobilized active sites exhibits homogeneous and heterogeneous functions simultaneously, performing enhanced redox kinetics and a regulated phase transition mode. The efficiency of the semi-immobilizing strategy is further verified in practical Li-S batteries that realize superior rate performances and long lifespan as well as a 343 Wh kg-1 high-energy-density Li-S pouch cell. This contribution not only proposes an efficient semi-immobilizing electrocatalyst design strategy to promote the Li-S battery performances but also inspires electrocatalyst development facing analogous multiphase electrochemical energy processes.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.1c09107
Crystal Facet Engineering Induced Active Tin Dioxide Nanocatalysts for Highly Stable Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHControlling exposed crystal facets through crystal facet engineering is an efficient strategy for enhancing the catalytic activity of nanocrystalline catalysts. Herein, the active tin dioxide nano–octahedra enclosed by {332} crystal facets (SnO2 {332}) are synthesized on reduced graphene oxide and demonstrate powerful chemisorption and catalytic ability, accelerating the redox kinetics of sulfur species in lithium–sulfur chemistry.

Ni2P electrocatalysts decorated hollow carbon spheres as bi-functional mediator against shuttle effect and Li dendrite for Li-S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdLithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices, while shuttle effect and Li dendrite growth severely obstruct the practical applications. Herein, well-dispersed Ni2P electrocatalysts decorated hollow carbon spheres (Ni2P-HCS) are constructed as high-efficiency bi-functional mediator for Li-S batteries. Benefiting from polar surface and high electrical conductivity, Ni2P-HCS possesses strong interaction and efficient electrocatalysis toward polysulfides. Moreover, regulated Li deposition behavior is realized on lithiated Ni2P-HCS surface ascribed to its lithiophilicity and as-formed mixed ion-electron conducting host composed of Li3P and Ni. As a result, the assembled Li-S full cells with Ni2P-HCS used as interlayer and Li host exhibit excellent rate capability (755.5 mAh g−1 at 2 C) and long-term cycling stability (capacity fading rate of 0.05% per cycle at 1 C after 500 cycles). Importantly, high areal capacity (6.67 mAh cm−2) with high sulfur loading of 5.9 mg cm−2 at low E/S ratio (6.8 μL mg−1) is achieved.

Highly sulfiphilic zinc selenide/carbon regulators for high-capacity and long-lifespan Li-S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries represent an attractive energy storage technology for the employment in next-generation high-energy–density rechargeable batteries. The main challenge is to increase the electrochemical utilization and stabilization of sulfur cathodes by mitigating the undesirable soluble polysulfide shuttle problem. Herein, a zinc selenide/carbon hybrid (ZnSe/C) is constructed as a regulator of commercial polypropylene (PP) separator to modify the sulfiphilicity of polysulfide species. It is revealed that the polar ZnSe/C hybrid greatly inhibits the shuttling effect by strong chemisorption and thereafter fast electrocatalytic transformation of polysulfides. Accordingly, the ZnSe/C-modified PP separator could kinetically expedite the redox reaction and effectively promotes the utilization and confinement of the active sulfur in the cathode side. As a consequence, the ZnSe/C-PP-cell exhibits excellent electrochemical properties, including an impressive capacity delivery of 1458/605 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C/5 C and long lifetime with 608 mAh g−1 retained after 1000 cycles at 1 C.

Amorphous CoP nanoparticle composites with nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres for synergetic anchoring and catalytic conversion of polysulfides in Li-S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.The commercial viability of Li-S batteries was obstructed by short cycle life and poor capability owing to slow redox kinetics and polysulfide shuttle effect. To tackle these challenges, the amorphous CoP anchored on N-doped carbon nanospheres with hollow porous structures (CoP/HCS) has been synthesized as a superior sulfur host via a facial pyrolysis approach. The debilitating effect would be hampered during the cycling processing resulting from two reasons:(1) the powerful chemical anchoring between unsaturated Co and Li-polysulfides, (2) the remarkable adaption of volume variation originating from the hollow porous architectures. The amorphous CoP nanoparticles not only catalyze the transformation of lithium polysulfides as electrocatalyst, but also acquired a high sulfur loading as sulfur host materials. More importantly, the synergistic incorporation of CoP and HCS improved the inherit low conductivity by anchoring on the N-doped carbon hollow, thus leading to excellent performance for Li-S batteries. Benefiting from these advantages, the amorphous CoP/HCS-based sulfur electrodes exhibited outstanding rate performance (685.6 mAh g−1 at 3C), excellent long-cycling stability with a low capacity decay of only 0.03% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2C, and a high areal capacity of 5.16 mAh cm−2 under high sulfur loading.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2021.06.059
Scalable Production of Freestanding Few-Layer β12-Borophene Single Crystalline Sheets as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Two-dimensional (2D) borophene has attracted tremendous interest due to its fascinating properties, which have potential applications in catalysts, energy storage devices, and high-speed transistors. In the past few years, borophene was theoretically predicted as an ideal electrode material for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries because of its low-density, metallic conductivity, high Li-ion surface mobility, and strong interface bonding energy to polysulfide. But until now, borophene-based Li-S batteries have not yet been achieved in experiments due to the absence of a large-scale synthetic method of freestanding borophene nanostructures with a high enough structural stability, conductivity, and uniformity. Herein, we developed a low-Temperature liquid exfoliation (LTLE) method to synthesize freestanding few-layer β12-borophene single-crystalline sheets with a P6¯m2 symmetry in tens of milligrams. The as-synthesized 2D sheets were used as the polysulfide immobilizers and electrocatalysts of Li-S batteries. The resulting borophene-based Li-S battery delivered an extralarge areal capacity of 5.2 mAh cm-2 at a high sulfur loading of 7.8 mg cm-2, an excellent rate performance of 8 C (@721 mAh g-1), and an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.039% in 1000 cycles, outperforming commercial Li-ion batteries and many other 2D material-based Li-S batteries. Based on the density functional theory model, the excellent electrochemical performances of the borophene-based Li-S batteries should originate from the enormous enhancement of β12-borophene sheets for both the surface migration of the Li-ions and the adsorption energy of Li2Sn clusters. Our results thus demonstrate a great potential for scalable production of freestanding β12-borophene single-crystalline sheets in future high-performance Li-S batteries.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.1c04961

Functionalized Mo2B2 MBenes: Promising anchoring and electrocatalysis materials for Lithium-Sulfur battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Applications of Li-S batteries are primarily hindered by shuttling effect, poor electronic conductivity of sulfur and inactive decomposition of low-order lithium polysulfide (LiPS). To solve these problems, the anchoring and electrocatalysis properties of two-dimensional transition metal boride (MBene) have been extensively studied to provide general design principles for enhanced electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries. Our results show that direct application of bare Mo2B2 MBene in Li-S battery gives rise to the decomposition of high-order LiPSs, which originates from the excessively strong binding strength between S atoms and surface Mo atoms. Then, we highlight that surface functionalization on Mo2B2 MBene possesses suitable anchoring performance to suppress the shuttling effect. Meanwhile, owing to the excellent electronic conductivity even after the adsorption of LiPS, the functionalized MBenes effectively stimulate the redox electrochemistry in Li-S battery. Finally, accompanied with omnidirectional fast diffusion of Li atom, the functionalized MBene exhibits superior electrocatalysis activity for Li2S decomposition with ultra-low diffusion (0.191 eV) and decomposition (0.441 eV) barriers, improving the capability and coulombic efficiency of Li-S batteries.

The unique 3DOM framework provides abundant space for sulfur accommodation and effective pathways for electrolyte infiltration. The robust titanium oxynitride skeleton also ensures good structural integrity during the repeated charge/discharge cycling. Meanwhile, the introduction of oxygen defects not only improves the intrinsic conductivity of the TiO2 skeleton but also enhances its capability for lithium polysulfide (LiPS) trapping. The N-CNTs embedded in the macroporous framework form an ultra-high conductive network and also provide rich micropores for sulfur distribution and physical confinement.

Bio-inspired construction of electrocatalyst decorated hierarchical porous carbon nanoreactors with enhanced mass transfer ability towards rapid polysulfide redox reactions,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Li-S batteries are considered as a highly promising candidate for the next-generation energy storage system, attributing to their tremendous energy density. However, the two-dimensional island nucleation-growth process of lithium sulfide leads to a thick insulating film covering the electrode, inducing slow electrons transfer and mass-transfer of ions and liquid sulfur species in working Li-S cells. Here, we demonstrate a bio-inspired strategy of constructing ant-nest-like hierarchical porous ultrathin carbon nanosheet networks with the implants of metallic nanoparticles electrocatalysts (HPC-MEC) as efficient nanoreactors enabling rapid mass transfer, via a simple and green NaCl template. Such nanoreactors with a large active surface area could effectively anchor polysulfides for mitigating the shuttle effect, facilitating uniformly thin Li2S film, and promoting the mass transfer for fast sulfur species conversions. This helps contribute to a continuously high sulfur utilization in Li-S batteries with the HPC-MEC reactors. As a typical exhibition, cobalt embedded hierarchical porous carbon (HPC-Co) could realize to deliver a remarkably high specific capacity of 1,540.6 mAh·g−1, an excellent rate performance of 878.8 mAh·g−1 at 2 C, and high area capacity of 11.6 mAh·cm−2 at a high sulfur load of 10 mg·cm−2 and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5 µL·mg−1.

Polarity-induced precipitation of S/Li2S confined into N and S co-doped porous graphene layered matrix for lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2021The large-scale application of lithium sulfur batteries is impeded by their cycling stability and power performance mainly due to the polysulfide shuttle effect and low conductivity of sulfur. Herein, a multifunctional sulfur host of N/S co-doped porous graphene layered matrix (NSPG) is fabricated. High specific surface area of NSPG can guarantee the homogeneous deposition and high utilization of S/Li2S. Moreover, the layered graphene skeleton with abundant crumples can not only construct efficient channels for fast electrolyte ion/electron transfer but also effectively buffer the volume expansion of S during long-time charge/discharge process. DFT calculations verify that the N/S co-doping can promote the redox reaction rate and inhibit the polysulfides shuttle effect through chemical bonding interaction. Benefiting from the above synergistic effects, the NSPG/S electrode exhibits excellent rate performance (646 mAh g−1 at 10C) and outstanding cycle stability (693 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles). Even at a high mass loading of 4.5 mg cm−2, a capacity of 786 mAh g−1 can be retained after 100 cycles.

Basal-Plane-Activated Molybdenum Sulfide Nanosheets with Suitable Orbital Orientation as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are one of the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage systems because of their high theoretical energy density. However, the shuttling behavior and sluggish conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) limit their practical application. Herein, B-doped MoS2 nanosheets are synthesized on carbon nanotubes (denoted as CNT@MoS2-B) to function as catalysts to boost the performance of Li-S batteries. The poor catalytic performance of the pristine MoS2 is revealed to be the result of unsuitable orbital orientation of the basal plane, which hinders the orbital overlap with sulfur species. B in CNT@MoS2-B is sp3 hybridized, and it has a vacant σ orbital perpendicular to the basal plane, which can maximize the head-on orbital overlap with S. The incorporation of B significantly increases the reactivity of MoS2 basal plane, which can facilitate the kinetics of Li2S formation and dissolution. With these merits, the S/CNT@MoS2-B cathodes deliver high rate capability and outstanding cycling stability, holding great promise for both scientific research and practical application. This work affords fresh insights for developing effective catalysts to accelerate LiPS conversion.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.1c06067
Efficient Polysulfide Trapping and Conversion on N-Doped CoTe2 via Enhanced Dual-Anchoring Effect,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHPolysulfide shuttling and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics hinder the cyclability and rate capability of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. The intrinsic redox kinetics of sulfur cathodes strongly depends on the interaction between catalysts and sulfur species. Herein, N-doped CoTe2 is proposed as an effective dual-anchoring electrocatalyst, which can simultaneously bind Li and S atoms in lithium polysulfides via ionic Te–Li/N–Li bonding and coordinate covalent Co–S bonding. The incorporated N not only serves as enhanced lithiophilic site, but also an agent to improve the sulfiphilicity of the Co site as revealed by a series of experimental and computational results. Benefiting from these superiorities, the use of N-doped CoTe2 as a catalytic interlayer enables efficient operation of Li–S batteries in terms of impressive rate capability of 758 mAh g−1 at 4 C and very low capacity decay of 0.021% per cycle over 1000 cycles.

Size-Dependent Cobalt Catalyst for Lithium Sulfur Batteries: From Single Atoms to Nanoclusters and Nanoparticles,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe sulfur redox conversion with catalytically improved kinetics is promising to mitigate the polysulfides shuttling. While the size of electrocatalyst always brings different catalytic behaviors for various heterogeneous catalytic reactions, it is yet to be explored for Li-S batteries. Herein, a systematical study of size-dependent catalytic activity toward polysulfides conversion and the relevance to electrochemical performance are reported, by constructing Co catalysts with different atomic scales from single atoms, atomic clusters to nanoparticles. Fundamental electrocatalytic studies are focused by probing the reduction kinetics and activation energies of sulfur chemistry. The single atomic Co shows the best charge transfer/kinetic toward sulfur redox, especially for the rate-determining reaction (Li2S4 ↔ Li2S) as demonstrated by the significantly lowered energy barrier for Li2S nucleation/dissolution. This is owing to stronger geometric deformation of the catalyst with lower aggregation extent when it interacts with sulfur species, thus leading to decreased Gibbs free energy changes as elucidated by DFT calculations. The superior catalytic activity of single atomic Co promises a high specific capacity (4.98 mAh cm−2) at an areal loading of 4.3 mg cm−2 over long-term cycling. The finding emphasizes the significance of the size-dependent catalytic activity to the reaction kinetics and the overall performance of Li-S batteries.",Small Methods,10.1002/smtd.202100571

While rationally designed redox mediators can facilitate polysulfide conversion, favorable bidirectional sulfur electrocatalysis remains a formidable challenge. Herein, selective dual-defect engineering (i.e., introducing both N-doping and Se-vacancies) of a common MoSe2 electrocatalyst is used to manipulate the bidirectional Li2S redox. Systematic theoretical prediction and detailed electrokinetic analysis reveal the selective electrocatalytic effect of the two types of defects, thereby achieving a deeper mechanistic understanding of the bidirectional sulfur electrochemistry. The Li–S battery using this electrocatalyst exhibits excellent cyclability, with a low capacity decay rate of 0.04% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2.0 C. More impressively, the potential for practical applications is highlighted by a high areal capacity (7.3 mAh cm−2) and the construction of a flexible pouch cell. Such selective electrocatalysis created by dual-defect engineering is an appealing approach toward working Li–S systems.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202103050

In this study, a novel conjugated micro/mesoporous polymer (ST-CMP) is developed by rational design of the organic condensation reaction of squaric acid and 1,3,5-Tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene, which can uniformly wrap onto carbon nanotube (CNT) as assembled nanotentacle, serving as the highly efficient sulfur electrocatalyst for Li-S batteries. In this composite, the cross-linked CNT conductive network significantly improves the electron transfer and reaction kinetics of active materials. In addition, the ST-CMP assembled nanotentacle prevents the restacking or aggregation of ST-CMP, favoring the exposure of active sites on ST-CMP for efficient LiPSs chemical interaction. The abundant polymeric zwitterions in ST-CMP with uniformly distributed positively polarized N atoms and negatively polarized O atoms can not only empower comprehensive regulation of LiPSs adsorption, but also simultaneously allow accelerated LiPSs catalytic conversion, rendering admirable redox reaction kinetics. With these merits, the obtained S/ST-CMP@CNT composites exhibit a high initial specific capacity of 1307 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C with an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.047% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1 C, exhibiting great potential in developing Li-S batteries with decent performance.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202101926

Herein, Co-Bi nanosheets intimately grown on reduced graphene oxides (Co-Bi/rGO) composite has been reported for the first time to regulate the polysulfide intermediates. The Co-Bi could not only chemically trap polysulfides but also propel the acceleration of polysulfide conversion enabled by a lower free energy and decomposition energy barrier in Li–S reaction process. Therefore, the Co-Bi/rGO–S cathode delivers a high capacity of 1334 mAh g–1 at 0.2 C, impressive rate performance up to 8 C, outstanding cycling stability over 500 cycles at 1 C, and remarkable areal capacity of 8.3 mAh cm–2 with a high sulfur mass loading of 9.5 mg cm–2.

Improving poisoning resistance of electrocatalysts via alloying strategy for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Transition metals (TMs) are attractive electrocatalysts for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries due to their strong adsorption of sulfur species based on Lewis acid-base interactions and high intrinsic conductivity. However, S8 molecule undergoes dissociation on their surfaces, resulting in sulfur-poisoned TMs with reduced catalytic sites. We propose here an alloying strategy which changes the S adsorption sites and the corresponding binding energies, enabling intact adsorption of S8 as evidenced by theoretical and experimental results. Such merit renders Co-Te alloy a superior catalyst which effectively expedites the sulfur redox reactions and suppresses the shuttle effect. Consequently, the cathode with Co-Te alloy catalyst delivers an impressive rate capability of 898 mAh g−1 at 2 C together with a low capacity decay of 0.03% per cycle over 1000 cycles. Even the sulfur mass loading is up to 5.4 mg cm−2, a stable capacity of 5.0 mAh cm−2 can be still maintained after 100 cycles.

Regulating the polysulfide redox kinetics for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries through highly sulfiphilic FeWO4 nanorods,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Owing to their high theoretical capacity, energy density, good environmental protection, and low cost, lithium-sulfur batteries are regarded as extremely promising next-generation energy storage equipment for electrical and portable devices. However, their practical application is mainly hindered by the polysulfide shuttle and the slow redox kinetic in the electrochemical process. In this study, we prepared FeWO4 nanorods by a simple hydrothermal method to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. The FeWO4 nanorods act as catchers and electrocatalyst for polysulfide in lithium sulfur batteries. These FeWO4 nanorods could efficiently adsorb polysulfide and enhance the conduction of Li ions, leading to inhibition of the polysulfide shuttle effect and enhancement of the electrochemical reaction kinetic for cycling stability and rate performance. Density functional theory calculation shows the existence of the high binding energy between FeWO4 nanorods and polysulfide, which can limit polysulfide to the surface of FeWO4 nanorods.

All-in-One Sulfur Host: Smart Controls of Architecture and Composition for Accelerated Liquid-Solid Redox Conversion in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.The development of Li-S batteries (LSBs) is largely impeded by sluggish redox kinetics and notorious polysulfide shuttling. Herein, hierarchical MoC@Ni-NCNT arrays are reported as a multifunctional sulfur host in Li-S batteries, which comprised a flexible carbon fiber cloth substrate decorated with vertical MoC porous nanorods rooted by interconnected nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs).

However, issues such as severe polarization and poor cycle stability caused by shuttle effect and slow sulfur redox kinetics limit their practical applications. Here, Co3Fe7 alloy embedded into nitrogen-doped hollow carbon sphere composite (CoFe/NHCS) was synthesized as an electrocatalyst for Li-S batteries.

The effectiveness of electrocatalysis reduces under the lean electrolyte condition due to the preponderance of solid reaction products (sulfur and Li2S) in a small amount of electrolyte; and the difficulty of catalyzing solid sulfur and Li2S.

We revealed the key roles of Fe3C and metallic Fe on modulating polysulfide conversion, in that the polar Fe3C strongly adsorbs polysulfide whereas the Fe particles catalyze fast polysulfide conversion. We then highlight the superior performance of the rational host with strongly coupled Fe3C and Fe on mesoporous Fe-N-C host on promoting nearly complete polysulfide conversion, especially for the challenging short-chain Li2S4 conversion to Li2S. The electrodeposited Li2S on this host was extremely reactive and can be readily charged back to S with minimal activation overpotential. Overall, Li-S batteries equipped with the novel sulfur host delivered a high specific capacity of 1350 mAh g-1 at 0.1C with a capacity retention of 96% after 200 cycles.

However, the shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics of the polysulfides severely hinders the development of Li-S batteries. To overcome these issues, a prismatic-like N-doped carbon tubes embedded with Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4-PNCT) as an efficient sulfur host for advanced Li-S batteries is rationally designed and prepared by a self-templating method in this work. With the high conductivity and hollow structure, the Fe3O4-PNCT can effectively accelerate electron and ion transfer rate, relieve volume expansion and anchor polysulfides intermediates. More importantly, polar Fe3O4 as electrocatalysts uniformly distributed embedding in hollow N-doped carbon shell can not only efficiently adsorb polysulfides on the conductive sulfur host surface, but also significantly promote catalyze transformation of polysulfides, which has been actually revealed by experiments and DFT results. Benefiting from these merits, the sulfur cathode with Fe3O4-PNCT delivers excellent electrochemical performances including high sulfur utilization (1375 mAh g−1 at 0.1C), superior rate performance (685 mAh g−1 at 5C) and remarkable cycling stability up to 1000 cycles at 5C with a super low capacity-fade rate of 0.03% per cycle.

The PCM possesses micro-, meso- and macropores that provide effective adsorption of polysulfides and accommodation of volume-expanded Li2S as indicated by post-discharge SEM examinations. The embedment of FeP nanoparticles within the PCM ensures maximized exposure of catalytic sites and their improved interactions with sulfur redox species under the confinement effect of carbon nanopores. Compared with Fe3O4, which shows a stronger polysulfide binding strength, FeP offers a balance between effective polysulfide trapping and elevated conversion kinetics for the subsequent liquid-solid transitions. Significantly improved sulfur utilizations and confinement are obtained for Li2S deposition and decomposition, which are regarded as the rate- and capacity-limiting steps during charge/discharge. Detailed working mechanisms are revealed by electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations.

In this work, 3D MoS2 nanoporous spheres (MoS2-NPSs), exposing abundant active edges by decorating on conductive reduced graphene oxide aerogels (rGOA/GA), were fabricated as an S host to construct the S@MoS2@GA cathodes.

However, the durable operation for the batteries is blocked by the shuttle behavior of soluble lithium polysulfides and the sluggish kinetics in the redox process. Here, VN nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped graphene (VN/NG) composite is synthesized by simple calcining method to modify the separators, which can not only chemically trap polysulfides, but also catalyze the conversion reaction between the polysulfides and the insoluble Li2S during the charge/discharge process. The catalytic effects of VN/NG are verified by the calculated activation energy (Ea), which is smaller than the counterpart with NG toward both directions of redox.

Moreover, poor sulfur electrochemical utilization and rapid capacity degradation are top concerns in the high-loading Li-S batteries, which severely hinder their practical applications. Herein, a completely novel porous nanoneedle array NiCo2S4 electrocatalyst grown on a nitrogen-sulfur-doped carbon cloth (NSCC) (NiCo2S4@NSCC) is constructed as a 3D self-supported sulfur host for high-loading Li-S batteries, in which the highest sulfur loading reaches 4.9 mg cm-2. The as-prepared NiCo2S4@NSCC with a typical sulfur loading of around 2.0 mg cm-2 provides a high discharge capacity of 1223 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C and long-term cycle stability with a low capacity decay of 0.046% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C.

However, the detrimental polysulfide shuttle effect and the sluggish redox kinetics of Li-S batteries are the major obstacles to the development of high-performance Li-S batteries. In this study, a synergistic engineering layer comprising a versatile H2Ti3O7 electrocatalyst and conductive supporting materials (HTO-sCNT-G) was developed for advanced Li-S batteries. In the ingenious three-dimensional internal hierarchical percolating microstructure of HTO-sCNT-G, the polar H2Ti3O7 nanowires acted as an effective mediator of polysulfide (PS) conversion and suppressed the shuttle effect due to their strong chemical interaction with PSs, while the carbon components (CNTs and graphene) provided a three-dimensional conductive network that increased the electronic conductivity of H2Ti3O7. Furthermore, the hierarchical porous structure without graphene overstacking increased the accessible surface area for rapid Li+ diffusion, thereby improving the ionic conductivity, and HTO-sCNT-G acted as an auxiliary sulfur host, providing an additional conductive network to reutilize the trapped PSs. Owing to the synergistic effect of HTO-sCNT-G, the resultant Li-S batteries exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance with a significantly high reversibility (1001 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.2C and 794 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 1C with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.057% per cycle) and improved rate capabilities at different current rates (792.1, 631.7, and 509.5 mA h g-1 at 1, 2, and 3C).

Using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, the Fe-N4 center is found to be an efficient electrocatalyst to propel the reversible conversion between LiPSs and Li2S, inhibit the LiPS shuttling and mediate the deposition of Li2S. As a result, S@Fe-N/MHCS exhibits significantly improved rate properties and cycling stability (only 0.0187% capacity fade in 1000 cycles at 1C) without using conductive carbon. Even at a practical high sulfur loading (5.4 mg cm-2) and low E/S ratio (8.0 μL mg-1), the areal capacity reaches 6.4 mA h cm-2 and 81.7% of it is retained after 100 cycles. Furthermore, a S@Fe-N/MHCS pouch cell is also assembled showing exceptional cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 77.1% after 200 cycles.

Conventional carbon-based and transition metal compound-based material solutions generally suffer from poor catalysis and adsorption, respectively, despite the performance gain in terms of the other. Herein, we have enhanced polysulfide adsorption-catalytic capability and protected the Li anode using a complementary bimetallic carbide electrocatalyst, Co3Mo3C, modified commercial separator. With this demonstration, the potentials of bimetal compounds, which have been well recognized in other environmental catalysis, are also extended to Li-S batteries.

A feasible path for improving the volumetric energy density of the cathode is to increase the utilization of active materials within a limited volume. However, the sluggish conversion kinetics and severe migration of polysulfides hinder its development. Herein, different from simple additives with large aggregation, we propose in situ growth of ultra-small tungsten carbide nanoparticles on highly conductive nanocarbon in a relatively low-temperature process.

The main drawbacks in the development of long-life Li-S batteries are capacity fading and the sluggish kinetics at the cathode caused by the polysulfides shuttle. These limitations are addressed through the design of novel nanocages containing cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles embedded in highly porous nitrogen-doped carbon (CoP-N-GC) by thermal annealing of ZIF-67 in a reductive atmosphere followed by a phosphidation step using sodium hypophosphite. The CoP nanoparticles, with large surface area and uniform homogeneous distribution within the N-doped nanocage graphitic carbon, act as electrocatalysts to suppress the shuttle of soluble polysulfides through strong chemical interactions and catalyze the sulfur redox. As a result, the S@CoP-N-GC electrode delivers an extremely high specific capacity of 1410 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C=1675 mA g−1) with an excellent coulombic efficiency of 99.7 %. Moreover, capacity retention from 864 to 678 mA h g−1 is obtained after 460 cycles with a very low decay rate of 0.046 % per cycle at 0.5 C.

Enhanced Catalytic Conversion of Polysulfides Using Bimetallic Co7Fe3for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been severely hindered by their low capacity, poor rate performance, and fast capacity degradation, which mainly originate from the notorious polysulfide shuttle effect. Herein, with density functional theory calculations, we show that the alloying of Fe into carbon-coated Co not only provides moderate binding interactions with the polysulfides to hinder their diffusion but also serves as an active catalyst in the spontaneous and successive lithiation of S8 to Li2S. Based on the fast migration of Li ions and the spontaneous lithiation of Li2S2 on the carbon-coated Fe-Co alloy, the entrapping-conversion processes of polysulfides are both thermodynamically and kinetically promoted in redox cycling. Experimentally, rationally designed Co7Fe3@porous graphite carbon-carbon nanotubes (Co7Fe3@PGC-CNT) electrocatalysts are introduced into Li-S batteries through separator functionalization. Consistent with theoretical predictions, Li-S batteries with Co7Fe3@PGC-CNT modified separators exhibit a dramatically enhanced rate capacity (788 and 631 mAh g-1 at 10 and 15 C rates, respectively) and cycling stability (a slow capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2.0 C), which are superior to those of most reported Li-S batteries coupled with state-of-the-art separators.

Defective VSe2-Graphene Heterostructures Enabling in Situ Electrocatalyst Evolution for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Electrocatalysts remain vitally important for the rational management of intermediate polysulfides (LiPSs) in the realm of Li-S batteries. In terms of transition-metal-based candidates, in situ evolution of electrocatalysts in the course of an electrochemical process has been acknowledged; nevertheless, consensus has not yet been reached on their real functional states as well as catalytic mechanisms. Herein, we report an all-chemical vapor deposition design of the defective vanadium diselenide (VSe2)-vertical graphene (VG) heterostructure on carbon cloth (CC) targeting a high-performance sulfur host. The electrochemistry induces the sulfurization of VSe2 to VS2 at Se vacancy sites, which propels the adsorption and conversion of LiPSs. Accordingly, the VSe2-VG@CC/S electrode harvests an excellent cycling stability at 5.0 C with a capacity decay of only 0.039% per cycle over 800 cycles, accompanied by a high areal capacity of 4.9 mAh cm-2 under an elevated sulfur loading of 9.6 mg cm-2. Theoretical simulation combined with operando characterizations reveals the key role played by the Se vacancy with respect to the electrocatalyst evolution and LiPS regulation. This work offers insight into the rational design of heterostructure sulfur hosts throughout defect engineering.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.0c05030
Rational valence modulation of bimetallic carbide assisted by defect engineering to enhance polysulfide conversion for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.The reasonable design of metal compound electrocatalysts is proved to be a good approach to accelerate the sluggish conversion kinetics of polysulfides for high performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Since metal cations usually serve as the active sites to interact with polysulfides, optimizing their electronic and valence states is vital to enhance catalytic activity, especially for electrochemical reactions involving multiple electrons. Herein, the electronic and valence states of metal active sites in hollow carbon-encapsulated Ni3ZnC0.7(denoted as C/Ni3ZnC0.7) nanospheres are modulated by introducing either donor defects (P dopants) or acceptor defects (Ni vacancies)viaP-doping or NaBH4-etching, respectively. Such P dopants and Ni vacancies not only endow P-doped C/Ni3ZnC0.7(denoted as C/Ni3ZnC0.7-Pm) and NaBH4-etched C/Ni3ZnC0.7(denoted as C/Ni3ZnC0.7-Bn) nanospheres with abundant defects and distortions, but also modulate the valence states of metal active sites in different ways. P dopants and accompanied Zn vacancies remarkably decrease the electron density of Zn active sites in C/Ni3ZnC0.7-P5 while the Ni vacancies contribute to the dramatic increase of Ni2+species in C/Ni3ZnC0.7-B1 nanospheres. The modulated Zn sites could anchor polysulfides and serve as reservoirs to regulate the valence of Ni sites. However, the modulated Ni active sites with more Ni2+species enable fast electron transfer between the Ni2+/Ni(0) pair and polysulfides, playing a more significant role in catalyzing the conversion of polysulfides. As a result, compared with C/Ni3ZnC0.7and C/Ni3ZnC0.7-P5, C/Ni3ZnC0.7-B1 with more Ni2+species exhibits stronger chemical adsorption ability toward polysulfides and catalytic ability to accelerate the conversion kinetics of polysulfides. When C/Ni3ZnC0.7-B1 nanospheres are used to modify commonly used PP separators for Li-S batteries, remarkable rate performance up to 4.0C (525.6 mA h g−1) and excellent cycling stability (a decay of 0.0179% over 1400 cycles at 1.0C) are achieved.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta05927g
CoS2-Decorated Cobalt/Nitrogen Co-Doped Carbon Nanofiber Networks as Dual Functional Electrocatalysts for Enhancing Electrochemical Redox Kinetics in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been considerably studied in energy storage systems because of their extremely high energy density. Nevertheless, poor sulfur utilization and lower sulfur loading, polysulfides shuttling, and short cycling life are the major obstacles to their application. Herein, we present the cubic structure of CoS2 microcrystals decorated on Co/N-codoped carbon nanofibers (denoted as CSCNC) by an electrospinning technique followed by a hydrothermal process. The Li2S6 catholyte was added in the fibrous CSCNC network as the current free electrode for Li-S batteries, which was used as the positive catalyst to restrain the shuttle effect and facilitate the reaction kinetics. Additionally, CoS2 and Co are dual functional electrocatalysts for facilitating lithium sulfide nucleation onto the surface of CSCNC, thus reduce electrochemical polarization and enhance the specific capacity. This CSCNC@Li2S6 electrode exhibits 877 mAh g-1 capacity retention with sulfur loading of 7.11 mg over 200 cycles and has an average decay of 0.11% per cycle. Additionally, the composite electrode with sulfur loading accomplishes up to 14.22 mg, providing 12.7 mAh of extremely high capacity, which is much higher than that of the carbon-based electrodes for Li-S batteries.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c02869
Boosting the anchoring and catalytic capability of MoS2for high-loading lithium sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.A high sulfur loading and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio are considered prerequisites for practical high-energy lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs); however, shuttling and the sluggish conversion of flooded polysulfides make it challenging to achieve the full utilization of active materials with an extended cyclic life. Herein, we explore 1T MoS2nanodots as powerful electrocatalyst to overcome this issue. Electrochemical and synchrotronin situX-ray diffraction characterizations revealed that 1T MoS2nanodots with numerous active sites are favored to trap and propel the redox reactions for polysulfides. First-principle calculations indicated that the surface and Mo-terminated edges of 1T MoS2provide stronger anchor sites for Li2S, a lower Li-S decomposition barrier, and faster Li ion migration than those for the 2H phase, which suggest the unique catalytic property for edge-rich 1T MoS2nanodots in LSBs. In the presence of a small amount of 1T MoS2nanodots, porous carbon/Li2S6cathodes exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance retaining a capacity of 9.3 mA h cm−2over 300 cycles under high sulfur loading of 12.9 mg cm−2and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 4.6 μL mg−1, which rivals the performance of the state-of-the-art LSBs.

Constructing Defect-Rich MoS2/N-Doped Carbon Nanosheets for Catalytic Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Polysulfide dissolution is one of the inherent challenges in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). The shuttle effect of soluble polysulfide species between the cathode and the anode can cause the loss of active materials and the attenuation of specific capacity in LSBs. Herein, the N-doped porous carbon (NC) nanosheets with uniformly anchored defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2/NC) were constructed by a simple and low-cost method. The NC nanosheets facilitate transfer of lithium ion and electron and localize polysulfides via the Li-N chemical bond. The defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets can be used as electrocatalysts to propel polysulfide conversion by abundant catalytic activity sites and thus control the shuttle effect as well as improve cycling performances of LSBs. Consequently, the defect-rich MoS2/NC composites as separator modification present a high specific capacity of 1021 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C after 100 cycles and superior long-term performances with enhanced specific capacities of 429 mAh g-1 with a low capacity fading rate of 0.027% per cycle at 5 C after 1000 cycles. The reasonable construct strategy of defect-rich MoS2/NC composites is effective in enhancing the electrochemical performances of LSBs and promoting their commercial applications.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c03887

This work presents a potent strategy to solve these challenges by developing a new tantalum-based electrocatalyst for the Li-S system. The “ship in a bottle” nanostructure of electrocatalyst featuring efficient crystallinity tuning and tailored oxygen defects enables a superior catalytic activity and stability for sulfur redox reactions, which lead to a significant increase in Li-S battery performance at practically relevant sulfur loadings and electrolyte content. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Polysulfide retention and catalysis are currently among the most important factors toward solving much of the technical challenges of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries.

Molybdenum carbide nanocrystals modified carbon nanofibers as electrocatalyst for enhancing polysulfides redox reactions in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 John Wiley & Sons LtdThe high performance of lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries is the focus of research in recent years. However, the low sulfur loading, shuttling effect in electrolyte, and poor cycling stability limit their applications. Herein, molybdenum carbide nanocrystals embedded carbon nanofibers (Mo2C@CFs: MCCFs) hybrid membrane was prepared in situ on CFs membrane based on carbonthermal reduction of ammonium molybdate. The fibrous MCCFs network is used as the current collector with Li2S6 catholyte solution for Li-S batteries, which inhibits the shuttle effect and accelerates kinetics redox reaction. In addition, Mo2C, as electrocatalyst, promotes nucleation of Li2S of the MCCFs substance, which can reduce polarization and increase the specific capacity. As a result, the free-standing MCCFs@Li2S6 electrode (sulfur loading: 4.74 mg) shows a capacity of 977 mAh g−1 and maintains at 828 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C over 250 cycles, and indicates excellent reversibility and cycling stability. Even with sulfur loading as high as 7.11 mg, the MCCF@Li2S6 electrode exhibits an extremely high capacity of 5.75 mAh. Meanwhile, the Mo2C modified CFs can be effectively retarding the self-discharge behavior by trapping the polysulfides. Furthermore, the stability improvement of lithium anode state by effectively suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfide, played an important role in enhancing the electrochemical performance.",International Journal of Energy Research,10.1002/er.5510
The electrocatalytic activity of BaTiO3 nanoparticles towards polysulfides enables high-performance lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2020The slow redox dynamics and dissolution of polysulfides in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries result in poor rate performance and rapid decay of battery capacity, thus limiting their practical application. Ferroelectric barium titanate (BT) nanoparticles have been reported to effectively improve the electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries due to the inherent self-polarization and high adsorption capacity of the BT nanoparticles towards polysulfides. Here in this paper, BT nanoparticles, behave as highly efficient electrocatalyst and demonstrate much higher redox dynamics towards the conversion reaction of polysulfides and Li2S than TiO2, as shown by both electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculation. The coupling of the sulfur host of the hollow and graphitic carbon flakes (HGCF) and the BT nanoparticles (HGCF/S-BT) enable excellent electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries, delivering a 0.047% capacity decay per cycle in 1000 cycles at 1 C, 788 mAh g–1 at 2 C and a reversible capacity of 613 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at a current density of 0.5 C at a S loading of 3.4 mg cm–2.

Atomic-Scale Dispersed Fe-Based Catalysts Confined on Nitrogen-Doped Graphene for Li-S Batteries: Polysulfides with Enhanced Conversion Efficiency,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium-sulfur batteries have been considered as potential electrochemical energy-storage devices owing to their satisfactory theoretical energy density. Nonetheless, the inferior conversion efficiency of polysulfides in essence leads to fast capacity decay during the discharge/charge cycle. In this work, it is successfully demonstrated that the conversion efficiency of lithium polysulfides is remarkably enhanced by employing a well-distributed atomic-scale Fe-based catalyst immobilized on nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe@NG) as a coating of separator in lithium-sulfur batteries. The quantitative electrocatalytic efficiency of the conversion of lithium polysulfides is determined through cyclic voltammetry. It is also proven that the Fe-NX configuration with highly catalytic activity is quite beneficial for the conversion of lithium polysulfides. In addition, the adsorption and permeation experiments distinctly indicate that the strong anchoring effect, originated from the charge redistribution of N doping into the graphene matrix, inhibits the movement of lithium polysulfides. Thanks to these advantages, if the as-prepared Fe@NG catalyst is combined with polypropylene and applied as a separator (Fe@NG/PP) in Li-S batteries, a high initial capacity (1616 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C), excellent capacity retention (93 % at 0.2 C, 70 % at 2 C), and superb rate performance (820 mA h g−1 at 2 C) are achieved.",Chemistry - A European Journal,10.1002/chem.202001282

Herein, conductive hollow cobalt nitride/carbon (Co5.47Nx-C) spheres with nitrogen vacancies are developed as a high-performance cathode material for use in lithium-sulfur batteries. Nitrogen vacancies are formed by annealing a zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-67) precursor in ammonia. Benefiting from its Co-N bonds and nitrogen-vacancy sites, the Co5.47Nx-C composite achieves strong anchoring of polysulfides, fast polysulfide conversion, and accelerated lithium-ion transport. The strong anchoring effect of Co5.47Nx is confirmed by experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Because of its high conductivity and nitrogen vacancies, the Co5.47Nx cathode exhibits faster redox reaction kinetics and lower polarization than a Co5.47N cathode without nitrogen vacancies, thus realizing promising rate and cycling performance. The optimized Co5.47Nx-C electrode delivers a capacity of 850 mA h g-1 at 0.5C and a rate performance of 320 mA h g-1 at 10C.

In situ sulfur-doped graphene nanofiber network as efficient metal-free electrocatalyst for polysulfides redox reactions in lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2020The major challenge for realistic application of Li-S batteries lies in the great difficulty in breaking through the obstacles of the sluggish kinetics and polysulfides shuttle of the sulfur cathode at high sulfur loading for continuously high sulfur utilization during prolonged charge-discharge cycles. Here we demonstrate that large percentage of sulfur can be effectively incorporated within a three-dimensional (3D) nanofiber network of high quality graphene from chemical vapor deposition (CVD), through a simple ball-milling process. While high quality graphene network provided continuous and durable channels to enable efficient transport of lithium ions and electrons, the in-situ sulfur doping from the alloying effect of ball milling facilitated desirable affinity with entire sulfur species to prevent sulfur loss and highly active sites to propel sulfur redox reactions over cycling. This resulted in remarkable rate-performance and excellent cycling stability, together with large areal capacity at very high sulfur mass loading (Specific capacity over 666 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 C, and areal capacity above 5.2 mAh cm−2 at 0.2 C at sulfur loading of 8.0 mg cm−2 and electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 8 µL mg−1; and high reversible areal capacities of 13.1 mAh cm−2 at a sulfur load of 15 mg cm−2 and E/S of 5 µL mg−1).",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2020.01.033
Building MoSe2-Mo2C incorporated hollow fluorinated carbon fibers for Li-S batteries,"© 2020Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are severely confined by the sluggish redox kinetics and serious shuttle effect, and these disadvantages cause rapid capacity decay and low sulfur utilization efficiency. We fabricate the polar MoSe2, Mo2C coupled with F-doped carbon fibers (FC), named as MoSe2@FC@Mo2C to serve as the step multi-electrocatalysts to selectively catalyze the short chain soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion (Li2S4 ↔ Li2S) via the polar FC and the long chain LiPSs conversion (S8 ↔ Li2S4) via MoSe2 and Mo2C.

A monodispersed MnOx-CeO2 solid solution nanoparticles grown on reduced graphene oxide (MnOx-CeO2@rGO) is designed as effective electrocatalyst to facilitate the precipitation and conversion of Li2S. Alien Mn atoms doping modulates the electronic structure of CeO2 matrix and induces more oxygen vacancies, which facilitates the adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and boots the intrinsic catalytic activity for Li2S nucleation. Moreover, the monodispersity of ultra-small MnOx-CeO2 nanoparticles can provide enough active facets for sufficient Li2S precipitation. To reveal the electrocatalytic effect of MnOx-CeO2@rGO on Li2S precipitation, mesoporous SiO2@rGO nanosheets with numerous polar surface for strong LiPSs adsorption is adopt as a reference. The results of potentiostatic discharge deposition indicates that MnOx-CeO2@rGO reduces the overpotential for the rapid Li2S precipitation, avoiding the accumulation of LiPSs on the active sites. Such features offer the cell with MnOx-CeO2@rGO coated separator an excellent high rate capacity (630 mAh g−1 at 3C) and long-term cyclic stability (capacity fading of 0.036% per cycle at 1C for 1000 cycles).",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2019.123697
Mixed phase 2D Mo0.5W0.5S2alloy as a multi-functional electrocatalyst for a high-performance cathode in Li-S batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulfur batteries present unique polysulfide chemistry and exhibit a high theoretical energy density of 2600 W h kg-1. However, soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) tend to shuttle during battery cycling and corrode the Li anode; this leads to an eventual performance fading in the Li-S battery. This shuttle effect can be reduced by accelerating the conversion of dissolved polysulfides to insoluble LiPSs and back to sulfur. Herein, a novel 2D Mo0.5W0.5S2 alloy with a 2H (semiconducting)-1T (metallic) mixed-phase is synthesized on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by a two-step process of co-sputtering and sulfurization. The cathode comprising 2D Mo0.5W0.5S2-CNTs exhibits the synergistic effect of accelerated electron transfer, a higher LiPS binding effect, and good catalytic performance, as confirmed by our electrochemical analysis.

Electrodeposited Sulfur and CoxS Electrocatalyst on Buckypaper as High-Performance Cathode for Li–S Batteries,"© 2020, © 2020, The Author(s).Abstract: Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) are considered as the next generation of advanced rechargeable batteries because of their high energy density. In this study, sulfur and CoxS electrocatalyst are deposited on carbon nanotube buckypaper (S/CoxS/BP) by a facile electrodeposition method and are used as a binder-free high-performance cathode for LSBs. Elemental sulfur is deposited on buckypaper by electrooxidation of a polysulfide solution (~ S62−). This approach substantially increased the current and time efficiency of sulfur electrochemical deposition on conductive material for LSBs. S/CoxS/BP cathode could deliver an initial discharge capacity as high as 1650 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, which is close to the theoretical capacity of sulfur. At current rate of 0.5 C, the S/CoxS/BP has a capacity of 1420 mAh g−1 at the first cycle and 715 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles with a fading rate of 0.099% per cycle. The high capacity of S/CoxS/BP is attributed to both the homogeneous dispersion of nanosized sulfur within BP and the presence of CoxS catalyst. The sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) pretreatment of BP renders it polarity to bind polysulfides and thus facilitates the good dispersibility of nanosized sulfur within BP. CoxS catalyst accelerates the kinetics of polysulfide conversion and reduces the presence of polysulfide in the cathode, which suppresses the polysulfide diffusion to anode, i.e., the shuttle effect. The mitigation of the active material loss improves not only the capacity but also the cyclability of S/CoxS/BP.

Exclusive Licensee Science and Technology Review Publishing House. Distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0).The shuttle effect hinders the practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries due to the poor affinity between a substrate and Li polysulfides (LiPSs) and the sluggish transition of soluble LiPSs to insoluble Li2S or elemental S.

However, due to large ion-diffusion length, commercial sulfur suffers from low practical capacity. To achieve adequate capacity with long-term cyclability using the commercial sulfur-based cathodes, we introduce ultrathin lithium aluminate (LiAlO2) nanoflakes as polysulfide immobilizers with excellent Li+ ion conductivity. The ultrathin LiAlO2 nanoflake-inlaid sulfur cathode exhibits high areal capacity with extremely stable cycling performance. At a current rate of 0.2C, our cathode delivered a high areal capacity of 4.86 mA h cm-2 during the first cycle and retains 4.75 mA h cm-2 after 100 cycles. At a high current rate of 3C, the cathode retains the areal capacity of 2.52 mA h cm-2 after 500 cycles, with an extremely low capacity decay rate of 0.02% per cycle. In situ Raman spectroscopy studies coupled with the chronoamperometry technique reveal that LiAlO2 nanoflakes catalyze the redox kinetics in the Li-S batteries.

Atomically Engineered Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Liquid Polysulfide Adsorption and Their Effective Conversion in Li-S Batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Curtailing the polysulfide shuttle by anchoring the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS) within the electrode structure is essential to impede the rapid capacity fade in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. While most of the contemporary Li-S cathode surfaces are capable of entrapping certain LiPS, developing a unique electrode material that can adsorb all the intermediates of sulfur redox is imperative. Herein, we report doping of the MoS2 atomic structure with nickel (Ni@1TMoS2) to modulate its absorption capability toward all LiPS and function as an electrocatalyst for Li-S redox. Detailed in situ and ex situ spectroscopic analysis revealed that both Ni and Mo sites chemically anchor all the intermediate of LiPS. Electrochemical studies and detailed kinetics analysis suggested that the conversion of liquid LiPS to solid end products are facilitated on the Ni@1TMoS2 electrocatalytic surface. Further, the employment of the Ni@1TMoS2 electrocatalyst enhances the Li+ diffusion coefficient, thus contributing to the realization of a high capacity of 1107 mA h g-1 at 0.2C with a very limited capacity fade of 0.19% per cycle for over 100 cycles. In addition, this cathode demonstrated an excellent high rate and long cycling performance for over 300 cycles at a 1C rate.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c04281
Probing the interaction mechanism of heterostructured VOxNy nanoparticles supported in nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogel as an efficient polysulfide electrocatalyst for stable sulfur cathodes,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Reversible redox of sulfur to lithium sulfide through a series of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) still pose a key challenge to appreciate high-performance sulfur cathodes mainly because of shuttling phenomenon and sluggish kinetics. Herein, a simple novel synthetic approach has been presented to realize porous vanadium nitride oxide (VOxNy) nanoparticles spatially decorated within nitrogen doped reduced graphene aerogel (VONNG) via concurrent in-situ nitridation and carbonization processes. Nitrogen-doped reduced graphene aerogel enhances the physical retention and polar interaction of LiPS and contributes toward the overall conductivity of the matrix. Whereas, vanadium nitride oxide has exhibited a redox potential window intermediate to its oxides’ counterparts around which LiPS can form polythionate complexes to enhance the kinetics and LiPS retention by exploiting the V–N and V–O interfaces at cathode. The interaction mechanism has been probed through in-operando Raman spectroscopy, XPS and electroanalytical methods. The assembled cells from VONNG/S cathodes exhibit the initial discharge capacity of 1400 mAh g−1 at 0.05 C, 1250 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and maintained reversible capacity about 700 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C after 200 cycles.

Electrochemical Phase Evolution of Metal-Based Pre-Catalysts for High-Rate Polysulfide Conversion,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimIn situ evolution of electrocatalysts is of paramount importance in defining catalytic reactions. Catalysts for aprotic electrochemistry such as lithium–sulfur (Li-S) batteries are the cornerstone to enhance intrinsically sluggish reaction kinetics but the true active phases are often controversial. Herein, we reveal the electrochemical phase evolution of metal-based pre-catalysts (Co4N) in working Li-S batteries that renders highly active electrocatalysts (CoSx). Electrochemical cycling induces the transformation from single-crystalline Co4N to polycrystalline CoSx that are rich in active sites. This transformation propels all-phase polysulfide-involving reactions. Consequently, Co4N enables stable operation of high-rate (10 C, 16.7 mA cm−2) and electrolyte-starved (4.7 μL mgS−1) Li-S batteries. The general concept of electrochemically induced sulfurization is verified by thermodynamic energetics for most of low-valence metal compounds.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202003136

KGaA, WeinheimThe practical viability of Li–S cells depends on achieving high electrochemical utilization of sulfur under realistic conditions, such as high sulfur loading and low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio. Here, metallic 2D 1T′-ReS2 nanosheets in situ grown on 1D carbon nanotubes (ReS2@CNT) via a facile hydrothermal reaction are presented to efficiently suppress the “polysulfide shuttle” and promote lithium polysulfide (LiPS) redox reactions. The designed ReS2@CNT nanoarchitecture with high conductivity and rich nanoporosity not only facilitates electron transfer and ion diffusion, but also possesses abundant active sites providing high catalytic activity for efficient LiPS conversion. Li–S cells fabricated with ReS2@CNT exhibit high capacity with superior long-term cyclability with a capacity retention of 71.7% over 1000 cycles even at a high current density of 1C (1675 mA g−1).

High Volumetric Energy Density Sulfur Cathode with Heavy and Catalytic Metal Oxide Host for Lithium–Sulfur Battery,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimFor high-energy lithium–sulfur batteries, the poor volumetric energy density is a bottleneck as compared with lithium–ion batteries, due to the low density of both the sulfur active material and sulfur host. Herein, in order to enhance the volumetric energy density of sulfur cathode, a universal approach is proposed to fabricate a compact sulfur cathode with dense materials as sulfur host, instead of the old-fashioned lightweight carbon nanomaterials. Based on this strategy, heavy lanthanum strontium manganese oxide (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3), with a high theoretical density of up to 6.5 g cm−3, is introduced as sulfur host. Meanwhile, the La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 host also acts as an efficient electrocatalyst to accelerate the diffusion, adsorption, and redox dynamics of lithium polysulfides in the charge–discharge processes. As a result, such S/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode presents high gravimetric/volumetric capacity and outstanding cycling stability. Moreover, an ultra-high volumetric energy density of 2727 Wh L−1-cathode is achieved based on the densification effect with higher density (1.69 g cm−3), which is competitive to the Ni-rich oxide cathode (1800–2160 Wh L−1) of lithium–ion batteries. The current study opens up a path for constructing high volumetric capacity sulfur cathode with heavy and catalytic host toward practical applications of lithium–sulfur batteries.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.201903693
Enhanced performance and electrocatalytic kinetics on porous carbon-coated SnS microflowers as efficient Li–S battery cathodes,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdEffectively adsorbing and suppressing the polysulfide shuttle by polar materials are of great importance in lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries. Herein, the multifunctional SnS@C MS heterostructure consisting of porous carbon shell and SnS microflower-like core is prepared and demonstrated as an efficient Li–S battery cathode with electrocatalytic activity. The integrated physical confinement, strong chemical interaction, and rapid polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion kinetics are mutually promoted to facilitate a successive LiPSs adsorption-conversion with a significantly suppressed shuttle effect. Notably, systematic investigations and experiments reveal that the porous carbon layer can strongly entrap the LiPSs and subsequently facilitate its conversion kinetics between the liquid and solid phases. As a result, SnS@C/S MS cathode can deliver a high initial capacity of 1074.7 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and ultra-stable cycling performance with a slow capacity decay rate of 0.073% per cycle over 600 cycles at 0.5 C.

Cerium oxide embedded bilayer separator enabling fast polysulfide conversion for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as a promising candidate for next generation energy storage. However, the practical implementation of Li-S batteries is seriously hampered by the notorious shuttling of polysulfides. Current research mostly focuses on modifying polyolefin-based separators for immobilization of polysulfides. Herein we report a facile and efficient approach for fabrication of a functional bilayer separator based on 0D (nanocrystals)/1D (nanofibers) composite mats. The top layer comprises CeO2 nanocrystals spatially besieged by carbon nanofibers, serving as electrocatalysts to accelerate the reduction of polysulfides, meanwhile, acting as a dual-conductive upper current collector and a polysulfide inhibitor. The support layer maintains the structural integrity of the separator and allows the safe operation of Li-S batteries at high temperature. Consequently, the Li-S batteries with the bilayer separators exhibit a high initial reversible capacity of 1359 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C, high rate capability, superior cycling stability (with a capacity decay rate of 0.04% per cycle at 0.5 C over 300 cycles), and ultralow self-discharge.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2020.124120
Co9S8 Nanorods as an Electrocatalyst to Enhance Polysulfide Conversion and Alleviate Passivation in Li-S Batteries under Lean Electrolyte Conditions,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.As a result of the high theoretical energy density of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, they have been accepted as the next-generation energy storage system. Nevertheless, the current performance of Li-S batteries is still unsatisfactory under lean electrolyte conditions. It is because of sluggish deposition of Li2S2/Li2S passivating the sulfur/electrolyte interface, thus leading to lower sulfur use and bad rate performances of Li-S batteries. Herein, a novel Co9S8 nanorod-based catalytic interlayer placed between the cathode and separator is proposed. The interlayer possesses a three-dimensional open structure, which facilitates electrolyte infiltration but without trapping too much electrolyte. As a result, the electrocatalytic Co9S8 nanorods within the interlayer promote faster electrochemical kinetics and enhance the conversion of polysulfides, thus resulting in a higher specific discharge capacity and better rate and cycling performance. This work proves a feasible method in developing practical Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c03750
Molecular-Level Design of Pyrrhotite Electrocatalyst Decorated Hierarchical Porous Carbon Spheres as Nanoreactors for Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) are a class of new-generation rechargeable high-energy-density batteries. However, the persisting issue of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) dissolution and the shuttling effect that impedes the efficiency of LSBs are challenging to resolve. Herein a general synthesis of highly dispersed pyrrhotite Fe1−xS nanoparticles embedded in hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbon spheres (Fe1−xS-NC) is proposed. Fe1−xS-NC has a high specific surface area (627 m2 g−1), large pore volume (0.41 cm3 g−1), and enhanced adsorption and electrocatalytic transition toward LiPs. Furthermore, in situ generated large mesoporous pores within carbon spheres can accommodate high sulfur loading of up to 75%, and sustain volume variations during charge/discharge cycles as well as improve ionic/mass transfer. The exceptional adsorption properties of Fe1−xS-NC for LiPs are predicted theoretically and confirmed experimentally. Subsequently, the electrocatalytic activity of Fe1−xS-NC is thoroughly verified. The results confirm Fe1−xS-NC is a highly efficient nanoreactor for sulfur loading. Consequently, the Fe1−xS-NC nanoreactor performs extremely well as a cathodic material for LSBs, exhibiting a high initial capacity of 1070 mAh g−1 with nearly no capacity loss after 200 cycles at 0.5 C. Furthermore, the resulting LSBs display remarkably enhanced rate capability and cyclability even at a high sulfur loading of 8.14 mg cm−2.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202000651
Efficient Polysulfide Redox Enabled by Lattice-Distorted Ni3Fe Intermetallic Electrocatalyst-Modified Separator for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Exploring efficient electrocatalysts for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is of great significance for the sulfur/polysulfide/sulfide multiphase conversion. Herein, we report nickel-iron intermetallic (Ni3Fe) as a novel electrocatalyst to trigger the highly efficient polysulfide-involving surface reactions. The incorporation of iron into the cubic nickel phase can induce strong electronic interaction and lattice distortion, thereby activating the inferior Ni phase to catalytically active Ni3Fe phase. Kinetics investigations reveal that the Ni3Fe phase promotes the redox kinetics of the multiphase conversion of Li-S electrochemistry. As a result, the Li-S cells assembled with a 70 wt % sulfur cathode and a Ni3Fe-modified separator deliver initial capacities of 1310.3 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C and 598 mA h g-1 at 4 C with excellent rate capability and a long cycle life of 1000 cycles at 1 C with a low capacity fading rate of ∼0.034 per cycle. More impressively, the Ni3Fe-catalyzed cells exhibit outstanding performance even at harsh working conditions, such as high sulfur loading (7.7 mg cm-2) or lean electrolyte/sulfur ratio (∼6 μL mg-1).

One-Pot Fabrication of Crumpled N-Doped Graphene Anchored with Cobalt for High-Performance Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe commercialization of sulfur batteries is hindered by a few inherent drawbacks. In this study, crumpled N-doped graphene anchored with cobalt (Co-NCG) was fabricated in one pot via a sample solvothermal method and applied to lithium-sulfur (Li−S) batteries. The crumpled structure not only gives graphene a large specific surface area and abundant pores, but also endows graphene superb stability by preventing its restacking; these features are beneficial for loading and efficient utilization of sulfur. The lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom underwent strong chemical interactions with Li ions, which lent the Co-NCG/S material the ability to chemically immobilize polysulfide species. Cobalt acts as an electrocatalyst in the battery and kinetically accelerates sulfur redox reactions. As a result of these multifunctional arrangements, the Co-NCG/S cathode showed excellent capacity retention and reaction kinetics and high sulfur loading capacity.",ChemElectroChem,10.1002/celc.202000182
Rational design of porous nitrogen-doped Ti3C2 MXene as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for Li–S chemistry,"© 2020The detrimental shuttle effect and retarded sulfur reaction kinetics in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) chemistry mainly lead to inferior electrochemical performances, posing a fatal threat to the practical application of Li–S batteries. Herein, porous N-doped Ti3C2 MXene (P-NTC) has been realized by a scalable sacrificial templating route, resulting in the rational design of active electrocatalyst for Li–S chemistry. Benefiting from the superb electron conductivity, large surface area and strong interaction with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), P-NTC can trigger the surface-mediated redox reaction of LiPSs. Moreover, the homogenous nitrogen doping on Ti3C2 gives rise to enhanced interfacial interaction with Li atom and lowered dissociation barrier for Li2S. Therefore, the template-derived P-NTC not only acts as an effective LiPS immobilizer but also serves as a multifunctional electrocatalyst to propel the nucleation and decomposition of Li2S in discharge and charge processes, respectively. As expected, thus-fabricated S/P-NTC cathode maintains a low capacity decay of only 0.033% per cycle at 2.0 C over 1200 cycles. In further contexts, our ability to tune the sulfur mass loadings enables fabricated cathodes to harvest a high areal capacity of 9.0 mAh cm−2, holding great promise in future practical applications.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104555
Curbing polysulfide shuttling by synergistic engineering layer composed of supported Sn4P3 nanodots electrocatalyst in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdThe shuttle effect in lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries mainly originates from the diffusion of soluble polysulfides (LiPSs) and their depressed redox kinetics. Herein, we report a synergistic engineering layer composed of acorn shell porous carbon/Sn4P3 nanodots electrocatalyst (AS PC-Sn4P3). The synergistic engineering layer can not only serve as a conductive interface but also provide a dual-adsorption barrier to retain active material and inhibit the LiPSs migrating. More importantly, electrocatalytic Sn4P3 nanodots supported on acorn shell porous carbon (AS PC) within synergistic engineering layer effectively promote lithium ion diffusion, LiPSs conversion, Li2S2/Li2S deposition, and accelerate the electrochemical redox reaction and therefore curb the soluble LiPSs shutting behavior. As a result, enhanced Li–S battery performance is achieved with synergistic engineering layer, e.g., excellent cycling stability over 900 cycles at 1.0C with a low capacity decay of 0.046% per cycle, a good rate performance, and a high areal capacity of 8.7 mAh cm−2 under lean electrolyte conditions.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104532

Herein, the two-dimensional N-doped carbon nanosheets with appropriate distribution of micro/mesopores are proposed as a novel barrier to modify the commercial polypropylene separator, which significantly reduce the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides via physical confinement and chemical bonding and immobilize them as active materials within the cathode side. In addition, the efficient electrocatalysis of the functionalized carbon nanosheets on improving sulfur redox electrochemistry is revealed by systematic characterization, leading to rapid polysulfide conversion kinetics and uniform deposition of lithium sulfides. Due to the smooth trapping-adsorption-conversion process of polysulfides by applying the modified separator, the Li-S batteries with the simple carbon black/S cathodes exhibit outstanding lithium storage capacity (1338 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C) and satisfactory cycling stability (0.029% capacity decreasing per cycle over 700 cycles at 3 C). More importantly, a high reversible areal capacity of 4.3 mAh cm−2 could be maintained at high sulfur loading (5.8 mg cm−2), showing the striking commercial potential. These findings not only provide a feasible method to enhance electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries, but also open up a new sight on developing carbon nanomaterials as metal-free electrocatalysts for multistep reactions in battery electrochemistry.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2019.123840

In this work, we report the synthesis of trace iron-decorated nitrogen/sulfur co-doped hierarchically porous carbon through pyrolysis of a polymer network with impregnated silica nanoparticles, zinc acetate, and ferric nitrate, followed by the removal of templates and isolated iron particles. Both micropores and mesopores exist in the thus-synthesized materials with a specific surface area of 1055 m2 g-1. The synthesized electrocatalyst exhibits a promising electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reactions under both alkaline and acidic conditions as evidenced by half-wave potentials and limiting current density. The half-wave potential of the synthesized material is about 44 mV higher and about 60 mV lower than that of Pt/C under alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. Moreover, the synthesized material is more electrochemically stable than the commercial Pt/C under both alkaline and acidic conditions.

Nanosized FeS2 Particles Caged in the Hollow Carbon Shell as a Robust Polysulfide Adsorbent and Redox Mediator,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.As one of the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage technology, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery has been attracting increasing attention due to its high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mA h g-1), natural abundance, and environmental friendliness. However, the notorious shuttle effect caused by the soluble polysulfides as well as the sluggish redox kinetics significantly hinders the practical application. Herein, sulfiphilic iron disulfide (FeS2) nanoparticles caged in the hollow carbon shell have been facilely fabricated as the sulfur host (FeS2@C-S) for Li-S batteries. The deposited amorphous carbon cage with hollow space can provide efficient pathways for electrons, facilitate electrolyte penetration, and effectively accommodate the volume change during the repeated charge/discharge process. In addition, polar FeS2 nanoparticles have strong chemical interaction on the polysulfides and can promote the redox conversion of polysulfides as an electrocatalyst. Visible adsorption and electrochemical analysis have been conducted to confirm the static polysulfide trapping capability and dynamic polysulfide conversion reversibility. Synergistically, the FeS2@C-S cathode with a sulfur loading of ∼1.5 mg cm-2 exhibits high cycle stability with a reversible capacity of ca. 800 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.2 C and excellent rate performance. Even at the current density of 5 C, a capacity of ca. 400 mA h g-1 can still be achieved after 400 cycles.

A Freestanding Flexible Single-Atom Cobalt-Based Multifunctional Interlayer toward Reversible and Durable Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe development of Li-S batteries is greatly hindered by the polysulfide shuttling and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics, leading to low utilization of active materials and rapid capacity decay. Herein, a freestanding multifunctional interlayer, prepared by layer-by-layer assembling of the single-atom cobalt-anchored nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (NC@SA-Co) and dual network of carbon nanotube-cellulose nanofiber (CNT-CNF) hybrid, is proposed to effectively enhance the polysulfide immobilization and sulfur redox kinetics. The conductive CNT network acts as the physical barrier to confine the polysulfide diffusion and to facilitate the reuse of polysulfides. The oxygen-group-terminated CNF network allows the hopping of Li+ ion and suppresses the polysulfide crossover due to the strong electrostatic repulsion. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the 2D NC@SA-Co with numerous well-defined single sites of Co–N4 can effectively serve as an electrocatalyst to boost the reversible reaction of polysulfides. As a result, the assembled Li-S batteries with the multifunctional interlayer deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 1160 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and an ultralow capacity decay of 0.058% per cycle over 700 cycles.

The results show that PP@Pt battery delivers superior cycle performance and cycling stability than other batteries, confirming that the catalytic effect of Pt/C layer on the separator precede that of cathode doping. This is attributed to that the highly dispersed Pt/C layer is in intimate contact with the sulfur electrode to provide sufficiently active sites, which not only enhances the electronic conductivity but also provides a desired reaction site.",Ionics,10.1007/s11581-019-03299-5
"Naturally derived honeycomb-like N,S-codoped hierarchical porous carbon with MS2 (M = Co, Ni) decoration for high-performance Li-S battery","© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.Even though lithium-sulfur batteries have appealing advantages including a high theoretical capacity and energy density, their commercial implementation has been seriously hindered by some notorious reasons, particularly the severe shuttling effect, the insulating nature of sulfur, the large volumetric variation during cycling and the sluggish redox reaction kinetics. To tackle these issues, a biomass (ginkgo-nut) derived N,S-codoped porous carbon (GC) with an interconnected honeycomb-like hierarchical structure is synthesized by a templated carbonization method, followed by hydrothermal growth of transition metal sulfide MS2 (M = Co, Ni) nanocrystals, giving rise to a hybrid 3D electrocatalyst. The unique structure constructed by N,S-codoping can expose more active sites and polar surfaces to physically confine and chemically adsorb polysulfides. Meanwhile, the embedded MS2 polyhedral-like nanoparticles further enhance the interaction with polysulfides and improve conversion and redox kinetics of polysulfides. Remarkably, with 80 wt% sulfur loading (∼2.5 mg cm-2), GC-CoS2 exhibits a reversible capacity of 988.8 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.1 C and an excellent capacity of 610.3 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at 2 C, outperforming bare GC and GC-NiS2. Compared with the electrochemical performances of the representative reported biomass-derived sulfur host for Li-S batteries, evidently, both the discharge capacity and cycling stability of our GC-CoS2 sample are superior. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results suggest that CoS2 exhibits a higher binding energy towards lithium polysulfides and a lower energy barrier for Li+ diffusion on the surface compared to the NiS2 counterpart, suggesting that CoS2 is a better choice for lithium-sulfur batteries than NiS2. This work provides a new avenue to rationally design a carbonaceous catalyst host for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.",Nanoscale,10.1039/c9nr10419d

Recent research has shown that electrocatalysts such as Pt and CoS2 can catalyze the polysulfide redox reaction and hence improve the kinetics and cycle performance of Li-S batteries. The current work demonstrates that a cheaper, lightweight and green alternative, i.e., titanium-deficient anatase TiO2 (TDAT) not only possesses a strong lithium polysulfide (LiPS) trapping ability via chemical interactions but also catalyzes the sulfur-sulfide redox reaction. Moreover, the TDAT-PE separator also shows high lithium conductivity, fast lithium diffusion, and facile lithium transference. As a result, the Li-S batteries with the TDAT modified PE interlayer show markedly higher sulfur utilization and capacity, rate and cycle performances. An average capacity fading of only 0.025% per cycle is achieved during the 1000 cycle durability test.

Synergetic Effect of Nitrogen/Sulfur Dual-Doped Hierarchically Porous Carbon Networks for Li-S Batteries,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.The rapid specific capacity decay and poor cycle life of Li-S batteries (LSBs) can be attributed to serious shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfide between electrodes. Herein, nitrogen/sulfur dual-doped hierarchically porous carbon networks (NSC) with hierarchical pores and high N/S-doped content are constructed via a simple sol-gel route followed by two-step annealing under different atmospheres. The carbon networks are used as host materials and interlayers for LSBs to greatly improve the cycling and rate performances. The battery shows a superb incipient capacity (∼1000 mAh g-1) after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2 C. Remarkably, it retains a superior cycling performance for 500 cycles with large specific capacities of 647.1 and 393.6 mAh g-1 at high current densities of 2.0 and 5.0 C, respectively. Such satisfying electrochemical performances of NSC-based cells benefit from the synergetic effect of NSC materials, which not only immobilizes lithium polysulfides via strong interactions of Li-N and S-S, but also improves redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides to effectively suppress the shuttle effect. Accordingly, the reasonable design of NSC materials will be distinctly vital for promoting cycle performances of the LSBs and enhancing its practical applications.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b03864

Meanwhile, the interconnected 3D porous N-doped carbon architecture contributed to Li+ transportation, electrolyte infiltration and relieves volume expansion of sulfur. Thus, Li-S batteries configured with the S@Co/CoP@NC cathode exhibit a remarkable enhancement in the rate capability and cycling performances. When sulfur content is controlled to be 75.8 wt%, the S@Co/CoP@NC cathode delivers an outstanding high-rate capability up to 30 C and low capacity decay rates of 0.033% and 0.03% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C and 2 C, respectively.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2019.122595
Ultrathin bismuth nanosheets as an efficient polysulfide catalyst for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.Although many materials have sprung up as catalysts to improve polysulfide conversion in lithium-sulfur batteries, the catalytic mechanism is vague and a universal and efficient catalyst is still absent. Herein, we developed ultrathin polycrystalline bismuth (2D-Bi) nanosheets (thickness of ∼4 nm) as an electrocatalyst for polysulfide conversion. Such a 2D polycrystalline structure not only absorbs and immobilizes soluble polysulfides but also accelerates multistep polysulfide redox reactions, greatly inhibiting the polysulfide shuttling during charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, we gained an in-depth understanding of the distinctive electrocatalysis mechanism of 2D-Bi nanosheets by steady-state and dynamic electrochemical testing methods. The results showed that with the 2D-Bi electrocatalyst, the exchange current density (i0) and electron transfer number (n) (i0 > 3 mA cm-2, n = 6.6 at 2.1 V) were significantly enhanced. As a consequence, a 2D-Bi modified Li-S battery exhibited good electrochemical performance with high reversible capacity, stable cycle life and superb rate performance (retaining a capacity of 408 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 10C). Ultimately, a deep exploration and comprehension of the interior redox process as well as the conversion mechanism of sulfides provided a great avenue for accelerating the large-scale application of Li-S batteries in the near future.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta11079h
Electrochemical Phase Evolution of Metal-Based Pre-Catalysts for High-Rate Polysulfide Conversion,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.In situ evolution of electrocatalysts is of paramount importance in defining catalytic reactions. Catalysts for aprotic electrochemistry such as lithium–sulfur (Li-S) batteries are the cornerstone to enhance intrinsically sluggish reaction kinetics but the true active phases are often controversial. Herein, we reveal the electrochemical phase evolution of metal-based precatalysts (Co4N) in working Li-S batteries that renders highly active electrocatalysts (CoSx). Electrochemical cycling induces the transformation from single-crystalline Co4N to polycrystalline CoSx that are rich in active sites. This transformation propels all-phase polysulfide-involving reactions. Consequently, Co4N enables stable operation of high-rate (10 C, 16.7 mAcm-2) and electrolyte-starved (4.7 µLmg-1s Li-S batteries. The general concept of electrochemically induced sulfurization is verified by thermodynamic energetics for most of low-valence metal compounds.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/ANGE.202003136
Efficient Ni2Co4P3 Nanowires Catalysts Enhance Ultrahigh-Loading Lithium–Sulfur Conversion in a Microreactor-Like Battery,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimHigh-loading lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries suffer from poor electrochemical properties. Electrocatalysts can accelerate polysulfides conversion and suppress their migration to improve battery cyclability. However, catalysts for Li–S batteries usually lack a rational design. A d-band tuning strategy is reported by alloying cobalt to metal sites of Ni2P to enhance the interaction between polysulfides and catalysts. A molecular or atomic level analysis reveals that Ni2Co4P3 is able to weaken the SS bonds and lower the activation energy of polysulfides conversion, which is confirmed with temperature-dependent experiments. Ni2Co4P3 nanowires are further fabricated on a porous nickel scaffold to unfold the catalytic activity by its large surface area. Using a simple ion-selective filtration shell, a microreactor-like S cathode (MLSC) is constructed to realize ultrahigh S loading (25 mg cm−2). As such, a microreactor design integrates reaction and separation in one cell and can effectively address the polysulfide issues, the MLSC cell demonstrates excellent properties of cyclability and high capacity (1223 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C). More importantly, the catalyst's designs and microreactor strategies provide new approaches for addressing the complicated issues of Li–S batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.201906661
Cobalt atoms dispersed on hierarchical carbon nitride support as the cathode electrocatalyst for high-performance lithium-polysulfide batteries,"© 2019 Science China PressLithium-sulfur batteries are promising candidates for next-generation energy storage but are confronted with several challenges. One of the possible solutions is to design proper cathode electrocatalysts to accelerate the redox interconversion of solvated polysulfide intermediates. Herein, we report cobalt atoms dispersed on hierarchical carbon nitride support as an effective cathode electrocatalyst for lithium-polysulfide batteries. The electrocatalyst material is prepared from the simple reaction between melamine and cyanuric acid in the presence of Co2+, followed by the Ar annealing. The product has a unique hierarchical structure consisting of many thin and porous C3N4 nanosheets finely dispersed with Co atoms. The atomic dispersion of Co species is confirmed by X-ray absorption experiments. Electrochemical measurements reveal that it can promote the interconversion of polysulfides. As a result, batteries using this cathode electrocatalyst achieve large capacity (∼1400 mAh/g at 1.6 mA/cm2), good rate performance (∼800 mAh/g at 12.8 mA/cm2) and impressive cycling stability under different current densities and different sulfur loadings.",Science Bulletin,10.1016/j.scib.2019.08.016
Stepwise Electrocatalysis as a Strategy against Polysulfide Shuttling in Li-S Batteries,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Most issues with Li-S batteries are caused by the slowness of the multielectron sulfur electrochemical reaction resulting in the loss of sulfur as soluble polysulfides to the electrolyte and the redox shuttling of polysulfides between the cathode and anode during battery charge and discharge. The acceleration of the polysulfide conversion reaction to their end products via electrocatalysis has the appeal of a root-cause solution. However, the polysulfide electrocatalysts developed to date have rarely considered polysulfide conversion as a multistep reaction and, as such, were not optimized to target specific steps in the overall S8 ↔ Li2Sn ↔ Li2S conversion. The targeting approach is however beneficial, as it can be used to design multicatalyst systems to reduce as many rate-limiting steps in the overall catalysis as effectively possible. This article demonstrates the concept and implementation of stepwise electrocatalysis in polysulfide conversion, using Fe-N and Co-N co-doped carbons to selectively catalyze the long-chain polysulfide conversion (S8 ↔ Li2S4) and the short-chain polysulfide conversion reactions (Li2S4 ↔ Li2S), respectively. The two electrocatalysts were deployed in the sulfur cathode as a dual layer, using an ordered spatial separation to synergize their catalytic effects. A sulfur electrode designed as such could utilize ∼90% of the sulfur theoretical specific capacity and support a high areal capacity of ∼8.3 mAh cm-2 and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5 μL mg-1",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.9b07121
Molecular Trapping Strategy to Stabilize Subnanometric Pt Clusters for Highly Active Electrocatalysis,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Structure engineering is an effective way to substantially adjust the chemical and physical properties of materials. However, the effects of structure engineering of carbon hosts on the catalytic properties of Pt-based catalysts at the molecular scale are poorly understood. Herein, we report a molecular-level strategy to anchor and stabilize subnanometric Pt clusters on a covalently coupled host of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) for the development of electrocatalysts with high activities toward methanol oxidation reactions. Theoretical evaluation and experimental validation identified that the chemical integration of g-C3N4 on CNT is critical in optimizing the electronic structures and catalytic properties of Pt catalysts. As a result, the Pt-g-C3N4-CNT possesses a high energy level of d-band position, significantly strengthening its adsorption behaviors for the key reaction intermediates during the methanol electrooxidation process and energetically decreasing the energy barriers in the multistep reaction pathways. Combining with the strong catalyst-support interactions afforded by the adaptive coordination environment of g-C3N4 with Pt clusters as well as the unimpeded electron transfer via a σ-orbital overlap between CNTs and g-C3N4, the as-obtained Pt-g-C3N4-CNT possesses prodigious electrocatalytic properties including high activities, unusual poison tolerance, and reliable long-term discharge stabilities toward methanol oxidation reactions, in comparison to commercial Pt/activated carbon (Pt-AC) and Pt-CNT catalysts. This molecular-level finding opens up a new avenue to design and develop more efficient and effective carbon-based supports for fabricating advanced heterogeneous catalysts and could also be extended to more applications, such as lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, supercapacitors, and sensors.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.9b02987

Exceptional adsorption and catalysis effects of hollow polyhedra/carbon nanotube confined CoP nanoparticles superstructures for enhanced lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries with high theoretical energy density are promising next-generation green energy storage devices. However, the severe shuttling and depressed conversion of lithium polysulfides in sulfur cathode are two pivotal factors that limit the practical application of Li–S batteries. To solve these issues, rationally designed hollow polyhedra/carbon nanotube confined CoP nanoparticles superstructures (CoP@HPCN) for enhanced Li–S batteries are proposed here. With the high porosity and cavity, and multidirectional channels, hollow polyhedra/carbon nanotube architecture can effectively accommodate volume expansion and entrap sulfur species. More importantly, the experimental and theoretical results indicate that the uniformly inserted polar CoP nanoparticles as electrocatalyst not only significantly anchor polysulfides, but also catalyze the transformation of lithium polysulfides. Benefiting from these advantages, the CoP@HPCN based sulfur cathode can achieve good rate performance, impressive cycling stability, and ultralow self-discharge constant of 0.03% per day after resting for 60 days even at high sulfur loading of 3.7 mg cm−2.

Simultaneous Cobalt and Phosphorous Doping of MoS2 for Improved Catalytic Performance on Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe lithium–sulfur batteries are susceptible to the loss of sulfur as dissolved polysulfides in the electrolyte and their ensuing redox shutting effect. The acceleration of the conversion kinetics of dissolved polysulfides into the insoluble sulfur and lithium sulfide via electrocatalysis has the appeal of being a root-cause solution. MoS2 is the most common electrocatalyst used for this purpose. It is demonstrated that how the effectiveness can be improved by simultaneous cobalt and phosphorus doping of MoS2 nanotubes (P-Mo0.9Co0.1S2-2, containing 1.81 at% of P). Cobalt doping induces the transformation of MoS2 from 2H phase to metallic 1T phase, which improves the electrical conductivity of the MoS2. The Co–P coordinated sites on the catalyst surface are highly active for the polysulfide conversion reactions. Consequently, a sulfur cathode with P-Mo0.9Co0.1S2-2 can decrease the capacity fade rate from 0.28% per cycle before modification (over 150 cycles at 0.5C rate) to 0.046% per cycle after modification (over 600 cycles at 1C rate). P-Mo0.9Co0.1S2-2 also enhances the high rate performance from a capacity of 338 to 931 mAh g−1 at 6C rate. The results of this study provide the first direct evidence of the beneficial effects of heteroatom codoping of polysulfide conversion catalysts.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201902096

KGaA, WeinheimLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have been disclosed as one of the most promising energy storage systems. However, the low utilization of sulfur, the detrimental shuttling behavior of polysulfides, and the sluggish kinetics in electrochemical processes, severely impede their application. Herein, 3D hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets/molybdenum phosphide nanocrystal hollow nanospheres (MoP@C/N HCSs) are introduced to Li–S batteries via decorating commercial separators to inhibit polysulfides diffusion. It acts not only as a polysulfides immobilizer to provide strong physical trapping and chemical anchoring toward polysulfides, but also as an electrocatalyst to accelerate the kinetics of the polysulfides redox reaction, and to lower the Li2S nucleation/dissolution interfacial energy barrier and self-discharge capacity loss in working Li–S batteries, simultaneously. As a result, the Li–S batteries with MoP@C/N HCS-modified separators show superior rate capability (920 mAh g−1 at 2 C) and stable cycling life with only 0.04% capacity decay per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, the Li–S battery can achieve a high area capacity of 5.1 mAh cm−2 with satisfied capacity retention when the cathode loading reaches 5.5 mg cm−2.

Reliable and valid pyrite electrocatalysts supported on nitrogen-doped porous carbon sheets for advanced lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The binding and catalyzing of soluble polysulfide species to prevent their shuttles and accelerate the polysulfides conversion kinetics is essential to achieve lithium-sulfur batteries with high rate capability and superior cycling stability. Here, earth-abundant and eco-friendly pyrite FeS2 supported on N-doped porous carbon sheets is firstly demonstrated to act as a reliable adsorbent and active electrocatalyst towards polysulfide redox reaction with the aid of theoretical calculation and a series of fundamental experiments, which results in fast conversion kinetics of polysulfide. A detailed dissolution-capture-transformation mechanism is proposed on the tri-phase interface among pyrite FeS2, conductive N-doped porous carbon sheets and polysulfide species. On this tri-phase interface, the soluble polysulfide species can be chemically anchored and subsequently transform to Li2S efficiently catalyzed by pyrite FeS2, while the porous N-doped porous carbon sheets serve as highly conductive substrates for the nucleation of Li2S deposition. Consequently, the lithium-sulfur batteries with the composite cathodes exhibits excellent electrochemical rate capability (475 mAh g−1 at 5 C) and cycling stability (783 mAh g−1 after 160 cycles). The merits of low cost, eco-friendly feature combined with high activity towards polysulfides conversion reaction endows the pyrite FeS2 a promising electrocatalyst in realizing advanced lithium-sulfur batteries.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226778
Programmed Design of a Lithium–Sulfur Battery Cathode by Integrating Functional Units,"© 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSulfur is considered to be one of the most promising cathode materials due to its high theoretical specific capacity and low cost. However, the insulating nature of sulfur and notorious “shuttle effect” of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) lead to severe loss of active sulfur, poor redox kinetics, and rapid capacity fade. Herein, a hierarchical electrode design is proposed to address these issues synchronously, which integrates multiple building blocks with specialized functions into an ensemble to construct a self-supported versatile cathode for lithium–sulfur batteries. Nickel foam acts as a robust conductive scaffold. The heteroatom-doped host carbon with desired lithiophilicity and electronic conductivity serving as a reservoir for loading sulfur can trap LiPSs and promote electron transfer to interfacial adsorbed LiPSs and Ni3S2 sites. The sulfurized carbon nanofiber forest can facilitate the Li-ion and electron transport and retard the LiPSs diffusion as a barrier layer. Sulfiphilic Ni3S2 acts as both a chemical anchor with strong adsorption affinity to LiPSs and an efficient electrocatalyst for accelerating kinetics for redox conversion reactions. Synergistically, all functional units promote the lithium ion coupled electron transfer for binding and redox conversion of LiPSs, resulting in high reversible capacities, remarkable cycle stability, and excellent rate capability.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.201900711

Herein, a unique three-dimensional hierarchical microsphere architecture assembled by oxygen-deficient La(OH)3 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), as the sulfur host material for Li/S batteries, has been rationally designed using a facile spray-drying method for the first time. The robust microsphere architecture can reduce ion diffusion pathways and provide adequate space to modulate volume variation during cycling. It is noted that the abundant inner void spaces in the microspheres formed by rGO and oxygen-deficient La(OH)3 nanorod stacking provide physical adsorption for polysulfides. Meanwhile, the hydroxyl groups and defective sites on the surface of polar La(OH)3 nanorods provide strong chemical adsorption to lithium polysulfides, which was confirmed by density functional theory calculations.

However, complicated sulfur redox reactions and polysulfide shuttling significantly postpone the applications of lithium-sulfur batteries with rapid capacity decay and low Coulombic efficiency. Herein, a unique strategy of polysulfide electrocatalysis is proposed to improve the kinetics of the sulfur species and inhibit polysulfide shuttling in working lithium-sulfur batteries. Inspired by a natural biocatalyst and congener oxygen electrocatalysis, porphyrin was selected as the electrocatalytic active site, and framework porphyrin (POF) electrocatalysts were rationally designed, precisely fabricated, and demonstrated superior full-scheme electrocatalytic performance with regard to improving the kinetics for polysulfide conversion, Li2S nucleation, and dissolution of Li2S to polysulfides, simultaneously. Consequently, the lithium-sulfur batteries with POF electrocatalysts achieve high capacity of 1611 mAhg-1 at 0.1 C; outstanding stability with the capacity decay rate of 0.071% in 400 cycles, and satisfied performance with a high sulfur loading up to 4.3 mgcm-2. The strategy of polysulfide electrocatalysis develops our chemical understanding of sulfur species in energy-related applications and inspires the electrocatalysis concept for extended energy conversion and storage systems based on multielectron redox reactions.",CCS Chemistry,10.31635/ccschem.019.20180016
Advanced Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Based on Core-Shell MoS2/TiO2 Nanostructures in Acidic and Alkaline Media,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Hydrogen production as alternative energy source is still a challenge due to the lack of efficient and inexpensive catalysts, alternative to platinum. Thus, stable, earth abundant, and inexpensive catalysts are of prime need for hydrogen production via hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we present an efficient and stable electrocatalyst composed of earth abundant TiO2 nanorods decorated with molybdenum disulfide thin nanosheets, a few nanometers thick. We grew rutile TiO2 nanorods via the hydrothermal method on conducting glass substrate, and then we nucleated the molybdenum disulfide nanosheets as the top layer. This composite possesses excellent hydrogen evolution activity in both acidic and alkaline media at considerably low overpotentials (350 mV and 700 mV in acidic and alkaline media, respectively) and small Tafel slopes (48 and 60 mV/dec in acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively), which are better than several transition metal dichalcogenides, such as pure molybdenum disulfide and cobalt diselenide. A good stability in acidic and alkaline media is reported here for the new MoS2/TiO2 electrocatalyst. These results demonstrate the potential of composite electrocatalysts for HER based on earth abundant, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly materials, which can also be of interest for a broader range of scalable applications in renewable energies, such as lithium sulfur batteries, solar cells, and fuel cells.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.8b02119
Cobalt in Nitrogen-Doped Graphene as Single-Atom Catalyst for High-Sulfur Content Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Because of their high theoretical energy density and low cost, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are promising next-generation energy storage devices. The electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries largely depends on the efficient reversible conversion of Li polysulfides to Li2S in discharge and to elemental S during charging. Here, we report on our discovery that monodisperse cobalt atoms embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene (Co-N/G) can trigger the surface-mediated reaction of Li polysulfides. Using a combination of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first-principles calculation, we reveal that the Co-N-C coordination center serves as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to facilitate both the formation and the decomposition of Li2S in discharge and charge processes, respectively. The S@Co-N/G composite, with a high S mass ratio of 90 wt %, can deliver a gravimetric capacity of 1210 mAh g-1, and it exhibits an areal capacity of 5.1 mAh cm-2 with capacity fading rate of 0.029% per cycle over 100 cycles at 0.2 C at S loading of 6.0 mg cm-2 on the electrode disk.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.8b12973
Palladium nanocrystals-imbedded mesoporous hollow carbon spheres with enhanced electrochemical kinetics for high performance lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdLithium sulfur (Li-S) battery is one promising candidate for high energy density electrochemical energy storage system. Accelerating the sluggish reaction kinetics of sulfur cathode and suppressing the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle are crucial for the high-performance Li-S batteries. Herein, we prepared the catalytic palladium nano-particles (Pd NPs) imbedded in hollow carbon spheres (Pd@HCS) as sulfur host by a sacrificial template method. Benefitting from the hollow nanostructure and strong chemisorption ability of Pd NPs, Pd@HCS can effectively mitigate the LiPS shuttling via physical and chemical pathways. Furthermore, the Pd NPs as one electrocatalyst can accelerate the redox reaction kinetics of LiPS. The theoretical calculation and X-ray absorption spectroscopy elucidate that the moderate Pd-S bonding between Pd NPs and sulfur species are beneficial to LiPS conversion. The Pd@HCS/S electrode delivers a high initial capacity of 1306 mAh g−1 and 885 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, as well as the good cycling stability (a slight capacity decay of 0.068% per cycle over 400 cycles at 1 C). The Pd@HCS/S cathode with the high sulfur loading of 5.88 mg cm−2 delivers an initial capacity of 873 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and good capacity retention of 85% after 100 cycles.",Carbon,10.1016/j.carbon.2018.11.086
Cobalt-Doped SnS 2 with Dual Active Centers of Synergistic Absorption-Catalysis Effect for High-S Loading Li-S Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim The application of Li-S batteries is hindered by low sulfur utilization and rapid capacity decay originating from slow electrochemical kinetics of polysulfide transformation to Li 2 S at the second discharge plateau around 2.1 V and harsh shuttling effects for high-S-loading cathodes. Herein, a cobalt-doped SnS 2 anchored on N-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT@Co-SnS 2 ) substrate is rationally designed as both a polysulfide shield to mitigate the shuttling effects and an electrocatalyst to improve the interconversion kinetics from polysulfides to Li 2 S. As a result, high-S-loading cathodes are demonstrated to achieve good cycling stability with high sulfur utilization. It is shown that Co-doping plays an important role in realizing high initial capacity and good capacity retention for Li-S batteries. The S/NCNT@Co-SnS 2 cell (3 mg cm −2 sulfur loading) delivers a high initial specific capacity of 1337.1 mA h g −1 (excluding the Co-SnS 2 capacity contribution) and 1004.3 mA h g −1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 1.3 mA cm −2 , while the counterpart cell (S/NCNT@SnS 2 ) only shows an initial capacity of 1074.7 and 843 mA h g −1 at the 100th cycle. The synergy effect of polysulfide confinement and catalyzed polysulfide conversion provides an effective strategy in improving the electrochemical performance for high-sulfur-loading Li-S batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.201806724
Highly sulfiphilic Ni-Fe bimetallic oxide nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanotubes enable effective immobilization and conversion of polysulfides for stable lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdDeficiencies of sulfur cathode including polysulfide shuttling and poor redox kinetics severely limit cycling performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we have designed a binary host featuring highly sulfiphilic Ni-Fe bimetallic oxide (NiFe2O4) nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanotubes for Li-S batteries. NiFe2O4 nanoparticles provide highly sulfiphilic sites to confine lithium polysulfides by the formation of Li-O and S-O bonds, and act as an electrocatalyst to promote the conversion of polysulfides. The carbon nanotubes play an important synergistic role by providing efficient electron conduction pathways and preventing agglomeration of the catalyst. As a result, the sulfur cathode enables stable cycling with a very low capacity fade rate (∼0.029% per cycle upon 1000 cycles) at 1.0 C and a reversible capacity of ∼550 mAh g−1 at 5.0 C. Further, the superior cycling stability could be retained even for high sulfur loading of ∼5.0 mg cm−2. The development of such hybrid electrodes comprised of bimetallic oxides supported on carbon nanotubes could help realize long-lasting and stable Li–S batteries.",Carbon,10.1016/j.carbon.2018.10.035
Sulfur encapsulation by MOF-derived CoS2 embedded in carbon hosts for high-performance Li-S batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Li-S batteries have attracted great attention for their combined advantages of potentially high energy density and low cost. To tackle the capacity fade from polysulfide dissolution, we have developed a confinement approach by in situ encapsulating sulfur with a MOF-derived CoS2 in a carbon framework (S/Z-CoS2), which in turn was derived from a sulfur/ZIF-67 composite (S/ZIF-67) via heat treatment. The formation of CoS2 was confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and its microstructure and chemical composition were examined through cryogenic scanning/transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-S/TEM) imaging with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX). Quantitative EDX suggests that sulfur resides inside the cages, rather than externally. S/hollow ZIF-67-derived CoS2 (S/H-CoS2) was rationally designed to serve as a control material to explore the efficiency of such hollow structures. Cryo-STEM-EDX mapping indicates that the majority of sulfur in S/H-CoS2 stays outside of the host, despite its high void volumetric fraction of ∼85%. The S/Z-CoS2 composite exhibited highly improved battery performance, when compared to both S/ZIF-67 and S/H-CoS2, due to both the efficient physical confinement of sulfur inside the host and strong chemical interactions between CoS2 and sulfur/polysulfides. Electrochemical kinetics investigations revealed that the CoS2 could serve as an electrocatalyst to accelerate the redox reactions. The composite could provide an areal capacity of 2.2 mA h cm-2 after 150 cycles at 0.2C and 1.5 mA h cm-2 at 1C. This novel material provides valuable insights for further development of high-energy, high-rate and long-life Li-S batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta06947j
Synergistic electrocatalysis of polysulfides by a nanostructured VS4-carbon nanofiber functional separator for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The sluggish redox kinetic and the severe shuttle effect remain the key issues for the application of lithium-sulfur batteries, resulting in low sulfur utilization and rapid capacity fading. Herein, a nanostructured VS4 anchored on defect-rich carbon nanofibers (CNF-VS4) was coated on the commercial separator as both physical blocks to mitigate the shuttle effects and as an electrocatalyst to enhance the reaction kinetics of polysulfides/Li2S. Besides, polar nanostructured VS4 shows a high affinity to polysulfides, and conductive CNF network serves as ""second collector"" to trap and reutilize the active materials. The functional coating layer also provides rich defects for the dispersion and stabilization of Li2S. When the CNF-VS4 functional separator based on a high-sulfur content (80 wt%) cathode was applied in Li-S batteries, a high initial capacity of 1135 mA h g-1 at 0.2C and a superior rate capacity of 780 mA h g-1 at 2C were achieved. Even under a higher rate (5C), it still delivered a stable capacity of 300 mA h g-1 over 1000 cycles with a high coulombic efficiency of 95%.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta03516h
Freestanding 1T MoS 2 /graphene heterostructures as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for lithium polysulfides in Li-S batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry. A novel approach to effectively suppress the ""polysulfide shuttle"" in Li-S batteries is presented by designing a freestanding, three-dimensional graphene/1T MoS 2 (3DG/TM) heterostructure with highly efficient electrocatalysis properties for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The 3DG/TM heterostructure is constructed by few-layered graphene nanosheets sandwiched by hydrophilic, metallic, few-layered 1T MoS 2 nanosheets with abundant active sites. The porous 3D structure and the hydrophilic feature of 1T-MoS 2 are beneficial for electrolyte penetration and Li-ion transfer, and the high conductivities of both graphene and the 1T MoS 2 nanosheets facilitate electron transfer. These merits lead to a high electrocatalytic efficiency for LiPSs due to excellent ion/electron transfer and the presence of sufficient electrocatalytic active sites. Therefore, the cells with 3DG/TM exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance, with a high reversible discharge capacity of 1181 mA h g -1 and a capacity retention of 96.3% after 200 cycles. The electrocatalysis mechanism of LiPSs is further experimentally and theoretically revealed, which provides new insights and opportunities to develop advanced Li-S batteries with highly efficient electrocatalysts for LiPS conversion.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/c8ee03252a

Exceptional catalytic effects of black phosphorus quantum dots in shuttling-free lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2018, The Author(s).Lithium sulfur batteries with high energy densities are promising next-generation energy storage systems. However, shuttling and sluggish conversion of polysulfides to solid lithium sulfides limit the full utilization of active materials. Physical/chemical confinement is useful for anchoring polysulfides, but not effective for utilizing the blocked intermediates. Here, we employ black phosphorus quantum dots as electrocatalysts to overcome these issues. Both the experimental and theoretical results reveal that black phosphorus quantum dots effectively adsorb and catalyze polysulfide conversion. The activity is attributed to the numerous catalytically active sites on the edges of the quantum dots. In the presence of a small amount of black phosphorus quantum dots, the porous carbon/sulfur cathodes exhibit rapid reaction kinetics and no shuttling of polysulfides, enabling a low capacity fading rate (0.027% per cycle over 1000 cycles) and high areal capacities. Our findings demonstrate application of a metal-free quantum dot catalyst for high energy rechargeable batteries.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-018-06629-9

Elucidating the Catalytic Activity of Oxygen Deficiency in the Polysulfide Conversion Reactions of Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe accelerated conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides (the intermediate products in the charging and discharging of lithium–sulfur batteries) to insoluble sulfur and lithium sulfide is an effective method to suppress the “polysulfide shuttle” that is detrimental to the battery performance. The results of this study show that oxygen-deficient tungsten oxide (WO3− x) nanoplate is an effective bidirectional electrocatalyst for the polysulfide conversion reactions. Two different designs of asymmetric cells are used to elucidate the catalysis of the polysulfide conversion reactions and to confirm the role of oxygen deficiency on the conversion kinetics. The fast polysulfide conversion prevents the accumulation of polysulfides in the sulfur cathode and their ensuing loss to the electrolyte. Consequently, a sulfur cathode with WO3− x nanoplates is able to improve the cycle stability from a fade rate of 0.49% per cycle (over 100 cycles) to 0.13% per cycle (over 300 cycles) at the 0.5 C rate. In addition, the WO3− x nanoplates also improve the high rate performance of the sulfur cathode (at the 4 C rate) from a capacity of 444.1 to 693.2 mAh g−1. The results of this study provide the first direct experimental proof of the beneficial effects of oxygen deficiency in polysulfide conversion reactions.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201801868

However, the utilization of LSB suffered from the gap between the theoretical expectation and practical observation. Here, we propose the mechanistic origin of the electrocatalytic role of carbon in the N-doped graphene (NDG) layer placed on the entire cathode. We understand that the carbon in NDG acts as an electrocatalyst by interactions with polysulfide, leading to efficient electrochemical charge and discharge behaviors.

Synergistic Effect of Molecular-Type Electrocatalysts with Ultrahigh Pore Volume Carbon Microspheres for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are regarded as potential high-energy storage devices due to their outstanding energy density. However, the low electrical conductivity of sulfur, dissolution of the active material, and sluggish reaction kinetics cause poor cycle stability and rate performance. A variety of approaches have been attempted to resolve the above issues and achieve enhanced electrochemical performance. However, inexpensive multifunctional host materials which can accommodate large quantities of sulfur and exhibit high electrode density are not widely available, which hinders the commercialization of Li-S batteries. Herein, mesoporous carbon microspheres with ultrahigh pore volume are synthesized, followed by the incorporation of Fe-N-C molecular catalysts into the mesopores, which can act as sulfur hosts. The ultrahigh pore volume of the prepared host material can accommodate up to ∼87 wt % sulfur, while the uniformly controlled spherical morphology and particle size of the carbon microspheres enable high areal/volumetric capacity with high electrode density. Furthermore, the uniform distribution of Fe-N-C (only 0.33 wt %) enhances the redox kinetics of the conversion reaction of sulfur and efficiently captures the soluble intermediates. The resulting electrode with 5.2 mg sulfur per cm2 shows excellent cycle stability and 84% retention of the initial capacity even after 500 cycles at a 3 C rate.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.8b02258
Sulfur film sandwiched between few-layered MoS2 electrocatalysts and conductive reduced graphene oxide as a robust cathode for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Improving the capacity retention and reaction kinetics of sulfur cathodes is critical to realizing high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. In this contribution, few-layered MoS2 nanosheets as electrocatalysts are introduced into the Li-S system by developing a novel sandwich-type MoS2/sulfur/reduced graphene oxide (MoS2/S/rGO) composite cathode. The sandwiched sulfur film has a synergistic coupling effect with both the MoS2 electrocatalyst layer and the conductive rGO substrate, enabling a robust hybrid structure with strong interfacial interactions for physical entrapment of intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) during cycling. More importantly, the MoS2 electrocatalysts are bifunctional in regulating sulfur reaction chemistry, and could chemically immobilize LiPSs via Li-S bonds and also kinetically accelerate sulfur redox reactions, especially for the mutual conversions between soluble LiPSs and solid Li2S2/Li2S. These merits with regard to structure and chemistry enable the MoS2/S/rGO cathode with superior rate capability (reversible capacities of 657 and 553 mA h g-1 at high rates of 7 and 10C, respectively), and long-term cycling stability (a slow capacity decay of 0.037% per cycle at 2C over 1000 cycles).

"Understanding the anchoring effect of Graphene, BN, C 2 N and C 3 N 4 monolayers for lithium−polysulfides in Li−S batteries","© 2017 Elsevier B.V. Recently, Li−S batteries with a high theoretical specific energy have attracted significant attention. However, their practical application is still seriously hindered by the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in the Li−S batteries system. Introducing anchoring materials into the cathode or separator, which can strongly attract LiPSs because of advisable binding energies, has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to alleviate the shuttling effect for achieving the excellent cycling performance of Li−S batteries. In this work, the complete mechanistic understanding of the interaction between non-metallic monolayer materials (N-MMLMs, including Graphene, BN, C 2 N and C 3 N 4 ) and LiPSs is given in detail with the aid of density functional theory. The calculation results show that N-MMLM can combine the chemical interaction and the physical entrapment of sulfur species to suppress the shuttling effect. C 3 N 4 and C 2 N are predicted to trap LiPSs via stronger interfacial interaction and alleviate the interactions between LiPSs and solvents as well as the consequent dissolution. The strong anchoring effect of C 3 N 4 /C 2 N comes from the bonding of Li−N/C−S and charge transfer. Further charge transfer study reveals that the C 3 N 4 /C 2 N can serve as an electrocatalyst, which effectively accelerates the kinetics of LiPSs redox reactions.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.10.230
Accelerated polysulfide redox kinetics revealed by ternary sandwich-type S@Co/N-doped carbon nanosheet for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdLithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries show significant advantages for next-generation energy storage systems due to the high theoretical energy density and cost effectiveness. The main challenge for developing long-life and high-performance Li-S batteries is to simultaneously restrain the shuttle of soluble polysulfides while accelerating the redox kinetics of sulfur-related species during cell operation. Herein, a sandwich-type sulfur@Co/N-doped carbon (S@Co-NC) ternary composite is synthesized, combining in a simple way the advantages of synergetic physical and chemical confinement on sulfur-related species.

KGaA, Weinheim.Designing an optimum cell configuration that can deliver high capacity, fast charge–discharge capability, and good cycle retention is imperative for developing a high-performance lithium–sulfur battery. Herein, a novel lithium–sulfur cell design is proposed, which consists of sulfur and magnesium–aluminum-layered double hydroxides (MgAl-LDH)–carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite cathode with a modified polymer separator produced by dual side coating approaches (one side: graphene and the other side: aluminum oxides). The composite cathode functions as a combined electrocatalyst and polysulfide scavenger, greatly improving the reaction kinetics and stabilizing the Coulombic efficiency upon cycling. The modified separator enhances further Li+-ion or electron transport and prevents undesirable contact between the cathode and dendritic lithium on the anode.

Enhanced polysulfide redox kinetics electro-catalyzed by cobalt phthalocyanine for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Controlling the intrinsic polysulfide shuttle is the key to enhance the reaction kinetics and cycling stability of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, active transition-metal phthalocyanine compounds are firstly adopted as the electrocatalysts for sulfur cathodes and proved to enhance the cycling stability. Systematic investigations specifically for cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) suggest that the inclusion of CoPc can inhibit the self-discharge behavior and improve the exchange current density of sulfur cathodes effectively. Benefiting from the strong adsorption capability toward soluble polysulfide species, favorable guidance for the formation of Li2S2/Li2S and efficient catalytic transformation of the deposits in the subsequent charging process, the sulfur electrodes containing 3.8 wt% CoPc deliver a specific capacity of 719.6 mA h g-1 after 400 cycles at 0.2C, 80% higher than those of the pristine ones.

Active Platinum Nanoparticles as a Bifunctional Promoter for Lithium−Sulfur Batteries,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAs a widely used electrocatalyst in fuel cells, metallic platinum has achieved great success in terms of kinetic promotion. Still plagued by a familiar problem, owing to the sluggish kinetics of irreversible Li2S2/Li2S species deposition, lithium−sulfur batteries with high theoretical energy are far from being realized. Inspired by the similarity between oxygen and sulfur, being in the same group, commercially available Pt/C was investigated here to explore the possible effect on the sulfur cathode. The electrochemical tests show that the electrode with 2 wt% Pt added delivers a 61 % enhancement in the discharging specific capacity compared to the control electrode after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, along with an average coulombic efficiency of 98.3 %. It is proven that these beneficial results can be attributed to the favorable capability of polysulfide immobilization and effective inhibition of self-discharging behavior. The ex situ XPS analysis and the increased exchange current density further reveal that the involved platinum nanoparticles could not only function as a static chemical absorber for polysulfide species, but, more importantly, to promote the redox kinetic effectively as an electrochemical catalyst. The positive effect of utilizing commercial Pt/C materials directly on sulfur cathodes is of great significance in developing sulfur cathodes for Li/S batteries.",ChemElectroChem,10.1002/celc.201700533
From Carbon-Based Nanotubes to Nanocages for Advanced Energy Conversion and Storage,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Conspectus Carbon-based nanomaterials have been the focus of research interests in the past 30 years due to their abundant microstructures and morphologies, excellent properties, and wide potential applications, as landmarked by 0D fullerene, 1D nanotubes, and 2D graphene. With the availability of high specific surface area (SSA), well-balanced pore distribution, high conductivity, and tunable wettability, carbon-based nanomaterials are highly expected as advanced materials for energy conversion and storage to meet the increasing demands for clean and renewable energies. In this context, attention is usually attracted by the star material of graphene in recent years. In this Account, we overview our studies on carbon-based nanotubes to nanocages for energy conversion and storage, including their synthesis, performances, and related mechanisms. The two carbon nanostructures have the common features of interior cavity, high conductivity, and easy doping but much different SSAs and pore distributions, leading to different performances. We demonstrated a six-membered-ring-based growth mechanism of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with benzene precursor based on the structural similarity of the benzene ring to the building unit of CNTs. By this mechanism, nitrogen-doped CNTs (NCNTs) with homogeneous N distribution and predominant pyridinic N were obtained with pyridine precursor, providing a new kind of support for convenient surface functionalization via N-participation. Accordingly, various transition-metal nanoparticles were directly immobilized onto NCNTs without premodification. The so-constructed catalysts featured high dispersion, narrow size distribution and tunable composition, which presented superior catalytic performances for energy conversions, for example, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and methanol oxidation in fuel cells. With the advent of the new field of carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts, we first extended ORR catalysts from the electron-rich N-doped to the electron-deficient B-doped sp2 carbon. The combined experimental and theoretical study indicated the ORR activity originated from the activation of carbon π electrons by breaking the integrity of π conjugation, despite the electron-rich or electron-deficient nature of the dopants. With this understanding, metal-free electrocatalysts were further extended to the dopant-free defective carbon nanomaterials. Moreover, we developed novel 3D hierarchical carbon-based nanocages by the in situ MgO template method, which featured coexisting micro-meso-macropores and much larger SSA than the nanotubes. The unique 3D architecture avoids the restacking generally faced by 2D graphene due to the intrinsic π-π interaction. Consequently, the hierarchical nanocages presented superior performances not only as new catalyst supports and metal-free electrocatalysts but also as electrode materials for energy storage. State-of-the-art supercapacitive performances were achieved with high energy density and power density, as well as excellent rate capability and cycling stability.

These results not only provide unique carbon-based nanomaterials but also lead to in-depth understanding of growth mechanisms, material design, and structure-performance relationships, which is significant to promote their energy applications and also to enrich the exciting field of carbon-based nanomaterials.",Accounts of Chemical Research,10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00541
3D hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanoflower derived from chitosan for efficient electrocatalytic oxygen reduction and high performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Despite diverse carbon materials being intensively applied in energy storage and conversion, efficient optimization of the carbon structure to further improve its performance is still a great challenge. Herein, we design and fabricate a highly uniform 3D hierarchical N-doped carbon nanoflower (NCNF) using low-cost chitosan as the nitrogen and carbon source by a silica template method. The as-prepared NCNF with abundant meso-porous channels displays a high surface area (907 m2 g-1) and large pore volume (1.85 cm3 g-1), thereby demonstrating high performance as a bifunctional material for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and in lithium-sulfur batteries. As a metal-free ORR electrocatalyst, the NCNF exhibits excellent electrochemical activity comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%), and much better methanol tolerance and durability. As sulfur accommodation for a Li-S battery cathode, the NCNF high loading content of sulfur (80 wt%) achieves an extremely high capacity (1633 mA h g-1 at 0.2C), excellent rate capability (916 mA h g-1 at 5C) and good cycling performance with a capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1C. Even when the area density is improved to 4.5 mgsulfur cm-2, the battery delivers a high areal capacity of ∼5.5 mA h cm-2 (0.37 mA cm-2) and still maintains ∼3 mA h cm-2 after 200 cycles with a smaller capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle at a high area current density of 3.77 mA cm-2. Significantly, the carbon materials recycled from the Li-S cathode after 500 cycles are reused as ORR electrocatalysts, displaying more excellent electrocatalytic activity than Pt/C (20 wt%).",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c7ta04728b
Effect of nickel coated multi-walled carbon nanotubes on electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur rechargeable batteries,"© 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.Conventional lithium-sulfur batteries suffer from severe capacity fade, which is induced by low electron conductivity and high dissolution of intermediated polysulfides. Recent studies have shown the metal (Pt, Au, Ni) as electrocatalyst of lithium polysulfides and improved the performance for lithium sulfur batteries. In this work, we present the nickel coated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Ni-MWNTs) as additive materials for elemental sulfur positive electrodes for lithium-sulfur rechargeable batteries. Compared with MWNTs, the obtained Ni-MWNTs/sulfur composite cathode demonstrate a reversible specific capacity approaching 545 mAh after 200 cycles at a rate of 0.5C as well as improved cycling stability and excellent rate capacity. The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the fact the MWNTs shows a vital role on polysulfides adsorption and nickel has a catalytic effect on the redox reactions during charge-discharge process. Meanwhile, the Ni-MWNTs is a good electric conductor for sulfur cathode.",Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology,10.1166/jnn.2017.13907
An integrated electrode/separator with nitrogen and nickel functionalized carbon hybrids for advanced lithium/polysulfide batteries,"© 2016 Elsevier LtdLithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are one of the most promising next-generation secondary battery systems for meeting increasing energy storage demands due to their high theoretical energy density. However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is hindered by the low electrical conductivity of sulfur and the severe polysulfide shuttling problem. Here, we report the easy synthesis of a nitrogen-doped multi-functional nanocarbon hybrid decorated with nickel nanoparticles and its use in a conductive membrane for an integrated electrode/separator in Li/dissolved polysulfide batteries. The nitrogen-doping produces desirable polysulfide immobilization by enhanced adsorption and chemical bonding. The nickel nanoparticles act as electrocatalysts to accelerate the kinetics of sulfur conversion reactions. The assembled conductive membrane acts both as a conductive scaffold and a polysulfide adsorption layer that allows efficient charge transfer and effectively prevents polysulfide diffusion. Consequently, a Li/polysulfide cell with a high sulfur loading demonstrates excellent cycling stability with a low capacity decay rate of 0.115% per cycle over 200 cycles, showing great promise for use in advanced Li–S batteries.",Carbon,10.1016/j.carbon.2016.08.050
Kinetically-enhanced polysulfide redox reactions by Nb2O5 nanocrystals for high-rate lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.To combat the shuttle of soluble polysulfides, physical confinement approaches aiming to trap sulfur within porous hosts have been pursued, but their success in terms of capacity decay and kinetic sluggishness is still limited. Herein, we update the confinement approach by integrating ultra-fine Nb2O5 nanocrystals onto a well-developed mesoporous carbon framework, which could primitively combine the advantages of the physical entrapment and the chemical interaction of sulfur species. An electrochemical kinetic study further reveals that the Nb2O5 nanocrystals could serve as an electrocatalyst, significantly accelerating the kinetics of polysulfide redox reactions, especially for the reduction of soluble Li2S6/Li2S4 to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S. By overcoming the kinetic barriers of the redox reactions, the resulting mesoporous carbon microspheres/Nb2O5/S composites have a much improved electrochemical performance in terms of lower polarization, higher Coulombic efficiency, and much improved rate capability. They could deliver a high initial capacity of 1289 mA h g-1 at 0.5C with a reversible capacity of 913 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles. And more importantly, the ternary cathodes demonstrate an unprecedented rate capability with 887 mA h g-1 at 5C, and a reversible capacity of 650 mA h g-1 at 2C after 500 cycles. The concept of accelerating the kinetics of polysulfide redox reactions will pave the way for future development of high-rate and long-cycle Li-S batteries.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/c6ee01662f
Effects of Nickel Particle Size and Graphene Support on the Electrochemical Performance of Lithium/Dissolved Polysulfide Batteries,"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.The electrocatalytic effect of nickel (Ni) nanoparticle sizes on the lithium polysulfide conversion reactions in dissolved lithium sulfur battery configuration is investigated. The Ni particles of 20 nm with the higher cathode surface area show a superior capacity of 1066 mAh g-1 sulfur compared to Ni particles of 40 and 100 nm for the first cycle. In addition, to further improve the capacity retention and discharge capacity of the cell, the effect of the graphene support on Ni nanoparticle dispersion and cycling performance is investigated. The results show a significant improvement in the discharge capacity compared to the other electrodes. This could be explained by the homogeneous distribution of Ni nanoparticle within the carbon matrix, which suppress the agglomeration and surface area loss of the Ni nanoparticle after cycling; as well as a synergetic effect of graphene structure and Ni nanoparticle.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.10.061
Electrocatalytic Polysulfide Traps for Controlling Redox Shuttle Process of Li-S Batteries,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.Stabilizing the polysulfide shuttle while ensuring high sulfur loading holds the key to realizing high theoretical energy of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we present an electrocatalysis approach to demonstrate preferential adsorption of a soluble polysulfide species, formed during discharge process, toward the catalyst anchored sites of graphene and their efficient transformation to long-chain polysulfides in the subsequent redox process. Uniform dispersion of catalyst nanoparticles on graphene layers has shown a 40% enhancement in the specific capacity over pristine graphene and stability over 100 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.3% at a current rate of 0.2 C. Interaction between electrocatalyst and polysulfides has been evaluated by conducting X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron microscopy studies at various electrochemical conditions.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.5b04472
Nickel fibers/sulfur composites cathode with enhanced electrochemical performance for rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.The commercialization of lithium sulfur batteries have so far hindered by the low electrochemical utilization and rapid capacity fading of sulfur cathode, which is induced by low electron conductivity and high dissolution of intermediate polysulfides. Recent studies have shown that the metal (Pt, Au, Ni) as electrocatalyst of lithium polysulfides and its metallic porous nanostructure can suppress the shuttle effect. In this work, we use the porous nanostructure of nickel fibers/sulfur as-designed composite cathode material for lithium sulfur batteries. The initial discharge capacity of the cathode with the added 3(%) nickel fibers was 805 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>, and the remaining capacity was 440 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> after 50 cycles at 0.766 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Even at a high current density of 1.532 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, it also kept a high discharge capacity of 310 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>. Compared with pure sulfur electrodes, the electrodes containing nickel fibers showed an obviously improved cycle and rate performances, confirming that metallic porous nanostructure of nickel can not only contribute to reducing the dissolution of polysulfides into electrolytes, but also has a catalytic effect on the redox reactions during charge-discharge process.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.06.157
Sulfur-doped graphene derived from cycled lithium-sulfur batteries as a metal-free electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Heteroatom-doped carbon materials have been extensively investigated as metal-free electrocatalysts to replace commercial Pt/C catalysts in oxygen reduction reactions in fuel cells and Li-air batteries. However, the synthesis of such materials usually involves high temperature or complicated equipment. Graphene-based sulfur composites have been recently developed to prolong the cycling life of Li-S batteries, one of the most attractive energy-storage devices. Given the high cost of graphene, there is significant demand to recycle and reuse graphene from Li-S batteries. Herein, we report a green and cost-effective method to prepare sulfur-doped graphene, achieved by the continuous charge/discharge cycling of graphene-sulfur composites in Li-S batteries. This material was used as a metal-free electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction and shows better electrocatalytic activity than pristine graphene and better methanol tolerance durability than Pt/C.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201410258
