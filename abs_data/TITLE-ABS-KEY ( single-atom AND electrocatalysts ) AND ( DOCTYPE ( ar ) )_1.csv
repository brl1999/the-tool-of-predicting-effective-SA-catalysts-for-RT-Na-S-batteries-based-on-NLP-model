Electrochemical removal of ammonium nitrogen in high efficiency and N2 selectivity using non-noble single-atomic iron catalyst,"© 2022Ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, especially in offshore aquaculture systems. Electrochemical oxidation is very promising to remove NH4+-N, but suffers from the use of precious metals anodes. In this work, a robust and cheap electrocatalyst, iron single-atoms distributed in nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe-SAs/N-C), was developed for electrochemical removal of NH4+-N from in wastewater containing chloride. The Fe-SAs/N-C catalyst exhibited superior activity than that of iron nanoparticles loaded carbon (Fe-NPs/N-C), unmodified carbon and conventional Ti/IrO2-TiO2-RuO2 electrodes. And high removal efficiency (> 99%) could be achieved as well as high N2 selectivity (99.5%) at low current density. Further experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the indispensable role of single-atom iron in the promoted generation of chloride derived species for efficient removal of NH4+-N. This study provides promising inexpensive catalysts for NH4+-N removal in aquaculture wastewater.",Journal of Environmental Sciences (China),10.1016/j.jes.2022.03.004
Ru monolayer island doped MoS2 catalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing highly-efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts is significantly important for hydrogen generation by water splitting. In this work, Ru monolayer islands (MIs)-doped MoS2 catalysts are synthesized controllably by high-gravity technology. Ru MIs are successfully anchored on the MoS2 nanosheets via the coordination of Ru and S species in the MoS2 matrix to form monolayer island structure, which not only provides high-density active centers for boosting the HER activity, but also exhibits the maximum atomic utilization. The prepared Ru MIs-doped MoS2 catalysts exhibit a remarkably low overpotential of 17 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10) in alkaline conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) results reveal that multi-Ru monolayer doping can efficiently tailor the electronic structure and improve the adsorption of hydrogen on MoS2, and thereby boost the catalytic activity of HER. This work provides a Ru MIs doping approach to enhance the density of active sites of electrocatalysts, which would overcome the bottleneck of low active site density of single-atom catalysts to design high-efficient electrocatalysts with maximum atomic utilization.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.139803
Sulfur-induced electron redistribution of single molybdenum atoms promotes nitrogen electroreduction to ammonia,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is considered a sustainable approach that endows NH3 production from N2 and H2O under ambient conditions. Due to the sluggish adsorption/activation of N2 and the strong competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction, advanced NRR electrocatalysts with both high activity and selectivity are required. Herein, we demonstrate a local modulation strategy that simultaneously promotes NRR selectivity and activity on molybdenum-based single atom catalysts (SACs) by sulfur-induced electronic redistribution, delivering a NH3 yield rate of 46.6 μg·h−1·mgcat−1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 28.9% at a potential of − 0.2 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M HCl under ambient conditions. This study provides a promising strategy for synergizing the selectivity and activity of electrocatalysts toward multistep NRR. Moreover, such an atomic-level engineering strategy should be applicable to other SACs in general and may have a major impact on their use in electrocatalytic applications.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.122038
Structure-Activity Relationship of Atomic-Scale Cobalt-Based N-C Catalysts in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction,"© Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.Understanding the origin of the active site activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is key for developing efficient electrocatalysts. However, crucial challenges remain due to the complexity of catalyst structure-activity relationships. Herein, various Co-N-C configurations, including single atoms, diatoms, and clusters, were designed to establish structure-activity relationships by first-principles calculations. It was revealed that the Co-N4 exhibited the best reactivity due to the high coordination number of the metal center and moderate adsorption energies for all reaction intermediates. The diatom and cluster activities originate from the highly coordinated structures formed with reaction intermediates, which serve as coordination ligands. Furthermore, other factors influencing the OER activity based on the Co-N4 configuration are discussed. For example, the weak metal-metal interaction can further optimize the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates by tuning antibonding energy levels of Co-O. Subsequently, an ultralow overpotential of 0.23 V for the OER in CoNi-type4 systems can be obtained by extrapolation of the volcano plot derived from the established structure-adsorption-activity relationships. This work uncovers the underlying OER activity mechanisms of Co-N-C catalysts, which helps to further understanding of high-performance of M-N-C base catalysts and will aid in the future design of high-efficiency OER catalysts.",Wuli Huaxue Xuebao/ Acta Physico - Chimica Sinica,10.3866/PKU.WHXB202207007
Metal-organic framework derived Fe3C nanoparticles coupled single-atomic iron for boosting oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Developing transition metal electrocatalysts, especially single-atom catalysts (SACs), is significant. However, most of the synthesis procedures of SACs involve the formation of nanoparticles (NPs), and the produced NPs always play an influential role during electrocatalytic processing, so exploring the synergistic effects between metallic and isolated metal species is of great interest. Herein, we report a Zn/Fe-metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived Fe3C coupling FeNx catalyst constructed via coordination confinement pyrolysis effect successfully. Compared with the Pt/C catalyst and most precious metal-free catalysts, the optimized catalyst Fe3C-FeNx/NC-7 demonstrates superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in 0.1 M KOH. The half-wave potential (E1/2) reaches up to 0.93 V with the limiting current density (jL) of 5.65 mA/cm2 at 5 mV/s scanning rate and 1600 rpm. The excellent performance originates from the synergistic effect of FeNx and Fe3C active units combined with wide-distributed nitrogen atoms. The Fe3C NPs further optimize the electronic structure and adsorption/desorption free energy of the catalyst. The assembled primary Zn-air battery (ZAB) displays a satisfying open-circuit potential of 1.53 V and an excellent specific capacity of 835 mA·h·g−1. The maximum power density achieves 283 mW/cm2, outclassing the commercial Pt/C-based ZAB. This result demonstrates the promising application prospect of the catalyst-cooperated metallic NPs with isolated single metal species.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2022.10.036
Zn single atom on N-doped carbon: Highly active and selective catalyst for electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3−) to ammonia (NH3) in aqueous media is a double-advantage process, which can convert the main pollutant in water to the most useful chemical feedstocks. However, the design and development of highly effective and selective catalyst for NO3− reduction reaction (NO3−RR) is still challenging currently, as the NO3−RR contains multiple pathways and suppresses each other. Here, we demonstrate a highly active and selective Zn single atom supported microporous N-doped carbon catalyst, which was characterized by the atomic resolution high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy, achieving excellent NO3−RR performance (NO3− conversion: 97.2 %; NH3 selectivity: 94.9 %; NH3 yield rate: ∼39,000 μg h−1 mgcat.−1; Faradaic efficiency: 94.8 %). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the atomically dispersed Zn atom coordinated with four N atoms has moderate interaction with NO3− species due to its positive charge. The reaction mechanism and potential determining step for NO3−RR on single Zn atom were further determined. This research provides an exciting new way for the rational design and development of single atom catalyst for advanced electrochemical applications.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.139533
Regulating d-orbital electronic character and HER free energy of VN electrocatalyst by anchoring single atom,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Too strong or too weak orbital electron-coupling with active adsorbents basically results in unsatisfied free energies, and consequently limiting the HER kinetics and activity. Herein, Co-VN catalyst is fabricated to highlight that atomically implanted Co into VN can regulate its d orbital electronic character and corresponding free energy for further improving its alkaline HER performances. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal that atomically implanted Co into VN could induce local charge redispersion to further downshift the d band center position of V-3d in Co-VN. The lowered d band center of the V-3d could not only decrease the d orbital electron-coupling between V site and O atom of OH intermediate to boost desorption of OH species and H2O dissociation kinetics, but also simultaneously balance the hydrogen adsorption free energy to facilitate the desorption of as-formed H2, both of which synergistically increase the Volmer and Heyrovsky kinetics and overall HER activity of Co-VN. Moreover, the structural stability of Co-VN after long-term HER is also investigated by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to uncover its activity-stability trade-off riddle. As a result, Co-VN catalyst expectantly displays a low overpotential of 59 mV at −10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 46.3 mV dec−1, and a favorable long-term stability. The proposed regulation strategy of orbital electronic structure and free energy could be extended to design other high-performance catalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.139131
Strong electronic coupling between single Ru atoms and cobalt-vanadium layered double hydroxide harness efficient water splitting,"© 2022Atomic coordination modulation and electronic structure engineering are appealing routes to develop versatile electrocatalysts targeting high-performance water electrolysis. Herein, atomically dispersed Ru sites are successfully anchored on the surface of CoV layered double hydroxide (LDH), affording a vertically aligned and interconnected nanosheet array architecture. Benefitting from the strong electronic coupling, fast charge transfer capability and well-defined morphology of as-prepared catalyst, ultralow overpotentials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, η10 = 28 mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, η25 = 263 mV) are required. The two-electrode configuration cell only requires a cell voltage of 1.52 V to reach 10 mA cm−2, which is lower than that of commercialized Pt/C||RuO2 couple. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies in combination with density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong electronic coupling between monatomic Ru with CoV LDH induces spatial charge redistribution and a distorted coordination environment around V atoms, thereby accelerating the hydrogen release for HER and reducing the rate-determining step (O* → OOH*) free energy for OER.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.139151
Protein-mediated synthesis of iron single atom electrocatalyst with highly accessible active sites for enhanced pH-universal oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Facile synthesis of highly efficient non-precious metal electrocatalysts is intriguing as these catalysts are used in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we describe an effective protein-mediated approach to access atomically dispersed iron electrocatalyst (Fe SAs/NC) with enhanced accessible metal active sites. This Fe catalyst achieves an exceptional ORR activity in the pH-universal range, especially in alkaline and acid electrolytes with half-wave potentials of 0.93 and 0.84 V (vs RHE), respectively. The unique electronic structure of Fe sites with enhanced electron/proton transportation ability contributes to the optimized adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates. In addition, it shows robust durability and excellent tolerance to methanol crossover in pH-universal media. Impressively, it displays encouraging performance when employed in a zinc-air battery, demonstrating a peak power density of 275.1 mW cm−2 and a specific capacity of 753.8 mAh g−1. The extremely long-term operational stability of more than 250 h further provides significant potential for its application.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121987
N-bridged Ni and Mn single-atom pair sites: A highly efficient electrocatalyst for CO2 conversion to CO,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Herein, we report highly efficient diatomic electrocatalysts with Ni and Mn single-atom pair sites decorated on N-doped porous carbon framework for CO2 conversion. The resulting catalysts can preferentially and rapidly convert CO2 into CO with a high Faradaic efficiency of 98.3% and an industrially relevant current density of – 300 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of 0.287 V in a GDE-based flow reactor cell. Furthermore, it shows high cathodic energetic efficiencies over 80 % for CO production even under industrially relevant current densities. The in-depth experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that the synergistic electronic modification effect caused by coupling neighboring Ni and Mn single atoms exhibits favorable characteristics in reaction steps of CO2 conversion such as CO2 adsorption/activation and immobilization of CO2 radical intermediate as well as adsorbed CO desorption, leading to highly efficient CO production.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121953
Facile synthesis of Fe3C-dominated Fe/Fe3C/FeN0.0324 multiphase nanocrystals embedded in nitrogen-modified graphitized carbon as efficient pH-universal catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction and zinc-air battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Iron-based nitrogen-doped carbonaceous materials are currently the most promising alternative towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts due to the highly efficient active sites of single-atom Fe-NX coordination. However, the fact that iron-containing nanocrystals are easier to form during pyrolysis without additional tuning while providing activity comparable to single-atom sites cannot be ignored. Herein, we propose a facile and efficient strategy to synthesize iron nanocrystals sites with multiphase embedded in porous nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon (Fe/Fe3C/FeN0.0324@N-GC-X, X = 700, 850, and 1000). Based on highly active Fe3C@N-GC sites and the synergistic effect of Fe3C-dominated multiple iron-based, Fe/Fe3C/FeN0.0324@N-GC-850 exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity towards ORR in pH-universal media. Specifically, it exhibits satisfactory onset potential (Eonset), half-wave potential (E1/2) and stability, and thus surpassing the benchmark Pt/C in both alkaline and neutral media as well as approaching Pt/C in acidic media. When employed as an air cathode in zinc-air batteries (ZABs), it also presents higher open-circuit voltage (OCV), discharge voltage plateaus, capacity, and peak power density compared with Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that Fe3C (2 2 0)/N-GC has lower activation energy during ORR process and the overpotential generated by Fe3C/N-GC (0.7 V) is obviously less than one of Fe/N-GC (1.37 V) and FeN0.0324/N-GC (1.69 V).",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.138823
Microenvironment engineering of Fe-single-atomic-site with nitrogen coordination anchored on carbon nanotubes for boosting oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline and acidic media,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing cost-effective and high-performance non-precious electrocatalysts for ORR in acidic and alkaline media is an urgent need for clean energy generation. A significant improvement in the ORR performance has been realized by the single-atom catalysts (SACs). However, activity deterioration caused by the dissolution of catalyst structure is still a lingering challenge. Herein, we report a simple strategy for protecting the structure of SAC by implanting/decorating Fe-ZIF-derived carbon nanotubes with Fe-N4, denoted as FeSA@CNTs. The as-developed FeSA@CNTs catalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR activity in an alkaline medium with onset potential (Eo) = 0.998 V and half-wave potential E1/2 = 0.898 V, which are 28 mV and 29 mV higher than commercial 20% Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, FeSA@CNTs in an acidic medium show an impressive high half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.8290 V) comparable to Pt/C (E1/2 = 0.8292 V) which is better than most recently reported ORR catalysts. The density functional theory (DFT) validates that the smaller difference in the energy orbitals of Fe in Fe-N4 and O2 improved the electron transfer onto the reaction intermediate (OH*) in the rate-determining step, which provides the higher catalytic activity for FeSA@CNTs' in both acidic and alkaline media.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.138684
A novel one-step calcination tailored single-atom iron and nitrogen co-doped carbon material catalyst for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Single atom Fe-N-C based electrocatalysts are the most promising candidates for industrial applications of reduction of CO2. However, preparation of Fe-N-C catalyst often involves complex procedures and expensive precursors/reagents. In this work, we developed a novel one-step calcination method to tailor single-atom Fe-N-C catalyst for CO2 reduction. The maximum Faraday efficiency of CO (FECO) and the Tafel slope of Fe-N-C material was 73% and 68 mv dec−1, respectively, which was much higher than that of the pristine N-C material. The CO2 electroreduction products were CO and H2 with a total Faraday efficiency of 100%, indicating that the Fe-N-C material had high selectivity on CO2 reduction to CO. The designed Fe-Nx structure on the Fe-N-C material acted as a highly active site, and the abundant functional groups and microporous structure resulted in high catalytic performance of Fe-N-C material. This work demonstrates that the tailored single-atom Fe-N-C catalyst by one-step calcination has broad application prospects in the electrochemical reduction of CO2.",Separation and Purification Technology,10.1016/j.seppur.2022.122221
Computational exploration of dual atom catalysts loaded on defective graphene for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Single and paired atomic catalysts have attracted substantial interest due to their excellent catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Herein, a group of dual metal catalysts with various transition metal (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ru, and Pt) atoms supported on N-doped graphene with a four-atom vacancy (N8V4) were designed and screened for their ability to catalyze ORR. The density functional theory (DFT) method was employed to obtain theoretical overpotentials (η) to evaluate the performance of each catalyst in comparison with the benchmark catalyst, Pt/C (η = 0.45 V). The volcano plot of ΔG*OH versus onset potential was created. Our results showed that RuCo@N8V4, with paired Ru and Co atoms anchored in N8V4 pores, exhibited the best catalytic activity with an overpotential of 0.33 V on the top of volcano, followed by PtCo@N8V4 (0.38 V), ZnCo@N8V4 (0.41 V) and FeCo@N8V4 (0.43 V). Compared with a single Co atom catalyst Co@N8V4 (η = 0.72 V), it was found that the introduction of the second TM could significantly improve the catalytic performance. This is because the d-band center of the system shifts apart from Fermi energy level, reducing the adsorption of the OH intermediate. Moreover, the local polarization charges of Co and adsorption properties of O2 molecule are also improved by the nature of the second TM, hence enhancing the catalytic activity of the Co catalyst.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154534
Rational design of the first and second coordination spheres for copper single-atom catalyst to boost highly efficient oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Copper is an essential nutrient for all living things and as the component of more than 30 enzymes in the human body for the development of connective tissue, nerve coverings. However, carbon materials doped with nitrogen and transition metal singlet (M[sbnd]N[sbnd]C) with CuN4 site as reaction center usually exhibit unsatisfactory oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, due to poor O2 adsorption and activation. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) was used to explore the effect of introducing heteroatoms such as B, N, P, and S into the first and second coordination spheres to improve the ORR catalytic activity for Cu[sbnd]N[sbnd]C. Through the study of 41 model systems, we predicted CuN3 (ηORR = 0.32 V), CuN4P (II) (ηORR = 0.49 V) and CuN4S2(II) (ηORR = 0.37 V) fragments would have good ORR catalytic activity. This is due to the increased charge and tailored d-band fine structure, optimizing the reaction intermediate binding strength. These findings indicate the influence of the ligand field (formed by the anion in the first and second coordination spheres) on the catalytic activity and provide a new direction for the synthesis of high-efficiency electrocatalyst materials.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154832
Co single atoms and Co nanoparticle relay electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The commercialization of rechargeable zinc air batteries (ZABs) requires the discovery of high-performance, low-cost and durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. In this work, we report nitrogen doped carbon nano/microtubes confined metallic cobalt nanoparticles and single atoms (Co@NCNT/Co-SA@NCMT) as robust oxygen electrocatalyst for rechargeable ZABs. Co@NCNT/Co-SA@NCMT exhibits 18 times better ORR performance than Co@NCNT ascribed to the relay catalysis by Co-SAs and Co-NPs via O2→H2O2→H2O pathway. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that Co-SAs are capable of efficient oxygen reduction to H2O2, which is further reduced to H2O by Co-NPs due to its higher oxophilicity. Besides, due to the formed microtubes, the overpotential at 100 mA cm−2 in OER catalysis is lowered by 130 mV for Co@NCNT/Co-SA@NCMT than Co@NCNT. The power density of the assembled rechargeable ZAB is 155 mW cm−2 for Co@NCNT/Co-SA@NCMT outperforming the noble-metal counterpart (Pt/CB-IrO2: 71 mW cm−2). Furthermore, a superior stability with inappreciable increment in voltage gap for 300 h is achieved. Co@NCNT/Co-SA@NCMT also performs its high potential in the practical application with a maximum battery performance of 120 mW cm−2 sustained for 17 h in all-solid-state ZABs test.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121905
Engineering d-band center of iron single atom site through boron incorporation to trigger the efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Modulating the microenvironment of single-metal active sites holds excellent promises for developing highly efficiently oxygen electrocatalysts. Herein, by combining theoretical predictions and experiments, we reported a general strategy to engineer the electronic properties of iron-nitrogen-carbon (FeN4/C) catalysts via the incorporation of the boron (B) atom for achieving improved catalytic activity in oxygen electrocatalysis. Our theoretical results revealed that B modulation effectively tunes the d-band center of the iron (Fe) active site to optimize its adsorption strength with oxygenated species, greatly enhancing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) activity. Our experimental measurements then confirmed the above theoretical predictions: the as-synthesized B-doped FeN4/C (Fe-N4-B) material can perform as an eligible bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER in alkaline media, and its catalytic activity even outperforms the commercial noble metal benchmarks. The present findings provide a promising strategy to further design the advanced catalysts for a wide range of electrochemical applications.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2022.07.158
Enhanced electronic interaction between iron phthalocyanine and cobalt single atoms promoting oxygen reduction in alkaline and neutral aluminum-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Aluminum-air batteries (AABs) have received increasing interest for next-generation energy conversion systems. However, the development of AABs is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) is one of the active electrocatalysts for ORR but still far from Pt-based materials in terms of electrocatalytic performance. Herein, FePc molecules anchored on the Co single atoms/N-doped porous carbon nanofibers (denoted as FePc@Co-SAs/PCNF) with enhanced electronic interaction are prepared for the ORR. X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) analysis confirms the atomically dispersed Fe and Co sites and reveals the electronic interaction between FePc and Co-N3. The cobalt single atoms can break the electronic distribution symmetry of FePc and induce electronic localization to boost the ORR performance. As a result, the FePc@Co-SAs/PCNF electrocatalyst demonstrates a remarkable ORR activity in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes. The electrocatalytic ORR processes on the FePc@Co-SAs/PCNF are recorded by in-situ Raman spectra. Moreover, the ORR mechanism is discussed, which is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, the AABs based on FePc@Co-SAs/PCNF exhibit remarkable discharge performance.

Sulfur-doped unsaturated Ni-N3 coordination for efficient electroreduction of CO2,"© 2022Tuning coordination environment of metal atoms in catalysts can improve intrinsic performance of CO2 reduction and accelerate kinetics of CO formation. However, constructing unsaturated coordination configuration of metal single-atom by heteroatom doping still remains a challenge. Herein, a novel electrocatalyst of S/N co-coordinated Ni single-atom (denoted as Ni-SNC) was synthesized by calcining SO42- doped Zn/Ni ZIF for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The existence of single-atom Ni was verified by HAADF-STEM, while formation of “unsaturated” Ni-N3-S active sites was confirmed by XANES and EXAFS. The energy barrier of pivotal steps in CO2RR reaction process was reduced on “unsaturated” Ni-N3-S active sites, and sulfur doping improved current density of electrocatalytic process. The energy barrier of CO2→COOH* over Ni-SNC catalyst was only +0.69 eV, which was much less than that (+2.02 eV) over Ni-NC catalyst. The Ni-SNC exhibited CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of >90% at -0.6 ∼ -0.9 V vs. RHE with the highest FECO of 95% at −0.8 V.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.137950
Synergistic effect of dual active sites over Ru/α-MoC for accelerating alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts with ultra-low overpotential remains a significant challenge. In this paper, a three-dimensional porous Ru/α-MoC has been developed, which features the dual active sites of α-MoC and Ru. The coexistence of ultrafine Ru nanoparticles and Ru single atoms in Ru/α-MoC system is demonstrated by multiple structural characterizations. The fabricated Ru/α-MoC exhibits excellent alkaline HER activity with a low overpotential 25 mV at 10 mA cm−2, outperforming commercial 20% Pt/C (45 mV), and robust electrocatalytic stability at an industrial-scale current density of 400 mA cm−2. Particularly, the turnover frequency value reaches 39.2 s−1 at the overpotential of 100 mV. Experiments and theory investigations demonstrate the electron redistribution at the interface of α-MoC and Ru.

Lowering C−C coupling barriers for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to C2H4 by jointly engineering single Bi atoms and oxygen vacancies on CuO,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to commodity chemicals offers a promising way for mitigating the greenhouse effect and driving the transition from fossil-fuel dependence to a sustainable economy. To this end, the design and development of active and robust electrocatalysts is key. Here we report for the first time that incorporation of bismuth (Bi) single atoms on defective CuO could significantly enhance the ECR reaction to C2H4 by decreasing C–C coupling barriers. The overpotential for C2H4 production is lowered by at least 50 mV, along with a two-fold improvement in the faradaic efficiency, reaching 60% at 400 mA cm−2. The high performance is maintained even after 20 h of consecutive electrolysis. Control experiments along with density functional theory calculations suggest that the joint incorporation of Bi and oxygen vacancies greatly promotes CO2 adsorption and lowers C–C coupling energy barriers, thereby improving the C2H4 selectivity.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121823
Two-dimensional mineral hydrogel-derived single atoms-anchored heterostructures for ultrastable hydrogen evolution,"© 2022, The Author(s).Hydrogen energy is critical for achieving carbon neutrality. Heterostructured materials with single metal-atom dispersion are desirable for hydrogen production. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve large-scale fabrication of single atom-anchored heterostructured catalysts with high stability, low cost, and convenience. Here, we report single iron (Fe) atom-dispersed heterostructured Mo-based nanosheets developed from a mineral hydrogel. These rationally designed nanosheets exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and reliability in alkaline condition, manifesting an overpotential of 38.5 mV at 10 mA cm−2, and superior stability without performance deterioration over 600 h at current density up to 200 mA cm−2, superior to most previously reported non-noble-metal electrocatalysts. The experimental and density functional theory results reveal that the O-coordinated single Fe atom-dispersed heterostructures greatly facilitated H2O adsorption and enabled effective adsorbed hydrogen (H*) adsorption/desorption. The green, scalable production of single-atom-dispersed heterostructured HER electrocatalysts reported here is of great significance in promoting their large-scale implementation.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-022-33725-8
"ZnS-assisted evolution of N,S-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanofiber membrane with highly exposed Fe-N4/Cx sites for rechargeable Zn-air battery","© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesBinder-free bifunctional electrocatalysts are attractive for rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs) in grid-scale energy storage and flexible electronics, but suffering from the sluggish mass transport and inadequate catalytic capability. Herein, we propose a scalable approach of in-situ engineering highly exposed Fe-N4/Cx sites on the N,S-doped porous carbon nanofiber membrane as a binder-free air electrode catalyst for ZABs. ZnS nanospheres are firstly used as integrated structure-directing agents to facilitate the electronic modulation of Fe-N4/Cx sites by S doping and construct the hierarchical macro/meso/micropores at high temperature. Neither additional step for removal of ZnS nanospheres nor doping process is required, significantly simplifying the pore formation process and improving the S doping efficiency. Benefiting from the enhanced intrinsic activity of high-density Fe-N4/Cx sites (23.53 μmol g−1) and the optimized mass transport of carbon nanofibers, as-synthesized electrocatalyst shows a positive half-wave potential of 0.89 V for oxygen reduction reaction and a small overpotential of 0.47 V at 10 mA cm−2 for oxygen evolution reaction. When used as the air cathode catalyst for ZABs, it delivers a high specific capacity of 699 mAh g−1 at 5 mA cm−2, a large peak power density of 228 mW cm−2 and a prolonged cycling over 1000 h. At 10 mA cm−2, a robust structure with atomically dispersed Fe is also remained after cycling for 420 h. Due to the flexible properties of the electrocatalyst, as-assembled quasi-solid-state ZAB shows stable cycling over 90 h at alternately flat/bent states, demonstrating great prospects in flexible electronic device applications.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2022.08.017

Identifying and tailoring C–N coupling site for efficient urea synthesis over diatomic Fe–Ni catalyst,"© 2022, The Author(s).Electrocatalytic urea synthesis emerged as the promising alternative of Haber–Bosch process and industrial urea synthetic protocol. Here, we report that a diatomic catalyst with bonded Fe–Ni pairs can significantly improve the efficiency of electrochemical urea synthesis. Compared with isolated diatomic and single-atom catalysts, the bonded Fe–Ni pairs act as the efficient sites for coordinated adsorption and activation of multiple reactants, enhancing the crucial C–N coupling thermodynamically and kinetically. The performance for urea synthesis up to an order of magnitude higher than those of single-atom and isolated diatomic electrocatalysts, a high urea yield rate of 20.2 mmol h−1 g−1 with corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 17.8% has been successfully achieved. A total Faradaic efficiency of about 100% for the formation of value-added urea, CO, and NH3 was realized. This work presents an insight into synergistic catalysis towards sustainable urea synthesis via identifying and tailoring the atomic site configurations.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-022-33066-6
Etching-assisted synthesis of single atom Ni-tailored Pt nanocatalyst enclosed by high-index facets for active and stable oxygen reduction catalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdDesigning structure and compositional distribution are critical for developing high-performance Pt-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts for fuel cells and other metal-air batteries. Here, we report a facile method to simultaneously dope single-atom Ni and expose high-index facets (HIFs) for Pt nanocrystals by chemical etching with HCl. The optimized catalyst displays a mass activity of 2.63 A mgPt−1 and specific activity of 4.15 mA cmPt−2 (0.1 M HClO4), which are both ∼15 times higher than those of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. Particularly, it shows remarkably enhanced cycling stability. The density functional theory calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the construction of HIFs and single-atom Ni activation in Pt lattice lessen oxygen adsorption energy, which causes enhanced activity. Besides, regulating sub-layer Ni distribution also strengthens the Pt-Pt bonds on the surface, resulting in improved ORR stability.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107800

Hierarchical macro-mesoporous electrocatalysts with dual-active sites of Ru single atoms and monodispersed Ru–Mo nanoclusters for efficient hydrogen evolution,"© 2022Rationally designing high-performance electrocatalysts with high density and multiactive sites is an effective strategy to accelerate the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics, yet it remains challenging. Herein, a catalyst comprising numerous Ru–Mo-based single atoms and subnanoclusters incorporated into a hierarchical macro-mesoporous carbon framework with a P-doped skeleton (Ru–Mo/PC) was successfully developed via a simple template-assisted pyrolysis method. Spherical aberration correction electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements revealed that the dual-active sites consisted of Ru–C5 single atoms and ultrasmall Ru–Mo nanoclusters (mean diameter of 0.94 nm). In particular, the as-constructed RuMo1.5/PC catalyst exhibited a high activity towards the HER, requiring an overpotential of only 17.9 mV at 10 mA/cm2, which outperformed a commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline media. Electrochemical performance results also indicated that introducing moderate Mo species played a crucial role in further boosting the HER activity compared to Ru/PC. The present work provides a step forward in designing efficient and stable catalysts with high-density, atomically dispersed active sites for hydrogen production.",Materials Today Chemistry,10.1016/j.mtchem.2022.101046
Porphyrinic MOF derived Single-atom electrocatalyst enables methanol oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) serves as a key route for renewable energy technologies. However, unmet challenges remain in the preparation of low-cost, efficient and robust electrocatalysts for MOR. Herein, a porphyrinic metal–organic framework (MOF) with spatially isolated Ni centres is prepared. Upon pyrolysis, this affords a single-atom Ni implanted nitrogen-doped porous carbon (20% Ni-N-C).

We demonstrate one-step synthesis of carbon–nitrogen (CN)-coordinated Fe-Mo double atom catalyst with high atom utilization efficiency towards both ORR and OER. The catalyst exhibits enhanced activity with lower overpotential associated with ORR and OER (ΔE = Ej=10(OER) - E1/2(ORR)) and better mass activity in comparison to that of Mo-N-C and Fe-N-C, even better than the state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts for ORR and OER, respectively. This place the double atom catalysts in the series of non-precious metal based bifunctional catalysts for overall oxygen electrochemistry and is due to the electronic structure modification around the metal atoms induced by other neighbouring metal atom. The double atom Fe-Mo-N-C exhibits a remarkable and highly durable ORR performance with suppressed peroxide generation due to the muted outer sphere electron transfer mechanism in comparison with the commercially available state-of-the-art Pt/C electrocatalyst. Moreover, Fe-Mo-N-C shows remarkable enhanced overall oxygen electrochemistry at higher temperature (323 K - a temperature 25 K above the room temperature), widening its applicability. Overall, this work paves the way to design multi-atom catalysts towards multi-functional electrocatalytic activities.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.137705
Atomic-precision Pt6 nanoclusters for enhanced hydrogen electro-oxidation,"© 2022, The Author(s).The discord between the insufficient abundance and the excellent electrocatalytic activity of Pt urgently requires its atomic-level engineering for minimal Pt dosage yet maximized electrocatalytic performance. Here we report the design of ultrasmall triphenylphosphine-stabilized Pt6 nanoclusters for electrocatalytic hydrogen oxidation reaction in alkaline solution. Benefiting from the self-optimized ligand effect and atomic-precision structure, the nanocluster electrocatalyst demonstrates a high mass activity, a high stability, and outperforms both Pt single atoms and Pt nanoparticle analogues, uncovering an unexpected size optimization principle for designing Pt electrocatalysts. Moreover, the nanocluster electrocatalyst delivers a high CO-tolerant ability that conventional Pt/C catalyst lacks. Theoretical calculations confirm that the enhanced electrocatalytic performance is attributable to the bifold effects of the triphenylphosphine ligand, which can not only tune the formation of atomically precise platinum nanoclusters, but also shift the d-band center of Pt atoms for favorable adsorption kinetics of *H, *OH, and CO.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-022-29276-7

However, the sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LPS) and its shuttling effects have impeded the practical applications of Li-S batteries. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomically dispersed metal-based sites have been applied as a promising candidate for electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries. Herein, we design and demonstrate a single atom Fe-N/C catalyst impregnated with N, P–doped carbon (FeN6–NPC), N, P–doped carbon material (NPC), as well as Fe2P nanoparticles anchored with N, P–doped carbon (Fe2P–NPC). In-depth XANES and FT-EXAFS analyses were used to characterize the precise architecture of SACs containing Fe-N/C active sites. The electrochemical results of SACs with Fe-N/C active site configuration reveal the highest catalytic lithium polysulfide conversion compared to the NPC and nanoparticle anchored samples. In addition, the SACs enable FeN6–NPC/S electrode to deliver a high discharge capacity of 1115 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and maintain 570 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles with excellent Columbic efficiency (>99%). This work successfully develops organic-based strategies for SACs that suppress lithium polysulfide formation, improve cyclic stability, and increase Coulombic efficiency for lithium-sulfur batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166132

Here the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) on the newly-reported 2D-Fe2C12 materials has been intensively investigated using density functional theory (DFT). We found that the 2D-Fe2C12 monolayer with atomically dispersed Fe atoms on the same side, denoted as 1s-Fe2C12, possessing high activity and selectivity toward NRR due to the cooperative interaction of two adjacent individual Fe active sites. The NRR channel starting from the bridge-on adsorbed configuration *N-*N has a low onset potential of −0.58 V, and this value could be further reduced to −0.40 V by including the solvation effect. The relatively large energy differences of ∼−0.3 eV for ΔG(*N2)-ΔG(*H) and the almost neutral value for ΔG(*H)-ΔG(*N2→*N-*NH) guarantee the high selectivity for NRR on 1s-Fe2C12. These findings suggest that 1s-Fe2C12 should have great potential for the design of highly efficient electrocatalysts for NRR.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154380

Fe SAC exhibits both high faradaic efficiency (~92%) and high ammonia yield rate (46 mg h−1 mg cat.−1) in neutral electrolytes. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the O atoms in FeN2O2 can tune the d-band center of Fe and thus adjust the adsorption energies of the NO3-RR intermediates. Compared to FeN4, FeN2O2 structure has higher conductivity and selectivity to NH3 and can spontaneously trigger the transformation of *NOH to N *, thus promoting the NO3-RR.

Here, atomically dispersed Pt on ultrafine Ru nanoclusters (∼1.46 nm) loaded by the commercial acetylene black (Acet) support is fabricated by a facile one-step cold-plasma technique. The Pt single atoms on Ru nanoclusters electrocatalyst (Pt0.47-Ru/Acet) with 0.47 wt% content of Pt exhibit an excellent HER activity in all pH, achieving ultralow overpotential of only 17, 28, and 8 mV at 10 mA·cm−2 in 1 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1 M PBS, respectively. And the mass activity of Pt0.47-Ru/Acet catalyst in alkaline is about 5.54 and 2.15 times that of commercial Ru/C and Pt/C catalyst at an overpotential of 100 mV, respectively. Meanwhile, after 8000 CV cycles, there is barely performance decrease for Pt0.47-Ru/Acet, displaying good stability. DFT calculation reveals that the Pt single atoms could effectively regulate the electronic structure of Ru clusters, and reduce the energy barriers of water dissociation (Volmer step) as well as subsequent hydrogen evolution (Heyrovsky step), thus enhancing the alkaline HER performance effectively.

Electroreductive C[sbnd]O coupling of benzaldehyde over SACs Au–NiMn2O4 spinel synergetic composites,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Electroreductive C[sbnd]O coupling provides a prospective strategy for biomass derivative upgrading via reducing the number of oxygen-containing functional groups and increasing their molecular weight. However, exploring superior electrocatalysts with effective reactivity and high selectivity for target products are still a challenge. In this work, single atom Au surface derived NiMn2O4 (SACs Au−NiMn2O4) spinel synergetic composites were fabricated by a versatile adsorption-deposition method and applied in electroreductive self-coupling of benzaldehyde to dibenzyl ether. The SACs Au–NiMn2O4 spinel synergetic composites enhanced electroreductive coupling of benzaldehyde, significantly improved the yield and selectivity of dibenzyl ether. Systematic characterizations and density functional theory calculation revealed that atomically dispersed Au occupied surface Ni2+ vacancies, which played a dominated role in C[sbnd]O coupling of benzaldehyde. Detailed calculation results showed that benzaldehyde preferred to adsorb on Ni octa-hedral sites of NiMn2O4 spinel synergetic structure, single atom Au surficial derivation over NiMn2O4 further reduced the adsorption energy (Eads) of benzaldehyde on SACs Au−NiMn2O4, thus the C[sbnd]O coupling of benzaldehyde to dibenzyl ether was promoted. Moreover, single atom Au surficial derivation lowered the energy barrier of rate-determining step, facilitated the formation of dibenzyl ether species.

All rights reserved.The regulation of the coordination environment of the central metal atom is considered as an alternative way to enhance the performance of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Herein, we design an electrocatalyst with active sites of isolated Co atoms coordinated with four sulfur atoms supported on N-doped carbon frameworks (Co1-S4/NC), confirmed by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HADDF-STEM) and synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy.

Herein, we present a facile strategy to fabricate the hierarchical porous carbon nanospheres with isolated single-atom iron sites by using the dual-template method of combination of triblock polymers F127 and silica as soft and hard templates, respectively.

Single-atom transition metals supported on defective graphene for electrochemical reduction of acetonitrile to ethylamine,"© 2022The electrochemical acetonitrile (CH3CN) reduction reaction provides an alternative to produce ethylamine (CH3CH2NH2) under ambient conditions but remains challenging. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explored the catalytic performance of four types of graphene-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) total of 32 materials toward the CH3CN reduction reaction. We identified that two highly stable SACs, namely Cr@N4 and Mn@N4, can greatly accelerate both reaction thermodynamics and kinetics with small energy barriers. In particular, these two SACs can effectively suppress the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by selective adsorption of key intermediate of *CH3CN rather than *H, which feature superior catalytic selectivity. More impressively, the activity trends of various candidates can be directly correlated to the adsorption energy of *CH3CHN (ΔE(*CH3CHN)), and the underlying activity origin is ascribed by the enhancement of the adsorption for the *CH3CHN. Furthermore, detailed electronic property analyses indicate that the bonding/anti-bonding interactions of different active metal centers with *CH3CHN are the key factor determining the adsorption strength. The more bonding contributions below the Fermi level (Ef) lead to the stronger *CH3CHN combination on active metal centers, while the anti-bonding state is opposite. As a result, Cr@N4 stands out among these candidates, which can tune the performance of acetonitrile reduction reaction by balancing the reactivity of CH3CN and the desorption of CH3CH2NH2. Our results unveil that the excellent catalytic activity of Cr@N4 for CH3CN reduction reaction can be further confirmed by calculating the bond lengths and charge variations. With the elongation of C[tbnd]N bond in the adsorbed CH3CHxNHy, CH3CN molecule can be effectively activated on Cr@N4. Overall, this work addresses a promising active catalyst and will be of a guidance of great theoretical significance to construct carbon-based materials supported transition metal single-atom electrocatalysts for the CH3CN reduction reaction.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153948

We have employed a three-dimensional hierarchical porous carbon (3D-HPC) substrate and nanocrystal co-existed highly dense Pt single atoms deposited by the incipient wetness impregnation method. The special structure of the 3D-HPC substrate favors the homogeneous dispersion of Pt all over the 3D-HPC, leading to nanocrystal co-existed highly dense atomically disperse Pt@3D-HPC. The as-prepared Pt@3D-HPC shows outstanding catalytic properties towards tri-iodide and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The Pt@3D-HPC electrode shows lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface with narrow peak-to-peak separation (△Epp) and higher peak current density during the tri-iodide reduction reaction (IRR). The DSSC fabricated with a Pt@3D-HPC electrode shows improved performance compared to the reference Pt counter electrode (CE). Furthermore, CV and LSV demonstrate the better catalytic activity of Pt@3D-HPC towards ORR, with higher onset potential (Eonset), half-wave potential (E1/2), and current density (j) compared to the reference 20% Pt/C electrode. Furthermore, impressive mass activity was observed by the Pt@3D-HPC catalyst compared to 20% Pt/C and other recently reported single atom-based catalysts.

A hierarchical Single-Atom Ni-N3-C catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO with Near-Unity faradaic efficiency in a broad potential range,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Single atom catalysts have been shown highly efficient in catalyzing electrochemical CO2 reduction, but their large-scale synthesis and stable operation under high current densities are still rare. Herein a simple but robust template method was developed for gram-scale synthesis of single-atom Ni-N-C catalysts, exploiting the natural abundant and low-cost guar gum. Benefiting from its under-coordinated Ni-N3 configuration to afford high catalytic activity and hierarchical porosity to promote mass/charge transfer, the as-fabricated Ni-N/PC catalyst achieved a low overpotential of 290 mV at 100 mA cm−2, a near-unity faradaic efficiency in a wide potential range from −0.3 V to −0.8 V, as well as a stable operation for >70 h in a membrane electrode assembly with an extraordinary total energy efficiency of 41.0%. By mass-producing a highly potent single-atom electrocatalyst and demonstrating its stable operation in industrial-relevant conditions, this study paves the way for fulfilling the carbon neutral goal through the carbon-negative CO2RR process.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.137296
Atomically Dispersed Fe-N5 Sites Anchored in Porous N-Doped Carbon Nanofibers for Effective Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Atomically dispersed electrocatalysts are a major focus of chemical and energy conversion, while the structure and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance affected by single atoms loading need to be further explored. Herein, we developed an N-coordination strategy to design Fe-N5sites distributed on N-doped porous nanofibers (Fe SA/PNCNFs-0.1) as an efficient HER catalyst by the wet impregnation method. The results show that Fe species exist in the form of dispersed single atoms. The binding between the Fe atom and N atom is strong, forming the coordination structure of Fe-N5. In the acidic HER, Fe SA/PNCNFs-0.1 improves the catalytic performance toward the HER with a small overpotential of 44.3 mV at 10 mA cm-2current density and a low Tafel slope of 45.4 mV dec-1, which are superior to those of Fe single atoms with less Fe contents (Fe SA/PNCNFs-0.4) and Fe nanoparticles (Fe NP/PNCNFs).

Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Glycerol via Promoted OH∗ Generation over Single-Atom-Bismuth-Doped Spinel Co3O4,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The renewable electricity-driven electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass represents a pathway to produce value-added chemicals from waste biomass such as glycerol (a byproduct of industrial biodiesel production). However, it remains difficult to design an efficient electrocatalyst with explicit structure-property relationships. Herein, we report a single-atom bismuth (Bi)-doping strategy to endow Co3O4with enhanced activity and selectivity toward electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that single-atom Bi substitutes cobalt at octahedral sites (CoOh3+) in Co3O4, facilitating the generation of reactive hydroxyl species (OH*) at adjacent tetrahedral Co sites (CoTd2+). Mechanism studies demonstrate that OH∗ accelerates the oxidation of hydroxyl groups and carbon-carbon (C-C) bond cleavage, achieving GOR activity (400 mA cm-2at 1.446 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and high faradaic efficiency of formate (97.05 ± 2.55%). Our study shows a promising way to promote the electro-oxidation activity of spinel oxides for biomass valorization by a single-atom doping strategy.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.2c03162
Prediction of single-boron anchored on MXene catalysts for high-efficient electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2022The design of efficient catalysts plays an important role in the development of electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). 2D materials MXene can be used as promising catalyst substrates in NRR due to their superior chemical stability and conductivity. Here, using density functional theory calculations, 9 kinds of single-atom catalysts (SACs) B@M3C2O2-x (M = Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W) were constructed by anchoring electron-deficient non-metal boron atom on M3C2O2-x with one terminal-O vacancy. All SACs have good thermodynamic and electrochemical stability. The strong acceptor-donor interaction between B atom and N2 molecule leads to the activation of N2, thus promoting NRR. We adopted the screening strategies, including comparing the free energy of N2 adsorption, the free energy changes for the first and last electrochemical steps of NRR, and the selectivity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Finally, five candidate catalysts (B@V3C2O2-x, B@Cr3C2O2-x, B@Nb3C2O2-x, B@Mo3C2O2-x and B@W3C2O2-x) were screened out. Starting from the end-on adsorption mode of N2, NRR proceeds through a mixed mechanism on each SAC. Our results show that these five SACs have excellent catalytic performance with the limiting potentials ranging from -0.32 to -0.48 V, which may be promising NRR electrocatalysts.",Molecular Catalysis,10.1016/j.mcat.2022.112658

The as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibits excellent bifunctional oxygen activity, with a low overpotential of 304 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and a high half-wave potential (0.861 V) for the oxygen reduction reaction, resulting in a low potential gap (ΔE) of 0.673 V. The exceptional composite design and synergistic interaction of each component are responsible for the excellent bifunctional catalytic performance.

Density functional theory calculation further reveals the synergy mechanism between Fe-N4, Co-N4 atomic sites and FeCo-nanoparticles, which can induce higher Fe-d/Co-d anti-bond orbitals filling degree and weaken the binding ability of oxygen intermediates, as a result in improving the oxygen evolution reaction/oxygen reduction reaction activity.",Materials Today Energy,10.1016/j.mtener.2022.101138

In this work, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we have investigated the HER, OER and ORR catalytic activities of a series of transition atoms (including Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt) anchored on square graphyne (TM@S-GPY). Our results revealed that the Ni@S-GPY can act as a promising trifunctional catalyst for HER/OER/ORR with overpotentials of 0.07/0.43/0.36 V, while Pt@S-GPY and Ir@S-GPY can be utilized as eligible bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting (HER/OER) with overpotentials of 0.04/0.59 and 0.07/0.36 V, respectively. In addition, Pd@S-GPY exhibits high catalytic activity for OER/ORR with overpotentials of 0.40/0.34 V. Especially, depending on their diverse electronic properties, the catalytic activity of these SACs can be well rationalized by their optimal binding strengths with reaction intermediates. Thus, S-GPY is an ideal support for immobilizing single atom catalysts to design stable and highly-efficient multifunctional catalysts in various electrochemical processes.",Molecular Catalysis,10.1016/j.mcat.2022.112706

The synthesized catalysts exhibit a unique 3D open sheet-like structure, and the average size of Co particles is 4.45 nm while encouragingly, a small amount of quasi single-atom cobalt (mean particle size 0.5 nm) is also found in the samples. In addition, the mass ratio of g-C3N4 to CoPc presents a significant effect on ORR activity of the samples. Among the samples, g-C3N4@CoPc-3 shows excellent ORR performance with the onset potential of 0.94 V in neutral condition and the half-wave potential of 1.00 V in alkaline condition, both better than Pt/C. Its onset potentials in acidic (0.83 V) and alkaline (1.07 V) conditions are also comparable to Pt/C. In a full pH range (acidic, alkaline, and neutral) electrolyte, the prepared samples catalyze ORR via a direct four-electron reaction pathway, and the C3N4@CoPc-3 reveals high catalytic stability and high anti-alcohol tolerance. Results provide wide feasibility for the synthesis and application of g-C3N4@CoPc-3 in fuel cells.",Advanced Materials Interfaces,10.1002/admi.202201330
Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Fe-N-C Cathode in Long-durable Direct Glycol Fuel Cells,"© 2022, Jilin University, The Editorial Department of Chemical Research in Chinese Universities and Springer-Verlag GmbH.The oxygen reduction reaction in direct glycol fuel cells heavily relies on noble metal-based electrocatalysts. In this work, novel Pt group metal-free catalysts based on porous Fe-N-C materials are successfully synthesized as catalysts with high activity and durability for the cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Through the encapsulation of NH4SCN salt, the surface elements and pore structure of the catalyst are effectively changed, and the active sites of Fe effectively are increased.

Transition metal atom anchored by defective WSSe monolayer as bifunctional single atom catalyst for ORR and OER,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Bifunctional electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are key for developing efficient energy conversion and storage technology. Here, we investigated the ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity of transition metal atoms (TM) anchored at the S and Se vacancy sites of WSSe monolayer (TM@S-WSSe, TM@Se-WSSe) via performing the first-principles calculation. Our result shows that the single atom catalysts (SACs) Pt@S-WSSe and Pt@Se-WSSe have low ORR/OER overpotentials (ηORR/ηOER) of 0.31/0.36 V and 0.43/0.34 V, respectively. The ηORR and ηOER at SAC Pt@S-WSSe are even lower compared with the previously studied SACs. Besides, the Gibbs free energy changes of the key intermediate adsorption are close to the values at ideal catalyst. Our calculations demonstrate the promising potential of Pt@S-WSSe and Pt@Se-WSSe as ORR and OER bifunctional SACs. More importantly, the superior ORR and OER catalytic activity of TM@S-WSSe and TM@Se-WSSe are well explained via the intrinsic feature of SACs as well as the interaction between the TM atom and the intermediates. Especially, we demonstrate that the magnetic moment and the catalytic activity of SACs TM@S-WSSe and TM@Se-WSSe is closely correlated. Our result provides new idea for designing highly effectual ORR and OER bifunctional SACs.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry,10.1016/j.jelechem.2022.116731
Carbon-Shielded Single-Atom Alloy Material Family for Multi-Functional Electrocatalysis,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Encapsulating metal-based catalysts inside carbon sheaths is a frequently-adopted strategy to enhance their durability under various harsh situations and improve their catalytic activity simultaneously. Such carbon encapsulation, however, imposes significant complications for directly modifying materials’ surface atomic/electronic configurations, fundamentally impeding the accurate tuning of their catalytic capabilities. Herein, a universal single-atom alloy (SAA) strategy is reported to indirectly yet precisely manipulate the surface electronic structure of carbon-encapsulated electrocatalysts. By versatilely constructing a SAA core inside an N-doped carbon sheath, material's electrocatalytic capability can be flexibly tuned. The one with Ru-SAA cores serves as an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen/hydrogen evolution, exhibiting minimal cell voltage of 1.55 V (10 mA cm−2) and outstanding mass activity of 1251 mA m (Formula presented.) for overall water splitting, while the one with Ir-SAA cores possesses superior oxygen reduction activity with a half-wave potential of 919 mV. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the doped atoms can simultaneously optimize the adsorption of protons (H*) and oxygenated intermediates (OH*, O*, and OOH*) to achieve the remarkable thermoneutral hydrogen evolution and enhanced oxygen evolution. This work thus demonstrates a versatile strategy to precisely modify the surface electronic properties of carbon-shielded materials for optimized performances.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202205654
Enhancing electrical conductivity of single-atom doped Co3O4 nanosheet arrays at grain boundary by phosphor doping strategy for efficient water splitting,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.High electrical conductivity guarantees a rapid electron transfer and thus plays an important role in electrocatalysis. In particular, for the single atom catalysts (SACs), to facilitate interaction between the single atom and supports, precisely engineering the conductivity represents a promising strategy to design SACs with high electrochemical efficiency. Here we show rhodium (Rh) SAC anchored on Co3O4 nanosheets arrays on nickel foam (NF), which is modified by a facile phosphorus (P-doped Rh SAC-Co3O4/NF), possessing an appropriate electronic structure and high conductivity for electrocatalytic reaction. With the introduction of P atom in the lattice, the electrocatalyst demonstrates outstanding alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with 50 mA·cm−2 under overpotential of 268 mV, 6 times higher than that of Ir/C/NF. More interestingly, the P-doped Rh SAC-Co3O4/NF can get 50 mA·cm−2 at only 1.77 V for overall water splitting. Both electrical conductivity studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the high conductivity at grain boundary improves the charge transfer efficiency of the Rh catalytic center. Furthermore, other noble-metal (Ir, Pd, and Ru) doped Co3O4 nanosheets arrays are prepared to exhibit the general efficacy of the phosphorus doping strategy.

Ultrahigh-Content Co-P Cluster as a Dual-Atom-Site Electrocatalyst for Accelerating Polysulfides Conversion in Li–S Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) show high catalytic efficiency in accelerating conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS), and are thus promising for suppressing the shuttle effect observed in lithium−sulfur batteries (LSBs); however, single-atom catalytic sites with low content of catalysts largely restrict their catalytic effect. Herein, a Co-P cluster supported by a N-doped carbon matrix (Co-P cluster/NC) with atomic-level dispersion and an ultrahigh content (25.5 wt.%) of Co atoms is fabricated via an in situ low-temperature phosphorization strategy and employed as a dual-atom-site catalyst for catalyzing LiPS conversion. The Co-P cluster/NC with abundant unsaturated Co-P coordination provides dual-atom sites of Co and P to dynamically adsorb/desorb sulfur species and Li+ ions, respectively, synergistically promoting the conversion of LiPS. The dual-atom-site catalytic mechanism is evidenced by substantial characterizations including X-ray absorption fine structure measurements and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, the S@Co-P cluster/NC cathode shows superior cycling and rate performance. Even at a high sulfur loading of 6.2 mg cm−2, a high areal capacity of 6.5 mAh cm−2 that surpasses most commercial lithium–ion batteries can be achieved.

Regeneration of single-atom catalysts deactivated under acid oxygen reduction reaction conditions,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesSingle-atom catalysts serve as a promising candidate to realize noble-metal-free electrocatalytic oxygen reduction in acid media. However, their poor stability under working conditions strictly restrains their practical applications. Therefore, regeneration of their electrocatalytic activity is of great significance. Herein, the regeneration of a Fe–N–C single-atom catalyst is demonstrated to be feasible by a facile annealing regeneration strategy. The activity after regeneration recovers to that of the pristine electrocatalyst and surpasses the deactivated electrocatalyst. The regeneration mechanism is identified to be self-etching of the surface carbon layer and consequent exposure of the previously buried single-atom sites. Furthermore, the regeneration strategy is applicable to other single-atom catalysts. This work demonstrates the feasibility of regenerating oxygen reduction electrocatalysts and affords a pioneering approach to deal with rapid deactivation under working conditions.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2022.06.005
Engineering the morphology and electronic structure of atomic cobalt-nitrogen-carbon catalyst with highly accessible active sites for enhanced oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesThe stabilization of non-precious metals as isolated active sites with high loading density over nitrogen-doped carbon materials is essential for realizing the industrial application of single atom catalysts. However, achieving high loading of single cobalt active sites with greatly enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability remains challenging. Here, an efficient approach was described to create a single atom cobalt electrocatalyst (Co SAs/NC) which possesses enhanced mesoporosity and specific surface area that greatly favor the mass transportation and exposure of accessible active sites. The electronic structure of the catalyst by the strong metal-support interaction has been elucidated through experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Due to dramatically enhanced mass transport and electron transfer endowed by morphology and electronic structure engineering, Co SAs/NC exhibits remarkable ORR performance with excellent activity (onset and half-wave potentials of 1.04 V (RHE) and 0.90 V (RHE), Tafel slope of 69.8 mV dec−1 and Jk of 18.8 mA cm−2 at 0.85 V) and stability (7 mV activity decay after 10,000 cycles). In addition, the catalyst demonstrates great promise as an alternative to traditional Pt/C catalyst in zinc-air batteries while maintaining high performance in terms of high specific capacity of (796.1 mAh/gZn), power density (175.4 mW/cm2), and long-term cycling stability (140 h).

Mechanistic exploring the catalytic activity of single-atom catalysts anchored in graphitic carbon nitride toward electroreduction of nitrate-to-ammonia,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electroreduction of water-pollutant nitrate to valuable ammonia provides a green and efficient route for low-temperature NH3 production instead of the convention Haber-Bosch process. However, finding robust catalysts for achieving nitrate to ammonia conversion remains a challenge due to the lack of a mechanistic view on the highly complex nitrate reduction and NH3 selectivity. Herein, we systematically investigate electrocatalytic activity and NH3 selectivity of a single-atom catalyst supported on graphitic carbon nitride (TM/g-C3N4) for nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) using first-principles calculations. Our results reveal that Ti/g-C3N4, V/g-C3N4, and Nb/g-C3N4 serve as the most promising NO3RR catalysts, as they exhibit stability, excellent activity, high selectivity (Faradaic efficiency of ∼ 100%), and low limiting potential (−0.42, −0.25, and −0.40 V for Ti/g-C3N4, V/g-C3N4, and Nb/g-C3N4, respectively). In addition, considerable potential energy barriers are found in the formation of byproducts NO2, NO, and N2O, validating their high selectivity. Nitrate to ammonia conversion is more competitive than hydrogen evolution reaction on TM/g-C3N4 owning to a lower limiting potential. This work reveals the structure dependence of NO3RR reaction pathways in single-atom catalysts and opens a new avenue for designing more efficient catalysts for NO3RR under ambient conditions.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153829

Here, the potentials of 29 transition-metal atoms anchored on the nitrogen-doped BP monolayer (MN3/BP) as efficient NORR catalysts are systematically examined using first-principles calculations. Combining the adsorption Gibbs free energies of the N and OH species, a simple descriptor is constructed and a volcano plot of the NORR limiting potentials on the single atom catalysts (SACs) is established. Consequently, the MoN3/BP and IrN3/BP SACs are picked out as promising NORR electrocatalysts for NH3 synthesis with the limiting potentials of −0.10 V and −0.06 V, respectively. Their corresponding rate constants are significantly larger than or close to that of the excellent Pt(1 1 1) surface. The electronic analysis shows that the Mo-4d or Ir-5d orbitals can be well hybridized with the NO-2p orbitals, sufficiently activating the adsorbed NO species. Particularly, the MoN3/BP and IrN3/BP SACs possess high thermal stabilities and can be easily synthesized by using MoCl3 and IrCl3 as precursors, respectively. This work not only offers a simple descriptor to efficiently design NORR electrocatalysts but also provides a comprehensive atomic understanding on the mechanism of NO-to-NH3 conversion.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2022.05.034

Insight into the Evolution of Ordered Mesoporous sp2Carbonaceous Material Derived from Self-Assembly of a Block Copolymer,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Block-copolymer-derived ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) materials have great potential in many applications, such as adsorption, catalysis, and energy conversions; however, their formation process and the kinetic mechanism remain unclear. Herein, a N-doped OMC (N-OMC) with sp2-bonded C atoms is developed via self-assembly of the polystyrene-block-poly(4-vinyl pyridine) block copolymer. By correlating the external morphologies with the internal chemical states, the formation process can be concluded as follows: (1) pore evolution via polystyrene domain degradation and (2) regularization and graphitization of the residual carbon via the removal of sp3 C atoms. In addition, the thickness of the N-OMC shows a power function relationship with the spin-coating rate, and the N content can be incredibly increased up to 26.34 at. % in an NH3 carbonization atmosphere. With the as-prepared N-OMC as the support for loading of the pseudo-atomic-scale Pt (Pt/N-OMC), a high electrochemical active surface area value of 99.64 m2·g-1 and a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.850 VRHE are achieved, showing great potential in developing single-atom electrocatalysts.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c10356

Results from operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggest that manganese leaching from the nanoparticles during galvanic replacement introduces lattice vacancies that make the nanoparticles more susceptible to metal oxidation and catalyst reconstruction under an applied anodic potential. This results in an increased presence of electrophilic oxygen atoms on the catalyst surface during reaction conditions, which may contribute to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward cyclooctene epoxidation.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.2c04711

Synergistic Hybrid Electrocatalysts of Platinum Alloy and Single-Atom Platinum for an Efficient and Durable Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Pt single-atom materials possess an ideal atom economy but suffer from limited intrinsic activity and side reaction of producing H2O2in catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); platinum alloys have higher intrinsic activity but weak stability. Here, we demonstrate that anchoring platinum alloys on single-atom Pt-decorated carbon (Pt-SAC) surmounts their inherent deficiencies, thereby enabling a complete four-electron ORR pathway catalysis with high efficiency and durability. Pt3Co@Pt-SAC demonstrates an exceptional mass and specific activities 1 order of magnitude higher than those of commercial Pt/C. They are durable throughout 50000 cycles, showing only a 10 mV decay in half-wave potential. An in situ Raman analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that Pt3Co core nanocrystals modulate electron structures of the adjacent Pt single atoms to facilitate the intermediate absorption for fast kinetics. The superior durability is attributed to the shielding effect of the Pt-SAC coating, which significantly mitigates the dissolution of Pt3Co cores. The hybridizing strategy might promote the development of highly active and durable ORR catalysts.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.2c04077
Competitive Adsorption: Reducing the Poisoning Effect of Adsorbed Hydroxyl on Ru Single-Atom Site with SnO2 for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2022 The Authors. Angewandte Chemie International Edition published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Ruthenium (Ru) has been theoretically considered a viable alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst due to its fast water dissociation kinetics. However, its strong affinity to the adsorbed hydroxyl (OHad) blocks the active sites, resulting in unsatisfactory performance during the practical HER process. Here, we first reported a competitive adsorption strategy for the construction of SnO2 nanoparticles doped with Ru single-atoms supported on carbon (Ru SAs-SnO2/C) via atomic galvanic replacement. SnO2 was introduced to regulate the strong interaction between Ru and OHad by the competitive adsorption of OHad between Ru and SnO2, which alleviated the poisoning of Ru sites. As a consequence, the Ru SAs-SnO2/C exhibited a low overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (10 mV) and a low Tafel slope of 25 mV dec−1. This approach provides a new avenue to modulate the adsorption strength of active sites and intermediates, which paves the way for the development of highly active electrocatalysts.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202209486
"Sacrificial Template Method to Synthesize Atomically Dispersed Mn Atoms on S, N-Codoped Carbon as a Separator Modifier for Advanced Li-S Batteries","© 2022 American Chemical Society.Efficient and durable electrocatalysts are important for polysulfide conversion in high-performance Li-S batteries. Herein, we report a sacrificial template strategy to synthesize a sulfur/nitrogen-codoped carbon-supported manganese (Mn) single-atom catalyst (Mn/SNC). The synthesis is enabled by fabricating a novel precursor, i.e., cadmium sulfide (CdS) wrapped with Mn ion-impregnated polyporrole (CdS@Mn-PPy), and subsequent pyrolysis. During pyrolysis, the CdS template is decomposed into Cd and S, PPy-derived carbon is doped with N and S, and Mn ions are reduced to Mn atoms, forming Mn-N active sites. The evaporation of Cd atoms/clusters creates abundant pores in the carbon substrate to expose the active sites and facilitate ion transport, and S atoms can form edge C-S-C bonds to improve the activity of Mn-N sites. Benefiting from the above advantages, the Mn/SNC catalyst markedly enhances the performance of Li-S batteries, delivering an initial capacity of 1563.7 mAh g-1 at 0.1C, a capacity decay of only 0.037% per cycle after 1600 cycles at 2C; a capacity of 1045.1 mAh g-1 at a high sulfur loading of 7.44 mg cm-2 at 0.2C, and a capacity retention of 73.1% after 180 cycles. This work provides a strategy that may benefit further the rational design and development of single-atom catalysts for application in renewable energy.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c12114
Hierarchically Porous Three-Dimensional (3D) Carbon Nanorod Networks with a High Content of FeNx Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Efficient, durable, and inexpensive electrocatalysts are recommendable for accelerating the kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction and achieving high performance. Herein, with predesigned hierarchically porous silica nanorods as a hard template, hierarchically macro-bimodal meso/microporous 3D carbon interwoven nanorod networks containing a high content of single-atom FeNx species (Fe/RNC) were prepared by melting of precursors and confined pyrolysis within the pores of the hard template. What distinguishes the use of silica nanorods as a hard template is that it not only provides a porous texture for confined pyrolysis of the precursors but also the interwoven texture of the nanorods gives rise to a macroporous mesh-like morphology. Benefiting from the ultrahigh iron content (5.69 wt %) of the FeNx sites, a 3D porous network configuration with high accessibility of active centers, as well as a high specific surface area of 793 m2g-1, the as-prepared Fe/RNC exhibited superior activity and durability for ORR and zinc-air batteries. For comparison, the catalyst Fe/NC-MCM, which was prepared with a similar procedure but with unimodal mesoporous silica MCM-41 nanoparticles as the hard template, possesses a less porous structure and active accessibility and thus exhibits inferior ORR activity. This work provides an effective design/nanoengineering for electrocatalysts in ORR and zinc-air batteries and will inspire more research on accessibility of active sites in non-noble carbon-based electrocatalysts.",Langmuir,10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c01664
Theoretical inspection of TM-P4C single-atom electrocatalysts: High performance for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions,"© 2022Developing the cost-effective or even bifunctional electrocatalysts for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with industrially relevant activity is highly desired for metal-air batteries at the current stage. Herein, in this work, the catalytic performances of the single transition metal (TM) atom embeds graphene sheet with the tetra-coordinates Phosphorus (TMP4) for ORR and OER are investigated based on the density functional theory method. The results demonstrate that the most promising ORR and OER catalytic activity can be achieved on the CoP4 with the smallest potential gap ΔE and the lowest overpotential of 0.37 and 0.32 eV among all TMP4 systems, respectively, and the catalytic activity is even better than that of the traditional Pt and IrO2 catalysts. Furthermore, the AIMD and phonon dispersion calculations are conducted to confirm the thermodynamics and dynamics stability of CoP4. This work screens out promising candidates for novel graphene-based bifunctional ORR and OER catalysts and offers detailed microscopic insights into the mechanism of OER/ORR, provides a theoretical guidance for the development of further single-atom catalysts.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140853
Highly Efficient Electrochemical CO2Reduction on a Precise Homonuclear Diatomic Fe-Fe Catalyst,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to value-added chemicals offers a promising approach to mitigate net carbon emission but presents challenges for chemistry because of the high energy barrier originating from CO2 activation or product desorption, as well as the limited fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism. Herein, a diatomic electrocatalyst with nitrogen-doped porous carbon-anchored homonuclear Fe2N6 sites was precisely prepared for efficiently reducing CO2 to CO. The catalyst achieves CO Faradic efficiency up to 96.0% at -0.6 V (RHE) and a Tafel slope of only 60 mV dec-1, much superior to the single-atom Fe catalyst. Density functional theory calculations reveal that neighboring Fe-Fe centers in the Fe2N6 site facilitate the CO2 activation process via concurrently bonding the C and O atoms of the CO2 molecule. Meanwhile, the reaction barrier of CO desorption on the Fe2N6 site is decreased by the synergy of the dual Fe center, as the distinct CO-adsorbed configuration of the Fe2N6 site is inclined to uptake a second CO2 molecule. This work contributes fundamental understanding of ECR mechanisms and provides deep insights into the rational design of efficient ECR catalysts.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.2c03149
Modeling the Potential-Dependent Kinetics of CO2 Electroreduction on Single-Nickel Atom Catalysts with Explicit Solvation,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Single-metal atom catalysts in nitrogen-doped graphene supports have attracted growing attention as state-of-the-art CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, theoretical explorations on such systems remain immensely insufficient owing to the complexity in realistic modeling of the solid/liquid interface and the lack of understanding of the potential dependence of the reaction mechanisms and the catalytic nature of active sites. In this work, we develop a methodology of Langmuir adsorption model-derived potential-dependent kinetics (LPD-K) to probe the potential-dependent kinetics of the CO2RR on single-atom electrocatalysts. Using this LPD-K method, we show how to predict the potential-dependent chemistry using a specific example, single-nickel atom nitrogen−graphene catalysts (NiNnC4−n@Gra, n = 1−4). We investigate the reaction mechanisms and energetics at the electrochemical interface using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with fully explicit solvation, in conjunction with thermodynamic integration methods and electrode potential analysis. The effect of the applied electrode potential on the free energetics of the CO2RR on NiNnC4−n@Gra is comprehensively discussed. It is suggested that both reaction energies and barriers for CO2 adsorption and further protonation are approximately linearly correlated with the applied electrode potentials but the slopes are distinctly deviated from 1 eV per volt. Based on the correlations of potential-dependent free energetics and the proposed kinetic model, we predict the onset potentials of the CO2RR under both basic and acidic conditions, which are comparable with the experimental observations. In addition, our findings reveal the structural impact of the catalytic activity of a single-Ni atom catalyst with different coordination environments. In a broad sense, probing the structural origin and thermodynamic CO2RR analysis could inspire the rational design of efficient MNC@Gra-based CO2RR catalysts.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.2c02383
Single Nb atom modified anatase TiO2(110) for efficient electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.We report the theory-guided design of anatase-supported Nb catalysts for electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR). Theoretical calculations predict that Nb atoms deliver multi-functional enhancement toward the NRR when incorporated in an anatase TiO2(110) catalyst: (1) decreasing the band gap and inducing electrons to promote the conductivity of TiO2(110); (2) suppressing the undesired competitive hydrogen evolution reaction; (3) activating the inert Ti sites for N2 adsorption; (4) enabling fast charge transfer between ∗NNH and the TiO2(110) surface; and (5) reducing the energy barrier of the potential-determining ∗N2 → ∗NNH step, further facilitating NH3 formation. As a result, our Nb-TiO2(110) catalyst exhibits superior activity and selectivity for the NRR, which affords an NH3 production rate of about 21.3 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and NH3 faradaic efficiency of ∼9.2% at −0.5 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode).

Triazine organic framework derived Fe single-atom bifunctional electrocatalyst for high performance zinc air batteries,"© 2022Owing to their adjustable local structure and coordination environment, Fe single-metal site electrocatalysts become superior alternatives to the precious metal-based systems for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). However, they often suffer from complicated preparation methods. The optimized conditions hide in a narrow window and require a large amount of screening work. Moreover, the porous support may collapse during high temperature, resulting in dead volume and low atomic usage efficiency. Herein we report a facile build-up of atomically dispersed Fe single metal site (Fe–N–C) derived from Fe-doped thermalized covalent triazine frameworks (TTF) towards bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts. The TTF-derived carbon provides a platform for the formation and uniform dispersion of single-atom Fe–N catalytic centers. A high electrocatalytic behavior towards ORR (E1/2 = 0.891 V) and OER (Ej = 10 = 1.543 V) in alkaline medium is achieved with excellent stability and anti-methanol poisoning activity. Impressively, its metal mass activity is 62 times higher than commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. The Zn-air battery (ZAB) based on the catalyst achieves a high capacity of 783.2 mAh g−1, a low voltage gap of 0.55 V and an outstanding rechargeability of 1650 cycles (∼550 h), placing it as one of the best-performing ZABs.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231583

Herein, a simple and convenient method for synthesizing trimetallic Fe/Co/Zn-ZIF-derived porous carbon as the bifunctional electrocatalyst towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been developed. The optimal trimetallic ZIF-derived carbon material shows a marked ORR catalytic activity with a more positive onset potential (Eo) of 1.010 V and half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.853 V, which is superior to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, it also exhibits the excellent OER performance with lower overpotential of 352 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH than that of RuO2 and the observed Tafel slope of 82 mV dec−1. A rechargeable ZAB assembled with the as-prepared ZIF-derived porous carbon as an air cathode displays the superior performance with a maximum current density of 240.7 mA cm−2 and a peak power density of 156.7 mW cm−2 as well as a specific capacity of 769.13 mAh g−1, much larger than those of ZAB equipped with Pt/C–RuO2.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231723
Rh single atoms/clusters confined in metal sulfide/oxide nanotubes as advanced multifunctional catalysts for green and energy-saving hydrogen productions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, smart strategies are conducted to design advanced multifunctional electrocatalysts: Co3S4/CoOx heterostructured nanosheets-assembled nanotube arrays on 3D framework integrated with single Rh atoms and subnanometer clusters. The catalyst can reach current density of 10 mA cm−2 at low overpotentials of 248.2, and 56.1 mV for oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. The catalyst also shows very low potential of 1.32 V for urea oxidation reaction at 10 mA cm−2. A water electrolyzer that achieves current density of 10 mA cm−2 at small cell voltage of 1.45 V is prepared under action of the developed catalyst. We also conduct urea electrolysis assembled with the catalyst and find that the device requires a cell voltage of only 1.35 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2, proving the great potential of our catalyst for simultaneous energy-saving H2 production and the treatment of urea-rich wastewater.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121430
Rich edge-hosted single-atomic Cu-N4 sites for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction performance,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Single-atom electrocatalysts with metal-nitrogen-carbon (M[sbnd]N[sbnd]C SACs) moieties in carbon support display outstanding electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and have received widespread attentions. Only active sites on the edges of pores in carbon support are electrochemically accessible and contribute to ORR. Herein, we report a combined hydroxyl-functionalized and NH4Cl-assisted etching strategy to effectively promote the yield of edge-hosted Cu SAs. Thus, well-defined SAs with Cu-N4 configuration are generated into the defect of carbonaceous nanospheres (CuSAs@DCSs). Impressively, the obtained SACs renders outstanding electrocatalytic ORR activity with onset, half-wave potentials of 1.02 V, 0.90 V, and extremely high stability, which transcends the noble-metals and most of the previously reported catalysts. When used in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, CuSAs@DCSs achieves ultralong cycle life at the large current density of 10 mA cm−2 (over 260 h) with low charge–discharge potential gap. Our study demonstrates that the creation of abundant micropores enriches the electrochemically accessible SAs, which locate at the edge-defects and are responsible for the remarkable ORR performance.

Atomically dispersed V-N-C catalyst with saturated coordination effect for boosting electrochemical oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Single atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit impressive catalytic activity for various reactions due to low coordination environment and tunable electronic structures, attracting increasing attention. However, it is big challenge to develop transition-metal-based SACs for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with high stability. Bioinspired by the structure and mechanism of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase, we herein demonstrate that saturated coordination could boost ORR activity of atomically dispersed V-N-C catalyst combining DFT prediction and experimental verification. Spontaneous axial OH coordination to V-N-C catalyst in alkaline electrolyte not only optimizes the adsorption interaction for key intermediates to boost ORR activity, but also keeps vanadium atom at the highest valence against Fenton activity to improve the stability. The as-designed catalyst exhibits half-wave potential of 0.858 V vs. RHE for ORR, comparable to the commercial Pt/C benchmark. This work provides a proof-of-concept design of SACs and broadens the horizon of its potential applications.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.136363
Engineering FeN4 active sites onto nitrogen-rich carbon with tubular channels for enhanced oxygen reduction reaction performance,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Nitrogen coordinated Fe single atoms (Fe-Nx SAs) anchored in carbon support is one of the most efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Engineering the microenvironment of Fe-Nx sites to achieve enhanced activity is still challenging. Herein, we theoretically demonstrate that nitrogen dopants in carbon skeletons can optimize the adsorption of ORR intermediates on Fe-N4 sites. Then, we introduce a rational strategy to anchor Fe-N4 sites in nitrogen-rich carbon support with abundant tubular channels (Fe-SAs@NCTCs). Fe-SAs@NCTCs exhibits encouraging ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.91 V in 0.1 M KOH and 0.80 V in 0.1 M HClO4. The assembled rechargeable Zn–air battery presents high power density and operates steadily with a narrow voltage gap of 0.76 V for 650 h. The results verify that the outstanding ORR activity can be attributed to the abundant nitrogen dopant, hierarchical porous structure, and abundant tubular channels.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121464

Surface restructuring in AgCu single-atom alloy catalyst and self-enhanced selectivity toward CO2 reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSingle atom alloy catalysts, consisting of trace amount of isolated solute atoms alloyed into the host matrix, provide a promising approach to tune the electronic structure and performance of bimetallic catalysts for breaking the limits of scaling relationships based on the unique electronic structures. However, the precisely as-synthesized surface usually suffers from surface evolution leading to activity and durability decay. Herein, the understanding of surface restructuring under reaction conditions is of great importance in optimizing catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts. In this work, on account of the surface evolution of Cu in electrochemical reactions and its limited miscibility in Ag, a nanoporous AgCu single atom alloy catalyst with atomic ratio Cu:Ag = 1:110 is fabricated by chemical dealloying process. And a CO2-reduction-induced surface restructuring is achieved upon the well-designed catalyst. Noteworthily, nanoporous AgCu exhibits self-reinforcing selectivity toward CO2 reduction and suppressed hydrogen evolution in parallel with migration of Cu to the surface, although the charge transfer from Ag to Cu results in a strong tendency toward hydrogen evolution at the initial catalytic stage. By combining in situ electrochemical hypersensitive response to surface state with ex situ characterizations, the surface reconstruction is verified to be driven by electrochemical reduction of CO2 rather than hydrogen evolution reaction, and can be modulated by the applied potential. Well-reconstructed nanoporous AgCu facilitates the adsorption of CO2. Electronic effect of the restructuring of Cu enhances CO desorption ability on the surface. Consequently, electronic and geometric effects synergically lead to excellent performances with CO Faradaic efficiency of 97.5%. The insights gained from the reconstruction-induced self-reinforcing behavior of bimetallic electrocatalyst shall offer an avenue to rationally design bimetallic electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140774
Strong electronic coupling between ruthenium single atoms and ultrafine nanoclusters enables economical and effective hydrogen production,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Although Ru-based materials have been recognized as promising electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), further improving the mass activity and guaranteeing the high-throughput H2 production of the catalysts is of vital importance. Herein, Ru single atoms coupling with ultrafine nanoclusters on hierarchical porous N-doped carbon (NMC-RuSA+NC) has been synthesized as economical and effective HER catalysts. Density function theory and the experimental results reveal that the strong electronic coupling effects between Ru single atoms and nanoclusters and unique hierarchical structure enable NMC-RuSA+NC with the ultralow overpotential for achieving 500 mA cm−2 in alkaline and acidic conditions. More importantly, the NMC-RuSA+NC affords a higher mass activity and a lower cost for generating H2 than those of commercial Pt/C, justifiably proving its remarkable advantages for industrial use.

Transition metal anchored on C9N4 as a single-atom catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation: A first-principles study,"© 2022 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.To alleviate the greenhouse effect and maintain the sustainable development, it is of great significance to find an efficient and low-cost catalyst to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and generate formic acid (FA). In this work, based on the first-principles calculation, the catalytic performance of a single transition metal (TM) (TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Ir, Pt, Au, or Hg) atom anchored on C9N4 monolayer (TM@C9N4) for the hydrogenation of CO2 to FA is calculated. The results show that single TM atom doping in C9N4 can form a stable TM@C9N4 structure, and Cu@C9N4 and Co@C9N4 show better catalytic performance in the process of CO2 hydrogenation to FA (the corresponding maximum energy barriers are 0.41 eV and 0.43 eV, respectively). The partial density of states (PDOS), projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP), difference charge density analysis and Bader charge analysis demonstrate that the TM atom plays an important role in the reaction. The strong interaction between the 3d orbitals of the TM atom and the non-bonding orbitals (1π g) of CO2 allows the reaction to proceed under mild conditions. In general, our results show that Cu@C9N4 and Co@C9N4 are a promising single-atom catalyst and can be used as the non-precious metals electrocatalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid.",Chinese Physics B,10.1088/1674-1056/ac6158
Hydrogen evolution reaction activity obtained using platinum single atoms on TiO2 nanosheets modified with graphene,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Design and engineering of efficient electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are essential in the development of renewable energy conversion and storage. Single atomic electrocatalysts (SACs), including platinum (Pt) SACs, play a key role in catalysis owing to the ~ 100% utilization of the desired atom thus minimizing the usage of noble metals. Herein, we show a facile method to atomically anchor Pt atoms on TiO2 nanosheets modified with graphene (Pt@TiO2/NSG with an ultralow Pt loading of 1.61 wt%). The atomic dispersion of Pt on TiO2/NSG structure was confirmed by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and was anchored by numerous surface functional groups on abundant exposed basal planes in TiO2/NSG heterostructure. Benefiting from the synergetic effect due to the interaction between active centers, Pt SACs, and the TiO2/NSG substrate, the Pt@TiO2/NSG electrocatalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity toward HER in an acidic electrolyte, with a low overpotential of 38 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec, and a decent durability for the 1000th cycles of HER polarization curve has only 1 mV shift, which is even better than those of commercial Pt/C benchmark electrocatalysts.

Surface Co-Modification of Halide Anions and Potassium Cations Promotes High-Rate CO2-to-Ethanol Electrosynthesis,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The high-rate electrochemical CO2 conversion to ethanol with high partial current density is attractive but challenging, which requires competing with other reduction products as well as hydrogen evolution. This work demonstrates the in situ reconstruction of KCuF3 perovskite under CO2 electroreduction conditions to fabricate a surface fluorine-bonded, single-potassium-atom-modified Cu(111) nanocrystal (K–F–Cu–CO2). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the co-modification of both F and K atoms on the Cu(111) surface can promote the ethanol pathway via stabilization of the C-O bond and selective hydrogenation of the C=C bond in the CH2=CHO* intermediate, while the single modification of either F or K is less effective. The K–F–Cu–CO2 electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding CO2-to-ethanol partial current density of 423 ± 30 mA cm−2 with the corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 52.9 ± 3.7%, and a high electrochemical stability at large current densities, thus suggesting an attractive means of surface co-modification of halide anions and alkali-metal cations on Cu catalysts for high-rate CO2-to-ethanol electrosynthesis.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202204476
Computational screening of TMN4 based graphene-like BC6N for CO2 electroreduction to C1 hydrocarbon products,"© 2022Graphene-like BC6N monolayers supported with TMN4 (TM = Sc ∼ Zn) (TMN4@BC6N) centers, which can provide various coordination environment, was studied to explore its performance as efficient CO2RR catalysts through density functional theory (DFT). High-throughput screening based on structural stability and reaction pathways identified the most promising catalyst candidates. According to the optimal path and overpotential analysis, five TMN4@BC6N (TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Zn) systems with low limiting potentials exhibit high CO2RR activity towards C1 products. The potential origin of electrocatalytic performance shows the descriptors of Eb (*CO) and Eb (*OH) act as performance indicators. It is revealed that coordination environment with different charge near the TMN4 active center can modulate the catalytic activity of the catalyst.

Coordination Symmetry Breaking of Single-Atom Catalysts for Robust and Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Nitrate electrocatalytic reduction (NO3RR) for ammonia production is a promising strategy to close the N-cycle from nitration contamination, as well as an alternative to the Haber–Bosch process with less energy consumption and carbon dioxide release. However, current long-term stability of NO3RR catalysts is usually tens of hours, far from the requirements for industrialization. Here, symmetry-broken Cusingle-atom catalysts are designed, and the catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than 2000 h, while an average ammonia production rate of 27.84 mg h−1 cm−2 at an industrial level current density of 366 mA cm−2 is achieved, obtaining a good balance between catalytic activity and long-term stability. Coordination symmetry breaking is achieved by embedding one Cu atom in graphene nanosheets with two N and two O atoms in the cis-configuration, effectively lowering the coordination symmetry, rendering the active site more polar, and accumulating more NO3− near the electrocatalyst surface. Additionally, the cis-coordination splits the Cu 3d orbitals, which generates an orbital-symmetry-matched π-complex of the key intermediate *ONH and reduces the energy barrier, compared with the σ-complex generated with other catalysts. These results reveal the critical role of coordination symmetry in single-atom catalysts, prompting the design of more coordination-symmetry-broken electrocatalysts toward possible industrialization.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202205767

Advanced Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom catalysts (SACs), on account of their outstanding catalytic potential, are currently emerging as high-performance materials in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Constructing a strong interaction between the single atom and its supporting matrix plays a pivotal role. Herein, Ti3C2Tx-MXene-supported Ni SACs are reported by using a self-reduction strategy via the assistance of rich Ti vacancies on the Ti3C2Tx MXene surface, which act as the trap and anchor sites for individual Ni atoms. The constructed Ni SACs supported by the Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ni SACs/Ti3C2Tx) show an ultralow onset potential of −0.03 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and an exceptional operational stability toward the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Density functional theory calculations suggest a strong coupling of the Ni single atoms and their surrounding C atoms, which optimizes the electronic density of states, increasing the adsorption energy and decreasing the reaction activation energy, thus boosting the electrochemical activity.

Manipulating the electronic structure of electrocatalysts to optimize the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing intermediates during the 4e− ORR offers a practical route toward improving ORR kinetics. Herein, we designed a novel ORR electrocatalyst containing Co single atoms and nanoparticles supported by carbon dots-derived carbon nanoflowers (Co SAs/NPs CNF). Co SAs/NPs CNF possessed a very high ORR activity (E1/2 of the Co SAs/NPs CNF catalyst is 0.83 V (vs. RHE)), and outstanding catalytic performance and stability when used as the air-electrode catalyst in rechargeable ZABs (152.32 mW cm−2, 1000.58 mWh gZn−1, and over 1300 cycles at a current density of 5 mA cm−2). The Co SAs and Co NPs cooperated to improve electron and proton transfer processes during ORR. Theoretical calculations revealed that the presence of adjacent Co NPs optimized the electronic structure of the isolated Co-N4 sites, significantly lowering the energy barriers for the rate-determining step in ORR (adsorption of *OOH) and thereby delivering outstanding ORR performance. This work reveals that the combination of supported single-atom sites and metal nanoparticles can be highly beneficial for ORR electrocatalysis, outperforming catalysts containing only Co SAs or Co NPs.",Chinese Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/S1872-2067(22)64146-9
Exposing Single Ni Atoms in Hollow S/N-Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for clean energy and fuel conversion. Herein, the facile preparation of Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N-doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N-CMF) as efficient catalysts for OER through pyrolysis of designed CdS-NiSx/polyacrylonitrile composite fibers is reported. Specifically, CdS provides the sulfur source for the doping of polyacrylonitrile-derived carbon matrix and simultaneously creates the hollow macroporous structure, while NiSx is first reduced to nanoparticles and finally evolves into single Ni atoms through the atom migration-trapping strategy. Benefiting from the abundantly exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N-CMF electrocatalysts deliver outstanding activity and stability for OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 285 mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a small Tafel slope of 50.8 mV dec−1.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202203442
Tuning the Cobalt–Platinum Alloy Regulating Single-Atom Platinum for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Designing atomically dispersed metal catalysts for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a promising strategy to efficiently convert electrical energy to chemical fuels. This strategy, however, still faces the challenge of finding a catalyst with high activity and long-term durability. Here, single-atom platinum and cobalt–platinum-alloy nanocrystals in a nitrogen-doped porous-carbon framework (CoPt-PtSA/NDPCF) is confined. The electrocatalyst exhibits ultralow overpotentials under both alkaline and acidic conditions at a high current density of −300 mA cm−2 and excellent long-term durability up to 100 h or 10 000 cycles, which are attributed to the synergetic effects of PtSA and tuning of the CoPt alloy in the NDPCF. First-principles calculations suggested that PtSA aided by the CoPt alloy has high d-band occupation for promoting the reaction kinetics. This study opens a new avenue for designing heterostructures with the synergic effects of single metal atoms and metal alloys with outstanding performance in the HER.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202205920
Single-atomic Mn sites coupled with Fe3C nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon matrixes derived from bimetallic Mn/Fe polyphthalocyanine conjugated polymer networks for accelerating electrocatalytic oxygen reduction,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.The construction of robust coupling catalysts for accelerating electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) through the modulation of the electronic structure and local atomic configuration is critical but remains challenging. Herein, we report a facile and effective isolation-polymerization-pyrolysis (IPP) strategy for high-precision synthesis of single-atomic Mn sites coupled with Fe3C nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped porous carbon matrixes (Mn SAs/Fe3C NPs@NPC) catalyst derived from predesigned bimetallic Fe/Mn polyphthalocyanine (FeMn-BPPc) conjugated polymer networks by solid-phase reaction approach. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between the single-atomic Mn-N4 sites and Fe3C NPs as well as the confinement effect of NPC, the Mn SAs/Fe3C NPs@NPC catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for ORR. The assembled Zn-air battery displayed larger power density of 186 mW·cm−2 than that of Pt/C + Ir/C-based battery. It also exhibits excellent stability without obvious voltage change after 106 cycles with 36 h. Combing in-situ Raman spectra with in-situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) characterization results indicated that the Mn-N4 site as an active site for the O2 adsorption-activation process, which effectively facilitates the generation of key *OOH intermediates and *OH desorption to promote the multielectron reaction kinetics. Theoretical calculation reveals that the excellent electrocatalytic performance originates from the charge redistribution and the d orbital shift resulting from Mn-Fe bond, which buffers the activity of ORR through the electron reservoir capable of electron donation or releasing. This work paves a novel IPP strategy for constructing high-performance coupling electrocatalyst towards the ORR for energy conversion devices.

Pt Single Atom Electrocatalysts at Graphene Edges for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Graphene edges exhibit a highly localized density of states that result in increased reactivity compared to its basal plane. However, exploiting this increased reactivity to anchor and tune the electronic states of single atom catalysts (SACs) remains elusive. To investigate this, a method to anchor Pt SACs with ultra-low mass loadings at the edges of edge-rich vertically aligned graphene (as low as 0.71 µg Pt cm–2) is developed. Angle-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density-functional theory calculations reveal that edge-anchored Pt SACs has a robust coupling with the π-electrons of graphene. This interaction results in a higher occupancy of the Pt 5d orbital, shifting the d-band center toward the Fermi level, improving the adsorption of *H for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Pt primarily coordinated to the graphene edge shows improved alkaline HER performance compared to Pt coordinated in mixed environments (turnover frequencies of 22.6 and 10.9 s–1 at an overpotential of 150 mV, respectively). This work demonstrates an effective route to engineering the coordination environment of Pt SACs by using the graphene edge for enhanced energy conversion reactions.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202203067
High-throughput identification of highly active and selective single-atom catalysts for electrochemical ammonia synthesis through nitrate reduction,"© 2022The highly selective and active nitrate-to-ammonia electrochemical conversion (NO3 reduction reaction [NO3RR]) can be an appealing and supplementary alternative to the Haber-Bosch process. It also opens up a new idea for addressing nitrate pollution. Previous study demonstrated that FeN4 single-atom catalyst (SAC) indicates excellent NO3RR performance. Nonetheless, the mechanism that triggers the electrocatalytic NO3RR remains unclear. The feasibility of NO3RR over various SACs is verified in this study via high-throughput density functional theory calculations with the single transition metal (TM) atom coordinated with four nitrogen atoms supported on graphene as the example. We conducted a comprehensive screening of TM SAC candidates for stability, NO3− adsorption strength, catalytic activity, and selectivity. Results reveal that the most promising candidate among the 23 TM SACs is Os SAC with a low limiting potential of − 0.42 V. Os SAC is better than Fe SAC with a limiting potential of −0.53 V because of the strong interaction between the oxygen of NO3− species and Os atom. The origin of high NO3RR activity of Os SAC is explained by its inner electronic structure of the strong hybridization of the Os atom and NO3− caused by the increasing charge transfer from TM atom to NO3−, leading to the suitable NO3− adsorption. This research provides a fundamental insight of discovering novel NO3RR catalysts and may provide a motivating drive for the creation of effective ammonia electrocatalysts for further experimental investigation.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107517
Single-atom Fe-N5 catalyst for high-performance zinc-air batteries,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Developing innovative and efficient non-precious-metal-group (non-PMG) electrocatalysts is crucial for the wide use of zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a single-atom catalyst (termed as Fe-N-C/rGO SAC) with unique five N-coordinated Fe (Fe-N5) centers is prepared by pyrolyzing the composite of zeolitic-imidazolate-frameworks-8 (ZIF-8) and graphene oxide (GO). Specifically, the individual Fe site is stabilized by four equatorial and one axial N atoms donated by the N-doped carbon matrix and imidazole ring, respectively, thus forming an asymmetric electron depletion zone over the metal center, which can effectively promote the generation of reactive intermediates and accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes for ZABs. The rechargeable liquid ZAB with Fe-N-C/rGO catalyst exhibits an extremely high energy density (928.25 Wh·kg−1), a remarkable peak power density (107.12 mW·cm−2), and a long cycle life (400 h). Additionally, the corresponding flexible solid-state ZAB displays superior foldability and remarkable cycling stability. This work provides both experimental and theoretical guidance for rational design of non-PMG electrocatalyst-driven ZABs.

Sulfur coordination engineering of molybdenum single-atom for dual-functional oxygen reduction/evolution catalysis,"© 2022Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis are required in metal-air batteries and an efficient dual-functional single-atom catalyst (SAC) is still lacking. This is partly because of the limited synthesis strategies to modify the coordination environment of metal centers in SACs. Herein, we report a genetic strategy, transformation from thiometallate anions in the precursor to metal-sulfur bonding in carbon, producing hollow-sphere-structured Mo SAC with O/N/S co-coordination as an efficient ORR/OER dual-functional catalyst. The MoS42−-doped polydopamine have O/S co-coordination for Mo, which converts into S/O/N co-coordination in carbon during pyrolysis. We established that coordination engineering, specifically S coordination, could boost the ORR catalysis of Mo SAC. The low ORR half-wave potential (E1/2) and small Tafel slope are among the best of Mo-based non-noble metal catalysts. The OER overpotential of 303 mV at 10 mA cm−2 is significantly lower than that of commercial IrO2, and Pt/C. Assembled Zn-air batteries can work steadily for 90 h without significant voltage decay. Our strategy can be extended to the synthesis of other group-V and group-VI metal hollow SACs with an S coordination, such as W.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.05.015
Rational design of bimetallic atoms supported on C3N monolayer to break the linear relations for efficient electrochemical nitrogen reduction,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Linear relations between the adsorption free energies of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) intermediates limit the catalytic activity of single atom catalysts (SACs) to reach the optimal region. Significant improvements in NRR activity require the balance of binding strength of reaction intermediates. Herein, we have investigated the C3N-supported monometallic (M/C3N) and bimetallic (M1M2/C3N) atoms for the electrochemical NRR by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results show that this linear relation does exist for SACs because all the intermediates bind to the same site on M/C3N. But the synergistic effect of the two atoms in M1M2/C3N can create a more flexible adsorption site for intermediates, which results in the decoupling of adsorption free energies of key intermediates. Subsequently, the fundamental limitation of scaling relations on limiting potentials is broken through. Most notably, the optimal limiting potential is increased from −0.63 V for M/C3N to −0.20 V for M1M2/C3N. In addition, the presence of bimetallic atoms can also effectively inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as improve the stability of the catalysts. This study proposes that the introduction of bimetallic atoms into C3N is beneficial to break the linear relations and develop efficient NRR electrocatalysts.

Metal-organic framework-derived Co nanoparticles and single atoms as efficient electrocatalyst for pH universal hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Hydrogen release through water splitting is essential for reducing carbon emissions and promoting the hydrogen economy. One of the crucial challenges for industrial applications of water electrolysis is the manufacture of electrocatalysts which can reduce the kinetic energy barrier of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Loading transition metal (TM) nanoparticles (NPs) or single atoms (SAs) into heteroatom-doped carbon materials (HCMs) is an effective method to improve electrochemical activity and stability. To this end, we synthesized N-doped porous carbon (NC) encapsulated Co NPs and isolated Co SA nanocatalysts (denoted as Co NPs@SAs-NC) using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as sacrificial precursors. The Co NPs@SAs-NC nanocatalysts displayed outstanding HER activity with a 110 mV overpotential in 1 M KOH, 47 mV overpotential in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 171 mV in 0.5 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to reach a current density of 10 mA·cm−2. In addition, the mechanism of the synergistic effect of Co NPs, Co SAs and N species was investigated in-depth using in situ shielding experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Highly active platinum single-atom catalyst grafted onto 3D carbon cloth support for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Platinum single-atom catalysts (PtSACs) on 3D support are emerging as the new frontier in catalysis due to their atom-economy, outstanding performance, and the advantage to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Here we report on a simple, single-step electrochemical grafting attachment of a metal-selective ligand, 2,6:2′,2″-terpyridine, and the synthesis of platinum single-atom electrocatalyst via metal uptake from aqueous salt solution. At an ultra-low loading of 0.26 ± 0.02 μg•cm−2 of platinum, the single-atom catalysts supported on porous 3D carbon cloth electrode via chemical bonding revealed higher mass activity ratios, up to 83.0 at η = 50 mV/RHE, compared to the commercial catalyst 20 % Pt/C. Using hydrogen binding energy as the descriptor for efficiency, density functional theory calculations show that promoting hydrogen evolution using terpyridine-Pt proceeds when the catalyst is in a 2+ charge state and with a single hydroxy co-ligand attached to Pt catalytic center. Calculations predict an HER overpotential of about 0.28 V. The electro-grafted terpyridine ligand proved to act as effective scavenger for leached platinum from the counter electrode during extended operational hours. The method to make the PtSAC is facile, non-hazardous and versatile without involving any elaborate pre- and/or post-treatment steps and, the cost of the added platinum to the ligand is only 0.1 US$ m−2.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153480
Derived from Diaryl-λ3-Iodane-Containing Polyoxometalate: Iodine-Doped Molybdenum Carbide for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Among the schemes to improve the efficiency of electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), molybdenum carbides are seen as suitable candidates to replace noble metal electrocatalysts because of their Pt-like d-band center and proper adsorption of intermediate hydrogen species (Hads). Iodine is identified to form I−Hads bond when used as a single-atom electrocatalyst of HER, thereby improving the performance. However, there is no report of combining iodine atoms with molybdenum carbides. We successfully designed a polyoxomolybdate-based precursor molecule which included octamolybdate anions and iodonium cations. After pyrolysis treatment, iodine-doped molybdenum carbide nanocomposite was obtained and exhibited enhanced HER property. This work can verify that iodine atoms can synergistically improve the electrochemical performance of transitional metal nanocomposites, and provide a new insight for the design of advanced HER electrocatalysts.",Journal of Cluster Science,10.1007/s10876-021-02155-9
Theoretical and Experimental Understanding of Metal Single-Atom Electrocatalysts for Accelerating the Electrochemical Reaction of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Metal single-atom materials have attracted tremendous attention in the research field of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries because they can effectively improve the reaction kinetics of sulfur cathodes. However, it is still difficult to determine the best metal single-atom catalyst for Li-S batteries, due to the lack of a unified measurement and evaluation method. Herein, a series of metal single-atom- A nd nitrogen-doped graphene materials (M-NG, M = Fe, Co, Ni, Ir, Ru) have been prepared as the catalysts for promoting the reaction kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction process. Using rotating disk electrode measurements and density functional theory-based theoretical calculations, Ni-NG was screened out to be the best catalyst. It is found that Ni-NG materials can provide a kinetically favorable pathway for the reversible conversion of polysulfide conversion, thus increasing the utilization of sulfur. By coating the Ni-NG materials on the separator as a multifunctional interlayer, a commercially available sulfur cathode presents a stable specific capacity of 701.8 mAh g-1 at a current rate of 0.5C over 400 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading of 3.8 mg cm-2, a high areal capacity of 4.58 mAh cm-2 can be achieved. This work will provide a fundamental understanding of efficient single-atom catalyst materials for Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c09430
Anchoring Bimetal Single Atoms and Alloys on N-Doping-Carbon Nanofiber Networks for an Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction and Zinc-Air Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) play a central role in fuel cells and zinc-air batteries. Bimetal single atoms and nanoparticle hybrids are emerging ORR electrocatalysts, superior to the most exploited unary metal single-atom catalysts (SACs). Here, we report bimetal SAC-based nanofiber networks of Co3Fe7@Co/Fe-SAC for efficient ORR electrocatalysis and zinc-air batteries. A facile and easy-to-scale-up process is developed, and the versatility is validated in three hybrids. Strong electronic interaction is revealed between bimetal single atoms and alloy nanoparticles, leading to improved catalytic performances for ORR. Specifically, the Co3Fe7@Co/Fe-SAC hybrids exhibit a half-wave potential of 0.841 V in a basic electrolyte, comparable to the Pt/C electrocatalyst. Assembled in a zinc-air battery, a Co3Fe7@Co/Fe-SAC hybrid-based cell demonstrates a power density 1.8 times higher than the benchmark Pt/C-IrO2-based one, and it is stable for 150 cycles galvanostatic charge/discharge. The superior device performance is attributed to the appealing intrinsic activity, the carbon shielding effect for anti-leaching, and the hierarchical porous networks for large accessibility of active sites and favorable mass transport. Theoretical calculations suggest that alloy nanoparticles significantly improved the intrinsic catalytic activity of Fe single-atom sites at the expense of slightly lowering the activity of Co single-atom sites. This work presents a versatile process for the mass production of efficient composite electrocatalysts and highlights the power of bimetal single-atom-based hybrids and hierarchically porous structures for ORR device performances.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c09271
ML-guided design and screening of chalcogenide catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCTransition metal chalcogenides are regarded as the promising electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, based on the larger chemical composition space of transition-metal single atom and chalcogenides, the design and screening of excellent HER electrocatalysts remain the challenges. Herein, a machine learning (ML) model was proposed to predict the HER performance of single-atom chalcogenide catalysts, and used to screen the excellent electrocatalysts by combining with density functional theory calculations. The results show that the ML model can predict the HER catalytic activity well. The band gap of support materials is identified as the most important descriptor of single-atom chalcogenide catalysts for HER. Sn@CoS and Ni@ZnS exhibit excellent catalytic activity towards HER, and even outperform the current most efficient Pt catalysts. The hydrogen adsorption free energies of Sn@CoS and Ni@ZnS are 0.04 eV and −0.05 eV, respectively. Both Heyrovsky and Tafel reaction mechanisms are responsible for the HER of Ni@ZnS catalyst. The HER of Sn@CoS catalyst is mainly controlled by the Heyrovsky mechanism. Sn@CoS and Ni@ZnS are considered as the promising electrocatalysts for the HER. This study can provide a competitive tool to predict the activity trends and to accelerate the catalyst design and screening for other catalytic reactions.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.056
Atomically dispersed Co in a cross-channel hierarchical carbon-based electrocatalyst for high-performance oxygen reduction in Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Rational design of the metal active sites and triple-phase interfaces is essential to enhance the catalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of single atom catalysts (SACs). Yet the exposure and intrinsic activity of the atomic metal sites are still not sufficient and the mass transfer process is also not well optimized. Here, a novel dual-template strategy is created to construct a cross-channel hierarchical CoSA@NPC electrocatalyst with abundant Co-N4 sites, topological carbon defects, and mass-transfer channels. Compared with NI-NPC (no-ice template) and NS-NPC (no-silica template), CoSA@NPC has 7 times higher electrochemical surface area and 11 times higher intrinsic activity in the alkaline medium. The CoSA@NPC based Zn-air battery achieves a high specific capacity of 905 mA h g−1 and maintains superb stability even after 350 hours. Moreover, the results of theoretical calculations prove that abundant defects can effectively optimize the adsorption of Co-N4 active sites on oxygen intermediates, leading to better catalytic activity than pure Co-N4 sites.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta05777h
Modulation of Ligand Fields in a Single-Atom Site by the Molten Salt Strategy for Enhanced Oxygen Bifunctional Activity for Zinc-Air Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Achieving full utilization of active sites and optimization of the electronic structure of metal centers is the key to improving the intrinsic activity of single-atom catalysts (SACs) but still remains a challenge to date. Herein, a versatile molten salt-assisted pyrolysis strategy was developed to construct ultrathin, porous carbon nanosheets supported Co SACs. Molten salts are capable of inducing the formation of a Co single-atom and porous graphene-like carbon, which facilitates full exposure of the active center and simultaneously endows the Co SACs with abundant defective Co-N4configurations. The reported Co SACs deliver an excellent bifunctional activity and good stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, metal-air batteries (MABs) assembled with the Co SACs as air electrode also deliver excellent performance with high power densities of 160 mW·cm-2, large capacities of 760 mAh·g-1, and superior long-term charge/discharge stability, outperforming those of commercial Pt/C+RuO2. DFT theoretical calculation results show that the defects in the second coordination shell (CS) of Co SACs promote desorption of the OH∗ intermediate for the ORR and facilitate deprotonation of OH∗ for the OER, which can serve as the favorable active site for oxygen bifunctional catalysts. Our work provides an efficient strategy for the preparation of SACs with fully exposed active centers and optimized electronic structures.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.2c01748
Atomically Isolated Nickel-Nitrogen-Carbon Electrocatalysts Derived by the Utilization of Mg2+ions as Spacers in Bimetallic Ni/Mg-Metal-Organic Framework Precursors for Boosting the Electroreduction of CO2,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Electrochemical CO2reduction (CO2R) is a promising avenue for the conversion of CO2into fuels and beneficial chemicals. Significant efforts have been devoted to the development of active and selective electrocatalysts for CO2R. Atomically dispersed transition metal electrocatalysts have recently attracted consideration for CO2R due to their unique electronic and structural properties that can impart good catalytic performance and high active metal utilization. Among different precursors used for preparing these catalysts, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been utilized as templates for generating atomically dispersed transition metal active sites as they provide well-defined structures that contain transition metals isolated from each other by organic ligands, along with high surface areas. However, maintaining the isolation of the transition metal species, achieving high surface concentrations of active sites, and imparting porosity during the high-temperature heat treatment of MOFs used during synthesis remain a challenge. In this report, Mg2+ions have been employed as spacers in a bimetallic metal-organic framework (NiMg-MOF-74) to assist in preventing the coalescence of the Ni atoms into Ni-based particles during heat treatment, which combined with the use of urea as a nitrogen source resulted in the formation of isolated Ni-Nx/C active sites. Our findings demonstrated that Mg2+ions play a crucial role in extending the distance between the adjacent Ni sites in the precursor structure and generating atomically isolated Ni sites. On the contrary, the utilization of Mg-free Ni-MOF-74 led to the formation of metallic Ni particles embedded in a carbon nanotube-based structure. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of pyrolysis temperature on the produced catalyst morphology. The generation of isolated Ni-Nx/C sites was promoted at higher pyrolysis temperatures (900 °C), while Ni-based particles were predominantly formed at a lower temperature (700 °C). The optimized atomically dispersed Ni-N-C catalyst exhibited excellent selectivity toward CO with a Faradaic efficiency of ∼90% and a current density of -4.2 mA/cm2at -0.76 V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.2c00944
Electrochemical CO2Reduction over Metal-/Nitrogen-Doped Graphene Single-Atom Catalysts Modeled Using the Grand-Canonical Density Functional Theory,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Renewably driven, electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into value-added products is expected to be a critical tool in global decarbonization. However, theoretical studies based on the computational hydrogen electrode largely ignore the nonlinear effects of the applied potential on the calculated results, leading to inaccurate predictions of catalytic behavior or mechanistic pathways. Here, we use grand canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT) to model electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) over metal- and nitrogen-doped graphene catalysts (MNCs) and explicitly include the effects of the applied potential. We used GC-DFT to compute the CO2 to CO reaction intermediate energies at -0.3, -0.7, and -1.2 VSHE catalyzed by MNCs each doped with 1 of the 10 3d block metals coordinated by four pyridinic nitrogen atoms. Our results predict that Sc-, Ti-, Co-, Cu-, and Zn-N4Cs effectively catalyze CO2R at moderate to large reducing potentials (-0.7 to -1.2 VSHE). ZnN4C is a particularly promising electrocatalyst for CO2R to CO both at low and moderate applied potentials based on our thermodynamic analysis. Our findings also explain the observed pH independence of CO production over FeN4C and predict that the rate-determining step of CO2R over FeN4C is not*CO2- formation but rather*CO desorption. Additionally, the GC-DFT-computed density of states analysis illustrates how the electronic states of MNCs and adsorbates change non-uniformly with applied potential, resulting in a significantly increased*CO2- stability relative to other intermediates and demonstrating that the formation of the adsorbed*CO2- anion is critical to CO2R activation. This work demonstrates how GC-DFT paves the way for physically realistic and accurate theoretical simulations of reacting electrochemical systems.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.2c01832
The effect of grain boundary in hexagonal boron nitride on catalytic activity of nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Designing high-efficiency electrocatalysts is of great significance to produce ammonia via electroreduction reaction of nitrogen (NRR). To this end, grain boundary catalysis (GBC) has emerged as a promising strategy experimentally. Herein, based on first principles calculations, we modeled the grain boundary (GB) structures of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), then 12 transition metal atoms (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, and Rh) were anchored on the GB structures to construct single-atom catalysts, the most ideal overpotential of NRR is as low as 0.13 V for Mo adatoms on GB. Additionally, more sophisticated situations in regard to h-BN GB were considered, meanwhile electronic structure analysis was also conducted. We found that, the configuration and density of GB can hardly influence the catalytic activity at GB, while the coordinated B bonded with Mo strongly modified the spin states and the bonding strengths within certain intermediates, leading to this excellent NRR catalytic activity. This work not only provides a new strategy for the development of highly efficient and stable NRR electrocatalysts, but also enhances the understanding on the origin of GBC.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153468
Ligands dependent electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction performance in d-π conjugated molecules,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The coordination environment of metal atoms in single-atom catalysts (SACs) has a greater impact on the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts. However, the influence mechanism of interacting ligands on the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) process is still insufficient. Herein, by means of large-scale density functional theory (DFT) computations, the effect of organic ligands on the NRR process is investigated in-depth using half organometallic sandwich molecular SACs, i.e. TMBzs and TMCps (Bz = benzene, Cp = cyclopentadienyl, and TM = transition metal). The results revealed that the NRR performance of all the systems is highly dependent on the choice of d-π interaction within the TM-Ligand complexes. Compared with TMBzs, the TMCps exhibit outstanding NRR activity and significantly suppress HER. Among 16 candidates, CrCp and MnBz are the most promising candidates with an ultra-low limiting potential of −0.29 V and −0.37 V via consecutive mechanism, respectively. Moreover, the systems with higher spin polarizations have better NRR activity. The work provides new insight into the NRR to molecular SACs with different organic ligands.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153338
Transition metal atoms anchored on nitrogen-doped α-arsenene as efficient electrocatalysts for nitrogen electroreduction reaction,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCElectrocatalytic reduction of N2 to NH3 under ambient conditions, inspired by biological nitrogen fixation, is a new approach to address the current energy shortage crisis. As a result, developing efficient and low-cost catalysts is critical. The catalytic activity, catalytic mechanism, and selectivity of α-arsenene (α-Ars) catalysts anchored with various transition metal atoms and doped with different numbers of N atom were investigated for N2 reduction reaction (NRR) in this paper. Results reveal that compared with WN3-α-Ars which is coordinated with three N atoms, asym-WN2As-α-Ars that coordinated with two N atoms not only exhibits high catalytic activity (UL = −0.36 V), but can also successfully suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is manifested that reducing the number of coordination atoms can promote the selectivity of the transition metal (TM) loaded N-doped arsenene catalysts. Furthermore, activity origin analyses show both the charge on ∗N–NH and φ form volcano-type relationship with the limiting potential. The active center of the catalyst, which acts as the charge transporter and has the moderate ability to retrieve charges, is the most efficient in NRR. Overall, this research creates high performance NRR catalysts by varying the number of coordinating N atoms, which provides a novel idea for the development of new NRR catalysts.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.06.305
Screening and Investigation of a Single Transition Metal Atom Dispersed on 2D WS2as an Effective Electrocatalyst for Nitrogen Fixation: A Computational Study,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Recently, the emergence of single-atom catalysts with excellent catalytic performance has brought new vitality to the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). In this work, transition metal (TM) atoms supported on two-dimensional defect-free WS2 as electrocatalysts for NRR are systematically explored by first-principles calculations and the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model. A three-step strategy is designed to screen a series of non-noble TM atoms (TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ti, V, Zr, Hf, Ta, W, Mo). Our results show that the Mo atom adsorbed on WS2 (Mo@WS2) has the best catalytic performance. The Gibbs free-energy diagram reveals that the overpotential is only 0.36 V for Mo@WS2 as NRR along the enzymatic reaction path. The excellent catalytic performance comes from the charge transfer between Mo@WS2 and nitrogen molecules. In addition, the preferential adsorption of nitrogen molecules relative to hydrogen atoms on the catalyst effectively inhibits the hydrogen reduction reaction, which proves the selectivity of NRR. The relatively low limiting potential and good selectivity make Mo@WS2 a promising candidate in the field of the NRR electrocatalyst. Our work reveals that isolated TM atoms dispersed on WS2 to form the TMS3 group are conducive to catalyzing NRR.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c02969
Spin State as a Participator for Demetalation Durability and Activity of Fe-N-C Electrocatalysts,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.While pyrolyzed Fe-N-C single-atom materials have exhibited encouraging oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in proton exchange fuel cells (PEFCs), their activity origin remains a puzzle and their operando degradation greatly restricts practical applications. A major problem lies in that the spin state of the active center has been largely neglected. Herein, we systematically examined the effect of spin state on the demetalation durability and ORR activity of Fe-N-C electrocatalysts, where two kinds of FeN4clusters, pyridinic-type FeN4C10and pyrrolic-type FeN4C12, are considered. The computed Pourbaix diagrams and catalytic activity indicate that the low-spin pyridinic-type FeN4with OH modification [OH-Fe(II)N4C10(S = 0)] and the medium-spin pyridinic-type FeN4with O2modification [O2-Fe(II)N4C10(S = 1)] have excellent acid durability and high activity toward ORR. Particularly, the thermodynamic limiting potential (0.91 V) predicted on [OH-Fe(II)N4C10(S = 0)] shows great agreement with the experimentally confirmed ones ranging from 0.86 to 0.96 VRHE. The high-spin pyrrolic-type OH-Fe(III)N4C12(S = 5/2) also exhibits impressive 4e-ORR activity but has poor stability in acids. The feature importance analysis showed that the catalytic activity and the adsorption strength of oxygenated intermediates are highly correlated with the intrinsic charges and electronic spin moments of the catalytic center. Furthermore, we found that the applied potential may induce a spin crossover in the active center since each spin state responds differently to the electric field. Our studies advance the understanding of the fundamentals of the FeN4structure-activity correlation and aid the rational design of highly active and stable Fe-N-C electrocatalysts.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c03518
Doping of the Mn vacancy of Mn2B2 with a single different transition metal atom as the dual-function electrocatalyst,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The design of efficient electrocatalysts is essential to enhance the performance of rechargeable metal-air cells, renewable fuel cells and overall water splitting. Based on this, how to improve the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) becomes self-evident. Currently, single atom catalysts (SACs) are widely used as structural design models for the OER, ORR and HER because of the single active site and maximum metal atom utilization, but significant challenges remain. Herein, the catalytic properties of the OER, ORR and HER with a single metal atom as the active site are discussed through first-principles calculations by introducing a single metal atom in the Mn vacancy of Mn2B2 (TM@Mn2B2, TM = Au, Ag, Co, Cd, Cu, Ir, Pd, Ni, Rh, Ru and Pt). The results show that Ni@Mn2B2 is suitable as a dual-function electrocatalyst for the OER/ORR with overpotentials of 0.38 V and 0.37 V, which are lower than those of the OER overpotential of RuO2/IrO2 (0.42 V/0.56 V) and the ORR overpotential of Pt (0.45 V). Meanwhile, Pt@Mn2B2 is available as an OER/HER dual-function electrocatalyst for overall water splitting with a lower overpotential of OER (0.45 V) and lower |ΔGH| (-0.15eV) under 1/4 hydrogen coverage for the HER. This work proposes a practical strategy for developing single metal atom doped MBene as a dual-function electrocatalyst.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d2cp02209e
In silico design of single transition metal atom anchored defective boron carbide monolayers as high-performance electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Development of low-cost and high-efficiency single atom catalysts (SACs) is essential for catalyzing nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR) under ambient conditions. Current SACs suffer from low selectivity and poor activity, making it hard for them to meet the requirements of industrial applications. Here, we present a graphene-like BC3 monolayer as a substrate for single metal atoms. The catalytic performance of 4d and 5d metal atoms anchored in a vacancy containing BC3 monolayer for NRR is systematically investigated by first-principles calculations. We find that Re@VB is outstanding among all candidates, exhibiting high catalytic activity and selectivity, with a low limiting potential of −0.28 V. A new descriptor involving the active site and its environment is proposed, which has a volcano relationship with several factors in the catalytic process, establishing a link between the intrinsic properties of the active site and the catalytic performance. This study opens a new route to designing efficient catalysts with BC3 as a substrate.",Nanoscale,10.1039/d2nr02796h
Boosting the oxygen reduction reaction behaviour of atomic Fe-N4 active sites in porous honeycomb-like carbon via P heteroatom doping,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Fe-N-C single atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) with porphyrin-like Fe-N4 species are one of the most promising alternatives to the platinum-group-metal-based electrocatalysts used for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, limited attention is paid on delicately optimizing the free energy barrier of Fe-N4 active sites through heteroatom doping in the carbon skeleton. Herein, Fe single atoms (SAs) on heteroatoms N- and P-codoped porous honeycomb-like carbon (Fe-N4/NP-PHC) have been rationally designed. The as-developed Fe-N4/NP-PHC catalyst with abundant accessible active sites showed an impressive onset potential (Eonset = 1.0 V) and half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.89 V) under low electrocatalyst loading capacity, which is more positive than those of Pt/C and most SAECs. Encouragingly, the experimental results and DFT calculations systematically demonstrated that the optimized adsorption energy of the Fe-N4 sites in the P-doped carbon matrix facilitated the release of OH* and thus boosted the ORR performance. The metal-air battery containing Fe-N4/NP-PHC exhibited high peak power density and long-term working feasibility with a low voltage gap at large current densities. This study demonstrates that P doping in carbon matrix is an effective strategy to promote catalytic properties and presents a novel avenue for developing high-performance electrocatalysts for various electrochemical reactions.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta04255j
Calculation screening of Janus WSSe monolayer modified with single platinum group metal atom as efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts is eagerly desirable for electrochemical energy applications. Herein, using the first-principles computations, the structural, electronic, magnetic, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic properties of single platinum group metal (PGM) atom modified Janus WSSe monolayer systems are comprehensively investigated. The results reveal that the single PGM atom can be stably supported on the W top position of S side and effectively regulate the structural and electronic characteristics of Janus WSSe monolayer. Pd- and Pt-WSSe are effectively screened from the PGM-WSSe systems with the outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity elucidated, especially the Pd-WSSe exhibits even smaller overpotentials (ηORR ≈ 0.39 and ηOER ≈ 0.49 V). The mechanisms of prominent bifunctional catalytic activity of Pd- and Pt-WSSe are summarized including their moderate binding strength with O2 molecule, superior electrical conductivity, high intrinsic electric field and the d orbital occupancy of Pd and Pt atoms. Thus, the effective strategy to reduce the dosage of PGMs in PGM single atom catalysts (SACs) and to boost the bifunctional catalytic performance of Janus WSSe monolayer could be achieved, which would be useful to promote the exploration of novel bifunctional electrocatalysts.",Applied Catalysis A: General,10.1016/j.apcata.2022.118777
Ni single atoms anchored on N-doped carbon nanosheets as bifunctional electrocatalysts for Urea-assisted rechargeable Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The sluggish kinetics of oxygen electrode reactions is a bottleneck for the development of rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, we report a bifunctional electrocatalyst synthesized by anchoring individually dispersed Ni single atoms on N-doped carbon nanosheets (Ni SAs-NC), which exhibits an outstanding overall performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Based on that, a conceptual urea-assisted rechargeable ZAB by coupling ORR with UOR of a low thermodynamic potential is demonstrated to have significantly decreased charging voltage and high urea elimination rate. The high bifunctional electrocatalytic activities of Ni SAs-NC endow the urea-assisted ZAB with a dramatically increased energy conversion efficiency of 71.8%, which is improved by 17.1% as compares with the conventional ZABs. The successful implementation of Ni SACs based urea-assisted rechargeable ZABs with an improved energy conversion efficiency may prompt ZAB technology towards practical applications.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121352
Single-atom Ir and Ru anchored on graphitic carbon nitride for efficient and stable electrocatalytic/photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Renewable energy-powered water electrolysis and photocatalytic water splitting are two promising approaches to green hydrogen production. Electrocatalysts and photocatalysts are essential components determining the performance of water electrolyzers and photocatalytic reactors, respectively. Currently, there is a pressing need to develop efficient and stable electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for large-scale deployment of these devices to reach carbon neutrality. Herein, we report the synthesis of single-atom Ir and Ru anchored on mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (Ir-g-CN and Ru-g-CN), which can be used as electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Remarkably, Ru-g-CN shows a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 12.9 and 5.1 s−1 at an overpotential (η) of 100 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, outperforming Ir-g-CN, commercial Pt/C benchmark and many other advanced HER catalysts reported recently. Moreover, Ru-g-CN can deliver an exceptionally high mass activity of 24.55 and 8.78 A mg−1 at η = 100 mV in acidic and alkaline solutions, meanwhile exhibiting a high apparent current density, which is favorable for practical applications. Additionally, both Ru-g-CN and Ir-g-CN show outstanding catalytic stability, continuously catalyzing the HER in acidic and alkaline conditions for 120 h with minimal degradation. Besides, when used for photocatalytic water splitting, Ru-g-CN can achieve a high hydrogen production rate of 489.7 mmol H2 gRu−1 h−1, and shows good photocatalytic stability. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that loading Ir and Ru single-atoms on g-CN alters the electronic structure, resulting in a reduced bandgap and improved electrical conductivity, facilitating electron transfer during the catalysis. Moreover, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption on Ru-g-CN and Ir-g-CN is also substantially lowered, enhancing HER performance.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121318
Tuning the atomic configuration of Co-N-C electrocatalyst enables highly-selective H2O2 production in acidic media,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for both energy conversion devices and green hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis. Whereas, it remains a challenge to efficiently tune the oxygen reduction selectivity toward the target applications. Herein, we designed two kinds of Co-N-C materials with encapsulated Co nanoparticles (CoNP-N-C) and with atomically dispersed cobalt atoms strongly embedded into nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CoSA-N-CNTs), and successfully realized the ORR pathway transformation from four-electron (4e−) to two-electron (2e−) for high-performance H2O2 production. This tunability is ascribed to the modification of the atomic configuration of the Co-N-C catalyst. Remarkably, when employing CoSA-N-CNTs material as a 2e− ORR catalyst, the assembled electrode exhibits a high H2O2 production rate of approximately 974 ± 25 mmol gcat−1 h−1, along with an ultra-fast organic matter degradation performance. This work provides an efficient strategy for tuning oxygen reduction selectivity via a simple structure tuning of the materials for specific applications.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121312
Multi-level Descriptor Construction for Screening Eligible Single-Atom-Embedded Ternary B3C2P3Monolayers as Nitrogen Fixation Catalysts,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Electrochemical dinitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) provides a green method for low-temperature ammonia (NH3) synthesis, but this process is still hampered by high overpotential and poor Faradaic efficiency. Based on density functional theory, the NRR catalytic performances of 29 transition metal atoms anchored on the ternary B3C2P3monolayer (M/B3C2P3SACs) were systematically evaluated to screen eligible electrocatalysts. Combining the intrinsic physical properties of the metal atom and its coordinated atoms, ψ is selected from multi-level descriptors. The structure-activity relation of the SACs is clearly revealed, and the V/B3C2P3SAC stands near the top of the volcano plot with a small negative limiting potential of -0.30 V and a high theoretical selectivity of 87.4%. Moreover, all hydrogenation steps of the NRR process on the V/B3C2P3SAC exhibit surmountable barriers under room temperature with a large rate constant of 3.42 × 10-2s-1, exhibiting a promising catalytic activity. Besides, the SAC structure remains well with no bond breaking under 500 K. The V atom doping can be beneficial to increasing the electrical conductivity of the SAC, and the 3d-orbitals of the V atom have a good degree of matching with the 2p-orbitals of N2, leading to the fact that the anti-bonding orbitals of N2are partially occupied by the d-electrons and facilitating N2activation. This study not only offers promising NRR catalyst candidates but also provides an efficient descriptor for quick prescreening among different candidates and activity modulation.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c02876
Single-Atom Electrocatalysis for Hydrogen Evolution Based on the Constant Charge and Constant Potential Models,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.DFT calculations are performed at constant charge, while practical electrochemical reactions often take place under constant potential. To unravel the effect of the model difference on single-atom electrocatalysis, we implement benchmarked DFT and grand-canonical DFT calculations to systematically investigate the hydrogen adsorption on 99 single-atom M-NxCymotifs. We find that the initial electrode potentials for all M-NxCyare negative, leading to the loss of system electrons once their electrode potentials are fixed at 0 V/SHE. We prove that the quantitive difference of ΔG(*H) between the CCM and CPM is proportional to the square difference of total charge change before and after H adsorption, which originates from the adjustment of electronic occupation states. Our work provides theoretical insight into the differential capacitance model in the graphene-confining SACs for the HER and emphasizes the importance of CPM for in silico design of electrocatalysts.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01288
Improving the Energetic Stability and Electrocatalytic Performance of Au/WSSe Single-Atom Catalyst with Tensile Strain,"© 2022 by the authors.In the areas of catalysis and renewable energy conversion, the development of active and stable electrocatalysts continues to be a highly desirable and crucial aim. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) provide isolated active sites, high selectivity, and ease of separation from reaction systems, becoming a rapidly evolving research field. Unfortunately, the real roles and key factors of the supports that govern the catalytic properties of SACs remain uncertain. Herein, by means of the density functional theory calculations, in the Au/WSSe SAC, built by filling the single Au atom at the S vacancy site in WSSe monolayer, we find that the powerful binding between the single Au atom and the support is induced by the Au d and W d orbital hybridization, which is caused by the electron transfer between them. The extra tensile strain could further stabilize the Au/WSSe by raising the transfer electron and enhancing the orbital hybridization. Moreover, by dint of regulating the antibonding strength between the single Au atom and H atom, the extra tensile strain is capable of changing the electric-catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of Au/WSSe as well. Remarkably, under the 1% tensile strain, the reaction barrier (0.06 eV) is only one third of that of free state. This theoretical work not only reveals the bonding between atomic sites and supports, but also opens an avenue to improve the electric-catalytic performance of SACs by adjusting the bonding with outer factors.",Nanomaterials,10.3390/nano12162793
Single-Atom Catalysts Supported on the Graphene/Graphdiyne Heterostructure for Effective CO2Electroreduction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Electrochemical reduction of CO2to high-energy chemicals is a promising strategy for achieving carbon-neutral energy circulation. However, designing high-performance electrocatalysts for the CO2reduction reaction (CO2RR) remains a great challenge. In this work, by means of density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the transition metal (TM) anchored on the nitrogen-doped graphene/graphdiyne heterostructure (TM-N4@GRA/GDY) as a single-atom catalyst for CO2electroreduction applications. The computational results show that Co-N4@GRA/GDY exhibits remarkable activity with a low limiting potential of -0.567 V for the reduction of CO2to CH4. When the charged Co-N4@GRA/GDY system is immersed in a continuum solvent, the reaction barrier decreases to 0.366 eV, which is ascribed to stronger electron transfer between GDY and transition metal atoms in the GRA/GDY heterostructure. In addition, the GRA/GDY heterostructure system significantly weakens the linear scaling relationship between the adsorption free energy of key CO2reduction intermediates, which leads to a catalytic activity that is higher than that of the single-GRA system and thus greatly accelerates the CO2RR. The electronic structure analysis reveals that the appropriate δ-πinteraction will affect the d orbital electron distribution, which is directly relevant to the selectivity and activity of catalysis. We hope these computational results not only provide a potential electrocatalyst candidate but also open up an avenue for improving the catalytic performance for efficient electrochemical CO2RR.",Inorganic Chemistry,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c02020
"Transition Metal (Co, Ni, Fe, Cu) Single-Atom Catalysts Anchored on 3D Nitrogen-Doped Porous Carbon Nanosheets as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts for Zn–Air Battery","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Exploring highly active and cost-efficient single-atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical for the large-scale application of Zn–air battery. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that the intrinsic ORR activity of the active metal of SACs follows the trend of Co > Fe > Ni ≈ Cu, in which Co SACs possess the best ORR activity due to its optimized spin density. Guided by DFT calculations, four kinds of transition metal single atoms embedded in 3D porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (MSAs@PNCN, M = Co, Ni, Fe, Cu) are synthesized via a facile NaCl-template assisted strategy. The resulting MSAs@PNCN displays ORR activity trend in lines with the theoretical predictions, and the Co SAs@PNCN exhibits the best ORR activity (E1/2 = 0.851 V), being comparable to that of Pt/C under alkaline conditions. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra verify the atomically dispersed Co-N4 sites are the catalytically active sites. The highly active CoN4 sites and the unique 3D porous structure contribute to the outstanding ORR performance of Co SAs@PNCN. Furthermore, the Co SAs@PNCN catalyst is employed as cathode in Zn–air battery, which can deliver a large power density of 220 mW cm–2 and maintain robust cycling stability over 530 cycles.",Small,10.1002/smll.202202476
Tuning the Selective Ethanol Oxidation on Tensile-Trained Pt(110) Surface by Ir Single Atoms,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethanol is critical for the commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells. However, the complete oxidation of ethanol suffers from poor efficiency due to the low C1 pathway selectivity. Herein, single-atomic Ir (Ir1) on hcp-PtPb/fcc-Pt core–shell hexagonal nanoplates (PtPb@PtIr1 HNPs) enclosed by Pt(110) surface with a 7.2% tensile strain is constructed to drive complete electro-oxidation of ethanol. Benefiting from the construction of Ir1 sites, the PtPb@PtIr1 HNPs exhibit a Faraday efficiency of 57.93% for the C1 pathway, which is ≈8.3 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C-JM. Furthermore, the PtPb@PtIr1 HNPs show a top-ranked electro-activity achieving 45.1-fold and 56.3-fold higher than the specific and mass activities of Pt/C-JM, respectively. Meanwhile, the durability can be significantly enhanced by the construction of Ir1 sites. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the strong synergy on the PtPb@PtIr1 HNPs surface significantly promotes the breaking of C C bond of CH2CO* and facilitates CO oxidation and suppresses the deactivation of the catalyst. This work offers a unique single-atom approach using low-coordination active sites on shape-controlled nanocrystals to tune the selectivity and activity toward complicated catalytic reactions.",Small,10.1002/smll.202202587
Atomic-Level Pt Electrocatalyst Synthesized via Iced Photochemical Method for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction with High Efficiency,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.In heterogeneous catalysis, metal particle morphology and size can influence markedly the activity. It is of great significance to rationally design and control the synthesis of Pt at the atomic level to demonstrate the structure-activity relationship toward electrocatalysis. Herein, a powerful strategy is reported to synthesize graphene-supported platinum-based electrocatalyst, that is, nanocatalysts with controllable size can be prepared by iced photochemical method, including single atoms (Pt-SA@HG), nanoclusters (Pt-Clu@HG), and nanocrystalline (Pt-Nc@HG). The Pt-SA@HG exhibits unexpected electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances with 13 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 current densities which surpass Pt-Clu@HG and Pt-Nc@HG. The in situ X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations determine the Pt-C3 active site is linchpin to the excellent HER performance of Pt-SA@HG. Compared with the traditional Pt-Nx coordination structure, the pure carbon coordinated Pt-C3 site is more favorable for HER. This work opens up a new way to adjust the metal particle size and catalytic performance of graphene at a multiscale level.",Small,10.1002/smll.202203422
CoN5 Sites Constructed by Anchoring Co Porphyrins on Vinylene-Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Developing effective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction (CO2RR) is of critical importance for producing carbon-neutral fuels. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an ideal platform for constructing catalysts toward CO2RR, because of their controllable skeletons and ordered pores. However, most of these COFs are synthesized from Co-porphyrins or phthalocyanines-based monomers, and the available building units and resulting catalytic centers in COFs are still limited. Herein, Co-N5 sites are first developed through anchoring Co porphyrins on an olefin-linked COF, where the Co active sites are uniformly distributed in the hexagonal networks. The strong electronic coupling between Co porphyrins and COF is disclosed by various characterizations such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory calculation (DFT). Thanks to the CoN5 sites, the catalytic COF shows remarkable catalytic activity with Faraday efficiencies (FECO) of 84.2–94.3% at applied potentials between −0.50 and −0.80 V (vs RHE), and achieves a turnover frequency of 4578 h–1 at −1.0 V. Moreover, the theoretical calculation further reveals that the CoN5 sites enable a decrease in the overpotential for the formation COOH*. This work provides a design strategy to employ COFs as scaffold for fabricating efficient CO2 electrocatalysts.",Small,10.1002/smll.202200736
Highly efficient electroreduction of CO2 by defect single-atomic Ni-N3 sites anchored on ordered micro-macroporous carbons,"© 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Microporous supports typically fail to fully expose active sites for electrolytes and CO2 molecules, and this usually results in low current density for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). To overcome the biggest obstacle and facilitate commercial applications, defective single-atomic Ni-N3 sites anchored to ordered micro-macroporous N-doped carbon (Ni-N/OMC) have been prepared by the pyrolysis of the Ni-ZIF-8@PS (ZIF = zeolitic imidazolate framework) and are intended to provide enhanced CO2RR with a current density at an industrial level. This Ni-ZIF-8@PS is constructed of nickel-based ZIF-8 embedded in the three-dimensional (3D) highly ordered polystyrene spheres (PS). The 3D ordered micro-macroporous architecture of Ni-N/OMC could facilitate the mass transfer of substrates to the accessible defective single-atomic Ni-N3 sites through micropores (0.6 nm) and macropores (∼200 nm) interconnected by 50 nm channels. In a flow cell, Ni-N/OMC exhibits almost 100.0% CO Faraday efficiency (FECO) between −0.2 and −1.1 V vs. RHE and an industrial level CO partial current density of 208 mA cm−2. It has a turnover frequency of 1.5×105 h−1 at −1.1 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which exceeds that of most reported nickel-based electrocatalysts. This excellent CO2RR performance for Ni-N/OMC makes it a state-of-the-art electrocatalyst for CO2RR. Theoretical calculations show that the defective Ni-N3 site can lower the energy of *COOH formation compared with that of the Ni-N4 site, thereby accelerating CO2RR. Ni-N/OMC can also be utilized as a cathodic catalyst in Zn-CO2 battery, exhibiting high CO selectivity in the discharge process and excellent stability. This work paves a pathway to rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts with 3D hierarchically ordered micro-macroporous architecture for CO2RR towards industrial production and commercial applications.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Science China Chemistry,10.1007/s11426-022-1263-5
Pyrrolic N-Stabilized Monovalent Ni Single-Atom Electrocatalyst for Efficient CO2 Reduction: Identifying the Role of Pyrrolic–N and Synergistic Electrocatalysis,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Engineering the electronic structure of metal, N-doped carbon catalysts is a potential strategy for increasing the activity and selectivity of CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). However, establishing a definitive link between structure and performance is extremely difficult due to constrained synthesis approaches that lack the ability to precisely control the specific local environment of M-N-C catalysts. Herein, a soft-template aided technique is developed for the first time to synthesize pyrrolic N4-Ni sites coupled with varying N-type defects to synergistically enhance the CO2RR performance. The optimal catalyst helps attain a CO Faradaic efficiency of 94% at a low potential of −0.6 V and CO partial current density of 59.6 mA cm−2 at −1 V. Results of controlled experimental investigations indicate that the synergy between Ni-N4 and metal free defect sites can effectively promote the CO2RR activity. Theoretical calculations revealed that the pyrrolic N coordinated Ni-N4 sites and C atoms next to pyrrolic N (pyrrolic N-C) have a lower energy barrier for the formation of COOH* intermediate and optimum CO* binding energy. The pyrrolic N regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst, resulting in lower CO2 adsorption energy and higher intrinsic catalytic activity.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202202351
Rational design of copper-based single-atom alloy catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Electrochemical CO2-reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising way to alleviate energy crisis and excessive carbon emission. The Cu-based electrocatalysts have been considered for CO2RR to generate hydrocarbons and alcohols. However, the application of Cu electrocatalysts has been restricted by a high onset potential for CO2RR and low selectivity. In this study, we have designed a series of Cu-based single-atom alloy catalysts (SAAs), denoted as TM1/Cu (111), by doping isolated 3d-transition metal (TM) atom onto the Cu (111) surface. We theoretically evaluated their stability and investigated the activity and selectivity toward CO2RR. Compared to the pure Cu catalyst, the majority TM1/Cu (111) catalysts are more favorable for hydrogenating CO2 and can efficiently avoid the hydrogen-evolution reaction due to the strong binding of carbonaceous intermediates. Based on the density functional theory calculations, instead of the HCOOH or CO products, the initial hydrogenation of CO2 on SAAs would form the *CO intermediate, which could be further hydrogenated to produce methane. In addition, we have identified the bond angle of adsorbed *CO2 can describe the CO2 activation ability of TM1/Cu (111) and the binding energy of *OH can describe the CO2RR activity of TM1/Cu (111). We speculated that the V/Cu (111) can show the best activity and selectivity for CO2RR among all the 3d-TM-doped TM1/Cu (111). This work could provide a rational guide to the design of new type of single-atom catalysts for efficient CO2RR. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research,10.1007/s12274-022-4476-2
High-density/efficient surface active sites on modified separators to boost Li-S batteries via atomic Co3+-Se termination,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Various and critical electrocatalytic processes are involved during the redox reactions in the Li-S batteries, which extremely depend on the surface structure and chemical state. Recently, single-atom concept unlocks a route to maximize the use of surface-active atoms, however, further increasing the density of active site is still strictly limited by the inherent structure that single-atoms are only highly-dispersed on substrate. Herein, we provide a viewpoint that an elaborate facet design with single-crystalline structure engineering can harvest high-density surface active sites, which can significantly boost the electrocatalyst performance for excellent Li-S batteries. Specifically, the single-crystal CoSe2 (scCS) exhibits three-types of terminated (011) facet, efficiently obtaining the surface with a high-rich Co3+—Se bond termination, in contrast with lots of surface grain boundaries and dangling bonds in polycrystalline CoSe2. Surprisingly, the surface active sites concentration can reach more than 69%. As anticipated, it can provide high-density and high-efficient active sites, enormously suppressing the shuttle effect and improving the reaction kinetics via accelerating the conversion and deposition of polysulfides and Li2S. This surface lattice strategy with element terminated mode is a promising approach for designing electrocatalyst effect-based energy system, not merely for Li-S batteries.

Design of platinum single-atom doped metal nanoclusters as efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalysts by coupling electronic descriptor,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Inspired by the single-atom catalysts (SACs) concept, we rationally design a series of Pt single atom catalysts embedded in different transition metal nanoclusters through first-principles calculations. In these so-called “crown-jewel” (CJ) structures, Pt atoms (jewels) occupy the vertex sites of the metal nanocluster (crown) surface. We investigated the thermal stability and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity of these catalysts. The results reveal that CJ-structured PtCu nanoclusters are stable and possess a comparable or even better ORR activity compared to Pt catalyst, making it a promising candidate for low-cost ORR catalysts. The effect of cluster size on the adsorption strength of ORR intermediates and catalytic property has also been studied. Furthermore, the overall ORR catalytic activity trend of these SACs is explained based on analysis of their electronic properties. A descriptor Ψ was established to provide further insight into the correlation between the electronic structure and catalytic activity, which provides a design strategy for new ORR catalysts. More importantly, we reveal that this electronic descriptor can be extended to predict other CJ-structured nanoclusters. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research,10.1007/s12274-022-4343-1
Spin-related bimetallic-hybridization induced by asymmetric super-nearest exchange interaction in single-atom dimer for hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) plays a critical role in designing energy conversion devices, but is facing the challenges of low-cost electrocatalysts and insufficient understanding about spin-related reaction kinetics. Different from traditional nanostructures, this work focuses on the spin-related orbital hybridization and charger transfer by bimetallic super-nearest exchange interaction to improve the catalytic activity of single-atom dimer (SAD). Herein, systematic first-principle screening discloses that the spin-related electronic reconfiguration at the SAD atomic interface can optimize the occupied sates at 3d-orbtial and shift the d-band center, thereby, benefiting for proton adsorption and dissociation. As a result, the Gibbs free energy and carrier transfer can be effectively optimized.

Atomic Fe−N Doped Multi-Cavity Hollow Carbon Nanoreactor as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium-sulfur (Li−S) batteries have been highly praised for the key rechargeable batteries due to their numerous advantages. However, the sluggish conversion and shuttling effect of polysulfides restrict their practicality. Here we rationally design the multi-cavity hollow carbon spheres doped with atomic Fe−N sites (Fe−N/MCHCS) as physically/chemically double-confined catalytic nanoreactors for the efficient sulfur host materials. The Fe−N/MCHCS with hierarchical porous structure and high pore volume ensures the high loading mass, and the multi-cavity structures significantly buffer the volume expansion of sulfur and enhance the electronic contact. Meanwhile, atomic Fe offers chemical binding site and efficiently catalyzes the conversion of polysulfides during cycling, thus immobilizing and alleviating the shutting effect of polysulfides. Consequently, the Fe−N/MCHCS nanoreactor based Li−S batteries deliver a long cycling life of 1135 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 C and high-rate capability of 1055 mAh g−1 at 8 C. Even under practical conditions with a high sulfur mass loading of 5.0 mg cm−2, a steady areal capacity of 4.85 mAh cm−2 is attained. This strategy combing multi-cavity hollow carbon with single atom catalysis opens a reliable route to design highly stable and high-performance Li−S batteries.",Batteries and Supercaps,10.1002/batt.202200154
Atomically-dispersed Mn-(N-C2)2(O-C2)2 sites on carbon for efficient oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Owing to their ultimate mass-catalytic activity, simple active site configuration and readily tunable electronic structures, transition-metal single atoms (SAs) on carbon support have emerged as a new category of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we exemplify the use of atomically dispersed Mn with N, O heteroatoms-coordinated Mn sites to enhance alkaline ORR performance. A combined sol-gel/carbonization approach is developed to controllably anchor Mn-SAs onto graphitic carbon nanosheets via a hybridized N, O coordination configuration of Mn-(N-C2)2(O-C2)2 (denoted as Mn-SA@CNSs). The obtained Mn-SA@CNSs exhibits superior alkaline ORR electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.88 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH. The rechargeable Zn–air battery assembled using Mn-SA@CNSs air cathode can readily attain a high power density of 177 mW cm−2 with a narrow voltage gap of 0.76 V at 5 mA cm−2. Density functional theory calculations unveil that altering the coordination environment of Mn-SAs from N-coordinated Mn-(N-C2)4 to N-/O-coordinated Mn-(N-C2)2(O-C2)2 alters the d-band electronic structures and regulates the binding strength of ORR intermediates on Mn-SA sites to dramatically reduce the energy barrier and enhance ORR activity. The exemplified hybridization coordination approach in this work would be applicable to alter the electronic structures of other transition-metal SAs for ORR and other reactions.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.04.016
Tailoring 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction selectivity on h-BN-based single-atom catalysts from superoxide dismutase: A DFT investigation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays an important role in human lives. Currently applying the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e- ORR) to synthesis of H2O2 is regarded as a promising strategy to substitute the traditional anthraquinone method;however, design of efficient 2e- ORR catalysts remains difficulties. Inspired by superoxide dismutase, which can covert superoxide (•O2–) to H2O2. We design eight types of 2e- ORR catalysts in which Ni is embedded on defective boron nitride (h-BN) which coordinates with non-metal atoms (B, N, O, S) doping to imitate the active center of superoxide dismutase. Density functional theory (DFT) computations demonstrate that NiN2S2/BN has the most favorable 2e- ORR catalytic performance with the overpotential of 0.11 V. Especially, the competitive 4e- ORR pathway can be significantly suppressed, as indicated by favorable thermodynamics with more positive Gibbs free energies of O* above 3.52 eV. Besides, coordination environments change induced different adsorption behavior of O2, electron density around Ni, and work function are unveiled. Our work is expected to provide useful understanding for development of novel high-efficiency h-BN-based single-atom catalysts for 2e- ORR.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153233
Theoretical investigation of HER/OER/ORR catalytic activity of single atom-decorated graphyne by DFT and comparative DOS analyses,"© 2022Multifunctional catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) play a key role in the development of electrochemical energy systems. Moreover, single metal atoms embedded in a two-dimensional material substrate have emerged as outstanding catalysts. Owing to its large surface area and novel electronic properties, graphyne (GY) is a promising substrate for the fabrication of single-atom catalysts (SACs). By doping foreign atoms of different types on GY, their local electronic/chemical environment and catalytic performance would be improved. Based on recent experimental advances, we used density functional theory (DFT) simulations to identify a suitable series of co-decorated GY materials, with boron-, nitrogen-, phosphorus-, and sulfur-doped GY (3B-GY, 3N-GY, 3P-GY, 3S-GY) as the two-dimensional substrate, and transition metal (TM) atoms (Sc to Zn) as the single-atom centers. Our screening process showed that Co@GY and Ni@3B-GY would be highly promising multifunctional electrocatalysts for HER/OER/ORR. Then, we built quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) between electronic density of states (DOS) structure and catalytic performance using comparative DOS analysis (CoDOSA). The present results further support the development and application of d-band center theory. Our work identifies promising co-decorated GY for HER/OER/ORR and provides quantitative information on their DOS.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153237
The structure–activity correlation of single-site Ni catalysts dispersed onto porous carbon spheres toward electrochemical CO2 reduction,"© 2022 The Author(s)Single-site metal catalysts (SSMCs) with high activity and stability have been widely applied as electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) process. However, it remains challenging for precise controlling the nanoarchitectures and atomic metal sites of SSMCs to investigate their corresponding structural and related catalytic properties toward CO2RR. In this work, four categories of Ni based SSMCs with different nanoarchitectures were successfully synthesized, including Ni-N doped solid carbon spheres with micropore (Ni-N/C-S-Micro), Ni-N doped hollow carbon spheres with micropore (Ni-N/C–H-Micro), Ni-N doped hollow carbon spheres with mesopore (Ni-N/C–H-Meso), and Ni-N doped hollow carbon spheres with micropore and mesopore (Ni-N/C–H-Micro/Meso). Ni-N/C-S-Micro and Ni-N/C–H-Micro were favorable for the generation of atomic Ni sites in SSMCs, resulting in higher loading amount of Ni, while Ni-N/C–H-Meso with open structure leads to the aggregation of Ni species during pyrolysis. In comparison with Ni-N/C-S-Micro, carbon spheres with hollow and mesoporous structures can enhance the diffusion of CO2 and improve the catalytic activity of per Ni site toward CO2RR process. Thus, Ni-N/C–H-Meso shows the highest turnover frequencies (TOF) value for CO2RR to CO. This study provides a SSMCs design protocol for investigation the SSMCs correlation of structure and properties toward electrochemical conversions.",Fuel,10.1016/j.fuel.2022.124043
Tuning single metal atoms anchored on graphdiyne for highly efficient and selective nitrate electroreduction to ammonia under aqueous environments: A computational study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3−) to ammonia (NH3) has attracted considerable interest due to its great promises for eliminating harmful pollutants and simultaneously producing valuable NH3, in which the development of highly efficient and selective catalysts still remains huge challenges. Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we explored the potential of a series of single transition metal atoms anchored on graphdiyne (TM/GDY) as the electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to NH3. By systematically evaluating the activity and selectivity of various TM/GDY candidates, Os/GDY was identified as an ideal NO3RR catalyst with a low limiting potential (−0.37 V) and great suppressing effect on the competing reactions. Moreover, the volcano plot was established based on the scaling relation of free adsorption energies of various intermediates, and the origin of the catalytic activity NO3RR was well rationalized by the descriptor of the adsorption strength and the polarized charge on the adsorbed NO3 * species. Our results not only proposed an eligible electrocatalyst to boost NO3RR for ammonia synthesis, but also deeply understand the mechanism of NO3RR process.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153213

Single-atomic iron-nitrogen 2D MOF-originated hierarchically porous carbon catalysts for enhanced oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022The requirement of sustainable energy is of great significance for easing the energy shortage crisis, in which the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in metal-air batteries and fuel cells plays a crucial role in efficient energy conversion. The development of noble-metal-free, efficient, and stable ORR electrocatalysts is highly desirable but remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report an atomically dispersed Fe and N co-doped hierarchically porous carbon (Fe-SA/HPC) catalyst derived from two-dimensional leaf-like ZIF-L with preeminent ORR activity. The Fe-SA/HPC catalyst, benefitting from hierarchically porous structure and rich highly-dispersed active sites of FeNx, put up ORR performance with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The current density with a 0.382 mg cm−2 loading of catalyst in a rotating disk electrode (RDE) test can reach 24.65 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V, which is nearly twice that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the co-regulation of defects and graphitic nitrogen can optimize the local electronic redistribution for active sites and endow them with a lower free-energy barrier towards the ORR. This work provides certain inspiration for the development of highly reactive atomic metal catalysts through rational topology structure engineering and nitrogen moiety regulation.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135849
Theoretical considerations on activity of the electrochemical CO2 reduction on metal single-atom catalysts with asymmetrical active sites,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical CO2 reduction to higher-value hydrocarbons beyond C1 products has attracted much attention recently. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are regarded as promising CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. However, most SACs only show activity to C1 products. In this work, we considered the activity and the synergetic effect of dual active sites for metal SACs supported on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed. First, by using the adsorption energies of CO* on the metal site and that of H* on the nitrogen site as bi-descriptors, we predicted seven out of 14 metal centers have the propensity to generate beyond CO products. To further evaluate the catalyst activity on beyond CO product formation, we established reaction pathways towards ethylene through M/N or M/C. Ru has the best performance (the limiting potential is −0.90 V) by taking M/N as active sites. A dual volcano-shaped plot is built up based on the CO adsorption energies on metal sites, which can be used to indicate whether M/C or M/N shows better performance for a specific metal center. Our work shed light on developing criteria to guide the design of CO2 reduction electrocatalysts with dual active sites.",Catalysis Today,10.1016/j.cattod.2021.06.013
High-Throughput computational screening of Single-atom embedded in defective BN nanotube for electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) have been widely used in various energy applications such as hydrogen storage, gas sensor, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and so on. Herein, the potential application of BNNT-based catalysts was explored in electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) by density functional theory (DFT) computations. A series of single metal/non-metal atoms (18 transition metals (3d ∼ 5d) and 6 non-metals (B, C, N, Si, P, and As)) supported on the defective BNNT were investigated. Among them, Os-doped (Os@BNNT) single-atom catalyst (SAC) can significantly promote the NRR process, and possess a rather low overpotential (0.31 V), as well as high selectivity over HER competition. The confined Os atom not only serves as an electron donor to supply electrons for NRR, but also acts as a channel for interfacial charge transfer between substrate and NRR intermediates. Moreover, the curved surface of BNNT can decrease the barrier for protonating *NH2 to·NH3. The synergistic collaboration of single-atom Os catalyst and curved surface of BNNT facilitates the NRR process. Our findings open up a new avenue for designing novel nanotube-based materials as eNRR electrocatalysts.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153130

However, it is challenging to explore an electrocatalyst that simultaneously possesses ORR and OER active sites. Herein, we designed a strategy for one-step adsorption to manufacture a nitrogen-doped carbon-supported Co and Ru single-atom catalyst (Co/Ru SAs-N-C) with outstanding ORR and OER performance under alkaline conditions. The catalyst displays a half-wave potential of 0.855 V in ORR and a low potential of 338 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 current density in OER, thus obtaining ΔE = 0.713 V. The result of the density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates that the introduction of Ru sites enhances catalytic performance for ORR and OER.",Catalysis Science and Technology,10.1039/d2cy00930g

An efficient synthesis strategy is urgently needed to alleviate these disadvantages. In this work, a two-dimensional (2D) single-atom Fe-N-C catalyst derived from a layered complex was designed and synthesized for the ORR. Fe single atoms dispersed on 2D hierarchical porous N-doped carbon nanosheets (Fe-N-C) were derived from a layered complex through the coordination of Fe3+and benzidine hydrochloride. The unique 2D hierarchical porous nanosheets with a special edge effect can not only provide a large specific surface area and promote the mass transfer of ORR but also facilitate the affinity of Fe single atoms.

Designing multifunctional electrocatalysts with improved activity and abundant active sites to regulate the dynamics for sulfur electrochemistry is still a significant challenge. Herein, we proposed a thiourea assisted pyrolysis combined with hard template method to synthesize cobalt single atoms co-coordinated by N and S atoms embedded hollow carbon spheres (Co-NS-HCS) as a novel sulfur host. The Co-NS-HCS mainly consists of well-dispersed Co-N3S-C center sites where Co is co-bonded by N and S atoms. Systematical characterizations revealed that the Co-NS-HCS exhibit improved SRR electrocatalytic properties with higher exchange current density and larger electron transfer number than that of Co-N-HCS. When equipped in sulfur cathodes, the S@Co-NS-HCS exhibits superior rate performance (925 mAh g−1 at 2 C), long cycle stability (69.1% of capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C). Moreover, the assembled Li-S pouch type cell also exhibits competitive cyclic performance that work stably for 100 cycles at 0.1 C with a high capacity retention of 84.7%.

Fe Single-atom Sites in Two-Dimensional Nitrogen-doped Porous Carbon for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The development of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is important for energy conversion devices, such as fuel cells, and metal-air batteries. Here, we have developed a confined space strategy to prepare a two-dimensional (2D) leaf-like nitrogen (N)-containing porous carbon as a single-atom catalyst substrate. ZIF−L materials have been confined in a thin silica layer to regulate the pyrolysis. The obtained Fe single atoms doped N-containing porous carbons (Fe SAs/N−C) maintain the 2D morphology and have Fe single-atom active sites. Correspondingly, Fe SAs/N−C exhibits excellent ORR performance (E1/2 of 0.907 V), which is more positive than those of commercially available Pt/C (0.874 V) and most reported non-noble metal catalysts. The durability test shows that Fe SAs/N−C exhibits good stability during electrocatalytic process.

Engineering Water Molecules Activation Center on Multisite Electrocatalysts for Enhanced CO2Methanation,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The renewable energy-powered electrolytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) using water as a reaction medium is one of the most promising paths to store intermittent renewable energy and address global energy and sustainability problems. However, the role of water in the electrolyte is often overlooked. In particular, the slow water dissociation kinetics limits the proton-feeding rate, which severely damages the selectivity and activity of the methanation process involving multiple electrons and protons transfer. Here, we present a novel tandem catalyst comprising Ir single-atom (Ir1)-doped hybrid Cu3N/Cu2O multisite that operates efficiently in converting CO2to CH4. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the Ir1facilitates water dissociation into proton and feeds to the hybrid Cu3N/Cu2O sites for the *CO protonation pathway toward *CHO. The catalyst displays a high Faradaic efficiency of 75% for CH4with a current density of 320 mA cm-2in the flow cell.

Tracking the Oxygen Dynamics of Solid-Liquid Electrochemical Interfaces by Correlative In Situ Synchrotron Spectroscopies,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.ConspectusOxygen-involved electrocatalytic processes, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), are central to a series of advanced modern energy and conversion technologies, such as water electrolyzers, fuel cells, and CO2reduction or N2fixation devices. A comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the charge transfer and energy conversion process that ubiquitously occurs over solid-liquid electrochemical interfaces during oxygen electrocatalysis is crucial for understanding the key essence of oxygen-related electrochemistry. The huge challenges for dynamic studies over solid-liquid interfaces during oxygen electrocatalysis lie in the all-embracing electrochemical processes of the catalytic reactions, associated with both structural and reactive intermediates evolution on the electrode surface, and in the significant influence of the aqueous environments of electrolytes used. Hence, overcoming these challenges intrinsically calls for a great cooperation of multiple cutting-edge in situ technologies. Synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray absorption fine structure (SR-XAFS) spectroscopy is highly sensitive to the local atomic structure of nanomaterials, and SR-based Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) spectroscopy features unique molecular fingerprint identification to determine active species on the surface of electrodes. One can imagine that the correlative in situ SR-XAFS/FTIR spectroscopic investigations will potentially provide sufficient, reliable, and complementary information at the atomic/molecular level to depict vivid and comprehensive ""dynamic movies"" of solid-liquid electrochemical interfaces during oxygen electrocatalysis, which will help effectively promote/simplify the complicated screening process of advanced oxygen electrocatalysts for efficient high-energy-density energy systems.In this Account, starting with some fundamentals of SR-based spectroscopic technologies, tips for obtaining high-quality SR-XAFS and SR-FTIR spectroscopy results during the electrocatalytic process are comprehensively specified. Subsequently, the latest research achievements of dynamic investigations mainly from our group based on in situ SR-XAFS and/or SR-FTIR spectroscopies will be systematically scrutinized and properly emphasized in detail, where the currently attractive metal-organic-framework (MOF) nanomaterials and single-atom catalysts (SACs) are selected as the main object of research. Moreover, the vital contributions of correlative in situ SR-XAFS/FTIR studies on new discoveries of the dynamic evolution of solid-liquid interfaces during oxygen electrocatalysis are highlighted. In particular, our pioneering research found that the potential-dependent dynamically coupled oxygen formed in the precatalytic stage was a very useful promoter in SACs to promote efficient OER kinetics under acidic conditions. In addition, the in situ generated metastable Ni1-N2centers with more structural degrees of freedom in SACs could potentially facilitate the fast 4e-ORR kinetics.

The effect of reduction temperature on the dispersion state and electronic structure of Ru species has been fully studied using electronic and spectroscopic characterizations. The sample reduced at 300 °C has excellent HER activity with overpotentials of 10.8 and 53.8 mV to deliver 10 mA/cm2in alkaline and acidic media, respectively, which is among the best activities in the reported results.

A doping-adsorption-pyrolysis strategy for constructing atomically dispersed cobalt sites anchored on a N-doped carbon framework as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Renewable energy technology development focuses on the exploration of economical and efficient non-precious metal catalysts to replace precious metal catalysts in electrocatalytic reactions including oxygen reduction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution (HER). Herein, we synthesized a cobalt single atom catalyst anchored on a N-doped carbon framework by a doping-adsorption-pyrolysis strategy. The optimized Co SAs/CN-3 catalyst showed excellent HER and ORR bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, which could be attributed to the highly dispersed Co-N4 active sites, large specific surface area and abundant pore structure. Density functional theory shows that the isolated active Co-N4 site shows low hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy, and promotes the adsorption of H and oxygen-containing intermediates in HER and ORR. This work not only provides a new idea for the construction of transition metal catalysts with atomic accuracy but also provides powerful guidance for the development of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.",RSC Advances,10.1039/d2ra03351h
In Situ Clustering of Single-Atom Copper Precatalysts in a Metal-Organic Framework for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate-To-Ammonia Reduction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.When serving as a ""precatalyst"", metal-organic frameworks (MOF) usually incur uncontrollable framework collapse in electrocatalysis. Herein, we report an anticollapse MOF-supported single-Atom Cu precatalyst for electrocatalytic nitrate-To-Ammonia reduction reaction (NARR), which can be applied in the rechargeable ammonia energy storage (RAES) technology. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed the association of the formation of real catalytic sites with the in situ clustering of single-Atom Cu during NARR. Notably, the noncollapse MOF can afford the confined space to prevent the excessive aggregation of Cu atoms, leading to uniform ultrasmall nanoclusters (ca. 4 nm). Moreover, it achieves a maximal Faradaic efficiency toward NH3of 85.5%, a formation rate of NH3of 66 μmol h-1cm-2, and a specific activity of 53.43 mgNH3h-1mgCu-1in 5 mM NO3-solution. The specific activity is found to be at least 3.3 times higher than that of other reported Cu-based catalysts. Density function theory (DFT) calculation further confirms the size effect and the host-guest interaction in facilitating the NO3-activation and the reaction energy decrease. Besides, it also exhibits a high selectivity of ammonia-To-nitrate of 93.3%, displaying great potential in RAES technology.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.2c02033
Copper single-atom catalyst as a high-performance electrocatalyst for nitrate-ammonium conversion,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), as a promising alternative to the Haber-Bosh process, provides new opportunities for ammonia (NH3) production from the environmental and energy viewpoint. However, the NH3 yield rate and selectivity for NO3RR are still limited due to the lack of efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we demonstrate an active and selective copper single-atom catalyst (Cu-N-C) for nitrate reduction to NH3. The complete conversion of nitrate (50 mg L−1 NO-3-N) was achieved at −1.5 V vs. SCE with a high NH3 yield rate (9.23 mg h−1 mg−1cat.) and selectivity (94%). Remarkably, Cu-N-C dramatically inhibited the formation of toxic nitrite and double-nitrogen products due to the enhanced nitrite adsorption and restrained N-N coupling that led to nitrate deep reduction to NH3. The remaining nitrate (0.06 mg L−1) and nitrite (1 mg L−1) fully meet the drinking-water standards. Density functional theory simulations reveal that the single-site nature of Cu-N-C facilitated the reduction of HNO*3 to NO*2 and NH*2 to NH3, thus leading to the selective nitrate reduction to NH3.",Journal of Hazardous Materials,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128892
Revealing the oxygen Reduction/Evolution reaction activity origin of Carbon-Nitride-Related Single-Atom catalysts: Quantum chemistry in artificial intelligence,"© 2022The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are two critical reactions for renewable energy applications, such as water electrolysers and fuel cells. During the last decade, single-atom catalysts (SACs) deposited on carbon nitrides have been a rising star as superior electrocatalysts for ORR and OER. However, either experiments or theoretical simulations cannot screen all the possible SACs at a high speed and low cost. Herein, with the aid of density functional theory (DFT), machine learning (ML) and cross validation scheme, the best performing ML models (root mean square error = 0.24 V/0.23 V for ORR/OER) are established and implemented to describe the underlying pattern of easily obtainable physical and chemical properties and the ORR/OER overpotentials of carbon-nitride-related SACs. The best SACs recommended by the ML models are further verified by DFT calculations to confirm the reliability and accuracy of models. Three promising oxygen electrocatalysts with higher activity than noble metals are identified including RhPc, Co-N-C, and Rh-C4N3. The electron number of d orbital of the metal active site is determined as the most effective descriptor by further model analysis. Finally, the universal mathematical expressions which can accurately predict the catalytic activity of carbon-nitride-related SACs without DFT calculations and ML process are obtained. The revolutionary DFT-ML hybrid scheme opens a new avenue of rational and low-cost design principles of desirable catalysts and even the exploration of recondite activity origin in an interdisciplinary view.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135946
Atomically dispersed Pt-O coordination boosts highly active and durable acidic hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Noble metals atomically anchored on supporters has given rise to a series of excellent heterogeneous catalysts. Nevertheless, the stability of single-atom catalysts (SACs) is of great challenge for large-scale practical applications due to their highly unsaturated coordination environment. In this work, a doping confinement strategy was employed to tightly immobilize single atoms from agglomeration and detachment through a strong metal-supporter interaction (MSI) of Pt-O coordination. Combining with theoretical calculation, the highly oxidized platinum in MoO3 not only optimizes its electronic properties with good conductivity but also offers more active sites towards hydrogen production. Thus, the doped system presents a considerable HER performance with an overpotential of 26 ± 1 mV at 10 mA/cm2 as well as excellent catalytical stability of at least 125 h in acidic media. It also displays an outstanding mass activity of 500 A/gPt at an overpotential of 23 mV, which far outstrips that of commercial Pt/C. This work may pave a novel and facile strategy to stabilize SAC for the development of high-performance HER electrocatalysts in the future.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135957
Single-atom palladium anchored N-doped carbon towards oxygen electrocatalysis for rechargeable Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Herein, an atomically dispersed palladium catalyst on a hierarchical porous structure of N-doped carbon (Pd1/N-C) is prepared using a facile freeze-drying-assisted strategy. Freeze-drying methods not only suppress the aggregation of Pd atoms but also successfully produce abundant nanopores. HAADF-STEM confirms that Pd single atoms are uniformly anchored on the N-C surface. The Pd1/N-C electrocatalyst enhances the ORR and OER activity and durability compared to N-C and Pd-NPs/N-C. Rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs) based on novel Pd1/N-C exhibit a peak power density of 113.7 mW cm−2 and maintain a voltage efficiency of 64.0% after 495 cycles at a discharge current density of 5 mA cm−2.

PdFe Single-Atom Alloy Metallene for N2 Electroreduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom alloys hold great promise for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), while the comprehensive experimental/theoretical investigations of SAAs for the NRR are still missing. Herein, PdFe1 single-atom alloy metallene, in which the Fe single atoms are confined on a Pd metallene support, is first developed as an effective and robust NRR electrocatalyst, delivering exceptional NRR performance with an NH3 yield of 111.9 μg h−1 mg−1, a Faradaic efficiency of 37.8 % at −0.2 V (RHE), as well as a long-term stability for 100 h electrolysis. In-depth mechanistic investigations by theoretical computations and operando X-ray absorption/Raman spectroscopy indentify Pd-coordinated Fe single atoms as active centers to enable efficient N2 activation via N2-to-Fe σ-donation, reduced protonation energy barriers, suppressed hydrogen evolution and excellent thermodynamic stability, thus accounting for the high activity, selectivity and stability of PdFe1 for the NRR.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202205923
Synergies of Atomically Dispersed Mn/Fe Single Atoms and Fe Nanoparticles on N-Doped Carbon toward High-Activity Eletrocatalysis for Oxygen Reduction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.PGM-free (platinum group metal) electrocatalysts are intensively investigated and used as low-cost catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the field of fuel cells, but further studying their performance improvement methods and actual reaction mechanism is still a big a challenge. In this work, a novel eletrocatalyst containing atomically dispersed Mn/Fe single atoms (SAs) and Fe nanoparticles (NPs) on N-doped carbonaceous (nanosheet/nanotube hybrids) is fabricated via a simple pyrolysis method. This high-activity ORR electrocatalyst has higher half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.91 V) and superior long-term durability in alkaline solutions and outperforms Pt/C catalysts, which can be ascribed to the synergetic interaction between Mn/Fe SAs and Fe-NPs. FeNPs/MnFeSAs-NC-25 has stronger reactant adsorption ability and a lower dissociation energy barrier than FeNPs/FeSAs-NC, which is conducive to breaking the O-O bond and accelerating ORR kinetics. This work presents a method to synthesize carbon-based electrocatalysts with high ORR activity and stability and shows that a variety of active sites encapsulated in N-doped carbonaceous materials can be a class of competitive candidates for PGM-free electrocatalysts.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c08572
Synergistically Enhanced Single-Atom Nickel Catalysis for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The feature endowing atomic Ni-N-C electrocatalysts with exceptional intrinsic alkaline hydrogen evolution activity is hitherto not well-documented and remains elusive. To this end, we rationally exploited the hierarchical porous carbon microstructures as scaffolds to construct unique Ni-N2+2-S active sites to boost the sluggish Volmer reaction kinetics. Density functional theory reveals an obvious d-band center (ϵd) upshift of the edge-hosted Ni-N2+2-S sites compared with pristine Ni-N4, which translates to a more stabilized OH adsorption. Moreover, the synergetic dual-site (Ni and S atom) interplay gives rise to a decoupled regulation of the adsorption strength of intermediate species (OHad, Had) and thereby energetic water dissociation kinetics. Bearing these in mind, sodium thiosulfate was deliberately adopted as an additive in the molten salt system for controllable synthesis, considering the simultaneous catalyst morphology and active-site modulation. The target Ni-N2+2-S catalyst delivers a low working overpotential (83 mV@10 mA cm-2) and Tafel slope (100.5 mV dec-1) comparable to those of representative transition metal-based electrodes in alkaline media. The present study provides insights into the metal active-site geometry and promising synergistic effects over single-atom catalysis.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c05817
Screening of transition metal single-atom catalysts doped on γ-graphyne-like BN sheet for efficient nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Ammonia is an important industrial raw material. To promote the production of ammonia, it is urgent to develop efficient catalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR). Here, we have reported a novel electrocatalyst: γ-graphyne-like BN sheet-supported single metal atom (M/γBN, M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Ru) for NRR and studied the effect of Hubbard U correction in single-atom catalysts. The results of adsorption show that Ti/γBN, V/γBN, and Ru/γBN have the best adsorption energy for nitrogen. A detailed analysis of the NRR mechanism indicates that V/γBN has the lowest energy barrier in the rate-determining step when it follows a distal mechanism. Further analysis shows that the superior catalytic performance in V/γBN sheet is mainly attributed to the electron donation and back-donation mechanism. More interestingly, V/γBN greatly inhibited HER selectivity. By analyzing the doping structure and adsorption system, it can be found that when considering Hubbard U correction, there will be an obvious correlation between energy and distance. This study not only provides a basis for understanding the mechanism of nitrogen reduction reaction catalyzed by single-atom catalysts but also provides a new design idea for the rational design of high-efficiency NRR catalysts.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164675
Lattice-Confined Single-Atom Fe1Sx on Mesoporous TiO2 for Boosting Ambient Electrocatalytic N2 Reduction Reaction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Mimicking natural nitrogenase to create highly efficient single-atom catalysts (SACs) for ambient N2 fixation is highly desired, but still challenging. Herein, S-coordinated Fe SACs on mesoporous TiO2 have been constructed by a lattice-confined strategy. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra demonstrate that Fe atoms are anchored in TiO2 lattice via the FeS2O2 coordination configuration. Theoretical calculations reveal that FeS2O2 sites are the active centers for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Moreover, the finite element analysis shows that confinement of opened and ordered mesopores can facilitate the mass transport and offer an enlarged active surface area for NRR. As a result, this catalyst delivers a favorable NH3 yield rate of 18.3 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 with a high Faradaic efficiency of 17.3 % at −0.20 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode. Most importantly, this lattice-confined strategy is universal and can also be applied to Ni1Sx@TiO2, Co1Sx@TiO2, Mo1Sx@TiO2, and Cu1Sx@TiO2 SACs. Our study provides new hints for the design and biomimetic synthesis of highly efficient NRR electrocatalysts.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202203022
"Molecularly Engineered Carbon Platform to Anchor Edge-Hosted Single-Atomic M-N/C (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) Electrocatalysts of Outstanding Durability","© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.A powerful synthetic protocol based on a molecularly engineered anchoring carbon platform (ACP) is reported to stabilize concentrated edge-hosted single-atom catalytic sites of M-N (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) on carbon supports. Polymerization with l-cysteine as an additional organic precursor produces an ACP sheath around the carbon nanotube (CNT)-graphene (GR) hybrid support made of a small domain size with abundant edge sites and doped with sulfur. A few-minute-long microwave pyrolysis anchors strongly the single-atomic M-N moiety on the ACP while suppressing its agglomeration during the high-temperature synthesis and makes the ACP highly graphitized. As a typical example, the edge-hosted single-atomic catalytic sites in Fe-N/S-CNT-GR provide superior pH-independent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity to previously reported Fe-N-C catalysts and commercial Pt/C while demonstrating oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in basic conditions similar to known state-of-the-art catalysts. In particular, the Fe-N/S-CNT-GR catalyst is much more stable than commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts during ORR and OER in both base and acid solutions. Inferior stability is a common problem of this type of single-atom heterogeneous catalyst (SAC). An aqueous Zn-air battery with our Fe-N/S-CNT-GR catalyst operates as effectively as the device with the commercial Pt/C-Ir/C catalysts. We believe that our protocol based on the molecularly engineered ACP and microwave pyrolysis can provide a new concept to synthesize a new generation of durable SACs, which could have broad applications in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.2c00697
Reconstructing the Linear Relations by Designing Bi-Atom Sites on NbS2for the Efficient Nitrogen Reduction Reaction,"© 2022 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS""). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.Tremendous enthusiasm for bi-atom catalysts (BACs) for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has been aroused due to the insufficient activation of N2 in single-atom catalysts (SACs). Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the catalytic activities toward NRR of the NbS2-based SACs and BACs have been investigated. Our results reveal that there are typical volcano relationships between catalytic activities (limiting potentials) and the adsorption free energies of NNH∗ (ΔG(NNH)∗) on SACs, but the peak limiting potential is only-0.57 V. Interestingly, this volcano relationship can be reconstructed by supporting bi-atoms sites on NbS2, in which ΔG(NH2)∗ can serve as the descriptor to predict the catalytic performance of BACs. Most importantly, the optimal limiting potential of Mn2 BAC can reach a significant-0.26 V via an enzymatic pathway. These results compare catalytic activities between SACs and BACs and provide a theoretical basis for exploring novel, highly efficient electrocatalysts for NRR.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1149/1945-7111/ac7c95
A Single-Atom Fe-N-C Catalyst with Ultrahigh Utilization of Active Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Fe-N-C single-atom catalysts (SACs) are emerging as a promising class of electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to replace Pt-based catalysts. However, due to the limited loading of Fe for SACs and the inaccessibility of internal active sites, only a small portion of the sites near the external surface are able to contribute to the ORR activity. Here, this work reports a metal–organic framework-derived Fe-N-C SAC with a hierarchically porous and concave nanoarchitecture prepared through a facile but effective strategy, which exhibits superior electrocatalytic ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.926 V (vs RHE) in alkaline media and 0.8 V (vs RHE) in acidic media while maintaining excellent stability. The superior ORR activity of the as-designed catalyst stems from the unique architecture, where the hierarchically porous architecture contains micropores as Fe SAC anchoring sites, meso-/macro-pores as accessible channels, and concave shell for increasing external surface area. The unique architecture has dramatically enhanced the utilization of previously blocked internal active sites, as confirmed by a high turnover frequency of 3.37 s−1 and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis with a distinct shift of adsorption edge.",Small,10.1002/smll.202203326
"Construction of N, P Co-Doped Carbon Frames Anchored with Fe Single Atoms and Fe2P Nanoparticles as a Robust Coupling Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.A coupling catalyst of highly dispersed N, P co-doped carbon frames (NPCFs) anchored with Fe single atoms (SAs) and Fe2P nanoparticles (NPs) is synthesized by a novel in situ doping–adsorption–phosphatization strategy for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The optimized Fe SAs-Fe2P NPs/NPCFs-2.5 catalyst shows a superior ORR activity and stability in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 0.1 m KOH, respectively. Theoretical calculations reveal a synergistic effect, in that the existence of Fe2P weakens the adsorption of ORR intermediates on active sites and lowers the reaction free energy. The doped P atoms with a strong electron-donating ability elevate the energy level of Fe-3d orbitals and facilitate the adsorption of O2. The active Fe atoms exist in a low oxidation state and are less positively charged, and they serve as an electron reservoir capable of donating and releasing electrons, thus improving the ORR activity. Operando and in situ characterization results indicate that the atomically dispersed Fe-N4/Fe-P coupled active centers in the Fe SAs-Fe2P NPs/NPCFs-2.5 catalyst are characteristic of the different catalytic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline media. This work proposes a novel idea for constructing coupling catalysts with atomic-level precision and provides a strong reference for the development of high-efficiency ORR electrocatalysts for practical application.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202203621
Mesopore-Rich Fe–N–C Catalyst with FeN4–O–NC Single-Atom Sites Delivers Remarkable Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance in Alkaline Media,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Fe–N–C catalysts offer excellent performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. With a view toward boosting the intrinsic ORR activity of Fe single-atom sites in Fe–N–C catalysts, fine-tuning the local coordination of the Fe sites to optimize the binding energies of ORR intermediates is imperative. Herein, a porous FeN4–O–NCR electrocatalyst rich in catalytically accessible FeN4–O sites (wherein the Fe single atoms are coordinated to four in-plane nitrogen atoms and one subsurface axial oxygen atom) supported on N-doped carbon nanorods (NCR) is reported. Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) verifies the presence of FeN4–O active sites in FeN4–O–NCR, while density functional theory calculations reveal that the FeN4–O coordination offers a lower energy and more selective 4-electron/4-proton ORR pathway compared to traditional FeN4 sites. Electrochemical tests validate the outstanding intrinsic activity of FeN4–O–NCR for alkaline ORR, outperforming Pt/C and almost all other M–N–C catalysts reported to date. A primary zinc–air battery constructed using FeN4–O–NCR delivers a peak power density of 214.2 mW cm−2 at a current density of 334.1 mA cm−2, highlighting the benefits of optimizing the local coordination of iron single atoms.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202202544
Triggering Lattice Oxygen Activation of Single-Atomic Mo Sites Anchored on Ni–Fe Oxyhydroxides Nanoarrays for Electrochemical Water Oxidation,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Tuning the reactivity of lattice oxygen is of significance for lowering the energy barriers and accelerating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, single-atomic Mo sites are anchored on Ni–Fe oxyhydroxide nanoarrays by a facile metal–organic-framework-derived strategy, exhibiting superior performance toward the OER in alkaline media. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and isotope-labeling experiments reveal the involvement of lattice oxygen during OER cycles. Combining theoretical and experimental investigations of the electronic configuration, it is comprehensively confirmed that the incorporation of single-atomic Mo sites enables higher oxidation state of the metal and strengthened metal–oxygen hybridization, as well as the formation of oxidized ligand holes above the Fermi level. In a word, the considerable acceleration of water oxidation is achieved via enhancing the reactivity of lattice oxygen and triggering the lattice oxygen activation. This work may provide new insights for designing ideal electrocatalysts via tuning the chemical state and activating the anions ligands.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202202523
Local Spin-State Tuning of Iron Single-Atom Electrocatalyst by S-Coordinated Doping for Kinetics-Boosted Ammonia Synthesis,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (e-NRR) is envisaged as alternative technique to the Haber–Bosch process for NH3 synthesis. However, how to develop highly active e-NRR catalysts faces daunting challenges. Herein, a viable strategy to manipulate local spin state of isolated iron sites through S-coordinated doping (FeSA-NSC) is reported. Incorporation of S in the coordination of FeSA-NSC can induce the transition of spin-polarization configuration with the formation of a medium-spin-state of Fe (t2g6 eg1), which is beneficial for facilitating eg electrons to penetrate the antibonding π-orbital of nitrogen. As a consequence, a record-high current density up to 10 mA cm−2 can be achieved, together with a high NH3 selectivity of ≈10% in a flow cell reactor. Both experimental and theoretical analyses indicate that the monovalent Fe(I) atomic center in the FeSA-NSC after the S doping accelerates the N2 activation and protonation in the rate-determining step of *N2 to *NNH.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202202240
Interatomic Electronegativity Offset Dictates Selectivity When Catalyzing the CO2 Reduction Reaction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Achieving efficient efficiency and selectivity for the electroreduction of CO2 to value-added feedstocks has been challenging, due to the thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecules and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, a dual-single-atom catalyst consisting of atomically dispersed CuN4 and NiN4 bimetal sites is synthesized with electrospun carbon nanofibers (CuNi-DSA/CNFs). Theoretical and experimental studies reveal the strong electron interactions induced by the electronegativity offset between the Cu and Ni atoms. The delicately averaged and compensated electronic structures result in an offset effect that optimizes the adsorption strength of the *COOH intermediate and boosts the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) kinetics, notably promoting the intrinsic activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The CuNi-DSA/CNFs catalyst exhibits an outstanding FECO of 99.6% across a broad potential window of −0.78– −1.18 V (vs the reversible hydrogen electrode), a high turnover frequency of 2870 h–1, and excellent durability (25 h). Furthermore, an aqueous Zn-CO2 battery for CO2 power conversion is constructed. This atomic-level electronegativity offset of the dual-atom structures provides an appealing direction to develop advanced electrocatalysts for the CO2RR.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202200579
Neuron-inspired design of hierarchically porous carbon networks embedded with single-iron sites for efficient oxygen reduction,"© 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The rational structure design and active-site regulation of catalysts is crucial for high energy output. Herein, B, F co-doped Fe−N−C embedded in a flexible and free-standing hierarchical porous carbon framework (Fe-SA-FPCS) was reported. Owing to the synergism of optimized intrinsic activity, fast mass transfer and well exposed active sites, the Fe-SA-FPCS exhibits a high half-wave potential (E1/2=0.89 V vs. RHE) and small Tafel slope (66 mV dec−1). Theoretical calculations uncover that B, F co-doping could accelerate the desorption of OH* on Fe sites, which can effectively increase oxygen reduction reaction activity. As the cathode for Zn-air batteries (ZABs), Fe-SA-FPCS demonstrates a high open-circuit voltage (1.51 V), large peak power density (168.4 mW cm−2) and excellent stability. The assembled flexible solid-state ZAB exhibits excellent stability during charge and discharge cycling in the flat/bent state, and is promising for the application of portable and flexible devices. This work provides a new perspective for the fabrication of single-atom electrocatalysts with well-designed structure and excellent electrochemical energy conversion and storage capability.",Science China Chemistry,10.1007/s11426-022-1285-y
Charge transfer and orbital reconstruction of non-noble transition metal single-atoms anchored on Ti2CTx-MXenes for highly selective CO2 electrochemical reduction,"© 2022 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of SciencesInspired by MXene nanosheets and their regulation of surface functional groups, a series of Ti2C-based single-atom electrocatalysts (TM@Ti2CTx, TM = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) with two different functional groups (T = –O and –S) was designed. The CO2RR catalytic performance was studied using well-defined ab initio calculations. Our results show that the CO2 molecule can be more readily activated on TM @Ti2CO2 than the TM@Ti2CS2 surface. Bader charge analysis reveals that the Ti2CO2 substrate is involved in the adsorption reaction, and enough electrons are injected into the 2π*u orbital of CO2, leading to a V-shaped CO2 molecular configuration and partial negative charge distribution. The V-shaped CO2 further reduces the difficulty of the first hydrogenation reaction step. The calculated ΔG of the first hydrogenation reaction on TM@Ti2CO2 was significantly lower than that of the TM@Ti2CS2 counterpart. However, the subsequent CO2 reduction pathways show that the UL of the potential determining step on TM@Ti2CS2 is smaller than that of TM@Ti2CO2. Combining the advantages of both TM@Ti2CS2 and TM@Ti2CO2, we designed a mixed functional group surface with –O and –S to anchor TM atoms. The results show that Cr atoms anchored on the surface of mixed functional groups exhibit high catalytic activity for the selective production of CH4. This study opens an exciting new avenue for the rational design of highly selective MXene-based single-atom CO2RR electrocatalysts.",Chinese Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/S1872-2067(21)64018-4
Theoretical study of transition metal doped α-borophene nanosheet as promising electrocatalyst for electrochemical reduction of N2,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Ammonia synthesis is an essential industrial production process. Through first principle calculations, this work investigated 3d/4d transition metal (TM) embedded α-borophene monolayer (BM-α) as efficient electrocatalyst for N2 reduction reaction (NRR). The computational results show that V, Cr, and Mo@BM-α exhibit excellent catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis via the enzymatic pathway. Analyses reveal that the unoccupied d orbitals of TM (V, C, and Mo) accept lone pair electrons from N2 while the anti-bonding orbitals of N2 accept a large amount of negative charge from TM, which lead to the elongation of the N[tbnd]N triple bond, thus effectively activating the nitrogen. In addition, V@BM-α and Mo@BM-α show a strong suppressive effect on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and overcome the possible oxidation on the catalyst surface. Our results demonstrate the α-borophene is a superior substrate for single atom catalysts which can be designed as high performance NRR electrocatalysts.",Computational and Theoretical Chemistry,10.1016/j.comptc.2022.113732

Herein, a binary-atom catalyst (PtCo-NC) consisting of atomically dispersed Pt and Co on nitrogen doped carbon is rationally designed and synthesized by a mechano-thermal milling method. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of atomically dispersed Co results in spin polarization of adjacent Pt atoms, which optimizes the absorption energy and lowers the energy barrier of the rate-determining step, thus accelerating oxygen catalyzed reaction kinetics for PtCo-NC. As a consequence, the constructed PtCo-NC possesses an outstanding ORR performance with a positive half-wave potential (0.85 V), large kinetic current density (83.3 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V), low Tafel slope (85 mV dec−1) and robust cyclic stability (more than 90% retention after 170 h in alkaline media). As the cathodic catalyst, the zinc-air battery driven by PtCo-NC delivers the maximum power density (204 mW cm−2), excellent rate capacity and remarkable durability. The present work may provide new insight into boosting oxygen reduction reaction activity, leading the exploration toward highly efficient catalysts for renewable energy storage and conversion systems.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107341
Rational design of highly efficient electrocatalytic single-atom catalysts for nitrogen reduction on nitrogen-doped graphene and g-C2N supports,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is a very attractive route for ammonia production under ambient conditions. It is a challenging issue to develop efficient electrocatalysts in NRR process. Herein, we designed a series of NRR single-atom catalysts (SACs), namely, transition metal single-atom anchored on nitrogen-doped porous graphene with six-fold N6 cavity (TM@N6-G). Based on spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the stability and catalytic performance of TM@N6-G SACs were systemically investigated. Six promising catalysts (Nb, Mo, Tc, Ta, W, and Re@N6-G) are selected from 14 candidates by screening the free energy changes of the first and last electric chemical steps. Detailed NRR mechanism studies show that the six SACs have superior electrochemical NRR performance, especially W@N6-G, reaching low limiting potentials of −0.23 V. Furthermore, we extend the present study to another kind of graphitic carbon nitrides, g-C2N, which has a similar N6 cavity. Our calculations show that five TM@g-C2N SACs have good stability and high activity and selectivity for NRR. In addition, ΔG*NNH, dN-N, and ICOHP can be used as descriptors to understand the origin of NRR catalytic activity of these two kinds of catalysts. The present work may provide valuable clues for exploring promising and efficient NRR electrochemical catalysts.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231449
"Single Cu atom dispersed on S,N-codoped nanocarbon derived from shrimp shells for highly-efficient oxygen reduction reaction","© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Recently, Cu-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered increasing attention as substitutes for platinum-based catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Therefore, a facile, economical, and efficient synthetic methodology for the preparation of a high-performance Cu-based SAC electrocatalyst for the ORR is extremely desired, but is also significantly challenging. In this study, we propose a ball-milling method to synthesize isolated metal SACs embedded in S,N-codoped nanocarbon (M-NSDC, M = Cu, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Pt, and Pd). In particular, the Cu-NSDC SACs exhibit high electrochemical activity for the ORR with half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.84 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), 20 mV higher than Pt/C) in alkaline electrolyte, excellent stability, and electrocatalytic selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the desorption of OH* intermediates was the rate-determining step over Cu-NSDC. This study creates a pathway for high-performance ORR single atomic electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications and provides opportunities to convert biowaste materials into commercial opportunities.

Activating the Basal Planes in 2H-MoTe2 Monolayers by Incorporating Single-Atom Dispersed N or P for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Overall Water Splitting,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Designing stable, low-cost yet highly active electrocatalysts is crucial for overall water splitting, representing a promising approach for clean energy generation. In this work, periodic density functional theory calculations are applied to investigate, for the first time, the possibility of activating the inert basal surfaces of 2H-MoTe2 monolayers by N- or P-doping for overall electrocatalytic water splitting. The results show that both N- and P-doping significantly change the surface charge distribution and electronic band structure of 2H-MoTe2. In addition, the doping-induced structural disorder generates more active sites, leading to improved electrochemical activities for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Especially, N-doped 2H-MoTe2 (4 × 4 × 1) exhibits a better OER catalytic performance with a small overpotential of 1.82 eV (vs normal hydrogen electrode), while both N- and P-doped MoTe2 monolayers exhibit outstanding HER catalytic performance with a Gibbs free energy of the hydrogen adsorption ((Formula presented.) for N-doped MoTe2 and (Formula presented.) for P-doped MoTe2) smaller than that of pristine 2H-MoTe2 ((Formula presented.)).

Atomic manganese coordinated to nitrogen and sulfur for oxygen evolution,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Lack of high-efficiency, cost-efficient, and well-stocked oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is a main challenge in large-scale implementation of electrolytic water. By regulating the electronic structure of isolated single-atom metal sites, high-performance transition-metal-based catalysts can be fabricated to greatly improve the OER performance. Herein, we demonstrate single-atom manganese coordinated to nitrogen and sulfur species in two-dimensional graphene nanosheets Mn-NSG (NSG means N- and S- codoped graphene) as an active and durable OER catalyst with a low overpotential of 296 mV in alkaline media, compared to that of the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. Theoretical calculations and experimental measurements reveal that the Mn-N3S sites in the graphene matrix are the most active sites for the OER due to modified electronic structure of the Mn site by three nitrogen and one sulfur atoms coordination, which show lower theoretical overpotential than the Mn-N4 sites and over which the O-O formation step is the rate-determining step.

Ligand centered electrocatalytic efficient CO2 reduction reaction at low overpotential on single-atom Ni regulated molecular catalyst,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) into value-added chemicals/fuels is crucial for realizing the sustainable carbon cycle while mitigating the energy crisis. However, it is impeded by the relatively high overpotential and low energy efficiency due to the lack of efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we develop an isolated single-atom Ni catalyst regulated strategy to activate and stabilize the iron phthalocyanine molecule (Ni SA@FePc) toward a highly efficient CO2RR process at low overpotential. The well-defined and homogenous catalytic centers with unique structures confer Ni SA@FePc with a significantly enhanced CO2RR performance compared to single-atom Ni catalyst and FePc molecule and afford the atomic understanding on active sites and catalytic mechanism. As expected, Ni SA@FePc exhibits a high selectivity of more significant Faraday efficiency (≥ 95%) over a wide potential range, a high current density of ∼ 252 mA·cm2 at low overpotential (390 mV), and excellent long-term stability for CO2RR to CO. X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurement and theoretical calculation indicate the formation of NiN4-O2-FePc heterogeneous structure for Ni SA@FePc. And CO2RR prefers to occur at the raised N centers of NiN4-O2-FePc heterogeneous structure for Ni SA@FePc, which enables facilitated adsorption of *COOH and desorption of CO, and thus accelerated overall reaction kinetics.

Achieving high-efficient urea oxidation via regulating the rate-determining step over a V single atom incorporated Co hydroxide electrocatalyst,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has emerged as a competitive approach for many energy-related technologies due to the low overpotential and fast reaction dynamics. The main challenge lies in fabricating high-efficient catalysts with optimized electronic structure and understanding the intrinsic structure-related mechanisms. Here, we report a feasible strategy of regulating the rate-determining step (RDS) of UOR via an electrochemical reconstructed Co hydroxide catalyst incorporated with V single atoms. The optimal catalysts exhibit an enhanced UOR performance after V incorporation while remarkably suppressed the competitive oxygen evolution with the potential of 1.54 V (vs RHE) to achieve the current density of 30 mA cm−2. Operando synchrotron-radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SR-FTIR) combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that enabled by single atom V incorporation, the RDS of UOR has been changed from the first deprotonation step to the second one with a lower energy barrier of 2.05 eV (vs 2.6 eV), which is thermodynamically favorable for the overall reaction process.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135768
Metal-Organic Frameworks Derived Electrocatalysts for Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction,"© 2022 The Chemical Society of Japan & Wiley-VCH GmbH.The increasing demands of energy and environmental concerns have motivated researchers to cultivate renewable energy resources for replacing conventional fossil fuels. The modern energy conversion and storage devices required high efficient and stable electrocatalysts to fulfil the market demands. In previous years, we are witness for considerable developments of scientific attention in Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) and their derived nanomaterials in electrocatalysis. In current review article, we have discussed the progress of optimistic strategies and approaches for the manufacturing of MOF-derived functional materials and their presentation as electrocatalysts for significant energy related reactions. MOFs functioning as a self-sacrificing template bid different benefits for the preparation of metal nanostructures, metal oxides and carbon-abundant materials promoting through the porous structure, organic functionalities, abundance of metal sites and large surface area. Thorough study for the recent advancement in the MOF-derived materials, metal-coordinated N-doped carbons with single-atom active sites are emerging candidates for future commercial applications.

The Pt/A-NiCo LDH electrocatalyst exhibits the highest catalytic ability with a low overpotential of 16 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a mass activity about 24.8-fold that of commercial Pt/C. The results suggest that the Pt single atom catalyst can not only accelerate the Volmer steps in alkaline media, but also optimize the hydrogen adsorption process, improving the HER catalytic activity.",Chemical Communications,10.1039/d2cc02732a
Tailoring the microenvironment in Fe–N–C electrocatalysts for optimal oxygen reduction reaction performance,"© 2022 Science China PressFe–N–C electrocatalysts, comprising FeN4 single atom sites immobilized on N-doped carbon supports, offer excellent activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), especially in alkaline solution. Herein, we report a simple synthetic strategy for improving the accessibility of FeN4 sites during ORR and simultaneously fine-tuning the microenvironment of FeN4 sites, thus enhancing the ORR activity. Our approach involved a simple one-step pyrolysis of a Fe-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework in the presence of NaCl, yielding a hierarchically porous Fe–N–C electrocatalyst containing tailored FeN4 sites with slightly elongated Fe–N bond distances and reduced Fe charge. The porous carbon structure improved mass transport during ORR, whilst the microenvironment optimized FeN4 sites benefitted the adsorption/desorption of ORR intermediates. Accordingly, the developed electrocatalyst, possessing a high FeN4 site density (9.9 × 1019 sites g−1) and turnover frequency (2.26 s−1), delivered remarkable ORR performance with a low overpotential (a half-wave potential of 0.90 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH.",Science Bulletin,10.1016/j.scib.2022.04.022
High performance transition metal-based electrocatalysts for green hydrogen production,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Hydrogen energy is a promising energy source that is environmentally friendly due to its long-term, large-capacity storage and low greenhouse gas emissions. However, the mass production of hydrogen is still technically difficult due to limitations in efficiency, stability, and cost, even though it can satisfy all of the current energy demands. Water splitting using an electrocatalyst is an efficient method for environmentally friendly hydrogen production, and various catalyst-related studies are being conducted for this purpose. For the last decade, transition metal-based compositions have been at the center of water splitting catalyst research. Despite numerous studies and developments, studies on transition metal-based catalysts so far still have various problems to be solved. Although excellent review papers on transition metal-based catalysts have been reported, the overall scope of transition metal-based catalysts has rarely been covered in the reports. In this review, we present the research about overall transition metal-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen production from four different categories, namely, alloys, transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), and single-atom catalysts (SACs). The fundamental roles of metal alloying and unique electrical properties of TMDs, LDHs, and SACs are mainly discussed. Furthermore, we present the recent advances in photovoltaic-electrochemical (PV-EC) systems for sustainable hydrogen production. Finally, perspectives on the issues to be addressed in the research on transition metal-based electrocatalysts are provided.",Chemical Communications,10.1039/d2cc02423c
Changing charge transfer mode with cobalt-molybdenum bimetallic atomic pairs for enhanced nitrogen fixation,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The single-atom catalyst is currently regarded as a promising electrocatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of N2 to NH3 but its development is impeded by the sluggish kinetics of the proton-coupled electron transfer on the unitary single-atom site. To address this issue, we developed a novel type of electrocatalyst with atomically dispersed Co-Mo pairs anchored on N-doped carbon frameworks (Co-Mo-SA/NC). Remarkably, the theoretical calculations reveal that the formation of Co-Mo asymmetric bimetallic active sites not only changes the “acceptance-donation” charge transfer mode on a single active site to “donation-donation” mode but also modifies the d-band center of the corresponding single atom, leading to enhanced polarization of the N = N triple bond and inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction. As a result, the Co-Mo-SA/NC catalyst achieves a high ammonia yield rate of 37.73 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and a desirable faradaic efficiency of 23.18% at −0.1 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, which are twofold higher than those of the isolated single-atom Co (Co-SA/NC) or Mo (Mo-SA/NC) catalyst. This study provides a promising new strategic design of an electrocatalyst using atomically dispersed metal-pairs to enhance electrochemical nitrogen fixation.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta02455a
Activation of Main-Group Antimony Atomic Sites for Oxygen Reduction Catalysis,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The catalytic activity of main-group metal is hard to promote because of the intrinsic lack of host d orbitals available to be combined. Herein, under the guidance of theoretical predictions, we find atom-dispersed antimony sites (Sb−N4 moieties) can be activated to achieve high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity using a functional group regulation strategy. Correspondingly, we manage to synthesize a main-group Sb single-atom catalysts (SACs) that comprises Sb−N4 active moieties functionalized by epoxy groups in the second microenvironment and incorporated in N-doped graphene (Sb1/NG(O)). The electron-rich epoxy group can adjust the electronic structure of Sb−N4 active moieties, thereby optimizing the adsorption of the intermediate. The Sb SACs are comparable to industrial Pt/C under alkaline conditions. This discovery provides new opportunities to manipulate and improve the catalytic activity of main-group-element electrocatalysts.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202202200
Electronic Regulation of Nickel Single Atoms by Confined Nickel Nanoparticles for Energy-Efficient CO2 Electroreduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Modulating the electronic structure of atomically dispersed active sites is promising to boost catalytic activity but is challenging to achieve. Here we show a cooperative Ni single-atom-on-nanoparticle catalyst (NiSA/NP) prepared via direct solid-state pyrolysis, where Ni nanoparticles donate electrons to Ni(i)−N−C sites via a network of carbon nanotubes, achieving a high CO current density of 346 mA cm−2 at −0.5 V vs RHE in an alkaline flow cell. When coupled with a NiFe-based anode in a zero-gap membrane electrolyzer, the catalyst delivers an industrially relevant CO current density of 310 mA cm−2 at a low cell voltage of −2.3 V, corresponding to an overall energy efficiency of 57 %. The superior CO2 electroreduction performance is attributed to the enhanced adsorption of key intermediate COOH* on the electron-rich Ni single atoms, as well as a high density of active sites.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202203335
Single boron modulated graphdiyne nanosheets for efficient electrochemical nitrogen fixation: a first-principles study,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The electroreduction of dinitrogen (N2) is a promising alternative approach for ammonia synthesis under mild conditions. In this work, metal-free electrocatalysts using a single boron atom doped into a graphdiyne (GDY) monolayer are fabricated for N2 fixation and conversion to NH3. The NRR electrochemical mechanism has been examined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our calculations revealed that configuration B(S3)@GDY fabricated using a single boron substituting the diacetylene carbon atom exhibits superior catalytic activity in the nitrogen reduction reaction. The preferred distal pathway of the NRR has an extremely low limiting potential of only 0.27 V. In addition, boron atom doping in GDY results in a small band gap (0.24 eV for B(S3)@GDY) and redistribution of the electron density. The electron deficient boron atom is largely positively charged, and thus plays a crucial role in the activation of the N = N bond. Moreover, the competing HER is effectively suppressed. This work provides an efficient metal-free single atom electrocatalyst for the NRR based on a 2D graphdiyne monolayer.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d2cp01711c

All rights reserved.The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is expected to achieve sustainable ammonia synthesis via direct nitrogen fixation; however, the high-quality catalysts that play a crucial role in the NRR are still lacking. The emerging transition metal-1,3,5-triethynylbenzene (TM-TEB) frameworks offer attractive possibilities in the electrochemical catalysis due to the featured atomic and electronic structures. This work presents a comprehensive first-principles study of the TM-TEB systems for TMs from the first three d-block series and systematically explores their potential applications as NRR electrocatalysts. By designing a hierarchical screening strategy, the TM-TEB systems are evaluated based on the NRR catalytic activity as well as the competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, in order to have a deeper understanding of the catalytic activities of the TM-TEB systems, diverse possible NRR paths on the TM-TEB surfaces are completely analyzed as well. Our analysis reveals that the TM-TEB systems with TM = V, Mo, Tc, W, and Os are electrocatalysts with a high NRR catalytic activity, while among them, only Mo- and V-TEB show promising NRR selectively. This work demonstrates the great potential of the TM-TEB systems as electrocatalysts in the NRR process, which improves the understanding of the TM-TEB systems and can motivate further exploration of their application in catalysis.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c05087
Platinum-Ruthenium Single Atom Alloy as a Bifunctional Electrocatalyst toward Methanol and Hydrogen Oxidation Reactions,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The precise regulation for the structural properties of nanomaterials at the atomic scale is an effective strategy to develop high-performance catalysts. Herein, a facile dual-regulation approach was developed to successfully synthesize Ru1Ptnsingle atom alloy (SAA) with atomic Ru dispersed in Pt nanocrystals. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure demonstrated that Ru atoms were dispersed in Pt nanocrystals as single atoms. Impressively, the Ru1Ptn-SAA exhibited an ultrahigh specific activity (23.59 mA cm-2) and mass activity (2.805 mA/μg-PtRu) for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and exhibited excellent exchange current density activity (1.992 mA cm-2) and mass activity (4.71 mA/μg-PtRu) for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Density functional theory calculations revealed that the introduction of Ru atoms greatly reduced the reaction free energy for the decomposition of water molecules, which promoted the removal of CO∗ in the MOR process and adjusted the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen and hydroxyl adsorption to promote the HOR. Our work provided an effective idea for the development of high performance electrocatalysts.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c02905
Synthetic Strategies to Enhance the Electrocatalytic Properties of Branched Metal Nanoparticles,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.ConspectusBranched metal nanoparticles have unique catalytic properties because of their high surface area with multiple branches arranged in an open 3D structure that can interact with reacting species and tailorable branch surfaces that can maximize the exposure of desired catalytically active crystal facets. These exceptional properties have led to the exploration of the roles of branch structural features ranging from the number and dimensions of branches at the larger scales to the atomic-scale arrangement of atoms on precise crystal facets. The fundamental significance of how larger-scale branch structural features and atomic-scale surface faceting influence and control the catalytic properties has been at the forefront of the design of branched nanoparticles for catalysis. Current synthetic advances have enabled the formation of branched nanoparticles with an unprecedented degree of control over structural features down to the atomic scale, which have unlocked opportunities to make improved nanoparticle catalysts. These catalysts have high surface areas with controlled size and surface facets for achieving exceedingly high activity and stability. The synthetic advancement has recently led to the use of branched nanoparticles as ideal substrates that can be decorated with a second active metal in the form of islands and single atoms. These decorated branched nanoparticles have new and highly effective catalytic active sites where both branch metal and decorating metal play essential roles during catalysis.In the opening half of this Account, we critically assess the important structural features of branched nanoparticles that control catalytic properties. We first discuss the role of branch dimensions and the number of branches that can improve the surface area but can also trap gas bubbles. We then investigate the atomic-scale structural features of exposed surface facets, which are critical for enhancing catalytic activity and stability. Well-defined branched nanoparticles have led to a fundamental understanding of how the branch structural features influence the catalytic activity and stability, which we highlight for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and biomass oxidation. In discussing recent breakthroughs for branched nanoparticles, we explore the opportunities created by decorated branched nanoparticles and the unique bifunctional active sites that are exposed on the branched nanoparticle surfaces. This class of catalysts is of rapidly growing importance for reactions including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), where two exposed metals are required for efficient catalysis. In the second half of this Account, we explore recent advances in the synthesis of branched nanoparticles and highlight the cubic-core hexagonal-branch growth mechanism that has achieved excellent control of all of the important structural features, including branch dimensions, number of branches, and surface facets. We discuss the slow precursor reduction as an effective strategy for decorating metal islands with controlled loadings on the branched nanoparticle surfaces and the spread of these metal islands to form single-atom active sites. We envisage that the key synthetic and structural advances identified in this Account will guide the development of the next-generation electrocatalysts.",Accounts of Chemical Research,10.1021/acs.accounts.2c00140
Synergistic effect of a diatomic boron-doped layered two-dimensional MSi2N4 monolayer for an efficient electrochemical nitrogen reduction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Developing efficient metal-free single-atom-catalysts (SACs) for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is of great significance, yet it remains a great challenge. By using first-principles calculations, we designed single B- and diatomic B-doped MSi2N4 monolayers (namely B@MSi2N4 and B2@MSi2N4, respectively, M = Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, and W) as electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction. Our calculation results show that the substitutional B doping significantly reduces the band gap of the material, and thus promotes the charge transfer required for the eNRR. The filled sp3 orbitals of the doped B atoms can back-donate electrons to the π* orbitals of N2 to form B-to-N π antibonding, weakening the N = N bond. Compared with the single B atom site, the synergistic effect of adjacent B atoms largely promotes the activation of N2. The detailed reaction free energy pathways show that one-B atom-doped MSi2N4 materials exhibit poor catalytic activity for N2 reduction to NH3. In contrary, the two adjacent B atom-doped MSi2N4 can effectively catalyze N2 conversion into NH3 while suppressing the HER, with a low limiting potential smaller than −0.3 V. In particular, for M = Ti, V, Nb, and Ta, all electrochemical elementary steps occurring on diatomic B sites for the eNRR are spontaneous through the distal mechanism. Furthermore, the eNRR process on B2@MoSi2N4 is easily achieved, kinetically, by overcoming the low activation barrier less than 0.77 eV. This work provides a new strategy for the design of metal-free single atom-based catalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta03667c
Harnessing Optimized Surface Reconstruction of Single-Atom Ni-Doped Ni-NiO/NC Precatalysts toward Robust H2O2Production,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Decentralized H2O2production from a 2e-oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway is appealing, wherein the rational design of electrocatalysts is the cornerstone rendering favorable catalytic activity/selectivity. Nevertheless, the real active moiety is elusive and the catalyst evolution during the reaction remains unexplored to date. Herein, we decipher in situ evolved surface chemistry of a Ni-based precatalyst (Ni SAC/Ni-NiO/NC-500) during the 2e-ORR process that results in a reconstructed catalyst (Ni SAC/Ni-NiO/NC-500-R). The phase transformation of the electrocatalyst is monitored by operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ X-ray analysis. With the optimized catalyst in hand, a 2e-ORR potential of 0.78 V (at 1.0 mA cm-2) and a high selectivity of 95% in an alkaline electrolyte are harvested. More encouragingly, high-flux H2O2is produced via photomediated electrosynthesis, enabling on-site degradation of organic pollutants with an impressive degradation rate approaching 100%.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c05622
Ni-based electrocatalysts for unconventional CO2 reduction reaction to formic acid,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdElectrochemical reduction stands as an alternative to revalorize CO2. Among the different alternatives, Ni single atoms supported on carbonaceous materials are an appealing catalytic solution due to the low cost and versatility of the support and the optimal usage of Ni and its predicted selectivity and efficiency (ca. 100% towards CO). Herein, we have used noble carbonaceous support derived from cytosine to load Ni subnanometric sites. The large heteroatom content of the support allows the stabilization of up to 11 wt% of Ni without the formation of nanoparticles through a simple impregnation plus calcination approach, where nickel promotes the stabilization of C3NOx frameworks and the oxidative support promotes a high oxidation state of nickel. EXAFS analysis points at nickel single atoms or subnanometric clusters coordinated by oxygen in the material surface. Unlike the well-known N-coordinated Ni single sites selectivity towards CO2 reduction, O-coordinated-Ni single sites (ca. 7 wt% of Ni) reduced CO2 to CO, but subnanometric clusters (11 wt% of Ni) foster the unprecedented formation of HCOOH with 27% Faradaic efficiency at − 1.4 V. Larger Ni amounts ended up on the formation of NiO nanoparticles and almost 100% selectivity towards hydrogen evolution.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107191
Nitrogen-doped carbon black supported synergistic palladium single atoms and nanoparticles for electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.For commercially viable direct methanol fuel cells, electrocatalysts play a crucial role in motivating the sluggish methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) over anode. Unfortunately, the large-scale applications of current MOR catalysts are hampered by their poor tolerance to poisoning and fast activity degradation. Herein, a unique composite catalyst comprised of partial Pd nanoparticles and partial Pd single atoms (PdNPs/Pd-Nx@C) is developed. The as-fabricated catalyst exhibits remarkable activity of 9.45 mA·cm−2 towards MOR in alkaline solution, which is 7.05 and 3.92 times that of commercial Pd/C and nanoparticle type (PdNPs@C) electrocatalysts, respectively. Impressively, the PdNPs/Pd-Nx@C shows the highest long-time stability with 90.38% and 89.8% of the initial activity retained after 3600 s chronoamperometry (CA) test and 2000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements with accelerated durability test (ADT), respectively. Combined with high-angle annular darkfield scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), X-ray adsorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, the superior performance of PdNPs/Pd-Nx@C can be ascribed to the synergistic effect from the Pd single atoms, N-doped carbon supports and Pd nanoparticles. Notably, the embedded Pd single atoms are liable to transfer electrons to the substrate due to the electronic metal-support interactions (EMSI) and the charge transfer between Pd nanoparticles and carbon supports is suppressed, inducing a weak adsorption strength of poisonous carbonous intermediate species on active Pd nanoparticles and improved poisoning tolerance in MOR process, which is verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations as well as CO-stripping voltammetry experiments. This work not only contributes the first example of a synergistic catalyst between nanoparticles and single atoms for MOR but also deepens the knowledge on the metal-support interaction.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135585
Precise constructed atomically dispersed Fe/Ni sites on porous nitrogen-doped carbon for oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Exploring highly-efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for preparation of rechargeable metal-air batteries. Herein, FeNi-mIm (guest) was loaded on the surface of ZIF-8 (host) via a novel host-guest strategy, and the resulting ZIF-8@FeNi(mIm)X precursors can be converted to FeNi SAs/N[sbnd]C catalysts with controllable structures. Robust metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived atomically dispersed Fe/Ni dual single atom electrocatalysts for ORR were developed, followed by pyrolysis of the precursors. Characterizations showed that the atomically-dispersed Fe/Ni active sites were uniformly embedded in the N-doped carbon framework. As a result, the ORR performance was obviously improved with lower half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.91 V) in alkaline media. Such improvement is mainly attributed to the synergy of fully-exposed bimetallic single atom active sites caused by the interaction of Fe/Ni 3d orbitals. The lower adsorption energy of intermediate hydroxyl groups on the active sites and the smaller ORR energy barrier were calculated by the density functional theory. The novelty FeNi SAs/N[sbnd]C catalysts showed faster ORR dynamics in the rate-determining step of four-electron transfer. The synthesis strategy reported here provides an efficient approach to construct high performance dual single-atom catalysts with fully-exposed active sites on the surface.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2022.02.080
Spherical vs. planar: Steering the electronic communication between Ru nanoparticle and single atom to boost the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity both in acid and alkaline,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Steering the electronic structure of a catalyst has been considered as an effective way to boost the electrocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a core-shell architecture comprising a Ru nanoparticle (NP) encapsulated into an oxyfullerene-like carbon cage decorated with single-atomic RuNx species anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon substrate (RuNP@RuNx-OFC/NC) was constructed. Benefiting from the efficient electronic communication between Ru NP and atomically-distributed Ru site on the carbon cage, the RuNP@RuNx-OFC/NC exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance for HER both in acid and alkaline. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that the charge transfer from Ru NP to single-atomic Ru could steer the electronic density of Ru sites and thus facilitate the adsorption of hydrogen and dissociation of water. Resultantly, such charge electronic communication effectively reduced the Gibbs free energy, leading to the improved HER activity. The present work would promote the design and construction of efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121193
Tetrahedral W4cluster confined in graphene-like C2N enables electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction from theoretical perspective,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Exploring the format of active site is essential to further the understanding of an electrocatalyst working under ambient conditions. Herein, we present a DFT study of electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (eNRR) on W4 tetrahedron embedded in graphene-like C2N (denoted as W4@C2N). Our results demonstrate that N-affinity of active sites on W4 dominate over single-atom site, rendering ∗NH2 + (H+ + e-) →∗NH3 invariably the potential-determining step (PDS) of eNRR via consecutive or distal route (U L = -0.68 V) to ammonia formation. However, ∗NHNH2 + (H+ + e-) →∗NH2NH2 has become the PDS (U L = -0.54 V) via enzymatic route towards NH2NH2 formation and thereafter desorption, making W4@C2N a potentially promising catalyst for hydrazine production from eNRR. Furthermore, eNRR is competitive with hydrogen evolution reaction (U L = -0.78 V) on W4@C2N, which demonstrated sufficient thermal stability and electric property for electrode application.",Nanotechnology,10.1088/1361-6528/ac5bb9
Density functional theory study of nitrogen-doped black phosphorene doped with monatomic transition metals as high performance electrocatalysts for N2reduction reaction,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Ammonia (NH3) is an essential resource in human production and living activities, and its demand has been rising in recent years. The catalytic synthesis of NH3 from N2 under mild conditions, inspired by biological nitrogen fixation, has piqued the interest of researchers. In this paper, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to investigate the catalytic activity, mechanism, and selectivity of the TM embedded nitrogen-doped phosphorene as high-performance nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) electrocatalysts in depth. The results show that Nb- and Mo-doped catalysts present excellent catalytic performance, with low limiting potentials of -0.41 and -0.18 V, respectively. The Mo-N3-BP catalyst, for example, not only has an extremely low overpotential (-0.02 V), but also presents superior selectivity to effectively inhibit the HER competition reaction. A deeper look into the catalytic mechanism reveals a volcano relationship between the d-band center and the catalytic activity (Mo and Nb are located near the peak of the volcano-type curve). The d-band center and charge of the metal center can be regarded as effective descriptors for NRR activity on TM embedded nitrogen-doped phosphorene electrocatalysts, which hope to serve as a guiding principle for the design of high performance NRR single-atom catalyst in the future.",Nanotechnology,10.1088/1361-6528/ac5929
Atomically Dispersed Uranium Enables an Unprecedentedly High NH3 Yield Rate,"The low NH3 yield rate is a grand challenge for electrocatalytic N2 reduction to NH3. Herein, we report the first uranium single-atom catalyst (SAC) capable of catalyzing the electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR). The uranium SAC features a low limiting potential (<0.5 V) and near-zero free energy changes for N2 adsorption and NH3 desorption. The integration of these merits enables the uranium SAC to afford an unprecedentedly high NH3 yield rate, 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than that of the Ru(0001) surface, which is widely recognized as an excellent NRR electrocatalyst. Further theoretical analysis reveals that the N2 reduction catalyzed by the uranium SAC is synergistically regulated by the d and f electrons of atomic uranium. This work proposes a promising solution (that is, atomically dispersed uranium) to the daunting challenge associated with the low NH3 yield rate, thus enabling the scalable production of NH3 via electrochemical N2 reduction.",Nano letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c01185

For the first time, the TM-sF4TCNQ monolayers have been considered for application in the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) field. Through high-throughput screening, the catalytic performance of 30 TM-sF4TCNQ (TM = 3d∼5d TMs) monolayers for eNRR was comprehensively evaluated. The Mo-, Nb-, and Tc-sF4TCNQ catalysts stand out with the onset potentials of -0.18, -0.44, and -0.54 V, respectively, through the optimal reaction paths. Our work will provide guidance for the green and sustainable development of electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c02677
Atomically Dispersed Cu Sites on Dual-Mesoporous N-Doped Carbon for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Nitrate,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The industrial Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis is extremely important in modern society. However, it is energy intensive and leads to severe pollution, which has motivated eco-friendly NH3 synthesis research. Electroreduction of contaminant nitrate ions back to NH3 is an effective complement but is still limited by low NH3 yields and nitrate-to-NH3 selectivities. In this study, the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NTRR) is carried out over a single-atom Cu catalyst. Atomically dispersed Cu sites anchored on dual-mesoporous N-doped carbon framework display excellent NTRR performance with NH3 production rate of 13.8 mol (Formula presented.) gcat−1 h−1 and NO3−-to-NH3 faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.5 % at −1.0 V. Cu−N−C catalyst can sustain continuous 120 h NTRR test in the simulated NH3 synthesis scenarios with large current density (about 200 mA cm−2) and amplified volume of NO3− solution (9 times). Theoretical calculations reveal that atomically dispersed Cu1−N4 sites reduce the energy barrier of potential-determining step in NTRR and promote the decomposition of primary intermediate in NO3−-to-N2 process.

Here, we demonstrate a novel electrocatalyst for NITRR consisting of Rh clusters and single-atoms dispersed onto Cu nanowires (NWs), which delivers a partial current density of 162 mA cm−2 for NH3 production and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93 % at −0.2 V vs. RHE. The highest ammonia yield rate reached a record value of 1.27 mmol h−1 cm−2. Detailed investigations by electron paramagnetic resonance, in situ infrared spectroscopy, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and density functional theory modeling suggest that the high activity originates from the synergistic catalytic cooperation between Rh and Cu sites, whereby adsorbed hydrogen on Rh site transfers to vicinal *NO intermediate species adsorbed on Cu promoting the hydrogenation and ammonia formation.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202202556
Constructing Cu−C Bonds in a Graphdiyne-Regulated Cu Single-Atom Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction to CH4,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Regulating intermediates through elaborate catalyst design to control the reaction direction is crucial for promoting the selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2-to-CH4. M−C (M=metal) bonds are particularly important for tuning the multi-electron reaction; however, its construction in nanomaterials is challenging. Here, via rational design of in situ anchoring of Cu SAs (single atoms) on the unique platform graphdiyne, we firstly realize the construction of a chemical bond Cu−C (GDY). In situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry and DFT calculations confirm that due to the fabrication of the Cu−C bond, during CO2 reduction, the formation of *OCHO intermediates is dominant rather than *COOH on Cu atoms, facilitating the formation of CH4. Therefore, we find that constructing the Cu−C bond in Cu SAs/GDY can supply an efficient charge transfer channel, but most importantly control the reaction intermediates and guide a more facile reaction pathway to CH4, thereby significantly boosting its catalytic performance. This work provides new insights on enhancing the selectivity for CO2RR at the atomic level.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202203569
A single atom Ir doped heterophase of a NiMoP-NiMoPxOy ultrathin layer assembled on CNTs-graphene for high-performance water splitting,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The rational construction of efficient and robust with a high-performance electrocatalyst have been required in industrial green H2 production. In this study, single atom Iridium (Ir) introduced into both phases of an amorphous NiMoPxOy and crystalline NiMoP phase generates enriched active sites with high intrinsic activity, and the catalyst material coating on the carbon nanotube interconnected graphene sheet on copper foam (Ir-NiMoP-NiMoPxOy/CNTs-Gr/Cu) serves as an electron transport pathway and improves the surface area and protective layer. The engineered material exhibits excellent electrochemical water splitting characteristics, similar to those of Ir-NiMoP-MoNiPxOy/CNTs-Gr/Cu, showing a small overpotential of 138 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 220 mV at 20 mA cm−2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The overall water splitting of Ir-NiMoP-NiMoPxOy/CNTs-Gr/Cu in 1.0 M KOH was extremely stable after 150 hours of operation at 50 mA cm−2. Density functional theory calculations show that the real active sites are Ir and Mo in the hybrid amorphous/crystalline phase of Ir-NiMoP-MoNiPxOy, providing a new pathway for designing an effective catalyst for future applications in the hydrogen production field.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta03325a
Reaction mechanism and kinetics for carbon dioxide reduction on iron-nickel Bi-atom catalysts,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is being accepted as one of the most promising strategies to convert carbon emissions to valuable chemicals and fuels. Among the various types of electrocatalysts, dual-site catalysts have emerged as a new frontier. In particular, the Ni-Fe bi-site not only plays a key role in the biological utilization of CO2 in enzymes but also shows exceptional activity and selectivity for CO evolution in the heterogeneous CO2RR. However, an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism has not been achieved. In this work, we applied the recently developed grand canonical potential kinetics (GCP-K) method to determine the reaction mechanism and kinetics of the CO2RR on Fe&Ni@g-N6. Unlike the traditional CO2RR mechanism on transition metals or single-atom catalysts, the Fe-Ni dual site is firstly passivated by strongly adsorbed *CO, and the real active site of the CO2RR cycle is at the exposed single Fe site. The predicted overall kinetics has a Uonset (10 mA cm−2) of −0.99 V to generate CO, and the maximum turnover frequency reaches 961 h−1 per site at U = −1.18 V. The competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has a greater negative onset potential and does not interfere with the CO2RR. These predictions show a reasonable agreement with the experiment. The promising performance is correlated with the down-shift and localization of the 3d electronic states of Fe atoms. Our analysis provides a defined mechanism and offers useful insight into designing efficient dual-active-site electrocatalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta02931f
Single-atom alloy with Pt-Co dual sites as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Reducing the usage of noble metals, such as platinum-based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is pressingly demanded towards the practical applications of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. One promising way is to develop Pt single atom catalysts (SACs), which, however, are plagued by their preference toward two-electron ORR pathway as well as stability issue. Herein, a single-atom alloy (SAA) catalyst with platinum-cobalt (Pt-Co) dual sites encapsulated in nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon nanotubes (Pt1Co100/N-GCNT) consisting of isolated Pt atoms decorated on the surface of Co nanoparticles was reported. Based on complementary spectroscopic characterizations and first-principle calculations, we propose that the unique Pt-Co dual sites in SAA facilitates the adsorption and dissociation of oxygen, particularly for the immobilization of OOH* intermediate and the dissociation of OH* intermediate, and thus result in high-efficiency four-electron ORR pathway. Consequently, the Pt1Co100/N-GCNT SAA catalyst achieves a mass activity of 0.81 A mg–1Pt at 0.90 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte, outperform commercial Pt/C catalyst for 5.4 times. The superior stability of the SAA catalyst was reflected by the results from the 30,000 potential-scanning cycles combined with the post characterization of the catalyst.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121112
Highly Durable and Selective Fe- and Mo-Based Atomically Dispersed Electrocatalysts for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia via Distinct and Synergized NO2- Pathways,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Aimed toward the pursuit of manufacturing ammonia in a carbon-neutral and decentralized manner, the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) not only promises an effective route for carbon-neutral ammonia synthesis but also offers potential advantages to wastewater remediation. Here, we describe the efficacy of bioinspired, atomically dispersed catalysts for the NO3RR in aqueous media via a catalytic cascade. Compared to nanoparticles with extended catalytic surfaces, atomically dispersed catalysts are largely underexplored in this field, despite their intrinsic selectivity toward mono-nitrogen species over their dinitrogen counterparts. Herein, we specifically report on a series of nitrogen-coordinated mono- and bimetallic, atomically dispersed, iron- and molybdenum-based electrocatalysts for ammonia synthesis via the NO3RR. The key role of the *NO2/NO2-intermediates was identified both computationally and experimentally, wherein the Fe-N4sites and Mo-N4/*O-Mo-N4sites carried distinct associative and dissociative adsorption of NO3-molecules, respectively. By integrating individual Fe and Mo sites on a single bimetallic catalyst, the unique reaction pathways were synergized, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 94% toward ammonia. Furthermore, the robustness of the bimetallic FeMo-N-C catalyst was highlighted by five consecutive 12 h electrolysis cycles with the Faradaic efficiency being maintained above 90% over the entire 60 h. The utilization of catalytic cascades, synergizing distinct reaction pathways on heterogeneous single-atom sites, is largely unconstrained by linear scaling relations of reaction intermediates and sheds light on designing electrocatalysts for highly selective, efficient, and durable ammonia synthesis.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.2c01367
A Stabilized Assisted Method for the Synthesis of Fe-N-C Catalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2022 The Electrochemical Society (“ECS”). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing LimitedIron-nitrogen-carbon graphitic (Fe-N-C), a noble metal-free catalyst holds a lot of promise to substitute platinum (Pt) as an efficient catalyst in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the synthesis process and the stabilization of single atoms that tend to aggregate, without jeopardizing the catalytic activity remain challenging. Here we demonstrate a stabilized assisted method for the preparation of Fe-N-C electrocatalyst by using graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheet as a template. Fe ions are absorbed on the surface of g-C3N4 and imprisoned after the addition of pyrrole, preventing Fe migration that may result in nanoparticles. During the pyrolysis, Fe atoms coordinated with N provided by g-C3N4 and pyrrole on graphitic carbon to form Fe-N-C with a metal loading of 5.4 wt%. Moreover, FeNx species were introduced in the graphitic carbon, where the coexistence of micro and mesopores were favorable to offer a larger density of active sites compared to Fe/NP without pyrrole. Fe-N-C demonstrated a good electrocatalytic performance with a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.82 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) higher than Fe/NP (0.76 V) and close to Pt/C, with a superior long stability of 85% in alkaline media after 40000 s.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1149/1945-7111/ac7260
Atomically dispersed Pt and Fe sites and Pt–Fe nanoparticles for durable proton exchange membrane fuel cells,"© 2022, The Author(s).Proton exchange membrane fuel cells convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity without emissions. The high cost and low durability of Pt-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction hinder their wide application, and the development of non-precious metal electrocatalysts is limited by their low performance. Here we design a hybrid electrocatalyst that consists of atomically dispersed Pt and Fe single atoms and Pt–Fe alloy nanoparticles. Its Pt mass activity is 3.7 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C in a fuel cell. More importantly, the fuel cell with a low Pt loading in the cathode (0.015 mgPt cm−2) shows an excellent durability, with a 97% activity retention after 100,000 cycles and no noticeable current drop at 0.6 V for over 200 hours. These results highlight the importance of the synergistic effects among active sites in hybrid electrocatalysts and provide an alternative way to design more active and durable low-Pt electrocatalysts for electrochemical devices.

Boosting Oxygen Electrocatalysis by Combining Iron Nanoparticles with Single Atoms,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The development of high-performance non-noble metal-based oxygen electrocatalysts is crucial for the practical application of zinc–air batteries. Most of them suffer from low intrinsic activity and poor stability, failing to meet the needs of practical applications. Here, we report an efficient and durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst of Fe@Fe-SAC composite (SAC stands for single atoms on carbon). A facile and ease-to-scale-up process synthesizes it. Fe single-atom and Fe nanoparticles are anchored on nitrogen-doped porous carbon, with the latter encapsulated by the graphitic shell. It exhibits appealing activity and durability in a basic electrolyte, requiring a half-wave potential of 0.805 V for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and an overpotential of only 348 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Both activities are comparable to the corresponding benchmarking electrocatalyst of Pt/C for ORR and IrO2 for OER. The superior activities are attributed to the strong electronic interaction between metal single-atom and nanoparticles. The favorable stability is ascribed to the physical encapsulation of carbon coatings on nanoparticles. This work presents a feasible scheme for designing and large-scale preparation of high-performance non-noble metal-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.",Catalysts,10.3390/catal12060585
Exploiting the Synergistic Electronic Interaction between Pt-Skin Wrapped Intermetallic PtCo Nanoparticles and Co-N-C Support for Efficient ORR/EOR Electrocatalysis in a Direct Ethanol Fuel Cell,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The development of low-Pt catalysts with high activity and durability is critical for fuel cells. Here, Pt-skin wrapped sub-5 nm PtCo intermetallic nanoparticles are successfully mounted on single atom Co-N-C support by exploiting the barrier effect of Co-anchor. According to a collaborative experimental and computational investigation, the increased oxygen reduction reaction activity of PtCo/Co-N-C arises from the direct electron transfer from PtCo to Co-N-C, and the resulting optimal d-band center of Pt. Owing to such unique electronic structure interaction and synergistic effect, the specific and mass activities of PtCo/Co-N-C are up to 4.20 mA cm−2 and 2.71 A mgPt−1, respectively, with barely degraded stability after 40 000 CV cycles. The PtCo/Co-N-C also exhibits outstanding activity as an ethanol electrocatalyst. This work shows a new and effective route to boost the overall efficiency of direct ethanol fuel cells in acidic media by integrating intermetallic low-Pt alloys and single atom carbon support.",Small,10.1002/smll.202202071
Co single atoms and nanoparticles dispersed on N-doped carbon nanotube as high-performance catalysts for Zn-air batteries,"© 2022, Youke Publishing Co.,Ltd.Diminishing the size of active sites in catalysts is promising to improve the kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and reduce the cost of metal–air batteries. However, the facile preparation of high-performance catalysts with nanoscale active sites still suffers from great challenge. Herein, we report a facile template-free strategy to fabricate Co single atoms and nanoparticles dispersed on porous N-doped carbon nanotube (Co-NCNT) by the pyrolysis of the composites of metal–organic complexes and porous carbon nanotube. Different from the conventional strategy, the precursor metal–organic complexes in this work were prepared under mild conditions and used without complex purification procedures. Compared with the pristine carbon nanotube, N-doped carbon nanotube with abundant mesopores contribute to the formation of nanoscale Co sites. This resultant electrocatalyst Co-NCNT shows an impressive ORR half-wave potential of 0.87 V in alkaline solution, outperforming that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). The catalyst Co-NCNT displays high tolerance to strong alkali solution, endowing the aqueous Zn-air batteries with high discharge voltages and power density. In addition, the specific capacity achieves 803 mAh·gZn−1 under a current density of 10 mA·cm−1.

Copper-involved highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction in both alkaline and acidic media,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a significant role in many renewable energy storage and conversion devices. Various kinds of transition metal-based electrocatalysts were developed to promote the ORR. Among them, Cu-based catalysts were rarely studied due to their intrinsic de-active feature in bulk state, especially in acidic medium. In this work, single Cu atoms and Cu clusters-anchored nitrogen-doped porous carbons are rationally developed. As electrocatalysts for ORR, half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.88 V and diffusion limiting current density (JL) of 5.88 mA cm−2 can be achieved in 0.1 M KOH, exceeding the most of reported non-precious catalysts and commercial Pt/C. Significantly, as-prepared catalysts exhibit the state-of-the-art performance in acidic medium among all of reported Cu-based catalysts with the E1/2 of 0.80 V and JL of 5.86 mA cm−2. Theoretical calculations indicate that the nitrogen-coordinated Cu atoms are the dominating active sites, and the neighboring Cu cluster increases the electron density of d orbitals of single-Cu-atom, which weakened the O-O interaction, thus further boost ORR performance. This work not only presents a facile strategy to fabricate efficient catalysts but also identifies the great potential of Cu based materials for ORR in both alkaline and acidic media.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135377
Nitrogen doped porous carbon polyhedral supported Fe and Ni dual-metal single-atomic catalysts: template-free and metal ligand-free sysnthesis with microwave-assistance and d-band center modulating for boosted ORR catalysis in zinc-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Constructing dual-metal single-atom catalysts (DSAs) now stands for a unique and worthwhile strategy for developing high-efficiency electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the facile synthesis of DSAs uniformly located on nitrogen porous carbon materials is still challenging. Herein, Fe and Ni dual-metal single-atomic active sites uniformly located on nitrogen doped porous carbon polyhedrals (FeNi-DSAs-PNCH) are successfully prepared by a facile and rapid microwave-assisted adsorption and subsequent pyrolysis process with free template and free metal ligand. The FeNi-DSAs-PNCH catalyst exhibits boosted ORR activity and long time stability. Experimental investigations and density functional theory calculation results verify that, besides the hierarchical porous structure, large specific surface area and abundant catalytic active sites, the adjacent Ni-Nx atomic sites can modulate the d-band center of Fe-Nx single atomic active centers and balance the adsorption–desorption affinities to O2 molecules and oxygen-containing intermediates on Fe-Nx, thus leading to an superior ORR activity with a more positive half-wave potential (0.89 V vs. RHE) than the single Fe or Ni atomic catalyst and the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, with FeNi-DSAs-PNCH as the air cathode and zinc foil as the anode, an assembled Zn-air battery exhibits a higher open-circuit voltage of 1.48 V and a larger specific capacity of 802.18 mAh g−1 than that of the Pt/C-based Zn-air battery (1.37 V and 664.78 mAh g−1, respectively). This work develops a convenient strategy for preparing dual-metal single-atomic cataysts as promising substitutes for the commercial Pt/C catalysts in the practical energy conversion applications, and also offers experimental and theoretical guidance for rational designing and improvement of ORR and other catalysts by tailoring the d-band center of the active sites.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135295
"A hierarchically ordered porous Fe, N, S tri-doped carbon electrocatalyst with densely accessible Fe-Nx active sites and uniform sulfur-doping for efficient oxygen reduction reaction","© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Doping Fe[sbnd]N[sbnd]C catalysts with heteroatoms has been widely recognized as a most promising way to improve the electrocatalytic activity to achieve the replacement of Pt-based electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, it is still a challenge to combine delicate control of the catalyst structure with heteroatom-doping to achieve optimal electrocatalytic efficiency. Herein, a strategy of combining chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with dual-template cooperative pyrolysis was rationally designed to synthesize the novel electrocatalyst with densely isolated single Fe atoms scattered on hierarchically ordered porous N and S codoped carbon (ISA-Fe/HOPNSC).

As cathode catalyst in Zn-air battery, ISA-Fe/HOPNSC also provides much better maximum power density (210.7 mW cm−2) and specific capacity (796.7 mAh gZn−1) than those of Pt/C (112.6 mW cm−2 and 712.6 mAh gZn−1).

Pt-Co single atom alloy catalysts: Accelerated water dissociation and hydrogen evolution by strain regulation,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesThe alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Pt-based catalysts is largely limited by the slow water dissociation kinetics. Pt-based single atom alloy catalysts (SAAC) with water dissociation sites have been demonstrated as excellent alkaline HER catalysts. However, the regulation of their activity and stability at the atomic scale is still a great challenge. Herein, the kinetic and stability issues are successfully resolved via engineering the electronic structure of Pt-Co SAAC by Au-induced tensile strain. The atomic dispersion of Co into the Pt shell was confirmed by extended X-ray absorption fine structure and the electronic structure and catalytic HER performance was modulated by the tensile strain induced by the Pt shell thickness. An inverse volcano-type relation between HER activity and surface strain was found. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Au-induced tensile strain on Pt-Co shell can not only boost the adsorption and dissociation kinetics of water at Co site by upshifting the d-band and promoting the electron transfer, but also downshift the d-band center of Pt in Pt-Co shell, leading to optimized H* adsorption/desorption. The champion catalyst provides an overpotential of only 14 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. This work not only provides an effective strategy for the construction of single-atom alloy electrocatalysts for high performance toward alkaline HER but also sheds light on the understanding of the reaction mechanism at the atomic level.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.12.045

Atomically miniaturized bi-phase IrOx/Ir catalysts loaded on N-doped carbon nanotubes for high-performance Li-CO2 batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Li-CO2 batteries are bifunctional, spontaneously storing energy and fixing environmental CO2 without external electricity. Identifying efficient catalysts that can accelerate the reversible formation and decomposition of the insulating carbonate products formed on the electrode remains challenging. To overcome this limitation, we atomically dispersed IrOx/Ir bi-phase particles as single-atom catalysts (SACs) on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) and introduced them to facilitate a reversible Li-CO2 reaction with low overpotential and stable cycle performance for 120 cycles. The IrOx/Ir SACs were successfully minimized to an atomic scale of 4 Å and formed unique surface oxides via dangling bonds on the atomic Ir catalyst, enhancing the surface catalytic activities. The N sites doped on the carbon nanotubes increased the electronic conductivity and provided favorable nucleation sites for Ir loading. The Li-CO2 cells employing IrOx/Ir SACs loaded on NCNTs exhibited improved cell performance, reduced polarization, lower charge transfer resistance, and higher stable cyclability compared to cells employing larger-sized Ir particles on NCNTs. The reversible Li-CO2 reaction mechanism facilitated by the IrOx/Ir SAC-loaded NCNT catalyst is explained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that demonstrated that the bond of SACs with (Li+ + e−) is strong and forms products, whereas the bond with is weak and evolves products reversibly. This strategy to atomically minimize noble metal catalysts may facilitate the realization of high-performance and economical Li-CO2 batteries to achieve carbon-negativity targets.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta02234f

The prepared NiFe@C 5:3 SACs showed excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 322 mV and 438 mV for current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 100 mA/cm2, respectively. The Tafel slope of NiFe@C 5:3 was as small as 87.6 mV/dec, indicating fast charge transfer of NiFe@C 5:3 during OER process, which was also confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectra with Rct = 18.07 Ωcm2.

Screening of transition metal single-atom catalysts supported by a WS2 monolayer for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction: insights from activity trend and descriptor,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), as an alternative green technology to the Haber-Bosch process, can efficiently synthesize ammonia under ambient conditions and has a reduced carbon footprint. Here we systematically investigate the NRR activity and selectivity of transition metal (TM) single-atom catalyst (SAC) anchored WS2 monolayers (TM@WS2) by means of first-principles calculations and microkinetic modeling. The construction of the reaction activity trend and the identification of an activity descriptor, namely *N2H adsorption energy, facilitate the efficient screening and rational design of SACs with high activity. Manipulating the adsorption strength of the pivotal *N2H intermediate is a potential strategy for enhancing NRR activity. Utilizing the limiting potential difference of NRR and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as a selectivity descriptor, we screen three SACs with excellent activity and selectivity toward NRR, i.e., Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2 with favorable limiting potentials of -0.44 V, -0.38 V and -0.69 V. By using the explicit H9O4+ model, the kinetic barriers of the rate-determining steps (0.47 eV-1.15 eV) of the solvated proton transfer on the screened SACs are found to be moderate, indicative of a kinetically feasible process. Microkinetic modeling shows that the turnover frequencies of N2 reduction to NH3 on Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2 are 1.52 × 105, 8.21 × 102 and 4.17 × 10−4 per s per site at 400 K, achieving fast reaction rates. The coexistence of empty and occupied 5d orbitals of candidate SACs is beneficial for σ donation and π* backdonation, endowing them with extraordinary N2 adsorption and activation. Moreover, the screened SACs possess good dispersity and thermodynamic stability. Our work provides a promising solution for the efficient screening and rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts toward the NRR.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d2cp01446g
Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-Derived Copper Single Atom Anchored on Nitrogen-Doped Porous Carbon as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction toward Zn-Air Battery,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Here, copper single atoms anchored on nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Cu-N/PC) derived from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were demonstrated. Specifically, as a nitrogen-rich bridge molecule, tubular g-C3N4(TCN) can trap free Cu ions through the electrostatic interaction in the initial stage. Then, Cu-ion-doped TCN can be used to regulate the content of copper and nitrogen doping, the electronic structure, as well as the specific surface area and pore diameter of Cu-N/PC. As a result, the high density of exposed Cu-N4active sites and the high level of porosity in Cu-N/PC may significantly enhance the ORR activity with a more positive onset potential (E0= 0.97 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and half-wave potential (E1/2= 0.88 V) than the commercially available Pt/C catalyst (E0= 0.94 V, E1/2= 0.85 V). Furthermore, the homemade Zn-air battery (ZAB) equipped with Cu-N/PC is able to deliver excellent performance, including a peak power density of 215.8 mW cm-2and a specific capacity of 704.9 mAh g-1based on Zn anode, outperforming the Pt/C catalyst.

"TM3 (TM = V, Fe, Mo, W) single-cluster catalyst confined on porous BN for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction","© 2021Confined metal clusters as sub-nanometer reactors for electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (eNRR) have received increasing attention due to the unique metal-metal interaction and higher activity than single-atom catalysts. Herein, the inspiration of the superior capacitance and unique microenvironment with regular surface cavities of the porous boron nitride (p-BN) nanosheets, we systematically studied the catalytic activity for NRR of transition-metal single-clusters in the triplet form (V3, Fe3, Mo3 and W3) confined in the surface cavities of the p-BN sheets by spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations. After a two-step screening strategy, Mo3@p-BN was found to have high catalytic activity and selectivity with a rather low limiting potential (–0.34 V) for the NRR. The anchored Mo3 single-cluster can be stably embedded on the surface cavities of the substrate preventing the diffusion of the active Mo atoms. More importantly, the Mo atoms in the Mo3 single-cluster would act as “cache” to accelerate electron transfer between active metal centers and nitrogen-containing intermediates via the intimate Mo-Mo interactions. The cooperation of Mo atoms can also provide a large number of occupied and unoccupied d orbitals to make the ""donation–backdonation"" mechanism more effective. This work not only provides a quite promising electrocatalyst for NRR, but also brings new insights into the rational design of triple-atom NRR catalysts.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology,10.1016/j.jmst.2021.08.052
A three-dimensional ordered honeycomb nanostructure anchored with Pt-N active sites via self-assembly of a block copolymer: an efficient electrocatalyst towards the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryMesoporous Pt-containing nanocomposites with well-organized pores are desirable for fuel cells as well as sensors, electronics, and various chemical reactions. However, it remains challenging to construct three-dimensional (3D) ordered honeycomb-like (OHC) nanostructures with Pt species anchored in the mesopores. Herein, we show for the first time an in situ strategy of developing an N-doped ordered honeycomb (N-OHC) nanopattern with well-dispersed Pt-N2 moieties by using the self-assembly of a block copolymer (BCP). The as-mentioned Pt including Pt single atoms (SAs) and Pt ∼2.5 nm ultrafine nanoparticles (NPs) was hierarchically located on the inner walls and the outer surfaces of the N-OHC mesopores (Pt/N-OHC), forming well-dispersed Pt-N active sites and showing efficient catalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By changing the film thickness of the pristine Pt/BCP template, double-layered Pt/N-OHC could be designed and the ORR activity could be correspondingly improved, for which a current density of 1.60 A cm−2@0.6 V and a peak power density of 1.07 W cm−2 were observed at a very low Pt-loading of 0.04 mg cm−2, better than 1.21 A cm−2@0.6 V and 0.79 W cm−2 of the commercial Pt/C catalyst at a Pt-loading of 0.15 mg cm−2. The electron donating behavior of Pt-N2 and the pathway for O2 reduction were investigated via the density functional theory (DFT) computation. The electron transfer from Pt to N gave rise to the formation of Pt-N covalent bonds, which resulted in a lower d band center and a weaker O adsorption energy and endowed the Pt/N-OHCs with enhanced ORR activity.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta00752e
Theoretical Screening of Transition Metal-N4-Doped Graphene for Electroreduction of Nitrate,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is an advantageous conversion technology for nitrate removal and ammonia synthesis. Single-atom catalysts, owing to their utmost metal atom utilization efficiency, are promising electrocatalysts for NO3RR but are rarely investigated in systematic ways. In this study, a theoretical screening is performed on transition metal-N4-doped graphene (TM-N4/C) as active and selective electrocatalysts for NO3RR, where detailed reaction mechanisms and activity origins are explored. Volcano plots of activity trends show that Cu- and Pt-N4/C are highly active for NO3RR following the NH3and N2formation pathways, respectively, whose activities can be attributed to the optimal NO and N adsorptions. In addition, a contour plot of selectivity trend shows that Re- and Pt-N4/C are highly selective toward NH3and N2formations, respectively. This work provides theoretical insights into the rational design of TM-N4/C catalysts for NO3RR and opportunities for efficient nitrate removal and ammonia synthesis strategies.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.2c00307
Structure-Performance Descriptors and the Role of the Axial Oxygen Atom on M-N4-C Single-Atom Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2Reduction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Revealing and characterizing the catalytic sites, along with elucidating a convenient activity descriptor, can provide essential guidance in determining efficient electrocatalytic catalysts for the CO2reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this work, the mechanism of CO2reduction to methane (CH4) on 23 transition metal-coordinated nitrogen-doped carbon M-N4-C single-atom catalysts (SACs) was studied by density functional theory calculations, a step forward to revealing the effects of the axial O atom (M-N4O-C) on their catalytic activity. The electrocatalytic reduction activity of CO2over M-N4-C SACs is strongly dependent on the outmost d-shell electron numbers and electronegativity of the selected metals. The introduction of the axial O atom changes the coordination structure of the central metal atoms, which not only improves the stability of M-N4O-C SACs (especially electrochemical stability) but also affects the adsorption strength of intermediate species and then improves or reduces the catalytic activity, which depends on the intrinsic properties of the metal atoms. More importantly, by considering the comprehensive effects of the number of outmost d-shell electrons, the electronegativity, coordinate numbers, and bonding length of the central metal atom and the nearest neighbor atom, a descriptor (ψ) based on the intrinsic properties of materials was developed to correlate the catalytic activity. The volcano-shaped relationships between the ψ and limiting potentials were well established. In particular, five SACs (Mn-N4-C, Cr-N4-C, Os-N4O-C, Ru-N4O-C, and Rh-N4O-C) close to the summit of the volcano were screened. Based on this descriptor, the catalyst activity can be predicted directly from the characteristics of the material instead of the expensive calculation of adsorption energies. This work is of great significance for understanding the mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2RR and the design of efficient and stable electrocatalysts.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.2c00429
Engineering Low-Coordination Single-Atom Cobalt on Graphitic Carbon Nitride Catalyst for Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Although single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been at the vanguard of energy conversion research, the selection of suitable substrates and single-atom specification permits remains ambiguous. Herein, we fabricated Co-g-C3N4/rGO SACs (Co-CNG) by coupling the suitable single-atom Co with a promising substrate of g-C3N4/rGO. Remarkably, Co-CNG exhibits even comparable HER performance (10 mA cm-2at ∼47 mV) with commercially available Pt/C (10 mA cm-2at ∼48 mV) and outperformed non-noble transition-metal SACs under alkaline conditions since its mass activity is about 4 times that of Pt/C with the long-term durability of 500 h. Athena fitting of Co-CNG was conducted, revealing its two types of coordination structure, including 20% of Co-N and 80% of Co-3N. Notably, the Co-N coordination structure is responsible for boosting HER due to its downshift d-band center, unique electronic structures, and low free energy barriers based on density functional theory. This study not only reveals that Co-CNG shows HER performance due to its unique SACs coordination of Co-N but also proves a way for catalyst optimization by specifically coordination engineering for particular applications.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.2c01253
Pt-Ru Dimer Electrocatalyst with Electron Redistribution for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Dual-atom catalysts (DACs) have attracted considerable interest since they utilize adjacent metal centers in the metal(I)-metal(II) dimer structure to achieve functionality complementarity and more flexible active sites compared to single-atom catalysts (SACs). Herein, we report that the synergistic effect and electron redistribution effect in the Pt1Ru1dimer can simultaneously accelerate the H2generation and improve the catalyst's activity. The as-developed Pt1Ru1/NMHCS-A exhibits a quite low overpotential (η10) of 22 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, a large mass activity of 3.49 A mg-1at 50 mV overpotential, a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 74.14 H2s-1at 200 mV overpotential, and a slight increment of 3 mV for η10after 10,000 consecutive cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4solution, greatly outperforming the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C benchmark and nanoparticle counterparts. The detailed spectroscopic investigations and theoretical calculations confirm the formation of a C1-Pt-Ru-N2coordination structure in Pt1Ru1/NMHCS-A and reveal the electron redistribution effect of Ru on the Pt atom. With the Ru atom tuning the electron redistribution, the Pt atom acting as the active site shows strong abilities to adsorb and reduce the proton, thus leading to the optimal HER activity. Our work provides constructive guidance for the fabrication of metal(I)-metal(II) dimers and the precise regulation of their electronic structures to achieve excellent catalytic activities.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.2c00851
Inhibited Surface Diffusion of High-Entropy Nano-Alloys for the Preparation of 3D Nanoporous Graphene with High Amounts of Single Atom Dopants,"© 2022 by the authors.Nitrogen- and metal-atom-doped graphene are very promising electrocatalysts for many renewable energy conversion reactions such as oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). To maximize the bifunctional or multifunctional catalytic performance, increasing the doping amount of both nonmetal nitrogen and metals on large-surface-area free-standing 3D porous graphene is very desirable. Herein, we design and prepare 3D bicontinuous nitrogen and noble-metal single atoms/clusters-doped small-pore-size nanoporous graphene by a CVD process using a designed 12-component ultrahigh-entropy nanoporous alloy template, which has greatly inhibited surface diffusion even under high temperatures of 800-1000 °C because of the incorporation of a suitable amount of high-melting-point metals. With a small-pore size of ∼16.7 nm and a high curvature, the 3D nanoporous graphene is able to host/stabilize a high amount of N (5.88 at. %) and metal single atoms/clusters (Au, Pt, and Ir), which are in situ anchored on graphene during the removal of the nanoporous template. As a result, the obtained 3D graphene-based composite exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities toward both ORR and OER in both alkaline and acidic media. This work demonstrates a scalable and economic route to prepare metal- and nonmetal-codoped 3D graphene with ultrasmall porosity for different electrochemical applications.",ACS Materials Letters,10.1021/acsmaterialslett.2c00245
"Three dimensional self-supporting Co, N, S co-doped porous carbon derived from paulownia wood for Li-O2 batteries 锂-氧气电池用泡桐木衍生三维自支撑Co、N、S共掺杂多孔炭","© 2022, Editorial Board of CIESC Journal. All right reserved.Lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries are considered as the most promising new generation energy storage devices because of their high theoretical energy density and environmental friendliness. However, large overpotential, low practical energy density and poor cycle life are the huge obstacles to their practical application. Since the insoluble and insulating discharge products (Li2O2) gradually form on the surface or in the pores of cathode during the discharging process, these products will block the diffusion channel of O2/electrolyte and cover the catalytic active sites. In addition, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) require noble-metal-based materials as catalyst to reduce the overpotential and achieve high electrochemcial efficiency. However, high cost and scarcity of the noble-metal catalysts hinder their large scale applications. Development of economically viable and highly efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts is extremely urgent, especially for heteroatom-doped carbons as the most promising candidates. In this paper, a novel Co, N and S co-doped three-dimensional self-standing porous carbon (wd-NSC) was prepared as cathode for Li-O2 battery using melamine and thiourea as nitrogen and sulfur sources via one-step pyrolysis of paulownia wood in NaCl/CoCl2 mixed molten salt medium. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results found that the wd-NSC inherited the original vertical channel structure of paulownia wood, and formed porous carbon fiber network on the surface and inside the channels of wd-NSC. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that N and S were successfully doped into the C skeleton, while Co might exist in the form of single atom or clusters. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms showed that the wd-NSC possess hierarchical porous structure with pore sizes ranging from micropore to macropore. Raman spectra certified that the introduction of S increased the defect degree of wd-NSC. At a current density of 0.05mA/cm2, the discharge specific capacity of wd-NSC reached to 12.83mA·h/cm2, and exhibited a good rate capability and cycling stability (at a current density of 0.1mA/cm2 and a limited capacity of 0.5mA·h/cm2, the cell can maintain 125 cycles). The excellent electrochemical performance of wd-NSC in the Li-O2 battery could be attributed to the synergistic effect of three-dimensional hierarchical porous structure and Co, N, S heteroatoms co-doping. The above results demonstrated that this study provided a promising strategy to produce efficiency and low-cost cathodes for practical application in Li-O2 batteries.",Huagong Jinzhan/Chemical Industry and Engineering Progress,10.16085/j.issn.1000-6613.2021-1011
Electronic Structure Engineering of Single-Atom Ru Sites via Co–N4 Sites for Bifunctional pH-Universal Water Splitting,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.The development of bifunctional water-splitting electrocatalysts that are efficient and stable over a wide range of pH is of great significance but challenging. Here, an atomically dispersed Ru/Co dual-sites catalyst is reported anchored on N-doped carbon (Ru/Co–N–C) for outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The Ru/Co–N–C catalyst requires the overpotential of only 13 and 23 mV for HER, 232 and 247 mV for OER to deliver a current density of 10 mA cmgeo−2 in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 1 m KOH, respectively, outperforming benchmark catalysts Pt/C and RuO2. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Co–N4 sites into Ru/Co–N–C efficiently modify the electronic structure of Ru by enlarging Ru–O covalency and increasing Ru electron density, which in turn optimize the bonding strength between oxygen/hydrogen intermediate species with Ru sites, thereby enhancing OER and HER performance. Furthermore, the incorporation of Co–N4 sites induces electron redistribution around Ru–N4, thus enhancing corrosion–resistance of Ru/Co–N–C during acid and alkaline electrolysis. The Ru/Co–N–C has been applied in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer and steady operation is demonstrated at a high current density of 450 mA cmgeo−2 for 330 h.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202110103
Atomically Dispersed Ni-N3 Sites on Highly Defective Micro-Mesoporous Carbon for Superior CO2 Electroreduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Direct electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO product powered by renewable electricity is widely advocated as an emerging strategy for alleviating CO2 emissions while addressing global energy issues. However, the development of low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts with high Faradaic efficiency for CO production (FECO) and high current density remains a grand challenge. Herein, a robust single nickel atomic site electrocatalyst, which features isolated and dense single atomic Ni-N3 sites anchored on highly defective hierarchically micro-mesoporous carbon (Ni-SAs/HMMNC-800), to enable enhanced charge transport and more exposed active sites for catalyzing electrochemical CO2-to-CO conversion, is reported. The Ni-SAs/HMMNC-800 catalyst achieves excellent activity and selectivity with high FECO values of >90% throughout a wide potential range (the FECO reaches 99.5% at −0.7 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and a CO partial current density as high as 13.0 mA cm−2 at −0.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, as well as a far outstanding durability during long-term continuous operation, indicating a superior CO2 electroreduction performance than that of other reference samples and most of previously reported carbon-based single atom electrocatalysts. Experimental and density functional theory calculations reveal that atomic Ni-N3 coordination sites coupled adjacent defects are favorable to significantly enhancing the formation of COOH* reaction intermediates while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, thereby enhancing the electrocatalytic activity for CO2-to-CO reduction. Notably, this work provides a valuable new prospect for designing and synthesizing efficient and cost-effective single atom CO2 electroreduction catalysts for practical applications.",Small,10.1002/smll.202107997
Synergic Reaction Kinetics over Adjacent Ruthenium Sites for Superb Hydrogen Generation in Alkaline Media,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Ruthenium (Ru)-based electrocatalysts as platinum (Pt) alternatives in catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are promising. However, achieving efficient reaction processes on Ru catalysts is still a challenge, especially in alkaline media. Here, the well-dispersed Ru nanoparticles with adjacent Ru single atoms on carbon substrate (Ru1,n-NC) is demonstrated to be a superb electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. The obtained Ru1,n-NC exhibits ultralow overpotential (14.8 mV) and high turnover frequency (1.25 H2 s-1 at −0.025 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), much better than the commercial 40 wt.% Pt/C. The analyses reveal that Ru nanoparticles and single sites can promote each other to deliver electrons to the carbon substrate. Eventually, the electronic regulations bring accelerated water dissociation and reduced energy barriers of hydroxide/hydrogen desorption on adjacent Ru sites, then an optimized reaction kinetics for Ru1,n-NC is obtained to achieve superb hydrogen generation in alkaline media. This work provides a new insight into the catalyst design in simultaneous optimizations of the elementary steps to obtain ideal HER performance in alkaline media.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202110604
Polyhedral Carbon Anchored on Carbon Nanosheet with Abundant Atomic Fe-Nx Moieties for Oxygen Reduction,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Materials Interfaces published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Carbon-based single-atom iron electrocatalysts with nitrogen coordination (CSAIN) have recently shown enormous promise to replace the costly Pt for boosting the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, there remains a great challenge to achieve highly efficient CSAIN catalysts for the ORR in acidic electrolytes. Herein, a novel CSAIN catalyst is synthesized by pyrolyzing a precursor mixture consisting of metal–organic framework and conductive polymer hybrid. After pyrolysis at a high temperature, the CSAIN with a structure of carbon nanosheet supported polyhedral carbon is achieved, where the unique structure endows CSAIN with expediting electron transfer and mass transport, as well as largely exposed surface to host atomically dispersed iron active sites. As a result, the optimal CSAIN catalyst shows a high ORR activity with its half-wave potential of 0.77 V (vs RHE) and a Tafel slope of 74.1 mV dec–1, which are comparable to that of commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.80 V and 81.9 mV dec–1).",Advanced Materials Interfaces,10.1002/admi.202200276
Engineering the Morphology and Microenvironment of a Graphene-Supported Co-N-C Single-Atom Electrocatalyst for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Graphene-supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising alternatives to precious metals for catalyzing the technologically important hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but their performances are limited by the low intrinsic activity and insufficient mass transport. Herein, a highly HER-active graphene-supported Co-N-C SAC is reported with unique design features in the morphology of the substrate and the microenvironment of the single metal sites: i) the crumpled and scrolled morphology of the graphene substrate circumvents the issues encountered by stacked nanoplatelets, resulting in improved exposure of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces (≈10 times enhancement); ii) the in-plane holes in graphene preferentially orientate the Co atoms at the edge sites with low-coordinated Co-N3 configuration that exhibits enhanced intrinsic activity (≈2.6 times enhancement compared to the conventional Co-N4 moiety), as evidenced by detailed experiments and density functional theory calculations. As a result, this catalyst exhibits significantly improved HER activity with an overpotential (η) of merely 82 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 59.0 mV dec−1 and a turnover frequency of 0.81 s−1 at η = 100 mV, ranking it among the best Co-N-C SACs.",Small,10.1002/smll.202201139
Role of the Metal Atom in a Carbon-Based Single-Atom Electrocatalyst for Li-S Redox Reactions,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Carbon-based single metal atom catalysts (SACs) are being extensively investigated to improve the kinetics of the Li–S redox reaction, which is greatly important for batteries with cell-level energy densities >500 W h kg-1. However, there are contradictory reports regarding the electrocatalytic activities of the different metal atoms and the role of the metal atom in Li-S chemistry still remains unclear. This is due to the complex relationship between the catalytic behavior and the structure of carbon-based SACs. Here, the catalytic behavior and active-site geometry, oxidation state, and the electronic structure of different metal centers (Fe/Co/Ni) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene, and having similar physicochemical characteristics, are studied. Combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and electrochemical analysis, it is revealed that the coordination-geometry and oxidation state of the metal atoms are modified when interacting with sulfur species. This interaction is strongly dependent on the hybridization of metal 3d and S p-orbitals. A moderate hybridization with the Fermi level crossing the metal 3d band is more favorable for Li-S redox reactions. This study thus provides a fundamental understanding of how metal atoms in SACs impact Li-S redox behavior and offers new guidelines to develop highly active catalytic materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.",Small,10.1002/smll.202200395
Engineering the Local Coordination Environment and Density of FeN4 Sites by Mn Cooperation for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single atom sites (SAS) of FeN4 are clarified as one of the most active components for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Effective strategies by engineering the local coordination environment and site density of FeN4 sites are crucial to further enhance the electrocatalytic ORR performance. Herein, the integration of a second metal of Mn with Fe to construct Fe&Mn/N-C catalysts with enhanced density of FeN4 active sites and modulated electronic structure is reported. The formation of MnN4 centers modulates the local environment of FeN4 sites and reserves more FeN4 embedded in carbon substrate by forming the possible FeN4-O-MnN4 configurations. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the overall energy barrier of ORR is decreased over the FeN4-O-MnN4 moieties. Therefore, the Fe&Mn/N-C catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR performance both in alkaline and acidic solution (half-wave potentials are 0.904 and 0.781 V). This work provides an effective strategy by modulating the local electronic structure and density of FeN4 active sites to improve the ORR activity and stability through Mn cooperation.",Small,10.1002/smll.202200911
Large-Scale Synthesis of Spinel NixMn3-xO4 Solid Solution Immobilized with Iridium Single Atoms for Efficient Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Seawater electrolysis not only affords a promising approach to produce clean hydrogen fuel but also alleviates the bottleneck of freshwater feeds. Here, a novel strategy for large-scale preparing spinel NixMn3-xO4 solid solution immobilized with iridium single-atoms (Ir-SAs) is developed by the sol–gel method. Benefitting from the surface-exposed Ir-SAs, Ir1/Ni1.6Mn1.4O4 reveals boosted oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, achieving overpotentials of 330 and 350 mV at current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm–2 in alkaline seawater. Moreover, only a cell voltage of 1.50 V is required to reach 500 mA cm–2 with assembled Ir1/Ni1.6Mn1.4O4‖Pt/C electrode pair under the industrial operating condition. The experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations highlight the effect of Ir-SAs on improving the intrinsic OER activity and facilitating surface charge transfer kinetics, and evidence the energetically stabilized *OOH and the destabilized chloride ion adsorption in Ir1/Ni1.6Mn1.4O4.

Interfacial engineering of heterogeneous molecular electrocatalysts using ionic liquids towards efficient hydrogen peroxide production,"© 2022 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of SciencesEfficient and selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts are critical to realizing decentralized H2O2 production and utilization. Here we demonstrate a facile interfacial engineering strategy using a hydrophobic ionic liquid (IL, i.e., [BMIM][NTF2]) to boost the performance of a nitrogen coordinated single atom cobalt catalyst (i.e., cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) supported on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). We find a strong correlation between the ORR performance of CoPc/CNT and the thickness of its IL coatings. Detailed characterization revealed that a higher O2 solubility (2.12 × 10−3 mol/L) in the IL compared to aqueous electrolytes provides a local O2 enriched surface layer near active catalytic sites, enhancing the ORR thermodynamics. Further, the hydrophobic IL can efficiently repel the as-synthesized H2O2 molecules from the catalyst surface, preventing their fast decomposition to H2O, resulting in improved H2O2 selectivity. Compared to CoPc/CNT without IL coatings, the catalyst with an optimal ~8 nm IL coating can deliver a nearly 4 times higher mass specific kinetic current density and 12.5% higher H2O2 selectivity up to 92%. In a two-electrode electrolyzer test, the optimal catalyst exhibits an enhanced productivity of 3.71 molH2O2 gcat–1 h–1, and robust stability. This IL-based interfacial engineering strategy may also be extended to many other electrochemical reactions by carefully tailoring the thickness and hydrophobicity of IL coatings.",Chinese Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63946-3
Platinum single atom catalysts for hydrogen isotope separation during hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Electrolysis of water is widely used for hydrogen isotope separation and the development of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts with high selectivity and activity is of key importance.

Promoting Electrochemical CO2 Reduction via Boosting Activation of Adsorbed Intermediates on Iron Single-Atom Catalyst,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom catalysts show great promise as non-precious electrocatalysts for CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2ER). However, it is still challenging to gain a fundamental understanding of the complicated dynamic behavior of CO2 activation to achieve high product selectivity. Herein, the authors report an unusual iron single-atom catalyst, containing atomically dispersed Fe–N4 species and Fe3C nanoparticles (NPs) (Fe3C|Fe1N4). Having a fragmental-rock-shaped nanocarbon architecture, isolated Fe–N4 sites uniformly disperse with adjacent Fe3C NPs (<30 nm) in a carbon matrix. Benefiting from the strong coupling effect between Fe3C and Fe1N4 and unique spatial nanostructure, Fe3C|Fe1N4 displays exceptional CO2ER activity with a low onset potential of −0.3 V and high Faradaic efficiency of 94.6% at −0.5 V for CO production, acting as one of the most active Fe–N–C catalysts and even exceeding most other carbon supported non-precious metal NPs. Experimental observations discover that the excellent CO2ER activity of Fe3C|Fe1N4 catalyst is attributable to the presence of Fe3C NPs that optimizes JCO of the coexisted Fe–N4 active sites. In situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the Fe3C NPs strengthen the adsorption of CO2 on the isolated Fe–N4 sites to accelerate the formation of *COOH intermediate, and hence enhance the whole CO2ER performance.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202110174
Uncovering electrocatalytic conversion mechanisms from Li2S2 to Li2S: Generalization of computational hydrogen electrode,"© 2022Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have been strongly considered as promising next-generation batteries due to their significant advantages on theoretical energy density. However, the practical application of Li–S batteries are seriously impeded by the sluggish conversion reaction from Li2S2 to Li2S. The solution of this problem relies on comprehensive understanding of Li2S2 conversion mechanisms. Herein, a theoretical model is established by generalizing the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) approach. More specifically, Li2S2 conversion is redefined in elementary steps that includes the participation of each electron. Associative and dissociative reaction mechanisms with electrocatalysts are proposed and inspected by the free energy criterion. Single atom catalysts containing Fe, Co, Ni, and V are discussed separately. The effects of applied electrode potential are accurately described by the generalized CHE approach. It is predicted that associative reaction mechanism can provide the highest electrode potential with the existence of Fe single atom catalysts. Analysis on electronic structures further confirms the electrocatalysis activity originates from the chemical bonds between S and transition metal atoms. This work unveils the Li2S2 conversion mechanisms in elementary steps. More importantly, the generalized CHE approach opens a new frontier of exploration on redox reactions in Li–S battery and hopefully other energy storage systems.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.02.002
Ultrahigh Pt-Mass-Activity Hydrogen Evolution Catalyst Electrodeposited from Bulk Pt,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Maximizing the Pt utilization is important for the widescale implementation of Pt-based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts, owing to the scarcity of Pt. Here, three-component heterostructured HER catalysts with ultrahigh Pt mass activity in which hollow PtCu alloy nanospheres are supported on an array of WO3 on Cu foam, are reported. It has been pointed out that the use of Pt counter electrode in a three-electrode configuration in evaluating catalysts’ HER performances in acidic media carries the risk of contaminating the working electrode in previous reports. Here, the authors rationally utilize this “contaminating” to “activate” low-HER-activity materials, maximizing the Pt utilization. As a result, ultrahigh Pt mass activity is achieved, that is 1.35 and 10.86 A mg−1Pt at overpotentials of 20 and 100 mV, respectively, 27 and 13 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C catalysts, outperforming some state-of-the-art Pt-single-atom catalysts. The hollow sphere structure and PtCu alloying increase the number and reactivity of active sites. Density function calculations and electrochemical experiments reveal that the synergy between WO3 and Pt is also responsible for the high HER activity where the hydrogen spillover effect triggers the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism and promotes the rapid removal of H* from Pt to re-expose the active sites.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202112207
Boron-Tethering and Regulative Electronic States Around Iridium Species for Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The performance of single-atom electrocatalysts usually suffers from attenuation due to high energy states, especially in harsh environments. Therefore, as high-efficiency electrocatalysts for hydrogen reduction reaction (HER), supported metal nanoclusters (NCs) with maximum metal atom efficiency are promising, yet the genuine mechanism involving rational orbital modulation is still arguable. Herein, the conjugating effect between electron-donor boron (B)-tethering engineering and iridium (Ir) that facilitates the electron capture of Ir atoms is explored, achieving highly dispersive Ir-NCs confined in N, B co-doped defective carbon (Ir@NBD-C). The Ir@NBD-C catalyst achieves displays remarkable high activity for HER in a pH-universal range, in particular, with an ultralow overpotential of 7 mV (10 mA cm−2), high mass activity of 652.2 A (Formula presented.), and turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.90 H2 S−1 (100 mV) in 1.0 m KOH, outperforming almost all state-of-the-art HER electrocatalysts. Operando characterizations and theoretical calculations unveil that the outstanding catalytic activity can attribute to the optimal binding to hydrogen intermediate species (H*) derived from the tunable and favorable electronic structure of the Ir site through the tethering of B heteroatoms. Undoubtedly, this work brings new insight into the design of catalysts with high intrinsic activity and thermodynamic stability.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202113191
Single-atom catalysts based on two-dimensional metalloporphyrin monolayers for ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.We systematically investigated the catalytic performance of 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals anchored onto two-dimensional extended porphyrin (PP) substrates as nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) electrocatalysts, employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and four-step high-throughput screening. Four novel metalloporphyrin (MPP, M = Zr, Nb, Hf, and Re) single-atom catalyst candidates have been identified due to their excellent catalytic performance (low onset potential, high stability, and selectivity). Through comprehensive reaction path search, the maximum Gibbs free energy changes for NRR on the ZrPP (enzymatic-consecutive hybrid path), NbPP (consecutive path), HfPP (enzymatic-consecutive hybrid path), and RePP (distal path) catalysts are 0.38, 0.41, 0.53, and 0.53 eV, respectively. Band structures, projected density of states, and charge/spin distributions show that the high catalytic activity is due to significant orbital hybridizations and charge transfer between N2 and MPP catalysts. We hope our work will promote experimental synthesis of these NRR electrocatalysts and provide new opportunities to the electrochemical conversion of N2 to NH3 under ambient conditions.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research,10.1007/s12274-021-4009-4
Mesoporous carbon promoting the efficiency and stability of single atomic electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSingle-atom Fe–N–C electrocatalysts are attracting more attentions as one most promising transition metal based single-atom catalyst towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the inaccessibility of internal Fe-Nx active sites and insufficient stability hinder their large-scale application. Herein, a facile benzoate-assisted self-template strategy which could dramatically enhance the oxygen reduction reaction catalytic performance and stability of ZIF-8 derived atomically dispersed Fe–N–C catalysts (Fe-SA/Meso-C) is developed. The sodium benzoate used in the present work is effective for promoting the formation of Fe–N–C catalysts with denser accessible active sites as well as mesopores with diameters ranging from 2.5 to 5 nm. These structural advantages make the synthesized Fe-SA/Meso-C catalysts afford excellent electrocatalytic performance for the ORR in 0.1 M KOH with a positive half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.926 V vs. RHE and exceptionally high kinetic current density (Jk) of 92.5 mA cm−2 at 0.85 V. Beyond that, Fe-SA/Meso-C shows outstanding long-term stability with over 90% activity retain after 90 h chronoamperometry i-t test as well as superior tolerance to methanol crossover. More importantly, the assembled zinc-air battery with Fe-SA/Meso-C as the cathode material achieves a high peak power density of 166.2 mW cm−2 and a high specific capacity of 776.1 mA h g−1. Our results reveal that small mesopores in atomically dispersed Fe–N–C electrocatalysts could facilitate mass transport, increase the accessibility of active sites and optimize the interface between electrolyte and carbon matrix, thus optimizing their electrocatalytic performance for the ORR. This work paves a way to the design and synthesis of stable single-atom electrocatalysts with optimized structure, electrochemical performance and promising applications.",Carbon,10.1016/j.carbon.2022.01.057
Atomically dispersed Ni anchored on polymer-derived mesh-like N-doped carbon nanofibers as an efficient CO2 electrocatalytic reduction catalyst,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Efficient electroreduction of CO2 into CO and other chemicals turns greenhouse gases into fuels and value-added chemicals, holding great promise for a closed carbon cycle and the alleviation of climate changes. However, there are still challenges in the large-scale application of CO2 electroreduction due to the sluggish kinetics. Herein we develop a self-assembly strategy to synthesize a highly efficient CO2 reduction electrocatalyst with atomically dispersed Ni-N4 active centers anchored on polymer-derived mesh-like N-doped carbon nanofibers (Ni-N4/NC). The Ni-N4/NC exhibits high selectivity for CO2 reduction reaction with CO Faradaic efficiency (CO FE) above 90% over a wide potential range from −0.6 to −1.0 V vs. RHE. The catalyst reaches a maximum CO FE up to 98.4% at −0.8 V with a TOF of 1.28 × 105 h−1 and Tafel slope of 113 mV·dec−1. The catalyst also exhibits remarkable stability, with little change in current density and CO FE over a 10-hour durability test at −0.8 V vs. RHE. This method provides a new route for the synthesis of highly efficient CO2 reduction electrocatalyst. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano Research,10.1007/s12274-022-4076-1
Ultrafine VN nanodots induced generation of abundant cobalt single-atom active sites on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube for efficient hydrogen evolution,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesDevelopment of highly active and stable non-noble electrocatalysts with well-defined nanostructures is crucial for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a novel three-dimensional (3D) self-supported electrode consists of vanadium nitride (VN) nanodots and Co nanoparticles co-embedded and highly active single Co atoms anchored in N-doped carbon nanotubes supported on carbon cloth (VN-Co@CoSAs-NCNTs/CC) is fabricated via a one-step in situ nanoconfined pyrolysis strategy, which shows remarkable enhanced HER electrocatalytic activity in acidic medium. During pyrolysis, the formed VN nanodots induce the generation of atomic CoNx sites in NCNTs, contributing to superior electrocatalytic activity. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results reveal that the electrode has multiple accessible active sites, fast reaction kinetics, low charge/mass transfer resistances, high conductivity, as well as downshifted d-band center with a thermodynamically favorable hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*), all of which greatly boost the HER performance. As a result, the VN-Co@CoSAs-NCNTs/CC electrode displays superb catalytic performance toward HER with a low overpotential of 29 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in acidic medium, which could maintain for at least 60 h of stable performance. This work opens a facile avenue to explore low-cost, high performance, but inexpensive metals/nitrogen-doped carbon composite electrocatalysts for HER.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.11.035
The ORR electron transfer kinetics control via Co-Nx and graphitic N sites in cobalt single atom catalysts in alkaline and acidic media,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesCost-effective 3d transition metal (TM) based single atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are potential alternatives for Pt-based electrocatalysts in fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Understanding the effects of SACs’ properties and active site composition on the catalytic performance is significant to construct highly efficient catalysts. Here, we successfully promote the activity of cobalt single atoms decorated on N-doped carbon nanosheets via tuning the content of different nitrogen components, which outperforms most reported cobalt SACs. The activity and kinetics show positive correlation trends with the content of Co-Nx and graphitic N, serving as the main active sites. Furthermore, ORR kinetics in alkaline media can be positively affected by the conductivity of catalysts while no similar relation is observed in acidic media. The slight loss of Co-Nx sites engenders a mild change of performance in alkaline media, while the decrease of Co-Nx site activity due to chemical oxidation of carbon support and the loss of Co-Nx sites in acidic media exacerbate the degradation of performance. Our work provides an insight into the relation between ORR electron transfer kinetics and active sites in 3d TM based SACs.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.10.027
3.4% Solar-to-Ammonia Efficiency from Nitrate Using Fe Single Atomic Catalyst Supported on MoS2 Nanosheets,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Electrochemical synthesis of NH3 is a carbon-free alternative to the traditional Haber–Bosch process. Obtaining NH3 from environmental pollutants, such as nitrates or nitrites, is a more practical route than from the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) due to the difficult cleavage of the inert triple bond of nitrogen gas. Here, a novel heterogeneous catalyst is reported based on iron (Fe) single-atoms supported on 2D MoS2 (Fe-MoS2) for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). Fe-MoS2 exhibits remarkable performance with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 98% for NO3RR to NH3 at an onset potential of −0.48 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as confirmed by the isotopic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced selectivity for the production of NH3 from single Fe atoms supported on MoS2 is attributed to a reduced energy barrier of 0.38 eV associated with de-oxidation of *NO to *N. The catalysts are coupled to an InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cell to demonstrate a solar-to-ammonia (STA) conversion efficiency of 3.4% and a yield rate of 510 µg h−1 cm−2. The results open new avenues for the design of single-atom catalysts (SAC) for the realization of solar-driven ammonia production.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202108316
Reducing the high hydrogen binding strength of vanadium carbide MXene with atomic Pt confinement for high activity toward HER,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.To construct an efficient electrocatalyst for HER, the high binding energy of MXene must be mitigated through electronic modulation of active sites. Here, we propose atomic Pt substitution in V2CTx MXene to modulate the electronic structure and promote catalytic activity toward HER. Pt–V2CTx exhibits high HER performance with a low overpotential of 27 mV at −10 mA cm−2 in acidic media, comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations indicate that the Pt atoms are efficiently confined to the V vacancy sites of V2CTx, accompanied by a unique electronic structure. The atomic substitution of Pt with higher occupied d states at the Fermi energy of Pt and surface oxygen sites can significantly indicate an optimum hydrogen-binding free energy (∆GH*), promoting HER performance.

Nickel single-atom catalysts intrinsically promoted by fast pyrolysis for selective electroreduction of CO2 into CO,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The electrochemical reduction reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) is an effective way towards carbon neutralization. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are expected to be efficient for CO2RR due to maximum atom utilization and excellent catalytic performance. Here, nitrogen-doped carbon supported Ni SACs (Ni-SAC@NCs) were prepared through effective fast pyrolysis. CO2 can convert into CO efficiently with Ni-SAC@NCs as electrocatalysts for CO2RR. The faradaic efficiency kept well above 80% in the applied potential window of −0.6 to −0.9 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), with a highest FECO of 95% at −0.6 V (vs. RHE). Ni-SAC@NCs can achieve the best CO selectivity under a small overpotential, surpassing most other state-of-the-art catalysts. Computations also indicate that the unique defect-Ni-N3 structure is the active site. This work not only provides a simple and promising new route for the preparation of SACs, but also proves the key role of the coordination environment in electrocatalysis.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120997

Herein, we report a single-atom Co-N-C catalyst (CoN4-CB) with a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO, 98.7%) in ECR comparable to that of a similarly prepared NiN4-CB catalyst. Impressively, CoN4-CB demonstrates a CO turnover frequency of 27173 h−1 and a CO current density of −33.6 mA∙cm−2 at −0.76 V, 20.2 and 6.8 times higher than that of NiN4-CB, respectively. In a solar-driven ECR system composed of a Si solar cell and a flow cell, CoN4-CB shows a remarkably large current density of 98.3 mA∙cm−2 with an average FECO of 92.1%. Theoretical calculations suggest that the energy barrier for *COOH formation largely decreases on CoN4 sites compared with NiN4 sites, leading to a low onset potential and high activity for CO production. This work will boost the development of efficient M-N-C electrocatalysts and further practical application of solar-driven ECR system.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120958
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction on dual-metal- and nitrogen-doped graphene: coordination environment effect of active sites,"© 2022 The Author(s).Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising method to convert CO2 to CO, and developing CO2RR electrocatalysts is essential to improve the conversion efficiency. Herein, the CO2RR catalytic performance of dual-metal-nitrogen-carbon catalysts (M1/M2-N6-Gra, Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3) with different bimetals and different coordination environments at active sites (the coordination number of metal and nitrogen ranges from 2 to 4) has been systematically studied through density functional theory (DFT). The calculated formation energies indicate that high-coordinated catalysts are thermodynamically stable. By calculating the Gibbs free energy changes of the CO2RR pathway and the selectivity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), we determine that the coordination environment of the active sites of the catalysts strongly affects the activity and selectivity of CO2 reduction to CO. The low-coordinated catalysts have strong *COOH and *CO adsorption capacity, and it is difficult for CO to desorb from the catalyst surface, resulting in the poor catalytic activity of CO2RR; the high-coordinated catalysts have moderate *COOH and *CO adsorption capacity, and have excellent catalytic activity for reducing CO2 to CO. In addition, the CO2RR reduction activity of most heteronuclear M1/M2-N6-Gra has been enhanced due to the synergy between heterometallic metals, and the synergy is effectively improved with the increase of the coordination number. In particular, using the limiting potential difference of CO2RR and HER as the selective descriptor, we have screened out four catalysts, including Co/Zn, Fe/Zn, Mn/Zn, and Fe/Mn-N6-Gra-Model 3 (the coordination number of metal and nitrogen is 4), which have favorable limiting potentials of −0.20, −0.24, −0.26, and −0.26 V, respectively. This work provides guidance for the development of effective bimetallic single-atom catalysts based on nitrogen-doped carbon materials for CO2RR.",Materials Advances,10.1039/d2ma00192f
Single-Atom Metal Anchored Zr6-Cluster-Porphyrin Framework Hollow Nanocapsules with Ultrahigh Active-Center Density for Electrocatalytic CO2Reduction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Designing earth-abundant electrocatalysts toward highly efficient CO2reduction has significant importance to decrease the global emission of greenhouse gas. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to anchor non-noble metal single atoms on Zr6-cluster-porphyrin framework hollow nanocapsules with well-defined and abundant metal-N4porphyrin sites for efficient electrochemical CO2reduction. Among different transition metal single atoms (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu), Co single-atom anchored Zr6-cluster-porphyrin framework hollow nanocapsules demonstrated the highest activity and selectivity for CO production. The rich Co-N4active centers and hierarchical porous structure contribute to enhanced CO2adsorption capability and moderate binding strength of reaction intermediates, thus facilitating *CO desorption and CO2-to-CO conversion. The Co-anchored nanocapsules maintain high efficiency and well-preserved stability during long-term electrocatalysis tests. Moreover, the Co-anchored nanocapsules exhibit a remarkable solar-to-CO energy conversion efficiency of 12.5% in an integrated solar-driven CO2reduction/O2evolution electrolysis system when powered by a custom large-area [Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95]Pb0.9(I0.85Br0.15)3-based perovskite solar cell.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c00547
Electroreduction of CO2and Quantification in New Transition-Metal-Based Deep Eutectic Solvents Using Single-Atom Ag Electrocatalyst,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are efficient media for CO2capture, and an electroreduction process using the deterministic surface of single-atom electrocatalysts is a facile way to screen gas absorption capacities of novel DESs. Using newly prepared transition-metal-based DESs indexed as TDESs, the interfacial mechanism, detection, quantification, and coordination modes of CO2were determined for the first time. The CO2has a minimum detection time of 300 s, whereas 500 s of continous ambient CO2saturation provided ZnCl2/ethanolamine (EA) (1:4) and CoCl2/EA (1:4) TDESs with a maximum CO2absorption capacity of 0.2259 and 0.1440 mmol/L, respectively. The results indicated that CO2coordination modes of η1(C) and η2(O, O) with Zn in ZnCl2/EA (1:4) TDESs are conceivable. We found that the transition metals in TDESs form an interface at the compact layer of the electrocatalyst, while CO2•-/CO2reside in the diffuse layer. These findings are important because they provide reliable inferences about interfacial phenomena for facile screening of CO2capture capacity of DESs or other green solvents.",ACS Omega,10.1021/acsomega.2c00672
Gadolinium Changes the Local Electron Densities of Nickel 3d Orbitals for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Generally, in terms of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, single-atom catalysts show high selectivities yet low current densities whereas conventional nanoparticle catalysts exhibit relatively high current densities but low selectivities. This work combines the advantages of the two classes of catalysts by constructing a Ni-Gd-N-doped carbon black electrocatalyst within which NiI active sites are exposed outside the carbon layers and Ni nanoparticles are encapsulated inside the carbon layers. The Gd atoms can not only influence the local electron densities of Ni 3d orbitals, thus strengthening the electronic activity, but also tailor the sizes of the Ni nanoparticles, thereby minimizing the activity toward hydrogen evolution. Accordingly, this electrocatalyst yields both a high CO faradaic efficiency (97 %) and a large current density (308 mA cm−2), alongside an outstanding stability (100 h).",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202201166
Square-pyramidal Fe-N4 with defect-modulated O-coordination: Two-tier electronic structure fine-tuning for enhanced oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Adjusting the electronic and geometric structures of the Fe-N4 active site using axially coordinated ligands has been shown to be effective for improving the performance of the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Any progress beyond that remains extremely challenging, however. Here, we demonstrate a two-tier electronic modulation strategy using defect-modulated O-coordination to further optimize the electronic structure of the Fe center in iron phthalocyanine (FePc), which realizes greatly enhanced ORR performances. Such an atomically dispersed FePc–O–defect catalyst is achieved using a wet ball-milling process. The mechanochemically constructed active site is a square-pyramidal Fe-N4, with the Fe atom located out of the N4-plane toward an axially coordinated O that is singly bonded to graphene at vacancy defects. The FePc–O–defect catalyst delivers a half-wave potential of 0.929 V with mass specific activity of 76.2 A g−1catalyst at 0.9 V in alkaline media. These values are the highest among the reported non-precious metal electrocatalysts and exceed the baseline with bare O-coordination.",Chem Catalysis,10.1016/j.checat.2022.01.025
Different Bonding Defects on Dual-Metal Single-Atom Electrocatalyst CoZnN6(OH) for Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Since dual-metal single-atom catalyst (CoZnN/C) has been experimentally synthesized by atomically arching CoZn on N-doped carbon nanofibers and exhibited potential electrocatalysis activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), we perform first-principles calculations to identify the highly active sites at different defects by comparing the four-step ORR processes on the constructed four CoZnN6 models on graphene. The corresponding N-edge effect, dopant effect, and C-edge ring-closing effect are evaluated with the ORR evolution on different bonding environments, including pristine CoZnN6(OH), nanoribbon (NR) along zigzag direction, substitution of carbon/oxygen (C/O substitution), and C-edge ring-closing configurations. OH-ligand is shown to significantly improve the ORR activities for all the considered structures. Especially, C-substituted CoZnN6(OH), NR-CoZnN5O(OH) and CoZnN6(OH) with C-edge-effect exhibit obviously reduced overpotentials (ηlim=0.28, 0.48 and 0.41 V) of rate-determining steps among all the considered nine candidates. By plotting the relationship between the limiting potentials (Ulim) and free energies of intermediate *OH (ΔGOH*), two prior catalysts of pristine-CoZnN5C(OH) and defect-CoZnN6CH(OH) are located near the top of the volcano curve with higher Ulim=0.95 and 0.82 V than Pt(111) (Ulim=0.80 V), implying that C-substitution could facilitate ORR performance in pristine- and defect-CoZnN6(OH) bonding situation.",ChemPhysChem,10.1002/cphc.202100902
Surface pourbaix plots of M@N4-graphene single-atom electrocatalysts from density functional theory thermodynamic modeling,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) are rapidly developing in various application areas, including electrocatalysis of different reactions, usually taking place under harsh pH/electrode potential conditions. Thus, a full atomic-level understanding of the nature of the active sites under realistic electrochemical conditions is needed, having in mind that the state of SACs active centers could be altered by the adsorption of spectating species. In this contribution, Density Functional Theory is employed to conduct thermodynamic analysis of SACs with metal atoms (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, or Au) embedded into N4 moiety in graphene. Various surface electrochemical processes on such SACs are considered, their Pourbaix plots are constructed, and their activity, selectivity, and stability under operating conditions are discussed. It is demonstrated how adsorption of H, O and OH can cause blockage and restructuring of the active sites and alter the electronic structure. Furthermore, when one deals with metals with lower D-band filling, it is shown that metal center oxidation is preferred over the oxidation of carbon lattice. The effect of the state of the metal center on the reactivity of the carbon lattice is discussed in the case of Fe@N4-graphene. Finally, a possible strategy for confirming the changes in the architecture of the SACs’ active site by analyzing their vibration spectra is suggested.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140155

The construction of high-efficiency and durable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in a wide pH range and seawater is critical to overcoming the sluggish kinetic process. Herein, we develop an efficient catalytic material composed of a single-atom Ru-N4site and Ru nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon (Ru1+NPs/N-C) through the coordination-pyrolysis strategy of the melamine formaldehyde resin.

Moreover, Ru1+NPs/N-C shows comparable hydrogen production performance and a higher faradic efficiency to 20% Pt/C in natural seawater and artificial simulated seawater. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the strong synergistic effects between the Ru-N4site and Ru nanoparticles modify the electronic structure to accelerate the HER kinetics.

Systematic experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate the vital role of electronic synergy between RuAC and Ru–N4 in improving the electrocatalytic activity toward the CO2 evolution reaction (CO2ER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The electronic properties of the Ru–N4 sites are essentially modulated by the adjacent RuAC species, which optimizes the interactions with key reaction intermediates thereby reducing the energy barriers in the rate-determining steps of the CO2RR and CO2ER. Remarkably, the RuAC+SA@NCB-based cell displays unprecedented overpotentials as low as 1.65 and 1.86 V at ultrahigh rates of 1 and 2 A g−1, and twofold cycling lifespan than the baselines. The findings provide a novel strategy to construct catalysts with composite active sites comprising multiple atom assemblies for high-performance metal–CO2 batteries.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202200559
Boosting Oxygen Reduction for High-Efficiency H2O2 Electrosynthesis on Oxygen-Coordinated Co-N-C Catalysts,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Atomically dispersed Co-N-C is a promising material for H2O2 selective electrosynthesis via a two-electron oxygen reduction reaction. However, the performance of typical Co-N-C materials with routine Co-N4 active center is insufficient and needs to be improved further. This can be done by fine-tuning its atomic coordination configuration. Here, a single-atom electrocatalyst (Co/NC) is reported that comprises a specifically penta-coordinated Co-N-C configuration (O-Co-N2C2) with Co center coordinated by two nitrogen atoms, two carbon atoms, and one oxygen atom. Using a combination of theoretical predictions and experiments, it is confirmed that the unique atomic structure slightly increases the charge state of the cobalt center. This optimizes the adsorption energy towards *OOH intermediate, and therefore favors the two-electron ORR relevant for H2O2 electrosynthesis. In neutral solution, the as-synthesized Co/NC exhibits a selectivity of over 90% over a potential ranging from 0.36 to 0.8 V, with a turnover frequency value of 11.48 s−1; thus outperforming the state-of-the-art carbon-based catalysts.",Small,10.1002/smll.202200730
Screening of single-atom catalysts sandwiched by boron nitride sheet and graphene for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSingle-atom catalysts possess high chemical activity, but their single-atom active sites are not only directly attacked by the reaction intermediates but also easily drifted from the support. In this work, a series of single-atom catalysts sandwiched by boron nitride sheet and graphene (BN/TM/G) are screened for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) theoretically. The scaling relationships indicate that ΔG∗OH can serve as the descriptor to reflect the catalytic activity of BN/TM/G. Moreover, the volcano plot suggests that BN/TM/G with moderate binding strength of ∗OH (0.5 eV < ΔG∗OH < 1.2 eV) show relatively high ORR and OER activity. When the metals are Co, Mo, Ru, Tc, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Fe, the corresponding BN/TM/G catalysts are screened out for efficiently catalyzing ORR and OER. Especially, BN/Cu/G has the highest ORR activity with overpotential of 0.39 V, which may be attributed to the moderate interaction between Cu atom and BN sheet/graphene. The BN/Mo/G has the highest OER activity with overpotential of 0.52 V. In addition, BN/Cu/G and BN/Mo/G have excellent poisoning-tolerance ability for H2S, SO2, and CO. This work is conducive to provide guidance for designing this kind of sandwich-like electrocatalysts for ORR and OER.",Renewable Energy,10.1016/j.renene.2022.03.003
Highly Active and Durable Single-Atom Tungsten-Doped NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanosheet @ NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanorod Heterostructures for Water Splitting,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Developing robust and highly active non-precious electrocatalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) is crucial for the industrialization of hydrogen energy. In this study, a highly active and durable single-atom W-doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheet @ NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorod heterostructure (W-NiS0.5Se0.5) electrocatalyst is prepared. W-NiS0.5Se0.5 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the HER and OER with ultralow overpotentials (39 and 106 mV for the HER and 171 and 239 mV for the OER at 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively) and excellent long-term durability (500 h), outperforming commercial precious-metal catalysts and many other previously reported transition-metal-based compounds (TMCs). The introduction of single-atom W delocalizes the spin state of Ni, which results in an increase in the Ni d-electron density. This causes the optimization of the adsorption/desorption process of H and a significant reduction in the adsorption free energy of the rate-determining step (O* → OOH*), thus accelerating the thermodynamics and kinetics of the HER and OER. This work provides a rational feasible strategy to design single-atom catalysts for water splitting and to develop advanced TMC electrocatalysts by regulating delocalized spin states.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202107053
Direct Synthesis of Stable 1T-MoS2 Doped with Ni Single Atoms for Water Splitting in Alkaline Media,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Metallic MoS2 (i.e., 1T-MoS2) is considered as the most promising precious-metal-free electrocatalyst with outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in acidic media comparable to Pt. However, sluggish kinematics of HER in alkaline media and its inability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hamper its development as bifunctional catalysts. The instability of 1T-MoS2 further impedes its applications for scaling up, calling an urgent need for simple synthesis to produce stable 1T-MoS2. In this work, the challenge of 1T-MoS2 synthesis is first addressed using a direct one-step hydrothermal method by adopting ascorbic acid. 1T-MoS2 with flower-like morphology is obtained, and transition metals (Ni, Co, Fe) are simultaneously doped into 1T-MoS2. Ni-1T-MoS2 achieves an enhanced bifunctional catalytic activity for both HER and OER in alkaline media, where the key role of Ni doping as single atom is proved to be essential for boosting HER/OER activity. Finally, a Ni-1T-MoS2||Ni-1T-MoS2 electrolyzer is fabricated, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an applied cell voltage of only 1.54 V for overall water splitting.",Small,10.1002/smll.202107238
Atomic Molybdenum for Synthesis of Ammonia with 50% Faradic Efficiency,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The electrochemical dinitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has gained significant interest as an environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional Haber–Bosch process for the synthesis of ammonia (NH3). However, up to now, most of the reported NRR electrocatalysts with satisfactory catalytic activities have been hindered by the large overpotential in N2 activation. The preparation of highly efficient Mo-based NRR electrocatalyst in acidic electrolytes under ambient conditions is demonstrated here, consisting of stabilized single Mo atoms anchored on holey nitrogen-doped graphene synthesized through a convenient potassium-salt-assisted activation method. At −0.05 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), an electrode consisting of the resultant electrocatalyst immobilized on carbon fiber paper can attain an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 50.2% and a NH3 yield rate of 3.6 µg h−1 mgcat−1 with low overpotentials. Density functional theory calculations further unveil that compared to the original graphene without holes, the edge coordinated Mo atoms and the existence of vacancies on holey graphene lower the overpotential of N2 reduction, thereby promoting the NRR catalytic activity. This work could provide new guidelines for future designs in single-atom catalysis that would be beneficial to ambient N2 fixation, and replacement of classical synthesis processes that are very energy-intensive.",Small,10.1002/smll.202106327
Catalytic Kinetics Regulation for Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrogen Oxidation by Ru-Nanoclusters-Coupled Mn3O4 Catalysts Decorated with Atomically Dispersed Ru Atoms,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Electrochemical N2 oxidation reaction (NOR), using water and N2 in the atmosphere, represents a sustainable approach for nitric production to replace the conventional industrial synthesis with high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. Meanwhile, owing to chemical inertness of N2 and sluggish kinetics for 10-electron transfer, emerging electrocatalysts remain largely underexplored. Herein, Ru-nanoclusters-coupled Mn3O4 catalysts decorated with atomically dispersed Ru atoms (Ru–Mn3O4) are designed and explored as an advanced electrocatalyst for ambient N2 oxidation, with an excellent Faraday efficiency (28.87%) and a remarkable NO3- yield (35.34 µg h-1 mg-1cat.), respectively. Experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the outstanding activity is ascribed to the coexistence of Ru clusters and single-atom Ru. The synergistic effect between the Ru clusters and Mn3O4 can effectively activate the chemically inert N2, lowering the kinetic barrier for the vital breakage of N≡N. The intensive *OH supply and enhanced conductivity are used to regulate the catalytic kinetics for optimized performance. This work provides brand-new ideas for the rational design of electrocatalysts in complicated electrocatalytic reactions with multiple dynamics-different steps.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202108180
Single transition metal atom anchored on VSe2 as electrocatalyst for nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2021There has been an increasing interest in converting nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) via electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). In this study, the NRR catalytic performance of a series of single transition metal (TM) atoms anchored on two dimensional VSe2 (TM-VSe2) was studied via performing the first-principles calculations. Among the investigated single-atom catalyst of TM-VSe2, W-VSe2 demonstrates the best NRR catalytic performance with a limiting potential of −0.36 V and effective inhibition of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, our calculations demonstrate that W-VSe2 is highly stable as single-atom anchored on the surface of VSe2 monolayer, whose improved electrical conductivity ensures the electron transform during NRR process. Moreover, we found that the limiting potential of NRR on TM-VSe2 was negatively correlated with the adsorption energy of reaction intermediate *N-NH, and related with the total magnetic moment of TM-VSe2. Importantly, we identified the origin of the NRR catalytic activity from electronic aspect. Our results provide a new way for measuring the NRR catalytic activity of single-atom catalysts.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.152272
Designing superior bifunctional electrocatalyst with high-purity pyrrole-type CoN4 and adjacent metallic cobalt sites for rechargeable Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing cost-effective and high-efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for rechargeable Zn-air battery application. However, achieving high-active dual sites for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis in a single catalyst, as well as determining the decisive active sites for OER and ORR to explore the synergistically catalytic mechanism remain challenges. Herein, we propose a catalyst consisting of high-purity pyrrole nitrogen anchored cobalt single-atom (CoN4) and adjacent metallic cobalt sites (Cop@CoNC) for explicit research of dominated active sites. The obtained Cop@CoNC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity with a small overpotential difference of 0.68 V between OER potential at 10 mA cm−2 and ORR half-wave potential, outperforming commercial noble-metal based catalysts. Electrochemical measurements and theoretical simulations verify the pyrrole-type CoN4 and adjacent metallic cobalt are separately decisive active sites for ORR and OER activities. Simultaneously, metallic cobalt regulates electron distribution of CoN4 moiety to improve ORR activity. Importantly, the rechargeable liquid and flexible solid-state Zn-air batteries using Cop@CoNC as air electrode catalysts possess high peak power densities of 188.8 and 121.8 mW cm−2, respectively. Our findings provide a feasible strategy to design high-performance multifunctional catalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries application.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.01.040
Coordinatively Deficient Single-atom Fe-N-C Electrocatalyst with Optimized Electronic Structure for High-performance Lithium-sulfur Batteries,"© 2021The rationally-designed single-atom catalyst that promotes efficient sulfur electrochemistry is highly desired yet still challenging for the development of high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, the deficient coordination of single-atom Fe site is firstly and theoretically predicted to endorse higher sulfur affinity and catalytic activity, due to the stronger hybridization between Fe 3dzz and S 3py orbitals compared with that in common FeN4 scenario. The following validation is conducted to prepare the monodispersed Fe single atoms with tuned coordination number on nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as FeN2-NC and FeN4-NC) via the ligand control on the Fe precursor. As expected, the undercoordinated FeN2-NC fulfills significantly stronger sulfur immobilization and catalyzation as confirmed by a series of physicochemical and electrochemical evaluations. As a result, sulfur electrodes hosted by FeN2-NC realize excellent cyclability and rate capability, and particularly, a highly reversible areal capacity up to 4.5 mAh cm−2 under a high areal sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm−2 and a low electrolyte to sulfur ratio of 5.3 mL g−1. This work highlights the great feasibility and validity of coordinative defect engineering in single-atom catalysts for improving the Li-S battery electrochemistry, which could also enlighten advanced material designs in other related energy areas.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2021.12.040
Materials informatics-guided superior electrocatalyst: A case of pyrolysis-free single-atom coordinated with N-graphene nanomesh,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdIn this work, we apply materials informatics (MI) techniques for property prediction of nanoporous carbon-based electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is a key, but sluggish reaction in proton exchange membrane fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Nitrogen-doped graphene nanomesh (NGM) was identified as an appropriate ORR catalyst by the MI techniques, which is a useful support to producing designed nitrogen-coordinated single-atom catalysts via pyrolysis-free pathway. Herein, single-atom catalysts (FePc/NGM) with predictable structures were fabricated by anchoring iron phthalocyanine (FePc) on the MI-guided NGM. Compared with the randomly creating Fe-Nx moieties on a carbon matrix via pyrolysis, FePc were riveted onto NGM via axial interactions between Fe-N4 moieties in FePc and nitrogen in NGM graphene matrix. As a result, Fe-N5 with superior catalytic activity for ORR was created. The elaborately designed FePc/NGM possesses an outstanding electrocatalytic activity owing to its low-dimensional structure and the significant change in electronic and geometric structures arising from the rehybridization of Fe 3d orbitals from FePc with the nitrogen orbitals from NGM at the axial direction. This work demonstrates that fusion of experiments with material informatics is indispensable for the practice of the inorganic synthetic chemistry.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106868
Coordination-tuned Fe single-atom catalyst for efficient CO2 electroreduction: The power of B atom,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Designing of effective electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction into value-added chemicals is the key to reducing CO2 concentration and achieving carbon neutrality. However, achieving high activity and product selectivity simultaneously remains a significant challenge. Herein, a series of Fe single-atom catalysts coordinated by B atoms, namely FeBxCy (x + y = 3 or 4), are constructed to systematically investigate the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) based on density functional theory computations. Eight catalysts, including FeO4, are identified that can effectively activate CO2 molecules and significantly inhibit competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Among them, FeB2C and FeB2C2h (h represents a cis structure) show the higher CO2RR activity with the less negative limiting potentials of −0.24 and −0.40 V toward production of CH4, indicating the optimal content for doping B atoms. The activity mechanism shows that d-band center and magnetic moment of central Fe atom can be manipulated by rational modulating the coordinated B atoms to improve the CO2RR performance. By the coordinated B atom, an optimal adsorption strength of the reaction intermediates can be achieved on the FeBxCy surface, and thereby increasing CO2RR catalytic activity and product selectivity. FeB2C with more negative d-band center and the optimal Fe atomic magnetic moment shows the best CO2RR performance. These results reveal a great potential of coordination tuning for CO2RR, and provide a new theoretical perspective for rational design of high activity, selective CO2RR catalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.134270
High-Efficiency Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Oxygen Reduction Enabled by a Tungsten Single Atom Catalyst with Unique Terdentate N1O2 Coordination,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have shown great potential in the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, current studies are mainly focused on 3d transition-metal SACs, and very little attention has been paid to 5d SACs. Here, a new kind of W SAC anchored on a porous O, N-doped carbon nanosheet (W1/NO-C) is designed and prepared via a simple coordination polymer-pyrolysis method. A unique local structure of W SAC, terdentate W1N1O2 with the coordination of two O atoms and one N atom, is identified by the combination of aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. Remarkably, the as-prepared W1/NO-C catalyzes the ORR via a 2e– pathway with high onset potential, high H2O2 selectivity in the wide potential range, and excellent operation durability in 0.1 m KOH solution, superior to most of state-of-the-art H2O2 electrocatalysts ever reported. Theoretical calculations reveal that the C atoms adjacent to O in the W1N1O2-C moiety are the most active sites for the 2e– ORR to H2O2 with the optimal binding energy of the HOO* intermediate. This work opens up a new opportunity for the development of high-performance W-based catalysts for electrochemical H2O2 production.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202110224
Supercritical CO2 assisted synthesis of highly accessible iron single atoms and clusters on nitrogen-doped carbon as efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalysts,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Replacing Pt-based catalysts with metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) derived single-atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has largely been impeded by the hidden activity of SACs due to the challenges in exposing unactivated sites and regulating their electronic states. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of highly exposed iron single atoms and clusters on imidazole frameworks derived carbon (scCO2-FeC@FeNC) by supercritical CO2 (scCO2) assisted strategy. The scCO2 fluid not only incises dodecahedron into uniform cubes with tenth of thickness but also constructs hierarchical pores in frameworks without utilization of templates, and thus in favor to exposure of inactive sites. Moreover, theoretical simulations disclose that the adjacent cluster weakens hybridization between occupied d-orbitals of iron for Fe-N moiety and p-orbitals of adsorbed oxygen, thereby optimizing adsorption–desorption process of oxygenated intermediates and accelerating ORR kinetics. With these merits, scCO2-FeC@FeNC delivers an ORR activity with half-wave potential of 0.91 V in alkaline solution. The Zn-air battery using scCO2-FeC@FeNC as air cathode has a specific capacity of 784.1 mAh gZn−1 and long-time durability of 200 h, surpassing commercial Pt/C-based Zn-air battery. This work provides a promising approach to fabricate MOF-derived metal-N-C ORR electrocatalysts with high performance.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.134460
Elucidating the Critical Role of Ruthenium Single Atom Sites in Water Dissociation and Dehydrogenation Behaviors for Robust Hydrazine Oxidation-Boosted Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Hydrazine oxidation (HzOR)-assisted overall water splitting (OWS) provides a unique approach to energy-efficient hydrogen production (HER). However, there are still major challenges in the design of bifunctional catalysts and gain deep insight into the mechanism of both water dissociation and dehydrogenation kinetics triggered by the same active species during HzOR-assisted OWS. Here, ruthenium single atoms (Ru SAs) anchored onto sulphur-vacancies of tungsten disulphide (WS2) are prepared by a sulfidation and facile galvanostatic deposition strategy. The WS2/Ru SAs act as a bifunctional catalyst and outperforms commercial platinum (Pt) catalysts for both HzOR and HER. Ultralow potentials of −74 and −32.1 mV at 10 mA cm−2 are achieved for HzOR and HER, respectively. Two-electrode electrolyzer using WS2/Ru SAs as both anode and cathode reaches 10 mA cm−2 with cell voltage of only 15.4 mV, which is far below that of most electrocatalysts including commercial Pt. Density functional theory calculations unravel the critical role of Ru SAs in WS2, where the sluggish dissociation of water in HER can be promoted on Ru sites, and the sulfur sites of WS2 exhibit a more thermoneutral behavior for hydrogen intermediate adsorption. Moreover, Ru sites are also active centers for stepwise hydrazine dehydrogenation during HzOR.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202109439
Unveiling the Underlying Mechanism of Transition Metal Atoms Anchored Square Tetracyanoquinodimethane Monolayers as Electrocatalysts for N2 Fixation,"© 2021 Zhengzhou University.We for the first time systematically studied the structures and electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction properties of two-dimensional single transition-metal anchored square tetracyanoquinodimethane monolayers (labeled as: TM-sTCNQ, TM = 3d, 4d, 5d series transition metals) by employing density functional theory method. Through high-throughput screenings and full reaction path researches, two promising electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction catalysts Nb-sTCNQ and Mo-sTCNQ have been obtained. The nitrogen reduction reaction onset potential on Nb-sTCNQ is as low as −0.48 V. Furthermore, the Nb-sTCNQ catalyst can quickly desorb NH3 produced with a free energy of 0.65 eV, giving Nb-sTCNQ excellent catalytic cycle performance. The high catalytic activity of the two materials might be attributed to the effective charge transfer between the active center and adsorbed N2, which enables the active center to adsorb and activate inert N2 molecules well, and the reduction processes require small energy input (i.e., the maximum free energy changes are small). This work provides insights for finding highly efficient, stable, and low-cost nitrogen reduction reaction electrocatalysts. We hope our results can promote further experimental and theoretical research of this field.",Energy and Environmental Materials,10.1002/eem2.12277
"Pyrolysis-free, facile mechanochemical strategy toward cobalt single-atom/nitrogen-doped carbon for highly efficient water splitting","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Exploring new synthetic strategies for single-atom catalysts (SACs) is filled with promise for the production of SACs. Conventional pyrolysis of selected precursors for SACs requires well-controlled pyrolysis conditions, and currently, it is still a critical challenge to establish a versatile strategy for preparing well-defined SACs. Herein, we demonstrate a facile mechanochemical-induced self-sustaining reaction to fabricate Co SACs supported by nitrogen-doped carbon via direct milling of cobalt (II) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(4′-bromophenyl)porphyrin (Co-TPP-Br) with calcium carbide. The as-prepared ball-milling sample (BM) Co-BM-C can be directly obtained without the utilization of pre-prepared carbon support or further pyrolysis procedure. Furthermore, the obtained Co-BM-C shows both excellent performance for oxygen evolution (240 mV overpotential@10 mA cm−2) and hydrogen evolution (126 mV overpotential @10 mA cm−2) in 1 M KOH, exhibiting great potential as the water-splitting electrocatalyst (1.60 V@10 mA cm−2).

In Situ Electronic Redistribution Tuning of NiCo2S4 Nanosheets for Enhanced Electrocatalysis,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Metal Ru and vacancy engineering play an important role in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, there are few reports targeted on electrocatalysts by simultaneously employing these two strategies. Herein, theoretical calculation firstly predicts that Ru and VS can regulate the adsorption energy of OER/HER intermediates for NiCo2S4 electrocatalysts. Then, a facile solvothermal-photochemical strategy is utilized to synthesis series NiCo2S4 samples: through filling the solvothermal-created VS in NiCo2S4–x with Ru single atoms (Ru-NiCo2S4–x) under ultraviolet irradiation as OER catalysts. Besides, Ru nanoclusters are introduced into NiCo2S4 without VS (Ru-NiCo2S4) for HER. As a result, the OER exchange current density of NiCo2S4–x is prominently boosted after decoration of Ru single atom, which possesses an eminently low overpotential of 190 mV@50 mA cm−2, while Ru-NiCo2S4 shows superior HER performance (32 mV@10 mA cm−2) compared with Ru-NiCo2S4–x, surpassing most reported electrocatalytic materials. Moreover, Ru-NiCo2S4–x//Ru-NiCo2S4 exhibits remarkable stability and catalytic performance in the overall water splitting, with a cell voltage value of 1.46 V at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 m KOH. Bader charge analysis unravels the “restricted-delocalized-restricted” phenomenon between electrons promote the electron interactions, which in turn improves electrochemical performance.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202109731
Coordination environments tune the activity of oxygen catalysis on single atom catalysts: A computational study,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Designing highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) is extremely important for developing regenerative fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have gained considerable attention in recent years because of their maximum atom utilization efficiency and tunable coordination environments. Herein, through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically explored the ORR/OER performances of nitrogen-coordinated transition metal carbon materials (TM-Nx-C (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Pd, and Pt; x = 3, 4)) through tailoring the coordination environment. Our results demonstrate that compared to conventional tetra-coordinated (TM-N4-C) catalysts, the asymmetric tri-coordinated (TM-N3-C) catalysts exhibit stronger adsorption capacity of catalytic intermediates. Among them, Ni-N3-C possesses optimal adsorption energy and the lowest overpotential of 0.29 and 0.28 V for ORR and OER, respectively, making it a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for oxygen catalysis. Furthermore, we find this enhanced effect stems from the additional orbital interaction between newly uncoordinated d-orbitals and p-orbitals of oxygenated species, which is evidently testified via the change of d-band center and integral crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP). This work not only provides a potential bifunctional oxygen catalyst, but also enriches the knowledge of coordination engineering for tailoring the activity of SACs, which may pave the way to design and discover more promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen catalysis.

Engineering solid–liquid-gas interfaces of single-atom cobalt catalyst for enhancing the robust stability of neutral Zn-air batteries under high current density,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.To simultaneously achieve high power density and robust stability under high current density for neutral Zn-air batteries (ZABs), it is significant yet still remains challenging for the rational design of advanced air–cathode electrocatalyst with fast electron transfer, rapid oxygen/electrolyte transport and timely water removal. Herein, we synthesized the single Co atoms embedded in sandwich-like multimodally porous N-doped dual-carbon architecture (denoted as the NMCS-rGO-Co) via a facile self-assembly method and subsequent pyrolysis strategy. By taking advantage of abundant Co-N4 active sites and the optimized multimodally porous structure, the obtained NMCS-rGO-Co catalyst possesses stable three-phase reaction interfaces (catalysts, electrolyte and oxygen), which could be beneficial to simultaneously achieving fast electron transfer, accelerated oxygen/electrolyte diffusion and timely water removal. In response, the NMCS-rGO-Co catalyst displays excellent ORR performance in neutral electrolyte. More importantly, the NMCS-rGO-Co-based neutral ZABs exhibit the robust stability accompanied with continuously discharging for 36 h under high current density of 50 mA cm−2. This is the first time to rationally design efficient catalysts for achieving the long-term stability of neutral ZABs at high current density from the perspective of constructing stable three-phase interfaces. This work also sheds new lights on the development of neutral ORR catalysts for the application of sustainable energy conversion technologies.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.133685
Recent advances in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction for on-site hydrogen peroxide synthesis in acidic media,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesElectrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via two-electron pathway is a promising approach to decentralized and on-site hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production beyond the traditional anthraquinone process.

Porous β-FeOOH nanotube stabilizing Au single atom for high-efficiency nitrogen fixation,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is highly desirable to achieve sustainable ammonia (NH3) production via an alternative carbon free strategy. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with super high atomic utilization and catalytic efficiency exhibit great potential for NRR. Herein, a high-performance NRR SAC is facilely prepared via a simple deposition method to anchor Au single atoms onto porous β-FeOOH nanotubes. The resulting Au-SA/FeOOH can efficiently drive NRR under ambient conditions, and the NH3 yield reaches as high as 2,860 µg·h−1·mgAu−1 at −0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with 14.2% faradaic efficiency, much superior to those of all the reported Au-based electrocatalysts. Systematic investigations demonstrate that the synergy of much enhanced N2 adsorption, directional electron export, and mass transfer ability in Au-SA/FeOOH greatly contributes to the superior NRR activity.

Herein, we synthesize a highly dispersed N-doped carbon frames (NCFs) anchored with Co single atoms (SAs) and Co nanoparticles (NPs) catalyst by a doping-adsorption-pyrolysis strategy for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The Co SAs-Co NPs/NCFs catalyst exhibits an excellent HER activity with small overpotential, low Tafel slope, high turnover frequency as well as remarkable stability. It also exhibits a superior HER performance in the entire pH range. Combining with experimental and theoretical calculation, we find that Co SAs with Co-N3 coordination structure and Co NPs have a strong interaction for promoting synergistic HER electrocatalytic process. The H2O molecule is easily activated and dissociated on Co NPs, while the generated H* is easily adsorbed on Co SAs for HER, which makes the Co SAs-Co NPs/NCFs catalyst exhibit more suitable H adsorption strength and more conducive to the activation and dissociation of H2O molecules. This work not only proposes a novel idea for constructing coupling catalyst with atomic-level precision, but also provides strong reference for the development of high-efficiency HER electrocatalysts for practical application.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.09.037
Non-precious metal activated MoSi2N4 monolayers for high-performance OER and ORR electrocatalysts: A first-principles study,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Developing high-performance electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for energy conversion and storage. Recently, a new type of two-dimensional material MoSi2N4 was successfully synthesized and received considerable attention because of novel properties and potential applications. Herein, by means of first principles calculation, the OER/ORR activities of 3d transition metal (TM) atoms embedded MoSi2N4 (TM@MSN) were investigated. The calculated results indicate that TM atoms on MoSi2N4 exhibit good electrochemical stability. On TM sites, Ti@MSN shows the highest OER activity with an overpotential of 0.48 V, whereas Cr@MSN is the most active ORR catalyst with an overpotential of 0.48 V. The Si site (Si−N1−Cu) of Cu@MSN follows the dual-site mechanism, exhibiting the same OER/ORR overpotential as that of N site (0.55/0.65 V). Interestingly, the outer N site (Zn−N1) of Zn@MSN achieves the lowest OER overpotential of 0.38 V, better than that of the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. We demonstrate that 3d TM atoms not only serve as active sites themselves but also activate the host atoms to improve OER/ORR performance of MoSi2N4. Our work opens new windows of opportunity for developing novel catalysts beyond the precious metal-based electrocatalysts for efficient energy conversion and storage.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.152234
First-Principles Calculations on Semiconducting ϵ-GeS and ϵ-SnS Monolayer Nanosheets with Photocatalytic Activity for Sunlight-Driven Water Splitting,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The design of two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin nanosheets with favorable electronic and optic properties that can satisfy the essential requirements of photocatalytic water splitting remains a challenge. Anisotropic Janus 2D materials exhibit fascinating potential due to their excellent photocatalytic performance, yet the scarcity of such materials limits their wide application. Herein, an allotrope of GeS and SnS monolayers with a ϵ-phosphorene-like atomic arrangement (ϵ-GeS and ϵ-SnS monolayers) is predicted to be a promising electrocatalyst for photocatalytic water splitting by first-principles calculations, and the results attest to its good stabilities. Both Janus monolayers prove to be semiconducting with direct band gaps of 2.63 eV for ϵ-GeS and 2.41 eV for ϵ-SnS, straddling the redox potentials of water. HSE calculations reveal that both GeS and SnS allotropes display notable anisotropy along with high hole mobility (∼103cm2V-1s-1). Moreover, both monolayers present strong optical absorption in the visible-light excitation range (105cm-1), thus ensuring efficient harvesting for solar energy. Particularly, spontaneous hydrogen (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) half reactions can occur simultaneously, driven only by sunlight-induced carriers, which still work even under strain. More interestingly, after transition-metal atom (from Sc to Zn) decoration, Co/ϵ-GeS and Sc/ϵ-SnS are confirmed as the most efficient single-atom HER catalysts, capable of driving HER with low overpotentials of 0.02 and -0.05 V, respectively, even outperforming the commercial Pt catalyst (-0.09 V). Meanwhile, for OER, low-overpotential Ni/ϵ-SnS (0.42 V) proves to be better than the generally used IrO2catalyst (0.55 V).",ACS Applied Nano Materials,10.1021/acsanm.1c04495
Stabilizing Cobalt Single Atoms via Flexible Carbon Membranes as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Binder-Free Zinc-Air Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Single-atom catalysts with high activity and efficient atom utilization have great potential in the electrocatalysis field, especially for rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). However, it is still a serious challenge to rationally construct a single-atom catalyst with satisfactory electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability. Here, we simultaneously realize the atomic-level dispersion of cobalt and the construction of carbon nanotube (CNT)-linked N-doped porous carbon nanofibers (NCFs) via an electrospinning strategy. In this hierarchical structure, the Co-N4sites provide efficient oxygen reduction/evolution electrocatalytic activity, the porous architectures of NCFs guarantee the active site's accessibility, and the interior CNTs enhance the flexibility and mechanical strength of porous fibers. As a binder-free air cathode, the as-prepared catalysts deliver superdurability of 600 h at 10 mA cm-2for aqueous ZABs and considerable flexibility and a small voltage gap for all-solid-state ZABs. This work provides an effective single-atom design/nanoengineering for superdurable zinc-air batteries.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c00278
Highly Active and Selective Electroreduction of N2by the Catalysis of Ga Single Atoms Stabilized on Amorphous TiO2Nanofibers,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The electroreduction of N2 under ambient conditions has emerged as one of the most promising technologies in chemistry, since it is a greener way to make NH3 than the traditional Haber-Bosch process. However, it is greatly challenged with a low NH3 yield and faradaic efficiency (FE) because of the lack of highly active and selective catalysts. Inherently, transition (d-block) metals suffer from inferior selectivity due to fierce competition from H2 evolution, while post-transition (p-block) metals exhibit poor activity due to insufficient ""πback-donation""behavior. Considering their distinct yet complementary electronic structures, here we propose a strategy to tackle the activity and selectivity challenge through the atomic dispersion of p-block metal on an all-amorphous transition-metal matrix. To address the activity issue, lotus-root-like amorphous TiO2 nanofibers are synthesized which, different from vacancy-engineered TiO2 nanocrystals reported previously, possess abundant intrinsic oxygen vacancies (VO) together with under-coordinated dangling bonds in nature, resulting in significantly enhanced N2 activation and electron transport capacity. To address the selectivity issue, well-isolated single atoms (SAs) of Ga are successfully synthesized through the confinement effect of VO, resulting in Ga-VO reactive sites with the maximum availability. It is revealed by density functional theory calculations that Ga SAs are favorable for the selective adsorption of N2 at the catalyst surface, while VO can facilitate N2 activation and reduction subsequently. Benefiting from this coupled activity/selectivity design, high NH3 yield (24.47 μg h-1 mg-1) and FE (48.64%) are achieved at an extremely low overpotential of -0.1 V vs RHE.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.1c10059
Ag-O-Co Interface Modulation-Amplified Luminol Cathodic Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence,"© 2022 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.It remains a great challenge to develop effective strategies for improving the weak cathodic electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) of the luminol-dissolved O2 system. Interface modulation between metal and supports is an attractive strategy to improve oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Therefore, the design of electrocatalysts via interface modulation would provide new opportunities for the ECL amplification involving reactive oxygen species (ROSs). Herein, we have fabricated an Ag single-atom catalyst with an oxygen-bridged interface (Ag-O-Co) through the electrodeposition of Ag on a CoAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) modified indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode (Ags/LDH/ITO). Interestingly, it was found that the cathodic ECL intensity of the luminol-dissolved O2 system at the Ags/LDH/ITO electrode was extraordinarily enhanced in comparison with those at bare ITO and other Ag nanoparticle-based electrodes. The enhanced ECL performances of the Ags/LDH/ITO electrode were attributed to the increasing amounts of ROSs by electrocatalytic ORR in the Ag-O-Co interface. The electron redistribution of Ag and Co bimetallic sites could accelerate electron transfer, promote the adsorption of O2, and sufficiently activate O2 through a four-electron reaction pathway. Finally, the luminol cathodic ECL intensity was greatly improved. Our findings can provide inspiration for revealing the interface effects between metal and supports, and open up a new avenue to improve the luminol cathodic ECL.",Analytical Chemistry,10.1021/acs.analchem.2c00050
"A General Strategy for Engineering Single-Metal Sites on 3D Porous N, P Co-Doped Ti3C2TXMXene","© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Two-dimensional (2D) MXenes have been developed to stabilize single atoms via various methods, such as vacancy reduction and heteroatom-mediated interactions. However, anchoring single atoms on 3D porous MXenes to further increase catalytic active sites and thus construct electrocatalysts with high activity and stability remains unexplored. Here, we reported a general synthetic strategy for engineering single-metal sites on 3D porous N, P codoped Ti3C2TXnanosheets. Through a ""gelation-and-pyrolysis"" process, a series of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (Pt, Ir, Ru, Pd, and Au) supported by N, P codoped Ti3C2TXnanosheets with 3D porous structure can be obtained and serve as efficient catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result of the favorable electronic and geometric structure of N(O), P-coordinated metal atoms optimizing catalytic intermediates adsorption and 3D porous structure exposing the active surface sites and facilitating charge/mass transfer, the as-synthesized Pt SA-PNPM catalyst shows ∼20-fold higher activity than the commercial Pt/C catalyst for electrochemical HER over a wide pH range.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.1c09841
Synthetic strategies of single-atoms catalysts and applications in electrocatalysis,"© 2022Developing electrocatalysts with single atoms as active centers is highly expected based on their maximum efficiency in utilization of atoms as well as the possession of unique electronic characteristics. In this paper, the research progress of single-atom electrocatalysts on multiple energy conversion reactions over recent years is reviewed. The discussion begins with a background on the various types of single-atom electrocatalysts (SAECs). The paper then conducts a review of synthetic methods that use the latest microscopic and spectroscopic techniques to control atom dispersal and atomic decomposition characterization of metal sites. In view of the wide application of SAECs, the electrocatalytic study of SAECs was analyzed from the perspective of important electrochemical reactions such as ORR (oxygen reduction reaction), HER (hydrogen evolution reaction), OER (oxygen evolution reaction), CO2RR (carbon (IV) oxide reduction reaction) and NRR (nitrogen reduction reaction). A variety of successful attempts are exemplified to describe the catalytic synthetic strategies, characterization, and electrocatalysis applications. Finally, we identify challenges, and suggest future directions for nonprecious-metal SAECs within the burgeoning sector.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.139835
Achieving complete electrooxidation of ethanol by single atomic Rh decoration of Pt nanocubes,"Copyright © 2022 the Author(s)The development of single site electrocatalysts such as single-atom catalyst (SAC) has demonstrated the advantages of high precious metal utilization and tunable metal-support interfacial properties. However, the fundamental understanding of unalloyed single metal atom decorated on a metallic substrate is still lacking. Herein, we report unalloyed single atomic, partially oxidized Rh on the Pt nanocube surface as the electrocatalyst to completely oxidize ethanol to CO2at a record-low potential of 0.35 V. In situ X-ray absorption fine structure measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal that the single-atom Rh sites facilitate the C-C bond cleavage and the removal of the *CO intermediates. This work not only reveals the fundamental role of unalloyed, partially oxidized SAC in ethanol oxidation reaction but also offers a unique single-atom approach using low-coordination active sites on shape-controlled nanocatalysts to tune the activity and selectivity toward complicated catalytic reactions.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.2112109119
Computational screening of highly selective and active electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction on single-atom-embedded artificial holey SnN3 monolayers,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Billowy interest during nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) for single-atom catalysts (SACs) has been evoked by the discovery of single transition metal (TM) atom structures featured by TM-Nx coordinate sites as an excellent catalytic center. However, a great challenge of currently available SACs, far away from industrial requirement, is the low activity and poor selectivity. Therefore, in NRR, the first-principles high-throughput screening calculations were performed to evaluate the feasibility of a single TM atom (from Sc to Au) embedded an artificial holey defective SnN3 (d-SnN3) monolayer. Here, all TM atoms can be stably anchored on d-SnN3 (TM/d-SnN3), meanwhile, most of adsorbed N2 molecules can be favorably activated via the “σ donation - π* back-donation” interaction. Eventually, among 27 TM centers, V, Mo, Hf and Ta/d-SnN3 stand out because of extremely low limiting potential (-0.21, −0.40, −0.56 and −0.54 V, respectively), lower than majority of TM-based NRR catalysts and far below that of the Ru (0001) surface (0.98 V), indicative of fast kinetics and low energy cost of NRR. Moreover, their intrinsic characteristic, such as centralized spin-polarization on these TM atoms, high-efficient prohibition of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction is responsible for high selectivity with theoretical faradic efficiency of 100%. Also, multiple-level descriptors including ΔG∗N, ICOHP, and Φ were used to make the source of NRR activity clear, realizing an efficient and quick prescreening among different candidates. Particularly, their excellent durability, kinetic stability and synthetic accessibility guarantee the feasibility in real experimental conditions.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2021.11.093
Low-cost single-atom transition metals on two-dimensional SnO nanosheets for efficient hydrogen evolution catalysis in all pH-range,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The exploration of electrocatalysts with high performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in all media is essential for developing clean energies. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted wide attentions owing to their maximum atom utilization and excellent catalytic activity. In this work, the HER activities of transition metal (TM) (TM = Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) SACs on two-dimensional SnO monolayer are studied using density functional theory. We found that the low-cost TM SACs can exhibit high HER activity in wide pH-range. Especially, Co SACs show promising catalytic activity with the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH∗) as low as ∼ 0.015 eV, which are also high active in either acidic or alkaline environments. With the experimentally inevitable oxygen vacancies in SnO, the ΔGH∗ of Co, Ni and Cu SACs are almost zero, which are competitive with the precious catalyst Pt(1 1 1) (-0.09 eV). The exceptional HER activity is correlated to the enhanced electron states close to the Fermi level as well as the d-band center positions of the TM. Our work opens new avenues for engineering low-cost TM SACs with pH-universal HER performance, which is of great importance in practical applications.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.152021
Dual-metal atom incorporated N-doped graphenes as oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts: high activities achieved by site synergies,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Cheap and highly efficient electrocatalysts are needed to expedite the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis to provide clean and sustainable hydrogen energy. In this work, systematic first-principles calculations were conducted to investigate the detailed OER process over the popular N-doped graphenes containing low-cost single-metal atoms (MN4-gra; M = Fe, Co, Ni) and dual-metal atoms (homonuclear MMN6-gra and heteronuclear M1M2N6-gra). For the first time, two types of main reaction mechanisms with five possible reaction pathways were thoroughly considered: (1) the single-site OER occurs on a single-metal atom (M path) or on a single-carbon atom (C path); reaction intermediates transfer between a metal and a carbon atom (e.g., M-C-M or C-C-M path); (2) dual-site *O-*O coupling between two metal atoms (M-M path) or between a metal and a carbon atom (M-C path). The latter three pathways all could break the troublesome linear scaling relationships between different reaction intermediates due to the possible synergy of two catalytically active sites. Importantly, four dual-atom catalysts exhibit much lower theoretical overpotentials ηOER (M path: FeFeN6-gra 0.35 V and CoCoN6-gra 0.38 V; M-C-M (C-C-M) path: CoCoN6-gra 0.30 V, NiNiN6-gra 0.37 V, and FeCoN6-gra 0.33 V; M-M path: CoCoN6-gra 0.28 V and FeCoN6-gra 0.40 V; M-C path: FeFeN6-gra 0.33 V) than not only all the MN4-gra counterparts, but also the benchmark commercial RuO2 (ηOER: 0.47 V) and IrO2 (ηOER: 0.58 V) electrocatalysts. The origins of their superior catalytic activities are different: for the catalysts along the M path, it stems from the strong electronic regulation effect of the second metal atom on the single-atom site, whereas for those along the M-C-M (C-C-M) and M-M (M-C) ones it is ascribed to the transfer and coupling of intermediate adsorbates, respectively. All these diverse site synergies markedly alter the adsorptions of intermediates and optimize the reaction free energy profiles. The current work provides new insights into the emerging dual-atom catalysts at an atomic level, and the disclosed various reaction pathways and sophisticated synergistic effects as well as exact activity origins could help deeply understand and further design novel multi-site (electro)catalysts for wide energy application.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta10874c
A single-Pt-atom-on-Ru-nanoparticle electrocatalyst for CO-resilient methanol oxidation,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.Single Pt atom catalysts are key targets because a high exposure of Pt substantially enhances electrocatalytic activity. In addition, PtRu alloy nanoparticles are the most active catalysts for the methanol oxidation reaction. To combine the exceptional activity of single Pt atom catalysts with an active Ru support we must overcome the synthetic challenge of forming single Pt atoms on noble metal nanoparticles. Here we demonstrate a process that grows and spreads Pt islands on Ru branched nanoparticles to create single-Pt-atom-on-Ru catalysts. By following the spreading process by in situ TEM, we found that the formation of a stable single atom structure is thermodynamically driven by the formation of strong Pt–Ru bonds and the lowering of the surface energy of the Pt islands. The stability of the single-Pt-atom-on-Ru structure and its resilience to CO poisoning result in a high current density and mass activity for the methanol oxidation reaction over time.

A clicking confinement strategy to fabricate transition metal single-atom sites for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis,"© 2022 The Authors.Rechargeable zinc-air batteries call for high-performance bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.

Review-Oxygen Electrocatalysts based on Various Modulation Strategies for Rechargeable Li-O2Batteries,"© 2022 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS"").Li-O2 batteries as one of the rechargeable energy storage devices have aroused considerable interests due to the pleasant energy density. However, the development and application of Li-O2 batteries are still restricted by several challenging issues, including high overpotential, poor cycling life, and low round-trip efficiency, due to the sluggish electrochemical kinetic integrating oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR, OER) in the cathode. Therefore, rationally developing innovatively bifunctional electrocatalysts is critical to alleviate the above problems. Focusing on this, in this review, we first present a brief introduction of reaction mechanism and catalysts design requirement to comprehensively understand the correlation between electrochemical performance and electrocatalysts. After that, recent progress in advanced modulation strategies for Li-O2 batteries with vacancies engineering, doping modification, single-atom catalysis, illumination-assisted regulation, and hybrid composites synergy are systematically summarized.

Emerging Electrochemical Techniques for Probing Site Behavior in Single-Atom Electrocatalysts,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyConspectusSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) have aroused tremendous interest over the past decade, particularly in the community of energy and environment-related electrocatalysis. A rapidly growing number of recent publications have recognized it as a promising candidate with maximum atomic utilization, distinct activity, and selectivity in comparison to bulk catalysts and nanocatalysts. However, the complexity of localized coordination environments and the dispersion of isolated sites lead to significant difficulties when it comes to gaining insight into the intrinsic behavior of electrocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, the low metal loadings of most SACs make conventional ensemble measurements less likely to be accurate on the subnanoscale. Thus, it remains challenging to probe the activity and properties of individual atomic sites by available commercial instruments and analytical methods. In spite of this, continuing efforts have lately focused on the development of advanced measurement methodologies, which are very useful to the fundamental understanding of SACs. There have recently been a number of in situ/operando techniques applied to SACs, such as electron microscopy, spectroscopy, and other analysis methods, which support relevant functions to identify the active sites and reaction intermediates and to investigate the dynamic behavior of localized structures of the catalytic sites.This Account aims to present recent electrochemical probing techniques which can be used to identify single-atomic catalytic sites within solid supports. First, we describe the basic principles of molecular probe methods for the study and analysis of electrocatalytic site behavior. In particular, the in situ probing technique enabled by surface interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI-SECM) can measure the active site density and kinetic rate with high resolution. An alternative electrochemical probing technique is further demonstrated on the basis of single-entity electrochemistry, which allows the unique electrochemical imaging of the size and catalytic rate of single atoms, molecules, and clusters. The merits and limitations of different electrochemical techniques are then discussed, along with perspectives for future prospects. Apart from this, we further showcase the powerful capability of emerging electrochemical probing techniques for determining significant effects and properties of SACs for various electrocatalytic reactions, including oxygen reduction and evolution, hydrogen evolution, and nitrate reduction. Overall, electrochemical techniques with atomic resolution have greatly increased opportunities for observing, measuring, and understanding the surface and interface chemistry during energy conversion. In the future, it is anticipated that the development of electrochemical probing techniques will be advanced with innovative perspectives on the behavior and features of SACs. We hope that this Account can contribute in several ways to promoting the fundamental knowledge and technical progress of emerging electrochemical measurements for studying SACs.",Accounts of Chemical Research,10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00785
Copper coordinated with nitrogen in electrospun carbon nanofibers as a high-performance electrocatalyst for ORR,"© 2022 The AuthorsSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted much attention in the field of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) as a result of their high selectivity and effective atom utilization. Cu SACs are particularly difficult to prepare since copper is prone to agglomeration, which leads to the formation of metal particles. In this study, using sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC) as an organometallic copper source, carbon nanofibers incorporating Cu-N4 structures were prepared using electrospinning technology. This new type of Cu SAC has a huge surface area (1005.615 m2·g) and a 3D network structure, which are conducive to the exposure of more active sites as well as to electron conduction and material transport. Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy revealed that the Cu-N4 structure was preserved in the electrocatalyst, and was responsible for the catalytic activity towards the ORR. The Cu–N-CNFs exhibited higher catalytic activity and greater stability than commercial Pt/C in an alkaline medium, suggesting the possibility of using Cu SACs to replace commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts.",Electrochemistry Communications,10.1016/j.elecom.2022.107245
Highly Stable Co Single Atom Confined in Hierarchical Carbon Molecular Sieve as Efficient Electrocatalysts in Metal–Air Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle atoms catalysts’ (SACs) applications in the energy storage field are hindered by their insufficient stability and poor recyclability due to their oxidation and agglomeration. To address this challenge, herein, a Co-CMS composite material is synthesized by confining Co SACs into the highly ordered pores of the carbon molecular sieve (CMS). Related theoretical and experimental methods prove that the microporous trapping and hydroxyl doping of CMS are favorable for synergistically stabilizing the precursor and contributing to the subsequent conversion of single atoms with strong interactions between Co, O, and N. The unique 3D spiral pore structure of CMS facilitates the mass transfer of reactants and the highly dispersed Co single atoms confined in CMS increase the active sites. These properties are ideal for oxygen reduction reaction catalysts. Benefiting from the above-mentioned superiority, the Co-CMS cathode exhibits superior performance in a rechargeable Zn–air battery with a lower charge–discharge voltage gap of 0.77 V and a power density of 219 mW cm−2. The applications of Co-CMS catalysts are also extended to other metal–air batteries in this work, which further highlights the advantages of carbon molecular sieves in stabilizing SACs materials.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202103097
CO2 reduction reaction pathways on single-atom Co sites: Impacts of local coordination environment,"© 2022 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of SciencesSingle-atom catalysts have been proposed as promising electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). Co-N4 active sites have attracted wide attention owing to their excellent CO selectivity and activity. However, the effect of the local coordination environment of Co sites on CO2 reduction reaction pathways is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the CO2 reduction reaction pathways on Co-N4 sites supported on conjugated N4-macrocyclic ligands with 1,10-phenanthroline subunits (Co-N4-CPY) by density functional theory calculations. The local coordination environment of single-atom Co sites with N substituted by O (Co-N3O-CPY) and C (Co-N3C-CPY) was studied for comparison. The calculation results revealed that both C and O coordination break the symmetry of the primary CoN4 ligand field and induce charge redistribution of the Co atom. For Co-N4-CPY, CO was confirmed to be the main product of CO2RR. HCOOH is the primary product of Co-N3O-CPY because of the greatly increased energy barrier of CO2 to *COOH. Although the energy barrier of CO2 to *COOH is reduced on Co-N3C-CPY, the desorption process of *CO becomes more difficult. CH3OH (or CH4) are obtained by further *CO hydrogenation reduction when using Co-N3C-CPY. This work provides new insight into the effect of the local coordination environment of single-atom sites on CO2 reduction reaction pathways.",Chinese Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63893-7
Accelerated kinetics of alkaline hydrogen evolution/oxidation reactions on dispersed ruthenium sites through N and S dual coordination,"© 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Efficient, robust and cost-effective electrocatalysts that catalyze hydrogen evolution/oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) in alkaline media are highly demanded. Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as new promising candidates; however, the rational design of supports and the optimization of coordination environment between supports and metal atoms are challenging. In this work, we successfully fabricate atomically dispersed ruthenium (Ru) species, which are strongly coordinated by N and S dual heteroatoms on holey graphene (RuSA/NSG), as an excellent bifunctional catalyst for HER/HOR. In alkaline media, the developed catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 57.3 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−1 for HER, and its mass activity is about 5.8 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and Ru/C catalysts at an overpotential of 100 mV. Similarly, considerable HOR performance of RuSA/NSG is verified to be superior to Pt/C and Ru/C. Furthermore, X-ray-based spectroscopy measurements and density-functional theory calculations have confirmed that, compared with Ru-N4, the tailored Ru-N4-S2 with nearby S dopants can act as more active centers to greatly accelerate the sluggish HER/HOR kinetics in alkaline media. The present work provides a new atomic-level engineering strategy to modulate catalytic activities of SACs via the coordination design using dual heteroatoms on the carbon support.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Science China Chemistry,10.1007/s11426-021-1190-7
Deciphering the Precursor–Performance Relationship of Single-Atom Iron Oxygen Electroreduction Catalysts via Isomer Engineering,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle atom Fe–nitrogen–carbon (Fe–N–C) catalysts have high catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and are possible alternatives for Pt-based materials. However, the reasonable design and selection of precursors to establish their relationship with Fe–N–C catalyst performance is still a formidable task. Herein, precursors with controllable structures are easily achieved through isomer engineering, with the purpose of regulating the active site density and microscopic morphology of the final electrocatalyst. As-proof-of-concept, phenylenediamine isomers-based polymers are used as precursors to fabricate Fe–N–C catalysts. The Fe–PpPD-800 derived from p-phenylenediamine shows that the best ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2) reaches 0.892 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is better than the counterparts derived from o-phenylenediamine (Fe–PoPD-800) and m-phenylenediamine (Fe–PmPD-800), even surpassing commercial Pt/C (E1/2 = 0.881 V vs RHE). Furthermore, the self-made zinc–air battery based on Fe–PpPD-800 achieves high power density and specific capacity up to 242 mW cm−2 and 873 mA h gZn−1 respectively, a stable open circuit voltage of 1.45 V, and excellent cycling stability. This work not only proves the practicability of adjusting the catalytic activity of single-atom catalysts through isomer engineering, but also provides an approach to understand the relationship between precursors and target catalysts performance.",Small,10.1002/smll.202106122
Surface functionalization of polyaniline and excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction to produce hydrogen peroxide,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical two-electron oxygen reduction is an environmental-friendly and promising method to generate H2O2. However, a great challenge remains to develop more economic and effective electrocatalysts for practical application. Here, we have developed a CNT@PANI-NO electrocatalyst that is significantly different from the conventional electrocatalyst previously reported (such as metal, alloy, carbon materials doped with heteroatoms, metal single-atom catalysts). We firstly find that the polyaniline (PANI) treated by dilute nitric acid can be changed into the PANI-NO product with the functional group of –NO. Then we introduce the PANI-NO on the surface of carboxylated carbon nanotubes to obtain the CNT@PANI-NO nanocomposites, which exhibit excellent electrochemical performance to H2O2 production. The H2O2 selectivity of the typical CNT@PANI-NO is between 87% and 94% at the potential of 0.2–0.68 V (vs. RHE), the faradaic efficiency is close to 95% and the current density is up to 2.9 mA/cm2 (at 0.3 V) in alkaline condition. The DFT results give the origin of the catalytic activity. This study provides a new idea for the application of polymer in electrocatalysis and a new way to develop the high-performance 2e-ORR electrocatalyst.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.133921
Rationalization on high-loading iron and cobalt dual metal single atoms and mechanistic insight into the oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdRational design of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal loadings is essential to enhance the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reactions in metal-air batteries and proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, an effective plasma engineering strategy to construct Fe/Co dual single atoms densely dispersed on porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (Fe, Co SAs-PNCF) with a high mass loading of 9.8 wt% is proposed without any acid leaching. The electrocatalyst exhibits superior ORR performances in both alkaline and acidic media (e.g., Eonset = 1.04 V and E1/2 = 0.93 V). The N3-Fe-Co-N3 moieties are identified to be the main active sites by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory calculations. The in situ XAS and Raman spectroscopy quantitively reveal the decrease in oxidation states of Fe/Co and the increase in bond lengths of the Fe-N/Co-N in the N3-Fe-Co-N3 during the ORR. Benefitting from the high loading of single atoms and enhanced activity, the Fe, Co SAs-PNCF endows the Al-air batteries and PEMFCs with excellent discharge performances, demonstrating promising practical applications.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106793
Tailoring lithium-peroxide reaction kinetics with CuN2C2 single-atom moieties for lithium-oxygen batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) featuring maximized atom utilization are, in no doubt, playing an increasingly significant role in aprotic lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs). However, rational design and construction of SACs active sites remain enormously challenging due to the superficial understanding of their structure-function relationship. In this contribution, we provide new insight into the link between the catalytic effects of catalysts and the detailed nucleation/delithiation mechanisms of Li2O2 during the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER). Here, a CuN2C2 SACs electrocatalyst is tailored for LOBs by a confined self-initiated dispersing strategy. The exposed Cu-N2 moieties as the driving force centers can promote the formation of micron-sized flower-shaped lithium peroxide and further accelerate the decomposition kinetics of lithium peroxide via a one-electron transfer way in turn. Under the catalysis of CuN2C2 SACs, the LOB can operate with low discharge/charge polarization and long-term cycle stability. These encouraging results provide guidance to future design and activity promotion of efficient catalysts for LOBs.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106810
Confining Zero-Valent Platinum Single Atoms in α-MoC1−x for pH-Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle-atom electrocatalysts (SACs) toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have been extensively studied owing to their high mass activity and atom utilization. Although platinum (Pt) based SACs have been reported frequently, optimizing the metal–support interaction to achieve low valence state Pt species is still a challenge. Here, the carbon supported α-MoC1−x nanoparticles are used to anchor zero-valent Pt single atoms (PtSA/α-MoC1−x@C) as electrocatalyst for pH-universal HER. The PtSA/α-MoC1−x@C with optimized Pt loading of 0.75 wt% shows a low overpotential (21, 12, and 36 mV at 10 mA cm–2) and high turnover frequencies (27.00, 31.98, and 21.39 H2 s–1 at 100 mV) for HER under alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolyte conditions. Experimental evidence combing density functional theory calculations confirm that the charge polarization leads to a zero-valence state of Pt single atom and further optimized the adsorption/desorption energy of intermediates, further accelerating the reaction dynamics for HER.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202108464
Cu-N4 single atoms derived from metal-organic frameworks with trapped nitrogen-rich molecules and their use as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2021The development of noble-metal-free single atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) with both remarkable activity and durability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are in great demand for large-scale commercialization of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Here, we developed a novel strategy to fabricate high-performance Cu-SAs/NSs from pyrolysis of two-dimensional (2D) Cu/Zn bimetallic MOF. Specifically, nitrogen-rich molecules (melamine) were deliberately added to intrigue the self-assembly of Cu/Zn bimetallic MOF, and contribute to the formation of highly porous structure and abundant Cu-N4 active sites. With the enhanced accessibility of active sites and mass transport, the as-developed Cu-SAs/NSs display a remarkable ORR performance in alkaline media, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C and most of platinum group metals (PGMs)-free electrocatalysts reported to date. Notably, this facile strategy can be extended to fabricate other transition metal (TM, TM = Fe, Co, Ni)-based single atoms.

Modulation effect in adjacent dual metal single atom catalysts for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2021Nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a clean mode of energy conversion and the development of highly efficient NRR electrocatalysts under ambient conditions for industrial application is still a big challenge. Metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) has emerged as a class of single atom catalyst due to the unique geometric structure, high catalytic activity, and clear selectivity. Herein, we designed a series of dual metal single atom catalysts containing adjacent M-N-C dual active centers (MN4/M'N4-C) as NRR electrocatalysts to uncover the structure-activity relationship. By evaluating structural stability, catalytic activity, and selectivity using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, 5 catalysts, such as CrN4/M'N4-C (M’ = Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn), were determined to exhibit the best NRR catalytic performance with the limiting potential ranging from −0.64 V to −0.62 V. The CrN4 center acted as the main catalytic site and the adjacent M'N4 center could enhance the NRR catalytic activity by modulation effect based on the analysis of the electronic properties including the charge density difference, partial density of states (PDOS), and Bader charge variation. This study offers useful insights on understanding the structure-activity relationship of dual metal single atom catalysts for electrochemical NRR.",Chinese Chemical Letters,10.1016/j.cclet.2021.08.102
Metal-organic framework-derived carbon nanotubes with multi-active Fe-N/Fe sites as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for zinc-air battery,"© 2021 Science PressSustainable metal-air batteries demand high-efficiency, environmentally-friendly, and non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts with bifunctionality for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this research, novel functional carbon nanotubes with multi-active sites including well-dispersed single-atom iron throughout the walls and encapsulated ultrafine iron nanoparticles were synthesized as an electrocatalyst (FeNP@Fe-N-C) through one-step pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks. High-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy were applied to characterize the unique structure of the electrocatalyst. In comparison to the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 electrodes, the newly prepared FeNP@Fe-N-C presented a superb bifunctional performance with its narrow potential difference (Egap) of 0.73 V, which is ascribed to the metallic Fe nanoparticles that boosts the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the active sites with an enhanced O2 adsorption capacity of 7.88 cm3 g−1 and synergistically functionalizes the iron atoms dispersed on the nanotubes. A rechargeable zinc-air battery based on FeNP@Fe-N-C exhibited a superior open-circuit voltage (1.45 V), power density (106.5 mW cm−2), and stable cycling performance. The green technique developed in this work for the fabrication of functional nanotubes raises the prospect of making more efficient electrocatalysts for sustainable energy cells.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.08.019
Three-dimensional CoOOH nanoframes confining high-density Mo single atoms for large-current-density oxygen evolution,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Layered transition-metal oxyhydroxides (MOOHs) emerge as promising noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet are subject to a limited number of active sites at edges with an inactive basal plane. Herein, we report that a large number of in-plane active sites can be generated by confining high density of 16 wt% molybdenum single atoms in the basal-plane lattice of CoOOH (Mo-CoOOH). By constructing robust three-dimensional (3D) nanoframes to prevent layer-stacking and maximize exposure of active basal planes, the catalyst achieves an unprecedented OER activity at a large current density of 2000 mA cm−2, exhibiting the lowest overpotential of 400 mV among all previously reported catalysts with a high durability of over 120 hours. Multiple spectrometry characterization studies and first-principles calculations reveal that lattice-confined Mo atoms can bond moderately with OER intermediates, thereby serving as active sites for the reaction. This strategy provides a new path to design high-performance MOOH electrocatalysts with rich in-plane active sites.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta09729f
Highly active atomic Cu catalyst anchored on superlattice CoFe layered double hydroxide for efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalysis,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCDeveloping active, natural abundant and non-expensive electrocatalysts for large scale production and storage of clean hydrogen (H2) fuel is a prerequisite to drive stable water splitting reaction. Herein, atomic Cu species loaded on hierarchical flower-like CoFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) superlattice (denoted as Cux/CoFe LDHs) were firstly fabricated by a facile co-precipitation method followed by a room temperature treatment to load the atomic Cu species from alkaline copper salt solution. The superlattice structure was proved by the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Remarkably, benefiting from high level long ordering associated with vacant cation sites and defects, the unique superlattice structural features and the atomic Cu % loading onto the LDHs matrix, the obtained Cux/CoFe LDHs electrocatalyst exhibited superior activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The loaded atomic Cu species improves the electronic structure and provides more exposed active sites due to synergetic electron coupling between Copper and the LDHs. These atomic species have outstanding potentials for achieving high selectivity and reactivity in electrocatalysis and heterocatalysis. Importantly, the efficient resulted Cu4.76/CoFe LDHs electrode in which the atomic Cu % loading ratio is 4.76% showed the best electrocatalytic activity which only required the much lower overpotential of 253 mV to reach 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 63 mV/decade in 1 M KOH. This electrocatalyst possessed unique superior features to many other state-of-the-art earth-abundant electrocatalysts. This work paves a facile and novel method for enhancing the catalytic activity of CoFe LDHs based electrocatalyst, which may be extended to the synthesis of future electrocatalysts having highly active OER performance.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.069
Atomic Tuning of Single-Atom Fe-N-C Catalysts with Phosphorus for Robust Electrochemical CO2 Reduction,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyThe electrochemical reduction of CO2 to produce carbon-based fuels and chemicals possesses huge potentials to alleviate current environmental problems. However, it is confronted by great challenges in the design of active electrocatalysts with low overpotentials and high product selectivity. Here we report the atomic tuning of a single-Fe-atom catalyst with phosphorus (Fe-N/P-C) on commercial carbon black as a robust electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. The Fe-N/P-C catalyst exhibits impressive performance in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, with a high Faradaic efficiency of 98% and a high mass-normalized turnover frequency of 508.8 h-1 at a low overpotential of 0.34 V. On the basis of ex-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations, we reveal that the tuning of P in single-Fe-atom catalysts reduces the oxidation state of the Fe center and decreases the free-energy barrier of *CO intermediate formation, consequently maintaining the electrocatalytic activity and stability of single-Fe-atom catalysts.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c04382
A durable half-metallic diatomic catalyst for efficient oxygen reduction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Single atom metal-nitrogen-carbon materials have shown immense potential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while the development of durable catalysts with high reactivity remains a great challenge. Herein, by rationally designing a diatomic catalyst Fe/Zn-N-C based on theoretical screening, we propose a unique half-metallic electronic structure induced by cooperation of Fe and Zn. This structure populates spontaneous spin-polarized conduction electrons at the Fermi level, resulting in an enhancement in free O2 capture and bonding. Meanwhile, the active center of FeN4 is well preserved with Zn-N as the sacrificial bond during the ORR. Fe/Zn-N-C therefore achieved remarkable ORR activities in both acidic and alkaline media as well as impressive long-term durability that outperform most state-of-the-art catalysts and commercial benchmarks. This work advances our fundamental knowledge of the structure-performance relationship for ORR electrocatalysts, which could potentially inspire the exploration of high-performance candidates via electronic structure modulation.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/d1ee03194e
Diminishing the Uncoordinated N Species in Co-N-C Catalysts toward Highly Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyAtomically dispersed metal and nitrogen codoped carbon (M-N-C) catalysts with N-coordinated metal (MNx) sites have shown compelling performance in electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR). However, extra uncoordinated N species commonly coexist with MNx sites in M-N-C, which are impossible to ignore due to their inevitable interference in catalytic performance. Considering this, we developed high-performance Co-N-C for ECR by diminishing the uncoordinated N species. The resulting electrocatalyst displays a CO faradic efficiency (FECO) of 99.4% with a CO current density of −24.8 mA·cm-2 at a low overpotential of 0.49 V in an H-type cell, and a high FECO over 90% is obtained in a flow cell within a wide current density window (50-600 mA·cm-2), exceeding all reported Co-N-C catalysts. Density functional theory calculations reveal that isolated CoN4 sites can reduce the energy barrier required for the formation of COOH* and suppress the occurrence of hydrogen evolution compared with CoN4 sites with extra uncoordinated N species, thus resulting in enhanced activity and selectivity in CO production.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.1c05029
Surface Diels-Alder adducts on multilayer graphene for the generation of edge-enriched single-atom FeN4 sites for ORR and OER electrocatalysis†,"This journal is © The Royal Society of ChemistryThe assembly of atomically dispersed iron-nitrogen (FeN4) sites into graphitic structures is a promising approach for sustainable production of bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen electroreduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions. In addition, single-atom FeN4 sites at the edges of carbon substrates provide higher electrocatalytic performance than those in plane. Unfortunately, the conventional high-temperature pyrolysis method does not allow the generation of edge-enriched FeN4 single-atom sites. Herein, a novel low-temperature and solvent-free mechanochemical synthesis based on the use of dipyridylpyridazine (dppz) functionalized multilayer graphene as a starting material is proposed for precisely engineered location of these FeN4 active sites at the edges. After careful characterization of these dppz-based materials, the ORR and OER electrocatalytic performance was investigated, demonstrating the efficient formation of FeN4 sites at the edges as well as their excellent bifunctional behavior for the ORR and OER.

TMN4 complex embedded graphene as efficient and selective electrocatalysts for chlorine evolution reactions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In the industrial large-scale chlor-alkali process, the electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is a crucial half anodic reaction. However, the concomitant oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is unavoidable by using the noble metal-based dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) as CER benchmark catalysts. Through purposely screening six TMN4 complexes embedded graphene with the demonstrated low performance of OER, our density functional theory (DFT) results predict that NiN4 complex embedded graphene (NiN4@G) can efficiently catalyse the CER. This single-atom catalyst (SAC) shows superior CER activity with the ultralow thermodynamic overpotential of 0.014 V via the Cl* intermediate instead of the formation of the ClO*. Moreover, its high theoretical overpotential of OER inherently promotes the selectivity of chlorine evolution. The analyses of the bonding mechanism between TM and Cl atoms reveal that their electrostatic attraction forces can be a good descriptor for the discovery of high-performance CER electrocatalysts. Our findings may broaden the scope of CER catalysts design beyond DSAs with the maximized metal atom utilization.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry,10.1016/j.jelechem.2022.116071
A novel 2D Co3(HADQ)2 metal-organic framework as a highly active and stable electrocatalyst for acidic oxygen reduction,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Efficient and robust electrocatalysts for acidic Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for the proton exchange membrane hydrogen fuel cells. However, the current electrocatalysts suffer from the stability issues in the acidic enviorment during ORR. Herein, we introduce a new layer-stacked two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic framework (MOF), Co3(HADQ)2 (HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline), synthesized for the first time. This novel MOF material shows the extremely high conductivity of 8,385.744 S/m with extraordinary activity (E1/2 = 0.836 V vs. RHE, n = 3.93, and jL = 5.31 mAcm−2) and an exceptional stability (up to 20,000 cycles) as the electrocatalyst for ORR in an acidic media (pH = 0.29), outperforming most of the state of the art Metal-N-C and single-atom electrocatalysts for acidic ORR.

The synergetic effect of an aqua ligand and metal site on the performance of single-atom catalysts in H2O2 synthesis: A density functional theory study,"© the Owner Societies.Studying the effect of the coordination field on the catalytic property is critical for the rational design of outstanding electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis. Herein, via density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations, we built an effective computational framework to identify the synergetic effect of an aqua ligand and metal ion on the 2e- ORR catalytic performance under gas condition and aqua solvent. Specifically, the screening results of 29 single-atom catalysts (SACs), TM@C6N6 (TM = transition metal), indicated that Cu@C6N6 features excellent catalytic property with thermal stability, lowest 2e- ORR overpotential (0.02 V) and high selectivity of 99.99%. Once an aqua ligand binds with the Cu site, the activity is reduced to the overpotential of 0.42 V and the selectivity decreased slightly (99.98%) due to the reduction of the adsorption strength for the reaction intermediates. A combination of geometric structures and electronic properties revealed that such changes are correlated with the charge of the Cu site. Furthermore, based on molecular orbital theory, the essence of the high catalytic property deeply lies in the effect of the moderate electron back donation bond (dyz & dxz→) between Cu and O2. This work will provide a route to better design high-performance SACs for H2O2 synthesis effectively.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d1cp05342f
Precisely Constructing Orbital Coupling-Modulated Dual-Atom Fe Pair Sites for Synergistic CO2 Electroreduction,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyElectrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) provides an attractive pathway to achieve a carbon-neutral energy cycle. Single-atom catalysts (SAC) have shown unique potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but their structural simplicity prevents them from breaking linear scaling relationships. In this study, we develop a feasible strategy to precisely construct a series of electrocatalysts featuring well-defined single-atom and dual-site iron anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (Fe1-N-C and Fe2-N-C). The Fe2-N-C dual-atom electrocatalyst (DAC) achieves enhanced CO Faradaic efficiency above 80% in wider applied potential ranges along with higher turnover frequency (26,637 h-1) and better durability compared to SAC counterparts. Furthermore, based on in-depth experimental and theoretical analysis, the orbital coupling between the iron dual sites decreases the energy gap between antibonding and bonding states in *CO adsorption.

Atomically dispersed Co-N-C electrocatalysts synthesized by a low-speed ball milling method for proton exchange membrane fuel cells,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Atomically dispersed cobalt-nitrogen-carbon (Co-N-C) catalysts have appeared as potential substitutes to costly noble-metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). After carrying out research for a period of time, great progress has been made in preparing atomically dispersed catalysts by pyrolysis of the ZIF-8 precursor. However, the current synthesis method has many disadvantages, such as low reaction conversion, pollution and high cost. To overcome these shortcomings, a low-speed ball milling method was applied to synthesize the precursor of Co-N-C catalysts. The conversion efficiency of the precursor and metal doping rate were greatly improved by ball milling in a micro-solvent environment. Moreover, the environmentally friendly synthesis process does not involve a large amount of organic solvent and metal ions. In addition to the detailed characterization of the single-atom properties of the catalyst by the X-ray absorption fine structure and other means, and a thorough electrochemical characterization demonstrates its ORR capacities (E1/2 = 0.78 V) in acidic media.

Size-dependent selectivity of iron-based electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2reduction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Applying non-precious metal catalysts to electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) to CO efficiently, rather than gold-based nanomaterials, is of practical significance. Here, we adopt zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) to assist the synthesis of Fe metal catalysts with various sizes, ranging from single atoms to over 100 nm. As a result, the CO2 reduction performance of Fe metal catalysts with different particle sizes is different. Dominantly, Fe single-atomic sites exhibit optimum activity in producing CO, presenting a current density of 46.5 mA cm-2, with nearly 100% faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO (at -0.9 V vs. RHE), while the result for 7.6 nm Fe nanoparticles is slightly lower (ca. 92%). With further increasing the Fe particle size, the CO2RR performance weakens and allows the H2 evolution reaction (HER), which demonstrates the size-dependent selectivity of iron-based electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the active sites to be discrete Fe2+ ions, coordinated to the pyrrolic nitrogen (N) atoms of the N-doped carbon support.

Single-atom catalyst of TM@D-silicene - An effective way to reduce N2into ammonia,"© the Owner Societies.Nowadays, the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) still faces great challenges. It's significant to design the electrocatalysts with excellent activity and high selectivity. Herein, the 28 single atom catalysts of transition metal atoms anchored on defective silicene (TM@D-silicene) are designed for electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions. Two independent screening schemes are proposed to screen the potential SAC candidate. The criteria of Ebin < 0 eV, ΔG∗N2< -0.1 eV, ΔG∗H > ΔG∗N2, and the lowest ΔG∗NNH in scheme I, as well as ΔG∗N2< -0.1 eV, smaller G∗NNH and larger G∗NH2 in scheme II are utilized in the screening procedure. Finally, Cr@D-silicene is picked out since it performs well in the aspects of N2 adsorption, selectivity and catalytic activity of NRR. Moreover, the electronic properties are systematically investigated to clarify why the Cr@D-silicene is qualified for NRR from the perspective of the strong interaction between N2 and Cr, the continuous activation of the N2 molecule, charge transfer and distribution.

Mutual modulation via charge transfer and unpaired electrons of catalytic sites for the superior intrinsic activity of N2 reduction: From highthroughput computation assisted with a machine learning perspective,"© 2022 Royal Society of Chemistry. All rights reserved.Electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) have attracted ever-growing attention due to their applications in renewable energy alternative processes to fossil fuels. However, the activation of the inert N-N bond requires multiple complex charge injections, which complicates the design of the catalysts. Here, by combining atomic-scale screening and machine learning (ML) methods, we explore the rational design of NRR single-atom catalysts (SACs) supported by molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Our work reveals that the activity of NRR SACs is highly dependent on the number of unpaired d electrons of TMs, with ""positive"" samples with high activity favoring higher values while ""negative"" cases distribute at lower values, both varying with the doping conditions of the host. We find that the substitution of sulfur with boron can activate the intrinsic NRR activity of certain TMs such as Ti and V, which are otherwise inactive over pristine MoS2. Importantly, among the various descriptors used in ML, the charged state of adsorbed TMs plays a key role in donating an electron to the π∗ anti-bonding orbital of N2via the back-donation mechanism. Our work shows a feasible strategy for the rational design of NRR SACs and retrieval of the decisive feature of active catalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta10688k
Machine learning assisted high-throughput screening of transition metal single atom based superb hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryCarbon-based transition metal (TM) single-atom catalysts (SACs) have shown great potential toward electrochemical water splitting and H2 production. Given that two-dimensional (2D) materials are widely exploited for sustainable energy conversion and storage applications, the optimization of SACs with respect to diverse 2D materials is of importance. Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) approaches, we highlight a new perspective for the rational design of TM-SACs. We have tuned the electronic properties of ∼364 rationally designed catalysts by embedding 3d/4d/5d TM single atoms in diverse substrates including g-C3N4, π-conjugated polymer, pyridinic graphene, and hexagonal boron nitride with single and double vacancy defects each with a mono- or dual-type non-metal (B, N, and P) doped configuration. In ML analysis, we use various types of electronic, geometric and thermodynamic descriptors and demonstrate that our model identifies stable and high-performance HER electrocatalysts. From the DFT results, we found 20 highly promising candidates which exhibit excellent HER activities (|ΔGH*| ≤ 0.1 eV). Remarkably, Pd@B4, Ru@N2C2, Pt@B2N2, Fe@N3, Fe@P3, Mn@P4 and Fe@P4 show practically near thermo-neutral binding energies (|ΔGH*| = 0.01-0.02 eV).

Detailed material characterizations confirm that the as-prepared catalysts possess a well-defined fibrous structure with hierarchical pores, large specific surface area, and uniformly distributed Fe2O3/FeNx active sites. Further, it exhibits excellent ORR performance with high onset potential, half-wave potential, and current density in both alkaline and acidic media. And these electrocatalysts show excellent long-term performance and tolerance to methanol, exceeding the properties of commercial platinum catalysts. Additionally, the Fe2O3/FeNx@CNF electrocatalyst prepared in this study exhibits high discharge voltage, excellent power density, and cycling durability in Zn–air batteries. Notably, the detailed analyses demonstrate the co-existence of Fe2O3 nanoparticles and FeNx active sites boost the ORR catalytic activity of the hybrid catalyst. These new findings, particularly the enhancement of intrinsic activity of FeNx sites brought about by Fe2O3 nanoparticles, provide insights into the rational design of hybrid single-atom ORR electrocatalysts.",Advanced Materials Interfaces,10.1002/admi.202101904
In-Silico Screening the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction on Single-Atom Electrocatalysts Anchored on MoS2,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.We show that a Single-Atom Electrocatalyst (SAC) for the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) can provide an environmentally green alternative to the Haber–Bosch high-temperature high-pressure process, replacing the water gas shift production of H2 with H extracted from water. Anchoring the single atom on a two-dimensional substrate provides control to tune NRR catalytic performance toward a SAC possessing high utilization, high activity, and high selectivity. Experimental results suggest that this can significantly improve the activity and selectivity of NRR, but the specific reaction mechanism remains uncertain. This makes it difficult to select new catalytic materials for further optimization. Here we use Density Functional Theory to study the NRR catalytic mechanism on a catalytic model using a MoS2 substrate to support a single atom site. We correct for solvation effects on the electrochemical reactions. We started with Fe@MoS2, for which there are promising experimental reports, and conducted a systematic study of the NRR reaction mechanisms. These results show that N2 adsorption, hydrogenation of N2, desorption of NH3, and Hydrogen Evolution are all critical steps affecting the reaction rates. Based on these steps, we scanned 23 transition metal elements to find improved catalysts. We identified Ir@MoS2 (Mo top site) as the best candidate, predicted to have good catalytic activity and selectivity with 64.11% Faraday Efficiency. These results on the mechanism for NRR and the in silico search for alternative catalysts provide new promising targets for synthesizing novel and efficient SAC@MoS2 NRR catalysts.",Topics in Catalysis,10.1007/s11244-021-01546-6
Strategy for boosting Co-Nx content for oxygen reduction reaction in aqueous metal-air batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalyst is the pivotal component promoting the kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction in aqueous metal-air batteries. However, the content of increased bond as the active species is usually limited by the metal loading, tiny pore canal, insufficient nitrogen further restraining the electrocatalytic effectiveness of single-atom catalysts in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, Co, N-dual doped carbon (Co/NNC) is prepared by a versatile strategy of the combination approach of SiO2 template with extra nitrogen source. Based on ZIF-67 prepared with the assistance of SiO2 template, the extra nitrogen source was introduced in the high-temperature pyrolysis procedure. The material characterizations of XRD, SEM, HRTEM, BET, Raman and XPS are conducted to synthetically analyze the functional role of extra nitrogen source.

Atomic Fe–N4/C in Flexible Carbon Fiber Membrane as Binder-Free Air Cathode for Zn–Air Batteries with Stable Cycling over 1000 h,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHNoble-metal-free, durable, and high-efficiency electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) are vital for rechargeable Zn–air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a flexible and free-standing carbon fiber membrane immobilized with atomically dispersed Fe–N4/C catalysts (Fe/SNCFs-NH3) is synthesized and used as air cathode for ZABs. The intertwined fibers with hierarchical nanopores facilitate the gas transportation, electrolyte infiltration and electron transfer. The large specific surface area exposes a high concentration of Fe–N4/C sites embedded in the carbon matrix. Modulation of local atomic configurations by sulfur doping in Fe/SNCFs-NH3 catalyst leads to excellent ORR and enhanced OER activities. The as-synthesized Fe/SNCFs-NH3 catalyst demonstrates a positive half-wave potential of 0.89 V and a small Tafel slope of 70.82 mV dec–1, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (0.86 V/94.74 mV dec–1) and most reported M–Nx/C (M = Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover the crucial role of S doping in regulating ORR and OER activities. The liquid-state ZABs with Fe/SNCFs-NH3 catalyst as air cathode deliver a large peak power density of 255.84 mW cm–2 and long-term cycle durability over 1000 h. Solid-state ZAB shows stable cycling at various flat/bent/flat states, demonstrating great prospects in flexible electronic device applications.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202105410
"Study on the Structure-Activity Relationship Between Single-Atom, Cluster and Nanoparticle Catalysts in a Hierarchical Structure for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction","© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHLiterature reports have shown that in primary structures, single-atom catalysts exhibit better performance than cluster and nanoparticles due to their maximum atom utilization and the fine-tuning of the electronic structure of the active sites. Hierarchical structures have recently been extensively studied because of increased active sites and orderliness of channels significantly improves the catalytic performance compare to primary structures especially in nanoparticles, however, the different sized effect of catalysts research has not been reported. Herein, a unique hollow double-shell structure (a distinct cavity-containing) is used as a hierarchical model to study the possible difference between single atom, cluster, and nanoparticle and to establish the corresponding structure-activity relationship. Three Co catalysts are prepared: single atoms (Co-Catalyst-1), clusters (Co-Catalyst-2, 0.5–1 nm), and nanoparticles (Co-Catalyst-3, ≈5 nm) and their oxygen-reduction capacity is evaluated. The unique electronic interactions, the strong electron-withdrawing ability of N in Co–N4 (Co-Catalyst-1), attract electrons from the electrode to Co, specifically by expediting the generation and transformation of the rate-determining step intermediates *OOH. The variant spatial structure which is caused by Co atom aggregation, and led to surface area, pore size, and carbon disorder, is a distinct, therefore significant variation in mass and charge transport efficiency, and activities.",Small,10.1002/smll.202105487
Unveiling the underlying mechanism of nitrogen fixation by a new class of electrocatalysts two-dimensional TM@g-C4N3 monosheets,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The potential of TM atoms embedded g-C4N3 as a new class of electrocatalysts (TM@g-C4N3, TM = 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal) towards nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) were systematically investigated through the combination of high-throughput screening and first-principles calculations. Among 30 candidate materials, TM@g-C4N3 (TM = V, Tc, Os, Pt) exhibited the highest activity for electrocatalytic N2 reduction to produce NH3. Particularly, V@g-C4N3 is identified as the most active catalyst for NRR with onset potential of −0.37 V. Interestingly, a volcano curve between Uonset (onset potential) and ΔEads(*N2) (the adsorption energy of N2) is established, and thus ΔEads(*N2) can be used as a descriptor to characterize the activity of catalysts. Among all investigated catalysts, the lowest onset potential of V@g-C4N3 can be attributed to its moderate adsorption energies for N2. After in-deep analysis of the intrinsic properties of the four catalysts, we found that the increasing order of catalytic activity is consistent with the increasing order of d-band center (εd) of the four catalysts. In addition, the excellent thermal stability of the four catalysts is verified via simulated annealing at 500 K for 10 ps. Furthermore, three catalysts TM@g-C4N3 (TM = V, Tc, Pt) demonstrate good selectivity. Therefore, V@g-C4N3 is a promising electrocatalyst for NRR. Our work opens the way for g-C4N3 as a new type of support to construct efficient single-atom catalyst for electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis. The predicted TM@g-C4N3 catalysts will provide useful guidance for experimental synthesis and rational design of catalysts in future.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151839
Highly active atomically dispersed platinum-based electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction achieved by defect anchoring strategy,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) can achieve ultimate atomic utilization of precious metals to improve water splitting's economy. However, active sites in SACs are usually insufficient. Therefore, we propose the use of porous Co1NC which is rich in defects as support to prepare Pt1/Co1NC by mild electrochemical reduction at room temperature. Pt1/Co1NC showed record-high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, with an overpotential of only 4.15 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Its mass activity reached 32.4 A mg−1Pt at an overpotential of 20 mV, which is 54 times that of Pt/C. The turnover frequency was up to 32.86 s−1 at 20 mV, with excellent stability in long-term service. Our strategy suggests that nitrogen/carbon defects are vital for anchoring&forming monodispersed Pt active sites while preventing agglomeration. These sites possess low energy barriers, as verified by theoretical simulations. Therefore, our method presents a technical breakthrough for reducing cost of hydrogen energy.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120830
Single Ir atom anchored in pyrrolic-N4 doped graphene as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for the ORR/OER: a computational study,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.The development of highly-efficient electrocatalysts with bifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction. (OER) still remains a great challenge for the large-scale application of renewable energy conversion and storage technologies. Herein, by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we systematically explored the potential of pyrrolic-N doped graphene (pyrrolic-N4-G) supported various transition metal atoms (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Ru, Pd, W, Os, Ir, and Pt) as electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER. Our results revealed that these TM/pyrrolic-N4-G candidates exhibit high electrochemical stability due to their positive dissolution potentials. Especially, the Ir/pyrrolic-N4-G can perform as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER with the low overpotentials (ηORR = 0.34 V and ηOER = 0.32 V). Interestingly, multiple-level descriptors, including energy descriptor (ΔGOH* - ΔGO*), (ΔGOH*), structure descriptor (φ), and d-band center (ε) can well rationalize the origin of the high catalytic activity of Ir/pyrrolic-N4-G for the ORR/OER. Our findings not only further enrich the SACs, but also open a new avenue to develop novel 2D materials-based SACs for highly efficient oxygen electrocatalysts.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.045
CoN4 active sites in locally distorted carbon structure for efficient oxygen reduction reaction via regulating coordination environment,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Adjusting the coordination environment of active sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a desired method to realize efficient energy conversion. Herein, we synthesized a single atom Co catalyst (Co-SA/NC) with CoN4 active sites in locally distorted carbon configuration via a coordination-intercalation assisted strategy. The distinctive existing form of CoN4 structure has been confirmed according to X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy. The Co-SA/NC displays satisfactory ORR performance with higher half-wave potential of 0.89 V and kinetic current density (Jk) of 15.4 mA cm−2 at 0.85 V in alkaline solution, than those of Pt/C (0.87 V and 8.7 mA cm−2). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that locally distorted CoN4 sites are instrumental in adsorption/desorption of oxygen species, promoting the reaction kinetics of ORR. Furthermore, the fast ORR kinetics is proved by small Tafel slope of 57.9 mV/dec. Applying Co-SA/NC as air electrode in Al-air battery, it presents high specific capacity (1992.7 mAh gAl−1) and energy density (2466.7 Wh kgAl−1) at 200 mA cm−2. The electrocatalyst with unique coordination configuration for M-N4 active sites at atomic level will have wide applications in regulating its intrinsic activity.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.132119
Unraveling electrochemical oxygen reduction mechanism on single-atom catalysts by a computational investigation,"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons LtdThe extension of low-expense and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of importance to improve the performance of metal-air batteries and fuel cells. In this work, we unravel the ORR electrocatalytical mechanisms on a series of transition metal atom-doped on the defect graphene (TM@sv-graphene) by carrying out spin-polarized first-principles computations. The formation energy of the TM@sv-graphene, which is related to its stability, along with the binding energy of O2, OOH, 2OH, OH, and O species are evaluated. The calculations of Gibbs free energy show that two different pathways, O* mechanism and 2OH* mechanism, of ORR compete with each other based on the structures of intermediates (OOH, 2OH, OH and O). It is found that Co, Rh, Ir, Pt, and Mn@sv-graphene favor the O* mechanism while Ag, Au, Cd, Cu, Zn, Fe, Ni, Pd, Sc, Cr, Ti, Zr, and V@sv-graphene strongly promote the 2OH* mechanism. The overpotential (η) of the ORR is predicted and can be a valid descriptor that manifests the catalytic activity of different TM@sv-graphene. Among these catalysts, the Pd@sv-graphene (η = 1.20 V) exhibits the best activity for the ORR. The results provide new insight into electrochemical mechanism of ORR for novel single-atom electrocatalyst.",International Journal of Energy Research,10.1002/er.7222
High-throughput screening of carbon-supported single metal atom catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Carbon-supported transition metal single atoms are promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. Since there are many types of carbon supports and transition metals, the accurate prediction of the components with high activity through theoretical calculations can greatly save experimental time and costs. In this work, the ORR catalytic properties of 180 types single-atom catalysts (SACs) composed of the eight representative carbon-based substrates (graphdiyne, C2N, C3N4, phthalocyanine, C-coordination graphene, N-coordination graphene, covalent organic frameworks and metal-organic frameworks) and 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal elements are investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The adsorption free energy of OH* is proved a universal descriptor capable of accurately prediction of the ORR catalytic activity. It is found that the oxygen reduction reaction overpotentials of all the researched SACs follow one volcano shape very well with the adsorption free energy of OH*. Phthalocyanine, N-coordination graphene and metal-organic frameworks stand out as the promising supports for single metal atom due to the relatively lower overpotentials. Notably, the Co-doped metal-organic frameworks, Ir-doped phthalocyanine, Co-doped N-coordination graphene, Co-doped graphdiyne and Rh-doped phthalocyanine show extremely low overpotentials comparable to that of Pt (111). The study provides a guideline for design and selection of carbon-supported SACs toward oxygen reduction reaction. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research,10.1007/s12274-021-3598-2
Single-atomic Fe anchored on hierarchically porous carbon frame for efficient oxygen reduction performance,"© 2021Exploring platinum group metal-free electrocatalysts with superior catalytic performance and favorable durability for oxygen reduction reaction is a remaining bottleneck in process of developing sustainable techniques in energy storage and conversion. Herein, a hierarchical porous single atomic Fe electrocatalyst (Fe/Z8-E-C) is rationally designed and synthesized via acid etching, calcination, adsorption of Fe precursor and recalcination processes. This unique electrocatalyst Fe/Z8-E-C shows excellent oxygen reduction performance with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V in 0.1 mol/L KOH, 30 mV superior to that of commercial Pt/C (0.86 V), which is also significantly higher than that of typical Fe-doped ZIF-8 derived carbon nanoparticles (Fe/Z8-C) with a half-wave potential of 0.84 V. Furthermore, Fe/Z8-E-C-based Zn-air battery exhibits greatly enhanced peak power density and specific capacity than those of original Fe/Z8-C, verifying the remarkable performance and practicability of this specially designed hierarchical structure due to its efficient utilization of the active sites and rapid mass transfer. This present work proposes a new method to rationally synthesize single atom electrocatalysts loaded on hierarchical porous frame materials for catalysis and energy conversion.",Chinese Chemical Letters,10.1016/j.cclet.2021.05.052
CO2 electroreduction performance of transition metals supported on g-C(CN)3 monolayer with specific TMN3 active sites,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) represents a fascinating route for converting atmospheric CO2 to valuable chemicals, and a variety of intermediates are involved in the different CO2RR pathways. However, it has been hampered by the lack of highly effective electrocatalysts so far. Here, the performance of single 3d non-precious transition metals supported on g-C(CN)3 monolayers [TM-C(CN)3, TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, respectively] as CO2RR electrocatalysts was systematically investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The data indicate that all these TM atoms can strongly interact with the g-C(CN)3 substrate, and the TM active sites possess high CO2RR activity and specific selectivity through *OCHO intermediate. Particularly, Sc-, Co–, and Ni-C(CN)3 monolayers are identified as effective CO2RR electrocatalysts due to the low limiting potentials (- 0.28, − 0.42, and − 0.46 V, respectively), whose excellent performances are mainly attributed to the specific TMN3 active sites. Therefore, this work sheds light on g-C(CN)3 monolayer as an excellent supporting material, and will motivate more experimental and theoretical researches to further explore other potential two-dimensional porous carbon-based materials with specific TMN3 active sites for CO2RR.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151544
Sublayer-enhanced atomic sites of single atom catalysts through in situ atomization of metal oxide nanoparticles†,"This journal is © The Royal Society of ChemistryCarbon supported single atom catalysts (SACs) show outstanding potential as effective electrocatalysts in energy storage and conversion devices. However, the low surface-active site density associated with most SACs constrains their practical applications. By controlling the layers of FeSA through the in situ atomization of graphene supported metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs), we demonstrate that the Fe-N4-C active sites increase from 1 to 3 layers as the catalyst loading increases. The turnover frequency (TOF) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is doubled because the sublayer Fe-Nx-C could tune the electron density by increasing the energy gap between the d-band centre and the fermi level, weakening the adsorption of intermediates and further reducing the reaction overpotential in comparison to a single-layer Fe-N4. The sublayer-enhanced catalysts achieve an optimum activity for the ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.901 V under alkaline conditions and 0.74 V under acidic conditions, significantly higher performance in comparison to that of single layer active sites. Potential applications of these newly-developed catalysts were demonstrated in Zn-air batteries and fuel cells. This work provides a new way to achieve high TOF by controlling the layer of single atom active sites and offers new strategies to overcome the low-density atomic sites for SACs.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/d1ee03311e
Atomic Metal-Support Interaction Enables Reconstruction-Free Dual-Site Electrocatalyst,"© Real bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction have to be the ones that exhibit a steady configuration during/after reaction without irreversible structural transformation or surface reconstruction. Otherwise, they can be termed as ""precatalysts""rather than real catalysts. Herein, through a strongly atomic metal-support interaction, single-atom dispersed catalysts decorating atomically dispersed Ru onto a nickel-vanadium layered double hydroxide (LDH) scaffold can exhibit excellent HER and OER activities. Both in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and operando Raman spectroscopic investigation clarify that the presence of atomic Ru on the surface of nickel-vanadium LDH is playing an imperative role in stabilizing the dangling bond-rich surface and further leads to a reconstruction-free surface. Through strong metal-support interaction provided by nickel-vanadium LDH, the significant interplay can stabilize the reactive atomic Ru site to reach a small fluctuation in oxidation state toward cathodic HER without reconstruction, while the atomic Ru site can stabilize the Ni site to have a greater structural tolerance toward both the bond constriction and structural distortion caused by oxidizing the Ni site during anodic OER and boost the oxidation state increase in the Ni site that contributes to its superior OER performance. Unlike numerous bifunctional catalysts that have suffered from the structural reconstruction/transformation for adapting the HER/OER cycles, the proposed Ru/Ni3V-LDH is characteristic of steady dual reactive sites with the presence of a strong metal-support interaction (i.e., Ru and Ni sites) for individual catalysis in water splitting and is revealed to be termed as a real bifunctional electrocatalyst.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.1c08890
Theoretical screening of highly efficient single-atom catalysts for nitrogen reduction based on a defective C3N monolayer,"© 2021Conversion of N2 to NH3 through electrochemical technology is one of the most attractive and promising alternatives to the traditional Haber-Bosch method. However, exploring the promising electrocatalysts with high stability, activity and selectivity for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is still an important and long-standing challenge to accelerate the green production of NH3. Herein, through the first-principles high-throughput screening, we systematically investigated the potentiality of single transition metal (TM) anchored on defective C3N monolayer as TM-VCC candidates for N2 fixation. We carried out a comprehensive screening and systematical evaluation for stability, catalytic activity and selectivity toward NRR on TM-VCC candidates. Our results reveal that, among 26 candidates, Mn-VCC can significantly suppress HER and exhibit the outstanding NRR activity, with the most favorable limiting potential of −0.75 V through the distal pathway, which is better than the currently stepped catalyst Ru (0001). More impressively, such a satisfactory NH3 conversion is primarily ascribed to the strong back-donation interactions between d-electrons of Mn atom and the anti-orbitals of N2 molecule, as well as efficient charge transfer of electrochemical process. Our findings not only broaden the development prospect of SACs for N2 reduction but also pave a way for rational design and rapid screening of highly active C3N-based catalysts for NRR.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.165
Toward an Understanding of the Reversible Li-CO2Batteries over Metal-N4-Functionalized Graphene Electrocatalysts,"© The lack of low-cost catalysts with high activity leads to the unsatisfactory electrochemical performance of Li-CO2 batteries. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with metal-Nx moieties have great potential to improve battery reaction kinetics and cycling ability. However, how to rationally select and develop highly efficient electrocatalysts remains unclear. Herein, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to screen SACs on N-doped graphene (SAMe@NG, Me = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) for CO2 reduction and evolution reaction. Among them, SACr@NG shows the promising potential as an effective electrocatalyst for the reversible Li-CO2 batteries. To verify the validity of the DFT calculations, a two-step method has been developed to fabricate SAMe@NG on a porous carbon foam (SAMe@NG/PCF) with similar loading of ∼8 wt %. Consistent with the theoretical calculations, batteries with the SACr@NG/PCF cathodes exhibit a superior rate performance and cycling ability, with a long cycle life and a narrow voltage gap of 1.39 V over 350 cycles at a rate of 100 μA cm-2.

Impact of Nickel Content on the Structure and Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Performance of Nickel–Nitrogen–Carbon Catalysts Derived from Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyThe electrochemical conversion of CO2 affords a sustainable route to produce chemicals and fuels from renewable sources of electricity. Nickel–nitrogen–carbon (Ni–N–C) materials have shown promise in terms of activity and selectivity toward the electro-conversion of CO2 into CO, a feedstock widely used in the chemical sector. Ni–N–C catalysts, postulated to comprise catalytically active atomically dispersed Ni–Nx/C sites, are commonly prepared by pyrolyzing a mixture of transition metal-, nitrogen-, and carbon-containing precursors. Herein, we use a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8)─a subclass of metal organic frameworks─as a platform for synthesizing Ni–N–C electrocatalysts. We systematically investigate the role of the Ni concentration impregnated into the ZIF-8 precursor structure during synthesis in the overall structure and performance of the resulting Ni–N–C catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Our findings show that increased Ni contents in the catalyst precursor results in the formation of Ni-containing particles that increase the catalytic selectivity toward the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, whereas reduced Ni contents preferentially form atomically dispersed Ni–Nx/C active sites dispersed in heterogeneous carbon structures consisting of carbon nanotubes and carbonaceous particles. As an optimized concentration of Ni in the precursor mixture, we demonstrate a CO2 reduction selectivity toward CO of ca. 99% Faradaic efficiency at an applied potential of −0.68 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.1c02522
Graphene supported single metal atom catalysts for the efficient hydrogen oxidation reaction in alkaline media,"© The Royal Society of ChemistryThe sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) results in an ultra-high Pt loading on the anode of alkaline fuel cell (AFC) systems. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) can maximize the atom utilization efficiency, thus offering a promising strategy for reducing the cost of electrode materials. In this work, we systematically explored the alkaline HOR performance of single noble metal and 3d transition metal atoms anchored on the divacancy graphene (M/G, M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt) by first-principles density functional theory calculations. The calculations suggested that the alkaline HOR on M/Gs proceeds through the Heyrovsky–Volmer mechanism with the Heyrovsky reaction as the rate-determining step. Both the full free energy profile and H adsorption free energy indicate that all considered M/Gs show superb HOR activity in the order Cr/G < Fe/G < Co/G < Ni/G < Mn/G < Pt/G. However, only Pt/G and Ni/G can maintain high electrochemical stability at the HOR operating potentials, while Mn/G, Cr/G, Fe/G, and Co/G easily suffer from oxidation. Therefore, both Pt/G and Ni/G SACs are promising candidates as anodic HOR electrocatalysts for AFCs.",Catalysis Science and Technology,10.1039/d1cy01959g
Single-Atom and Bimetallic Nanoalloy Supported on Nanotubes as a Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Ultrahigh-Current-Density Overall Water Splitting,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyDeveloping exceedingly efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly bifunctional catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) especially at high current density is crucial for realizing the industrial application of electrocatalytic overall water splitting. In this work, non-noble-metal bifunctional catalysts with single Ni atoms, single Fe atoms, and NiFe nanoalloys supported on carbon nanotubes (NiSAFeSA-NixFe/CNT) are rationally designed and fabricated. In 1 M KOH, the optimized NiSAFeSA-Ni50Fe/CNT catalyst affords low overpotentials of 64 and 227 mV at 10 mA cm–2 for catalyzing the HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, the catalyst enables the overall water splitting at a low cell voltage of 1.49 V to achieve 10 mA cm–2 in 1 M KOH. At a cell voltage of 1.80 V, the current density is as high as 382 mA cm–2, which surpasses those of most materials reported so far. After a simple two-step oxidation and rereduction procedure, the catalytic performances of the OER, HER, and overall water splitting recover completely to their original levels. This work not only provides a potential catalyst candidate for economically realizing water splitting but also shows a method for reactivatable catalyst design.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.1c04454

The CH4 FE of our catalyst remains above 70 % within a wide potential range and achieves an unprecedented turnover frequency (TOF) of 16.3 s−1. The σ donation of NHC enriches the surface electron density of Cu SAS and promotes the preferential adsorption of CHO* intermediates.

Herein, we report an efficient and stable catalyst comprising a Co single atom incorporated in an RuO2 sphere for HER and OER, in which the Co single atom in the RuO2 sphere was confirmed by XAS, AC-STEM, and DFT. This tailoring strategy uses a Co single atom to modify the electronic structures of the surrounding Ru atoms and thereby remarkably elevates the electrocatalytic activities. The catalyst requires ultralow overpotentials, 45 mV for HER and 200 mV for OER, to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The theoretical calculations reveal that the energy barriers for HER and OER are lowered after incorporation of a cobalt single atom.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202114951
Boosting Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction on Atomically Dispersed Nickel Catalyst,"Copyright © 2022 Hao, Liu, Deng and Zhong.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with metal–nitrogen (M–N) sites are one of the most promising electrocatalysts for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (ECO2R). However, challenges in simultaneously enhancing the activity and selectivity greatly limit the efficiency of ECO2R due to the improper interaction of reactants/intermediates on these catalytic sites. Herein, we report a carbon-based nickel (Ni) cluster catalyst containing both single-atom and cluster sites (NiNx-T, T = 500–800) through a ligand-mediated method and realize a highly active and selective electrocatalytic CO2R process. The catalytic performance can be regulated by the dispersion of Ni–N species via controlling the pyrolysis condition. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of pyrrolic-nitrogen coordinated Ni single-atom and cluster sites, NiNx-600 exhibits a satisfying catalytic performance, including a high partial current density of 61.85 mA cm−2 and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 7,291 h−1 at −1.2 V vs. RHE, and almost 100% selectivity toward carbon monoxide (CO) production, as well as good stability under 10 h of continuous electrolysis.

Ambient Electrochemical Nitrogen Fixation over a Bifunctional Mo–(O–C2)4 Site Catalyst,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyThe electrochemical synthesis of NH3 and NO3– by the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) and the N2 oxidation reaction (NOR) under ambient conditions utilizing H2O as the hydrogen and oxygen source has aroused great attention. Here, we report the fabrication of oxygen-coordinated molybdenum (Mo) single atoms anchored on carbon (Mo–O–C) using bacterial cellulose (BC) as the impregnation regulator and carbon source. As a result, the as-synthesized Mo–O–C as an electrocatalyst exhibits superior bifunctional NRR and NOR activities with high stability. A superb NH3 yield rate of 248.6 ± 12.9 μg h–1 mgcat.–1 and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 43.8 ± 2.3% can be obtained at −0.20 V (vs RHE) by the Mo–O–C-catalyzed NRR, and Mo–O–C can also afford a NO3– yield rate of 217.1 ± 13.5 μg h–1 mgcat.–1 with a FE of 7.8 ± 0.5% at 2.35 V (vs RHE) for the NOR. The synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectra and theoretical calculation results unveil that the O-coordinated molybdenum configuration of Mo–(O–C2)4 anchored on carbon is the most stable single-atom structure as the catalytic active sites for N2 adsorption, activation, and bifunctional hydrogenation/oxidation reactions.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c10039
Boosting the ORR performance of Fe-N/C catalyst via increasing the density and modifying the electronic structure of Fe-NX active sites,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdDue to the existence of highly active Fe-NX coordination moieties, iron-nitrogen/carbon (Fe-N/C) materials have been considered as potential electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Increasing the density of Fe-NX sites is supposed to be a useful strategy to enhance the ORR performance of Fe-N/C catalysts. Herein, we report a stepwise synthesis strategy to construct Fe-N/C catalyst possessing a high ratio of mesopores and a high concentration of accessible Fe-NX active sites. Integrated with the properties of composition and morphology, the synthesized catalyst, Fe-N/C‑meso-evap, achieves remarkable ORR activity with a half potential of 0.835 V and a kinetic current density of 31.02 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V in 0.1 M HClO4.

Atomic Co decorated free-standing graphene electrode assembly for efficient hydrogen peroxide production in acid,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acids via a selective 2e− pathway offers great opportunities for electrosynthesis of H2O2, allowing on-site environmental treatment in industry. Unfortunately, despite some progress, the apparent activity of most electrocatalysts (especially in a flow cell reactor) still requires further improvement to meet the industrial demands, where high H2O2 productivity with low energy input is desired. Herein, we report a free-standing ORR electrode comprising cobalt single atoms on a vertically aligned graphene nanosheet assembly (CoN4/VG), which is demonstrated to exhibit a hierarchical porous structure maximizing the utilization of catalytic active atoms without sacrificing the mass/charge transport efficiencies. Within a H-cell setup, the as-prepared ORR electrode gives a H2O2 selectivity close to 100% from 0.3 to 0.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 M HClO4, sustaining a record-breaking H2O2 productivity of 706 mmolH2O2 gcatalyst−1 h−1 at 0.3 V vs. RHE for 36 hours. Further employing this electrode in a gas-diffusion flow reactor yields a peroxide concentration of 1100 mg L−1 (4000 mmolH2O2 gcatalyst−1 h−1) continuously at −1.8 V of cell voltage, corresponding to an energy consumption of 3.81 W h gH2O2−1, which represents the most energy-efficient flow system for rapid H2O2 generation in acidic media.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/d1ee02884g
Boosting CO desorption on dual active site electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to produce tunable syngas,"© 2021 The Author(s)The electrochemical conversion of CO2 to generate syngas (H2 and CO) is regarded as a promising alternative technique to facilitate CO2 reduction in the ambient atmosphere. However, it is still a great challenge to acquire high catalytic activity with an adjustable H2/CO ratio over a wide range. Here, we construct an electrocatalyst with Fe-containing dual active sites on N-doped porous carbon (Fe/FeN4C) to promote a CO2 reduction reaction for tunable syngas production. The Fe/FeN4C catalysts have a positive onset potential (−0.18 VRHE), approximately 100% of the sum of the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO and H2, a high total current density (>39.33 mA cm−2), and a wide H2/CO ratio (1.09∼7.08). Density functional-theory calculations suggest that the Fe single atoms dispersed into the N-doped carbon structure, along with the incorporation of Fe nanoparticles, may decrease the adsorption energy of ∗CO, thus synergistically enhancing the catalytic activity.",Cell Reports Physical Science,10.1016/j.xcrp.2021.100703

First principles study of single Fe atom supported on TiO2(0 0 1) for nitrogen reduction to ammonia,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In great contrast to energy-extensive Haber-Bosch process, electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction offers green and sustainable ammonia production at ambient reaction conditions. Among them, the demand for low-consumption and high-performance non-noble-metal catalysts is still a hot spot in the field of electrocatalysts. Herein, we demonstrate that single Fe atom loaded on anatase TiO2(0 0 1) shows well-balanced activity for N2 fixation and NH3 dissociation. In addition, it is active to catalyze nitrogen reductions with the initial hydrogenation to the distal N as the potential-determining step (1.27 eV). Considering that TiO2 is a model photocatalyst, single Fe atom can promote electron-hole separation to enhance the photocatalytic performance. Thus, Fe/TiO2(0 0 1) has been identified as a potential catalyst for photo-electrochemical ammonia synthesis.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151417
Engineering dual metal single-atom sites with the nitrogen-coordinated nonprecious catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic electrolyte,"© 2021An electrocatalyst composed of dual metal single-atom sites attached to nitrogen-doped porous carbon was made in the current study developing a host–guest design. Co single atoms/nitrogen-doped carbon (Co SAs/NC), Fe SAs/NC, and Co-Fe SAs/NC electrocatalysts were successfully synthesized to evaluate their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR reaction activity) in an acidic medium. Co-Fe SAs/NC shown remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performances compared to other samples due to the porous structures from their N-doped porous carbon and dual-site of Fe-Zn or Co-Fe. The respective onset potential and the limiting current density values for Co-Fe SAs/NC are 0.86 VRHE and 6.34 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M HClO4. In contrast with commercial 10 wt% Pt/C, the Co-Fe SAs/NC possess a small electrochemical impedance. It is worth noting that 90.31% and 73.24 % of the initial current density of Co-Fe SAs/NC are remained after 15,000 and 40,000 s in durability measurements. Besides, after 40k durability cycles, the Co-Fe SAs/NC was more stable than commercial Pt/C. Therefore, the Co-Fe SAs/NC can be considered an encouraging ORR catalyst to be utilized in fuel cells to address the problems associated with slow ORR kinetics and high durability.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151367
First principle investigation of W/P3C sheet as an efficient single atom electrocatalyst for N2 and NO electrochemical reaction with suppressed hydrogen evolution,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdElectrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (eNRR) and NO electroreduction reaction (NOER) are considered as the effective methods to synthesize NH3 under ambient conditions. Based on density functional theory, a series of transition metal atoms supported P3C sheet is systematically investigated to screen out the most promising catalyst for eNRR and NOER. The results indicate that the W/P3C could be an efficient single atom catalyst for eNRR and NOER with the limit potentials of −0.70 and −0.59 V respectively. Remarkably, W/P3C is more conducive to eNRR and NOER than hydrogen evolution reaction. It can be concluded that the local geometric and electronic structure are altered due to the interaction between metal and support, which could promote eNRR and NOER. We hope this work could provide promising method to design the effective electrocatalyst.",Fuel,10.1016/j.fuel.2021.122068
Computational screening of single-atom alloys TM@Ru(0001) for enhanced electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Searching for highly efficient, active, and stable electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction is vital to supersede the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is one of the most promising strategies to synthesize value-added ammonia (NH3) under mild conditions with low energy utilization and less greenhouse gas emission. However, the lack of effective electrocatalysts remains the major hurdle for its practical applications. Ruthenium is generally considered a promising electrocatalyst for the electrochemical NRR. However, it exhibits a high overpotential corresponding to the potential determining step in the reduction pathway. Herein, using density functional theory, we systematically investigated the potential of a series of transition metal-doped Ru-based TM@Ru(0001) (TM = Sc-Zn, Y-Cd) single-atom alloys to evaluate their NRR activity. Among all the studied catalysts, it was found that the V doped Ru(0001) SAA exhibited a reduced kinetic barrier of about 1.14 eV as compared to that of the pure Ru(0001) corresponding to the potential determining step (PDS). In addition, it showed a significantly low negative limiting potential of −0.15 V for the PDS along with thermodynamical stability and high selectivity over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Climbing-Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-NEB) method was employed to calculate the barrier height between various hydrogenation steps of the reduction reaction followed by the calculation of turnover frequency (TOF) for V@Ru(0001) using a microkinetic modelling approach. The TOF for V@Ru(0001) was found to be 4.24 × 10−3 per s per site at 100 bar and 700 K, which is far better than that of the pure Ru(0001) surface. This report provides a new design strategy to improve the catalytic performance of Ru(0001) for effective NRR.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta08246a
Edge Effect Promotes Graphene-Confining Single-Atom Co–N4 and Rh–N4 for Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyDesigning bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) holds a central position for performance improvement in reversible oxygen/water redox cell systems. Herein, taking the graphene-confining single-atom M–N4 motif as an example, we explored the effect of a graphene edge (armchair and zigzag configurations) on their bifunctional ORR and OER activities. It is clarified that the symmetry breaking of the M–N4 motif around the edge has a potential influence on the intermediates’ adsorption and thermodynamic pictures. Based on the evaluation of the electrochemical step symmetry index (ESSI) and bifunctional index (BI), Co–N4 and Rh–N4 motifs at the armchair edge with BIs of 0.49 and 0.61 V are predicted as optimal bifunctional catalytic sites for the ORR/OER due to the d-band modulation from the edge environment. Our results unfold the effect of the graphene edge on the oxygen-involving electrocatalytic mechanism and provide a clear theoretical guidance for the design of bifunctional oxygen electrode materials in reversible fuel cells, electrolyzers, and rechargeable metal–air batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c07691
Rational Construction of Atomically Dispersed Mn-NxEmbedded in Mesoporous N-Doped Amorphous Carbon for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Zn-Air Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Efficient single-atom transition metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) electrocatalysts are one of the most prospective alternatives to platinum-group metal (PGM)-based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the renewable energy area. However, their large scale application is quite challenging due to the lack of facile and cost-efficient synthetic strategies. Here, an atomically dispersed Mn-Nx on mesoporous N-doped amorphous carbon (MnNC) was engineered through pyrolyzing the Mn-Nx-containing complex generated by the reaction between Mn ions and phenanthroline. Owing to the atomically dispersed Mn-Nx moieties on the large mesoprous amorphous carbon, the resulting MnNC presents superb ORR performance evidenced by the half-wave potential of 0.86 V and the slight decay after long-time chronoamperometry tests, which surpasses commercial Pt/C and most reported Mn-based catalysts. Furthermore, the MnNC-based Zn-air battery delivers excellent performance, including a peak power density of 130.0 mW cm-2 and a specific capacity of 819.0 mAh gZn-1 as well as prominent durability that could continuously discharge for 60 h. This facile and scalable preparation approach provides a novel single-atom design direction for the architecture of high-performance ORR catalysts.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c05882
Tailoring the Electronic Structure of an Atomically Dispersed Zinc Electrocatalyst: Coordination Environment Regulation for High Selectivity Oxygen Reduction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHAccurately regulating the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial to renewable energy storage and utilization, but challenging. A flexible alteration of ORR pathways on atomically dispersed Zn sites towards high selectivity ORR can be achieved by tailoring the coordination environment of the catalytic centers. The atomically dispersed Zn catalysts with unique O- and C-coordination structure (ZnO3C) or N-coordination structure (ZnN4) can be prepared by varying the functional groups of corresponding MOF precursors. The coordination environment of as-prepared atomically dispersed Zn catalysts was confirmed by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFs). Notably, the ZnN4 catalyst processes a 4 e− ORR pathway to generate H2O. However, controllably tailoring the coordination environment of atomically dispersed Zn sites, ZnO3C catalyst processes a 2 e− ORR pathway to generate H2O2 with a near zero overpotential and high selectivity in 0.1 M KOH. Calculations reveal that decreased electron density around Zn in ZnO3C lowers the d-band center of Zn, thus changing the intermediate adsorption and contributing to the high selectivity towards 2 e− ORR.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202110838
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction directed through the p-band center of boron on BSAC@Mo2C,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Greener modes of ammonia synthesis via the electrocatalytic route have been investigated on pristine and defective Mo2C based monolayers anchored with metal-free boron atom catalysts. Boron single atom catalysts (SACs) on the defective Mo2C monolayer has been found to activate N2 strongly with an adsorption energy of-1.92 eV and reduce it to NH3 efficiently with a significantly low overpotential of 0.41 eV. The exothermic adsorption of N2 and low overpotential for the nitrogen reduction reduction (NRR) appertain to the p-band center of the boron atom catalyst and charge transfer between the adsorbed N2 and the catalyst, respectively. This work brings forth the correlation between electron occupancy on the boron center and NRR catalytic efficiency on a metal-free SACs@Mo2C monolayer couple, thereby serving as a lead in designing metal free electrocatalysts for the NRR.",Materials Advances,10.1039/d1ma00953b
"Tantalum based single, double, and triple atom catalysts supported on g-C2N monolayer for effective nitrogen reduction reaction: a comparative DFT investigation","This journal is © The Royal Society of ChemistryDesign of efficient and low cost electrocatalysts for the reduction of N2 molecule to NH3 in a green manner remains a great challenge in the 21st century. Herein, we have used density functional theory based first principle simulations to systematically investigate the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) ability of single, double, and triple Ta-atom catalysts anchored to C2N monolayer. Our results demonstrate that the single and triple Ta-atom catalysts anchored to C2N monolayer act as superior catalysts for the NRR via alternating and distal pathways as compared to the Ru(0001) stepped surface. In particular, the triple Ta-atom catalyst anchored to C2N shows enhanced NRR performance with a limiting potential of −0.72 V which is comparable to the experimentally reported Ru based single atom catalyst. Further, all the three catalysts were found to be highly selective for NRR with an enhanced ability to suppress the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Electronic structure analysis revealed that the enhanced ability of Ta3@C2N catalyst to effectively capture and reduce N2 molecule could be attributed to the built up of localized d states near the fermi level, thereby aiding in strong electron transfer into the antibonding orbitals of N2. Thus, our findings propose a highly active catalyst for the NRR with an emphasis on the importance of triple atom-based catalysts for electrocatalytic applications.",Catalysis Science and Technology,10.1039/d1cy01292d
Cobalt single-atom-decorated nickel thiophosphate nanosheets for overall water splitting,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Formidable challenges in the development of efficient single-atom catalysts including accessible fabrication processes, unambiguous interactions with matrixes, and accelerated kinetics of catalytic mechanisms, pose an obstacle in maximizing the catalytic performance. Herein, it is proposed, for the first time, to bond single-atom Co on the surface of single-layered nickel thiophosphate (SA Co NiPS3) forming a uniform unsaturated coordination mode of isolated Co. Theoretical studies indicate that the SA Co NiPS3electrode possesses a higher intrinsic activity than that of traditional Co alternative-doped NiPS3viathe enhancement of conductivity and the reduction of energy barriers for bifunctional hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HERs/OERs). Notably, a water splitting electrolyzer assembled using SA Co NiPS3nanosheets as both the cathode and the anode achieves 50 mA cm−2at 1.60 V, which outperforms the Pt/C//RuO2benchmark (1.74 V@50 mA cm−2). Besides, this electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding durability up to 6 days with negligible decay. This work shines fresh light on igniting 2D metal thiophosphate electrocatalytic activity that even surpasses noble-metal-based electrocatalystsviathe single-atom engineering.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta08599a
Boron Coordination Effect in Ni−Nx Doped Graphene Catalysts on the ORR Performance Based on DFT Calculations,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe coordination atoms of metal active site in transition metal N-doped carbon single atom electrocatalysts play a vital role in dominating the catalytic performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode of fuel cells or metal-air cells. In view of weak adsorption ability of Ni active site in NiN4−C catalysts to oxygen intermediate states, herein we introduce boron atoms with smaller electronegativity than N and C atoms to modulate the local coordination environment and electronic structures of Ni site. First-principles density functional calculations reveal that both B substitution for N atoms (NiN2B2−C) and B coordinating with N and C (NiN4B8−C) can effectively optimize the Gibbs free energy of oxygen intermediate states and hence improve the catalytic activity of the materials. In addition, we propose that the trend change in catalytic activity is mainly governed by the filling of antibonding orbitals between Ni-3d and O-2p states near the Fermi level.",ChemPhysChem,10.1002/cphc.202100692
Tuning d Orbital of Ni Single Atom by Encapsulating Ni Nanoparticle in Carbon Nanotube for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Single atom catalysts (SACs) have received considerable attention due to their high-atomic-utilization efficiency and tunable activity and selectivity. Here, in combination of experiments and calculations, we demonstrated that the electronic structures and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the confined Ni SAC in a nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube are modulated by the encapsulated Ni nanoparticle (Ni@NiNCNT). The synergistic interaction between Ni SAC and Ni nanoparticle endows the Ni@NiNCNT with a satisfactory OER performance of 358 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2 current density and a Tafel slope of 89 mV dec-1, superior to the control samples and commercial RuO2. In addition, when employed as an air-cathode catalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs), a Ni@NiNCNT modified battery outperformed a Pt/C+RuO2 modified battery, with a higher power density and superior constant current charge-discharge cycle stability for 40 h. Theoretical simulations further revealed that the Ni nanoparticle can remarkably optimize the adsorption strength of oxygen atom on Ni SAC, leading to a small overpotential of 0.22 V for the rate-limiting step of*O formation. Furthermore, the charge transfer from Ni nanoparticle to Ni SAC, which handles Ni-d orbital characters of Ni SAC and accordingly the adsorption strength toward oxygenates, is responsible for the origin of the OER activity. Our results provide a new way to tune electronic structures of the SAC and thus to tune its catalytic activity and should be insightful for designing new type electrocatalysts based on SAC.",Energy and Fuels,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c02644
Atomically Interfacial Engineering on Molybdenum Nitride Quantum Dots Decorated N-doped Graphene for High-Rate and Stable Alkaline Hydrogen Production,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.The development of low-cost, high-efficiency, and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline conditions is a key challenge in water electrolysis. Here, an interfacial engineering strategy that is capable of simultaneously regulating nanoscale structure, electronic structure, and interfacial structure of Mo2N quantum dots decorated on conductive N-doped graphene via codoping single-atom Al and O (denoted as AlO@Mo2N-NrGO) is reported. The conversion of Anderson polyoxometalates anion cluster ([AlMo6O24H6]3−, denoted as AlMo6) to Mo2N quantum dots not only result in the generation of more exposed active sites but also in situ codoping atomically dispersed Al and O, that can fine-tune the electronic structure of Mo2N. It is also identified that the surface reconstruction of Al-OH hydrates in AlO@Mo2N quantum dots plays an essential role in enhancing hydrophilicity and lowering the energy barriers for water dissociation and hydrogen desorption, resulting in a remarkable alkaline HER performance, even better than the commercial 20% Pt/C. Moreover, the strong interfacial interaction (Mo-N bonds) between AlO@Mo2N and N-doped graphene can significantly improve electron transfer efficiency and interfacial stability. As a result, outstanding stability over 300 h at a current density higher than 100 mA cm−2 is achieved, demonstrating great potential for the practical application of this catalyst.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.202204949
Screening of the Transition Metal Single Atom Anchored on α-Borophene Catalysts as a Feasible Strategy for Electrosynthesis of Urea,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Theoretical study of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and N2 reduction reaction synergistic synthesis of urea via C-N bond coupling, which has provided a high-efficiency approach to developing renewable energy conversion and storage, could also play a significant role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. However, the practical design and development of electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for urea exhibits remain many challenges. Herein, building up a screening strategy based on density functional theory calculations on the transition metal single atom anchored on α-borophene nanosheets provided a route for systematically exploring catalytic activity and electronic properties of the catalyst during CO2 and N2 electroreduction. M@α-B (Ti, Cr, Nb, Mo, and Ta) exhibits promising catalytic activity and selectivity toward the production of urea with the working potentials of -0.31, -0.16, -0.32, and -0.31 V, respectively, during the electrochemical reaction process. Furthermore, the superior activity is closely related to the d-band center and the charge density transfer of active center atoms. To gain insights into the intrinsic correlation between the binding and structural properties, the d-band center position of these M@α-B materials and the limiting potential are used to estimate the catalytic activity of catalysts. Thus, a volcano plot has established a base on the limiting potential with the d-band center positions, and a new descriptor (φ) is suggested to gain insights into the intrinsic correlation from the viewpoint of atomic properties, which involves the electronegativity and the number of d orbital electrons (Nd) of metal atoms. Therefore, a moderate limiting potential (-0.4 < UL < 0 V) and d-band center (-0.2 < ?d < 0.8 eV) lead to high catalytic activity and both thermodynamic and electronic properties of materials. The theoretical landscape for screening M@α-B toward CO2 and N2 conversion into urea will provide a practical approach to gaining insights into the electrochemical reaction mechanism for urea synthesis. It also motivates the experimental efforts to explore the electrocatalysts for other electrochemical reactions.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1021/acs.chemmater.2c01572
Atomically dispersed palladium supported on nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon for drastic electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCThe electrocatalysis of water to hydrogen is expected to play an essential and significant role in the development of future electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, together with the exploration of green energy. However, the high cost of noble metal catalysts remains a key challenge and it still requires further investigations to fabricate high mass activity and stable electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a facile and economical approach to achieve atomically dispersed palladium on the nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon matrix (Pd1/NMC) as the electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution, which exhibits an overpotential of 37 and 118 mV at the current density of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, superior to the commercial platinum/carbon (Pt/C) and palladium/carbon (Pd/C) catalysts. Moreover, the mass activity of the Pd1/NMC catalyst surpasses that of Pt/C and Pd/C at 100 mV versus RHE in HER. Systematic characterizations demonstrate that the Pd atoms are atomically dispersed on the surface of NMC and stabilized by active nitrogen sites, inducing the isolated Pd atoms to form a favorable bivalent oxidation state. This method provides an atomic-level insights into preparing superior single-atom catalysts for energy-related applications and devices.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.09.118
Electrocatalytic enhancement mechanism of cobalt single atoms anchored on different MXene substrates in oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions,"© 2022 The Authors. EcoMat published by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Decorating single atoms of transition metals on MXenes to enhance the electrocatalytic properties of the resulting composites is a useful strategy for developing efficient electrocatalysts, and the mechanisms behind this enhancement are under intense scrutiny. Herein, we anchored Co single atoms onto several commonly used MXene substrates (V2CTx, Nb2CTx and Ti3C2Tx) and systematically studied the electrocatalytic behavior and the mechanisms of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively) of the resulting composites. Co@V2CTx composite displays an OER overpotential of 242 mV and an HER overpotential of 35 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, which is much lower than for Co@Nb2CTx and Co@Ti3C2Tx, making it comparable to the commercial noble metal Pt/C and RuO2/C electrocatalysts. The experimental and theoretical results point out that the enhanced bifunctional catalytic performance of Co@V2CTx benefits from the stronger hybridization between Co 3d and surface terminated O 2p orbitals which optimized the electronic structure of Co single atoms in the composite. This, in turn, results in lowering the OER and HER energy barriers and acceleration of the catalytic kinetics in case of the Co@V2CTx composite. The advantage of Co@V2CTx was further validated by its high overall water splitting performance (1.60 V to deliver 10 mA cm−2). Our study sheds light on the origins of the catalytic activity of single transition metals atoms on MXene substrates, and provides guidelines for designing efficient bifunctional MXene-based electrocatalysts.

Single atomic Fe-pyridine N catalyst with dense active sites improve bifunctional electrocatalyst activity for rechargeable and flexible Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The iron-pyridinic-N moiety is considered more active for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, low active site density and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity hinder the further improvement of Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, the macromolecules of the different nitrogen sites have been rationally designed and fabricated to create a carbon material with a high content of pyridine N. On this basis, the activated carbon matrix allows the halfway reduction of Fe3+ to Fex+, which is coordinated with pyridinic N to form a high-loading Fe-pyridinic N bonding structure. It also stimulates the complete reduction of Fe3+ to a single Fe atom on a 3D sponge carbon structure (named Fe/Fe-NC-3). Benefiting from pyridine N, the Fe-pyridinic N-bonding structure, single atom dispersion, and hierarchical pore channels, the Fe/Fe-NC-3 shows superior ORR and OER electrochemical activity, approaching that of the commercial Pt/C and IrO2. In addition, Fe/Fe-NC-3 as a ZAB air-electrode exhibits outstanding stability for over 500 h and a remarkable power density of 304.4 mW cm−2 in reversible ZABs. Moreover, the flexible ZABs deliver a high open-circuit voltage of 1.35 V, stable voltage gap under flat/bent states, and discharge voltage at 2 mA cm−2.

Electro-assisted Molecular Assembly Giving Atomic-Scale Catalytic Active-Site Detection,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The artificially accurate design of nonmetal electrocatalysts’ active site has been a huge challenge because no pure active species with the specific structure could be strictly controlled by traditional synthetic methods. Species with a multiconfiguration in the catalyst hinder identification of the active site and the subsequent comprehension of the reaction mechanism. We have developed a novel electro-assisted molecular assembly strategy to obtain a pure pentagon ring on perfect graphene avoiding other reconstructed structures. More importantly, the active atom was confirmed by the subtle passivation process as the topmost carbon atom. Recognition of the carbon-defect electrocatalysis reaction mechanism was first downsized to the single-atom scale from the experimental perspective. It is expected that this innovative electro-assisted molecular assembly strategy could be extensively applied in the active structure-controlled synthesis of nonmetal electrocatalysts and verification of the exact active atom.",Chemistry - A European Journal,10.1002/chem.202202700

Herein, a promising approach is outlined for the rational design of multimetallic catalysts comprising multiple active sites including Pd nanoclusters and Ru single atoms anchored at the defective sites of Ni(OH)2 to simultaneously enhance hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and ethanol oxidation reactions (EOR). Remarkably, Pd12Ru3/Ni(OH)2/C exhibits a remarkably reduced HER overpotential (16.1 mV@10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 21.8 mV dec−1) as compared to commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C (26.0 mV@10 mA cm−2, 32.5 mV dec−1). More importantly, Pd12Ru3/Ni(OH)2/C possesses a self-optimized overpotential to 12.5 mV@10 mA cm−2 after 20 000 cycles stability test while a significantly decreased performance for commercial 20wt.% Pt/C (64.5 mV@10 mA cm−2 after 5000 cycles). The mass activity of Pd12Ru3/Ni(OH)2/C for the EOR is up to 3.724 A mgPdRu−1, ≈20 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C. Electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared measurements confirm the enhanced CO2 selectivity of Pd12Ru3/Ni(OH)2/C while synergistic and electronic effects of adjacent Ru, Pd, and OHad adsorption on Ni(OH)2 at low potential play a key role during EOR.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202208587
"First-Principles Investigation of the Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2on Zirconium-Based Single-, Double-, and Triple-Atom Catalysts Anchored on a Graphitic Carbon Nitride Monolayer","© 2022 American Chemical Society.Conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) with the help of an appropriate electrocatalyst with high stability, low onset potential, and exceptional selectivity is still one of the great tasks in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to valuable chemicals. Herein, by means of systematic first-principles simulations, we investigate the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) activity of zirconium-based single-, double-, and triple-atom (Zrn@C2N; n = 1-3) catalysts anchored on a graphitic carbon-nitride monolayer. In tune with the Sabatier principle, our results reveal that a moderate CO2 binding is vital for a low onset potential for the CO2RR. Consequently, based on rigorous free energy calculations, the Zr-based single-atom catalyst (SAC) is found to be most effective to convert CO2 to valuable products such as HCOOH and CH3OH. It is worth noting that CO2 reduction to HCOOH is spontaneous via the *HCOO intermediate on Zr1@C2N and involves a low onset potential of-0.23 V with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode from the *COOH intermediate. Among all the catalysts evaluated computationally, the Zr SAC further reveals the lowest onset potential of-0.89 V for CH3OH formation. The results show that the Zr-based catalysts especially Zr1@C2N are found to effectively suppress the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and promote the CO2RR. Moreover, all three catalysts exhibit high kinetic and thermal stability with negligible distortion due to which their structures can be retained very well up to 600 K. Thus, the current work may provide effective catalyst-design strategies for enhancing the electrocatalytic CO2RR performance of Zr-based materials.",ACS Applied Nano Materials,10.1021/acsanm.2c03464
Nitrogen Balance on Ni–N–C Promotor for High-Energy Lithium-Sulfur Pouch Cells,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.The viability of lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries toward real implementation directly correlates with unlocking lithium polysulfide (LiPS) evolution reactions. Along this line, designing promotors with the function of synchronously relieving LiPS shuttle and promoting sulfur conversion is critical. Herein, the nitrogen evolution on hierarchical and atomistic Ni–N–C electrocatalyst, mainly pertaining to the essential subtraction, reservation and coordination of nitrogen atoms, is manipulated to attain favorable Li–S pouch cell performances. Such rational evolution behavior realizes the “nitrogen balance” in simultaneously regulating the Ni–N coordination environment, Ni single atom loading, abundant vacancy defects, active nitrogen and electron conductivity, and maximizing the electrocatalytic activity elevation of Ni–N–C system. With such merit, the cathode harvests favorable performances in a soft-packaged pouch cell prototype even under high sulfur mass loading and lean electrolyte usage. A specific energy density up to 405.1 Wh kg−1 is harvested by the 0.5-Ah-level pouch cell.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.202204027
Spatial Relation Controllable Di-Defects Synergy Boosts Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction over VSe2 Nanoflakes in All pH Electrolytes,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Defect engineering of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is important for improving electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. Herein, a facile and scalable atomic-level di-defect strategy over thermodynamically stable VSe2 nanoflakes, yielding attractive improvements in the electrocatalytic HER performance over a wide electrolyte pH range is reported. The di-defect configuration with controllable spatial relation between single-atom (SA) V defects and single Se vacancy defects effectively triggers the electrocatalytic HER activity of the inert VSe2 basal plane. When employed as a cathode, this di-defects decorated VSe2 electrocatalyst requires overpotentials of 67.2, 72.3, and 122.3 mV to reach a HER current density of 10 mA cm−2 under acidic, alkaline, and neutral conditions, respectively, which are superior to most previously reported non-noble metal HER electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the reactive microenvironment consists of two adjacent SA Mo atoms with two surrounding symmetric Se vacancies, yielding optimal water dissociation and hydrogen desorption kinetics. This study provides a scalable strategy for improving the electrocatalytic activity of other TMDCs with inert atoms in the basal plane.",Small,10.1002/smll.202204557
Binary Metal Single Atom Electrocatalysts with Synergistic Catalytic Activity toward High-Rate and High Areal-Capacity Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries with high theoretical energy density have been long considered as an alternative energy storage device to lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the polysulfide shuttle effects trigger fast capacity decay and short battery lifespan, severely hampering their practical utilizations. Herein, an efficient electrocatalyst comprising of nitrogen (N)-coordinated binary metal single atoms (SAs) implanted within a hierarchical porous carbon skeleton (Fe/Co-N-HPC) is constructed to trap and catalyze polysulfides conversion through a separator coating strategy. It is demonstrated that the introduction of Co atom can enrich the electron number of Fe active center, thereby realizing the distinct synergistic catalytic effect of binary metal SAs and improving the bidirectional catalysis of Li–S redox reaction. As a result, Li–S batteries with the Fe/Co-N-HPC-modified separator exhibit outstanding rate capability (740 mAh g−1 at 5.0 C), and superior long-term cyclic stability (694 mAh g−1 after 600 cycles at 1.0 C). Increasing the sulfur loading to 4.8 mg cm−2, a remarkable areal capacity of 6.13 mAh cm−2 is achieved. Furthermore, in situ X-ray diffraction and theoretical simulation results verify the catalysis mechanism of binary metal SAs by changing the rate-determining steps, providing new directions for constructing high-performance Li–S batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202208666
Novel (Pt-Ox)-(Co-Oy) Nonbonding Active Structures on Defective Carbon from Oxygen-Rich Coal Tar Pitch for Efficient HER and ORR,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Atomic-scale utilization and coordination structure of Pt electrocatalyst is extremely crucial to decrease loading mass and maximize activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). A novel atomic-scale (Pt-Ox)-(Co-Oy) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters on the defective carbon derived from oxygen-rich coal tar pitch (CTP). The Pt loading mass is extremely low and only 0.56 wt%. A new nonbonding interaction phenomenon between Pt-Ox and Co-Oy is found and confirmed based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Based on the (Pt-Ox)-(Co-Oy) nonbonding active structure, surface chemical field coupling with electrocatalysis for the HER and ORR is confirmed. It is found that the (Pt-Ox)-(Co-Oy) nonbonding active structure exhibits high mass activities of 64.4 A cm−2 mgPt−1 (at an overpotential of 100 mV) and 7.2 A cm−2 mgPt−1 (at 0.8 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for the HER and ORR, respectively. The values are 6.5 and 11.6 times as much as those of commercial 20% Pt/C. The work provides innovative insight to design and understand efficient active sites of atomic-scale Pt on oxygen-rich CTP-derived carbon supports for electrocatalysis.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202206960
Nature-Inspired Design of Molybdenum–Selenium Dual-Single-Atom Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) is becoming an increasingly important technology for achieving carbon neutrality. Inspired by the structure of naturally occurring Mo-dependent enzymes capable of activating CO2, a heteronuclear Mo–Se dual-single-atom electrocatalyst (MoSA–SeSA) for ECR into CO with a Faradaic efficiency of above 90% over a broad potential window from −0.4 to −1.0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is demonstrated here. Both operando characterization and theoretical simulation results verify that MoSA acts as central atoms that directly interact with the ECR feedstock and intermediates, whereas the SeSA adjacent to MoSA modulates the electronic structure of MoSA through long-range electron delocalization for inhibiting MoSA poisoning caused by strong CO adsorption. In addition, the SeSAs far from MoSA help suppress the competing hydrogen evolution side reaction and accelerate the CO2 transport by repelling H2O. This work provides new insight into the precise regulation and in-depth understanding of multisite synergistic catalysis at the atomic scale.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202206478
"Single atom Fe-based catalyst derived from hierarchical (Fe,N)-ZIF-8/CNFs for high-efficient ORR activity","© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The development of high-efficiency, stable, and low-cost Fe-N-C electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has attracted considerable attention. Herein, a stable atomically dispersed Fe-Nx-based catalyst was synthesized from a hierarchical structure involving carbon nanofiber (CNF)-supported zeolitic-imidazolate-framework-8 (ZIF-8) encapsulated Fe-Phen complex ((Fe,N)-ZIF-8/CNFs). The Fe-Nx-CNFs obtained from the pyrolysis of (Fe,N)-ZIF-8/CNFs showed a good hierarchical multi-layer structure. The natural network structure of the carbon nanofibers serves as a matrix to uniformly distribute the ZIF-8 particles, and the Fe-Nx sites derived from the Fe-Phen complex were uniformly distributed in ZIF-8 particles. It exhibits excellent ORR performance with a high half-wave potential of 0.875 V (vs. RHE), which was 55 mV higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the catalyst further revealed the origin of the ORR activity via a 4e− pathway from the precise local coordination of FeN4 sites.",Materials Chemistry Frontiers,10.1039/d2qm00763k
Single-Atom Sn on Tensile-Strained ZnO Nanosheets for Highly Efficient Conversion of CO2 into Formate,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.In general, commercial ZnO owns the poor selectivity and activity toward electroreduction CO2 to formate. In contrast, the numbers of Sn-based nanomaterials are reported as excellent electrocatalysts for formate production, however, the metallic Sn is more expensive than Zn. In this study, it is demonstrated that an atomically dispersed Sn on a tensile-strained ZnO nanosheet (Sn SA/ZnO) shows dramatically improved activity and selectivity for formate production over a wide potential window compared with that of commercial ZnO. Especially, Sn SA/ZnO exhibits 205-fold mass activity enhancement than the commercial Sn at −1.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode normalized with element Sn. The experimental measurements combined with theoretical calculations revealed that Sn SA/ZnO can effectively capture and activate CO2 by its exposed double-active sites (Sn and O), while the tensile strain on its surface boosts the catalytic selectivity by strengthening the adsorption of the *HCOO intermediate for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202202695
The role of adsorbed hydroxide reduction in hydrogen evolution and nitrogen reduction reactions in aqueous solution,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Understanding the reaction mechanisms of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) in aqueous solution is important for securing a sustainable energy future. However, such mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. In this work, taking transition-metal (TM) single-atom catalysts supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (TMN3 or TMN4, denoted as *) for demonstration purposes, we employed density functional theory calculations to study their HER/NRR electrocatalytic activities, with H2O as a proton donor. Our calculated results suggest that TMN3/4 is likely to be oxidized by hydroxide adsorption (*OH) from H2O dissociation, leading to the formation of TM(OH)N3/4 without HER/NRR reactivity. In this regard, a particular electrode potential (U) is needed to drive *OH reduction (*OH → * + OH− − e−, denoted as *OH-red) to keep the TMN3/4 site ready for the delivery of HER/NRR activity. Therefore, *OH reduction plays a critical role in the electrocatalytic activity of HER/NRR in aqueous solution. Specifically, the limiting potential (UL) of HER is −max(ΔG*OH-red, ΔG*H)/e, while the UL of NRR is −max(ΔG*OH-red, ΔG*N2H, ΔG*NH3)/e for the NRR-*N2 mechanism and −max(ΔG*OH-red, ΔG*H, ΔG*NHNH, ΔG*NH3)/e for the NRR-*H mechanism. Our calculated results provide new insights into the chemical reaction mechanisms of HER/NRR in aqueous solution, which can promote the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta04867a
Single Atom Catalysts with Out-of-Plane Coordination Structure on Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Adjusting the local coordination environment of single-atom electrocatalysts is a viable way to improve catalytic performance. The diversity of coordination geometric structures is limited to the traditional in-plane configuration, with only a little consideration paid to out-of-plane configurations due to the lack of suitable carriers and fabrication methods. This study reports out-of-plane coordination of Co-based single-atom catalysts mediated by the conjugated bipyridine-rich covalent organic framework (COF). The bipyridine nitrogen on the COF layer backbone of these catalysts serves as the linker center for cobalt sites anchoring, while the complementary moieties are coordinated at the other side of the Co metal and reside beyond the COF backbone plane, thus yielding out-of-plane coordination. The electrochemical experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that catalysts with multiple out-of-plane coordinations exhibit different electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activities and catalytic pathways. The out-of-plane coordination enabled by COFs provides a strategy for designing single-atom electrocatalysts, expanding the application of COFs in the field of electrocatalysis.",Small,10.1002/smll.202203966

The N≡N bond can be weakened by the coordination of bimetal atoms in the presence of bimetallic sites, thus enhancing NRR activity. In this paper, we systematically studied different diatomic catalysts by density functional theory, and screened out some suitable candidate catalysts, Finally, it is concluded that FeTi@Pc catalyst has the best catalytic activity with the limiting potential of − 0.37 V and selectivity for NRR reaction. We firmly believe that this work not only open up a way for the design of other non-noble metal NRR electrocatalysts with high activity, but also provide a promising strategy for the synthesis of NRR catalysts in experiments. Graphical Abstract: We used 3d and 4d transition metal atoms to replace N atoms and Fe doped on the Phthalocyanine as the electrocatalyst for NRR. After screening and research, we found that FeTi@Pc catalyst has good catalytic activity and selectivity for NRR. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Catalysis Letters,10.1007/s10562-022-04106-z
Sustainable Synthesis of Dual Single-Atom Catalyst of Pd-N4/Cu-N4 for Partial Oxidation of Ethylene Glycol,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Catalysts assumed that properly designed bimetallic systems would provide superior catalytic performance due to the cooperative effects between two atoms. Dual single-atom catalyst (DSAC) Pd-N4/Cu-N4 is synthesized using a simple, cost-effective, and efficient electrochemical reduction method. The palladium single-atom is prepared first by electrochemical reduction of copper phthalocyanine to create defective N4 sites. The new structural feature is characterized by copper reduction from Cu-N4 coordination and the formation of defected N4 (▫M-N4) sites, which react with a Pd precursor and form Pd-N4 on the host surface. The DSAC Pd-N4/Cu-N4 technique synergistically improves electrocatalytic performance toward the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction. It possesses excellent glycolate selectivity (above 88%) in an alkaline solution with an onset oxidation potential as low as 0.6 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), compared to commercial Pd/C. The DSAC electrocatalyst is characterized by its high current density of 83.92 mA cm−2 and high faradic efficiency value (>80%) for glycolate at 1.0 VRHE. The findings suggest a promising method to synthesize the DSACs in varying transition metals to achieve highly efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly catalysts for different applications.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202206887

EcoMat published by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Single-atoms (SAs) supported on various substrates have emerged as a new form of electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The exfoliated MXenes possess rich defects/vacancies and surface oxygen groups, can be favorably utilized to anchor SAs. Here, we take advantage of the exfoliated Ti3C2Tx to anchor Ru-SAs on Ti3C2Tx through a wet-chemistry impregnation process. The obtained RuSA@Ti3C2Tx possesses excellent HER activity, especially under high current densities. Remarkably, RuSA@Ti3C2Tx can readily attain high current densities of 1 and 1.5 A cm−2 at low over potentials of 425.7 and 464.6 mV, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. The A1g vibration frequency shift of the Raman spectrum is innovatively used to probe the surface -OH coverage on Ti3C2Tx, providing critical information for mechanistic studies. The experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the superior HER electrocatalytic activity of RuSA@Ti3C2Tx results from the Ru-SAs enhanced H2O adsorption and dissociation, and promoted H2 formation.",EcoMat,10.1002/eom2.12274
Highly efficient overall urea electrolysis via single-atomically active centers on layered double hydroxide,"© 2022 Science China PressAnodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an intriguing half reaction that can replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and work together with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) toward simultaneous hydrogen fuel generation and urea-rich wastewater purification; however, it remains a challenge to achieve overall urea electrolysis with high efficiency. Herein, we report a multifunctional electrocatalyst termed as Rh/NiV-LDH, through integration of nickel-vanadium layered double hydroxide (LDH) with rhodium single-atom catalyst (SAC), to achieve this goal. The electrocatalyst delivers high HER mass activity of 0.262 A mg−1 and exceptionally high turnover frequency (TOF) of 2.125 s−1 at an overpotential of 100 mV. Moreover, exceptional activity toward urea oxidation is addressed, which requires a potential of 1.33 V to yield 10 mA cm−2, endorsing the potential to surmount the sluggish OER. The splendid catalytic activity is enabled by the synergy of the NiV-LDH support and the atomically dispersed Rh sites (located on the Ni-V hollow sites) as evidenced both experimentally and theoretically. The self-supported Rh/NiV-LDH catalyst serving as the anode and cathode for overall urea electrolysis (1 mol L−1 KOH with 0.33 mol L−1 urea as electrolyte) only requires a small voltage of 1.47 V to deliver 100 mA cm−2 with excellent stability.

Co-published by ShanghaiTech University and American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.ConspectusThis Account will provide an overview and analysis on recent research of 3D nanoporous graphene based single-atom electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications. In order to meet the increasing energy demands and assist in the transition from a global economy that relies heavily on fossil fuels to one that utilizes more renewable energy sources, there is urgent need to develop high-performing electrocatalysts toward renewable energy related reactions. These catalysts are expected to have low overpotentials, high reaction selectivity, long cycling stability, and, importantly, lower materials costs to address the challenges of traditional nanoparticulate noble metal catalysts. One approach to conquering a transition of such scale is the use of single-atom electrocatalysts which can bring benefits of lowered materials cost, increased reaction selectivity, and improved catalytic activity. However, despite some success in recent years there remain challenges such as the stability of single-atom catalysts over time, especially at high operating temperatures and potentials, and the limited loading of single-atom catalysts on a support matrix. This Account will discuss the use of graphene as the support matrix with heavy focus on the progress in developing 3D nanoporous graphene, synthesized by chemical vapor deposition. We will cover how 3D nanoporous graphene possesses a large specific surface area, open porosity, high electric conductivity, and bound geometric and topological defects and analyze how it is emerging as an excellent support material for developing chemically stable and catalytically active single-atom catalysts with a large loading amount and high electrocatalytic efficiency. Additionally, we will highlight the benefits of the presence of topological and geometric defects, from curved graphene in the 3D structure, and how they can bring more chemically active sites, and how, together with chemical dopants, they can improve the catalytic performance, stability, and loading amount of single-atom catalysts via their strong chemical affinity with transition metals and the formation of active M-Nx-Cy (M = transition metals, N-nitrogen, C-carbon) moieties. Furthermore, we will discuss two common methods for fabrication of single-atom catalysts on nanoporous graphene: (1) controlled etching for non-noble and noble metal catalysts and (2) atomic layer deposition for noble metal catalysts. The electrochemical performances of these single-atom catalysts will be reviewed with the applications toward hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.

Aligned porous carbon film with ultralow loadings of Pt single atoms and clusters for high-current-density hydrogen generation,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.The development of electrocatalysts toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with high-current-density capability is critical for the practical application of water splitting for hydrogen production. While Pt-based materials are regarded as the most efficient HER catalysts, they suffer from scarcity and high price. Thus, it is of vital importance to lower the loading of Pt while maintaining high activity. Here, we report the fabrication of a monolithic aligned porous carbon film electrode co-modified with Pt single atoms and Pt nanoclusters (Pt SA/NC-AF) containing ultralow Pt content (0.038 wt.%) via a facile electrochemical deposition process. Benefiting from the aligned porous structure of the carbon film and the high exposure of the Pt species, the optimized Pt SA/NC-AF electrode exhibits outstanding HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 with exceptional intrinsic activity (turnover frequency (TOF) = 904.9 s−1 at η = 100 mV) and ultrahigh mass activity (888.6 A·mgPt−1 at · = 100 mV). Further, it can deliver an industrially relevant current density of 1,000 mA·cm−2 at an overpotential as low as 139 mV.

Anchoring Mo Single-Atom Sites on B/N Codoped Porous Carbon Nanotubes for Electrochemical Reduction of N2to NH3,"© Electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (ENRR) at ambient temperature is a futuristic method for the artificial synthesis of ammonia, but it is still not efficient enough to be applied on a large scale.

Ir single atoms modified Ni(OH)2 nanosheets on hierarchical porous nickel foam for efficient oxygen evolution,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Developing highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for electrolytic water splitting is urgently desirable but remains a challenge due to sluggish kinetic process of water oxidation. Herein, we report a one-step electrodeposition strategy to prepare Ni(OH)2 modified with Ir single-atom catalysts (SACs) (Ir SACs/Ni(OH)2) on an electrically conductive substrate of three dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous nickel foam (HP-NF) as efficient OER electrocatalyst.

Various characterizations together with control electrochemical experiments demonstrated that the superior activity and robust stability of Ir SACs/Ni(OH)2@HP-NF for OER are originated from the highly distributed and exposed Ir SACs and 3D interconnected pores of HP-NF with high electric conductivity.

Here, through high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we demonstrated that the interfacial modulation of hexagonal boron nitride/graphene (hBN-graphene) could sufficiently improve the catalytic activity of the single transition metal atom catalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). It was revealed that Re@hBN-graphene and Os@hBN-graphene possessed remarkable NRR catalytic activity with low limiting potentials of 0.29 V and 0.33 V, respectively. Furthermore, the mechanism of the enhanced catalytic activity was investigated based on various descriptors of the adsorption energies of intermediates, where the synergistic effect of hBN and graphene in the hybrid substrate was found to play a key role. Motivated by the synergistic effect of hybrid substrate in single-atom catalysts, a novel strategy was proposed to efficiently design dual-atom catalysts by integrating the merits of both metal components. The as-designed dual-atom catalyst Fe-Mo@hBN exhibited more excellent NRR catalytic performance with a limiting potential of 0.17 V, manifesting the solidity of the design strategy. Our findings open new avenues for the search of heterostructure substrates for single-atom catalysts and the efficient design of dual-atom catalysts for NRR.",Green Energy and Environment,10.1016/j.gee.2022.06.005
Ni Single Atoms and Ni Phosphate Clusters Synergistically Triggered Surface-Functionalized MoS2 Nanosheets for High-performance Freshwater and Seawater Electrolysis,"© 2022 Zhengzhou University.Two-dimensional metal dichalcogenides have been evidenced as potential electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); however, their application is limited by a poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity due to insufficient number/types of multi-integrated active sites. In this study, we report a novel bifunctional catalyst developed by simultaneous engineering of single nickel atoms (NiSA) and nickel phosphate clusters (NiPi) to synergistically trigger surface-functionalized MoS2 nanosheets (NSs) resulting in high reactivities for both HER and OER. The NiSA-NiPi/MoS2 NSs material exhibits a fairly Pt-like HER behavior with an overpotential of 94.0 mV and a small OER overpotential of 314.0 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 in freshwater containing 1.0 M KOH.

Recycling synthesis of single-atom Zn-nitrogen-carbon catalyst for electrocatalytic reduction of O2 to H2O2 ZnNC的循环合成及其在氧还原法制备过氧化氢中的应用,"© 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Portable electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, which is widely used for disinfection, sterilization, and waste treatment, has attracted increasing attention. However, low atomic utilization efficiency and by-product disposal during the synthesis of electrocatalysts are inevitable. Based on the advantages of single-atom catalysts (SACs) towards H2O2 synthesis via a 2e− transfer oxygen reduction reaction, this work presents the synthesis of ZnNC SACs as excellent oxygen reduction catalysts with high atomic use efficiency and almost no generated waste by using formamide and metal powder as precursors. The ZnNC SACs exhibit H2O2 selectivity exceeding 80% when working continuously for 10,000 s. The synthetic strategy described in this paper is intended to be used as a supplement to the synthesis of metal-nitrogen-carbon SACs with high atomic utilization efficiency and low waste generation for environmental and chemical applications.",Science China Materials,10.1007/s40843-022-2054-5
Total conversion of centimeter-scale nickel foam into single atom electrocatalysts with highly selective CO2 electrocatalytic reduction in neutral electrolyte,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.To improve the atomic utilization of metals and reduce the cost of industrialization, the one-step total monoatomization of macroscopic bulk metals, as opposed to nanoscale metals, is effective. In this study, we used a thermal diffusion method to directly convert commercial centimeter-scale Ni foam to porous Ni single-atom-loaded carbon nanotubes (CNTs). As expected, owing to the coating of single-atom on porous, highly conductive CNT carriers, Ni single-atom electrocatalysts (Ni-SACs) exhibit extremely high activity and selectivity in CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), yielding a current density of > 350 mA/cm2, a selectivity for CO of > 91% under a flow cell configuration using a 1 M potassium chloride (KCl) electrolyte. Based on the superior activity of the Ni-SACs electrocatalyst, an integrated gas-phase electrochemical zero-gap reactor was introduced to generate a significant amount of CO current for potential practical applications. The overall current can be increased to 800 mA, while maintaining CO Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) at above 90% per unit cell. Our findings and insights on the active site transformation mechanism for macroscopic bulk Ni foam conversion into single atoms can inform the design of highly active single-atom catalysts used in industrial CO2RR systems.

Turn the Trash into Treasure: Egg-White-Derived Single-Atom Electrocatalysts Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© Egg provides human beings the nutrition and economical products, such as antimicrobial and cosmetics. However, we mainly employ egg yolk, causing tons of egg white as the industrial waste to be further reprocessed. On account of the sustainable issue, we adopt the egg white to prepare single-atom electrocatalysts, achieving a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.927 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction, overperforming the commercial Pt/C (0.857 V) and the conventional iron single-atom electrocatalyst (0.835 V). Using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we decrypt that electrons transfer through the dyz(dxz) orbitals in egg-white-derived single-atom electrocatalysts, facilitating their hybridization with the p orbital in oxygen, reducing the energy barrier in the rate-determining step, and boosting the overall catalytic activity. Our discovery provides an alternative perception to turn trash into treasure and promote sustainability.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c00878
Anchoring boron on a covalent organic framework as an efficient single atom metal-free photo-electrocatalyst for nitrogen fixation: a first-principles analysis,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe production of ammonia in a sustainable cost-effective manner and ambient conditions is a very challenging task. Photo-/electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (NRR) is a convenient way to produce NH3 for industrial applications. In this work, anchoring B atoms in Tp-bpy-COF is shown to effectively reduce N2 to NH3. By employing density functional theory, we demonstrated that N2 can be efficiently activated on the B center due to the synergistic effect of B-N. Meanwhile, we found that the NRR happens predominantly by the alternating path with a small limiting potential of 0.13 V. Moreover, the suitable band edge positions and broad visible light absorption zone result in B@Tp-bpy-COF acting as a promising photocatalyst. Our proposed catalytic system exhibits favorable formation energy and excellent structural stability during AIMD simulations, which suggest the feasibility of experimental synthesis. The system turns out to be highly selective toward the NRR compared to other competitive reactions. These findings may pave a new way for designing SACs on COFs for N2 fixation with high activity, which may also apply to other reactions.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d1cp05699a
Single-Atom Mo Anchored on a Poly(heptazine imide) Nanosheet as a Novel Electrocatalyst Showing Excellent Behavior toward Nitrogen Reduction Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Converting nitrogen into ammonia relying on the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great significance for sustaining life, and the development and screening of efficient electrocatalysts increasingly represent a major chemistry challenge. Herein, from density functional theory simulations, a series of recently developed poly(heptazine imide) (PHI)-anchored single-atom catalysts were investigated as the potential electrocatalysts for NRR, based on thermodynamics and kinetics analysis. The results reveal that the Mo-PHI nanosheet can effectively activate the inert N2 and promote N2 reduction to NH3 via the distal mechanism, which shows much better electrocatalytic activity than those of most ever-reported single-atom electrocatalysts, as reflected by the significantly much lower overpotential (0.05 V) and activation barrier (1.15 eV). The extraordinary activity of the Mo-PHI single layer is closely related to the efficient redistribution of electron density upon the adsorption of N2 molecules, which can promote the electron transfer from the substrate to the electron acceptors, N2. Moreover, the down-shift of projected density of states and the appropriately large d-band center (ϵd) of the central Mo metal is beneficial to the N2 adsorption for further reduction to generate NH3. Our predictions hence suggest the as-designed Mo-PHI single layer as a superior promising catalyst for efficient dinitrogen fixation and reduction.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c00312
Computational screening of single-atom catalysts supported by VS2 monolayers for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction/evolution reactions,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The development of highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts to boost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for energy conversion and storage devices. Herein, by means of comprehensive first-principles computations, we systematically explored the catalytic activities of a series of single transition metal atoms anchored on two-dimensional VS2 monolayers (TM@VS2) for ORR/OER. Our results revealed that Ni@VS2 exhibits low overpotentials for both ORR (0.45 V) and OER (0.31 V), suggesting its great potential as a bifunctional catalyst, which is mainly induced by its moderate interaction with oxygenated intermediates according to the established scaling relationship and volcano plot. Interestingly, the substituted doping of nitrogen heteroatoms into the VS2 substrate can further effectively improve the ORR/OER activity of the active metal atom to achieve more eligible ORR/OER bifunctional catalysts. Our results not only propose a new class of potential bifunctional oxygen catalysts but also offer a feasible strategy for further tuning their catalytic activity.",Nanoscale,10.1039/d2nr01671k
Dynamic coordination transformation of active sites in single-atom MoS2 catalysts for boosted oxygen evolution catalysis,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe development of low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for enhancing the efficiency of the water-splitting reaction. Although MoS2 is a promising hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst, its oxygen evolution activity is significantly poor due to its weak adsorption for oxidative intermediates such as OH* and OOH*. Here, we present a strategy for designing 3d-TM-Ox (x = 3, 6; TM: transition metal) single-atom catalytic sites to achieve high catalytic activity towards the OER through an unprecedented dynamic coordination transformation from [TMO6] to [TMO3]. By using first-principles calculations and molecular dynamic simulations, we predict single 3d-transition metal atoms (3d-TM) co-doped with six oxygen atoms of MoS2 (3d-TMO6@MoS2) with hexa-coordinated TM (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe and Co) and tri-coordinated TM (TM = Ni, Cu and Zn) structures. Our calculations show that these hexa-coordinated TMs are induced to transform into a tetra-coordinated structure as oxidative intermediates approach. The dynamic single-atom catalytic mechanism makes active sites and adsorption-responsive orbitals exposed, which is favorable to strengthen the adsorption of oxidative intermediates and improve the OER catalytic activity. Comparative calculations demonstrate that TMO6@MoS2 (TM = Fe, Mn and Co) species render better electrocatalytic activity for the OER than benchmark IrO2. Experimental Raman studies verified that FeO6@MoS2 experiences coordination transformation from [TMO6] to [TMO3] during the OER process. The low overpotential of 0.18 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and good structural stability are consistent with our computational prediction. The present study sheds light on deep understanding of single-atom catalytic structures in transition metal dichalcogenides and the methodology to tune the catalytic activity of single-atom sites.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/d1ee02750f
Experimental and Theoretical Advances on Single Atom and Atomic Cluster-Decorated Low-Dimensional Platforms towards Superior Electrocatalysts,"© 2022 The Authors.

"Strategic Modulation of Target-Specific Isolated Fe,Co Single-Atom Active Sites for Oxygen Electrocatalysis Impacting High Power Zn-Air Battery","© 2022 American Chemical Society.An effective modulation of the active sites in a bifunctional electrocatalyst is essentially desired, and it is a challenge to outperform the state-of-the-art catalysts toward oxygen electrocatalysis. Herein, we report the development of a bifunctional electrocatalyst having target-specific Fe-N4/C and Co-N4/C isolated active sites, exhibiting a symbiotic effect on overall oxygen electrocatalysis performances. The dualism of N-dopants and binary metals lower the d-band centers of both Fe and Co in the Fe,Co,N-C catalyst, improving the overpotential of the overall electrocatalytic processes (ΔEORR-OER = 0.74 ± 0.02 V vs RHE). Finally, the Fe,Co,N-C showed a high areal power density of 198.4 mW cm-2 and 158 mW cm-2 in the respective liquid and solid-state Zn-air batteries (ZABs), demonstrating suitable candidature of the active material as air cathode material in ZABs.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.2c00547
Hierarchically porous Fe/N/S/C nanospheres with high-content of Fe-Nx for enhanced ORR and Zn-air battery performance,"© 2022 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of SciencesHeteroatom-doped carbon-based transition-metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, with the aid of hierarchically porous silica as hard template, a facile and general melting perfusion and mesopore-confined pyrolysis method was reported to prepare single-atomic Fe/N–S-doped carbon catalyst (FeNx/NC-S) with hierarchically porous structure and well-defined morphology. The FeNx/NC-S exhibited excellent ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.92 V, and a lower overpotential of 320 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for OER under alkaline condition. The remarkable electrocatalysis performance can be attributed to the hierarchically porous carbon nanospheres with S doping and high content of Fe-Nx sites (up to 3.7 wt% of Fe), resulting from the nano-confinement effect of the hierarchically porous silica spheres (NKM-5) during the pyrolysis process. The rechargeable Zn-air battery with FeNx/NC-S as a cathode catalyst demonstrated a superior power density of 194.5 mW cm−2 charge–discharge stability.

First-row transition metal embedded pyrazine-based graphynes as high-performance single atom catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistrySingle atom catalysts (SACs) have displayed unprecedented activity and selectivity toward the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, first-row transition metal embedded pyrazine-based graphynes (TM-pyGYs) were evaluated as potential SACs for the CO2RR by using density functional theory. The computational results showed that TM-pyGYs exhibited large cohesive energies ranging from 6.67 to 6.78 eV per atom and metal binding energies ranging from 0.79 to 5.48 eV. Electronic structure analyses demonstrated the strong covalent bond, large charge transfer, and distinct orbital overlap between the TM atoms and pyGY, which proved the high stability of TM-pyGYs in the CO2RR. Most TM-pyGYs exhibited preferred CO2RR selectivity over the hydrogen evolution reaction. The most favorable reaction pathways of the CO2RR to CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, and CH4 on TM-pyGYs were systematically explored. Among all the TM-pyGYs, Mn/Fe/Ni-pyGYs were determined to be outstanding electrocatalysts in the CO2RR for producing HCOOH with low limiting potentials of −0.21 to −0.36 V, and Co-pyGY exhibited high-performance CO2RR to CH4 with a low limiting potential of −0.35 V, which surpassed the performance of the vast majority of electrocatalysts. With applied potential, Fe/Co/Ni-pyGYs exhibited great advantages in the CO2RR to CH4. The results of this work highlighted TM-pyGYs as ideal SACs for the electrochemical CO2RR.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta00654e
Isolated Co Atoms Anchored on Defective Nitrogen-doped Carbon Graphene as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysts,"© 2022 Zhengzhou University.Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the heart of many new energy conversions and storage devices, such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells. However, ORR is currently facing the dilemma of sluggish intrinsic kinetics and the noble electrocatalysts of high price and low reserves. In this work, isolated Co atoms anchored on defective nitrogen-doped carbon graphene single-atom catalyst (Co-SAC/NC) are synthesized via the proposed movable type printing method. The prepared Co-SAC/NC catalyst demonstrates admirable ORR performance, with a high half-wave potential of 0.884 V in alkaline electrolytes and outstanding durability. In addition, an assembled zinc–air battery with prepared Co-SAC/NC as air-cathode catalyst displays a high-peak power density of 179 mW cm−2 and a high-specific capacity (757 mAh g−1). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the true active sites of the prepared catalyst are Co-N4 moieties, and further reveal a significantly electronic structure evolution of Co sites in the ORR process, in which the project density of states and local magnetic moment of Co atom varies during its whole reaction process. This work not only paves a new avenue for synthesizing SACs as robust electrocatalysts, but also provides an electronic-level insight into the evolution of the electronic structure of single-atom catalysts.",Energy and Environmental Materials,10.1002/eem2.12371
Ultrahigh oxygen evolution reaction activity in Au doped co-based nanosheets,"© 2022 The Author(s).Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has attracted enormous interest as a key process for water electrolysis over the past years. The advance of this process relies on an effective catalyst. Herein, we employed single-atom Au doped Co-based nanosheets (NSs) to theoretically and experimentally evaluate the OER activity and also the interaction between Co and Au. We reveal that Au-Co(OH)2 NSs achieved a low overpotential of 0.26 V at 10 mA cm_2. This extraordinary phenomenon presents an overall superior performance greater than state-of-the-art Co-based catalysts in a sequence of a-Co(OH)2 < Co3O4 < CoOOH < Au-Co(OH)2. With ab initio calculations and analysis in the specific Au-Co(OH)2 configuration, we reveal that OER on highly active Au-Co(OH)2 originates from lattice oxygen, which is different from the conventional adsorbate evolution scheme. Explicitly, the configuration of Au-Co(OH)2 gives rise to oxygen non-bonding (ONB) states and oxygen holes, allowing direct O-O bond formation by a couple of oxidized oxygen with oxygen holes, offering a high OER activity. This study provides new insights for elucidating the origins of activity and synthesizing efficient OER electrocatalysts.",RSC Advances,10.1039/d1ra09094a
Surface Molecular Encapsulation with Cyclodextrin in Promoting the Activity and Stability of Fe Single-Atom Catalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2022 Zhengzhou University.Fe single-atom catalysts (Fe-SACs) have been extensively studied as a highly efficient electrocatalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Nonetheless, they suffer from stability issue induced by dissolution of Fe metal center and the OH− blocking. Herein, a surface molecular engineering strategy is developed by using β-cyclodextrins (CDs) as a localized molecular encapsulation. The CD-modified Fe-SAC (Fe-SNC-β-CD) shows obviously improved activity toward the ORR with 0.90 V, 4.10 and 4.09 mA cm−2 for E1/2, J0 and Jk0.9, respectively. Meanwhile, the Fe-SNC-β-CD shows the excellent long-term stability against aggressive stress and the poisoning. It is confirmed through electrochemical investigation that modification of β-CD can, on one hand, regulate the atomic Fe coordination chemistry through the interaction between the CD and FeNx moiety, while on the other mitigate the strong adsorption of OH− and function as protective barrier against the poisoning molecules leading to enhanced ORR activity and stability for the Fe-SACs. The molecular encapsulation strategy demonstrates the uniqueness of post-pyrolysis surface molecular engineering for the design of single-atom catalyst.",Energy and Environmental Materials,10.1002/eem2.12346

B2O and B4N monolayers supported single-metal atom as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and ORR,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The development of high efficiency, stable and economical electrocatalysts is an ideal choice for water electrolysis, fuel cells and metal air cells, and an important innovation in the future energy field. Bifunctional or even multifunctional catalysts have higher performance and lower cost than monofunctional catalysts, which is currently an emerging focus in the development of electrocatalysts. The single-atom catalysts (SACs) of two-dimensional (2D) materials-supported transition metal (TM) atoms have attracted great attention because of their ability to make full use of metal atoms and remarkable catalytic performance. In this work, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic properties of B4N and B2O monolayers supported TM atoms have been systematically evaluated based on first-principles calculations. The adsorption free energy of key intermediates (OOH*, O* and OH*) on the catalyst determines the catalytic activity toward OER and ORR. The calculation results exhibit that Ni@B4N and Pd@B2O systems are potential bifunctional electrocatalysts with the overpotential (η) of OER/ORR being just 0.45/0.43 V and 0.56/0.47 V, respectively, which are comparable to the known noble metal catalysts. Therefore, the study of catalytic activity of SACs on 2D substrate materials provides a broad prospect for the development of stable, low-cost, high-activity noble metal-free electrocatalysts, and provides help for solving energy and environmental problems.",Journal of Materials Science,10.1007/s10853-021-06578-7

"Atomically Dispersed, Low-Coordinate Co–N Sites on Carbon Nanotubes as Inexpensive and Efficient Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution","© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHHydrogen produced using renewable electricity is considered the key to achieving a low-carbon energy economy. However, the large-scale application of electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen evolution currently requires expensive platinum-based catalysts. Therefore, it is important to develop efficient and stable catalysts based on the rich reserves of transition metals as alternatives. In this study, the authors prepare a carbon-nanotube material enriched with atomically dispersed CoN sites having uniquely low coordination numbers via the simple mixing, pyrolysis, and leaching of inexpensive precursors. These atomically dispersed low-coordinate CoN sites provide an overpotential of only 82 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under challenging acidic conditions and show excellent durability in accelerated stability tests. Theoretical simulations also confirm that these unique, low-coordinate CoN2 sites have lower energy barriers in catalyzing the HER than Fe/NiN2 sites and commonly reported CoN3/N4 sites. Therefore, the method provides a new concept for the design of single-atom catalytic sites with low coordination numbers. It also serves to reduce the cost of hydrogen production in the future owing to the high catalytic activity, low cost, and scalable production process.",Small,10.1002/smll.202105335
Defect-Assisted Anchoring of Pt Single Atoms on MoS2 Nanosheets Produces High-Performance Catalyst for Industrial Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHPt-based catalysts are currently the most efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but the scarcity and high cost of Pt limit industrial applications. Downsizing Pt nanoparticles (NPs) to single atoms (SAs) can expose more active sites and increase atomic utilization, thus decreasing the cost. Here, a solar-irradiation strategy is used to prepare hybrid SA-Pt/MoS2 nanosheets (NSs) that demonstrate excellent HER activity (the overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10) of 44 mV, and Tafel slope of 34.83 mV dec−1 in acidic media; η10 of 123 mV, and Tafel slope of 76.71 mV dec−1 in alkaline media). Defects and deformations introduced by thermal pretreatment of the hydrothermal MoS2 NSs promote anchoring and stability of Pt SAs. The fabrication of Pt SAs and NPs is easily controlled using different Pt-precursor concentrations. Moreover, SA-Pt/MoS2 produced under natural sunlight exhibits high HER performance (η10 of 55 mV, and Tafel slope of 43.54 mV dec−1), which indicates its viability for mass production. Theoretical simulations show that Pt improves the absorption of H atoms and the charge-transfer kinetics of MoS2, which significantly enhance HER activity.

Herein, we fabricated Co SACs with tunable isolated Co-N5-xCx (x = 1, 2, 3) sites supported on porous carbon frameworks. Benefiting from the difference in electronegativity of the coordinated N and C atoms, the CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) enhanced considerably from 54% to 76% and 92% at −0.8 V vs. RHE for Co-N4C1, Co-N3C2, and Co-N2C3, respectively.

Atomically Dispersed Zinc(I) Active Sites to Accelerate Nitrogen Reduction Kinetics for Ammonia Electrosynthesis,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHDeveloping highly active and stable nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) catalysts for NH3 electrosynthesis remains challenging. Herein, an unusual NRR electrocatalyst is reported with a single Zn(I) site supported on hollow porous N-doped carbon nanofibers (Zn1N–C). The Zn1N–C nanofibers exhibit an outstanding NRR activity with a high NH3 yield rate of ≈16.1 µg NH3 h−1 mgcat−1 at −0.3 V and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 11.8% in alkaline media, surpassing other previously reported carbon-based NRR electrocatalysts with transition metals atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated (TM-Nx) sites. 15N2 isotope labeling experiments confirm that the feeding nitrogen gas is the only nitrogen source in the production of NH3. Structural characterization reveals that atomically dispersed Zn(I) sites with Zn–N4 moieties are likely the active sites, and the nearby graphitic N site synergistically facilitates the NRR process. In situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared measurement and theoretical calculation elucidate that the formation of initial *NNH intermediate is the rate-limiting step during the NH3 production. The graphitic N atoms adjacent to the tetracoordinate Zn–N4 moieties could significantly lower the energy barrier for this step to accelerate hydrogenation kinetics duing the NRR.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202103548

Single-Atom Catalyst Aggregates: Size-Matching is Critical to Electrocatalytic Performance in Sulfur Cathodes,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHElectrocatalysis is critical to the performance displayed by sulfur cathodes. However, the constituent electrocatalysts and the sulfur reactants have vastly different molecular sizes, which ultimately restrict electrocatalysis efficiency and hamper device performance. Herein, the authors report that aggregates of cobalt single-atom catalysts (SACs) attached to graphene via porphyrins can overcome the challenges associated with the catalyst/reactant size mismatch. Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the Co atoms present in the SAC aggregates exist as single atoms with spatially resolved dimensions that are commensurate the sulfur species found in sulfur cathodes and thus fully accessible to enable 100% atomic utilization efficiency in electrocatalysis. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the Co SAC aggregates can interact with the sulfur species in a synergistic manner that enhances the electrocatalytic effect and promote the performance of sulfur cathodes. For example, Li–S cells prepared from the Co SAC aggregates exhibit outstanding capacity retention (i.e., 505 mA h g–1 at 0.5 C after 600 cycles) and excellent rate capability (i.e., 648 mA h g−1 at 6 C). An ultrahigh area specific capacity of 12.52 mA h cm−2 is achieved at a high sulfur loading of 11.8 mg cm–2.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.202103773

Loading Single-Ni Atoms on Assembled Hollow N-Rich Carbon Plates for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe rational design of catalysts’ spatial structure is vitally important to boost catalytic performance through exposing the active sites, enhancing the mass transfer, and confining the reactants. Herein, a dual-linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework-engaged strategy is developed to construct assembled hollow plates (AHP) of N-rich carbon (NC), which is loaded with single-Ni atoms to form a highly efficient electrocatalyst (designated as Ni-NC(AHP)). In the carbonization process, the thermally unstable linker (5-aminotetrazole) serves as the self-sacrificial template and the other linker (2-methylimidazole) mainly serves as the carbon and nitrogen source to form hollow NC matrix. The formed Ni-NC(AHP) catalyst possesses enhanced mesoporosity and more available surface area, thus promoting mass transport and affording abundant accessible single-Ni sites. These features contribute to remarkable performance for electrochemical CO2 reduction with exceptionally high selectivity of nearly 100% towards CO in a wide potential range and dramatically enhanced CO partial current density.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202105204
Low-Coordinated Co-N-C on Oxygenated Graphene for Efficient Electrocatalytic H2O2 Production,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHElectrochemical H2O2 production through the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a promising alternative to the energy-intensive anthraquinone process. Herein, by simultaneously regulating the coordination number of the atomically dispersed cobalt sites and the nearby oxygen functional groups via a one-step microwave thermal shock, a highly selective and active Co-N-C electrocatalyst for H2O2 electrosynthesis that exhibits a high H2O2 selectivity (91.3%), outstanding mass activity (44.4 A g−1 at 0.65 V), and large kinetic current density (11.3 mA cm−2 at 0.65 V) in 0.1 m KOH is obtained. In strong contrast to the typical Co-N4 moieties for the 4-electron ORR, the present Co-N-C catalyst possesses a low-coordinated Co-N2 configuration and abundant epoxide groups, which work in synergy for promoting the 2-electron ORR, as demonstrated by a series of control experiments and theoretical simulations. This study may provide an effective avenue to modulating the composition and structure of electrocatalysts at the atomic scale, leading to the development of new electrocatalysts with unprecedented reactivity.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202106886
Taming the challenges of activity and selectivity in catalysts for electrochemical N2 fixation via single metal atom supported on WS2,"© 2021Developing the novel types of electrocatalysts with intrinsic stability, high activity and selectivity is a significant mission to advance the sustainable conversion of naturally abundant N2 to NH3, but it remains a long-standing challenge. Herein, through theoretical screening approach, focusing on addressing this challenge, we rationally designed a series of WS2 monolayer decorated by single transition metal (TM) atom as TM@WS2 candidates and systematically explored their potentials for catalyzing N2 reduction by building a full profile of stability, activity and selectivity. Our results unveil that, among 26 candidates, Cr@WS2, Tc@WS2 and Os@WS2 finally stand out as the most promising candidates, on which the adsorbed N2 molecule can be efficiently converted into NH3 through the distal mechanism with the limiting potentials of −0.37, −0.27 and −0.33 V, respectively, and impressively, the competing HER process can be pronouncedly inhibited. In particular, the activity trend is constructed by using *NNH adsorption energy and φ, and ICOHP reveals the origin of catalytic activity toward NRR. Our investigation not only contributes to the development of the highly efficient electrocatalysts, but also provides insightful views on the optimal design of WS2-based catalysts for advanced NH3 synthesis.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151357
Integration of Morphology and Electronic Structure Modulation on Atomic Iron-Nitrogen-Carbon Catalysts for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHAtomic transition-metal-nitrogen-carbon catalysts (M-N-Cs) hold great promise as Pt-group-metal-free candidates for electrochemical reactions, yet their rational design and controllable synthesis remain fundamental challenges. Here, the molten-salts mediated pyrolysis is demonstrated to be an effective and facile strategy for simultaneous morphology and electronic structure modulation of prototypical Fe-N-C materials, which functions as efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalysts. Taking advantage of the strong polarity and salt templating effects, the as-obtained Fe-N/C-single atom catalyst (SAC) possesses hierarchical porous nanosheet morphology with an impressive specific surface area of 2237 m2 g−1 and unique FeN4Cl moieties as isolated active centers. The Fe-N/C-SAC delivers remarkable alkaline oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a half-wave potential of 0.91 V and record kinetic current density up to 55 mA cm−2, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C. By virtue of dechlorination treatment, it is experimentally identified that the enhanced ORR activities are essentially governed by the axially bound Cl. Theoretical calculations rationalize this finding and demonstrate that the well-defined fivefold-coordinated configuration accelerates 4e− pathway kinetics through near-optimal adsorption of the *OH intermediates and tunes the potential determining step from *OH reduction to *OOH formation. This study provides fundamental insights into the coordination-engineered strategy in single-atom catalysis.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202108345
Central metal and ligand effects on oxygen electrocatalysis over 3d transition metal single-atom catalysts: A theoretical investigation,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) have recently emerged as promising alternatives to precious metal-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. Currently, the role of the metal centre and local coordination environment on the ORR/OER activity of metal SACs remains unclear. Herein, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically study oxygen electrocatalysis on 60 different 3d transition metal SACs (scandium to zinc, supported on heteroatom-doped graphene supports), encompassing three symmetric nitrogen coordination configurations (i.e., M−Nn−C, n = 4, 3, 2) and three asymmetric coordination configurations (i.e., M−N3X−C, X = P, S, B). The calculations reveal the central metal and the coordinating atoms strongly influence oxygen electrocatalysis over 3d transition metal SACs, predominantly by tuning the adsorption free energy of adsorbed hydroxyl (ΔG*OH, a key descriptor of both ORR and OER activity). Dual limiting potential volcano curves were constructed for ORR and OER, with Ni-N2-C identified as the optimal synthetic target for bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysis, closely followed by Fe-N4-C, Co-N4-C, Co-N2-C, and Ni-N3P-C.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.132038
Synergistic effect between platinum single atoms and oxygen vacancy in MoO2 boosting pH-Universal hydrogen evolution reaction at large current density,"© 2021Single-atomic or cluster-based precious metals provide an effective pathway to minimize the cost of catalysts. However, its stability at large current density is still a major hurdle to satisfy practical requirements for electrocatalytic Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we successfully anchored Pt single atoms (Pt SAs) in the oxygen vacancies (Ovac) of Molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) as advanced HER electrocatalyst. Experimental and theoretical calculations results reveal that the Ovac can not only stabilize Pt SAs, but also modulate the electronic structure of the active site, enabling Pt SAs/MoO2 to exhibit superior HER activity in a wide pH electrolyte at large current density. Especially, the 1.1 wt% Pt SAs/MoO2 deliver ultralow overpotentials (9.3, 14, and 16 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and small Tafel slopes (28.78, 36.86, and 65.18 mV dec-1) in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. Moreover, it displays significantly enhanced mass activity of up to 28, 32, and 56 times compared to the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst, and outstanding long-term durability (~200 h) at large current density of −1000 mA cm−2. The significantly improved HER performances are mainly ascribed to the synergistic catalytic effects of between Pt SAs and Ovac in MoO2. These impressive findings can provide insights into the rational design of electrocatalysts that used for future clean energy utilization.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.131309
Termination effects of single-atom decorated v-Mo2CTx MXene for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.The lack of the green, economical and high-efficient catalysts restrict the development of electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). By means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have systematically investigated the NRR catalytic performance of single atoms decorated v-Mo2CT2 (T = O, F, OH, Cl, and Li) MXene (TM@v-Mo2CT2). Our calculation results reveal the introduction of single atom can significantly improve the NRR activity and selectivity on v-Mo2CO2, and Ir@v-Mo2CO2 system possesses the lowest limiting potential of only −0.33 V among all studied systems. The termination effects of TM@v-Mo2CT2 are further discussed and a descriptor of the adsorption energy of *NNH species (ΔE(*NNH)) is proposed to establish the relationship with NRR limiting potential (UL(NRR)), in which a moderate (ΔE(*NNH)) is required for high NRR activity. Moreover, a good linear relationship between the ΔE(*NNH) and the excess electrons on Ir atom shows that different ΔE(*NNH) originates from the difference of valence state of Ir atom, which is due to the change of coordination environment. Importantly, the synergistic effects of Ir atom and the surface O-terminations during the first hydrogenation step lead to a promoted NRR performance. Our study might provide new possibilities for rational design of cost-effective MXene-based NRR electrocatalysts.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2021.07.083
Active site engineering of single-atom carbonaceous electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.The electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the vital process at the cathode of next-generation electrochemical storage and conversion technologies, such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Single-metal-atom and nitrogen co-doped carbonaceous electrocatalysts (M-N-C) have emerged as attractive alternatives to noble-metal platinum for catalyzing the kinetically sluggish ORR due to their high electrical conductivity, large surface area, and structural tunability at the atomic level, however, their application is limited by the low intrinsic activity of the metal-nitrogen coordination sites (M-Nx) and inferior site density. In this Perspective, we summarize the recent progress and milestones relating to the active site engineering of single atom carbonous electrocatalysts for enhancing the ORR activity. Particular emphasis is placed on the emerging strategies for regulating the electronic structure of the single metal site and populating the site density. In addition, challenges and perspectives are provided regarding the future development of single atom carbonous electrocatalysts for the ORR and their utilization in practical use.",Chemical Science,10.1039/d1sc05867c
Atomically Dispersed Mo Sites Anchored on Multichannel Carbon Nanofibers toward Superior Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Developing affordable and efficient electrocatalysts as precious metal alternatives toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucially essential for the substantial progress of sustainable H2 energy-related technologies. The dual manipulation of coordination chemistry and geometric configuration for single-atom catalysts (SACs) has emerged as a powerful strategy to surmount the thermodynamic and kinetic dilemmas for high-efficiency electrocatalysis. We herein rationally designed N-doped multichannel carbon nanofibers supporting atomically dispersed Mo sites coordinated with C, N, and O triple components (labeled as Mo@NMCNFs hereafter) as a superior HER electrocatalyst. Systematic characterizations revealed that the local coordination microenvironment of Mo is determined to be a Mo-O1N1C2 moiety, which was theoretically probed to be the energetically favorable configuration for H intermediate adsorption by density functional theory calculations. Structurally, the multichannel porous carbon nanofibers with open ends could effectively enlarge the exposure of active sites, facilitate mass diffusion/charge transfer, and accelerate H2 release, leading to promoted reaction kinetics. Consequently, the optimized Mo@NMCNFs exhibited superior Pt-like HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte with an overpotential of 66 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a Tafel slope of 48.9 mV dec-1, and excellent stability, outperforming a vast majority of the previously reported nonprecious HER electrocatalysts. The concept of both geometric and electronic engineering of SACs in this work may provide guidance for the design of high-efficiency molecule-like heterogeneous catalysts for a myriad of energy technologies.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.1c07694
Current trends and perspectives on emerging Fe-derived noble-metal-free oxygen electrocatalysts,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.Oxygen electrochemistry that comprises oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR) is vital for sustainable, clean, and efficient energy generation. However, the high activation barrier due to the multi-electron transfer process makes them sluggish and requires noble metals (e.g. Ir, Ru, or Pt) to overcome the kinetic barrier. This increases the cost of sustainable devices such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells and, in turn, obstructs their wide-scale applications. In this context, it is necessary to explore noble-metal-free efficient oxygen electrocatalysts to produce a surge in the practical applicability of these technologies. Since Fe facilitates these reactions and is widely available, it has emerged as an element of interest in different forms, such as oxides, phosphides, chalcogenides, layered double hydroxides, Fe-N-C, single atoms, and some other hetero-structured composites with carbon-based (graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc.) materials. This review assesses the strategies utilized in the development of Fe-derived materials without involving noble metals in the catalysis under alkaline conditions. It also focuses on the approaches used to transform well-known Fe-derived ORR materials to OER and vice versa or into bifunctional catalysts. Furthermore, we highlight the significant role of modifying various fundamentally important parameters, such as the fabrication methods and their consequent morphological and electronic deviations in establishing promising new Fe-based catalytic materials. This assessment will bring valuable fit to the existing literature and assist in gaining important information to extract practical applications from Fe-derived noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.

Highly Active Atomically Dispersed Co–Nx Sites Anchored on Ultrathin N-Doped Carbon Nanosheets with Durability Oxygen Reduction Reaction of Zinc–Air Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyHighly efficient and low-cost oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts play key roles in the development of advanced energy conversion and storage devices, such as fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Herein, a facile strategy of synthesizing cobalt single atoms anchored on an ultrathin N-doped carbon nanosheet electrocatalyst (marked as CoSAs/N-CNS) via an in situ g-C3N4 template strategy was reported. Impressively, benefiting from highly active Co–Nx sites and highly porous and ultrathin nanosheet morphology which has rich edges and more three-phase boundaries, the as-synthesized CoSAs/N-CNS exhibits markedly enhanced ORR activities under alkaline conditions with half-wave potential (E1/2) as high as 0.91 V vs RHE, as well as durability of ∼67 h. Furthermore, compared with Pt/C, the CoSAs/N-CNS-based Zn–air battery presents outstanding discharge–charge performance, larger power density of 157.7 mW cm–2, and robust durability with a slight decay after 150 h (900 cycles). The experimental and theoretical results fully show the advantages of CoSAs/N-CNS, which also provides a new insight for the design and development of high-performance atomically dispersed metal active site electrocatalysts toward ORR.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c05352
Design Principles of Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Engineered Interfaces in Na–S Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyThe shuttling of soluble sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn) and sluggish conversion kinetics are major roadblocks toward the practical realization of sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries. To undertake the challenges, we use first-principles calculations to design bifunctional electrocatalysts to achieve engineered interfaces with sulfur-based cathode materials. We illustrate the detailed behavior of Na2Sn adsorption, sulfur reduction reactions (SRRs), and catalytic decomposition on transition-metal (TM)-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) embedded on MoS2 substrates (SACs@MoS2). We observe that SACs doped on sulfur substitution and molybdenum top sites result in adequate binding energies to immobilize higher-order Na2Sn species. We found the d-band center as an important “descriptor” in dictating polysulfide adsorption energies and catalytic activities on SACs@MoS2. We elucidate that the larger upward shift of the d-band center toward the Fermi level and the involved higher number of vacant antibonding states are directly correlated to the adsorption strength of the Na2Sn. The V and Ni SACs are found to exhibit higher and lower binding energies, respectively, consistent with the d-band theory. Furthermore, the SACs that are electron-deficient sites demonstrate bifunctional electrocatalytic activity through reduced free energy for SRR and lower the barrier for Na2S decomposition in favor of accelerated electrode kinetics during discharge and charge processes, respectively. The electronic structure calculations reveal a significantly reduced band gap of the pristine and Na2Sn-adsorbed SACs@MoS2 due to mid-gap states, majorly stemming from TM-d orbitals, thus expected to improve the electronic conductivity of the substrates. The insight developed on the role of SACs in tailoring the polysulfides’ chemistry at the interfaces in relation to their d-band center is an important step toward the rational design of cathode materials for high-performance Na–S batteries.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.1c04739
Pyrolysis-free synthesis of single-atom cobalt catalysts for efficient oxygen reduction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Nitrogen-coordinated single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to noble metal-containing benchmarks for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the commonly required high-temperature pyrolysis usually results in undesirable structural changes and randomly produced active sites which gives rise to great challenges to the structure-property relationships, inevitably hindering the understanding of the reaction mechanisms. Herein, we demonstrate a simple yet robust pyrolysis-free route to craft single-atom cobalt catalysts with high electrocatalytic ORR activity via judiciously in situ wrapping an electrocatalytically active porphyrin-based thiophene-sulfur site-containing covalent organic polymer (PTS-COP) shell around a highly conductive multiwalled CNT (MWCNT) core, followed by accurately anchoring single-atom Co-N4 sites onto the macrocyclic porphyrin structure. The resulting Co-PTS-COPs@MWCNTs was exploited as an ORR electrocatalyst and displayed outstanding performance as a direct consequence of the advantageous architecture (i.e., 1D core@shell heterostructures with few-layer-thick PTS-COP shells) and unique active site configurations (i.e., atomically anchored Co-N4 sites and homogeneously dispersed thiophene-sulfur sites). Remarkably, an alkaline electrolyte capitalizing on Co-PTS-COPs@MWCNTs achieved excellent ORR activity (Eonset, 0.930 V; E1/2, 0.835 V), and favourable long-term durability, comparable to that of state-of-the-art carbon-based electrocatalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta08412g
Direct ammonia synthesis from the air via gliding arc plasma integrated with single atom electrocatalysis,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Industrial ammonia synthesis revolutionized global agriculture and industry, but it consumes significant amounts of energy and releases vast quantities of CO2. One alternative, electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction generally suffers from a low ammonia yield rate and poor selectivity. Here, a tandem “plasma-electrocatalysis” strategy was proposed to harvest ammonia from the air. An ammonia yield rate (~1.43 mgNH3 cm-2 h-1) with almost 100% faradaic efficiency was achieved during over 50 hours of stable operation at -0.33 V vs. RHE. The ammonia yield rate reached up to ~3.0 mgNH3 cm-2 h-1 with a faradaic efficiency of ~62% at -0.63 V vs. RHE. This marked performance is achieved by separating activation of stable nitrogen molecules via non-thermal plasma, followed by selective ammonia synthesis via a cobalt single-atom electrocatalyst. This strategy may rival the Haber-Bosch process and the aspirational electrochemical nitrogen reduction at a distributed small-size ammonia production based on a techno-economic analysis.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120667
Single-atom platinum or ruthenium on C4N as 2D high-performance electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2021Pt/C is a practical electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in metal-air batteries and fuel cells, however, also suffers the drawbacks of high cost and instability, which have propelled people to search for new substitutes, such as single-atom metal electrocatalysts. Herein, C4N was firstly synthesized from 2,3-diyldiamine phenazine via one-step hydrothermal method rather than the traditional way that two monomers react in organic solvent, and then loaded with single-atom metal (Pt or Ru) to form new electrocatalysts. The so-formed M@C4N (M = Pt or Ru) electrocatalysts show more excellent ORR performances with higher half-wave potential and better stability and methanol tolerance as compared with the commercial Pt/C. Specifically, the half-wave potential of 1%Pt@C4N and 0.5%Ru@C4N is 0.861 V and 0.828 V, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that 1%Pt@C4N has stronger adsorption of reactant species and faster kinetics than 0.5%Ru@C4N in ORR pathway.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.131347
High-entropy carbons: From high-entropy aromatic species to single-atom catalysts for electrocatalysis,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have rapidly entered the field of nanomaterials and demonstrated great potential for energy devices in recent years. Of all types of SACs, porous carbon-based SACs are the most popular species because of their excellent conductivity, large specific surface area, and easily tunable heteroatom and metal components. However, most of the reported cases focus on the metal centers and their coordination environments, while they do not pay much attention to carbon precursors and carbon transformation during high-temperature treatment. In this work, we use a high-entropy aromatic molecule, azulene, for rational synthesis of azulene-enriched, sandwich-like polymer nanosheets and corresponding single-Fe-dispersed porous carbon nanosheets. The azulene-based metal-free polymer nanosheets exhibit a narrow band gap and temperature-dependent magnetism. As proof-of-concept electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, the prepared carbon nanosheets exhibit high activity and stability. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory studies reveal the high activity of Fe-N coordination sites in the presence of 5/7-membered carbon ring-based topological defects in the carbon skeleton. Taken together, this work provides a new method of synthesizing high-entropy carbons using azulene-based high-entropy molecule as precursor and paves the way toward high-efficiency SACs with rich topological defects for energy conversion.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.131320
Engineering the coordination environment in atomic Fe/Ni dual-sites for efficient oxygen electrocatalysis in Zn-air and Mg-air batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Rational design the single atomic catalyst with excellent activity, stability and high exposure of active sites is a significant challenge. Here, we report an atomically dispersed iron and nickel co-anchored on defect-rich porous nitrogen and sulfur carbon frameworks (denoted as Fe, Ni-SAs/DNSC) with tailored coordination environment, The Fe, Ni-SAs/DNSC electrocatalyst displays outstanding catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with an onset potential (Eonset) of 1.03 V (vs. RHE), half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.88 V (vs. RHE) as well as superior stability. The catalyst also shows a superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. When Fe, Ni-SAs/DNSC catalyst is employed as an air cathode, the Zn-air battery displays superior performance with a large peak power density of 160 mW cm−2, high energy density of 962.8 Wh kgZn-1 and cycling stability. Also, the Fe, Ni-SAs/DNSC-based liquid and flexible solid-state Mg-air batteries deliver a large peak power density of 76 mW cm−2, high energy density of 1653 Wh kgMg–1 and superior durability (Over 78 h at 20 mA cm−1).

Carbon dots/PtW6O24 composite as efficient and stable electrocatalyst for hydrogen oxidation reaction in PEMFCs,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Platinum (Pt) is practical available candidate for satisfying the requirements of anode catalysts in the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Totally dispersed Pt is an ideal way to minimize Pt use, and the develop of Pt-single-atom based hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts should be carried out in a multi-component/-function model system with a clear active site (Pt-single-atom) geometric structure. This work combines the well-defined Na6[H2PtW6O24] clusters and multi-function carbon dots (CDs) to show the highly efficient Pt-single-atom catalyst design for HOR in acid. The mass activity and exchange current density of POMs/CDs (2.18 wt% Pt) achieved 86.72 A mgpt−1 and 3.78 A mgpt−1, respectively, which were 9.5 and 14 times that of 20% Pt/C. Also, this catalyst exhibits better performance than 20% Pt/C in the test of single cell, including higher open circuit potential (OCP), higher power density and better long-time stability. In particular, CDs can effectively improve the catalytic performance of POMs by enhancing the electron acquisition ability of Pt in POMs, the conductivity of composites, the structure stability, the ability to resist toxicity and accelerating the transfer of H+ produced on POMs.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.130709
Single-atom catalysts on supported silicomolybdic acid for CO2 electroreduction: a DFT prediction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way to convert CO2 into fuels which relies on efficient catalysts due to extreme reaction activation barriers. As a new frontier in the field of catalysis, single-atom catalysts (SACs) play an important role in the CO2RR owing to their maximum atomic availability and unique properties. Herein, a new type of electrocatalyst combining transition metal (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag and Cd) with α-Keggin type Na4[SiMo12O40] (Na4SiMo12) was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Through comprehensive screening, TM@Na4SiMo12 (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb and Cd) have been found to exhibit robust stability. Among them, TM@Na4SiMo12 (TM = Sc, Cr, Mn, Ti, and V) have excellent catalytic activity for the CO2RR; in particular, the limiting potential (UL) for CO2RR by Cr@Na4SiMo12 is −0.23 V and the product is HCOOH. Meanwhile, Mn@Na4SiMo12 has high CO2RR selectivity and good catalytic performance (UL = −0.48 V). During the electrochemical CO2RR, polyoxometalates (POMs) act as “electron sponges”, accepting and donating electrons. It is expected that the present work will spur the development of new SACs for the CO2RR.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta08285j
A theoretical study of the electrochemical reduction of CO2on cerium dioxide supported palladium single atoms and nanoparticles,"© the Owner Societies.Pd/CeO2 catalysts show superior catalytic performance owing to their optimal cycling activity and stability. In this study, single-atom Pd and eight-atom Pd nanoparticle clusters were supported on the surface of CeO2(110) to investigate the effect of loaded-metal size on the catalytic performance of the Pd-CeO2 system for CO2 reduction. We investigated the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) that produces C1 products (CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, and CH4) on Pd8/CeO2 and Pd/CeO2 by density functional theory. The structures, CO2 adsorption configurations, and CO2 reduction mechanisms of these two electrocatalysts were systematically studied. Subsequently, different reduction pathways on Pd8/CeO2 and Pd/CeO2 were investigated to identify the optimal reaction pathway for further assessment. The results showed that both of these catalysts are more selective towards the production of CH3OH than CH4. Moreover, compared to Pd/CeO2 and Pd4/CeO2 (from a previously reported study) the production of CH3OH via the CRR on Pd8/CeO2 exhibited the lowest limiting potential. These results demonstrate the superiority of Pd8/CeO2 as an electrocatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH3OH. This journal is",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d1cp03835d
Single-Atom Platinum Implanted on Manganese Dioxide Boosted the High-Rate Performance of Cathodes for Zinc-Ion Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) as electrocatalysts used in metal-air batteries have attracted extensive attention due to their uniform active sites, maximum atomic utilization, and special electrochemical characteristics. In this work, we prepare Pt-MnO2 by implanting single-atom platinum on MnO2 as the cathode material of aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ARZIBs) through thermostatic electrochemical deposition for the first time. Extended X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) analyses prove that platinum is in the form of single atoms. Pt-MnO2 has excellent rate performance, which can maintain a capacity of 264 mA h g-1 at 800 mA g-1. We find the doping of single-atom Pt can enhance electron conductivity by virtue of the low occupancy of the Pt 5d orbital and promote zinc-ion diffusion to a great extent under the heterogeneous metal-support interaction. This study will provide a novel idea for the application of single-atom doping in the field of cathode materials for ARZIBs.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c08418
Atomically-dispersed NiN4-Cl active sites with axial Ni-Cl coordination for accelerating electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) regulated by heteroatoms have displayed great potential as electrocatalysts for highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); however, the controllable synthesis of an axial coordination structure of SACs to achieve robust HER performance remains a great challenge. Herein, we have proposed a doping-adsorption-pyrolysis strategy to construct NiN4-Cl active sites with axial Cl coordination for accelerating electrocatalytic HER. The obtained NiN4-Cl SAs/NC catalyst exhibits superior HER activity with low over-potential, small Tafel slope, high turnover frequency, and long-term stability. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the excellent HER performance of NiN4-Cl SAs/NC originates from the axial Cl-coordination-induced electronic localization enhancement, which is beneficial for the adsorption and activation of H* intermediate, thus accelerating the HER process. This work opens a new opportunity for rational design and construction of high-performance SAC catalysts by axial coordination strategy for electrocatalytic application.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta08287f
A single-atom Cu-N2catalyst eliminates oxygen interference for electrochemical sensing of hydrogen peroxide in a living animal brain,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays essential roles in various physiological and pathological processes. The electrochemical hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) has been recognized as an efficient approach to H2O2 sensing; however, the HPRR has always suffered from low tolerance against the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), resulting in poor selectivity of the HPRR-based sensing platform. In this study, we find that the electrochemical HPRR occurs preferentially compared to the ORR when isolated Cu atoms anchored on carbon nitride (Cu1/C3N4) are used as a single-atom electrocatalyst, which is theoretically attributed to the lower energy barrier of the HPRR than that of the ORR on a Cu1/C3N4 single-atom catalyst (SAC). With the Cu1/C3N4 SAC as the electrocatalyst, we fabricated microsensors that have a good response to H2O2, but not to O2 or other electroactive neurochemicals. When implanted into a living rat brain, the microsensor shows excellent in vivo sensing performance, enabling its application in real-time quantitative investigation of the dynamics of H2O2 production induced by mercaptosuccinate and glutathione monoethyl ester in a living animal brain.

"Hybrid heterojunction of molybdenum disulfide/single cobalt atoms anchored nitrogen, sulfur-doped carbon nanotube /cobalt disulfide with multiple active sites for highly efficient hydrogen evolution","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.A multicomponent 3D monolithic electrode was designed that consists of Co single atoms anchored/nitrogen, sulfur co-doped carbon nanotubes (CoSAs-NS-CNTs) on carbon cloth (CC) with ultra-thin MoS2 nanosheets externally decorated and ultra-small CoS2 nanodots internally confined (MoS2/CoSAs-NS-CNTs@CoS2/CC) to form a hybrid heterojunction electrode with double interfaces as vectorial electron transport pathways for promoting electrocatalytic performance. The integration of well-distributed MoS2 nanosheets and CoS2 nanodots linked with Co single atoms anchored/N, S co-doped CNTs endows abundant multiple active sites, outstanding conductivity, and the downshifted d-band center with a thermodynamically favorable hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) for effectively catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, the optimal MoS2/CoSAs-NS-CNTs@CoS2/CC electrode exhibits outstanding HER performance with overpotentials of 72 and 56 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and small Tafel slopes of 59.4 and 43.2 mV dec-1 in acidic and alkaline solutions, respectively, outperforming most of the previously reported molybdenum/cobalt sulfide-based electrocatalysts. Moreover, the electrode also displays good durability and stability reflected from the small decrease on activity after 5000 CV cycles and nearly no decay in current density after electrolysis for 20 h.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120630
Single atom Ru doping 2H-MoS2 as highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst in a wide pH range,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.It's a huge challenge to develop a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst with a wide pH range. Herein, single atom ruthenium-doped molybdenum disulfide with high 2H phase content (Ru@2H-MoS2) catalysts are synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method, they are named as Ru0.05@2H-MoS2, Ru0.10@2H-MoS2 and Ru0.12@2H-MoS2 based on the amount of Ru (mmol) added to 2H-MoS2. The results indicate that single atom Ru substituting for molybdenum atom leads to more active centers and some vacancies, thus improving the property of 2H-MoS2 for HER. Among them, Ru0.10@2H-MoS2 shows the lowest HER overpotentials of 137, 51 and 168 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M PBS, 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The density functional theory (DFT) further indicates that the Ru@2H-MoS2 has a lower Gibbs free energy of H-adsorption (ΔGH*). Therefore, this study offers an effective way to reasonably design and synthesize efficient MoS2-based catalysts in a wide pH range.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120490
Identification of single-atom-anchored g-CN as pH universal photo- and electro- catalysts for hydrogen evolution,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdIdentifying efficient and low-cost catalysts for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical for renewable energies, yet it remains an immense challenge. Through density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the great potential of 30 single-atom catalysts (SACs), namely single-atom-anchored g-CN (M/g-CN), toward electrocatalytic and photocatalytic HER in all pH intervals. Through Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) calculations, electrical conductivity as well as water dissociation kinetic analysis, six M/g-CN (M = Sc, Ti, V, Ga, Sn, Au) are identified as pH universal electrocatalysts for HER. After excluding the influence of charge and solvation on ΔGH*, M/g-CN (M = V, Ga, Sn, Au) can still be regarded as potential pH universal electrocatalysts for HER. In addition, by combination of band structures with ΔGH* assessments, five M/g-CN (M = Ti, Ni, Ru, Pd, Os) are expected to be pH universal photocatalysts for HER. In particular, Ti/g-CN and Pd/g-CN possess favorable solar light harvesting and proton reducing kinetics, which can be regarded as the essential photo-electro integrated catalysts for HER. Moreover, employing machine learning method, the activity origin for HER on SACs is unveiled, and it is demonstrated that the charge transfer plays the decisive impact accompanied by the synergy effect from a series of structural characteristics. This work gives a new approach to design and search potential HER catalysts.",Applied Materials Today,10.1016/j.apmt.2021.101177
"Facile synthesis of Co, N enriched carbon nanotube and active site identifications for bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution catalysis","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The carbon-based electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air battery not only needs bifunctional activities to oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, but also requires a high graphitization degree to maintain an excellent stability. Herein, a simple and scale-up strategy is developed to synthesize a highly active and stable electrocatalyst (Co@N-CNT) through a solid-state thermal conversion process, derived from a single and easy-to-get precursor (cobaltic Prussian blue analogue). The Co particles trapped inside the tips are the growth sites of the carbon nanotubes and greatly improve the catalytic activity. This kind of special structure helps Co@N-CNT to achieve remarkable bifunctional activities comparable to the noble metal counterparts and superior durability. Interestingly, Co@N-CNT is proved to have no single-atom Co sites on the carbon nanotube. In combination with electrochemical tests, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, Co@graphitic N-C is considered to be the best ORR active site while Co@pyridinic N-C is the best OER active site.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2021.09.009
Single-atom dispersed Cu or Co on 2H-MoS2 monolayer for improving electrocatalytic activity of overall water splitting,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Low-cost but high-performance electrocatalysts based on free-noble metals for overall water splitting are crucial for the clean energy production. By density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explored the possibility of using single-atom dispersed Cu or Co on two-dimensional (4 × 4 × 1) 2H-MoS2 monolayer (Cu@2H-MoS2 and Co@2H-MoS2) to activate the inert basal planes of 2H-MoS2 and to realize overall water splitting reaction. Our results reveal that Cu@2H-MoS2 and Co@2H-MoS2 can significantly alter surface charge distribution and electronic band structure of 2H-MoS2, and Gibbs free-energies of adsorbed H and O species on 2H-MoS2. As a result, the incorporation of Cu or Co single atoms can activate inert in-plane S-atoms, and lead to the improved electrochemical activity for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Relatively, Co@2H-MoS2 exhibits better performance for HER with smaller Gibbs free energy of the hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH=0.08 eV), which is comparable to (4 × 4 × 1) Pt (111) surface (ΔGH= -0.22 eV). Compared to pristine 2H-MoS2 or Co@2H-MoS2, the catalytic activity of Cu@2H-MoS2 for OER is considerably improved with a reduced overpotential of 1.25 eV and a lower energy barrier. This study provides a design route for constructing high-performance single-atom catalysts for the overall water splitting.",Surfaces and Interfaces,10.1016/j.surfin.2021.101538
A pH-universal ORR catalyst with single-atom iron sites derived from a double-layer MOF for superior flexible quasi-solid-state rechargeable Zn-air batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Developing a highly efficient, easy-to-fabricate and non-noble metal electrocatalyst is vital for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we fabricate a single Fe site catalyst Fe1/d-CN by developing a double-layer MOF strategy. The Fe1/d-CN catalyst shows an excellent ORR activity in the pH-universal range, especially in alkaline electrolytes with a record-level half-wave potential of 0.950 V, exceeding those of almost all the reported non-noble electrocatalysts and the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.863 V). Besides its exceptional ORR activity in alkaline electrolytes, it also exhibits comparable ORR activity to the commercial Pt/C catalyst in acidic and neutral electrolytes. We speculate that the sources of the excellent pH-universal ORR performance can be attributed to the regulation of the electronic structure of Fe centres and the excellent electron/proton transport capability that comes from the rich defects and hierarchical porous features of the Fe1/d-CN catalyst. More excitingly, the catalyst possesses remarkable durability, and exhibits a negligible decrease after 30k accelerated durability test (ADT) cycles in pH-universal media. The flexible quasi-solid-state alkaline rechargeable Zn-air batteries with the Fe1/d-CN catalyst as the cathode show superior performance such as a high OCV of 1.50 V and peak power density of 78.0 mW cm-2. Furthermore, the flexible quasi-solid-state neutral rechargeable Zn-air batteries also exhibited remarkable performance. This journal is",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/d1ee01602d
Electrocatalytic performance of Mn-adsorbed g-C3N4: A first-principles study,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Single-atom catalysts with magnetic elements as the active center have been widely exploited as efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Here, different contents of transition metal atom Mn adsorbed on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) were investigated for OER properties by first-principles calculations. Based on the Gibbs free energy, 2Mn-C3N4 possesses higher OER properties, and has a lower over-potential (1.22 V) than Mn-C3N4 (2.42 V). 2Mn-C3N4 has moderate absorption energies for OH and OOH, which benefits the first one-electron reaction and the O2 desorption during the OER. Additionally, by analyzing the partial density of states and projected crystal orbital Hamilton population, the anti-bonding states become less occupied and the adsorption strength of OH is enhanced in 2Mn-C3N4. Thus, the adsorptive strength of 2Mn-C3N4 for OH is stronger than that of Mn-C3N4, which causes 2Mn-C3N4 to show a higher OER activity. The metal-support interaction can alter the local electronic characteristics. The interaction between the metal active center and the reaction intermediates can influence the OER performance, where the specific orbital hybridization plays an important role. Therefore, our results provide a primary understanding of the influence of orbital hybridization intensity on effective OER catalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta07286b
Theoretical Prediction of a Bi-Doped β-Antimonene Monolayer as a Highly Efficient Photocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction and Overall Water Splitting,"© 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.The photo-/electrocatalysts with high activities for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are of significance for the advancement of photo-/electrochemical energy systems such as solar energy to resolve the global energy crisis, reversible water electrolyzers, metal-air batteries, and fuel cells. In the present work, we have systematically investigated the photochemical performance of the 2D β-antimonene (β-Sb) monolayer. From density functional theory investigations, β-Sb with single-atom doping possesses a trifunctional photocatalyst with high energetics and thermal stabilities. In particular, it is predicted that the performance of the HER activity of β-Sb will be superior to most of the 2D materials. Specifically, β-Sb with single atom replacement has even superior that the reference catalysts IrO2(110) and Pt(111) with relatively low overpotential values for ORR and OER mechanisms. The superior catalytic performance of β-Sb has been described by its electronic structures, charge transfer mechanism, and suitable valence and conduction band edge positions versus normal hydrogen electrode. Meanwhile, the low overpotential of multifunctional photocatalysts of the Bi@β-Sb monolayer makes them show a remarkable performance in overall water splitting (0.06 V for HER, 0.25 V for OER, and 0.31 V for ORR). In general, the Bi@β-Sb monolayer may be an excellent trifunctional catalyst that exhibits high activity toward all electrode reactions of hydrogen and oxygen.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c18191
Atomic level engineering of noble metal nanocrystals for energy conversion catalysis,"© 2021It is commonly known that the performance of electrocatalysts is largely influenced by the size, morphology, composition, and crystalline phase of noble metal nanocrystals. However, the limited reserves and high cost of noble metals largely restrict their industrial applications. Along with the development of characterization techniques, theoretical calculations, and advanced material synthesis methods, modulating the electrocatalytic properties of noble metal nanocrystals at the atomic scale (e.g., monolayer/sub-monolayer, single-atom alloy, ultrafine structure) has been flooding out. Engineering noble metal nanocrystals at the atomic level could not only immensely improve the noble metal atom utilization efficiency and lower the cost, but also boost the catalytic performance. In this review, we summarize the recent advanced progresses of regulating the noble metal nanocrystals at the atomic scale towards energy conversion application. Then, the challenges and perspectives of designing noble metal nanocrystals at the atomic scale in the future are discussed and considered. It is expected that this review will inspire scientists to further study precious metal-based materials for energy-oriented catalysis.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.08.039
Fast synthesis of Pt single-atom catalyst with high intrinsic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction by plasma sputtering,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdPlatinum-based materials are identified as the most effective electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. However, the scarcity and high cost of platinum (Pt) have limited its wide application. Therefore, catalysts with low loading but high intrinsic activity can promote the wide application of Pt. In this work, we creatively applied plasma sputtering to deposit Pt single atoms on TiO2−X as an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. The catalyst shows high intrinsic activity and superior stability in acid media, with high turnover frequency (38.9H2 s−1) and mass-specific activity (39.1 A/mg Pt) at 50 mV (vs. RHE) overpotential in 0.5 M H2SO4 that are respectively 3.3 and 11.04 times greater than those of the commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst. In particular, the plasma sputtering method used in this work can shorten the synthesis period of the catalyst to ‘minutes’ or even ‘seconds.’ This work provides guidance and inspiration for the fast synthesis of catalysts with high intrinsic activity for various applications.",Materials Today Energy,10.1016/j.mtener.2021.100877
Single-atom catalysts with anionic metal centers: Promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction and beyond,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesOngoing efforts to develop single-atom catalysts (SACs) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) typically focus on SACs with cationic metal centers, while SACs with anionic metal centers (anionic SACs) have been generally neglected. However, anionic SACs may offer excellent active sites for ORR, since anionic metal centers could facilitate the activation of O2 by back donating electrons to the antibonding orbitals of O2. In this work, we propose a simple guideline for designing anionic SACs: the metal centers should have larger electronegativity than the surrounding atoms in the substrate on which the metal atoms are supported. By means of density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we identified 13 anionic metal centers (Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, and Hg) dispersed on pristine or defective antimonene substrates as new anionic SACs, among which anionic Au and Co metal centers exhibit limiting potentials comparable to, or even better than, conventional Pt-based catalysts towards ORR. We also found that anionic Os and Re metal centers on the defective antimonene can electrochemically catalyze the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) with a limiting potential close to that of stepped Ru(0001). Overall, our work shows promise towards the rational design of anionic SACs and their utility for applications as electrocatalysts for ORR and other important electrochemical reactions.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.08.004
On the evaluation of hydrogen evolution reaction performance of metal-nitrogen-doped carbon electrocatalysts using machine learning technique,"© 2021, The Author(s).Single-atom catalysts (SACs) introduce as a promising category of electrocatalysts, especially in the water-splitting process. Recent studies have exhibited that nitrogen-doped carbon-based SACs can act as a great HER electrocatalyst. In this regard, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference optimized by Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) method was used to predict hydrogen adsorption energy (ΔG) obtained from density functional theory (DFT) for single transition-metal atoms including Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au embedded in N-doped carbon of different sizes. Various descriptors such as the covalent radius, Zunger radius of the atomic d-orbital, the formation energy of the single-atom site, ionization energy, electronegativity, the d-band center from − 6 to 6 eV, number of valence electrons, Bader charge, number of occupied d states from 0 to − 2 eV, and number of unoccupied d states from 0 to 2 eV were chosen as input parameters based on sensitivity analysis. The R-squared and MSE of the developed model were 0.967 and 0.029, respectively, confirming its great accuracy in determining hydrogen adsorption energy of metal/NC electrocatalysts.",Scientific Reports,10.1038/s41598-021-00031-0
Late Transition Metal Doped MXenes Showing Superb Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Activities for Water Splitting via Distinctive Mechanistic Pathways,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHMXenes have been widely used as substrates of hybrid electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their stability and metallic properties. However, tuning MXenes towards superb hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) activity has remained elusive. Using first-principles calculations along with machine learning (ML) based descriptors, it is shown that late transition metal doping is able to significantly promote HER/OER activities. Both single-atom adsorption onto a stable hollow site above the outer oxygen layer single-atom catalyst 1 (SAC1), and single-atom replacement at a sub-surface metal layer (SAC2) are considered. An adsorbate evolving mechanism (AEM) is preferred for SAC1, while the increased M-O bond covalency for SAC2 makes lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) favored. It is found that a single Ni or Co atom embedded into MXenes provides a suitable number of electrons for optimal AEM and raises the O 2p band towards activated LOM. The stability and superb bifunctional catalytic capability of MXene combinations (Ni-doped Sc3N2O2 and Ni-doped Nb3C2O2) towards both HER and OER are demonstrated. The electronic and geometric descriptors used in the ML analysis work universally for classification of high-performing HER/OER catalysts. This work provides a rational strategy for promoting bifunctional electrocatalytic activities based on low-cost MXenes metals.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202102388
MOF Structure Engineering to Synthesize Co-N-C Catalyst with Richer Accessible Active Sites for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle-atom cobalt-based Co-N-C are promising low-cost electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, further increasing the single cobalt-based active sites and the ORR activity remain a major challenge. Herein, an acetate (OAc) assisted metal–organic framework (MOF) structure-engineering strategy is developed to synthesize hierarchical accordion-like MOF with higher loading amount and better spatial isolation of Co and much higher yield when compared with widely reported polyhedron MOF. After pyrolysis, the accordion-structured Co-N-C (Co-N-C (A)) is loaded with denser Co-N4 active sites (Co: 2.88 wt%), approximately twice that of Co in the Co-N-C reported. The presence of OAc in MOF also induces the generation of big pores (5–50 nm) for improving the accessibility of active sites and mass transfer during catalytic reactions. Consequently, the Co-N-C (A) catalyst shows an admirable ORR activity with a E1/2 of 0.89 V (40 mV better than Pt/C) in alkaline electrolytes, outstanding durability, and absolute tolerance to methanol in both alkaline and acidic media. The Co-N-C-based Zn-air battery exhibits a high specific capacity (976 mAh g−1Zn), power density (158 mW cm−2), rate capability, and long-term stability. This work demonstrates a reliable approach to construct single atom doped carbon catalysts with denser accessible active sites through MOF structure engineering.",Small,10.1002/smll.202104684
Size effect of metal–organic frameworks with iron single-atom catalysts on oxygen–reduction reactions,"© 2021, Korean Carbon Society.Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used as supports for single-atom catalysts (SACs) owing to their high specific surface area, porosity, and ordered metal–ligand structure. Their activity can be increased by increasing the number of electrochemically accessible active sites via the formation of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (M–Nx) that coordinate with nitrogen atoms on the MOF. Herein, we introduce the relationship between the size of the MOF as a starting material and the catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media. The morphology and features of the MOFs are critically dependent on their size. Remarkably, cage-like MOFs below 33 nm are converted into collapsed structures and are connected between each MOF, even carbon fiber- or tube-like features, after carbonization. SACs derived from medium-sized MOFs exhibit excellent activity and are comparable to commercial Pt/C catalysts owing to their porous structure. Therefore, we believed that controlling the size of MOFs containing active atoms is an effective method of modulating the morphological properties of the support and even the number of active sites that are closely related to the activity.",Carbon Letters,10.1007/s42823-021-00292-9
Functionalized Iron–Nitrogen–Carbon Electrocatalyst Provides a Reversible Electron Transfer Platform for Efficient Uranium Extraction from Seawater,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHUranium extraction from seawater provides an opportunity for sustainable fuel supply to nuclear power plants. Herein, an adsorption–electrocatalysis strategy is demonstrated for efficient uranium extraction from seawater using a functionalized iron–nitrogen–carbon (Fe–Nx–C–R) catalyst, comprising N-doped carbon capsules supporting FeNx single-atom sites and surface chelating amidoxime groups (R). The amidoxime groups bring hydrophilicity to the adsorbent and offer surface-specific binding sites for UO22+ capture. The site-isolated FeNx centres reduce adsorbed UO22+ to UO2+. Subsequently, through electrochemical reduction of the FeNx sites, unstable U(V) ions are reoxidized to U(VI) in the presence of Na+ resulting in the generation of solid Na2O(UO3·H2O)x, which can easily be collected. Fe–Nx–C–R reduced the uranium concentration in seawater from ≈3.5 ppb to below 0.5 ppb with a calculated capacity of ≈1.2 mg g-1 within 24 h. To the best of the knowledge, the developed system is the first to use the adsorption of uranyl ions and electrodeposition of solid Na2O(UO3.H2O)x for the extraction of uranium from seawater. The important discoveries guide technology development for the efficient extraction of uranium from seawater.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202106621
Tuning the p-Orbital Electron Structure of s-Block Metal Ca Enables a High-Performance Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHMost previous efforts are devoted to developing transition metals as electrocatalysts guided by the d-band center model. The metals of the s-block of the periodic table have so far received little attention in the application of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Herein, a carbon catalyst with calcium (Ca) single atom coordinated with N and O is reported, which displays exceptional ORR activities in both acidic condition (E1/2 = 0.77 V, 0.1 m HClO4) and alkaline condition (E1/2 = 0.90 V, 0.1 m KOH). The Ca-N, O/C exhibits remarkable performance in zinc–air battery with a maximum power density of 218 mW cm–2, superior to a series of catalysts reported so far. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) characterization confirms the formation of N- and O-atom-coordinated Ca in the carbon matrix. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the high catalytic activity of main-group Ca is ascribed to the fact that its p-orbital electron structure is regulated by N and O coordination so that the highest peak (EP) of the projected density of states (PDOS) for the Ca atom is moved close to the Fermi level, thereby facilitating the adsorption of ORR intermediates and electron transfer.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202107103
Boosting the activity of non-platinum group metal electrocatalyst for the reduction of oxygen via dual-ligated atomically dispersed precursors immobilized on carbon supports,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThis paper describes the use of both atomically dispersed precursors (ADPs) and conductive carbon dispersion towards the synthesis of iron-based single atom electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). For non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts, single iron, cobalt or manganese atoms coordinated with nitrogen are the most active structures towards the ORR. Achieving a high density of active sites made of single atoms is still challenging, requiring careful controls of pyrolysis to reduce the sintering of metal active sites. Herewith, we present a new strategy to synthesize iron-based single atom ORR electrocatalysts using a two-pronged approach. We first designed a dual-ligated metal organic framework (MOF) precursor. This MOF was then immobilized onto Ketjen black carbon that serves as a conductive dispersion medium for creating the highly dispersed single atom sites. We demonstrate a near complete dispersion of the iron sites without obvious formation of nanoparticles. The activity of the resulting electrocatalyst exhibited an onset potential of 0.96 V and a half-wave potential of 0.84 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106547
Mechanistic insight into the active centers of single/dual-atom Ni/Fe-based oxygen electrocatalysts,"© 2021, The Author(s).Single-atom catalysts with maximum metal utilization efficiency show great potential for sustainable catalytic applications and fundamental mechanistic studies. We here provide a convenient molecular tailoring strategy based on graphitic carbon nitride as support for the rational design of single-site and dual-site single-atom catalysts. Catalysts with single Fe sites exhibit impressive oxygen reduction reaction activity with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V vs. RHE. We find that the single Ni sites are favorable to promote the key structural reconstruction into bridging Ni-O-Fe bonds in dual-site NiFe SAC. Meanwhile, the newly formed Ni-O-Fe bonds create spin channels for electron transfer, resulting in a significant improvement of the oxygen evolution reaction activity with an overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm−2. We further reveal that the water oxidation reaction follows a dual-site pathway through the deprotonation of *OH at both Ni and Fe sites, leading to the formation of bridging O2 atop the Ni-O-Fe sites.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-021-25811-0
Copper-catalysed exclusive CO2 to pure formic acid conversion via single-atom alloying,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.Converting CO2 emissions, powered by renewable electricity, to produce fuels and chemicals provides an elegant route towards a carbon-neutral energy cycle. Progress in the understanding and synthesis of Cu catalysts has spurred the explosive development of electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) technology to produce hydrocarbons and oxygenates; however, Cu, as the predominant catalyst, often exhibits limited selectivity and activity towards a specific product, leading to low productivity and substantial post-reaction purification. Here, we present a single-atom Pb-alloyed Cu catalyst (Pb1Cu) that can exclusively (~96% Faradaic efficiency) convert CO2 into formate with high activity in excess of 1 A cm–2. The Pb1Cu electrocatalyst converts CO2 into formate on the modulated Cu sites rather than on the isolated Pb. In situ spectroscopic evidence and theoretical calculations revealed that the activated Cu sites of the Pb1Cu catalyst regulate the first protonation step of the CO2RR and divert the CO2RR towards a HCOO* path rather than a COOH* path, thus thwarting the possibility of other products. We further showcase the continuous production of a pure formic acid solution at 100 mA cm–2 over 180 h using a solid electrolyte reactor and Pb1Cu.",Nature Nanotechnology,10.1038/s41565-021-00974-5
Stone-Wales defect-rich carbon-supported dual-metal single atom sites for Zn-air batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThis work aims to obtain a fundamental understanding of active sites near stone-wales (SW) defects rich nitrogen-doped graphene (DG) with specific coordination of carbon atom rings. It reveals that the SW rich defects (e.g., pentagon (5), pentagon—octagon—pentagon (i.e. 585), or pentagon-heptagon-heptagon-pentagon (5775) rings, appears correspondingly with carbon rings that brought active sites during catalytic reactions. Moreover, we anchored dual isolated metallic atoms (Ni/Fe) on DG support via linkers (O/N) called NiFe-DG. X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates Ni/Fe metal single atoms are embedded via Fe-N4 and Ni-N4 coordination on DG surfaces. It exhibits high catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with an onset potential of 0.97 V, a half-wave potential of 0.86 V, and diffusion current density of 5.7 mA cm− 2, which is at par with commercial Pt/C. The catalyst shows superior stability, retained 82% of the initial current density even after 12 h under an applied potential of 0.86 V. Similarly, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 358 mV was achieved at 10 mA cm− 2 with a lower Tafel slope value (76 mV/dec) than commercial Pt/C. It maintains 85% stability for 12 h at a constant potential of 1.588 V, shows better stability than commercial Pt/C.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106488
Ru-Pincer Complex-Bridged Cu-Porphyrin Polymer for Robust (Photo)Electrocatalytic H2 Evolution via Single-Atom Active Sites,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHOrganic polymers have attracted much attention in the field of energy conversion owing to their excellent tailoring ability via heterometal incorporation and/or functionalization. Herein, a novel pincer complex-bridged porphyrin polymer is synthesized using Cu-porphyrin (CuPor) and Ru-N′NN′-pincer complex (RuN3) as monomers. The resultant CuPor-RuN3 polymer delivers robust electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with outstanding durability and ultralow overpotentials of 73 and 114 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. Moreover, the CuPor-RuN3 polymer displays great potential to fabricate photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells with a BiVO4 photoanode, where the additional photoinduced electrons from CuPor-RuN3 endow the BiVO4||CuPor-RuN3 PEC cell with much better activity for overall water splitting than the BiVO4||Pt/C one, demonstrating that CuPor-RuN3 would be a promising (photo)electrocatalyst to replace the benchmark Pt/C. The experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the Cu/Ru heterobimetallic centers in the polymer not only enhance the inherent electron transfer from Cu sites to Ru ones that serve as single-atom catalytic sites (Ru-N3), but also efficiently regulate the electronic property of the Ru-N3 sites, and thus boosting (photo)electrocatalytic HER activity. The proposed strategy opens a new avenue to fabricate porphyrin-based polymers with heteromultimetallic centers as effective HER (photo)electrocatalysts.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202107290
A New Strategy for Accelerating Dynamic Proton Transfer of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction at High Current Densities,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHDeveloping single-atom electrocatalysts with high activity and superior selectivity at a wide potential window for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) still remains a great challenge. Herein, a porous Ni-N-C catalyst containing atomically dispersed Ni-N4 sites and nanostructured zirconium oxide (ZrO2@Ni-NC) synthesized via a post-synthetic coordination coupling carbonization strategy is reported. The as-prepared ZrO2@Ni-NC exhibits an initial potential of −0.3 V, maximum CO Faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of 98.6% ± 1.3, and a low Tafel slope of 71.7 mV dec−1 in electrochemical CO2RR. In particular, a wide potential window from −0.7 to −1.4 V with CO F.E. of above 90% on ZrO2@Ni-NC far exceeds those of recently developed state-of-the-art CO2RR electrocatalysts based on Ni-N moieties anchored carbon. In a flow cell, ZrO2@Ni-NC delivers a current density of 200 mA cm−2 with a superior CO selectivity of 96.8% at −1.58 V in a practical scale. A series of designed experiments and structural analyses identify that the isolated Ni-N4 species act as real active sites to drive the CO2RR reaction and that the nanostructured ZrO2 largely accelerates the protonation process of *CO2− to *COOH intermediate, thus significantly reducing the energy barrier of this rate-determining step and boosting whole catalytic performance.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202104243
Engineering single-atomic ruthenium catalytic sites on defective nickel-iron layered double hydroxide for overall water splitting,"© 2021, The Author(s).Rational design of single atom catalyst is critical for efficient sustainable energy conversion. However, the atomic-level control of active sites is essential for electrocatalytic materials in alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, well-defined surface structures lead to in-depth understanding of catalytic mechanisms. Herein, we report a single-atomic-site ruthenium stabilized on defective nickel-iron layered double hydroxide nanosheets (Ru1/D-NiFe LDH). Under precise regulation of local coordination environments of catalytically active sites and the existence of the defects, Ru1/D-NiFe LDH delivers an ultralow overpotential of 18 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for hydrogen evolution reaction, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Ru1/D-NiFe LDH optimizes the adsorption energies of intermediates for hydrogen evolution reaction and promotes the O–O coupling at a Ru–O active site for oxygen evolution reaction. The Ru1/D-NiFe LDH as an ideal model reveals superior water splitting performance with potential for the development of promising water-alkali electrocatalysts.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-021-24828-9

Heteroatom-doped porous carbon-supported single-atom catalysts for electrocatalytic energy conversion,"© 2021 Science PressElectrocatalysts play a crucial role in the development of renewable energy conversion and storage nanotechnologies. The unique advantages of heteroatom-doped porous carbon-supported single-atom electrocatalysts (SAC-HDPCs) are clear. These SAC-HDPCs exhibit outstanding activity, selectivity and stability due to their distinct electronic structure, satisfactory conductivity, controllable porosity and heteroatom-doping effect. Rapid and significant developments involving the synthesis, characterization, and structure-property-function relationship of SAC-HDPCs have been made in recent years. In this review, we describe recent research efforts involving advanced (in situ) characterization techniques, innovative synthetic strategies, and electrochemical energy conversion examples of SAC-HDPCs. The electrocatalytic performance of SAC-HDPCs is further considered at an atomic level, and the mechanisms underlying this performance are also discussed in detail. We expect that these analyses and deductions will be useful for the design of new materials and may help to establish a foundation for the design of future SAC-HDPCs.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.04.041
Folic Acid Self-Assembly Enabling Manganese Single-Atom Electrocatalyst for Selective Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia,"© 2021, The Author(s).Efficient and robust single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on cheap and earth-abundant elements are highly desirable for electrochemical reduction of nitrogen to ammonia (NRR) under ambient conditions. Herein, for the first time, a Mn–N–C SAC consisting of isolated manganese atomic sites on ultrathin carbon nanosheets is developed via a template-free folic acid self-assembly strategy. The spontaneous molecular partial dissociation enables a facile fabrication process without being plagued by metal atom aggregation. Thanks to well-exposed atomic Mn active sites anchored on two-dimensional conductive carbon matrix, the catalyst exhibits excellent activity for NRR with high activity and selectivity, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency of 32.02% for ammonia synthesis at − 0.45 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional theory calculations unveil the crucial role of atomic Mn sites in promoting N2 adsorption, activation and selective reduction to NH3 by the distal mechanism. This work provides a simple synthesis process for Mn–N–C SAC and a good platform for understanding the structure-activity relationship of atomic Mn sites.

Elucidating the electro-catalytic oxidation of hydrazine over carbon nanotube-based transition metal single atom catalysts,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Elucidating the reaction mechanism of hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) over carbon-based catalysts is highly propitious for the rational design of novel electrocatalysts for HzOR. In present work, isolated first-row transition metal atoms have been coordinated with N atoms on the graphite layers of carbon nanotubes via a M-N4-C configuration (MSA/CNT, M=Fe, Co and Ni). The HzOR over the three single atom catalysts follows a predominant 4-electron reaction pathway to emit N2 and a negligible 1-electron pathway to emit trace of NH3, while their electrocatalytic activity for HzOR is dominated by the absorption energy of N2H4 on them. Furthermore, FeSA/CNT reverses the passivation effect on Fe/C and shows superior performance than CoSA/CNT and NiSA/CNT with a recorded high mass activity for HzOR due to the higher electronic charge of Fe over Co and Ni in the M-N4-C configuration and the lowest absorption energy of N2H4 on FeSA/CNT among the three MSA/CNT catalysts.

Carbon nanotube supported bifunctional electrocatalysts containing iron-nitrogen-carbon active sites for zinc-air batteries,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Bifunctional electrocatalysts with high activity toward both oxygen reduction and evolution reaction are highly desirable for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Herein, a kind of carbon nanotube (CNT) supported single-site Fe-N-C catalyst was fabricated via pyrolyzing in-situ grown Fe-containing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks on CNTs. CNTs not only serve as the physical supports of the Fe-N-C active sites but also provide a conductive network to facilitate the fast electron and ion transfer. The as-synthesized catalysts exhibit a half-wave potential of 0.865 V for oxygen reduction reaction and a low overpotential of 0.442 V at 10 mA·cm−2 for oxygen evolution, which is 310 mV smaller than that of Fe-N-C without CNTs. The rechargeable Zn-air batteries fabricated with such hybrid catalysts display a high peak power density of 182 mW·cm−2 and an excellent cycling stability of over 1,000 h at 10 mA·cm−2, which outperforms commercial Pt-C and most of the reported catalysts. This facile strategy of combining single-site Metal-N-C with CNTs network is effective for preparing highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Modulating electronic structure of metal-organic frameworks by introducing atomically dispersed Ru for efficient hydrogen evolution,"© 2021, The Author(s).Developing high-performance electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction is important for clean and sustainable hydrogen energy, yet still challenging. Herein, we report a single-atom strategy to construct excellent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst (NiRu0.13-BDC) by introducing atomically dispersed Ru. Significantly, the obtained NiRu0.13-BDC exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution activity in all pH, especially with a low overpotential of 36 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M phosphate buffered saline solution, which is comparable to commercial Pt/C. X-ray absorption fine structures and the density functional theory calculations reveal that introducing Ru single-atom can modulate electronic structure of metal center in the MOF, leading to the optimization of binding strength for H2O and H*, and the enhancement of HER performance. This work establishes single-atom strategy as an efficient approach to modulate electronic structure of MOFs for catalyst design.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-021-21595-5
Templating Synthesis of Metal–Organic Framework Nanofiber Aerogels and Their Derived Hollow Porous Carbon Nanofibers for Energy Storage and Conversion,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHA kind of metal–organic framework (MOF) aerogels are synthesized by the self-assembly of uniform and monodisperse MOF nanofibers. Such MOF nanofiber aerogels as carbon precursors can effectively avoid the aggregation of nanofibers during calcination, resulting in the formation of well-dispersed hollow porous carbon nanofibers (HPCNs). Moreover, HPCNs with well-dispersion are investigated as sulfur host materials for Li–S batteries and electrocatalysts for cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). On the one hand, HPCNs act as hosts for the encapsulation of sulfur into their hierarchical micro- and mesopores as well as hollow nanostructures. The obtained sulfur cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical features, good cycling stability and high coulombic efficiency. On the other hand, HPCNs exhibit better electrocatalytic activity than aggregated counterparts for ORR. Furthermore, a highly active single atom electrocatalyst can be prepared by the carbonization of bimetallic MOF nanofiber aerogels. The results indicate that well-dispersed HPCNs show enhanced electrochemical properties in contrast to their aggregated counterparts, suggesting that the dispersion situation of nanomaterials significantly influence their final performance. The present concept of employing MOF nanofiber aerogels as precursors will provide a new strategy to the design of MOF-derived nanomaterials with well-dispersion for their applications in energy storage and conversion.",Small,10.1002/smll.202004140
One-step synthesis of single-site vanadium substitution in 1T-WS2 monolayers for enhanced hydrogen evolution catalysis,"© 2021, The Author(s).Metallic tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayers have been demonstrated as promising electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) induced by the high intrinsic conductivity, however, the key challenges to maximize the catalytic activity are achieving the metallic WS2 with high concentration and increasing the density of the active sites. In this work, single-atom-V catalysts (V SACs) substitutions in 1T-WS2 monolayers (91% phase purity) are fabricated to significantly enhance the HER performance via a one-step chemical vapor deposition strategy. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging together with Raman spectroscopy confirm the atomic dispersion of V species on the 1T-WS2 monolayers instead of energetically favorable 2H-WS2 monolayers. The growth mechanism of V SACs@1T-WS2 monolayers is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the activated V-atom sites play vital important role in enhancing the HER activity. In this work, it opens a novel path to directly synthesize atomically dispersed single-metal catalysts on metastable materials as efficient and robust electrocatalysts.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-021-20951-9
Integrating single-cobalt-site and electric field of boron nitride in dechlorination electrocatalysts by bioinspired design,"© 2021, The Author(s).The construction of enzyme-inspired artificial catalysts with enzyme-like active sites and microenvironment remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a single-atomic-site Co catalyst supported by carbon doped boron nitride (BCN) with locally polarized B–N bonds (Co SAs/BCN) to simulate the reductive dehalogenases. Density functional theory analysis suggests that the BCN supports, featured with ionic characteristics, provide additional electric field effect compared with graphitic carbon or N-doped carbon (CN), which could facilitate the adsorption of polarized organochlorides. Consistent with the theoretical results, the Co SAs/BCN catalyst delivers a high activity with nearly complete dechlorination (~98%) at a potential of −0.9 V versus Ag/AgCl for chloramphenicol (CAP), showing that the rate constant (k) contributed by unit mass of metal (k/ratio) is 4 and 19 times more active than those of the Co SAs/CN and state-of-the-art Pd/C catalyst, respectively. We show that Co single atoms coupled with BCN host exhibit high stability and selectivity in CAP dechlorination and suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, endowing the Co SAs/BCN as a candidate for sustainable conversion of organic chloride.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-020-20619-w
Tuning main-group s-block metal Mg as a promising single-atom electrocatalyst for N2 fixation: A DFT study,"© 2021, Editorial Department of Journal of University of Science and Technology of China. All rights reserved.The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) can transform nitrogen and protons from aqueous electrolytes to ammonia by using renewable electricity under ambient conditions, which is a promising technology to replace the Haber-Bosch process. However, this technology is extremely challenging as it requires highly active electrocatalysts to break the stable triple-bonds of N2. With p bands,main-group s-block metals have been rarely explored in NRR compared with transition metals. Herein, we employ first-principles calculations to propose a Mg single atom catalyst as a promising highperformance electrocatalyst for NRR, where Mg atom is coordinated with four oxygen atoms within graphene (Mg-O4). Our results reveal that N2 can be efficiently activated on Mg-O4 and reduced into NH3 through the alternating mechanism. Moreover, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the Mg-O4 structure has high stability.",Journal of University of Science and Technology of China,10.52396/JUST-2021-0126
Conductive two-dimensional M3(C6S3O3)2monolayers as effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Two-dimensional (2D) conjugated metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which feature single atom catalysts are promising electrocatalysts to promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, by means of density functional theory calculations and microkinetics simulations, we designed a new type of 2D MOFs namely monolayers of M3(C6S3O3)2 (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Pd, Rh and Ru) and explored their potential as electrocatalysts for the ORR. All 2D M3(C6S3O3)2 monolayers are metallic because of the effective orbital coupling between the π-conjugated organic linkers (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene-2,4,6-trithiol) and the central metals. The designed structures show good catalytic activities because of the synergistic effect provided by the hybrid organic linkers, and the catalytic performance can be tuned by changing the central metals. Among them, Rh3(C6S3O3)2 outperforms Pt/C by showing a large limiting potential of 0.81 V, while Co3(C6S3O3)2, Fe3(C6S3O3)2 and Mn3(C6S3O3)2 show comparable ORR catalytic activity to Pt/C. Our study provides a new clue for the design of functional 2D MOFs as effective catalysts for the ORR.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta07442c
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide with nearly 100% carbon monoxide faradaic efficiency from vacancy-stabilized single-atom active sites,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been rapidly rising as emerging materials in the field of energy conversion, especially for CO2 reduction reaction. However, the selectivity and running current are still beyond practical applications. Herein, we report new unsaturated SACs with CO2 to CO selectivity of nearly 100% at 51 mA cm-2, and 91% at 100 mA cm-2. Such unsaturated SACs (M-Nx, M = Ni, Fe and Co, x < 4) are rationally prepared through a novel CO2-to-carbon process in large quantity and confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. As electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, unsaturated Ni-N2 centered SACs exhibit outstanding activity for CO2 reduction, outperforming state-of-the-art unsaturated SACs. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculation reveal that such unsaturated Ni sites with rich vacancies are favorable for production of more unpaired 3d electrons, and consequently reduce the free energy for COOH∗ formation, therefore boosting CO2 reduction performance. Not only does this work provide a new method towards unsaturated SACs in large quantity, but also contributes fundamental understanding of the unsaturated single-atom sites in electrochemical catalysis.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta05990d
SnO2-supported single metal atoms: a bifunctional catalyst for the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2,"© The Royal Society of ChemistryOn-site hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production via electrochemical methods, such as two-electron water oxidation reaction (2e-WOR) and two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR), offer an attractive alternative to the anthraquinone oxidation (AO) process. However, for 2e-WOR and 2e-ORR to hold any industrial relevance, inexpensive, stable, highly efficient, selective, and environmentally benign electrocatalysts must be developed. Designing a catalyst to meet such an extensive criterion remains a challenge. Single-atom catalysts (SACs), combining the benefits of heterogenous and homogenous catalysis, have drawn immense attention due to their distinguished catalytic performance. Ergo, we aim towards the exploration of a bifunctional SAC material capable of catalyzing the 2e-WOR and 2e-ORR to produce H2O2. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations we investigate the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of SnO2-supported SACs. Considering 16 different single metal atoms, various promising candidates were identified. Particularly, Mn, Ti and Fe were found to be markedly active and selective 2e-WOR catalysts and W for the 2e-ORR. This work highlights the immense potential of bifunctional systems; a route towards increasing H2O2 yields while simultaneously minimizing manufacturing complexity and cost.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta07562d
Highly Selective Tandem Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethylene over Atomically Isolated Nickel–Nitrogen Site/Copper Nanoparticle Catalysts,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHHerein, an effective tandem catalysis strategy is developed to improve the selectivity of the CO2RR towards C2H4 by multiple distinct catalytic sites in local vicinity. An earth-abundant elements-based tandem electrocatalyst PTF(Ni)/Cu is constructed by uniformly dispersing Cu nanoparticles (NPs) on the porphyrinic triazine framework anchored with atomically isolated nickel–nitrogen sites (PTF(Ni)) for the enhanced CO2RR to produce C2H4. The Faradaic efficiency of C2H4 reaches 57.3 % at −1.1 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is about 6 times higher than the non-tandem catalyst PTF/Cu, which produces CH4 as the major carbon product. The operando infrared spectroscopy and theoretic density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the local high concentration of CO generated by PTF(Ni) sites can facilitate the C−C coupling to form C2H4 on the nearby Cu NP sites. The work offers an effective avenue to design electrocatalysts for the highly selective CO2RR to produce multicarbon products via a tandem route.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202111136
Design of non-transition-metal-doped nanoribbon catalysis to achieve efficient nitrogen fixation,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The high percentage of N2 in the air can provide an abundant nitrogen source for the ammonia industry. However, the nitrogen fixation process still faces great challenges due to the stable nitrogen-nitrogen triple bonds. Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have arguably become the most promising frontier in the synthetic ammonia industry due to their high activity, selectivity and stability. In particular, metal-free catalysis has attracted great attention due to its low-cost and environmentally friendly features. Herein, we investigate a series of nitrogen-reduction reaction (NRR) electrocatalysts as graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) embedded with 16 kinds of non-transition metal single-atom catalysts (non-TMSACs) using density functional theory (DFT) computations. The stability of this system is first confirmed by AIMD simulations and formation energies. Among all the candidates, Si anchored on the GNR system achieves a limiting potential as low as -0.45 V and the binding energy for NNH also serves as a good descriptor for the onset potential. The electronic structure reveals that this design satisfies an ""acceptance-donation""interaction scenario, which is also confirmed by the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) and the spatial charge distribution. This study not only proposes an effective catalysis approach for the NRR, but also emphasizes the origin of electronic structures, which may provide guidance for future NRR catalyst designs.",Materials Advances,10.1039/d1ma00518a
Synthesis of a ruthenium-graphene quantum dot-graphene hybrid as a promising single-atom catalyst for electrochemical nitrogen reduction with ultrahigh yield rate and selectivity,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.It is impossible for the hybrid of classical graphene and metal nanoparticles to break through the limitations of their inherent properties because graphene and metal nanoparticles are conductors. This study reports the synthesis of single atom ruthenium-histidine-functionalized graphene quantum dot-graphene hybrid (Ru-His-GQD-G). His-GQD is immobilized on graphene oxide (GO)viaπ-π stacking and then coordinated with Ru3+ions. This is followed by reduction with ascorbic acid into GO gel and annealing at 400 °C at a slow heating rate of 0.5 °C min−1. The resulting Ru-His-GQD-G shows a well-defined three-dimensional structure with a high Ru loading of 5.1 wt%, in which Ru atoms are evenly dispersed on graphene sheets. The intimate contact between His-GQD and Ru atom and graphene creates double Schottky heterojunctions. Ru-His-GQD-G exhibits ultrahigh catalytic activity for electrochemical nitrogen reduction. At a low potential of −0.05 V, the NH3yield rate reaches 226 μg mg−1h−1with the faradaic efficiency of 42.6%, which is better than that of reported electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction. The experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the Ru sites with His-GQD are the major active centers that permit nitrogen adsorption, stabilization of *NNH and destabilization of *H.

Single-Atom Co Doped in Ultrathin WO3 Arrays for the Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in a Wide pH Range,"© Owing to the scarcity of Pt, low-cost, stable, and efficient nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts that can be applied in a wide pH range for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are urgently required. Herein, a highly efficient and robust HER catalyst that is applicable at all pH values is fabricated, containing isolated Co-single atomic sites anchored in the self-supported WO3 arrays grown on Cu foam. At a current density of 10 mA cm-2, the HER overpotentials are 117, 105, and 149 mV at pH values of 0, 7, and 14, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of the undoped WO3, suggesting superior electrocatalytic H2-evolution activity at all pH values. The catalyst also exhibits long-term stability over a wide pH range, particularly in an acidic medium over 24 h, owing to the excellent anticorrosion properties of WO3. Density functional theory calculations prove that the enhanced HER activity is attributed to the isolated Co sites because these optimize the adsorption energy of H∗ species on WO3. Moreover, the high electrical conductivity of Co-doped WO3 and the three-dimensional array structure supported on the porous metal support afford a catalyst with suitable HER kinetics to enhance the catalytic performance.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c16082

Herein, we explore single-atom nickel (Ni) dispersed N-doped carbon (SA-Ni-NC) as a novel electrocatalyst for catalyzing selective acetylene semihydrogenation. In situ electrochemical Raman and theoretical investigations reveal that weak π-adsorption of ethylene on individual Ni sites in SA-Ni-NC facilitates its desorption and thus avoids its overhydrogenation. Eventually, under pure acetylene flow, SA-Ni-NC exhibits a high ethylene faradaic efficiency (FEethylene) of 91.3% and a large current density of −92.2 mA cm−2 at −0.6 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Even in crude ethylene stream containing 1% acetylene impurities (1 × 104 ppm), SA-Ni-NC still manifests a high acetylene conversion of 97.4% with a large space velocity (SV) of 2.4 × 104 mL gcat−1 h−1 and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 22.9 h−1 for each Ni atom.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta08002d

Atomically dispersed Ni–N4 species and Ni nanoparticles constructing N-doped porous carbon fibers for accelerating hydrogen evolution,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdSingle-atom catalysis has aroused enormous attention due to the highly exposed active sites and nearly 100% atomic utilization. However, the relatively low metal atoms loading limits their catalytic activities. Herein, we report N-doped carbon fibers supported Ni single atoms and nanoparticles hybrid (Ni SA/NP-NCF-800) by the combined strategies comprising electrospinning, pyrolysis, and etching. The in-situ formed SiO2 and Ni particles serve as the hard templates to create highly porous architecture throughout the entire fibers, enabling the Ni species to efficiently anchor on carbon matrix to generate a high single atoms loading of 1.83 wt%, as well as provide accessible channels for mass transport and electrolyte diffusion. The unique configuration endows the hybrid with outstanding hydrogen evolution performance along with the low overpotential and robust long-term durability in 1 M KOH. The synchrotron radiation analysis and density functional theory calculations experimentally and theoretically reveal the isolated Ni was coordinated with neighboring four N atoms, which could lead to the re-arranged electron structure of Ni nanoparticles. The synergistic effect of atomically dispersed Ni and nanoparticles leads to the significantly enhanced water adsorption/dissociation abilities and optimized H adsorption free energy in alkaline media, thus paving a new avenue to design single atoms based electrocatalysts.",Carbon,10.1016/j.carbon.2021.09.030
Dual active site tandem catalysis of metal hydroxyl oxides and single atoms for boosting oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The high voltage in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) often causes structural change in electrocatalysts and forms multiple active sites. Therefore, exploring the synergy of various active sites is extremely significant to develop catalysts for OER with multiple elementary steps. Herein, we adopt the physically adsorbed metal ions method to successfully synthesize a highly-efficient electrocatalyst containing the dual active sites of Fe-NiOOH and NiC4 single atoms (marked as Ni SAs/Fe-NiOOH). The Ni SAs/Fe-NiOOH displays outstanding OER performance with an overpotential of 269 mV to deliver current density of 10 mA/cm2 that shows 55 mV superior to commercial IrO2/CB at the same condition. Experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that the excellent OER activity of Ni SAs/Fe-NiOOH catalyst is attributed to the synergy of dual active sites of NiC4 SAs and Fe-NiOOH. A tandem catalysis mechanism is also proposed to reveal the synergism of two active centers, which makes the potential-determining step more facile and accordingly decreases the OER overpotential. This work offers a new concept of tandem catalysis to develop the electrocatalysts with many elemental steps, like OER and oxygen reduction reaction catalysts.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120451

Herein, the theoretical screening based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations was performed to design the two-dimensional single-atom catalysts (M@2D-FeS2) and to systematically investigate the catalytic activity of catalysts toward CO2 electroreduction. Co@2D-FeS2 shows superior catalytic activity and selectivity towards HCOOH production, and significantly suppresses the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The better HCOOH activity is associated with the lower d-band center and the localized charge distribution of transition metal atom. Ti@2D-FeS2 and V@2D-FeS2 exhibit good catalytic activity for CO production from CO2 electroreduction. Their overpotentials required for CO production are lower than that of the most active Au electrode. Ti@2D-FeS2 and V@2D-FeS2 serve as better catalysts to produce syngas. Cr@2D-FeS2 is a promising catalyst to produce CH4 from CO2 electroreduction. Cr@2D-FeS2 shows an exceptional performance for CH4 production, and outperforms the currently most active CO2RR-to-CH4 catalysts. Specifically, only a lower overpotential of 0.36 V is required to enable CO2 reduction to CH4. Cr@2D-FeS2 is also catalytically active towards C2H4 production due to the relatively lower overpotential of 0.64 V. The reduced overpotentials and excellent product selectivity could provide an encouraging motivation for experimental efforts to explore the advanced generations of highly-efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.130541
Dual carbon-hosted Co-N3 enabling unusual reaction pathway for efficient oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Single-atom cobalt-nitrogen-carbon (Co-N-C) has emerged as one of the most promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as it has the utmost atomic utilization efficiency and may avoid possible Fenton reactions. Herein, we report dual carbon-supported single-atom cobalt with the unusual Co-N coordination number of three (Co-N3-C) as an efficient catalyst for the ORR. The combination of experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Co-N3-C would experience an activation process and be favorable to lowering the energy barriers of the intermediates, leading to accelerated reaction kinetics. The as-prepared Co-N3-C catalyst exhibited unprecedented ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.891 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and outstanding stability under alkaline conditions, not only outperforming the previously reported Co-based catalysts but also surpassing state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. The current work may provide a new insight into the engineering of the single-atom coordination environment to improve the catalytic activity.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120390
"Formamide-derived ""glue"" for the hundred-gram scale synthesis of atomically dispersed iron-nitrogen-carbon electrocatalysts","© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The distinct structure and maximum utilization of metal atoms on supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) represents a new frontier of heterogeneous catalysis, yet the low-cost mass production of high-performance SACs is still a key issue for practical applications. Herein, by coating a formamide-derived highly N-modified carbonaceous layer as a ""glue""on commercially available activated carbon black (AC), a hundred-gram scale synthesis of atomically dispersed non-noble metal-nitrogen-carbon (MNC) materials was realized, including but not limited to Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, and Cu. The dispersion and coordination environments of Fe atoms on AC were initially revealed by XRD, HRTEM, and XPS, and further confirmed by HAADF-STEM and XANES analysis, presenting Fe atoms in a Fe-N4 structure. The atomically dispersed metal species, though relatively low-loading grafted on AC (typical loading of 0.16 to 0.29 at%), are mostly distributed on the electrochemically accessible surface, resulting in improved metal utilization. The FeNC@AC-3 sample exhibited highly comparable catalytic performance to 20 wt% Pt/C for the alkaline oxygen reduction reaction, and superior Al-air battery performance. Our work may inspire the synthesis of other types of SACs for broad electrocatalysis applications at kilogram or even ton scale. This journal is",Nanoscale,10.1039/d1nr05209h
Origin of the N-coordinated single-atom Ni sites in heterogeneous electrocatalysts for CO2reduction reaction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Heterogeneous Ni-N-C single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted great research interest regarding their capability in facilitating the CO2reduction reaction (CO2RR), with CO accounting for the major product. However, the fundamental nature of their active Ni sites remains controversial, since the typically proposed pyridinic-type Ni configurations are inactive, display low selectivity, and/or possess an unfavorable formation energy. Herein, we present a constant-potential first-principles and microkinetic model to study the CO2RR at a solid-water interface, which shows that the electrode potential is crucial for governing CO2activation. A formation energy analysis on several NiNxC4−x(x= 1-4) moieties indicates that the predominant Ni moieties of Ni-N-C SACs are expected to have a formula of NiN4. After determining the potential-dependent thermodynamic and kinetic energy of these Ni moieties, we discover that the energetically favorable pyrrolic-type NiN4moiety displays high activity for facilitating the selective CO2RR over the competing H2evolution. Moreover, model polarization curves and Tafel analysis results exhibit reasonable agreement with existing experimental data. This work highlights the intrinsic tetrapyrrolic coordination of Ni for facilitating the CO2RR and offers practical guidance for the rational improvement of SACs, and this model can be expanded to explore mechanisms of other electrocatalysis in aqueous solutions.",Chemical Science,10.1039/d1sc04094d
Revealing Hydrogen Evolution Performance of Single-Atom Platinum Electrocatalyst with Polyoxometalate Molecular Models,"© Single-Atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted much attention due to their outstanding catalytic activity and maximum atom utilization. However, the unclear structure of the atomic active site hinders deep understanding and wide applications of SACs. Herein, we select a series of single-Atom platinum (Pt)-containing polyoxometalates with well-defined structures as molecular models to clarify the effects of metal-oxide support and coordination environment on the activity of single-Atom Pt electrocatalyst for HER. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density function theory calculation reveal that metal-oxide supports affect the ability of atomic Pt site to obtain electrons, resulting in different effective potentials loaded on the Pt active center in HER. Meanwhile, the coordination environment of single-Atom Pt determines the pathway of HER, which also leads to different HER performance. This work provides a feasible strategy to reveal the structure-Activity relationship of SACs and design new high-efficiency SACs for electrocatalytic HER.",ACS Energy Letters,10.1021/acsenergylett.1c01911
First-principles investigation of two-dimensional covalent-organic framework electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution/reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) all have attracted much attention due to their utmost importance for clean and renewable energy applications. As emerging versatile nanomaterials, covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) can serve as OER/ORR/HER electrocatalysts, but their potential remains largely underexplored thus far. In this work, based on the structure of COF-366-Co achieved in recent experiments, first-principles calculations were conducted to investigate the electrocatalytic performances of fifteen two-dimensional (2D) M-COFs (M = Sc-Zn, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir) containing various metalloporphyrin active centers. The results reveal that all the M-COFs bear fully exposed, atomically dispersed, thermodynamically and electrochemically stable metal sites, as required by the ideal single-atom catalysts. According to the thermodynamic calculations, the Co-COF and Ir-COF are perfect OER catalysts with rather low theoretical overpotentials (ηOER: 0.38 and 0.34 V). The Mn-COF, Fe-COF, and Rh-COF are also promising for the OER (ηOER: 0.62, 0.57 and 0.51 V). Moreover, the Co-COF can readily catalyze the ORR (ηORR: 0.23 V) as well, and is thus a potential OER/ORR bifunctional catalyst. The Mn-COF and Fe-COF are also favorable for both ORR (ηORR: 0.50 and 0.39 V) and HER (ηHER: 0.08 and 0.10 V), and may serve as OER/ORR/HER trifunctional catalysts. Their excellent performances stem from the suitable metal d bands, which cause optimal bindings for all the key intermediate species along the reaction pathway. The current work not only finds several 2D-COFs as promising electrocatalysts, but also elucidates their exact structure-activity relationship, which is useful for the rational design of more single-atom catalysts.

Electric-Field Controllable Metal-free Materials as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Fixation,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyAn electrochemical dinitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) under mild conditions has been considered as a promising and sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber-Bosch method. However, searching for an efficient, stable, and low-cost electrocatalyst is still challenging and attractive. Here, based on density functional theory, a single B atom adsorbed on a series of carbon phosphide monolayers [B/PCxsingle-atom catalysts (SACs),x= 2, 3, 5, and 6] was constructed as metal-free catalysts and their NRR catalytic activities were systematically investigated. Consequently, among the investigated systems, the B/PC6SAC is identified as the most promising candidate, on which the N2molecule can only be sufficiently activated through the enzymatic pathway with a limiting potential of −0.37 V, and importantly, it remains as a stable structure afterab initiomolecular dynamics simulations at 300 K. It can be found from the electronic property calculations that the p-orbitals of the B atom have a good degree matching with the p-orbitals of the adsorbed N2species, favoring the activation of the N2molecule. Besides, both the N2adsorption Gibbs free energy and the NRR-limiting overpotential decrease with the increase of the positive electric-field intensity, suggesting that an electric field can be regarded as an effective external stimulus to further improve the catalytic activity of the B/PC6SAC. This study not only provides an eligible NRR electrocatalyst but also offers a useful tool, that is, applying an external electric field, for the NRR activity enhancement.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c06464
Metal-Nitrogen-Carbon Cluster-Decorated Titanium Carbide is a Durable and Inexpensive Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalyst,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHClusters of nitrogen- and carbon-coordinated transition metals dispersed in a carbon matrix (e. g., Fe−N−C) have emerged as an inexpensive class of electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, it was shown that optimizing the interaction between the nitrogen-coordinated transition metal clusters embedded in a more stable and corrosion-resistant carbide matrix yielded an ORR electrocatalyst with enhanced activity and stability compared to Fe−N−C catalysts. Utilizing first-principles calculations, an electrostatics-based descriptor of catalytic activity was identified, and nitrogen-coordinated iron (FeN4) clusters embedded in a TiC matrix were predicted to be an efficient platinum-group metal (PGM)-free ORR electrocatalyst. Guided by theory, selected catalyst formulations were synthesized, and it was demonstrated that the experimentally observed trends in activity fell exactly in line with the descriptor-derived theoretical predictions. The Fe−N−TiC catalyst exhibited enhanced activity (20 %) and durability (3.5-fold improvement) compared to a traditional Fe−N−C catalyst. It was posited that the electrostatics-based descriptor provides a powerful platform for the design of active and stable PGM-free electrocatalysts and heterogenous single-atom catalysts for other electrochemical reactions.",ChemSusChem,10.1002/cssc.202101341
High performance SACs for HER process using late first-row transition metals anchored on graphyne support: A DFT insight,"© 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCFor ever-growing demand of clean and renewable energy resources, finding a low-cost, earth abundant, and an efficient electrocatalyst to replace platinum-based catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has drawn the interest of scientific community. In present work, first-row transition metal single atom catalysts supported on graphyne surface have been designed and investigated using density functional theory approach. The results indicate that among all considered systems, the highest thermodynamic stability and best HER catalytic performance is computed for Ni single atom catalyst (SAC) anchored on graphyne support with low ΔGH∗ value of 0.08 eV. We have calculated density of states, energies of HOMO, LUMO and HOMO-LUMO gap for our designed single atom catalysts as well as hydrogen adsorption. Our results indicate that Ni anchored on graphyne support can be a promising candidate for noble metal free, earth abundant, and low cost electrocatalyst to efficiently catalyze hydrogen evolution reaction process.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.09.063
A Tandem Strategy for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Activity of Single-Atom Cu-S1N3 Catalysts via Integration with Cu Nanoclusters,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHWe developed a tandem electrocatalyst for CO2-to-CO conversion comprising the single Cu site co-coordinated with N and S anchored carbon matrix (Cu-S1N3) and atomically dispersed Cu clusters (Cux), denoted as Cu-S1N3/Cux. The as-prepared Cu-S1N3/Cux composite presents a 100 % Faradaic efficiency towards CO generation (FECO) at −0.65 V vs. RHE and high FECO over 90 % from −0.55 to −0.75 V, outperforming the analogues with Cu-N4 (FECO only 54 % at −0.7 V) and Cu-S1N3 (FECO 70 % at −0.7 V) configurations. The unsymmetrical Cu-S1N3 atomic interface in the carbon basal plane possesses an optimized binding energy for the key intermediate *COOH compared with Cu-N4 site. At the same time, the adjacent Cux effectively promotes the protonation of *CO2− by accelerating water dissociation and offering *H to the Cu-S1N3 active sites.

Double-atom catalysts as a molecular platform for heterogeneous oxygen evolution electrocatalysis,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an essential anode reaction for the generation of fuels through water splitting or CO2 electroreduction. Mixed metal oxides containing Co, Fe or Ni have proved to be the most promising OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media. However, the active sites and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts are difficult to study due to their heterogeneous nature. Here we describe a general synthesis of Co-, Fe- and Ni-containing double-atom catalysts from their single-atom precursors via in situ electrochemical transformation. Characterization reveals molecule-like bimetallic active sites for these supported catalysts. For each catalyst, we propose a catalytic cycle; all exhibit bimetallic cooperation and follow a similar O–O bond-forming step. However, the mechanisms diverge in the site and source of OH− for O–O bond formation, as well as the order of proton and electron transfer. Our work demonstrates double-atom catalysts as an attractive platform for fundamental studies of heterogeneous OER electrocatalysts.",Nature Energy,10.1038/s41560-021-00925-3

Electron-Rich Pincer Ligand-Coupled Cobalt Porphyrin Polymer with Single-Atom Sites for Efficient (Photo)Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction at Ultralow Overpotential,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHPorphyrin and phthalocyanine complexes bearing single-atom catalytic sites (M-N4) have been explored as promising electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), whose activity can be improved by regulating the ligands and/or the metal centers. Moreover, their photosensitive features also provide the possibility for highly efficient photoelectrocatalytic CO2RR. Herein, a novel N′NN′-pincer-ligand (N3)-coupled cobalt porphyrin (CoPor-N3) polymer is developed for realizing efficient (photo)electrocatalytic CO2RR. The unraveled electronic structure and (photo)electrocatalytic features suggest that a synergistic effect between the electron-rich N3 ligands and the Co-N4 single-atom sites in the CoPor-N3 polymer results in the Co centers attaining more electrons, which is beneficial to facilitating the electron transfer to CO2 for the activation and reduction processes. As expected, the resultant CoPor-N3 polymer delivers a good long-term durability and high CO faradaic efficiency (96%) at an ultralow overpotential (0.39 V), which outperforms the CoPor alone and most porphyrin-/phthalocyanine-based electrocatalysts reported so far. Moreover, the photosensitivity of CoPor units can further reduce the overpotential to 0.34 V with a CO faradaic efficiency over 90% under light illumination. The present findings offer a new approach to constructing porphyrin-based photosensitive electrocatalysts with high-efficiency photoelectrocatalytic CO2RR.",Small,10.1002/smll.202102957
Highly Conductive Amorphous Pentlandite Anchored with Ultrafine Platinum Nanoparticles for Efficient pH-Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe devise and fabrication of highly efficient electrocatalysts have momentous practical significance for the development of future hydrogen energy systems. However, their potential uses in support construction are not well studied. In this work, a highly efficient electrocatalyst is developed for the hydrogen evolution reaction by anchoring single Pt atoms and clusters into functional amorphous pentlandite Fe5Ni4S8 (or FNS) to yield Pt–FNS composites. Amorphous FNS still provides great conductivity to the composites, thereby promoting rapid charge transfer. The presence of abundant defects in Pt–FNS composite catalysts induces pleasant atomic dispersion and anchoring of Pt species. In addition, the formation of single Pt atoms combined with clusters and low-Pt-loading improves the utilization of Pt and reduces the cost. The turnover frequency analysis suggests Pt–FNS systems possess significant unit catalytic activity. The synergetic catalytic effect issued from high conductivity, abundant active sites and elevated intrinsic activity forms Pt–FNS systems with efficient pH-universal catalytic activity. The systems exhibit low overpotentials of only 30, 65, and 98 mV at 10 mA cm−2 under acidic, alkaline, and neutral conditions, respectively. In sum, the proposed route looks promising for the fabrication of new electrocatalysts with improved properties.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202105372
"Single-atom Pt decorated in heteroatom (N, B, and F)-doped ReS2 Grown on Mo2CTx for efficient pH-universal hydrogen evolution reaction and flexible Zn–air batteries","© 2021Single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit excellent catalytic performance owing to their high atom utilization efficiency. Meanwhile, members of the 2D MXenes family, particularly Mo2CTx, have recently been identified as promising electrocatalyst and have been used as a potential catalyst supports to anchor single-atom. However, it still has a potential to enhance the performance by increasing surface areas and active sites. Herein, we employ an ionic liquid for coprecipitation with ReO4− salt to synthesis N-, B-, and F-atom-doped ReS2, which is grown evenly on the surface of MoC2Tx MXene, followed by a uniform loading of single-atom Pt on NBF-ReS2. The two-dimensional morphology allows ReS2 to provide a large surface area for loading more single Pt atoms. In addition, the introduction of N, B, and F via the ionic liquid increases the number of active sites. Owing to these properties, the resulting catalyst exhibits extraordinary catalytic activity and stability during the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction. Liquid or flexible solid-state rechargeable Zn–air batteries equipped with the proposed Pt/NBF-ReS2/Mo2CTx system are also demonstrated to exhibit superior performance.

Precise regulation of pyrrole-type single-atom Mn-N4 sites for superior pH-universal oxygen reduction,"© 2021 The Authors. Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.The study of atomically dispersed metal-nitrogen electrocatalysts is still limited in terms of understanding their catalytic mechanism because of the inability to precisely regulate the coordination number and type of N in combination with the metal elements. Inspired by the high catalytic activity and selectivity of natural enzymes, herein, we have designed and fabricated ultrathin carbon nanosheet-supported Mn single-atom catalysts (SACs) with a precise pyrrole-type Mn-N4 (PT-MnN4) configuration using a bio-mimicking strategy. The PT-MnN4 SACs display outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.88 V (vs. revisible hydrogen electrode [RHE]) and extremely high stability in alkaline media. Moreover, superior ORR activities are also obtained, E1/2 of 0.73 V and 0.63 V in acid and neutral electrolytes, respectively, indicating the efficient pH-universal ORR performances. The assembled zinc–air battery using the PT-MnN4 SACs as air cathodes exhibits a high peak power density (175 mW cm−2) and long-term stability up to 150 h, implying its promising application in metal–air batteries.

Anchoring single Ni atoms on defected 2D MXene nanosheets as an efficient electrocatalyst for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Electrochemical hydrogen evolution from water splitting with the help of electrocatalysts is a clean and sustainable way to produce hydrogen fuel. In this study, Mo vacancies are intentionally created on Mo2TiC2 nanosheets (D-Mo2TiC2), which provide active sites to load Ni single-atom catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The anchored Ni single atoms are observed to occupy the Mo vacancy sites under TEM. The crystallinity of Mo2TiC2 stays unchanged in creating Mo vacancies and loading Ni single atoms, as confirmed by XRD. The as-prepared D-Mo2TiC2/Ni catalyst exhibits a lower overpotential for HER, superior HER kinetics, larger effective surface area, and lower charge transfer resistance than the intact and defective Mo2TiC2 catalysts without Ni. The overpotential for HER at 10 mA/cm2 and the Tafel slope of the D-Mo2TiC2/Ni catalyst are −0.078 V and 56.7 mV/dec, respectively, which are approaching the best performance obtained on the Pt/C electrode. The enhanced catalytic activity of the D-Mo2TiC2/Ni has been proved to persist for 10,000 cycles of electrochemical reaction, which confirms the stability of the synthesized D-Mo2TiC2/Ni catalyst. The enhanced catalytic activity of the D-Mo2TiC2/Ni is attributed to the better conductivity resulted from Mo vacancies and the excellent catalytic activity of the anchored Ni single atoms.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.07.175
Transition metal single-atom anchored g-CN monolayer for constructing high-activity multifunctional electrocatalyst,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Exploring highly efficient, economical and environment-friendly multifunctional electrocatalysts is an essential precondition for the development of renewable energy conversion and storage technology. Herein, a systematic computation based on the density functional theory (DFT) was conducted to examine the potentiality of the isolated transition metal (TM) atom anchored on g-CN, expressed as TM@CN (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt and Au), as multifunctional electrocatalysts toward HER, OER and ORR.

Importantly, the d-band center of TM atom can serve as an ideal descriptor for the adsorption energy of oxygenated intermediates. Such superb catalytic activity can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of TM and g-CN, which can effectively guarantee outstanding conductivity and electron transfer, thus tuning the interaction strength of adsorbates and optimizing the catalytic performance. The tunable catalytic activity of TM@CN would open a new perspective for optimizing catalytic performances and stimulate the developments of promising multifunctional electrocatalysts for renewable energy applications.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.150547
Enhanced mass transfer in three-dimensional single-atom nickel catalyst with open-pore structure for highly efficient CO2 electrolysis,"© 2021 Science PressDesign of efficient catalysts for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with high selectivity and activity is of great challenge, but significant for managing the global carbon balance. Herein, a series of three-dimensional (3D) single-atom metals anchored on graphene networks (3D SAM-G) with open-pore structure were successfully mass-produced via a facile in-situ calcination technique assisted by NaCl template.

Cu acting as Fe activity promoter in dual-atom Cu/Fe-NC catalyst in CO2RR to C1 products,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to the maximal atomic utilization and high catalytic activity. However, most reported SACs tend to convert CO2 to CO or HCOOH rather than other multi-electron C1 products. Here, Taking the regular Fe single-atom catalyst (Fe-NC) as a probe, our study revealed that the construction of dual-atom center through additional Cu (Cu/Fe-NC) allowed for CO2RR proceeding via multi-electron pathways to generate CH3OH and CH4 by means of density functional theory. Cu/Fe-NC exhibited low limiting potentials of −0.42, −0.51, and −0.51 V for HCOOH, CH3OH, and CH4, respectively, while a high limiting potential of −1.18 V for CO. In CO2RR process, using the synergistic effect, Fe acts as the active site and Cu acts as the activity promoter to improve Fe activity for stronger adsorption ability, which promotes the generation of multi-electron products. Hence, the Cu, Fe dual-atom center might provide better catalytic site than regular Fe single-atom center in CO2RR. This work demonstrated Cu/Fe-NC as a high performance CO2RR catalyst to multi-electron products, which will guide more experimental research in high atomically dispersed electrocatalysts to promote CO2RR to high economic value products.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.150423

Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize atomically dispersed Co atoms anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon aerogels with a 3D hierarchically porous network structure via F127-assisted pyrolysis of a phenolic resin/Co2+ composite and subsequent HCl etching treatment. HRTEM, AC-STEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that Co atoms are homogeneously atomically dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon aerogels within the porous structure by coordination with pyridinic-N.

Confinement Strategies for Precise Synthesis of Efficient Electrocatalysts from the Macroscopic to the Atomic Level,"© 2022 Accounts of Materials Research.Conspectus Tremendous efforts have shown that the precise control of the electrocatalyst structure and morphology can boost their catalytic performance toward diverse important reactions such as oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER), hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER), carbon dioxide/nitrogen reduction reactions (CO2RR/NRR), etc. The physical and chemical confined syntheses have witnessed the success in manipulating catalyst features from macroscopic to atomic level to deal with various application demands.In this Account, we summarize the recent innovative advances with an emphasis on our solutions in the precise synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts via the confinement strategies at various scales. By categorizing the confinement effects into the precursor self-confinement, nanospace confinement, and chemical binding atomic confinement with representative examples, we systematically introduced the confinement strategies in the synthesis of well-defined structures from the macroscopic to nanoscopic and atomic level. (1) Precursor self-confinement strategy. The electrode with a macroscopic hierarchical micro/nanoarray structure provides a large exposed surface area and structural merits for highly intensive electron transport and mass transfer as well as prompt gas release, which enables high-performance electrocatalytic energy devices. The self-confinement effect from the presynthesized precursors promises to rationally design and precisely fabricate such electrodes at the macroscopic level. (2) Nanospace confinement strategy. Metal clusters and nanoparticles (NPs) offer diverse surface sites for the adsorption, activation, and transformation of reactants/intermediates. The confinement from nanospaces such as 0D nanopores, 1D nanochannels, 2D interlayer spaces, and 3D interconnected nanochannels enables the synthesis of nanoclusters and NPs with controlled morphologies and structures at the nanoscopic level, allowing for investigating the collective activation of intermediates, interaction with support, size-dependent structure-performance relationship. etc. (3) Chemical binding atomic confinement strategy. The chemical binding confinement makes it possible to synthesize single atom catalysts (SACs) with the capability of delicately tailoring their electronic structure and chemical environment at the atomic level, providing opportunities for in-depth understanding the underlying catalytic processes and the structure-performance relationships. (4) Integrated confinement strategy. Taking all these confinement effects into account together is powerful to mitigate the challenges in the synthetic fields such as well-defined high-density SACs. With these insights, this Account proposes the remaining challenges and possible solutions for the precise synthesis of next-generation well-defined electrocatalysts from macroscopic to atomic level by exploring suitable confinement effects and integrating them with other techniques, which may open up opportunities for bridging the gap between the fundamental research and industrial applications.",Accounts of Materials Research,10.1021/accountsmr.1c00135

The ideal NPM electrocatalysts usually feature (1) highly active intrinsic sites; (2) high-density and uniform active sites to reduce the energy barrier of the reaction and increase the surface electron-mass transfer rate, thus improving the activity, turnover efficiency, and selectivity of the catalyst. Molecular engineering strategy is an effective approach to realize the bottom-up construction of high-performance NPM electrocatalysts with well-defined active sites. In this review, the recent progress about utilizing molecules including small molecules, metal-organic frameworks (MOF), covalent organic frameworks (COF), biomolecules, and polyoxometalate (POM) as precursors to build NPM electrocatalysts (M-NC single-atom catalysts, NPM-based materials, and metal-free carbon-based materials) with high-loading-density and well-defined active sites for electrochemical energy conversion are summarized.

"Highly exposed discrete Co atoms anchored in ultrathin porous N, P-codoped carbon nanosheets for efficient oxygen electrocatalysis and rechargeable aqueous/solid-state Zn-air batteries","© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Single atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit desirable catalytic properties in key renewable energy reactions and devices. However, rational design of SACs and boosting their performances for oxygen electrocatalysis and rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs) are still crucial yet challenging. Herein, single Co atoms anchored in ultrathin N, P-codoped porous carbon nanosheets (CoSA/NPC) were prepared by anin situconfinement pyrolysis strategy. The ultrathin nanosheet structure provides an ideal platform for high exposure of the generated Co active sites and extremely shortens the electron transport pathways. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the N/P coordinated Co sites enable optimized charge distribution and facilitate oxygen intermediate adsorption/desorption. Such a CoSA/NPC catalyst exhibits high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.87 V and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a low potential of 1.67 V at 10 mA cm−2. As an air electrode in ZABs, it demonstrates a high peak power density of 204.3 mW cm−2and excellent long-term stability in aqueous ZABs.

Enhanced Chlorinated Pollutant Degradation by the Synergistic Effect between Dechlorination and Hydroxyl Radical Oxidation on a Bimetallic Single-Atom Catalyst,"© Chlorinated organic pollutants are highly toxic and widespread in the environment, which cause ecological risk and threaten the human health. Chlorinated pollutants are difficult to degrade and mineralize by the conventional advanced oxidation process as the C-Cl bond is resistant to reactive oxygen species oxidation. Herein, we designed a bifunctional Fe/Cu bimetallic single-atom catalyst anchored on N-doped porous carbon (FeCuSA-NPC) for the electro-Fenton process, in which chlorinated pollutants are dechlorinated on single-atom Cu and subsequently oxidized by the ·OH radical produced from O2 conversion on single-atom Fe. Benefitting from the synergistic effect between dechlorination on single-atom Cu and ·OH oxidation on single-atom Fe, the chlorinated organic pollutants can be efficiently degraded and mineralized. The mass activity for chlorinated organic pollutant degradation by FeCuSA-NPC is 545.1-1374 min-1 gmetal-1, excessing the highest value of the reported electrocatalyst. Moreover, FeCuSA-NPC is demonstrated to be pH-universal, long-term stable, and environment friendly. This work provides a new insight into the rational design of a bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient removal of chlorinated organic pollutants.",Environmental Science and Technology,10.1021/acs.est.1c04943
Tailoring the electronic structure by transition-metal single atom on Ti3C2O2 for improving hydrogen evolution activity,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The development of high efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for boosting the water splitting technology. Based on the density functional theory, we investigate the HER catalytic activity of a serials of transition metal atoms (TM = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) implanted into or anchored on Ti3C2O2 as a low-cost 2D electrocatalyst with high thermodynamic stability. The results show that compared with the host Ti, the dopant TM donates less electrons to its adjacent oxygen atoms, leading to a stronger H and O bonding, while the anchored TM atom donates excess electrons to its adjacent oxygen atoms, leading to the extremely weak H and O bonding. For TM-anchored Ti3C2O2, those oxygen sites far away from TM exhibit the optimal hydrogen adsorption free energy because of their moderate electrons, indicating that the active sites and catalytic performance of Ti3C2O2 are both modulated by TM atoms.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.150210
Waste pig blood-derived 2D Fe single-atom porous carbon as an efficient electrocatalyst for zinc–air batteries and AEMFCs,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Biomass is a useful precursor for manufacturing electrocatalysts because it is highly abundant, eco-friendly, and is composed of organic materials that include Fe and nitrogen precursors. Among the numerous waste biomass types, slaughtered pig blood contains a high concentration of Fe-porphyrin inside the hemoglobin, and this characteristic makes it an ideal precursor for fabricating a bio-inspired Fe-N-C oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst. Here, Zinc (Zn)-hydrolysates are obtained from purified waste pig blood was used as a porous carbon source for two-dimensional (2D) sheet-like porous single-atom electrocatalysts. In addition, pig blood provides Fe single-atom catalytic sites derived from hemoglobin in (Zn)-hydrolysates and shows excellent ORR activity by retaining excellent mass transfer due to the presence of mesopores generated by Zn activation under NH3 pyrolysis Furthermore, one of the catalytic materials is a Zn-incorporated Fe single-atom porous carbon catalyst (designated Zn/FeSA-PC)/950/NH3, was successfully integrated as an Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (AEMFCs) and Zn-Air Batteries (ZABs) where it supported maximum power densities of 352 and 220 mW/cm2, respectively.

Monatomic Ti doped on defective monolayer boron nitride as an electrocatalyst for the synthesis of ammonia: A DFT study,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Due to its high efficiency, safety and environmental friendliness, electro catalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is expected to replace the traditional process. However, due to the high energy of N[tbnd]N, the design of effective electrocatalyst for activation and adsorption of nitrogen molecules has become a research hotspot. Single atom doped on defective two-dimensional (2D) materials is expected to increase the adsorption activity of N2 and reduce the energy barrier of the NRR rate-determining step. In this paper, we constructed Ti atom doped Stone-Wales defect type and N defect type boron nitride (BN) 2D materials (Ti-VSW-BN and Ti-VN-BN) and used DFT to study the structural properties, charges transfer and thermodynamic stability of the new materials. The results show that Ti doping can improve the stability of defective BN 2D materials, and compared with the pristine BN, the band gap is reduced from 5.117 eV to 0.828 eV and 1.192 eV, respectively. By studying Gibbs free energy of the reaction path, it is shown that defective BN 2D materials can effectively enhance efficiency of NRR. Especially for Ti-VN-BN, energy barrier in the rate-determining step of the overall reaction can be reduced from 1.20 eV (pristine BN) to 0.96 eV. It shows that defective BN 2D material has the potential to become a new catalyst for the electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.150277
Hierarchical 3D porous carbon with facilely accessible Fe-N4 single-atom sites for Zn-air batteries†,"This journal is © The Royal Society of ChemistryHere, we report a highly efficient ORR electrocatalyst with Fe-N4 active sites uniformly dispersed on a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected porous nitrogen-doped carbon network synthesized by pyrolyzing SiO2@ZIF-8 composites loaded with iron salts.

Hollow mesoporous carbon nanocages with Fe isolated single atomic site derived from a MOF/polymer for highly efficient electrocatalytic oxygen reduction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Exploring sustainable and highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is vital for the development and application of energy conversion technologies. Here, we prepared Fe-isolated single atomic site (ISAs)-supported hollow mesoporous carbon nanocages (Fe-ISAs/H-CNs). Using zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) as the templates, the iron precursor was used as the Fe source for doping, and also acted as the initiator to promote the polymerization of pyrrole for constructing the shell. In addition, the H cations released by pyrrole polymerization diffused into the interior of ZIF-8 through the pores and further broke the structure of ZIF-8, resulting in porous MOF-polymer nanocomposites (ZIF-8/Fe@PPy). After thermal treatment, the obtained Fe-ISAs/H-CN exhibited a higher half-wave potential (E1/2= 0.87 V), exceptional kinetic current density (Jk= 32.82 mA cm−2at 0.80 V), high stability, and superior tolerance to methanol crossover, exceeding those of commercial Pt/C catalyst and most previously reported non-precious-metal catalysts in alkaline media. The excellent catalytic behavior was attributable to hollow carbon nanocages and the feature of Fe single atoms with the Fe-N4configuration, which provided more active sites and was beneficial to create highly interconnected electron connection channels that facilitated oxygen exchange, reactant diffusion, and electron conduction, thus changing the reaction kinetics.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta05039g
Novel Design Strategy of High Activity Electrocatalysts toward Nitrogen Reduction Reaction via Boron-Transition-Metal Hybrid Double-Atom Catalysts,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising method for sustainable production of NH3, which provides an alternative to the traditional Haber-Bosch process. However, the poor Faraday efficiency caused by N≡N triple bond activation and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have seriously hindered the application of NRR. In this work, a novel strategy to promote NRR through boron-transition-metal (TM) hybrid double-atom catalysts (HDACs) has been proposed. The excellent catalytic activity of HDACs is attributed to a significant difference of valence electron distribution between boron and TMs, which could better activate N≡N bonds and promote the conversion of NH2 to NH3 compared with boron or metal single-atom catalysts and traditional double-atom catalysts (DACs). Hence, by means of DFT computations, the stability, activity, and selectivity of 29 HDACs are systematically investigated to evaluate their catalytic performance. B-Ti@g-CN and B-Ta@g-CN are screened as excellent nitrogen-fixing catalysts with particularly low limiting potentials of 0.13 and 0.11 V for NRR and rather high potentials of 0.54 and 0.82 V for HER, respectively. This work provides a new idea for the rational design of efficient nitrogen-fixing catalysts and could also be widely used in other catalytic reactions.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c11889
Low-Valence Znδ+ (0<δ<2) Single-Atom Material as Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHA nitrogen-stabilized single-atom catalyst containing low-valence zinc atoms (Znδ+-NC) is reported. It contains saturated four-coordinate (Zn-N4) and unsaturated three-coordinate (Zn-N3) sites. The latter makes Zn a low-valence state, as deduced from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and density functional theory. Znδ+-NC catalyzes electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO with near-unity selectivity in water at an overpotential as low as 310 mV. A current density up to 1 A cm−2 can be achieved together with high CO selectivity of >95 % using Znδ+-NC in a flow cell. Calculations suggest that the unsaturated Zn-N3 could dramatically reduce the energy barrier by stabilizing the COOH* intermediate owing to the electron-rich environment of Zn.

Given the high catalytic activity of single-atom catalysts (SACs), preparing SACs on a large scale for ZABs is desirable but remains challenging. Herein, in situ formation of single-atom Fe-N-C catalysts on plate wood-based porous carbon is achieved via a facile Lewis acid pretreatment and carbonization process. Lewis acid FeCl3 pretreatment on the cell wall of wood not only produces abundant microchannels but also successfully introduces atomically dispersed Fe-N active species into the hierarchical structure. Such uniformly dispersive SACs on the hierarchical structure enhance the ORR/OER performance and durability.

However, it is challenging to synthesize atomically dispersed electrocatalysts with high density and high performance. Herein, an integrated g-C3N4-C-TiO2heterostructural nanosphere with oxygen-rich vacancies is constructed by a multicomponent assembly-calcination strategy. Abundant single Ru atoms (12.4 wt %) are then anchoredviathe occupation of partial oxygen vacancies, forming a unique Ru/g-C3N4-C-TiO2heterostructure. A reasonable configuration is developed including single Ru atoms bonded with two oxygens and two nitrogens and coupled with jacent oxygen vacancies on the g-C3N4-C-TiO2nanosphere. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the remaining oxygen vacancies are beneficial for water dissociation, while single Ru atoms facilitate hydrogen adsorption. As expected, the result exhibits high electrocatalytic activity, delivering overpotentials of 112 and 107 mV at 10 mA cm-2, Tafel slopes of 83 and 65 mV dec-1in H2SO4and KOH, and a turnover frequency of 0.28 H2s-1at −100 mV toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

All rights reserved.The ability to create highly efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts, capable of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the same electrolyte, represents an important endeavor toward high-performance zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, we report a facile strategy for crafting wrinkled MoS2/N-doped carbon core/shell nanospheres interfaced with single Fe atoms (denoted MoS2@Fe-N-C) as superior ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts for robust wearable ZABs with a high capacity and outstanding cycling stability. Specifically, the highly crumpled MoS2 nanosphere core is wrapped with a layer of single-Fe-atom-impregnated, N-doped carbon shell (i.e., Fe-N-C shell with well-dispersed FeN4 sites). Intriguingly, MoS2@Fe-N-C nanospheres manifest an ORR half-wave potential of 0.84 V and an OER overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA·cm−2. More importantly, density functional theory calculations reveal the lowered energy barriers for both ORR and OER, accounting for marked enhanced catalytic performance of MoS2@Fe-N-C nanospheres. Remarkably, wearable ZABs assembled by capitalizing on MoS2@Fe-N-C nanospheres as an air electrode with an ultralow area loading (i.e., 0.25 mg·cm−2) display excellent stability against deformation, high special capacity (i.e., 442 mAh·g−1Zn), excellent power density (i.e., 78 mW·cm−2) and attractive cycling stability (e.g., 50 cycles at current density of 5 mA·cm−2).

Synergistic Effect of Platinum Single Atoms and Nanoclusters Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2021 Chinese Chemical Society. All Rights Reserved.Maximizing atomic utilization of precious metal-based catalysts is of great significance in heterogeneous catalysis, also becoming a useful strategy to develop efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Although the dispersion of platinum (Pt) as single atoms (SAs) has increasingly been used in the design of HER electrocatalysts, it is still controversial if the SAs possess higher reactivity relative to the nanoparticles with identical atom loading. Here, by virtue of computational studies, we find that atomic step-rich Pt clusters and defective graphene (DG)-loaded Pt SAs are beneficial to water dissociation and hydrogen coupling, respectively, predicting that decent activity and high atomic utilization for alkaline HER electrocatalysis will be exhibited on the structure that integrates both Pt SAs and nanoclusters onto the DG matrix (PtSA/NC-DG). We experimentally synthesize the PtSA/NC-DG catalyst for alkaline HER. The optimized PtSA/NC-DG delivers an overpotential of 41 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and mass activity of 5.4 mA μgpt−1 at the overpotential of 100 mV. The mass activity is nearly 6 and 10 times higher than that of its Pt SA counterpart and commercial Pt/C catalyst.

In this study, a flow cell system is built for electrocatalytic production of H2O2 under an air atmosphere in simulated seawater using cobalt single-atom catalysts (Co SACs). The Co SACs can achieve a high H2O2 production rate of 3.4 mol gcatalyst-1 h-1 under an air flow at a current density of 50 mA cmgeo-2 and long-term stability over 24 h in 0.5 M NaCl. It is found that Co-N5 rather than the Co-N4 structure in Co SACs is the main active site for H2O2 formation in the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. It also shows high chloride-endurability without inhibition of the ORR process in simulated seawater.

Laser-Irradiated Holey Graphene-Supported Single-Atom Catalyst towards Hydrogen Evolution and Oxygen Reduction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom catalysts (SAC) can boost the intrinsic catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the challenge remains due to the complex synthesis process and insufficient stability. A sustainable approach is applied to synthesizing SACs through laser irradiation and gaining mesoporous graphene oxide (MGO). The surface dangling bonds of nitrogen-doped MGO (NMGO) extract metal atoms species from Co or Fe metal foams and convert them to SAC via an appropriate synthesis approach. Notably, the Co-NMGO electrocatalyst requires low potentials of 146 mV to convey a current density of 10 mA cm−2 towards HER. Similarly, the Fe-NMGO electrocatalyst offers an onset of 0.79 V towards ORR in acidic solution. The individual metal atoms are confirmed via aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure. Density functional theory calculations by applying the grand canonical potential kinetics model revealed that Co-NMGO shows the optimum free reaction energy of −0.17 eV at −0.1 V for HER, and Fe-NMGO has less limiting potential than that of Co-NMGO for ORR case.

Simultaneously Engineering the Coordination Environment and Pore Architecture of Metal–Organic Framework-Derived Single-Atomic Iron Catalysts for Ultraefficient Oxygen Reduction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHDesigning highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts that accelerate sluggish oxygen reduction reaction kinetics for fuel cells and metal–air batteries are highly desirable but challenging. Herein, a facile yet robust strategy is reported to rationally design single iron active centers synergized with local S atoms in metal–organic frameworks derived from hierarchically porous carbon nanorods (Fe/N,S-HC). The cooperative trithiocyanuric acid-based coating not only introduces S atoms that regulate the coordination environment of the active centers, but also facilitates the formation of a hierarchically porous structure. Benefiting from electronic modulation and architectural functionality, Fe/N,S-HC catalyst shows markedly enhanced ORR performance with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.912 V and satisfactory long-term durability in alkaline medium, outperforming those of commercial Pt/C. Impressively, Fe/N,S-HC-based Zn–air battery also presents outstanding battery performance and long-term stability. Both electrochemical experimental and density functional theoretical (DFT) calculated results suggest that the FeN4 sites tailored with local S atoms are favorable for the adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediate, resulting in lower activation energy barrier and ultraefficient oxygen reduction catalytic activity.

Boosting Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia on FeN4 Sites by Atomic Spin Regulation,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHUnderstanding the relationship between the electronic state of active sites and N2 reduction reaction (NRR) performance is essential to explore efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, atomically dispersed Fe and Mo sites are designed and achieved in the form of well-defined FeN4 and MoN4 coordination in polyphthalocyanine (PPc) organic framework to investigate the influence of the spin state of FeN4 on NRR behavior. The neighboring MoN4 can regulate the spin state of Fe center in FeN4 from high-spin (dxy2dyz1dxz1 (Formula presented.) 1 (Formula presented.) 1) to medium-spin (dxy2dyz2dxz1 (Formula presented.) 1), where the empty d orbitals and separate d electron favor the overlap of Fe 3d with the N 2p orbitals, more effectively activating N≡N triple bond. Theoretical modeling suggests that the NRR preferably takes place on FeN4 instead of MoN4, and the transition of Fe spin state significantly lowers the energy barrier of the potential determining step, which is conducive to the first hydrogenation of N2. As a result, FeMoPPc with medium-spin FeN4 exhibits 2.0 and 9.0 times higher Faradaic efficiency and 2.0 and 17.2 times higher NH3 yields for NRR than FePPc with high-spin FeN4 and MoPPc with MoN4, respectively. These new insights may open up opportunities for exploiting efficient NRR electrocatalysts by atomically regulating the spin state of metal centers.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.202102915
Size-Dependent Cobalt Catalyst for Lithium Sulfur Batteries: From Single Atoms to Nanoclusters and Nanoparticles,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe sulfur redox conversion with catalytically improved kinetics is promising to mitigate the polysulfides shuttling. While the size of electrocatalyst always brings different catalytic behaviors for various heterogeneous catalytic reactions, it is yet to be explored for Li-S batteries. Herein, a systematical study of size-dependent catalytic activity toward polysulfides conversion and the relevance to electrochemical performance are reported, by constructing Co catalysts with different atomic scales from single atoms, atomic clusters to nanoparticles. Fundamental electrocatalytic studies are focused by probing the reduction kinetics and activation energies of sulfur chemistry. The single atomic Co shows the best charge transfer/kinetic toward sulfur redox, especially for the rate-determining reaction (Li2S4 ↔ Li2S) as demonstrated by the significantly lowered energy barrier for Li2S nucleation/dissolution. This is owing to stronger geometric deformation of the catalyst with lower aggregation extent when it interacts with sulfur species, thus leading to decreased Gibbs free energy changes as elucidated by DFT calculations. The superior catalytic activity of single atomic Co promises a high specific capacity (4.98 mAh cm−2) at an areal loading of 4.3 mg cm−2 over long-term cycling. The finding emphasizes the significance of the size-dependent catalytic activity to the reaction kinetics and the overall performance of Li-S batteries.",Small Methods,10.1002/smtd.202100571

Computational Screening of Single Atoms Anchored on Defective Mo2CO2 MXene Nanosheet as Efficient Electrocatalysts for the Synthesis of Ammonia,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) over single-atom catalysts (SACs) anchored on Mo vacancies of Mo2CO2 MXene nanosheets under ambient conditions suffers from poor selectivity, low yield, and low Faradaic efficiency because of their sluggish kinetics and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, density functional theory calculations are performed to improve the understanding of the selectivity and yielding of ammonia through NRR over various isolated SACs, that is, from Sc to Au, anchored on the Mo vacancy of the Mo2CO2 MXene nanosheet (denoted as MO2CO2-MSA). The potential-determining step of the NRR shows that eight candidates (i.e., Y, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, W, Re, and Os) confined on the defective Mo2CO2 layer could promote the electroreduction from N2 to NH3. Among these, Mo2CO2-YSA presented the lowest reported reaction Presents the lowest reported reaction energy barrier (0.08 eV) through the distal pathway and high selectivity to NRR compared with the previously synthesized Mo2CO2-RuSA with a relatively high energy barrier (0.65 eV) and poor selectivity. In addition, the formation energy of Mo2CO2-YSA is more negative than that of the Mo2CO2-RuSA catalyst, suggesting that the experimental preparation of the Mo2CO2-YSA catalyst is highly feasible. This work lays a solid foundation for improving the rational design of MXene-based systems as efficient electrocatalysts for the synthesis of ammonia.",Advanced Engineering Materials,10.1002/adem.202100405
Anchoring Single Copper Atoms to Microporous Carbon Spheres as High-Performance Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHAlthough the carbon-supported single-atom (SA) electrocatalysts (SAECs) have emerged as a new form of highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts, the preferable sites of carbon support for anchoring SAs are somewhat elusive. Here, a KOH activation approach is reported to create abundant defects/vacancies on the porous graphitic carbon nanosphere (CNS) with selective adsorption capability toward transition-metal (TM) ions and innovatively utilize the created defects/vacancies to controllably anchor TM–SAs on the activated CNS via TM-Nx coordination bonds. The synthesized TM-based SAECs (TM-SAs@N-CNS, TM: Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni) possess superior ORR electrocatalytic activities. The Cu-SAs@N-CNS demonstrates excellent ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and is successfully applied as a highly efficient air cathode material for the Zn–air battery. Importantly, it is proposed and validated that the N-terminated vacancies on graphitic carbons are the preferable sites to anchor Cu-SAs via a Cu-(N-C2)3(N-C) coordination configuration with an excellent promotional effect toward ORR. This synthetic approach exemplifies the expediency of suitable defects/vacancies creation for the fabrication of high-performance TM-based SAECs, which can be implemented for the synthesis of other carbon-supported SAECs.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202104864
Atomic Co/Ni dual sites with N/P-coordination as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) single-atom catalysts exhibit desirable electrochemical catalytic properties. However, the replacement of N atoms by heteroatoms (B, P, S, etc.) has been regarded as a useful method for regulating the coordination environment. The structure engineered M-N-C sites via doping heteroatoms play an important role to the adsorption and activation of the oxygen intermediate. Herein, we develop an efficient strategy to construct dual atomic site catalysts via the formation of a Co1-PN and Ni1-PN planar configuration. The developed Co1-PNC/Ni1-PNC catalyst exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance in alkaline solution. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that the N/P coordinated Co/Ni sites moderately reduced the binding interaction of oxygen intermediates. The Co1-PNC/Ni1-PNC endows a rechargeable Zn-air battery with excellent power density and cycling stability as an air-cathode, which is superior to that of the benchmark Pt/C+IrO2. This work paves an avenue for design of dual single-atomic sites and regulation of the atomic configuration on carbon-based materials to achieve high-performance electrocatalysts.

Molten salt assisted fabrication of Fe@FeSA-N-C oxygen electrocatalyst for high performance Zn-air battery,"© 2021 Science PressNon-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts with superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity to platinum (Pt) are highly desirable but their fabrications are challenging and thus impeding their applications in metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Here, we report a facile molten salt assisted two-step pyrolysis strategy to construct carbon nanosheets matrix with uniformly dispersed Fe3N/Fe nanoparticles and abundant nitrogen-coordinated Fe single atom moieties (Fe@FeSA-N-C). Thermal exfoliation and etching effect of molten salt contribute to the formation of carbon nanosheets with high porosity, large surface area and abundant uniformly immobilized active sites. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image, X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicate the generation of Fe (mainly Fe3N/Fe) and FeSA-N-C moieties, which account for the catalytic activity for ORR. Further study on modulating the crystal structure and composition of Fe3N/Fe nanoparticles reveals that proper chemical environment of Fe in Fe3N/Fe notably optimizes the ORR activity. Consequently, the presence of abundant FeSA-N-C moieties, and potential synergies of Fe3N/Fe nanoparticles and carbon shells, markedly promote the reaction kinetics. The as-developed Fe@FeSA-N-C-900 electrocatalyst displays superior ORR performance with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.83 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a diffusion limited current density of 5.6 mA cm−2. In addition, a rechargeable Zn-air battery device assembled by the Fe@FeSA-N-C-900 possesses remarkably stable performance with a small voltage gap without obvious voltage loss after 500 h of operation. The facile synthesis strategy for the high-performance composites represents another viable avenue to stable and low-cost electrocatalysts for ORR catalysis.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.02.015
"Carbon nanotube-bridged N-doped mesoporous carbon nanosphere with atomic and nanoscaled M (M = Fe, Co) species for synergistically enhanced oxygen reduction reaction","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Rational design of hierarchically structured carbon nanomaterials and also the facile regulation of their metal species decoration for enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are urgently required. Herein, N-doped carbon nanospheres (N-MCN) with plentiful pyridinic and graphitized N-induced active sites were closely bridged with carbon nanotubes to remedy the conductivity loss of N-doping. The as-obtained N-MCN@CNT exhibited hierarchically porous structure with large surfaces area and good conductivity with small charge transfer resistance, which therefore had a superior ORR activity to the other carbon-base catalysts. Importantly, the metal species (M = Fe or Co) can be loaded in this porous N-MCN@CNT via a simple co-pyrolysis, where their numbers and shapes can be easily regulated. It was found the optimal adsorption of metal ions into the precursors produced both single atom and few carbon-coated nanoparticles in M/N-MCN@CNT, which thus synergistically contributed the enhanced ORR performances, including large current density, low onset and half-wave potentials, as well as superior stability and methanol tolerance than those of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. Moreover, M/N-MCN@CNT also demonstrated comparable oxygen evolution reaction activity to RuO2 possibly due to the regulated metal species. This work provided a strategy to regulate the nanostructure and intrinsic active sites of carbon-based electrocatalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.129689
Coronene-Based 2D Metal-Organic Frameworks: A New Family of Promising Single-Atom Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyElectrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is becoming increasingly important for ammonia (NH3) synthesis, but the development of effective electrocatalysts remains a great challenge. Here, by means of extensive first-principles calculations, we systematically study the potential of coronene-based two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (TM-PTC, TM = Fe, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu) as single-atom catalysts for dinitrogen (N2) fixation. Our results show that the gas phase N2can be readily reduced to NH3on V/Fe-PTC through the enzymatic/distal mechanism with a quite low overpotential of 0.60/0.53 V. The underlying physics for the excellent NRR performance is discussed in detail. Moreover, the competing reaction of hydrogen evaluation reaction (HER) is dramatically suppressed in Fe-PTC, endowing them with high selectivity and thus rendering them ideal for NH3synthesis. This work not only provides efficient electrocatalysts for NRR under mild reaction conditions but also helps guide the future development of single-atom electrocatalysts.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c05893
Solving the Trifunctional Activity Challenge of Catalysts in Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cells via 1T-MoS2-Coordinated Single Pd Atoms,"© 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical SocietyDeveloping high-efficiency and low-cost multifunctional electrocatalysts is the core of unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFC), yet it remains a great challenge. Here, by performing first-principles calculations, we report the atomic-level electrocatalytic activity mechanism of 3d, 4d, and 5d monoatomic transition metals (TM) bound to the 1T-MoS2monolayer for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Their structural stabilities are evaluated via the formation energy, elastic constant, and molecular dynamics simulations. Compared with the Co-N4-C single atom catalyst (SAC), the resulting Pd@1T-MoS2SAC exhibits better bifunctional catalytic activity, with OER overpotential as low as 0.43 V and an ORR overpotential of 0.40 V. The dual volcano plot demonstrates that the bifunctional OER and ORR activities of Pd@1T-MoS2originate from the neither strong nor weak OH* adsorption and the suitabled-band center (−1.83 eV) of the Pd active center. In conjunction with the intrinsic activity of the 1T-MoS2monolayer for hydrogen evolution reaction, the Pd@1T-MoS2SAC is a competitive and promising trifunctional electrocatalyst for sustainable energy conversion and storage systems.",ACS Omega,10.1021/acsomega.1c03575
Decarboxylation-Induced Defects in MOF-Derived Single Cobalt Atom@Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHDeveloping transition metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great importance. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as a subgroup of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are distinguished as SAC precursors, due to their large porosity and N content. However, the activity of the formed metal sites is limited. Herein, we report a decarboxylation-induced defects strategy to improve their intrinsic activity via increasing the defect density. Carboxylate/amide mixed-linker MOF (DMOF) was chosen to produce defective Co SACs (Co@DMOF) by gas-transport of Co species to DMOF upon heating. Comparing with ZIF-8 derived SAC (Co@ZIF-8-900), Co@DMOF-900 with more defects yet one fifth Co content and similar specific double-layer capacitance show better ORR activity and eight times higher turnover frequency (2.015 e s−1 site−1). Quantum calculation confirms the defects can weaken the adsorption free energy of OOH on Co sites and further boost the ORR process.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202107053
Molecular transition metal corrole as an efficient electrocatalyst for the heterogeneous CO2 electroreduction: A theory study,"© 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCCarbon dioxide electrochemical reduction (eCO2RR) has been regarded as an important solution for low-carbon economy. However, challenges remain for searching low-cost and high selectivity catalysts. Here, we investigated electrocatalytic activity of molecular catalysts containing transition metal single atom supported on corrole as the eCO2RR catalysts (TM/SACC) by DFT. Various C1 products can be produced on the 14 TM/SACC, including methane (CH4), formic acid (HCOOH) and CO. We found CO and formic acid are major products on TM/SACC (TM = Ni, Pd, Zn, Cu, Au, Ag) at higher overpotentials, while methane are major eCO2RR products on TM/SACC (TM = Mn, Cr, Nb, Mo, Zr, V, Ti, Cd) at lower overpotentials. Our studies indicate Mn/SACC gives high selectivity for methane formation. Due to the lowest overpotential value of 0.46 V, Mn/SACC can be a quite promising catalyst with excellent performance for reduction of CO2 to methane along the most favorable pathway: CO2 → COOH∗ → CO∗ → CHO∗ → CH2O∗ → CH2OH∗ → CH3OH∗→CH3∗→CH4∗→CH4(g), among which the hydrogenation of CHO∗ to CH2O∗ and CH3OH∗ to CH3∗ and H2O are the limiting-potential step and rate-determining step, respectively. The study shows corrole with different transition metal could adjust the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts, which offer a hopeful strategy for the design of molecular catalysts.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.157
Atomically dispersed Pd electrocatalyst for efficient aqueous phase dechlorination reaction,"© 2021High atom utilization is important for practical application of Pd catalysts in dechlorination of chlorinated organic pollutants (COPs). Herein, we report atomically dispersed Pd (coordinated with 2 pyridinic N) anchored on N-doped carbon (A-Pd-NC) as an efficient catalyst toward electrochemical dechlorination of COPs in aqueous solution. Constant current electrolysis showed that the A-Pd-NC catalyst possessed a much higher dechlorination activity (DA, 98.9 mmol•g−1•h−1) than commercial Pd/C (2.4 mmol•g−1•h−1). Using A-Pd-NC as an effective electrocatalyst, near 100% product selectivity of 4-chlorophenol to phenol could be achieved at pH = 3. Constant potential electrolysis, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron spin resonance (ESR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results suggested that the dechlorination stability of A-Pd-NC was dependent on the potential applied on the catalyst and the dechlorination reaction followed the hydrodechlorination mechanism with electrochemically adsorbed H as the reductant.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.138886
The role of supported dual-atom on graphitic carbon nitride for selective and efficient CO2electrochemical reduction,"© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.The electrochemical reduction of CO2 into value-added fuels and chemicals using single atom (SACs) or dual-atom catalysts (DACs) has been extensively studied, but the reaction mechanism and design rules are still unclear. Here, we studied the role of dual-metal atoms on graphite carbon nitride (M1M2@g-CN, M1M2 = CuCu, FeFe, RuRu, RuCu, RuFe, CuFe) for selective and efficient CO2 electrochemical reduction based on density functional theory. Our results show that CO2RR on RuRu@g-CN catalyst prefers the ∗COOH pathway, while for CuCu@g-CN, FeFe@g-CN, RuCu@g-CN, RuFe@g-CN, CuFe@g-CN catalysts, the ∗OCHO pathway is more suitable. Among all the DACs combinations, we found that RuCu@g-CN and RuFe@g-CN are the most promising electrocatalysts for CO2RR with a lower limiting potential, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of different O- and C-affinity of the heterocenters in DACs. The selectivity of RuCu@g-CN and RuFe@g-CN to the production of CH4 is better than that of H2 evolution. In addition, we also found that the adsorption free energy of intermediate on heteroatomic DACs can be predicted by those on homoatomic DACs, which can be used to further predict the limiting potential.",Nanotechnology,10.1088/1361-6528/ac0be5
First principles investigation on cobalt–tetracyanoquinodimethane monolayer for efficient Bi-functional single atom electrocatalyst,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.A bi-functional electrocatalyst is a stable and catalytically active material for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the development of which is highly challenging, although essential for application in fuel cells. Herein, the first principle based density functional theory (DFT) computations have been carried out to investigate a series of transition metal-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TM-TCNQ: TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd) monolayer for bi-functional single atom electrocatalyst towards ORR and OER. Amongst various first transition metal row based TCNQ substrates, Cobalt-TCNQ (Co-TCNQ) monolayer was predicted to exhibit best bi-functional catalytic activity. At equilibrium potential (1.23 V, vs RHE), the free energy portraits of Co-TCNQ monolayer for OER in acidic or alkaline media are not completely downhill, measuring an excess potential of 0.6 V, equal to the overpotential, which is needed to be supplied externally to promote the OER activity. On the other hand, an onset potentials of 0.34 V (vs RHE) in acidic media are measured for ORR to proceed. The promising catalytic activity of two dimensional Co-TCNQ monolayer towards ORR and OER as revealed by DFT investigations has been explained in terms of density of states and Bader charge analysis.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry,10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.115602
"Covalent triazine frameworks-derived N,P dual-doped porous carbons for highly efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2","© 2021 Fujian Institute of Research of the Structure of Matter. All rights reserved.Electroreduction of CO2 into chemicals is of great importance in the global carbon balance. Although noble-metal based catalysts and single-atom catalysts (SACs) are known to be active for CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR), the high cost of noble-metal and the lack of effective synthesis approaches to prepare SACs have tremendously hindered the application. Non-metal doped carbon materials have attracted great interest because of their reasonable cost, chemical stability and excellent electrical conductivity. Nevertheless, the design and fabrication of highly efficient non-metal doped carbon electrocatalysts for CO2RR to meet industry demands still remains a big challenge. Herein, triphenylphosphine@covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) composites were employed as precursors to fabricate N,P dual-doped porous carbon catalysts PCTF-X-Y (X represents the carbonization temperature, and Y represents the mass ratio of CTF to triphenylphosphine) for CO2RR. Due to the high specific surface areas and synergistic effect between N and P, the obtained PCTF-1000-5 exhibited high selectivity for CO production up to 84.3% at -0.7 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and long-term durability over 16 h, which are better than the reported N,P dual-doped carbon catalysts in aqueous media. This work provides a new way to design and fabricate non-metal catalysts for electrocatalysis.",Jiegou Huaxue,10.14102/j.cnki.0254-5861.2011-3118
Precise synthesis of Fe–N2 with N vacancies coordination for boosting electrochemical artificial N2 fixation,"© 2021The construction of definitive correlation between structure and catalytic properties for electrochemical artificial N2 fixation is still challenging yet significative. Herein, we have explored the coordinative unsaturation (Fe-N2) in isolated Fe atoms with nitrogen vacancies (VN, which are located at the opposite coordination sites of the Fe atom) on interconnected carbon for electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis. Benefiting from dual active centers (Fe-N2 and VN) and the spin density on both of them, the novel catalyst exhibits a synergistic improvement of catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. This work guides the design of the catalyst theoretically and synergistically and combines the advantages of Fe-N2 with VN structure creation, defect and spin-state engineering introduction toward the concurrent fulfillment of effective N2 adsorption and activation. We believe our strategy will incite more investigation into designing high-performance catalysts with well-defined coordinative unsaturation single-atom active sites for ambient ammonia synthesis and other energy conversion system.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120216
Molten-salt-assisted thermal emitting method to transform bulk Fe2O3 into Fe single atom catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in Zn-air battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Efficient, durable and low-cost electrocatalysts that accelerate sluggish oxygen reduction reaction kinetics are urgently needed for the energy conversion techniques, such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells. In this work, we develop a molten-salt-assisted thermal emitting approach to transform the cheap and easily obtainable bulk ferric (III) oxide powder into a highly efficient Fe single atom catalyst for cathodic oxygen reduction reaction. Benefiting from the strong polarity force of ionized cations and anions, the molten salt effectively facilitates breakage of chemical bonding in bulk Fe2O3 and volatilization of Fe species far below the melting point of Fe2O3 (1841 K), lowering the consumption of energy and time needed in the synthetic procedure. The vaporized Fe species are subsequently anchored onto the surface of nitrogen-doped porous carbon, evolving the single-atom “Fe-N4-O2” site catalyst. The obtained catalyst presents an excellent oxygen reduction reaction performance with half-wave potential of 0.896 V vs RHE in alkaline media, comparable to the most efficient non-precious metal catalysts and outperforming the benchmark system Pt/C. Furthermore, this method is demonstrated to be valid for synthesis of non-noble-metal single atom catalysts (metal = Co, Mn, Cu, Ni) by changing different metal oxides precursors.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.129713
Polymer-metal complexes as emerging catalysts for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide,"© 2021, The Author(s).A class of metal-doped polyanilines (PANIs) was synthesized and investigated as electrocatalysts for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). These materials show good affinity for the electrode substrate and allow to obtain stable binder-free electrodes, avoiding the utilization of expensive ionomer and additives. The emeraldine-base polyaniline (EB-PANI), in absence of metal dopant, shows negligible electrocatalytic activity and selectivity toward the CO2RR. Such behavior significantly improves once EB-PANI is doped with an appropriate cationic metal (Mn, Cu or Sn). In particular, the Sn-PANI outperforms other metal-doped samples, showing a good turnover frequency of 72.2 h−1 for the CO2RR at − 0.99 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode and thus satisfactory activity of metal single atoms. Moreover, the Sn-PANI also displays impressive stability with a 100% retention of the CO2RR selectivity and an enhanced current density of 4.0 mA cm−2 in a 10-h test. PANI, a relatively low-cost substrate, demonstrates to be easily complexed with different metal cations and thus shows high tailorability. Complexing metal with conductive polymer represents an emerging strategy to realize active and stable metal single-atom catalysts, allowing efficient utilization of metals, especially the raw and precious ones.

Constructing Precise Coordination of Nickel Active Sites on Hierarchical Porous Carbon Framework for Superior Oxygen Reduction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) with specific coordination environment are expected to be efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, Ni-N4-C10 coordination site is constructed through encapsulating Ni2+ into the cavity of ZIF-8 as a self-sacrificing precursor and anchoring it on 3D N-doped carbon frameworks. The Ni-N4-C10 catalyst shows excellent ORR activity and stability, with a high half-wave potential (0.938 V vs RHE), which is currently the best performances in Ni-based SACs. The remarkable performance with high ORR activity in alkaline solution is attributed to the single-atom nickel active sites with faster electron transport and suitable electronic structure. Moreover, the power density of zinc-air battery assembled by Ni-N4-C10 as cathode is 47.1% higher than that of the commercial Pt/C. This work not only provides a facile method to prepare extremely active Ni-based SACs, but also studies the intrinsic mechanism toward the oxygen reduction reaction under alkaline condition.",Small,10.1002/smll.202102125
Quasi-Paired Pt Atomic Sites on Mo2C Promoting Selective Four-Electron Oxygen Reduction,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHAtomically dispersed Pt species are advocated as a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to boost noble metal utilization efficiency. However, when assembled on various substrates, isolated Pt single atoms are often demonstrated to proceed through the two-electron ORR pathway due to the unfavorable O─O bond cleavage thermodynamics in the absence of catalytic ensemble sites. In addition, although their distinct local coordination environments at the exact single active sites are intensively explored, the interactions and synergy between closely neighboring single atom sites remain elusive. Herein, atomically dispersed Pt monomers strongly interacting on a Mo2C support is demonstrated as a model catalyst in the four-electron ORR, and the beneficial interactions between two closely neighboring and yet non-contiguous Pt single atom sites (named as quasi-paired Pt single atoms) are shown. Compared to isolated Pt single atom sites, the quasi-paired Pt single atoms deliver a superior mass activity of 0.224 A mg−1Pt and near-100% selectivity toward four-electron ORR due to the synergistic interaction from the two quasi-paired Pt atom sites in modulating the binding mode of reaction intermediates. Our first-principles calculations reveal a unique mechanism of such quasi-paired configuration for promoting four-electron ORR.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.202101344
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4 over transition metal atom embedded antimonene: First-principles study,"© 2021Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) represents a promising way for the utilization of renewable energy such as wind and solar to produce value-added fuels or chemicals. The process mainly suffers from the sluggish CO2 reaction kinetics and the lack of efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we investigated a wide range of transition metal (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Ir, Pt and Au) atoms anchored into monovacancy of antimonene (Sb monolayer) as single-atom catalysts (SACs) for ECR by first- principles calculation. Interestingly, non-precious TM atoms from the 3d group (TM = Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Zn) supported on Sb monolayer show higher ECR selectivity than hydrogen evolution reaction selectivity. Moreover, the primary ECR product of these non-precious metal-based SACs is CH4, except for Zn which produces HCOOH. Co@Sb monolayer exhibits the lowest overpotential 0.50 V, which is comparable to reported excellent electrocatalysts. The interaction between TM atom and Sb monolayer greatly affects the intrinsic activity of SACs. Meanwhile, the interaction between TM atoms and intermediates of the potential determining steps (PDS) will determine the overpotential and final products of ECR. This work opens a new family of stable and selective SACs based on antimonene monolayer and provides new insights for screening SACs by charge transfer of bonding atoms.",Journal of CO2 Utilization,10.1016/j.jcou.2021.101645
PdBi Single-Atom Alloy Aerogels for Efficient Ethanol Oxidation,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle-atom alloys (SAAs) have ignited a surge of unprecedented interest as the advanced nanomaterials and opened many opportunities for wide applications.

Benefiting from the unique structures of aerogels including synergistic effects of PdBi SAA nanowire networks and interface engineering, the optimized IL/Pd50Bi1 aerogels display a nearly fourfold enhancement in mass activity and boosted stability for EOR compared to commercial Pd/C.

Double boosting single atom Fe–N4 sites for high efficiency O2 and CO2 electroreduction,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdMetal-N4 single-atom catalysts have emerged as the frontier of catalysis. However, the low metal loading and abundance of single atoms embedded in carbon skeleton hinder their practical application. Herein, we report an effective “trapping and exposing” strategy for constructing single-atom Fe–N4 catalysts with high density of single-atom active sites. The strategy involves the strong binding of metal ions to sucrose (trapping) to prevent the migration and agglomeration of Fe3+, followed by the introduction of a mesoporous structure using an SBA-15 template to achieve sufficient exposure of the Fe–N4 sites (exposing). The as-prepared catalyst comprises Fe–N4 moieties (10.8 wt%) with a hierarchical structure. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the chelating reaction between sucrose and Fe3+ ions has a low free energy, resulting in the formation of highly dispersed Fe–N4 single atoms. The single-atom catalyst displays a high peak power density of 0.784 W cm−2 in a H2–O2 proton exchange membrane fuel cell and achieves an impressive CO current density of 109 A g−1 at negligible overpotentials in a flow cell. This work provides an efficient strategy for designing high-performance single-atom catalysts for practical electrocatalysis applications.",Carbon,10.1016/j.carbon.2021.05.038
An Adjacent Atomic Platinum Site Enables Single-Atom Iron with High Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe modulation effect has been widely investigated to tune the electronic state of single-atomic M-N-C catalysts to enhance the activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the in-depth study of modulation effect is rarely reported for the isolated dual-atomic metal sites. Now, the catalytic activities of Fe-N4 moiety can be enhanced by the adjacent Pt-N4 moiety through the modulation effect, in which the Pt-N4 acts as the modulator to tune the 3d electronic orbitals of Fe-N4 active site and optimize ORR activity. Inspired by this principle, we design and synthesize the electrocatalyst that comprises isolated Fe-N4/Pt-N4 moieties dispersed in the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (Fe-N4/Pt-N4@NC) and exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.93 V vs. RHE and negligible activity degradation (ΔE1/2=8 mV) after 10000 cycles in 0.1 M KOH. We also demonstrate that the modulation effect is not effective for optimizing the ORR performances of Co-N4/Pt-N4 and Mn-N4/Pt-N4 systems.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202105186
Unravelling the Reaction Mechanisms of N2 Fixation on Molybdenum Nitride: A Full DFT Study from the Pristine Surface to Heteroatom Anchoring,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHTransition metal nitrides (TMNs)-based materials have attracted increasing attention in electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) because of their unique structures and inherent electronic properties. However, the eNRR mechanism on such nitrogen contained catalysts is still unclear, for example, which part of the catalyst act as the active sites, and how to achieve the optimal efficiency is also challenging. In this work, a comprehensive study was conducted to unravel the reaction mechanisms of N2 fixation on molybdenum nitride by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The activity and selectivity of eNRR on pristine (001) and (110) Mo5N6 surfaces as well as few specific numbers of heteroatom-anchored N-terminated surfaces were all evaluated and compared. It was found that the Mo and N atoms on the pristine Mo5N6 surface were both active for eNRR while following different pathways in mechanism. Moreover, the eNRR catalytic performance of Mo5N6 could be further boosted by specific metal atoms anchoring, such as single atom, metal dimer, and heterodiatom pair. Finally, a full map of eNRR mechanism on pristine and metal atom-decorated Mo5N6 surfaces was illustrated. This work not only provides a fundamental understanding of eNRR mechanism on TMNs based materials but also offers powerful strategies towards the rational design of efficient NRR electrocatalysts.",ChemSusChem,10.1002/cssc.202101014
Enabling multifunctional electrocatalysts by modifying the basal plane of unifunctional 1T′-MoS2with anchored transition metal single atoms,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Multifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are attractive for overall water-splitting, rechargeable metal-air batteries, and unitized regenerative fuel cells. A single-atom catalyst (SAC) may exhibit additional advantages over its nanoparticle counterpart, and already there have been significant advances in the development of bifunctional and trifunctional SACs for HER, ORR, and OER, but great challenges remain for their rational design. Herein, we propose a strategy to realize multifunctional SACs, i.e., modifying unifunctional materials to introduce new active sites on the surface. Specifically, by virtue of the intrinsic excellent HER performance of 1T′-MoS2, we theoretically design multifunctional SACs by anchoring appropriate transition-metal single atoms. Intriguingly, 1T′-MoS2 with supported Co single atoms (Co@MoS2) are demonstrated to be highly active for both OER and ORR with ultralow overpotentials of less than 0.3 V, ascribed to the moderate chemical activity and unique electronic structure of the Co atomic center. Consequently, combining the intrinsic HER activity of 1T′-MoS2, Co@MoS2 is proposed to be promising efficient trifunctional SACs. Further, the phase engineering on SACs is unrevealed and elucidated by comparing the properties of the Co atomic center-supported on 1T′-MoS2 and 1H-MoS2. This work provides a feasible strategy for the design of multifunctional SACs for the renewable and sustainable energy technology and provides an insight into the phase engineering on SACs.",Nanoscale,10.1039/d1nr02251b
Single-atom catalysts of TM-porphyrin for alkali oxygen batteries: reaction mechanism and universal design principle,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been intensively explored for many electrochemical reactions, but rarely in nonaqueous alkali oxygen batteries. A picture (activity trend, reaction mechanism and design principle) of SACs for nonaqueous alkali oxygen batteries remains to be built up. Here, using first-principles, we construct such a picture by systematically investigating the catalytic activities of SACs of transition metal-porphyrin (TM-porphyrin) in Li-O2batteries. Through fully exploring the possible reaction pathways, we reveal the reaction mechanism and chemical compositions of reaction products, and find that Fe/Co/Ni/Cu-porphyrin are promising cathode electrocatalysts for Li-O2batteries. The influences of various axial ligands on their catalytic performances are also studied. More importantly, based on the catalytic activities of free and axial ligand adsorbed Fe/Co/Ni/Cu-porphyrin, the adsorption free energy of LiO2is identified as a simple activity descriptor suitable for these cathode electrocatalysts. We further show that such a descriptor is also applicable for the catalytic activities of Fe/Co/Ni/Cu-porphyrin in Na-O2batteries. Our work not only provides a series of highly efficient SACs for alkali oxygen batteries, but also presents a universal design principle.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta04187h
Double Active Sites in Co-N x-C@Co Electrocatalysts for Simultaneous Production of Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by electrocatalytic water splitting is a prospective and economical route. However, the approach is severely hindered by the sluggish anodic OER, poor reactivity of electrocatalysts, and low-value-added byproducts at the anode. Herein, formaldehyde was added as an anode sacrificial agent, and a bifunctional Co-Nx-C@Co catalyst containing abundant Co-N4 sites and Co nanoparticles was successfully fabricated and evaluated as both a cathodic and an anodic material for the HER and formaldehyde selective oxidation reaction (FSOR), respectively. Co-Nx-C@Co displayed a remarkable electrocatalytic performance simultaneously for both HER and FSOR with high hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) selectivity. Density functional theory calculations combined with experiments identified that Co-N4 and Co nanoparticles were dominating active sites for CO and H2 generation, respectively. The coupling tactic of FSOR at the anode not only expedites the reaction rate of HER but also offers a high-efficiency and energy-saving means for the generation of valuable H2/CO syngas.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c08363
Atomically dispersed Fe atoms anchored on S and N-codoped carbon for efficient electrochemical denitrification,"© 2021 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Nitrate, a widespread contaminant in natural water, is a threat to ecological safety and human health. Although direct nitrate removal by electrochemical methods is efficient, the development of low-cost electrocatalysts with high reactivity remains challenging. Herein, bi-functional single-atom catalysts (SACs) were prepared with Cu or Fe active centers on an N-doped or S, N-codoped carbon basal plane for N2 or NH4+ production. The maximum nitrate removal capacity was 7,822 mg N · g−1 Fe, which was the highest among previous studies. A high ammonia Faradic efficiency (78.4%) was achieved at a low potential (−0.57 versus reversible hydrogen electrode), and the nitrogen selectivity was 100% on S-modified Fe SACs. Theoretical and experimental investigations of the S-doping charge-transfer effect revealed that strong metal-support interactions were beneficial for anchoring single atoms and enhancing cyclability. S-doping altered the coordination environment of single-atom centers and created numerous defects with higher conductivity, which played a key role in improving the catalyst activity. Moreover, interactions between defects and single-atom sites improved the catalytic performance. Thus, these findings offer an avenue for high active SAC design.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.2105628118
Hierarchical assembly strategy to tailored nanostructures of doped-carbon/Co-based catalysts for high-performance trifunctional electrocatalysis,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Developing an effective strategy to synthesize low-cost and efficient trifunctional electrocatalysts is critical to renewable energy storage and conversion but remains challenging. Herein, we report a hierarchical assembly strategy to controllably synthesize a series of doped carbon/Co-based nanocomposites with tunable morphologies and compositions. During the synthesis, a variation of urea/thiourea mass ratio exerts a dramatic effect on final nanostructures, ranging from hollow nanotube, nanosheet to nanospring. Meanwhile, Co species are successfully regulated from Co single atoms, Co nanoparticles (NPs) to Co9S8 NPs. The controllable tunability allows the optimization of trifunctional electrocatalytic performance and the establishment of structure/composition-property relationships for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Among the as-obtained materials, the heterostructure of hollow carbon nanotubes/reduced graphene oxide doped with N/S and decorated with Co9S8 NPs (Co9S8-HCT) shows superior electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability for ORR, OER, and HER in alkaline medium. Experimental and theoretical results show that the electrocatalytic promotion comes from the electronic modulation of Co9S8 from N,S-codoped nanocarbon.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.129365
Dual single-cobalt atom-based carbon electrocatalysts for efficient CO2-to-syngas conversion with industrial current densities,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Dual single-cobalt atom-based catalysts were synthesized using CoN3 sites and N dopants co-decorated hierarchically porous carbon (HPC-Co) as the matrix to immobilize cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc). CoPc interacts with N dopants and CoN3, forming N-CoPc and CoN3-CoPc sites via π–π and Co-Co interactions. HPC-Co/CoPc (5:1) produced syngas at industrial current densities (> 200 and 880 mA cm−2 for the H-type and flow cell, respectively). Rechargeable Zn-CO2 batteries based on this catalyst had current densities of 7 and 10 mA cm−2 at ideal H2/CO ratios of 2 and 3, respectively. The efficient production of syngas is attributed to synergistic catalysis between N-CoPc (for CO2 reduction) and CoN3-CoPc (for hydrogen evolution). This work presents a versatile strategy for the synthesis of dual single-atom-based carbon electrocatalysts for efficient conversion of CO2 to syngas. This strategy is superior to conventional high-temperature pyrolysis that is difficult to control the atomic dispersion of distinct metal sites.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120092
"Single transition metal atom embedded antimonene monolayers as efficient trifunctional electrocatalysts for the HER, OER and ORR: A density functional theory study","© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Highly efficient, stable and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been pursued for several decades. Herein, by employing density functional theory (DFT), a wide range of transition metal (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Ir, Pt and Au) atoms anchored on antimonene (Sb monolayer) with a single Sb vacancy as single-atom catalysts (SACs) were investigated for their HER, OER and ORR performance. The results indicate that the defective Sb monolayer can be stable. Some TM@Sb monolayers show excellent stability and good electrical conductivity, beneficial for electron transfer during electrocatalytic reactions. The Ir@ and Pt@Sb monolayers exhibit excellent HER performance, both with about -0.01 eV of ΔG∗H. The d band centre of the TM@Sb monolayer can be used to describe the binding strength between substrates and intermediates directly. The best OER electrocatalyst is the Pt@Sb monolayer, which shows an overpotential (ηOER) of 0.48 V. In contrast, the best ORR electrocatalyst is the Ag@Sb monolayer with an ηORR of 0.50 V, followed by Pd@, Rh@, Cd@ and Pt@Sb monolayers. Compared with pristine antimonene, only the noble metal atom could improve its OER and ORR performance effectively, and the Pt@Sb monolayer can be a trifunctional electrocatalyst for the HER/OER/ORR. Therefore, our calculations highlight a new type of SAC based on antimonene, which can be useful for energy conversion and storage.",Nanoscale,10.1039/d1nr02235k
NO Electroreduction by Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with Chalcogen Vacancies,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHNitric oxide electroreduction reaction (NOER) is one of the most attractive routes for ammonia synthesis and NOx-related pollutant treatment. However, current research on NOER catalysts mainly focus on noble metals and single atom catalysts, while low-cost transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are rarely considered, let alone their product selectivity. Herein, using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the performance of a series of single-layer TMDs (MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, TaTe2 and WTe2) in the 1T’ phase as electrocatalysts for NOER. Our results reveal that defective 1T’-MoS2 and 1T’-MoSe2 monolayers (with the most common sulphur and selenium vacancies, respectively) exhibit excellent activity for NOER as well as high selectivity for ammonia, which can be correspondingly yielded at 0 and −0.06 V potentials, comparable to the best Pt-based and single atom catalysts. Furthermore, these two catalysts efficiently suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Thus, single-layer TMDs synthesized with chalcogen vacancies may serve as efficient catalysts for electrochemical ammonia synthesis from pollutants and electrocatalytic denitrification.",ChemElectroChem,10.1002/celc.202100790
Atomically dispersed low-cost transition metals catalyze efficient hydrogen evolution on two-dimensional SnO nanosheets,"© 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCTwo-dimensional (2D) electrocatalyst plays an important role in hydrogen production via water splitting. In this work, the first-principles calculation was used to investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of transition metal (TM) single atom catalysts (SACs) on 2D SnO nanosheets. Among the TM considered (TM = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Pt), V, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Pt can effectively improve the catalytic activity of SnO. More importantly, the low-cost Co can exhibit promising HER performance with the Gibbs free energy as low as ~0.015 eV, which is competitive with the precious catalyst Pt. The theoretical exchange current densities of Co SACs can reach ~10−16 A/site. The exciting HER activity is mainly facilitated through the d-d hybridization between the TM and Sn atoms on the SnO surface, which introduces new electron states near the Fermi level. Our work highlights the complexity and diversity of the effect of TM SACs on SnO nanosheets and implies their potential applications as efficient HER electrocatalysts.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.06.105
Single-atom catalysts based on TiN for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction: A theoretical study,"© the Owner Societies.The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for water splitting is crucial for the sustainable production of clean hydrogen fuel, while the high cost of Pt catalysts impedes its commercialization. Herein, we have performed a systematic theoretical study on the electrocatalytic HER over single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on low-cost TiN. Specifically, the TiN(100) surface with a Ti or N vacancy has been considered as the support. 20 transition-metal (TM) atoms and 3 nonmetallic atoms are embedded into the Ti or N vacancy, accordingly denoted as M@Tiv or M@Nv. All the single atoms can be stabilized by the surface vacancies, controlled by the adjustable chemical potential. Interestingly, for TM-embedded TiN(100), the hydrogen binding is much stronger over M@Nv than M@Tiv, which can be attributed to the more localized d states of the TM atoms anchored by the N vacancies, indicating a strong coordination effect. Among 43 catalysts, 10 (Ni, Zn, Nb, Mo, Rh@Tiv, and Au, Pd, W, Mo, B@Nv) were predicted to have high HER catalytic activity with near-zero hydrogen adsorption free energy. For the further gaseous hydrogen evolution, Zn@Tiv can adopt both Tafel (with an energy barrier of 0.68 eV) and Heyrovsky mechanisms, while the others may prefer the Heyrovsky mechanism. This work provides a promising strategy to realize cost-efficient electrocatalysts for the HER, and highlights the important role of the local coordination environment for SACs.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d1cp01861b

Theoretical screening of 2D materials supported transition-metal single atoms as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2021The development of noble metal-free catalysts with high electrocatalytic activity to replace noble metal-based catalysts is essential innovation point of the future hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, we systematically investigate the electrocatalytic activity of single-atom catalysts (SACs) on two-dimensional (2D) substrate materials based on density functional theory (DFT). Through the phonon dispersion curves and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation calculations, the dynamic and thermal stability of BCN, B2O, C3N2 and CN monolayers are estimated. The catalytic activity of SACs in HER is described by the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) of hydrogen adsorption, without considering other processes involved in the HER. This descriptor is helpful for the rapid screening of efficient electrochemical hydrogen production catalysts. The results show that the catalytic performance of SACs in HER is closely related to the electronegativity of the active center site and its adjacent atoms. The ΔGH* of Ti@B2O, V@B2O, Sc@B2O, Mn@BCN, Sc@BCN, Cr@BCN, Sc@CN and Fe@C3N2 systems is close to 0 eV, and they have good stability and high reactivity, indicating that they are potential electrocatalysts for HER. Our findings contribute to the development of low cost noble metal-free catalysts and provide theoretical guidance for the design and screening of SACs on 2D substrate materials.",Materialia,10.1016/j.mtla.2021.101168
Construction of Dual-Site Atomically Dispersed Electrocatalysts with Ru-C5 Single Atoms and Ru-O4 Nanoclusters for Accelerated Alkali Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Rationally integrating multi-active sites into one ideal catalyst is an effective approach to accelerate multistep reactions by synergic catalysis. Herein, a universal and facile room temperature impregnation strategy is developed to construct Ru atomically dispersed catalyst (Ru ADC) with Ru-C5 single atoms and Ru oxide nanoclusters (≈1.5 nm), which can also be extended to prepare Ir, Rh, Pt, Au, and Mo atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs). It is found that the obtained Ru ADC largely boosts alkali hydrogen evolution by concerted catalysis between single atoms and sub-nanoclusters, which only needs an overpotential of 18 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Further mechanistic studies reveal that Ru-C5 single atoms and Ru oxide nanoclusters with Ru-O4 configuration in one catalyst can synergically boost water molecule capture, water dissociation, and hydrogen release. This study opens up a simple method to synthesize dual-site metal ADCs for synergic catalysis of typical multistep reactions.",Small,10.1002/smll.202101163
Dual-Sites Coordination Engineering of Single Atom Catalysts for Flexible Metal–Air Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHDual-sites single atom catalysts hold promise for efficiently regulating multiple reaction processes and explicitly explaining the underlying mechanisms. However, delicate atomic engineering for dual-site single atom catalysts remains a huge challenge. Herein, atomically dispersed Fe-Ni single atoms embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (FeNi SAs/NC) are successfully developed with extraordinary activity for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER). The atomic FeNi SAs/NC catalyst displays high onset potential (0.98 V) and half-wave potential (0.84 V) for the ORR, as well as, low overpotential of (270 mV) at 10 mA cm−2 for the OER. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the Fe site as the active center can facilitate the four-electron reaction process, while Ni sites regulate the electronic structure of Fe sites and further reduce the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. In addition, the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix prevents the metal atoms from aggregation and corrosion, leading to the improvement of catalyst durability. As a proof of concept, flexible quasi-solid-state zinc– and aluminum–air batteries assembled with the FeNi SAs/NC catalyst exhibit superior peak power densities and discharging specific capacities outperforming the commercial Pt/C. This work provides rational guidance for the synthesis of bifunctional electrocatalysts in next-generation energy devices for flexible consumer electronics.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202101242
Flash Bottom-Up Arc Synthesis of Nanocarbons as a Universal Route for Fabricating Single-Atom Electrocatalysts,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHDespite considerable development in the field of single-atom catalysts (SACs) on carbon-based materials, the reported strategies for synthesizing SACs generally rely on top-down approaches, which hinder achieving both simple and universal synthesis routes that are simultaneously applicable to various metals and nanocarbons. Here, a universal strategy for fabricating nanocarbon based-SACs using a flash bottom-up arc discharge method to mitigate these issues is reported. The ionization of elements and their recombination process during arc discharge allows the simultaneous incorporation of single metal atoms (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt) into the crystalline carbon lattice during the formation of carbon nanohorns (CNHs) and N-doped arc graphene. The coordination environment around the Co atoms of Co1/CNH can be modulated by a mild post-treatment with NH3. As a result, Co1/CNH exhibits good oxygen reduction reaction activity, showing a 1.92 times higher kinetic current density value than the commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline media. In a single cell experiment, Co1/CNH exhibits the highest maximum power density of 472 mW cm−2 compared to previously reported nonprecious metal-based SACs.",Small Methods,10.1002/smtd.202100239
Fe-N-C Electrocatalysts with Densely Accessible Fe-N4 Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbHThe development of iron and nitrogen co-doped carbon (Fe-N-C) electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is a grand challenge due to the low density of accessible Fe-N4 sites. Here, an in situ trapping strategy using nitrogen-rich molecules (e.g., melamine, MA) is demonstrated to enhance the amount of accessible Fe-N4 sites in Fe-N-C electrocatalysts. The melamine molecules can participate in the coordination of Fe ions in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks to form Fe-N6 sites within precursors. These Fe-N6 sites are then converted into atomically dispersed Fe-N4 sites during a pyrolytic process. Remarkably, the Fe-N-C/MA exhibits a high single-atom Fe content (3.5 wt.%), a large surface area (1160 m2 g−1), and a high density of accessible FeN4 sites (45.7 × 1019 sites g−1). As a result, Fe-N-C/MA shows a much enhanced ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.83 V (vs the reversible hydrogen electrode) in a 0.5 m H2SO4 electrolyte solution and a good performance in a PEMFC system with an activity of 80 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V under 1.0 bar H2/air. This work offers a promising approach toward high-performance carbon-based ORR electrocatalysts.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202102420
Exploring the Dominant Role of Atomic- and Nano-Ruthenium as Active Sites for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Both Acidic and Alkaline Media,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHRu nanoparticles (NPs) and single atoms (SAs)-based materials have been investigated as alternative electrocatalysts to Pt/C for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Exploring the dominant role of atomic- and nano-ruthenium as active sites in acidic and alkaline media is very necessary for optimizing the performance. Herein, an electrocatalyst containing both Ru SAs and NPs anchored on defective carbon (RuSA+NP/DC) has been synthesized via a Ru–alginate metal–organic supramolecules conversion method. RuSA+NP/DC exhibits low overpotentials of 16.6 and 18.8 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Notably, its mass activities are dramatically improved, which are about 1.1 and 2.4 times those of Pt/C at an overpotential of 50 mV in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. Theoretical calculations reveal that Ru SAs own the most appropriate H* adsorption strength and thus, plays a dominant role for HER in acid electrolyte, while Ru NPs facilitate the dissociation of H2O that is the rate-determining step in alkaline electrolyte, leading to a remarkable HER activity.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.202004516
Single-atom nickel anchored on surface of molybdenum disulfide for efficient hydrogen evolution,"© 2021Owing to the advantages with both uniform dispersity of active sites like liquid and recycling of solid catalysts, single-atom electro-catalysts improve their catalytic activities remarkably over conventional catalysts. Herein, single-atom nickel was assembled on surface of MoS2 to form Ni-anchored MoS2 (Nisa-MoS2) electro-catalyst by means of thermal balance at 200 °C for 24 h. High-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping displayed single-atoms of nickel were uniformly dispersed on MoS2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated the hexagonal structure of crystalline MoS2 with space group of P 36/mmc was formed and the thermal balance treatment facilitated the crystallization of plane (0 0 2) in the presence of Ni(II) solution. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) detected the Ni(II) 2p binding energy on surface of MoS2. The over-potential of 196 mV and Tafel slope of 87 mV dec−1 for Nisa-MoS2 electrocatalyst has been achieved for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 mol/L KOH solution, whereas pristine MoS2 possessed an over-potential of 462 mV and Tafel slope of 433 mV dec−1 for HER, indicating the single-atoms of Ni improved the HER activity significantly. HER on Nisa-MoS2 electro-catalyst follows Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism in alkaline electrolyte. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and thiocyanate (SCN−) are used to identify the active sites. The results displayed the over-potentials remarkably shifted negatively by ~ 50 mV in the presence of EDTA and SCN−, suggesting the single-atoms of nickel were active sites. The impact structure of MoS2 was fabricated after single nickel atoms were anchored on MoS2, the new electronic states led to the high catalytic performance of the confined single nickel atoms, and the confined single nickel atoms could in turn affect the intrinsic activity of MoS2. It is the synergistic effect between Ni and MoS2 that reduced the energy barrier and promoted the HER effectively.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry,10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.115359
Designing efficient single-atomic catalysts for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis via a general two-step strategy,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The rational design of efficient electrocatalysts based on comprehensive mechanistic insights is crucial to widespread penetration of future sustainable and eco-friendly energy technologies. Herein, via systematic first-principles calculations, we propose a general two-step strategy for developing highly active single-atom catalyst (SACs) supported on a prototypical substrate (g-C3N4) for bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our results show that the intrinsic activity can be properly evaluated by a robust screening rule, and, particularly, the descriptor can be readily calculated by a few handy and basic properties. According to the knowledge, we propose an effective approach (i.e., creating an N vacancy in the cavity of g-C3N4) that enables further activity improvement. Specifically, the predicted ORR/OER activity on Ag and Rh based SACs are comparable or even outperforms that of respective benchmark catalysts. This study not only provides several promising candidates for bifunctional ORR/OER, but also directs a new avenue for rational design of high-performance catalysts.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.149779

In this work, 14 kinds of nonmetal (NM) single atom doped 2D Ti2CO2 catalysts were screened by DFT method. It was found that the surface doping of nonmetal single atom can effectively promote the HER activity of Ti2CO2. Among them, Ti2CO2 with rich fluorine termination groups realizing efficient electrocatalytic HER has been successfully verified by recent experiments. Through the analysis of electronic structure, it is found that nonmetal single atom valence electron number and bader electron transfer coupled electron descriptor is suitable to accurately predict the trend of 2D NM-Ti2CO2 catalytic activity for HER. The large-scale screening of this work and the mechanism analysis of nonmetal single atom surface doping enhanced of 2D Ti2CO2 HER activity not only provide a database reference for the experimental synthesis of NM-MXenes HER catalyst, but also provide a electronical mechanism guidance for the extensive design of new NM- MXenes materials.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.149778

The in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu-Au interface sites serve as the intrinsic active centers, which can facilitate the activated adsorption of CO2 and stabilize the *COOH intermediate.",Science China Materials,10.1007/s40843-020-1583-4
Achieving ultrahigh electrocatalytic NH3 yield rate on Fe-doped Bi2WO6 electrocatalyst,"© 2020, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.NH3, derived from electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), is promising to satisfy the need of food production and serve as a carbon-free liquid energy carrier in the near future. Yet major challenges remain in enhancing NH3 yield rate and conversion efficiency of available electrocatalysts. This work achieved an ultrahigh electrocatalytic NH3 yield rate on the 0.50Fe-Bi2WO6 catalyst by a facile Fe-doped strategy. Up to 289 µg·h−1·mgcat−1 of NH3 formation rate was obtained at −0.75 V vs. RHE, which was reliably quantized by indophenol blue and 1H NMR methods. The impressive result is an order of magnitude higher than that of the reported Fe- and Bi-based catalysts, even more superior than the result of single atom Ru catalyst. The key of the outstanding NRR behaviors on the 0.50Fe-Bi2WO6 catalyst is the significant hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) suppression and the synergy between Bi and Fe, which can effectively modulate the electron distribution and accelerate the electron transport. This work endows a new insight to further explore the high-performance electrocatalysts toward NRR. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research,10.1007/s12274-020-3276-9
Ultrafine ruthenium-iridium alloy nanoparticles well-dispersed on N-rich carbon frameworks as efficient hydrogen-generation electrocatalysts,"© 2020The production of green energy, in this case, hydrogen (H2), from water electrolysis highly depends on the rational design of highly efficient yet cost-effective electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Precious-metal-based materials offer particularly prominent catalytic activities but suffer from the high cost. Thus, it is strongly desirable to develop low-metal-content composites as catalysts. In addition, fabricating an alloyed structure can greatly enhance the performance through synergy. Here, a novel nanohybrid of nanostructured RuIr alloys (~3.87 nm) with a low loading uniformly decorated on a highly porous and N-rich carbon matrix (RuIr@NrC) is constructed through a one-pot pyrolysis route. Taking advantage of the Ru/Ir single atoms, ultrafine RuIr nanostructure, high-porosity carbon substrate, and abundantly doped N, as well as their synergy, the as-formed composite demonstrates outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the HER under both basic and acidic conditions, with overpotentials of only 28 and 9 mV at 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Furthermore, the as-prepared RuIr@NrC exhibits robust durability for 2000 cycles. This structure outperforms its corresponding monometallic counterparts and many typical catalytic materials and is even comparable to commercial Pt/C. Notably, a high mass activity of 6.97 A mgnoble metal−1 is obtained, which is nearly ten times that of 20% Pt/C. This result shows the outstanding potential of RuIr@NrC for application in commercial water-splitting electrolyzers.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2020.128105
Nitrogen and atomic Fe dual-doped porous carbon nanocubes as superior electrocatalysts for acidic H2-O2 PEMFC and alkaline Zn-air battery,"© 2020 Science PressAir cathodes with high electrocatalytic activity are vital for developing H2/O2 proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and Zn-air batteries. However, the state-of-the-art air cathodes suffer from either limited catalytic activity or high cost, which thus hinder their applications. Herein, we designed ZIF-8 derived nitrogen and atomic iron dual-doped porous carbon nanocubes as high-quality catalysts for ORR, through a novel gas-doping approach. The porous carbon nanocubic architecture and abundant Fe-Nx active species endow ZIF-8 derived single atomic iron catalyst (PCN-A@Fe SA) with superior catalytic activity, and surpass Pt/C and a majority of the reported catalysts. Both XAS and DFT calculations suggest that Fe2+N4 moieties are the main active centers that are favorable for oxygen affinity and OH* intermediate desorption, which can result in promising catalytic performance. Most importantly, PCN-A@Fe SA can achieve power density of 514 mW cm−2 as cathodic catalyst in a PEMFC and discharge peak power density of 185 mW cm−2 in an alkaline Zn-air battery.

High-temperature treatment to engineer the single-atom Pt coordination environment towards highly efficient hydrogen evolution,"© 2020 Science PressDevelopment of high-performance and cost-effective catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) play crucial role in the growing hydrogen economy. Recently, the atomically dispersed metal catalysts have attracted increasing attention due to their ultimate atom utilization and great potential for highly cost-effective and high-efficiency HER electrocatalyst. Herein, we propose a high-temperature treatment strategy to furtherly improve the HER performance of atomically dispersed Pt-based catalyst. Interestingly, after appropriate high-temperature treatment on the atomically dispersed Pt0.8@CN, the Pt species on the designed N-doped porous carbon substrate with rich defect sites can be re-dispersed to single atom state with new coordination environment. The obtained Pt0.8@CN-1000 shows superior HER performance with overpotential of 13 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and mass activity of 11,284 mA/mgPt at −0.1 V, much higher than that of the pristine Pt0.8@CN and commercial Pt/C catalyst. The experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the high-temperature treatment induces the restructuring of coordination environment and then the optimized Pt electronic state leads to the enhanced HER performances. This work affords new strategy and insights to develop the atomically dispersed high-efficiency catalysts.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2020.11.004
ZnO monolayer supported single atom catalysts for efficient nitrogen electroreduction to ammonia,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Efficient and sustainable ammonia production via electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) requires low-cost catalysts with high stability, high selectivity, and high activity. Using first-principles calculations, we assessed the eNRR activities of single atom catalysts (SACs) constructed with a transition metal atom TM substituting a Zn atom in ZnO monolayer (TM/ZnO). Three criteria, the SACs' stability, the selectivity of eNRR relative to hydrogen evolution, and the limiting potential, were adopted to screen efficient eNRR SACs among 17 different models. Two SACs, V/ZnO and Mo/ZnO, survived the screening. eNRR on both SACs proceeds along the distal pathway, with limiting potentials −0.26 and −0.65 V, at the first and last hydrogenation step, respectively. Electronic structure analysis demonstrated that the stable N–N triple bond was activated by the back-donation mechanism. Our results illustrate that ZnO monolayer is a non-toxic and low-cost SAC support for eNRR, while V/ZnO and Mo/ZnO are promising electrochemical catalysts to produce ammonia.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.149682
Promoting the conversion of CO2to CH4: Via synergistic dual active sites,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Carbon-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) have shown promising applications in the conversion of CO2 into CO. However, the deep reduction process for the production of high-value hydrocarbons is largely limited due to the weak activation of CO. Herein, on the basis of first-principles calculations, a simple coordination regulation method of the active site is proposed to improve the conversion of CO2. Taking NiN4 as an example, by introducing heteroatoms (B, C, O, P, and S atoms), we reveal that NiN3B can effectively capture *CO and further convert to CH4 with an ultralow limiting potential of -0.42 V. The excellent catalytic performance is probably attributed to the formed synergistic dual active sites between non-metal B and metal Ni atoms. Moreover, NiN3B can maintain good stability and the catalytic performance can be further enhanced by increasing the B-doping concentration. This work demonstrates that coordination regulation is an effective strategy to improve the performance of single-atom catalysts and paves a possible way to advance the development of non-Cu-based CO2RR electrocatalysts for high-value hydrocarbon products.",Nanoscale,10.1039/d1nr02582a
Computational screening of bifunctional single atom electrocatalyst based on boron nitride nanoribbon for water splitting,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Designing bifunctional single atom catalyst is a promising strategy for developing highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. In this work, we systematically investigate the catalytic activity of single transition metal (TM) atom suppported on defective boron nitride nanoribbon (TMN4-BNNR, TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Mo, Ru and Rh) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by using density functional theory. Our computation demonstrated all TM atoms can bind strongly with uncoordinated four N atoms on N-doped defective BNNR. Furthermore, FeN4-BNNR and RhN4-BNNR are screened as the most efficient catalysts for both HER and OER, with the low HER/OER overpotential being 0.07/0.52 V and 0.18/0.27 V. The activity of TMN4-BNNR is constrained by the binding strength toward intermediates and depends on the electron-donating ability and d band center of catalyst. This work proposes a cost-effective and high-performance single atom catalyst for water electrochemical splitting.",Applied Catalysis A: General,10.1016/j.apcata.2021.118235

Using the first principle density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamic calculations, we systematically explored the activity, selectivity, and thermodynamic stability of the single-atom or tetra-nuclear metal clusters of Fe and Ru supported on Nb2C MXene modified by oxygen (fluorine) functional groups, resulting in one excellent electrocatalyst (labeling as Ru/Nb2CO2) for NRR. The obtained Ru/Nb2CO2 catalyst mainly undergoes electroreduction of nitrogen that proceeds via an enzymatic hybrid mechanism due to high selectivity (99.9%) and low ΔGPDS (ΔGPDS = 0.59 eV), and the catalyst also has superior stability at 500 K, suggesting Ru/Nb2CO2 has high promising performance for electrocatalytic synthesis of ammonia.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c02477
N and O multi-coordinated vanadium single atom with enhanced oxygen reduction activity,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Recently, atomically dispersed transition-metal single atom in nitrogen-doped carbon matrix as electrocatalysts has aroused general interest. However, there is no report about vanadium single atom for ORR in the literature. According to d-band center theory for transition-metals, the performance of catalysts is regulated by the electronic structure of the catalytic center which determines the intermediate adsorption kinetics. Indeed, the valence of vanadium is variable, its electron structure could be modulated by an appropriate coordination structure. Here, a novel method is developed to prepare the N and O co-coordinated vanadium single atom (V-N1O4) embedded in the carbon matrix. The catalyst displays a half-wave potential of 865 mV in base solution which surpasses 20% Pt/C, and also shows a high power density of 180 mW/cm2 in Zn-air batteries. DFT calculations reveal that the N and O coordination configuration could regulate the electron structure and geometry of vanadium to boost the electrocatalytic activity.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2021.03.074
Boosting Pd-catalysis for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO on Bi-Pd single atom alloy nanodendrites,"© 2020Pd is a catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO but often disturbed by H2 and formate formation at low overpotentials due to its strong affinity to H atoms. Herein, guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Bi-Pd single atom alloy (SAA) nanodendrites (NDs) with Bi atomically dispersed in Pd matrices have been developed for efficient CO2 reduction to CO. The Faradic efficiencies (FEs) of CO on the Bi6Pd94-SAA ND catalyst reach 90.5 % and 91.8 % in H-type and gas diffusion flow cells with overpotentials of only 290 and 200 mV, respectively, which are among the best of the reported Pd-based electrocatalysts. The greatly enhanced CO formation on the Bi6Pd94-SAA NDs can be attributed to the increased reaction barriers for H2 formation due to a lower H coverage resulted from Bi doping, and the decreased free energy for *COOH generation which is a key intermediate for CO production.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119783

For the practical applications of SACs, development of facile synthetic methods and analytical techniques is highly useful. Here, single-atom copper has been successfully anchored on sulfur sites of doped graphite foam via an underpotential deposition strategy. By this strategy, the loading amount of Cu SACs can be regulated through tuning the deposition potential, the S contents of the doped graphite foam and the concentration of Cu precursor; moreover, the regulation is perfectly in line with Nernst equation combined with Langmuir adsorption model. Importantly, a stripping voltammetry method is successfully developed for the first time to in-line quantitatively analyze the resultant Cu SACs. Our Cu SACs exhibit remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a half-wave potential of 0.862 V (vs RHE) and long-term stability.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120028
Promoted alkaline hydrogen evolution by an N-doped Pt-Ru single atom alloy,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Since water dissociation and H desorption kinetics essentially determine the performance of the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), rationally regulating surface adsorption behavior to achieve a superior catalytic surface is always challenging for catalysts. Herein, N-doped Pt-Ru single atom alloy electrocatalysts were constructed by dispersing diluted Pt single atoms onto Ru nanoparticles by thermal annealing in an ammonium atmosphere. The prepared (Ru-N)@Pt can substantially boost the alkaline HER catalysis of Ru nanoparticles and deliver an impressive overpotential of only 15 mV at 10 mA cm−2. X-ray-absorption fine structure characterization confirms that the doped N species have bonding interaction with both Ru and Pt sites. Theoretical calculations reveal that N incorporation helps strengthen the interfacial interaction between H2O and Ru sites by precise orbital engineering, while the Pt sites facilitate the H2desorption kinetics. This work not only provides an effective strategy to construct single atom alloy electrocatalysts for a high-performance alkaline HER, but also sheds light on the understanding of the reaction mechanism at the atomic level.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta03593b
Exceptional Electrochemical HER Performance with Enhanced Electron Transfer between Ru Nanoparticles and Single Atoms Dispersed on a Carbon Substrate,"© 2021 The Authors. Angewandte Chemie International Edition published by Wiley-VCH GmbHPrecisely regulating the electronic structures of metal active species is highly desirable for electrocatalysis. However, carbon with inert surface provide weak metal–support interaction, which is insufficient to modulate the electronic structures of metal nanoparticles. Herein, we propose a new method to control the electrocatalytic behavior of supported metal nanoparticles by dispersing single metal atoms on an O-doped graphene. Ideal atomic metal species are firstly computationally screened. We then verify this concept by deposition of Ru nanoparticles onto an O-doped graphene decorated with single metal atoms (e.g., Fe, Co, and Ni) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Consistent with theoretical predictions, such hybrid catalysts show outstanding HER performance, much superior to other reported electrocatalysts such as the state-of-the-art Pt/C.

Rational Design and Effective Control of Gold-Based Bimetallic Electrocatalyst for Boosting CO2 Reduction Reaction: A First-Principles Study,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHElectrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective strategy converting CO2 to value-added products. Au is regarded as an efficient catalyst for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, and the introduction of Pd can tune CO2RR properties due to its strong affinity to CO. Herein, Au−Pd bimetallic electrocatalysts with different metal ratio were firstly investigated on CO2RR mechanism by using density functional theory. The Au monolayer over Pd substrate and single Pd atom on Au(111) were found to show better CO2RR selectivity against hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on this, various single-atom catalysts on Au(111) and core–shell models with top Au monolayer were designed to study their CO2RR performance. The results indicated that Pt, Cu, and Rh substrates below Au monolayer could enhance the activity and selectivity for CO production compared to pure Au, in which the limiting potential reduced from −0.74 to −0.63, −0.69, and −0.71 V, respectively. The single Pd embedded on Au(111) could adjust the adsorption strength, which provided an effective site to receive and further reduce CO to CH3OH and CH4 at a low limiting potential of −0.61 V, and also avoided catalyst poisoning due to the over-strengthened CO adsorption caused by high Pd proportion on the surface. In addition, the adsorption energy of COOH was observed as a better CO2RR reactivity descriptor than the common CO adsorption when establishing scaling relationship, which could avoid the fitting error caused by intermediate physisorption of CO.",ChemSusChem,10.1002/cssc.202100785
Enhanced performance of atomically dispersed dual-site Fe-Mn electrocatalysts through cascade reaction mechanism,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Constructing and excavating single atom catalysts with high-density active sites and long-life durability for energy storage and conversion devices still remain bestially challenges. In this paper, a novel dual-site electrocatalyst with atomically dispersed Fe/Mn-Nx-C dual metal sites embedded in N-doped carbon matrix is successfully designed and synthesized, which exhibits a state-of-the-art oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.88 V (vs. RHE) as well as a superior stability. Besides, the Fe/Mn-Nx-C catalyst reaches a high power density of 208.6 mW cm−2 and a specific energy density of 825.5 W h kg-1 when this catalyst is employed in Zn-air battery, which is superior to most of the reported non-precious catalysts. Furthermore, theoretical DFT calculations reveal the excellent performance is induced through a synergic dual-site cascade mechanism, which overcomes the issue of low adsorption energy (Eads) of *OH on Fe-Nx site, followed by transfer of the *OH to adjacent Mn-Nx sites. As a result, the first three steps during ORR more favored occur on the Fe-Nx sites instead of the Mn sites to generate *OOH and *O intermediates due to the lower energy barriers. This mechanism is further approved by addition of methanol to verify the preferred adsorption of *OH on the Mn-Nx site.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120021
Single Mn Atom Anchored on Nitrogen-Doped Graphene as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle Mn atom on nitrogen-doped graphene (MnN4-G) has exhibited good structural stability and high activity for the adsorption and dissociation of an O2 molecule, becoming a promising single-atom catalyst (SAC) candidate for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the catalytic activity of MnN4-G for the ORR and the optimal reaction pathway remain obscure. In this work, density-functional theory calculations were employed to comprehensively investigate all the possible pathways and intermediate reactions of the ORR on MnN4-G. The feasible active sites and the most stable adsorption configurations of the intermediates and transition states during the ORR were identified. Screened from all the possibilities, three optimal four-electron O2 hydrogenation pathways with an ultralow energy barrier of 0.13 eV were discovered that are energetically more favorable than direct O2 dissociation pathways. Analysis of the free energy diagram further verified the thermodynamical feasibility of the three pathways. Thus, MnN4-G possesses superior ORR activity.

Computational identification of B substitutional doped C9N4 monolayer for electrocatalytic N2 reduction,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Developing high-performance electrocatalysts with low overpotential and high selectivity for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is vital to the sustainable production of ammonia (NH3) at mild conditions. Recently, various B interstitial doped porous graphitic carbon nitride have been identified as efficient electrocatalysts for NRR, while the B substitutional doping has been rarely explored. In this work, three B doped C9N4 monolayers have been designed (BC, BN, and Bint), and their efficiencies toward NRR are evaluated by performing comprehensive first-principles calculations. Our results clearly reveal that N2 can be sufficiently activated on the BN and Bint monolayers due to the ”acceptance-donation” interaction, and prefers to be reduced to NH3 via the alternating mechanism. Particularly, BN monolayer shows superior catalytic activity with a rather low overpotential of 0.12 V comparing to Bint monolayer (0.56 V). Moreover, we find that this proposed BN monolayer has not only great thermal and dynamic stabilities but also excellent suppression effect on the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. These theoretical findings suggest that B substitutional doping strategy might be another direction for the design of high-performance B-based NRR eletrocatalysts.",Molecular Catalysis,10.1016/j.mcat.2021.111726
"Can N, S Cocoordination Promote Single Atom Catalyst Performance in CO2RR?

Taking the regular Fe porphyrin (Fe-N4 porphyrin) as a probe, the study reveals that the introduction of opposable S atoms into N coordination (Fe-N2S2 porphyrin) allows for an appropriate electronic structural optimization on active sites. Owing to the additional orbitals around the Fermi level and the abundant Fe (Formula presented.) orbital occupation after S substitution, N, S cocoordination can effectively tune SACs and thus facilitating protonation of intermediates during CO2RR. CO2RR mechanisms lead to possible C1 products via two-, six-, and eight-electron pathways are systematically elucidated on Fe-N4 porphyrin and Fe-N2S2 porphyrin. Fe-N4 porphyrin yields the most favorable product of HCOOH with a limiting potential of −0.70 V. Fe-N2S2 porphyrin exhibits low limiting potentials of −0.38 and −0.40 V for HCOOH and CH3OH, respectively, surpassing those of most Cu-based catalysts and SACs. Hence, the N, S cocoordination might provide better catalytic environment than regular N coordination for SACs in CO2RR. This work demonstrates Fe-N2S2 porphyrin as a high-performance CO2RR catalyst, and highlights N, S cocoordination regulation as an effective approach to fine tune high atomically dispersed electrocatalysts.",Small,10.1002/smll.202100949

To elucidate the origin of the exceptional activity of atomically dispersed Fe-N-C catalyst in CRR, we have performed operando 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopic studies on a model single-Fe-atom catalyst with a well-defined N coordination environment. Combining with operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the in situ-generated four pyrrolic nitrogen atom-coordinated low-spin Fe(I) (LS FeIN4) featuring monovalent iron is identified as the reactive center for the conversion of CO2 to CO. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations reveal that the optimal binding strength of CO2 to the LS FeIN4 site, with strong orbital interactions between the singly occupied dz2 orbital of the Fe(I) site and the singly occupied π∗ orbital of [COOH] fragment, is the key factor for the excellent CRR performance.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.1c01621
Single Metal Atom Supported on N-Doped 2D Nitride Black Phosphorus: An Efficient Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Evolution and Oxygen Reduction Reactions,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyStudies on the application of two-dimensional black phosphorus (BP) nanocrystals in electrocatalysis have been paid much attention. In this work, we designed a single-atom catalyst (SAC) in which transition-metal atoms were supported on the N-doped BP (denoted as MNx-BP, M = Fe, Co, Ni;x= 0-3) and systematically studied their catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline conditions by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The DFT calculation results indicated that the catalytic activity of MNx-BP is significantly affected by the number of doped N atoms surrounding the single-metal center. The coordination of N atoms adjusts the adsorption strength of oxygenated intermediates over the metal center, thus affecting the catalytic performance of MNx-BP. In particular, the SAC of CoN3-BP exhibited the highest activity for OER (the overpotential η value was 0.48 V for the OER), while NiN3-BP has the highest activity for ORR (the overpotential η value was 0.44 V for the ORR). This work provided a new perspective on the design of a single-atom catalyst loaded on BP for the OER and ORR processes.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c02193
Construction of Cr-embedded graphyne electrocatalyst for highly selective reduction of CO2 to CH4: A DFT study,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The design of advanced electrocatalysts is key for capturing chemically inert CO2 for conversion into value-added products (e.g., fuel) and to effectively mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and energy crisis with high standards of sustainability. However, control of product selectivity at a low overpotential is a challenge. In this work, the electrocatalyzing potential of different single transition metals (including Ti, V, Cr, and Mn) was explored in the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) based on density functional theory (DFT). The efficiency of CRR was examined for each transition metal in relation to their reaction intermediates (COOH, CO, and CHO) after being embedded into graphyne (GY) systems. Accordingly, embedding Cr into GY is the most efficient option for the CRR to produce CH4 with an ultralow limiting potential of −0.29 V based on reaction energies and barriers. For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), CO2 is more advantageous to preferentially occupy the activation site than H2 on Cr-GY to reflect their differences in the adsorption energy (-0.83 vs. −0.38 eV). At the same time, Cr-GY can effectively inhibit the HER in the CRR process with the limiting potential of HER as −0.34 V. The overall results of this research are expected to deliver a new path for the development of low-potential electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for reduction of CO2.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.128857
Modulating interfacial charge distribution of single atoms confined in molybdenum phosphosulfide heterostructures for high efficiency hydrogen evolution,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The interfacial charge of active centers in heterogeneous catalysts modulates the sorption–desorption of intermediates. However, it is challenging to bridge the interfacial charge distribution and catalytic activity. Herein, a facile galvanostatic deposition strategy is used to anchor cost-effective ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) into MoS2/MoP heterosturctures on carbon cloth (CC@MoS2/MoP/Ru SAs). Electrochemical test of CC@MoS2/MoP/Ru SAs reveals superior alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with low overpotential of 45 and 114 mV at the current of −10 and −100 mA cmgeo–2, respectively. The CC@MoS2/MoP/Ru SAs also exhibit high stability for at least 100 h. Dual-pathway kinetic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation clearly unravel the importance of synergy and charge redistribution between the interfaces of MoS2/MoP and Ru SAs, which modulate adsorption and desorption of intermediates. This work correlates the synergy in conjunction with interfacial charge distribution to promote catalytic activity, taking as a guide to get new insight into the design of advanced electrocatalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.128834
Monolithic Co-N-C membrane integrating Co atoms and clusters as a self-supporting multi-functional electrode for solid-state zinc–air batteries and self-powered water splitting,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.For practical applications in electrochemical devices such as zinc air batteries and alkaline water electrolyzers, an efficient electrode design with satisfactory multifunctional catalytic activity is a pivotal prerequisite. Herein, a self-supporting monolithic electrode for electrocatalyst-based devices with exceptionally high multi-functional catalytic activity is presented. The optimized tri-functional activity is recorded at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with an overpotential at 36 mV for HER, and 229 mV for OER, indicating 1.51 V in an alkaline water electrolyzer, as well as a half-wave potential of 0.858 V for ORR. More importantly, the catalyst electrode exhibits an extremely low charge–discharge potential gap (ΔE less than 0.5 V) in solid-state rechargeable zinc-air batteries, attributed to its monolithic characteristics. Consequently, a self-powered hydrogen production system is driven by the identical pieces of the CoNC monoliths and zinc foil as a power source.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.128739
Atomic-Scale Engineered Fe Single-Atom Electrocatalyst Based on Waste Pig Blood for High-Performance AEMFCs,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Biomass is the ideal precursor for fabricating oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts due to its large-scale and low-cost production, as well as its renewability. Among various forms of biomass, especially waste pig blood is a sustainable precursor for the synthesis of functional electrocatalysts. However, various proteins or metal substances present in the waste pig blood act as impurities and impede the electrocatalytic performance, preventing its direct use as an electrocatalyst. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of hierarchical 2D porous Fe single-atom catalysts on a thermally exfoliated graphene oxide support using hemoglobin-rich red blood cells obtained from purified waste pig blood discarded during the slaughtering process. Because of the widespread Fe single-atom active sites formed via an effective and short heat treatment method and the outstanding mass-transfer properties of the hierarchical porous structure, pig blood-derived carbon (PBC/900/M) showed an excellent ORR performance in alkaline media. Moreover, PBC/900/M was successfully employed as a cathode material in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and showed a maximum power density of 658 mW/cm2, suggesting the remarkable potential for application in AEMFCs. This strategy provides a general approach to prepare a highly efficient single-atom-based catalyst with high performance using abundant biomass as a cost-effective electrocatalyst source.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c01590
A Highly Efficient Fe−N−C Electrocatalyst with Atomically Dispersed FeN4 Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHAtomically dispersed Fe−N−C electrocatalysts have displayed excellent catalytic performances towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the identification of the genuine active sites remains a challenge. Herein, we report a Fe−N−C electrocatalyst of FeSA/HNPC featuring single-atomic FeN4 sites on hierarchically N-doped porous carbon (HNPC), which shows a very competitive ORR activity in alkaline solution even at a low electrocatalyst loading of 0.2 mg cm−2 on the working electrode. A comparison of energy barriers in ORR reveals that the single-atomic FeN4 active sites in FeSA/HNPC existing in the form of pyrrole-N4−Fe is more favorable than that of pyridine-N4−Fe for the enhanced ORR activity. Understanding the nature of FeN4 active sites will greatly benefit the design of Fe−N−C electrocatalysts with highly effective ORR performances.",ChemCatChem,10.1002/cctc.202100132
Cobalt single atom catalysts for the efficient electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide,"© the Partner Organisations.We report the synthesis of cobalt (Co) single atoms (SAs) anchored on N-doped graphitic carbon (Co-SAs/NC) by the pyrolysis of a mixture of cobalt chloride hexahydrate, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). As an electrocatalyst, the Co-SAs/NC with a surface area of 165.6 m2 g-1 and a dominant mesoporous structure exhibited superior two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e- ORR) activity in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, affording a very positive onset potential of 0.84 V (vs. RHE) and a H2O2 selectivity of ∼76.0% at 0.5 V (vs. RHE). The long-term durability tests indicated that the Co-SAs/NC can generate 380.9 ± 14.85 μmol H2O2 stably after 10 h of reaction at 0.5 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH, showing only ∼10% decay of the current and the corresponding faradaic efficiency (FE) of ∼72.1 ± 4.2%. The superior 2e- ORR performance of Co-SAs/NC is ascribed to the synergetic effect of the Co-Nx active sites and nearby oxygen functional groups.

Engineering Pt and Fe dual-metal single atoms anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon with high activity and durability towards oxygen reduction reaction for zinc-air battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Fabrication of Pt-based electrocatalysts with high activity and excellent durability is critical for the practical applications into zinc-air battery (ZAB). In this work. A novel strategy for the encapsulation of Pt species into the cavities of Fe-doped zeolite imidazolate framework is proposed to increase the density of active metal atoms and improve the activity effectively, where both isolated Pt and Fe single atoms anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon (PtFeNC) are obtained by a simple pyrolysis. Impressively, PtFeNC delivers a half-wave potential of 0.895 V (vs. RHE), Moreover, PtFeNC exhibits a lower yield of peroxide species than FeNC. Importantly, the ZAB battery shows a specific capacity of as high as 807 mA h/g at a discharge current density of 10 mA/cm2. Our findings show that dual- and multi- metallic single atom catalysts with abundant active sites can be achieved to boost electrocatalytic activity for their practical applications in energy storage though the new tactic.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.119891
An oxygen-coordinated molybdenum single atom catalyst for efficient electrosynthesis of ammonia,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Electrochemical nitrogen (N2) reduction has been regarded as a promising strategy for artificial ammonia (NH3) production under ambient conditions. Herein, we report the fabrication of molybdenum (Mo) single atoms anchored on activated carbon (Mo-SAs/AC) for the electrochemical N2reduction to NH3. The surface-rich oxygen functional groups of activated carbon can effectively capture the Mo precursor, and concurrently act as the coordination sites to anchor Mo single atoms by forming Mo-Oxbonds. As a result, the Mo-SAs/AC as an electrocatalyst shows high activity toward the N2reduction reaction (NRR), affording an NH3yield rate of 2.55 ± 0.31 mg h−1mgMo−1and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 57.54 ± 6.98% at −0.40 V (vs.RHE) in 0.1 M Na2SO4electrolyte with good stability and durability. The constructed Mo-Oxsites are responsible for high NRR activity of Mo-SAs/AC.",Chemical Communications,10.1039/d1cc01455b
Tuning metal single atoms embedded in NxCy moieties toward high-performance electrocatalysis,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Noble nanoparticle (NP)-sized electrocatalysts have been exploited for diverse electrochemical reactions, in particular, for an eco-friendly hydrogen economy such as water splitting. Recently, minimal amounts of single atoms (SAs) are exploited to maximize the active surface area and to tune the catalytic activity by coordinating the SAs in defect sites of N-doped graphene (GN). For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR), we show high-performance 3d-5d transition metal (TM) SA catalysts using density functional theory (DFT) along with machine learning (ML)-based descriptors. We explore the stability and activity of TM-GNfrom the view of structure/coordination, formation energy, structural/electrochemical stability, electronic properties, electrical conductivity, and reaction mechanism, which have not been seriously explored yet. Among various -NnCmmoieties, the -N2C2moieties tend to be more easily formed and show higher electrochemical catalytic performance and longer durability (without aggregation/dissolution) compared with the widely studied pure -C4/C3and -N4/N3moieties. We found that some TM(SA)s favor a new OER/ORR mechanism, completely different from any known mechanism. The ML-based descriptors showing super HER/OER/ORR performances better than those of bench-mark noble metal catalysts are assessed. In the N2C2templates, Ni/Ru/Rh/Pt show low HER overpotentials. Here, the H adsorption sites are shared by both the metal and C (not N), which was undiscussed in most of the previous literature where the H is attached on top of a metal atom. Low OER overpotentials are found for Pt/Ni-N2C2, Ni/Pd-C4, and Rh-N4, while low ORR overpotentials are found for Ir/Rh-N4, Pd-C4, Ru-N3C1and Ni/Pd/Pt-N1C3. The present findings should help in designing high-performance SA catalysts for other various electrocatalytic reactions such as the ammonia evolution reaction.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/d1ee00154j

Vertical-orbital band center as an activity descriptor for hydrogen evolution reaction on single-atom-anchored 2D catalysts,"© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.The d-band center descriptor based on the adsorption strength of adsorbate has been widely used in understanding and predicting the catalytic activity in various metal catalysts. However, its applicability is unsure for the single-atom-anchored two-dimensional (2D) catalysts. Here, taking the hydrogen (H) adsorption on the single-atom-anchored 2D basal plane as example, we examine the influence of orbitals interaction on the bond strength of hydrogen adsorption. We find that the adsorption of H is formed mainly via the hybridization between the 1s orbital of H and the vertical dz2 orbital of anchored atoms. The other four projected d orbitals (dxy/dx2-y2, dxz/dyz) have no contribution to the H chemical bond. There is an explicit linear relation between the dz2-band center and the H bond strength. The dz2-band center is proposed as an activity descriptor for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We demonstrate that the dz2-band center is valid for the single-atom active sites on a single facet, such as the basal plane of 2D nanosheets. For the surface with multiple facets, such as the surface of three-dimensional (3D) polyhedral nanoparticles, the d-band center is more suitable.",Journal of Physics Condensed Matter,10.1088/1361-648X/abe9da
Pt/Fe2O3 with Pt–Fe pair sites as a catalyst for oxygen reduction with ultralow Pt loading,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.Platinum is the archetypal electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction—a key reaction in fuel cells and zinc–air batteries. Although dispersing platinum as single atoms on a support is a promising way to minimize the amount required, catalytic activity and selectivity are often low due to unfavourable O2 adsorption. Here we load platinum onto α-Fe2O3 to construct a highly active and stable catalyst with dispersed Pt–Fe pair sites. We propose that the Pt–Fe pair sites have partially occupied orbitals driven by strong electronic coupling, and can cooperatively adsorb O2 and dissociate the O=O bond, whereas OH* can desorb from the platinum site. In alkaline conditions, the catalyst exhibits onset and half-wave potentials of 1.15 V and 1.05 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively, mass activity of 14.9 A mg−1Pt (at 0.95 V) and negligible activity decay after 50,000 cycles. It also shows better performance than 20% Pt/C in a zinc–air battery and H2–O2 fuel cell in terms of specific energy density and platinum utilization efficiency.",Nature Energy,10.1038/s41560-021-00826-5
Atomically Dispersed Platinum Modulated by Sulfide as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHCatalytically active metals atomically dispersed on supports presents the ultimate atom utilization efficiency and cost-effective pathway for electrocatalyst design. Optimizing the coordination nature of metal atoms represents the advanced strategy for enhancing the catalytic activity and the selectivity of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Here, we designed a transition-metal based sulfide-Ni3S2 with abundant exposed Ni vacancies created by the interaction between chloride ions and the functional groups on the surface of Ni3S2 for the anchoring of atomically dispersed Pt (PtSA-Ni3S2). The theoretical calculation reveals that unique Pt-Ni3S2 support interaction increases the d orbital electron occupation at the Fermi level and leads to a shift-down of the d -band center, which energetically enhances H2O adsorption and provides the optimum H binding sites. Introducing Pt into Ni position in Ni3S2 system can efficiently enhance electronic field distribution and construct a metallic-state feature on the Pt sites by the orbital hybridization between S-3p and Pt-5d for improved reaction kinetics. Finally, the fabricated PtSA-Ni3S2 SAC is supported by Ag nanowires network to construct a seamless conductive three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure (PtSA-Ni3S2@Ag NWs), and the developed catalyst shows an extremely great mass activity of 7.6 A mg−1 with 27-time higher than the commercial Pt/C HER catalyst.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.202100347
Highly Scalable Conversion of Blood Protoporphyrin to Efficient Electrocatalyst for CO2-to-CO Conversion,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHElectrochemical CO2 reduction to valuable chemicals represents a green and sustainable approach to close the anthropogenic carbon cycle, but has been impeded by low efficiency and high cost of electrocatalysts. Here, a cost-effective hybrid catalyst consisting of hemin (chloroprotoporphyrin IX iron(III)), a product recovered from bovine blood, adsorbed onto commercial Vulcan carbon is reported. Upon heat treatment, this material shows significantly improved activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction in water while exhibiting good stability for more than 10 h. The heat treatment leads to consecutive removal of the axial chlorine atom and decomposition of the iron porphyrin ring, restructuring to form atomic Fe sites. The optimized hybrid catalyst obtained at 900 °C shows near-unity selectivity for reduction of CO2 to CO at a small overpotential of 310 mV. The insight into transformation of adsorbed Fe complexes into single Fe atoms upon heat treatment provides guidance for development of single atom catalysts.",Advanced Materials Interfaces,10.1002/admi.202100067
Carbon-Coordinated Single Cr Site for Efficient Electrocatalytic N2 Fixation,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHElectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a very promising method for ammonia (NH3) synthesis under ambient conditions, which can provide alternative routes to the traditional Haber–Bosch process and realize green NH3 synthesis. In this study, the electrocatalytic performance of chromium (Cr) atom anchored to graphyne (Cr@GY) is systematically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results show that Cr@GY is an efficient NRR electrocatalyst which can activate the inert N≡N bond sufficiently. In particular, the enzymatic mechanism is considered as the most positive catalytic pathway with the limiting potential of −0.52 V. More importantly, Cr@GY can restrict a competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The electronic properties including Bader charge, the charge difference density (CDD), the partial density of states (PDOS) and the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) have been analyzed in detail. In addition, the co-doping of B and N atoms in GY is beneficial to reduce the energy barrier of the potential-determining step (PDS) and promote the smooth progress of the NRR.

Single-Atom Co-Decorated MoS2 Nanosheets Assembled on Metal Nitride Nanorod Arrays as an Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for pH-Universal Water Splitting,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe commercialization of electrochemical water splitting technology requires electrocatalysts that are cost-effective, highly efficient, and stable. Herein, an advanced bifunctional electrocatalyst based on single-atom Co-decorated MoS2 nanosheets grown on 3D titanium nitride (TiN) nanorod arrays (CoSAs-MoS2/TiN NRs) has been developed for overall water splitting in pH-universal electrolytes. When applied as a self-standing cathodic electrode, the CoSAs-MoS2/TiN NRs requires overpotentials of 187.5, 131.9, and 203.4 mV to reach a HER current density of 10 mA cm–2 in acidic, alkaline, and neutral conditions, respectively, which are superior to the most previously reported non-noble metal HER electrocatalysts at the same current density. The CoSAs-MoS2/TiN NRs anodic electrode also shows low OER overpotentials of 454.9, 340.6, and 508.0 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 in acidic, alkaline, and neutral mediums, markedly outperforming current OER catalysts reported elsewhere. More importantly, an electrolyzer delivered from the cathodic and anodic CoSAs-MoS2/TiN NRs electrodes exhibits an extraordinary overall water splitting performance with good stability and durability in pH-universal conditions.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202100233
Single Platinum Atoms Immobilized on Monolayer Tungsten Trioxide Nanosheets as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHMonolayer WO3·H2O (ML-WO3·H2O) nanosheets are synthesized via a space-confined strategy, and then a single-atom catalyst (SAC) is constructed by individually immobilizing Pt single atoms (Pt-SA) on monolayer WO3 (ML-WO3). The Pt-SA/ML-WO3 retains the monolayer structure of ML-WO3·H2O, with a quite high monolayer ratio up to ≈93%, and possesses rich defects (O and W vacancies). It exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance, with a small overpotential (η) of −22 mV to drive −10 mA cm−2 current, a low Tafel slope of ≈27 mV dec−1, an ultrahigh turnover frequency of ≈87 H2 s−1 site−1 at η = −50 mV, and long-term stability. Of particular note, it exhibits an ultrahigh mass activity of ≈87 A mgPt−1 at η = −50 mV, which is ≈160 times greater than that of the state-of-the-art commercial catalyst, 20 wt% Pt/C (≈0.54 A mgPt−1). Experimental and DFT analyses reveal that its excellent performance arises from the strong synergetic effect between the single Pt atoms and the support. This work provides an effective route for large-scale fabrication of ML-WO3 nanosheets, demonstrates ML-WO3 is an excellent support for SACs, and also reveals the great potential of SACs in reducing the amount of noble metals used in catalysts.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202009770
Theoretical scanning of bimetallic alloy for designing efficient N2 electroreduction catalyst,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdNitrogen reduction conversion into ammonia has received considerable attention and shown application potential in materials science. This work presents the results of theoretical scanning based on comprehensive first principle calculations of bimetallic alloys with the general formula MN, where M and N are transition metals that can be used as electrocatalysts for high-performance N2 reduction. To date, no detailed reaction mechanism has been verified for the production rates in commercial applications. This work of calculations reveals that N2 can be reduced to ammonia (NH3) on palladium-gold (PdAu) and copper-tin (CuSn) bimetallic alloy catalysts with a relatively low limiting potential and activation barrier compared with other bimetallic alloy catalysts. The nitrogen reduction reaction is highly selective and active compared to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work provides promising guidance for designing efficient single-atom catalysts for the electroreduction of N2. Nickel-cerium (NiCe) bimetallic alloy catalyst was found to have a low activation energy of 0.49 eV during the third hydrogenation step. Scaling relationships were found to exist between the binding energy and limiting potential of NxHy intermediate species in each elementary step on the bimetallic alloy surfaces. This work also provides a promising way to explore and design efficient N2 reduction reaction (NRR) catalysts and identify the reaction mechanism for improving and controlling catalytic performance in practical applications.",Materials Today Energy,10.1016/j.mtener.2021.100684
Efficient electroreduction of CO2 by single-atom catalysts two-dimensional metal hexahydroxybenzene frameworks: A theoretical study,"© 2021Electrochemical CO2 reduction provides a feasible technology for alleviating the energy crisis and global warming, as well as sustainable production of fuels. However, a tremendous challenge is to explore the highly efficient catalysts. Herein, on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the catalytic performance of a series of M3(hexahydroxybenzene)2 (M3(HHB)2) complex nanosheets as the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalysts was systemically evaluated. The results demonstrated that the catalytic activity of M3(HHB)2 depends on the intensity of interaction between CO2RR intermediates and metal atoms, and can be adjusted by changing the metal atoms. Among the studied candidates, M3(HHB)2 (M = Cr, Mo, Ru, and Rh) are predicted to be potential electrocatalysts toward the CO2RR due to low limiting potential of −0.49, −0.67, −0.63, and −0.68 V, respectively, which are comparable to that of other reported CO2RR catalysts. In particular, CH4 is the favorable product on M3(HHB)2 (M = Cr and Mo) via *HCOO pathway, while the main product of M3(HHB)2 (M = Ru and Rh) is CH3OH via *COOH channel. It is expected that our investigations could provide meaningful guidance for developing CO2RR electrocatalysts.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.149389
On scaling relations of single atom catalysts for electrochemical ammonia synthesis,"© 2021In this study, we performed the first-principles density functional theory calculations to systematically predict the activity of fifty-eight types of different single atom electrocatalysts on nitrogen doped graphene for electrochemical ammonia synthesis. Two strong linear relations were revealed among the reaction energies on these single atom structures, including positive correlation between the adsorption energy of N2H and the free energy change for *N2 transition to *N2H, as well as negative correlation between the adsorption energy of NH2 and the free energy change for *NH2 transition to *NH3. Using the developed scaling relations and some additional factors including nitrogen adsorption, hydrogen evolution reaction, water adsorption, ammonia desorption and structure stability, we have computationally identified six candidate structures as promising active sites for ammonia synthesis. Especially, V-N4/graphene was predicted to exhibit the best stability, the highest activity with the limiting potential of −0.71 V, and suppression of hydrogen evolution reaction.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.149283
Anchoring Mo on C9N4 monolayers as an efficient single atom catalyst for nitrogen fixation,"© 2020Electrochemical nitrogen fixation via a convenient and sustainable manner, exhibits an intriguing prospect for ammonia generation under ambient conditions. Currently, the design and development of high-efficiency and low-cost electrocatalysts remains the major challenge confronting nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Herein, anchoring the single Mo atom on the C9N4 substrate (Mo@C9N4) to form an efficient single-atom catalyst (SAC) is proposed for the conversion of N2 to NH3. By employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrated that gas phase N2 can be sufficiently activated and efficiently reduced to NH3 on the surface of Mo@C9N4. Meanwhile, we found that the NRR dominantly occurred on the Mo center via a preferred distal pathway with favorable limiting potential of 0.40 V. Importantly, the as-established Mo@C9N4 catalyst exhibits an outstanding structural stability and good selectivity toward NRR. These findings provide a promising platform for designing Mo-based SACs for electrochemical N2 fixation.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2020.09.002
Single-atom Pt promoted Mo2C for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2020 Science PressHydrogen generation from electrochemical water splitting powered by renewable energy is important to the sustainable society, but the prohibitive cost of current Pt electrocatalyst has impeded the large-scale production of hydrogen by water electrolysis. In this contribution, a new low-Pt electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been fabricated by a facile one-pot synthesis approach, in which Pt2+ cations and phosphomolybdic acid confined in the metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) were submitted to pyrolysis to yield Pt single atoms dispersed into Mo2C nanocrystals in 3D porous carbon matrix. The as-synthesized Pt1-Mo2C-C catalyst with Pt content of only 0.7 wt% exhibited remarkably enhanced activity for HER in 1 M KOH, with overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 lowered from 211 mV to 155 mV and 7-fold higher mass activity (7.14 A/mgPt) than the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C. The promoted activity can be attributed to the electronic interaction between Pt single atoms and Mo2C surface, which not only improved water activation but also strengthened hydrogen adsorption, as indicated by FTIR and microcalorimetric characterizations.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.028
Ru single atoms and nanoclusters on highly porous N-doped carbon as a hydrogen evolution catalyst in alkaline solutions with ultrahigh mass activity and turnover frequency,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the most desirable ways to produce hydrogen, which is a clean and sustainable energy source. Improving the formation and the exposure of active sites is a key issue in the design of cost-effective and efficient metal-based electrocatalysts, especially for noble metals, in order to cut down the metal content and improve the mass activity of the metals, while maintaining high catalytic activity. Herein, we report a high-performance Ru-based electrocatalyst consisting of Ru single atoms and Ru nanoclusters encapsulated in highly porous N-doped carbon with abundant hierarchical pores (Ru/p-NC). Remarkably, Ru/p-NC shows excellent HER activity in 1.0 M KOH with a low overpotential of 10 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 17 mV dec-1 as well as good durability for 24 h, outperforming commercial Pt/C and Ru/C catalysts. More importantly, the mass activity and turnover frequency (based on Ru loading) of Ru/p-NC are ultrahigh owing to the low loading of Ru, which are 17 A mgRu-1 and 8.9 H2 s-1, respectively, at a very low overpotential of 25 mV. Experimental results indicate that the porous N-doped carbon support not only leads to exposed active sites but also interacts strongly with the Ru moieties. In addition, it tunes the electronic structure of the catalyst, boosts the stability as well as facilitates mass transport and charge transfer kinetics.

Rational Design of Electrocatalysts Comprising Single-Atom-Modified Covalent Organic Frameworks for the N2Reduction Reaction: A First-Principles Study,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.The electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is one of the most promising methods for the on-site and on-demand production of NH3. Single-metal-atom-doped covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are expected to function as efficient NRR electrocatalysts because a designed coordination environment of metal centers is available as a consequence of the wide range of possible designs of COFs. Herein, we used density functional theory (DFT) to systematically investigate the theoretical NRR activity of various single-3d-metal atoms doped into COFs with different coordination numbers to attain a general design guideline for the development of efficient NRR catalysts. The adsorption strength of NRR intermediates decreased as either the coordination number or the number of d-electrons of the metal centers increased. The potential-determining step switched between N-N bond activation and NH3 desorption depending on the adsorption strength of the NRR intermediates. Therefore, an optimal NRR catalyst exhibits a moderate binding strength with intermediates. Among the investigated metal-doped COFs, an Fe metal center with a coordination number of three exhibited the highest theoretical onset potential (-0.49 eV vs the computational hydrogen electrode). In this catalyst, the charge-density and density-of-state analyses revealed moderate πback-donation and σ donation between Fe 3d orbitals and the π∗ orbital of N-N bonds, which resulted in the optimal binding strength of intermediates.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c02832
Highly Dispersive Cerium Atoms on Carbon Nanowires as Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysts for Zn-Air Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Highly efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are essential to reduce the costs of fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Herein, a single-atom Ce-N-C catalyst, constructed of atomically dispersed Ce anchored on N-doped porous carbon nanowires, is proposed to boost the ORR. This catalyst has a high Ce content of 8.55 wt % and a high activity with ORR half-wave potentials of 0.88 V in alkaline media and 0.75 V in acidic electrolytes, which are comparable to widely studied Fe-N-C catalysts. A Zn-air battery based on this material shows excellent performance and durability. Density functional theory calculations reveal that atomically dispersed Ce with adsorbed hydroxyl species (OH) can significantly reduce the energy barrier of the rate-determining step resulting in an improved ORR activity.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c01493
Boosting CO2electroreduction to CO with abundant nickel single atom active sites,"© the Partner Organisations.The conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals through the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is considered as an up-and-coming way to facilitate the renewable closed carbon cycle and energy storage. Therefore, the development of robust and low-cost CO2RR electrocatalysts is essential but challenging. Herein, a Ni single-atom catalyst (Ni-SAs-NC) was successfully prepared via a precursor assembly strategy and a subsequent one-step pyrolysis process. Characterization studies demonstrate that abundant Ni single-atom active sites with the coordination structure of Ni-N4 are uniformly dispersed in Ni-SAs-NC, which consequently endow it with outstanding electrocatalytic CO2RR performance. Strikingly, the as-prepared Ni-SAs-NC can selectively convert CO2 into CO with a high faradaic efficiency of up to 98%, and can maintain the high values exceeding 90% in a wide potential range from -0.6 to -1.0 V. This work provides a new protocol to prepare high-efficiency but low-cost single-atom electrocatalysts toward the CO2RR and other electrochemical reactions.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers,10.1039/d1qi00126d
Machine learning-accelerated prediction of overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction of single-atom catalysts,"© 2021 The Author(s)The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical reaction for energy-related applications, yet suffers from its slow kinetics and large overpotential. It is desirable to develop effective OER electrocatalysts, such as single-atom catalysts (SACs). Here, we demonstrate machine learning (ML)-accelerated prediction of OER overpotential of all transition metals. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of 15 species of SACs, we design a topological information-based ML model to map the OER overpotentials with atomic properties of the corresponding SACs. The trained ML model not only yields remarkable prediction precision (relative error of 6.49%) but also enables a 130,000-fold reduction of prediction time in comparison with pure DFT calculation. Furthermore, an intrinsic descriptor that correlates the overpotential of an SAC with its atomic properties is revealed. The approach and results from this study can be readily applicable to screen other SACs and significantly accelerate the design of high-performance catalysts for many other reactions.",iScience,10.1016/j.isci.2021.102398
Hydrogen evolution reaction on in-plane platinum and palladium dichalcogenides via single-atom doping,"© 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCSearching for the catalysts with excellent catalytic activity and high chemical stability is the key to achieve large-scale production of hydrogen (H2) through hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Two-dimensional (2D) platinum and palladium dichalcogenides with extraordinary electrical properties have emerged as the potential candidate for HER catalysts. Here, chemical stability, HER electrocatalytic activity, and the origin of improved HER performance of Pt/Pd-based dichalcogenides with single-atom doping (B, C, N, P, Au, Ag, Cu, Co, Fe, Ni, Zn) and vacancies are explored by first-principles calculations. The calculated defect formation energy reveals that most defective structures are thermodynamically stable. Hydrogen evolution performance on basal plane is obviously improved by single-atoms doping and vacancies. Particularly, Zn-doped and Te vacancy PtTe2 have a ΔGH value close to zero. Moreover, defect engineering displays a different performance on HER catalytic activity in sulfur group elements, in order of S < Te < Se in Pd-based chalcogenides, and S < Se < Te in Pt-based chalcogenides. The origin of improved hydrogen evolution performance is revealed by electronic structure and charge transfer. Our findings of the highly activating defective systems provide a theoretical basis for HER applications of platinum and palladium dichalcogenides.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.206
Single Co Atoms Implanted into N-Doped Hollow Carbon Nanoshells with Non-Planar Co-N4-1-O2Sites for Efficient Oxygen Electrochemistry,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Facile synthesis of cost-effective carbon-supported Co single atoms (Co-SAs) exhibits huge potential applications in energy storage and conversion devices. We here report the implantation of Co-SAs into hollow carbon spheres (Co-SAs-HCS) via a facile wet-chemistry strategy followed by controlled pyrolysis. Electron-rich histidine acted as a Lewis base effectively immobilizing Co2+ (Lewis acid) via the electrostatic effect and hydrogen bonds, thus achieving the scalable synthesis of Co-SAs-HCS. We constructed a series of histidine-Co2+ structure models to elucidate the formation of histidine-Co2+ complexes by analyzing their binding energy. X-ray absorption fine-structure results verify that central Co atoms with four N coordination atoms possess a non-planar Co-N4 structure. Electrochemical results indicate that the as-prepared Co-SAs-HCS catalyst shows a low potential difference (0.809 V) between the oxygen evolution reaction potential at 10 mA cm-2 and the oxygen reduction reaction half-wave potential, outperforming the commercial Pt/C catalysts (0.996 V). Moreover, an assembled Zn-air battery based on Co-SAs-HCS exhibits an unexpected long-term durability. We have demonstrated that non-planar Co-N4-1-O2 sites are the source for highly efficient adsorption and dissociation of O2 molecules and then reduction of the free energy of desorption of the intermediates by density functional theory. Our findings provide a new design insight into the exploration of advanced electrocatalysts, which will be applied in the design of green energy devices in the future.",Inorganic Chemistry,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c00824
Proton Capture Strategy for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Atomically Dispersed Metal–Nitrogen Active Sites**,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHElectrocatalysts play a key role in accelerating the sluggish electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) involving multi-electron and proton transfer. We now develop a proton capture strategy by accelerating the water dissociation reaction catalyzed by transition-metal nanoparticles (NPs) adjacent to atomically dispersed and nitrogen-coordinated single nickel (Ni−Nx) active sites to accelerate proton transfer to the latter for boosting the intermediate protonation step, and thus the whole ECR process. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and calculations reveal that the Ni NPs accelerate the adsorbed H (Had) generation and transfer to the adjacent Ni−Nx sites for boosting the intermediate protonation and the overall ECR processes. This proton capture strategy is universal to design and prepare for various high-performance catalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions even beyond ECR.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202100011
Theoretical screening of VSe2 as support for enhanced electrocatalytic performance of transition-metal single atoms,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted enormous attentions in heterogeneous catalysts due to the maximized atomic utilization and extraordinary catalytic performance. Similar to homogeneous catalytic ligands, the support in SACs plays a vital role in the catalytic properties. Herein, we present a series of transition-metal atoms (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt) anchored on a vanadium diselenide (VSe2) monolayer as electrocatalysts through density functional theory calculations. Pd@VSe2 stands out among the considered SACs with a low overpotential of 0.38 V, exhibiting the excellent performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Meanwhile, a liner trend between the adsorption Gibbs free energy of the OH (ΔGOH*) and the predicted ηORR is revealed, which may serve as a simple descriptor for the inherent ORR catalytic activity of SACs. Particularly, Pt@VSe2 shows extraordinarily low theoretical overpotential of −0.04/0.47 V for hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction, which transcends the state-of-the-art Pt and IrO2 and thereby can be exploited as highly-efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. This work broadens the perception of designing multifunctional electrocatalysts based on two-dimensional VSe2 material and offers a new paradigm for investigating advanced SACs.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2021.01.062
Template-free synthesis of non-noble metal single-atom electrocatalyst with N-doped holey carbon matrix for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction in zinc-air batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.M-N-C single-atom electrocatalysts recently have received significant attention because of high catalytic activity and maximal atom utilization. Here, it is firstly reported that macrocycle cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) self-assembly was employed as precursor to fabricate M-N-C single-atom electrocatalysts for the Zn-air battery (ZAB). This template-free method using CB[6] self-assembly acquires the holey N-doped matrixes with hierarchical micro/mesoporous structure. The Fe loaded N-doped holey carbon single-atom electrocatalyst (Fe-NHC) exhibited high activity with the half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.89 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline condition, which was better than those of Co or Ni loaded catalyst and commercial Pt/C (E1/2 = 0.83 V). Moreover, the ZAB employing Fe-NHC catalyst achieved higher power and energy density with longer-term stability than those of Pt/C + Ir/C catalyst. This work provided a promising strategy to design stable and highly efficient catalyst for long-life electrochemical storage devices.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119780
Activating transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reactionviasingle atom doping,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Recent studies on 2D transition-metal-dichalcogenides (TMDs) for electrocatalytic applications have mainly concentrated on MoS2, while the catalytic properties of the majority of other TMDs remain undiscovered. This work reveals the activity of sulfur-based IVB-BVII TMDs in different phase structures for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The pristine TMDs are inactive for the ORR. Adatom doping with transition metals and non-metal substitutional doping are efficient strategies to modify TMDs. Particularly, Ni or Co doped 1T-TiS2, 2H-TiS2, 1T-ZrS2, 1T-TaS2, 1T-NbS2and 2H-TaS2act as feasible ORR electrocatalysts with overpotential (0.32-0.55 V) comparable to that of state-of-the-art Pt-based electrocatalysts. However, 2H-WS2, 2H-TaS2, 2H-TiS2and 1T′-WS2can be effectively activated by N doping with an overpotential of 0.3-0.75 V. Our predictions show an effective way to modify the ORR activity of TMDs by single atom doping, which would be helpful to provoke future experimental interest of the ORR in these systems.",Journal of Materials Chemistry C,10.1039/d1tc00668a
Density functional theory study of transition metal single-atoms anchored on graphyne as efficient electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2021 the Owner Societies.Ammonia (NH3) is the main raw material for the organic chemical industry and a critical feedstock for the fertilizer industry with great significance for the global economy. The NH3 demand has gradually increased with modern society development. Moreover, the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising NH3 synthesis technology. However, the design of efficient electrocatalysts for the NRR is still challenging. In this study, we systematically analyzed transition metal (TM) single-atoms (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Zr, Nb, and Mo) anchored on graphyne (GY) as NRR catalysts using density functional theory calculations. The calculation results for the first and last hydrogenation steps (∗NNH formation and ∗NH3 desorption, respectively) revealed that Mn@GY (with an end-on configuration) and V@GY (with a side-on configuration) were the most suitable catalytic substrates for the NRR. The free-energy profiles of the TM@GY catalysts indicated that Mn@GY was the best NRR electrocatalyst owing to its distal pathway with a minimum free-energy barrier of 0.36 eV. In addition, the electronic properties, namely the Bader charge, charge density difference, partial density of states, and crystal orbital Hamilton population, of the TM@GY catalysts were analyzed in detail, and the results further confirmed that Mn@GY was an efficient electrocatalyst. The insights obtained from this comprehensive study can provide useful guidelines for designing new and efficient electrocatalysts.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d1cp00690h
Single atom catalysts for boosting electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic performances,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Electrocatalytic (EC) and photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting are effective processes for mass production of hydrogen; however, they usually endure large overpotentials or low conversion efficiency. Therefore, the exploration of efficient and scale-up feasible electrocatalysts and cocatalysts is highly desirable. The novel and emerging single Pt atom catalyst is promising to perfectly satisfy the strict requirements of the EC and PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a partial nitridation modification strategy is proposed to anchor single platinum (Pt) atoms through the coordination of lone pair electrons of nitrogen atoms with the unoccupied d orbital electrons of Pt atoms. The fixed single Pt atoms are located on a porous nickel framework on nickel foam (Pt1/N-Ni/NF), and show excellent EC activity with a low overpotential of 33 mV at -10 mA cm-2 for the HER in neutral solution, which is superior to that of the bench-mark commercial electrocatalyst. In addition, the Pt1/N-Ni has been integrated into a Cu2O nanowire photocathode as a cocatalyst, and presents a high photocurrent density of -11.9 mA cm-2 at 0 V vs. RHE and PEC conversion efficiency of 1.75%. The rational design and preparation of a single atom catalyst both as an electrocatalyst for EC and a cocatalyst for PEC water splitting opens up a new avenue for boosting EC and PEC water splitting performance.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta01845k
Framework-derived tungsten single-atom catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyFor many types of fuel cells (FCs), the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the bottleneck reaction. At present, a major challenge to the industrialization of these devices is attributed to the high price and inferior stability of the common platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts. To address this issue, a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) derived tungsten (W) single-atom electrocatalyst has been synthesized and evaluated for the ORR. It was found that the prepared catalyst (W−N−C) possesses a W single-atom catalysis center coordinated in a nitrogen-rich carbon matrix with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.86 V and a negligible current decay over a long-term durability test, which surpass those of many reported nonprecious metals and even commercial Pt/C catalysts.",Energy and Fuels,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00758
Atomically Dispersed Copper on N-Doped Carbon Nanosheets for Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Carbamates from CO2 as a C1 Source,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe synthesis of carbamates by electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 is an effective method to realize the utilization of CO2 resources. The development of high-performance electrocatalysts to complete this process more efficiently is of great significance to sustainable development. Owing to their unique structural characteristics, single-atom catalysts are expected to promote the reaction process more efficiently. In this study, an atomically dispersed Cu species on N-doped carbon nanosheet composite material (Cu−N−C) was prepared by metal-organic framework derivatization. Compared with traditional Cu bulk electrodes, the Cu−N−C material has better catalytic performance for the synthesis of methyl N-phenylcarbamate; and the optimized yield reached 71 % at room temperature and normal pressure. The Cu−N−C material has good stability that the catalytic performance does not decrease after repeated use for 10 times.

First demonstration of phosphate enhanced atomically dispersed bimetallic FeCu catalysts as Pt-free cathodes for high temperature phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole fuel cells,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Phosphate poisoning of Pt electrocatalysts is one of the major barriers that constrains the performance of phosphoric acid-doped polybenzimidazole (PA/PBI) membrane fuel cells. Herein, we developed new atomically dispersed bimetallic FeCu coordinated with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (FeCu/N-CNTs) as Pt-free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. The cell with FeCu/N-CNTs cathodes delivers a peak power density of 302 mWcm−2 at 230℃, similar to that using Pt/C electrocatalysts (1 mgPt cm−2) but with a much better stability. In contrast to phosphate poisoning of Pt/C, FeCu/N-CNTs show PA enhanced activities. DFT calcualtions indicate that phosphate promotion effect results from the stronger binding of phosphate on Cu sites, which decreases the activation energy barrier for the cleavage of the O2 double bond and provides local protons to facilitate the proton-coupled electron transfer ORR. The results also show that FeCu/N-CNTs have a much better activity for ORR as comapre to Fe single atom catalysts coordinated with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes, Fe/N-CNTs. This study demonstrates the promising potential of bimetallic FeCu/N-CNTs as true Pt-free, highly active and durable cathodes for PA/PBI based high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119717
Pt Single Atoms Supported on N-Doped Mesoporous Hollow Carbon Spheres with Enhanced Electrocatalytic H2-Evolution Activity,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe electronic metal–support interaction (EMSI) plays a crucial role in catalysis as it can induce electron transfer between metal and support, modulate the electronic state of the supported metal, and optimize the reduction of intermediate species. In this work, the tailoring of electronic structure of Pt single atoms supported on N-doped mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (Pt1/NMHCS) via strong EMSI engineering is reported. The Pt1/NMHCS composite is much more active and stable than the nanoparticle (PtNP) counterpart and commercial 20 wt% Pt/C for catalyzing the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), exhibiting a low overpotential of 40 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, a high mass activity of 2.07 A mg−1Pt at 50 mV overpotential, a large turnover frequency of 20.18 s−1 at 300 mV overpotential, and outstanding durability in acidic electrolyte. Detailed spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the strong EMSI effect in a unique N1−Pt1−C2 coordination structure significantly tailors the electronic structure of Pt 5d states, resulting in promoted reduction of adsorbed proton, facilitated H−H coupling, and thus Pt-like HER activity. This work provides a constructive route for precisely designing single-Pt-atom-based robust electrocatalysts with high HER activity and durability.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202008599
Molten NaCl-Assisted Synthesis of Porous Fe-N-C Electrocatalysts with a High Density of Catalytically Accessible FeN4 Active Sites and Outstanding Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHIron single atom catalysts (FeN4) hosted in the micropores of N-doped carbons offer excellent performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Achieving a high density of FeN4 sites accessible for ORR has proved challenging to date. Herein, a simple surface NaCl-assisted method towards microporous N-doped carbon electrocatalysts with an abundance of catalytically accessible FeN4 sites is reported. Powder mixtures of microporous zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 and NaCl are first heated to 1000 °C in N2, with the melting of NaCl above 800 °C creating a highly porous N-doped carbon product (NC-NaCl). Ferric (Fe3+) ions are then adsorbed onto NC-NaCl, with a second pyrolysis stage at 900 °C in N2 yielding a porous Fe/NC-NaCl electrocatalyst (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, 1911 m2 g−1) with an excellent dispersion and high density of accessible surface FeN4 sites (26.3 × 1019 sites g−1). The Fe/NC-NaCl electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding ORR performance with a high half-wave potential of 0.832 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.1 m HClO4. When used as the ORR cathode catalyst in a 1.0 bar H2-O2 fuel cell, Fe/NC-NaCl offers a high peak power density of 0.89 W cm−2, ranking it as one of the most active M-N-C materials reported to date.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202100219
Black phosphorus-hosted single-atom catalyst for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction 黑磷负载的单原子催化剂用于电催化N2还原,"© 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Designing highly selective and efficient single-atom electrocatalysts is essential for ammonia production under ambient conditions. This paper describes a density functional theory study on exploring the performance trends of transition metal complexes with P-based ligands in nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and further develops a design principle for high-performance single-atom catalysts (SACs) of NRR. Among the explored catalysts, W@BP (0.40 eV), Ta@BP (0.47 eV), and Nb@BP (0.53 eV) are identified as remarkable candidates with low free energy change in the potential-limiting step, high stability and high electrical conductivity for NRR. It is worth noting that almost all SACs with P-based ligands exhibit high NRR selectivity, due to the fact that they adsorb *N2 more strongly than *H. The adsorption free energy of *N2H can be considered as a descriptor for the intrinsic activity trends in NRR. Furthermore, by constructing a volcano plot of the activity against the electronic charge on metal centers, it is demonstrated that the metal center with a moderate amount of positive charge can promote the catalytic performance of NRR.",Science China Materials,10.1007/s40843-020-1522-y
Harnessing the Extracellular Electron Transfer Capability of Geobacter sulfurreducens for Ambient Synthesis of Stable Bifunctional Single-Atom Electrocatalyst for Water Splitting,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle-atom metal (SA-M) catalysts with high dispersion of active metal sites allow maximum atomic utilization. Conventional synthesis of SA-M catalysts involves high-temperature treatments, leading to low yield with a random distribution of atoms. Herein, a nature-based facile method to synthesize SA-M catalysts (M = Fe, Ir, Pt, Ru, Cu, or Pd) in a single step at ambient temperature, using the extracellular electron transfer capability of Geobacter sulfurreducens (GS), is presented. Interestingly, the SA-M is coordinated to three nitrogen atoms adopting an MN3 on the surface of GS. Dry samples of SA-Ir@GS without further heat treatment show exceptionally high activity for oxygen evolution reaction when compared to benchmark IrO2 catalyst and comparable hydrogen evolution reaction activity to commercial 10 wt% Pt/C. The SA-Ir@GS exhibits the best water-splitting performance compared to other SA-M@GS, showing a low applied potential of 1.65 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with cycling over 5 h. The density functional calculations reveal that the large adsorption energy of H2O and moderate adsorption energies of reactants and reaction intermediates for SA-Ir@GS favorably improve its activity. This synthesis method at room temperature provides a versatile platform for the preparation of SA-M catalysts for various applications by merely altering the metal precursors.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202010916
Dual Evolution in Defect and Morphology of Single-Atom Dispersed Carbon Based Oxygen Electrocatalyst,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe structure design and atomic modulation of catalysts are two sides of the same coin, both of which are deemed critical factors to regulate the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. Herein, cobalt single-atom anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene-sheet@tube (CoSAs-NGST) is derived from a novel Co, Zn-coordinated zeolitic imidazolate framework (CoZn-ZIF) in the presence of dicyandiamide. CoSAs-NGST exhibited a hybrid structure with a bamboo-like graphene tube and sheet. The atomic configuration of intrinsic defects is characterized by electron energy loss spectroscopy. The morphology differentiation from cake-shape structure to low-dimension hybrid not only enhances the dispersity of single atoms but also induces defect state evolution, which results in the formation of a CoN4-rich graphene tube. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling revealed that the coupling effect on oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) pathways of Co-N4-tube and Co-N4-sheet is responsible for the enhanced activity of CoSAs-NGST. In addition to the superb ORR/OER bifunctional catalytic performance, CoSAs-NGST also demonstrates a notably small charge–discharge voltage drop of 0.93 V when applied in the rechargeable zinc–air battery outperforming Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst. The present study provides an insight into the relationship between the structure design and atomic modulation of the carbon based catalysts.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202010472
Identifying the Activity Origin of a Cobalt Single-Atom Catalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Using Supervised Learning,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have become the forefront of energy conversion studies, but unfortunately, the origin of their activity and the interpretation of the synchrotron spectrograms of these materials remain ambiguous. Here, systematic density functional theory computations reveal that the edge sites—zigzag and armchair—are responsible for the activity of the graphene-based Co (cobalt) SACs toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Then, edge-rich (E)-Co single atoms (SAs) were rationally synthesized guided by theoretical results. Supervised learning techniques are applied to interpret the measured synchrotron spectrum of E-Co SAs. The obtained local environments of Co SAs, 65.49% of Co-4N-plane, 13.64% in Co-2N-armchair, and 20.86% in Co-2N-zigzag, are consistent with Athena fitting. Remarkably, E-Co SAs show even better HER electrocatalytic performance than commercial Pt/C at high current density. Using the joint effort of theoretical modeling, thorough characterization of the catalysts aided by supervised learning, and catalytic performance evaluations, this study not only uncovers the activity origin of Co SACs for HER but also lays the cornerstone for the rational design and structural analysis of nanocatalysts.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202100547

Herein, Fe single atoms and clusters co-embedded in N-doped carbon (Fe/NC) that deliver the synergistic enhancement in pH-universal ORR catalysis via the four-electron pathway are reported. Combining a series of experimental and computational analyses, the geometric and electronic structures of catalytic sites in Fe/NC are revealed and the neighboring Fe clusters are shown to weaken the binding energies of the ORR intermediates on Fe–N sites, hence enhancing both catalytic kinetics and thermodynamics. This strategy provides new insights into the understanding of the mechanism of single atom catalysis.",Small Methods,10.1002/smtd.202001165
Nickel single atom-decorated carbon nanosheets as multifunctional electrocatalyst supports toward efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution,"© 2021Tailoring catalysts with balanced adsorption capabilities toward multiple reaction intermediates is highly desirable for complex electrocatalytic reactions, but rather challenging. Here, Ni single atom-decorated carbon nanosheets are developed as multifunctional supports for engineering heterostructured electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution in alkaline media. The Ni single atoms (Ni–N4) are actively dedicated to cleaving the H–OH bonds as well as facilitating Had spillover to metallic Pt sites. For the case of supported Pt electrocatalysts, a Pt/PtOx configuration is generated at the heterointerface via Pt–O–C (Ni) interfacial bonding, with oxidized Pt species located at the interface and metallic Pt formed in the near-interface area. Further, the oxidized Pt species are also active for boosting the water dissociation step. These findings not only open up a new avenue toward the development of multifunctional catalyst supports but also demonstrate the importance of regulating interface chemistry of heterostructured electrocatalysts at atomic level.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.105850
Single Mo atom supported on defective BC2N monolayers as promising electrochemical catalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.First-principles calculation has been performed to systematically investigate the NRR catalytic performance of a single Mo atom supported on two BC2N monolayers with different defects. It is found that the Mo atom can be stably anchored on type-A BC2N monolayer with the defect of VBC, the NRR catalytic activity of which will be promoted. From the exhaustive discussion of possible catalytic pathways, further calculation has predicted that the Mo@type-A with VBC exhibited the quite low overpotential of 0.441 V via the distal mechanism. In addition, the type-B BC2N with VCC is suited for the substrate of SACs, and the Mo@type-B VCC also has outstanding catalytic performance through an alternating mechanism, due to an overpotential value of 0.516 V. This study calls for more attention to various defects of BC2N monolayers, and give guidance to develop more effective SACs for nitrogen reduction reaction.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.149131
Solid-State Synthesis of Highly Dispersed Nitrogen-Coordinated Single Iron Atom Electrocatalysts for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Fe-N-C with atomically dispersed Fe single atoms is the most promising candidate to replace platinum for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, the conventional synthesis procedures require quantities solvents and metal precursors, sluggish adsorption process, and tedious washing, resulting in limited metal doping and uneconomical for large-scale production. For the first time, Fe2O3 is adopted as the Fe precursor to derive abundant single Fe atoms dispersed on carbon surfaces. The Fe-N-C catalyst synthesized by this simple method shows an excellent ORR activity with half-wave potentials of 0.82 and 0.90 V in acidic and alkaline solutions, respectively. A single fuel cell with an optimized Fe-N-C cathode shows a high peak power density of 0.84 W cm-2. The solid-state transformation synthesis method developed in this study may shed light on mass production of single-atom-based catalysts.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c00702
Modulation of Cu and Rh single-atoms and nanoparticles for high-performance hydrogen evolution activity in acidic media,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.The design of a highly efficient and durable electrocatalyst for the production of hydrogenviaelectrochemical water splitting is highly desirable but remains a tremendous challenge. Though there has been some progress in basic media wherein the reaction is sluggish, here we report the synthesis of a new hybrid catalyst comprising Cu and Rh elements as bimetallic single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) on a N-doped graphene (GN) surface (1: Cu/Rh(SAs) + Cu2Rh(NPs)/GN) that works remarkably fast for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. Benefiting from the large specific electrochemical surface area, low charge transfer resistance and combined synergistic effect of bimetallic SAs and NPs, the as-obtained catalyst1requires an overpotential as low as 8 mV (commercial Pt/C requires 14 mV) in 0.5 M H2SO4solution to deliver a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm−2. It maintains constant current densities (∼10-100 mA cm−2) at both low and high overpotentials during the 500 h continuous HER electrolysis chronoamperometry test. Moreover,1exhibits a low Tafel slope (27 mV dec−1), a high turnover frequency and mass activity (1.237 s−1and 2.314 A mgRh−1) which are higher than those of Pt/C (0.329 s−1and 0.326 A mgPt−1) and a constant H2production rate with high faradaic efficiency (98-99%). Electrochemical experiments in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the combination of Rh and Cu atoms on the GNsurface not only maximizes the rates of H+adsorption on the electrode surface (due to the high surface area of1) but also optimizes the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) close to zero (0.01 eV), improving the intrinsic catalytic activity for the HER.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta01067k
Spatially Confined Formation of Single Atoms in Highly Porous Carbon Nitride Nanoreactors,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Reducing the size of a catalyst to a single atom (SA) level can dramatically change its physicochemical properties and significantly boost its catalytic activity. However, the massive synthesis of SA catalysts still remains a grand challenge mainly because of the aggregation and nucleation of the generated atoms during the reaction. Here, we design and implement a spatially confined synthetic strategy based on a porous-hollow carbon nitride (p-CN) coordinated with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate, which can act as a nanoreactor and allow us to obtain metal SA catalysts (p-CN@M SAs). This relatively easy and highly effective method provides a way to massively synthesize single/multiple atoms (p-CN@M SAs, M = Pt, Pd, Cu, Fe, etc.). Moreover, the amorphous NiB-coated p-CN@Pt SAs can further increase the loading amount of Pt SAs to 3.7 wt %. The synthesized p-CN@Pt&NiB electrocatalyst exhibits an extraordinary hydrogen evolution reaction activity with the overpotential of 40.6 mV@10 mA/cm-2 and the Tofel slope of 29.26 mV/dec.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.1c01872
Engineering Ag-N xSingle-Atom Sites on Porous Concave N-Doped Carbon for Boosting CO2Electroreduction,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers an environmentally benign pathway for renewable energy conversion and further regulation of the environmental CO2 concentration to achieve carbon cycling. However, developing desired electrocatalysts with high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) at an ultralow overpotential remains a grand challenge. Herein, we report an effective CO2RR electrocatalyst that features Ag single-atom coordinated with three nitrogen atoms (Ag1-N3) anchored on porous concave N-doped carbon (Ag1-N3/PCNC), which is identified by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Ag1-N3/PCNC shows a low CO2RR onset potential of -0.24 V, high maximum FECO of 95% at -0.37 V, and high CO partial current density of 7.6 mA cm-2 at -0.55 V, exceeding most of the previous Ag electrocatalysts. The in situ infrared absorption spectra technique proves that Ag1-N3 single-atom sites have sole linear-adsorbed CO and can easily desorb *CO species to achieve the highest CO selectivity in comparison with the corresponding counterparts. This work provides significant inspiration on boosting CO2RR by tuning the active center at an atomic level to achieve a specific absorption with an intermediate.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c03638
Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single-Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHDeveloping the low-cost and efficient single-atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first-principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron-vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single-TM-atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N2 adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state-of-the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of −0.62 V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH3 production by carbon-based single-atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.",Chemistry - A European Journal,10.1002/chem.202005182
Unraveling electrochemical CO reduction of the single-atom transition metals supported on N-doped phosphorene,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) sensitively depends on the activity of catalysts. Although some catalysts have been reported in previous studies, it remains a grand challenge to develop low cost but highly active electrocatalysts for CO reduction with high selectivity. Inspired by single atom metal-nitrogen-graphene catalysts, we theoretically explored the single atom metal-nitrogen-phosphorene catalysts MN3@P (P: monolayer black phosphorus, N: nitrogen atom, M = Mo, Mn, Fe, Co, Cr, Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd, V, and W) for the CO electrochemical reduction by the means of first-principle calculations. Two efficient catalysts, MoN3@P (limiting potential UL = −0.31 V) and MnN3@P (UL = −0.59 V) for methane (CH4) product of the CO reduction reaction, are identified for the first time. In particular, the UL on MoN3@P is significantly less negative than that of −0.74 V for CH4 product of Carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction on copper catalysts Cu(2 1 1). This remarkable low UL originates from the unique π bonding interaction near Fermi level between the 2p orbital of C atom in adsorbate *CO and 4d orbital of Mo atom in MoN3@P. Furthermore, MoN3@P and MnN3@P are expected to be long-term catalysts because of excellent kinetic stabilities.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.148953
Enhanced catalytic activity of MXene for nitrogen electoreduction reaction by carbon doping,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.The electrocatalytic performance of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is seriously hindered by the lack of cost-effective electrocatalysts with high-efficiency and high-selectivity. In this work, the NRR catalytic activity of single carbon (C) atom embedded into two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides (M2CO2, M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W) with oxygen vacancy was systematically evaluated by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations. Our results revealed that the embedded single C atom possesses good durability due to its strong interaction with metal atoms around vacancy in these MXenes. Interestingly, through high-throughput screening, the single C atoms anchored on Nb2CO2, Mo2CO2, and W2CO2 nanosheets are identified as promise NRR catalysts with high-activity due to their low limiting potentials (–0.14 to –0.38 V) via a distal mechanism and outstanding selectivity again the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Remarkably, the intrinsic activity of the C single atom supported by these MXenes mainly originates from the activation degree of the adsorbed N2 molecule, which is greatly dependent on the electron filling degree of pz orbital in C atom. Thus, by carefully choosing suitable substrates, the single C catalyst can be utilized as ideal NRR catalysts for NH3 synthesis.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2020.12.034
High-Throughput Screening of a Single-Atom Alloy for Electroreduction of Dinitrogen to Ammonia,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Exploring electrocatalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability is essential for the development of applicable electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis technology. By performing density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigated the potential of a series of transition-metal-doped Au-based single-atom alloys (SAAs) as promising electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). The overall process for the Au-based electrocatalyst suffers from the limiting potential arising from the first hydrogenation step of the reduction of ∗N2 to ∗NNH. However, SAAs showed to be favorable toward lowering free energy barriers by increasing the binding strength of N2. According to simulation results, three descriptors were proposed to describe the first hydrogenation step ΔG(∗N2 → ∗NNH): ΔG(∗NNH), d-band center, and d/√Em. Eight doped elements (Ti, V, Nb, Ru, Ta, Os, W, and Mo) were initially screened out with a limiting potential ranging from -0.75 to -0.30 V. Particularly, Mo- and W-doped systems possess the best activity with a limiting potential of -0.30 V each. Then, the intrinsic relationship between the structure and potential performance was analyzed using machine learning. The selectivity, feasibility, and stability of these candidates were also evaluated, confirming that SAA containing Mo, Ru, Ta, and W could be outstanding NRR electrocatalysts. This work not only broadens our understanding of SAA application in electrocatalysis, but also leads to the discovery of novel NRR electrocatalysts.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c01098
"First principles and machine learning based superior catalytic activities and selectivities for N2reduction in MBenes, defective 2D materials and 2D π-conjugated polymer-supported single atom catalysts","© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Production of ammonia through an electrochemical process suffers from two challenging issues, namely low catalytic activity and low Faraday efficiency. Here, we boost the N2reduction to NH3, while inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using novel two-dimensional (2D) transition metal borides (MBenes), defect-engineered 2D-materials, and 2D π-conjugated polymer (2DCP)-supported single-atom catalysts (SACs). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that nitrogen molecules can be captured in the hollow sites of MBenes, with significant increases in the adsorption strength and N-N bond length. Also, defective 2D-materials formed by the vacancy sites of Te, Se and S expose N2molecules to a specific environment adjacent to three transition metals, which drastically improves the catalytic activity and selectivity (by dramatic increase in the N-N bond length up to 1.38 Å). We report a new mechanism for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) as a combination of dissociative and associative mechanisms. A machine-learning (ML) based fast-screening strategy to predict efficient NRR electrocatalysts is described. Overall, TaB, NbTe2, NbB, HfTe2, MoB, MnB, HfSe2, TaSe2and Nb@SAC exhibit impressive selectivities over HER with overpotentials of 0.44 V, 0.40 V, 0.24 V, 0.60 V, 0.17 V, 0.17 V, 0.64 V, 0.37 V and 0.58 V, respectively. This study opens a new doorway to overcome previous drawbacks of 2D-materials for NRR.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta00751c
Exploring the synergistic effect of B-N doped defective graphdiyne for N2fixation,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2021.The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is currently the most attractive method for ammonia production, in which the development of high efficiency and low-cost electrocatalysts is still a challenge. A lot of recent research has been focused on B single-atom catalysts. However, doping carbon materials with multiple hetero-elements has been rarely explored. Herein, we investigate the catalytic performance of B doped, N doped, and BN co-doped defective graphdiyne (B@GDY, N@GDY and BN@GDY) for nitrogen reduction by using density functional theory. Our results reveal that BN@GDY exhibits higher catalytic efficiency relative to that of single B doping, which is manifested by a significant decrease in overpotential (0.32 Vvs.0.61 V)viathe enzymatic mechanism. The projected density of states and Bader charge analysis indicate that BN@GDY can promote the charge transfer from the catalytic substrate to adsorbed N2, in which the addition of N can convert B from sp2to sp3hybridization. Meanwhile, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can be well inhibited during the NRR for both B/BN@GDY substrates, especially in BN@GDY, indicating the high selectivity of BN@GDY towards the NRR. Above all, this work puts forward a novel metal-free electrocatalyst for the NRR and may provide useful guidance for the design of new non-metal nitrogen reduction electrocatalysts.",New Journal of Chemistry,10.1039/d1nj00163a
Ultralow non-noble metal loaded MOF derived bi-functional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.The rational design of efficient electrode materials for fuel cells, water oxidation, and metal-air batteries is now cutting-edge activity in renewable energy research. In this regard, tuning activity at the molecular level is one of the most challenging problems. Here, we have strategically employed two isophthalate-based ligands to tune the molecular structure and chemical bonding of three Co-based MOFs at the atomic level. MOFs were well characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The assembly of Co in these three novel MOFs at the atomic level dictates the catalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The catalytic activity of these MOFs has been boosted further upon annealing thereby forming highly efficient noble-metal-free Co-single atom catalysts where the amount of cobalt is extremely low.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta12439g
Boosting Electroreduction Kinetics of Nitrogen to Ammonia via Tuning Electron Distribution of Single-Atomic Iron Sites,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHElectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) plays a vital role for next-generation electrochemical energy conversion technologies. However, the NRR kinetics is still limited by the sluggish hydrogenation process on noble-metal-free electrocatalyst. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of a hybrid catalyst with atomic iron sites anchored on a N,O-doped porous carbon (FeSA-NO-C) matrix of an inverse opal structure, leading to a remarkably high NH3 yield rate of 31.9 μg (Formula presented.) h−1 mg−1cat. and Faradaic efficiency of 11.8 % at −0.4 V for NRR electrocatalysis, outperformed almost all previously reported atomically dispersed metal-nitrogen-carbon catalysts. Theoretical calculations revealed that the observed high NRR catalytic activity for the FeSA-NO-C catalyst stemmed mainly from the optimized charge-transfer between the adjacent O and Fe atoms homogenously distributed on the porous carbon support, which could not only significantly facilitate the transportation of N2 and ions but also effectively decrease the binding energy between the isolated Fe atom and *N2 intermediate and the thermodynamic Gibbs free energy of the rate-determining step (*N2 → *NNH).",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202100526
Single-atom metal-N4site molecular electrocatalysts for ambient nitrogen reduction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Electrochemical N2reduction to NH3is an emerging energy technology, attracting much attention due to its features of mild reaction conditions and being non-polluting. In this work, we demonstrate that a well-defined cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP) molecule as a model catalyst exhibits good electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction activity in 0.1 M HCl electrolyte with an ammonia yield of 15.18 ± 0.78 µg h-1mg-1cat.calculated by the indophenol blue method and a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 11.43 ± 0.74%. The catalyst also has satisfactory electrolytic stability and recycling test reusability. The activity displayed by the porphyrin molecular catalysts is attributed to the full exposure of the metal-N4sites. To trace the source of ammonia, an isotope labeling experiment (15N2as the feed gas) is used to calculate the ammonia yieldvia1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which is close to that of the indophenol blue method. In addition, we replace the central metal to prepare CuTPP and MnTPP, and they also show electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) ability. This work proves the feasibility and versatility of using metalloporphyrin molecules as model electrocatalysts for NRR and offers a new strategy for the further development of molecular NRR catalysts.",Catalysis Science and Technology,10.1039/d1cy00022e
Understanding trends in the activity and selectivity of bi-atom catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Electrocatalytic CO2reduction offers a promising approach to produce valuable chemicals using greenhouse gas as the feedstock, although the reduction efficiency on conventional transition metal catalysts is limited by the inherent scaling relations. How to break this scaling relation becomes crucial for improving the catalytic efficiency. Recent experiments have witnessed great advances in precisely controlling the synthesis of bi-atom catalysts (BACs), which contributes to their unique catalytic properties being different from single-atom catalysts (SACs) and nanoparticles. However, atomic-level insights into the structure-properties relationship of BACs have become a great challenge. Herein, we develop a fundamental understanding of the trends in the catalytic activity of homo- and hetero-nuclear BACsvialarge-scale DFT calculations. We demonstrate that homonuclear BACs still follow the scaling relations. By constructing heteronuclear BACs from metal groups with strong COOH* adsorption (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Mo, and Ta) and weak CO* adsorption (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Rh, and Ir), the linear relationships could significantly be broken, caused by the different O- and C-affinity of the heterocenters that work synergistically to affect the adsorption of CO2and COOH*/HCOO*. The adsorption of *CO, however, cannot be easily tuned due to its single coordination mode. In terms of the reaction selectivity, the primary product with homonuclear BACs was CO or HCOOH, while the heteronuclear BACs mainly produce CO or H2. Our analysis shows an efficient design feature to modulate the adsorption of COOH* (HCOO*) without regulating CO*, which provides useful insight into the design of efficient multi-active-site CO2RR electrocatalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta01120k
High-voltage asymmetric metal–air batteries based on polymeric single-Zn2+-ion conductor,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Asymmetric-electrolyte metal–air batteries (AMABs) deliver high operating voltage and energy density. However, the demand for ion-selective transport separator and precious metal electrocatalysts hampers their applications. To address this issue, we develop a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) separator that can selectively transport Zn2+ ions and an atomically dispersed Co electrocatalyst that can catalyze oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) in the challenging acidic medium. The selective ion transport behavior was associated with the Zn2+ ions’ bonded ladder structure of PAN, which raises the ion migration energy barrier for the crossover of H+ and OH−. In terms of electrocatalysts, extensive ex situ and in situ characterizations suggest that Co single-atom sites stably catalyze the OER and ORR. Several types of AMABs (metals Zn, Si, Sn) were tested. The assembled asymmetric metal–air Zn-, Si-, and Sn-air batteries delivered enhanced battery performance that surpassed those of recently reported Zn-, Si-, and Sn-air batteries, respectively. Metal–air batteries (MABs) based on earth-abundant metals (e.g., Zn, Si, Fe, Sn) are promising candidates for energy storage due to their high theoretical energy densities and potentially low capital cost (<$150/kWh, DOE, 2023 target). However, MABs using aqueous electrolytes deliver low cell voltage resulting in inferior energy densities. Construction of asymmetric-electrolyte metal–air batteries (AMABs) can substantially improve the cell voltage. Nonetheless, the performance of state-of-the-art AMABs employing either NASICON-type ceramic membrane or bipolar polymer membrane is far from satisfactory due to the issues such as low ion conductivity and crossover of H+ and OH− ions. Here, we report a cost-effective polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based membrane that can selectively transport Zn2+ ions while inhibiting crossover of H+ and OH− ions. The corresponding AMABs (metals Zn, Si, Sn) show significantly enhanced battery performance that surpasses most of recently reported MABs.",Matter,10.1016/j.matt.2021.01.004
Effects of Superparamagnetic Iron Nanoparticles on Electrocatalysts for the Reduction of Oxygen,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.It is of great research interest to understand the nanostructures contributing to the activity observed in the reduction of oxygen by non-platinum group metal (PGM) electrocatalysts in acidic media. Iron- and nitrogen-containing carbon networks are often the most studied structures, among which single-atom iron-coordinated nitrogen (FeNx) moieties have often been proposed to be the structures leading to the high activity in these non-PGM electrocatalysts. Iron nanoparticles embedded within a carbon support are also formed under certain conditions as a result of the synthetic processes in making non-PGM electrocatalysts. In this study, we present a study to understand the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of prepared iron- and nitrogen-containing non-PGM electrocatalysts obtained through the pyrolysis of metal-organic framework (MOF) precursors. We studied the structure-property relationship among nanostructures made from the MOF precursor ZIF-8 under different pyrolysis conditions. Density functional theory calculations were used to explain the effect of structural moieties on the ORR activity.

Single Atomic Cerium Sites with a High Coordination Number for Efficient Oxygen Reduction in Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Fe-N-C electrocatalysts, as a representative of platinum group metal-free (PGM-free) catalysts, exhibit a comparable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity but insufficient stability to that of commercial Pt/C in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), due to the unavoidable Fenton's reactions. Herein, we report a hard-template approach to synthesize the rare-earth single-cerium-atom-doped metal-organic frameworks with a hierarchically macro-meso-microporous structure. Spherical aberration correction electron microscopy confirms the atomic dispersion of Ce sites. Additionally, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was employed to further verify the coordination environment of Ce sites, which were stabilized by four-coordinated nitrogen atoms and six-oxygen atoms (Ce-N4/O6). The Ce sites were embedded in a hierarchically macro-meso-microporous N-doped carbon (Ce SAS/HPNC) catalyst, which exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.862 V in ORR and the highest power density of 0.525 W cm-2 under 2.0 bar H2/O2 in the fuel cell test.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.0c05503

Single Co-Atoms as Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrazine Oxidation Reaction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) have aroused great attention due to their high atom efficiency and unprecedented catalytic properties. A remaining challenge is to anchor the single atoms individually on support materials via strong interactions. Herein, single atom Co sites have been developed on functionalized graphene by taking advantage of the strong interaction between Co2+ ions and the nitrile group of cyanographene. The potential of the material, which is named G(CN)-Co, as a SAC is demonstrated using the electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). The material exhibits excellent catalytic activity for HzOR, driving the reaction with low overpotential and high current density while remaining stable during long reaction times. Thus, this material can be a promising alternative to conventional noble metal-based catalysts that are currently widely used in HzOR-based fuel cells.

Potassium-Ion Activating Formation of Fe−N−C Moiety as Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalyst for Zn-Air Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHDeveloping a new synthesis methodology to obtain an economical and stable single atom oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst is highly desirable. Herein, we develop a general ionic salt assisted template method to obtain M−N−C (M=Fe and Co) catalyst with improved ORR activity. The creation of M−N−C single atom catalyst is highly dependent on the nature of ionic salt templates. Compared with NaCl, KCl can not only act as template, but also create more defect sites for single iron atom to anchor through metallic K-intercalation activation at elevated temperatures, which results in the generation of more single atomic M−N−C active sites. Furthermore, the ionic salt template-assisted method leads to the formation of interconnected porous structure with sufficient micropores and a high surface area of 514 m2 g−1. As an ORR and Zn-air battery catalyst, Fe−N−C−KCl shows a half-wave potential of 0.877 V and a maximum power density of 185 mW cm−2, respectively, outperforming those of state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst.

Universal domino reaction strategy for mass production of single-atom metal-nitrogen catalysts for boosting CO2 electroreduction,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdDeveloping efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 conversion into value-added chemicals is highly desirable, but it still remains a great challenge to achieve scalable production of these catalysts that displays simultaneously the high product selectivity and large current density at a low overpotential. Here, we develop a universal domino reaction strategy for mass production of metal single atoms anchored on N-doped carbon nanosheets (M-SA/NC), including Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Mo, Pd and combinations thereof (among FeCo, FeNi, FeCoNi) SA/NC by ball-milling of polyaniline (PANI) with appropriate salts (e.g., NiCl2, NaCl and NaNO3), followed by pyrolysis. During pyrolysis, NaNO3 is decomposed in-situ to release gases capable of blowing PANI, then carbon sheets from carbonized PANI is etched by O2 to create microporous and the aggregated metal particles is etch by CO. The as-prepared Ni-SA/NC exhibits an extraordinary catalytic activity for CO2 reduction to CO, yielding a large current density of 213.2 mA cm−2 with CO Faradaic efficiency up to 96.9% at a low overpotential of 0.55 V in a flow cell. DFT calculations reveal that N atoms in NiN4 species act as the active sites for CO2RR, rather than conventional Ni atoms, since the neighboring pyrrolic-N induces electrons of Ni 4s orbitals shift to adjacent N 2s orbitals in NiN4, leading to a high N 2s electron density for facilitating the COOH* formation. This work provides not only a rational design concept for mass preparation of M-SA/NC heterogeneous electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction and beyond, but also a deep insight of an electron transfer mechanism for CO2RR.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105689
Single-atom electrocatalysts templated by MOF for determination of levodopa,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.To overcome the problem of incorrect levodopa (LD) dosage in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, a new analytical tool is urgently needed for accurately determining the concentration of LD in human fluids. Herein, an effective and stable sensor based on a Co-single-atomic-site catalyst (Co-SASC)-modified glassy carbon electrode (Co-SASC/GCE) was developed for the determination of LD concentration. The physicochemical characterization of Co-SASC is systematically investigated. It has excellent thermal stability, graphitization degree, and a large specific surface area. Benefiting from its porous structure for kinetically fast catalysis and component advantages for fix a single cobalt atom to improve stability, Co-SASC/GCE exhibits a superior electrochemical response. Under optimal conditions (pH 2.0, coating amount is 10 μg), an ideal linear relationship is achieved between the logarithm of the peak current of the sensor and the logarithm of LD concentration. The linear range is 0.1–200 μM, and the limit of detection (LOD) is 0.033 μM. After a simple pretreatment, LD in human serum is detected by Co-SASC/GCE with excellent stability and selectivity. As such, this work enlarges the existing electrochemical sensor toolbox by offering a reasonable design and synthesis protocol for advanced materials to accurately determine LD in human fluids for the clinical treatment of Parkinson's disease.",Talanta,10.1016/j.talanta.2020.122042
An Ion-Imprinting Derived Strategy to Synthesize Single-Atom Iron Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHCarbon-based single-atom catalysts (CSACs) have recently received extensive attention in catalysis research. However, the preparation process of CSACs involves a high-temperature treatment, during which metal atoms are mobile and aggregated into nanoparticles, detrimental to the catalytic performance. Herein, an ion-imprinting derived strategy is proposed to synthesize CSACs, in which isolated metal–nitrogen–carbon (Me–N4–Cx) moiety covalently binds oxygen atoms in Si-based molecular sieve frameworks. Such a feature makes Me–N4–Cx moiety well protected/confined during the heat treatment, resulting in the final material enriched with single-atom metal active sites. As a proof of concept, a single-atom Fe–N–C catalyst is synthesized by using this ion-imprinting derived strategy. Experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate high concentration of single FeN4 active sites distributed in this catalyst, resulting in an outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance with a half-wave potential of 0.908 V in alkaline media.",Small,10.1002/smll.202004454
Designed Iron Single Atom Catalysts for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Alkaline and Acid Media,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted much attentions due to their advantages of high catalysis efficiency and excellent selectivity. However, for industrial applications, synthesis of SACs in large and practical quantities is very important. The challenge is to develop synthesis methods with controllability and scalability. Herein, a well-characterized and scalable method is demonstrated to synthesize atomically dispersed iron atoms coordinated with nitrogen on graphene, SAFe @ NG, with high atomic loading (≈4.6 wt%) through a one-pot pyrolysis process. The method is scalable for the fabrication of Fe SACs with high quantities. The Fe–N–G catalyst exhibits high intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance, reaching half potential of 0.876 and 0.702 V in alkaline and acidic solutions, respectively, with excellent microstructure stability. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) simulation confirms that the Fe atoms in coordination with four nitrogen atoms, FeN4, in graphene is the active center for the 4-electron ORR process. This work demonstrates an efficient design pathway for single atom catalysts as highly active and stable electrocatalysts for high-performance ORR applications.",Advanced Materials Interfaces,10.1002/admi.202001788
Computational Design of Single Mo Atom Anchored Defective Boron Phosphide Monolayer as a High-performance Electrocatalyst for the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction,"© 2020 Zhengzhou UniversityCatalytic reduction of molecular dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) is one of the most important and challenging industrial reactions. Electrochemical reduction is considered as an energy-saving technology for artificial ambient nitrogen fixation, which is emerging as an optimal potential sustainable strategy to substitute for the Haber–Bosch process. However, this process demands efficient catalysts for the N2 reduction reaction (NRR). Here, by means of first-principles calculations, we systematically explored the potential electrocatalytic performance of single transition metal atoms (Pd, Ag, Rh, Cu, Ti, Mo, Mn, Zn, Fe, Co, Ru, and Pt) embedded in monolayer defective boron phosphide (TMs/BP) monolayer with a phosphorus monovacancy for ambient NH3 production. Among them, the Mo/BP exhibits the best catalytic performance for ambient reduction of N2 through the typical enzymatic and consecutive reaction pathways with an activation barrier of 0.68 eV, indicating that Mo/BP is an efficient catalyst for N2 fixation. We believe that this work could provide a new avenue of ambient NH3 synthesis by using the designed single-atom electrocatalysts.",Energy and Environmental Materials,10.1002/eem2.12120
Computational Study of Transition-Metal Substitutions in Rutile TiO2 (110) for Photoelectrocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis,"© 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Abstract: Synthesis of ammonia through photo- and electrocatalysis is a rapidly growing field. Titania-based catalysts are widely reported for photocatalytic ammonia synthesis and have also been suggested as electrocatalysts. The addition of transition-metal dopants is one strategy for improving the performance of titania- based catalysts. In this work, we screen d-block transition- metal dopants for surface site stability and evaluate trends in their performance as the active site for the reduction of nitrogen to ammonia on TiO2. We find a linear relationship between the d-band center and metal substitution energy of the dopant site, while the binding energies of N2, N2H, and NH2 all are strongly correlated with the cohesive energies of the dopant metals. The activity of the metal-doped systems shows a volcano type relationship with the NH2 and N2H energies as descriptors. Some metals such as Co, Mo, and V are predicted to slightly improve photo- and electrocatalytic performance, but most metals inhibit the ammonia synthesis reaction. The results provide insight into the role of transition-metal dopants for promoting ammonia synthesis, and the trends are based on unexpected electronic structure factors that may have broader implications for single-atom catalysis and doped oxides.

3D star-like atypical hybrid MOF derived single-atom catalyst boosts oxygen reduction catalysis,"© 2020Developing high-efficiency, stable and non-precious electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is highly important for energy conversion and storage. Single atom catalysts (SACs) show good potential in enhancing ORR, however, the specifical control over the coordination surroundings around single metal center to intrinsically modify the electron structure is still a great challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that a 3D hybrid MOF composed of cobalt doped ZIF-L and ZIF-8, featuring star morphology with six equal branches, can be used as an advanced precursor for making the Co SACs for greatly boosted ORR. The as-synthesized CoSA-N-C exhibits excellent ORR activity with E1/2 of 0.891 V in alkaline medium, outperforming the commercial Pt/C by 39 mV. Moreover, the E1/2 of CoSA-N-C (0.790 V) is merely 15 mV, less than that of Pt/C (0.805 V) in acid medium, which is among the best in the reported state-of-the-art SACs. DFT calculations demonstrate that the enhanced ORR performance is assigned to the formation of atomically isolated cobalt atom coordinated three N atoms and one C atom, which is easier to decrease the free energy of rate determining step and accelerate the ORR process than that of traditional cobalt atom coordinated four N atoms. In addition, a primary Zn-air battery with CoSA-N-C cathode reveals a maximum power density of 92.2 mW cm−2 at 120.0 mA cm−2, far higher than that of commercial catalysts (74.2 mW cm−2 at 110.0 mA cm−2).",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2020.06.059
Identifying the Zn–Co binary as a robust bifunctional electrocatalyst in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions via shifting the apexes of the volcano plot,"© 2020 Science PressThe performance of an electrocatalyst is closely correlated with the binding strength of key oxygen-containing intermediates, i.e., *OOH, *O and *OH, in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Facile strategies to achieve favorable binding strength of these oxygen-containing species are urgently demanded, yet it still remains great challenges. Herein, the Zn–Co bimetallic isolation, which serves as an ideal model, is studied systematically by the density functional theory (DFT). Reaction activity volcano plots are built from 48 models, among them the ZnCoN6-gra(I) configuration is confirmed to be the most stable, featured of the strongest interaction with the oxygen-containing species. Optimal ΔG*O (free energy change of an atomic oxygen containing intermediate) is facilitated, which effectively drifts the volcano peaks of ORR and OER closer to each other, enabling promising bifunctional catalyst. Moreover, the small overpotential in the simulation of protonation and oxidation by hydroxy groups rationalizes the durability of the catalyst in both acid and alkaline media.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2020.07.010
Electrocatalytic Reduction of N2Using Metal-Doped Borophene,"© Ammonia synthesis is an essential process in chemistry and industry. However, it is limited by the lack of efficient catalysts and high energy costs. Developing highly efficient systems for ammonia synthesis is an important and long-standing challenge. In this paper, a large class of metal atoms (including 3d/4d transition metals and main group metals) anchored onto borophene have been studied as single atom catalysts for ammonia synthesis. After comprehensive computational screening and systematic evaluation, four candidates stand out. We predict that Mo, Mn, Tc, and Cr@BM-β12 will have superior performance for catalytic reduction of N2 to NH3 with low limiting potentials of -0.26, -0.32, -0.38, and -0.48 V, respectively. Furthermore, we studied the activity of the competitive HER on M@BM-β12. The results implied that the two materials Mo@BM-β12 and Mn@BM-β12 showed HER suppression. These properties exceed most currently reported nitrogen reduction reaction electrocatalysts. Our results suggest the possibility of efficient electrochemical reduction of N2 to NH3 in a lower energy process.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c20553
Rational Fabrication of Low-Coordinate Single-Atom Ni Electrocatalysts by MOFs for Highly Selective CO2 Reduction,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interests due to their ultrahigh activity and selectivity. However, the rational control over coordination microenvironment of SACs remains a grand challenge. Herein, a post-synthetic metal substitution (PSMS) strategy has been developed to fabricate single-atom Ni catalysts with different N coordination numbers (denoted Ni-Nx-C) on pre-designed N-doped carbon derived from metal-organic frameworks. When served for CO2 electroreduction, the obtained Ni-N3-C catalyst achieves CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 95.6 %, much superior to that of Ni-N4-C. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower Ni coordination number in Ni-N3-C can significantly enhance COOH* formation, thereby accelerating CO2 reduction. In addition, Ni-N3-C shows excellent performance in Zn–CO2 battery with ultrahigh CO FE and excellent stability. This work opens up a new and general avenue to coordination microenvironment modulation (MEM) of SACs for CO2 utilization.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202016219
Active Site Engineering in Transition Metal Based Electrocatalysts for Green Energy Applications,"© 2022 Accounts of Materials Research.Conspectus Hydrogen is widely considered an ideal green energy carrier and a leading candidate to replace nonrenewable fossil fuels and address serious global energy and environmental pollution issues. Scientists worldwide are engaged in developing various technologies related to hydrogen energy exploitation and conversion, such as photocatalytic/electrocatalytic water splitting, fuel cells, and so on. Electrocatalytic water splitting using electric energy can produce clean and pure hydrogen from water on a large scale, which can be further directly converted into electric energy by fuel cells. This environmentally friendly system relies on a series of important reactions, especially the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which both require high efficiency and durable electrocatalysts. Despite the tremendous efforts of the scientific community, electrocatalysts with satisfactory performance are still lacking. At the heart of electrocatalysts, active sites are key to catalytic performance. Active site engineering, by tuning the nature of the active sites in the electrocatalysts, offers an important opportunity to improve the performance of electrocatalysts. Typically, the strategies for active site engineering involve (1) tailoring the environment around the active sites and (2) engineering the structure of the active sites. These approaches can be used to optimize the electronic properties of the active sites, balance the binding energies between the active sites and the reactants/intermediates/products, and thus accelerate the overall reaction processes.In this Account, we summarize the recent progress made in our laboratory on active site engineering in transition metal based electrocatalysts for green energy applications. We start with metal nanoparticle electrocatalysts, engineering Ru nanoparticles on different supports, to achieve more efficient electrocatalytic HER performance. Next, after we theoretically predicted that the hydrogen adsorption/desorption on iridium (Ir) sites could be balanced by environmental carbon/nitrogen atoms, we anchored Ir nanoparticles on the nitrogenated carbon supports, accelerating the acidic hydrogen evolution catalysis. In subsequent sections, we present how engineering active sites with different structures in metal single atom electrocatalysts achieved enhanced oxygen reduction catalysis. We also demonstrate that active site engineering in metal carbide/phosphide electrocatalysts with defects, surface atomic arrangements and heteroatoms can also improve the catalytic activities of the active sites. This Account highlights the engineering of efficient active sites in transition metal based electrocatalysts using robust strategies, which may offer new opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts for various energy applications.",Accounts of Materials Research,10.1021/accountsmr.0c00110
Atomically Dispersed Indium Sites for Selective CO2Electroreduction to Formic Acid,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.An atomically dispersed structure is attractive for electrochemically converting carbon dioxide (CO2) to fuels and feedstock due to its unique properties and activity. Most single-atom electrocatalysts are reported to reduce CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO). Herein, we develop atomically dispersed indium (In) on a nitrogen-doped carbon skeleton (In-N-C) as an efficient catalyst to produce formic acid/formate in aqueous media, reaching a turnover frequency as high as 26771 h-1 at -0.99 V relative to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Electrochemical measurements show that trace amounts of In loaded on the carbon matrix significantly improve the electrocatalytic behavior for the CO2 reduction reaction, outperforming conventional metallic In catalysts. Further experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the formation of intermediate *OCHO on isolated In sites plays a pivotal role in the efficiency of the CO2-to-formate process, which has a lower energy barrier than that on metallic In.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.1c00858
Nickel-Based Single-Atom Catalyst toward Triiodide Reduction Reaction in Hybrid Photovoltaics,"© It is very significant to obtain highly efficient, cost-effective, and durable electrocatalysts toward triiodide reduction reaction (TRR) in hybrid photovoltaics. In this study, a nickel-based single-atom catalyst (SAC) (Ni-SAC) was prepared by the facile carbonization of NiPc@ZIF-8 and explored as a highly efficient Pt-free catalyst for TRR. During the carbonization process, the Ni species were separated by coordinate nitrogen atoms and distributed homogeneously within the porous carbon matrix, with the formation of the atomically dispersed Ni-N4 active sites, revealed by the X-ray absorption fine structure and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. Compared to the reference porous nitrogen-doped carbon, Ni-SAC exhibited superior catalytic activity toward TRR. More importantly, Ni-SAC possessed better stability over the triiodide/iodide redox couple than the Pt counterpart during the stability test. The resultant solar cell presented an efficiency of 7.42%, comparable to that of the Pt-based device (7.69%). Additionally, the Kelvin probe force microscopy measurement revealed that the enhanced catalytic activity of Ni-SAC originated from the moderate energy level matching with the triiodide/iodide redox couple. The formation of Ni-N4 active sites within the carbon matrix promoted the electron transferring at the interfaces of the catalyst/electrolyte. All results demonstrated that the SAC could be one of the Pt-free catalysts toward efficient TRR in hybrid photovoltaics.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c00536
Single Atom Ruthenium-Doped CoP/CDs Nanosheets via Splicing of Carbon-Dots for Robust Hydrogen Production,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHUltrathin two-dimensional catalysts are attracting attention in the field of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This work describe a composite material design in which CoP nanoparticles doped with Ru single-atom sites supported on carbon dots (CDs) single-layer nanosheets formed by splicing CDs (Ru1CoP/CDs). Small CD fragments bore abundant functional groups, analogous to pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and could provide a high density of binding sites to immobilize Ru1CoP. The single-particle-thick nanosheets formed by splicing CDs acted as supports, which improved the conductivity of the electrocatalyst and the stability of the catalyst during operation. The Ru1CoP/CDs formed from doping atomic Ru dispersed on CoP showed very high efficiency for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over a wide pH range. The catalyst prepared under optimized conditions displayed outstanding stability and activity: the overpotential for the HER at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was as low as 51 and 49 mV under alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. Density functional theory calculations showed that the substituted Ru single atoms lowered the proton-coupled electron transfer energy barrier and promoted H−H bond formation, thereby enhancing catalytic performance for the HER. The findings open a new avenue for developing carbon-based hybridization materials with integrated electrocatalytic performance for water splitting.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202017102
Fe ultra-small particles anchored on carbon aerogels to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction in Zn-air batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.In this work, ultra-small Fe particles (Fe-UPs) anchored on carbon aerogel (CA) (Fe-UP/CA catalysts) are successfully prepared by the optimal pyrolysis of hollow composite particles of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF) coated with coordination complexes of tannic acid (TA) and Fe precursors. Within these Fe-UPs, each Fe-N4moiety is separated by one O atom while each Fe atom is coordinated with four N atoms and one O atom. The as-prepared Fe-UPs composed of the Fe-N4-O-Fe-N4moiety (FeFe-O-Fe-UPs) are proposed as a new type of active species for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, different types of active species (such as Fe single atoms, FeFe-O-Fe-UPs, and Fe nanoparticles) in the CA can be controlled by rationally adjusting the Fe-to-TA molar ratios. More importantly, FeFe-O-Fe-UPs in Fe-UP/CA catalysts are realized at an Fe-to-TA molar ratio of 2.2. With the merits of both Fe-single atom and traditional Fe-NPs, the as-prepared FeFe-O-Fe-UP/CA catalysts are able to regulate properly the adsorption of reactants and the desorption of intermediates and products due to their increasing size and the presence of the multi-metal-atom structure. Accordingly, the as-prepared FeFe-O-Fe-UP/CA catalysts towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) exhibit a higher half-wave potential (0.93 Vvs.0.89 V of Pt/C), a higher onset potential (1.08 Vvs.1.0 V of Pt/C), a higher kinetic current density (14.2 mA cm−2at 0.9 V) and better long-term stability in alkaline media. Additionally, Zn-air batteries assembled with such electrocatalysts also exhibit a higher power density of 140.1 mW cm−2and a larger specific capacity of 781.7 mA h g−1, which are better than those of the state-of-the-art the commercial Pt/C catalyst.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta00031d
A gel-limiting strategy for large-scale fabrication of Fe-N-C single-atom ORR catalysts,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Although transition metal single atom site catalysts (SASCs) show great potential for electrocatalysis, their large-scale controllable and flexible preparation remains a great challenge. In this article, we report a simple gel-limiting strategy for fabricating Fe-N-C single-atom catalysts and evaluate its feasibility in large-scale applications. The results show that the production of Fe-SASCs can be controlled by the limiting immobilization of a hydroxyl-rich temperature-controlled gel combined with simple centrifugal treatment, even if the amount of Fe-feeding fluctuates within a certain range. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the formation of Fe-N single-atom sites and the uniform distribution of Fe on commercial activated carbon. As an ORR electrocatalyst, the Fe-SASC delivered a higher limiting diffusion current, and more positive onset potential and half-wave potential (Eonset= 1.00 V,E1/2= 0.87 V), and excellent methanol resistance compared to commercial Pt/C (Eonset= 0.97 V,E1/2= 0.85 V). Using the prepared Fe-SASCs, a homemade Zn-air battery was assembled which demonstrated a higher open circuit voltage, power density, and stability, further proving the practical application value of our proposed method and as-prepared catalyst. More importantly, our reported strategy can be further developed and extended to the future preparation of more transition metal SASCs.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta09228b
Selective Activation of Propane Using Intermediates Generated during Water Oxidation,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Electrochemical conversion of light alkanes to high-value oxygenates provides an attractive avenue for eco-friendly utilization of these hydrocarbons. However, such conversion under ambient conditions remains exceptionally challenging due to the high energy barrier of C-H bond cleavage. Herein, we investigated theoretically the partial oxidation of propane on a series of single atom alloys by using active intermediates generated during water oxidation as the oxidant. We show that by controlling the potential and pH, stable surface oxygen atoms can be maintained under water oxidation conditions. The free energy barrier for C-H bond cleavage by the surface oxygen can be as small as 0.54 eV, which can be surmounted easily at room temperature. Our calculations identified three promising surfaces as effective propane oxidation catalysts. Our complementary experiments demonstrated the partial oxidation of propane to acetone on Ni-doped Au surfaces. We also investigated computationally the steps leading to acetone formation. These studies show that the concept of exploiting intermediates generated in water oxidation as oxidants provides a fruitful strategy for electrocatalyst design to efficiently convert hydrocarbons into value-added chemicals.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.1c00377
Single-Atom Rhodium on Defective g-C3N4: A Promising Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalyst,"© It is highly desirable to design bifunctional electrocatalysts to realize highly efficient oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR). Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to validate the feasibility of a single transition metal (TM) embedded in defective g-C3N4 for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. It was clarified that the TM atom supported on defective g-C3N4 with N vacancy (TM/VN-CN) was stable and possible to be synthesized. Remarkably, Rh/VN-CN exhibited low overpotentials of 0.32 and 0.43 V for OER and ORR, respectively, and was considered as the promising bifunctional catalyst. The volcano plots and contour maps were established based on the scaling relation of adsorption energies of *OH, *O, and *OOH. The OER/ORR activity origin was revealed by descriptors of the d-band center and the number of d-orbital electrons multiplied electronegativity of TM. Furthermore, the machine learning (ML) algorithm was utilized to analyze the intrinsic correlation between catalytic activity and a series of structural and atomic features. Our combined DFT and ML work not only opts for the promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts but also provides guidance for the design of single-atom catalysts and the discovery of more efficient catalysts.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c09192
Identifying Metallic Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides for Hydrogen Evolution through Multilevel High-Throughput Calculations and Machine Learning,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.High-performance electrocatalysts not only exhibit high catalytic activity but also have sufficient thermodynamic stability and electronic conductivity. Although metallic 1T-phase MoS2 and WS2 have been successfully identified to have high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction, designing more extensive metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) faces a large challenge because of the lack of a full understanding of electronic and composition attributes related to catalytic activity. In this work, we carried out systematic high-throughput calculation screening for all possible existing two-dimensional TMD (2D-TMD) materials to obtain high-performance hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts by using a few important criteria, such as zero band gap, highest thermodynamic stability among available phases, low vacancy formation energy, and approximately zero hydrogen adsorption energy. A series of materials - perfect monolayer VS2 and NiS2, transition-metal ion vacancy (TM-vacancy) ZrTe2 and PdTe2, chalcogenide ion vacancy (X-vacancy) MnS2, CrSe2, TiTe2, and VSe2 - have been identified to have catalytic activity comparable with that of Pt(111). More importantly, electronic structural analysis indicates active electrons induced by defects are mostly delocalized in the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest neighbor range, rather than a single-atom active site. Combined with the machine learning method, the HER-catalytic activity of metallic phase 2D-TMD materials can be described quantitatively with local electronegativity (0.195·LEf + 0.205·LEs) and valence electron number (Vtmx), where the descriptor is ΔGH* = 0.093 - (0.195·LEf + 0.205·LEs) - 0.15·Vtmx.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c03839
Single-Atom Catalysts for Improved Cathode Performance in Na-S Batteries: A Density Functional Theory (DFT) Study,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The room-temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries have attracted remarkable attention because of their promise to deliver high-capacity and low-cost earth-abundant sodium and sulfur. However, the practical development of Na-S batteries is hindered due to multiple challenges, including rapid capacity fading stems from the dissolution of intermediate sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn) and slow kinetics of electrochemical conversion reactions. In this study, we introduced novel transition-metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) to impede the dissolution of higher-order Na2Sn and improve otherwise sluggish kinetics of short-chain polysulfides. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to elucidate the detailed interactions of the polysulfides on the SACs. The pristine and nitrogen-doped graphenes are also considered and found to provide ineffective anchoring for trapping polysulfides. However, the SACs embedded via monodispersed transition-metal atoms in NG (TM-NG where TM = Cr, Fe, and Co) exhibit adequate binding strength toward Na2Sn species. The calculated adsorption energies of soluble Na2Sn on SACs are superior compared to that of commonly used ether-type electrolyte solvents; thus, the SACs are predicted to serve as effective immobilizers for soluble Na2Sn to prevent shuttling. The enhanced binding strength for TM-doped substrates arises from the strong TM-S covalent interactions. The density of state (DOS) calculations reveal that both the pristine and polysulfide adsorbed TM-NG exhibits metallic behavior and illustrate the mechanisms of stronger polysulfide interactions originated from the hybridization of TM-3d and S-2p orbitals. Furthermore, the electron-deficient SACs are found to substantially reduce the Na2S decomposition barrier, which demonstrates effective electrocatalysis in favor of complete reversible conversion of polysulfides. Overall, the effectiveness of the SACs on preventing shuttle effect and improving the kinetics of electrocatalytic conversion of polysulfides unraveled in this study will lead to a paradigm shift in developing advanced Na-S batteries with highly efficient electrocatalysts for Na2Sn conversion.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c00467
Single Nb or W Atom-Embedded BP Monolayers as Highly Selective and Stable Electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Fixation with Low-Onset Potentials,"© Conversion of dinitrogen (N2) molecules into ammonia through electrochemical methods is a promising alternative to the traditional Haber-Bosch process. However, searching for an eligible electrocatalyst with high stability, low-onset potential, and superior selectivity is still one of the most challenging and attractive topics for the electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR). Here, by means of first-principles calculations and the conductor-like screening model, four comprehensive criteria were proposed to screen out eligible NRR electrocatalysts from 29 atomic transition metals embedded on the defective boron phosphide (BP) monolayer with B-monovacancy (M/BP single-atom catalysts, SAC, M = Sc-Zn, Y-Cd, and Hf-Hg). Consequently, the Nb/BP and W/BP SACs are identified as the promising candidates, on which the N2 molecule can only be activated through the enzymatic pathway with the onset potentials of -0.25 and -0.19 V, and selectivities of 90.5 and 100%, respectively. It is worth noting that the W/BP SAC has the lowest overpotential among the 29 systems investigated. The electronic properties were also calculated in detail to analyze the activity origin. Importantly, the Nb/BP and W/BP SACs possess high thermal stabilities due to that their structures can be retained very well up to 1000 and 700 K, respectively. This work not only provides an efficient and reliable method to screen eligible NRR electrocatalysts but also paves a new way for advancing sustainable ammonia synthesis.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c21429
Single-Atom Alloys for the Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2021 The Authors. ChemPhysChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle-atom alloys (SAAs) consisting of isolated transition-metal atoms doped in the surface of coinage metal hosts exhibit unique catalytic properties, harnessing the high activity of the dopant metals with the selectivity of the coinage metal hosts. Here we use density functional theory (DFT) to study SAAs comprised of Ni, Pd, Pt, Co and Rh doped into Ag and Au hosts, as candidate electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel-cells. Our calculations reveal that the PdAu SAA exhibits a slightly lower theoretical overpotential, enhanced selectivity for 4-e− ORR, and tolerance to CO-poisoning compared to Pt(111). While the number of active sites of PdAu SAA is lower than that of Pt(111), the aforementioned desirable properties could bring the overall catalytic performance thereof close to that of Pt/C, indicating that the PdAu SAA could be a viable material for electrocatalytic ORR in PEM fuel-cells.",ChemPhysChem,10.1002/cphc.202000869
Solid–liquid phase transition induced electrocatalytic switching from hydrogen evolution to highly selective CO2 reduction,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.Conventional strategies for modifying electrocatalysts for efficient CO2 reduction are mainly based on doping, defect/morphology engineering, substrate design and so on. In most cases, these methods can only tune their structures, electronic states and thereby catalytic properties in a gradual way. Here we report that the solid–liquid phase transition of Ga–Sn/Ga–In alloys can induce an instant and radical transformation of their atomic and electronic structures during electrocatalysis, which dramatically impacts their catalytic properties. The transition of Sn/In active components from phase-segregated clusters to dispersed single atoms during melting results in a unique electronic structure through further reduction of both metallic Sn/In and Ga. Such atomic/electronic structure transitions can correlate well with suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction and an enhanced formate Faradaic efficiency from <35% to >95%. This two-state switching strategy may be extended to other catalytic reactions to determine correlations between their structures and catalytic properties.

Borophene−supported single transition metal atoms as potential oxygen evolution/reduction electrocatalysts: a density functional theory study,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.Due to the maximal atom utilization, high activity, and selectivity, the two-dimensional (2D) matrix supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted substantial research interests. In this work, we carried out the theoretical study on the stability, activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and its dependence on the electronic structure of transition metal (TM) anchored on two types of borophene (called β12 and χ3) by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results show that the early− and VIII−TM anchored β12 and χ3 borophenes are structurally and thermodynamically stable. The overpotentials of OER (ηOER) over the Ni supported on β12 and χ3 borophene SACs, designated as β12−Ni and χ3−Ni, are 0.38 and 0.35 V, respectively. The ηORR of β12−Ni and χ3−Ni are estimated to be as low as 0.34 and 0.39 V, respectively. The OER/ORR activity of the SACs can be well correlated with their electronic structures. The high ηOER values of early TM supported on borophene SACs correspond to high d-band center of TM. Both β12−Ni and χ3−Ni have a moderate d-band center. Since the overpotentials for OER and ORR on β12−Ni and χ3−Ni are comparable to those of Pt group metals and their oxides, β12−Ni and χ3−Ni can be considered as the promising bifunctional catalysts for OER and ORR.",Journal of Molecular Modeling,10.1007/s00894-021-04693-5
Highly Accessible Atomically Dispersed Fe-Nx Sites Electrocatalyst for Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell,"© 2021 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH GmbHAtomically dispersed transition metal-Nx sites have emerged as a frontier for electrocatalysis because of the maximized atom utilization. However, there is still the problem that the reactant is difficult to reach active sites inside the catalytic layer in the practical proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) testing, resulting in the ineffective utilization of the deeply hided active sites. In the device manner, the favorite structure of electrocatalysts for good mass transfer is vital for PEMFC. Herein, a facile one-step approach to synthesize atomically dispersed Fe-Nx species on hierarchically porous carbon nanostructures as a high-efficient and stable atomically dispersed catalyst for oxygen reduction in acidic media is reported, which is achieved by a predesigned hierarchical covalent organic polymer (COP) with iron anchored. COP materials with well-defined building blocks can stabilize the dopants and provide efficient mass transport. The appropriate hierarchical pore structure is proved to facilitate the mass transport of reactants to the active sites, ensuring the utilization of active sites in devices. Particularly, the structurally optimized HSAC/Fe-3 displays a maximum power density of up to 824 mW cm−2, higher than other samples with fewer mesopores. Accordingly, this work will offer inspirations for designing efficient atomically dispersed electrocatalyst in PEMFC device.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.202002249
Zeolitic imidazole framework-derived FeN5-doped carbon as superior CO2 electrocatalysts,"© 2020Electrochemical CO2 conversion offers a sustainable approach to alleviate the energy crisis but remains a long-standing challenge. Herein, atomically dispersed FeN5 sites anchored on N-doped carbon matrix templated by zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) are facilely synthesized for efficient catalyzing CO2 reduction. The FeN5 single-atom catalyst (Fe-SA/ZIF) presents the Faradaic efficiency of 98% at −0.7 V vs. RHE and over 95% in a wide potential range from −0.4 to −1.0 V vs. RHE, surpassing most of the reported single-atom catalysts for CO2RR. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the outstanding activity of FeN5 sites mainly originates from the lowered d-band center modulated by the out-of-plane coordinated pyridinic N, which reduces the CO adsorption energy from −1.71 to −1.49 eV compared to FeN4 moieties. Thus, the synergistic effect between FeN4 sites and the coordinated pyridine offers new insight in designing outstanding electrocatalysts for multiple applications.",Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.032
Regulated coordination environment of Ni single atom catalyst toward high-efficiency oxygen electrocatalysis for rechargeable Zinc-air batteries,"© 2020Single atom catalysts (SACs) are emerging as a highly promising catalyst category in oxygen electrocatalysis; however, their real-world implementation in rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) is restricted by the insufficient bifunctional activity. Here, a secondary single-atom regulation strategy is developed to tailor the coordination environment and thus modify the catalytic behaviors of single atom Ni catalysts. Through introducing atomically dispersed Fe moieties, the coordination environment of single Ni atom is well regulated with a higher Ni-N/O coordination number due to the long-range electronic penetration interaction, which triggers more optimized adsorption strength between active sites and reaction intermediates. As a result, the obtained Fe, Ni dual atom catalyst (FeNi-SAs@NC) requires only 298 mV overpotential to deliver 10 mA cm−2 in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis outperforming the benchmarking IrO2 (313 mV), Fe-SAs@NC (335 mV) and Ni-SAs@NC (356 mV) electrocatalysts. Moreover, FeNi-SAs@NC performs superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity to the single-atom counterparts and Pt/C benchmark. The practical application of the FeNi-SAs@NC is further validated by a higher ZAB performance (260 mW cm−2 vs 71 mW cm−2 for Pt/C-IrO2), improved long-term durability (100 h at 20 mA cm−2) and encouraging performance in all-solid-sate ZABs (70 mW cm−2).",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2020.12.006
"O-, N-Coordinated single Mn atoms accelerating polysulfides transformation in lithium-sulfur batteries","© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Desired to improve the capacity and cycle stability of lithium sulfur batteries, it is urgent to solve the insulating nature of sulfur cathode, sluggish electrochemical kinetics, and severe shuttle effect associated with polysulfide intermediates. Here single manganese (Mn) atoms implanted in oxygen and nitrogen double-doped hollow carbon sphere frameworks (Mn/C-(N, O)) are prepared as electrocatalyst and anchoring sites for lithium sulfur batteries. O, N-coordinated single Mn atoms can rich in atomic active sites, anchor polysulfides through strong Lewis acid-base interactions. Meanwhile, Mn cofactors show high catalytic activity on the conversion reaction of polysulfides. Moreover, the abundant pores in conductive carbon frameworks can facilitate electrolyte diffusion while simultaneously promote the dynamic protection of the cathode structure during cycling. Consequently, S@Mn/C-(N, O) exhibits an excellent cycling stability with an initial capacity of ~900 mAh g−1 at 1 C with only 0.05% capacity decay per cycle after 1000 cycles. The theoretical simulation results and the enhanced electrochemical performance show the important role of single atom in accelerating polysulfides transformation and suppressing the ""shuttle effect"".",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2020.11.011
Solid phase microwave-assisted fabrication of Fe-doped ZIF-8 for single-atom Fe-N-C electrocatalysts on oxygen reduction,"© 2020 Science PressFe–N–C endowed with inexpensiveness, high activity, and excellent anti-poisoning power have emerged as promising candidate catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Single-atom Fe–N–C electrocatalysts derived from Fe-doped ZIF-8 represent the top-level ORR performance. However, the current fabrication of Fe-doped ZIF-8 relies on heavy consumption of time, energy, cost and organic solvents. Herein, we develop a rapid and solvent-free method to produce Fe-doped ZIF-8 under microwave irradiation, which can be easily amplified in combination with ball-milling. After rational pyrolysis, Fe–N–C catalysts with atomic FeN4 sites well dispersed on the hierarchically porous carbon matrix are obtained, which exhibit exceptional ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.782 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and brilliant methanol tolerance. The assembled direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) endow a peak power density of 61 mW cm−2 and extraordinary stability, highlighting the application perspective of this strategy.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2020.06.046
Molten salt as ultrastrong polar solvent enables the most straightforward pyrolysis towards highly efficient and stable single-atom electrocatalyst,"© 2020 Science PressCurrently, pyrolysis as the most widely used method still has some key issues not well resolved for synthesis of carbon-supported single-atom catalysts (C-SACs), e.g., the sintering of metal atoms at high temperature as well as the high cost and complicated preparations of precursors. In this report, molten salts are demonstrated to be marvellous medium for preparation of C-SACs by pyrolysis of small molecular precursors (ionic liquid). The ultrastrong polarity on one hand establishes robust interaction with precursor and enables better carbonization, resulting in largely enhanced yield. On the other hand, the aggregation of metal atoms is effectively refrained while no nanoparticle or cluster is formed. By this strategy, a C-SAC with atomically dispersed Fe-N4 sites and a high specific area over 2000 m2 g−1 is obtained, which illustrates high ORR activity in both acid and alkaline media. Moreover, this SAC exhibits superior methanol tolerance and stability after acid soaking at 85 °C for 48 h. It is believed that the molten-salts-assisted pyrolysis can be developed into a routine strategy as it not only can largely simply the synthesis of C-SACs, but also can be extended to prepare other types of SACs.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2020.06.021
CO2 reduction by single copper atom supported on g-C3N4 with asymmetrical active sites,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical reduction of CO2 requires catalysts beyond Cu with high activity and selectivity to produce C2 products. Different from many single-atom catalysts that show high performance in obtaining C1 products, Cu supported on carbon nitride (Cu-C3N4) has shown a unique capability to generate C2 products by providing asymmetrical active sites. Herein, we study 17 possible pathways and reaction mechanisms of CO2 reduction toward ethylene – a featured C2 product, on Cu-C3N4. The possible reaction intermediates along with different reaction pathways on three active sites of Cu-C3N4 (Cu, C, and N) were obtained by density functional theory (DFT) computations. The most probable reaction pathway toward C2H4 production is 1.08 eV at open circuit conditions, which is benefited by the synergistic effect of both Cu and C active sites. Comparing with other pathways utilizing Cu/N and C/N active sites, the carbon atom provides a perfect settling centre for the first CO2 after reduction by Cu and leaves Cu vacant for the second CO2 reduction. Our study provides reaction mechanism insights for C2 production on Cu-C3N4 and sheds light on designing electrocatalysts with dual active sites.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.148293

The Activation and Reduction of N2 by Single/Double-Atom Electrocatalysts: A First-Principle Study,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHDeveloping low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is one of the most attractive challenges. In this work, we systematically investigated the catalytic properties of the single atom catalysts (SAC) and the double atom catalysts (DAC) for NRR via First-Principle calculations. The SAC and DAC were formed by single and double transition metal (TM) atoms anchored on N-doped graphene monolayers (TMxN3x-graphene, x=1, 2; TM=Mo, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu). It is shown that both the SAC and the DAC have exhibited high catalytic properties for NRR. Moreover, when N2 is absorbed by its side-on sites, SAC even performs better than DAC. And in five kinds of TM atoms, Fe-complexes exhibit significantly improved catalytic properties. Especially, Fe1N3-graphene has the best catalytic activity for NRR with the lowest free energy change of 0.04 eV in the rate determining step (RDS). This work not only proposes the differences of SAC and DAC but also provides a new kind of single atom catalysts (SAC) for NNR.",ChemistrySelect,10.1002/slct.202100057
Heterogeneous Electrocatalysts for CO2Reduction,"© The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been a fast developing and innovative topic in recent years. It may enable efficient reduction of carbon emission, as well as store renewable electricity into chemical bonds in fuels or other chemicals. However, due to the complexity of reaction factors and mechanisms, the activity and selectivity of CO2RR have yet to be further optimized in order to realize commercial applications. Specifically, the high selectivity of CO2 reduction products (especially for multi-electron-transfer and multicarbon reduction products), lower overpotentials, high energy efficiencies, good stability, and low fabrication cost are required. In this Spotlight, we focus on the design of active sites in heterogeneous catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction, and we provide several strategies to target those challenges in this field. First, as the major side reaction in aqueous solutions, the hydrogen evolution reaction can be inhibited by increasing the energy barrier for H2 formation and tuning the electrolyte diffusion toward the electrocatalyst surface, thus enhancing the Faradaic efficiencies of CO2RR products. Second, the proximity of adjacent catalytic sites suggests a strong capability for tuning the coupling efficiency of multiple carbon atoms. Third, the active sites of heterogeneous electrocatalysts can be generated by different defects, including single-atom doping, anion vacancy, alloy formation, and lattice defects, which can lead to distinctively different production distributions. Finally, a solar-driven electrocatalytic CO2 reduction system was developed, enabling a high solar-to-fuel photoconversion efficiency. Further investigations of heterogeneous electrocatalysts and reaction systems are expected to enhance the electrochemical CO2RR performances toward the application level.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c02648
Boosting electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction performance of two-dimensional Mo porphyrin monolayers: Via turning the coordination environment,"© 2021 the Owner Societies.Designing atomically dispersed metal catalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is an effective approach to achieve better energy conversion efficiencies. In this study, we designed a series of single molybdenum (Mo) atom-anchored porous two-dimensional Mo porphyrin (2D Mo-Pp) monolayers modified by B, C, O, P and S as efficient NRR catalysts to improve the catalytic performance. We introduced two key parameters, θ (pz orbital filling of heteroatoms) and φ (Bader charge of central Mo atoms). It shows that θ and φ play important roles in nitrogen absorption by analyzing the regression models. In particular, the theoretical results suggested that the 2D Mo-Pp monolayer modified by B has an ultralow limiting potential of 0.35 V and can suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, making the 2D Mo-Pp monolayer modified by B a promising NRR electrocatalyst with high efficiency and selectivity. This work provides insights into the rational design of the elaborate structure of single-atom catalysts with tunable electrocatalytic activities.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d0cp06036d
"H4,4,4-graphyne with double Dirac points as high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting","© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.In the light of ultrahigh atom utilization, high catalytic activity and low cost, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been garnering extensive attention in the field of electrochemistry. In recent studies, however, bifunctional SACs for water splitting are rare, and face the challenge of high overpotential. In this work, a series of transition metal (TM) atoms supported on two-dimensional (2D) H4,4,4-graphyne monolayer were verified to be bifunctional SACs for HER/OER and OER/ORR by first-principles calculations. It is interesting that Co@H4,4,4-GY and Pt@H4,4,4-GY could be applied as high-efficiency catalysts for water splitting with low overpotentials of 0.04/0.45 and 0.17/0.69 V for HER/OER, respectively. In addition, Ni@H4,4,4-GY as bifunctional SACs also exhibits desirable catalytic activity for OER/ORR with low overpotentials of 0.34/0.29 V, even superior to commercial IrO2and RuO2. Our results reveal that TM-substrate coordination and local electronic property show significant effects on the catalytic properties for HER/OER/ORR, and the d band center as an effective descriptor could be adopted to optimize the catalytic performance of the catalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta10767k
"Single-atom oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts of Fe, Si, and N co-doped carbon with 3D interconnected mesoporosity","© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.The development of non Pt-based catalysts (non-PBCs) that show excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity for high-performance Zn-air battery (ZAB) and anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) is highly necessitated. Here, the unprecedented single-atom ORR activity of Fe, Si, and N co-doped carbon (FeSiNC) supported on 3D interconnected mesoporous carbons (25 and 50 nm) derived from silica templates is reported. Si moieties connected to a carbon surface were involved in the formation of an atomically distributed FeSixN4−xsite through substitution of Si at the N position in the Fe-N4site, which is the ORR active site of the conventional FeNC. FeSiNC with its larger mesopore (50 nm) exhibits outstanding ORR activity comparable to the most efficient non-Pt-based catalysts and enhanced single-cell performances due to its enhanced mass-transport property. According to theoretical calculations, the ORR activity is originated from not only FeSixN4−xsites located at the basal plane and inter-edge sites, but also C sites adjacent to the Si dopant in both edge and basal regions. Therefore, this study provides a facile strategy toward the rational design of inexpensive and highly active ORR catalysts applicable to single-cell devices.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta11208a

Herein, we develop an axial traction strategy to optimize the electronic structure of the M-N4 moiety and construct atomically dispersed nickel sites coordinated with four nitrogen atoms and one axial oxygen atom, which are embedded within the carbon matrix (Ni-N4-O/C). The Ni-N4-O/C electrocatalyst exhibited excellent CO2RR performance with a maximum CO Faradic efficiency (FE) close to 100 % at −0.9 V. The CO FE could be maintained above 90 % in a wide range of potential window from −0.5 to −1.1 V. The superior CO2RR activity is due to the Ni-N4-O active moiety composed of a Ni-N4 site with an additional oxygen atom that induces an axial traction effect.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202013427
CoP/Ni2P heteronanoparticles integrated with atomic Co/Ni dual sites for enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution,"© 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCTransition metal phosphides (TMPs) have attracted considerable attention as an advanced electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Nevertheless, the catalytic efficiency of single-component TMPs is still restricted that cannot endure long-term running and easy to be corroded especially under harsh conditions. In this work, a multicomponent electrocatalyst combined with CoP/Ni2P heteronanoparticles and Co/Ni single-atom active sites (denoted as N–C@CoP/Ni2P) is rational designed and prepared. The obtained N–C@CoP/Ni2P electrode material exhibits enhanced performance with the overpotential of 153 mV at 10 mA cm−2, and the small Tafel value of 53.01 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, and a satisfied result is obtained in basic media as well. The outstanding HER performance is mainly benefiting from the synergistic effect between CoP and Ni2P, and the highly catalytic faction of atomic Co/Ni dual sites. Furthermore, a powerful conductive network fabricated by N-doped carbon skeleton and in-situ grown CNTs improves the conductivity of catalyst.

Graphene-Based Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction,"© Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.With the excessive exploitation and utilization of conventional fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas, the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has increased significantly, leading to serious greenhouse effect. The electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to liquid fuels and value-added chemicals is one of ideal strategies, considering the atomic economy and artificial carbon circle. Moreover, this process can be driven by renewable energy (solar, wind, tidal power, etc.), thus achieving efficient clean-energy utilization. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) can be carried out under ambient conditions, yielding diverse products such as C1 (carbon monoxide, methane, methanol, formic acid/formate), C2 (ethane, ethanol, ethylene, acetic acid), and C2+ (propyl alcohol, acetone, etc.). However, it faces some challenging problems such as high overpotential on electrodes, the poor selectivity of C2 and C2+ products, the severely competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and the stability in the practice. The rational design and construction of highly active electrocatalysts with low cost, high selectivity, and robust stability are key to these issues. Recently, graphene-based materials have attracted significant attention owing to the following attributes: (1) robust stability in electrochemical environments; (2) tailorable atomic and electronic structures, leading to tuned catalytic activity; (3) adjustable dimensions and hierarchical porous structure, large surface area, and number of active sites; and (4) an excellent conductivity coupled with active, well-defined materials, synergistically enhancing the electrocatalytic activity in the ECR. In this review, recent progress in graphene-based electrocatalysts for ECR is summarized. First, ECR fundamentals, such as reaction routes, products, electrolyzers (e.g., H-cell electrolyzers, flow-cell electrolyzers, and membrane electrode assembly cells), electrolytes (e.g., inorganic electrolytes, organic electrolytes, and solid-state electrolytes), and evaluation parameters of ECR performance (e.g., faradaic efficiency, onset potential, overpotential, current density, Tafel slope, and stability) are briefly introduced. The methods for making graphene-based catalysts for ECR are outlined and discussed in detail, including in situ or post-treatment doping, surface functionalization, microwave-assisted synthesis, chemical vapor deposition, and static self-assembly. The relationships between the graphene structures, including the point/line defects, the surface functional groups (e.g., ―COOH, ―OH, C―O―C, C＝O, C≡O), heteroatom-doping configurations (e.g., pyridinic N, graphitic N, and pyrrolic N, and oxidized pyridinic N), metal single-atom species (e.g., Fe, Zn, Ni, Cu, Co, Sn, Mo, In, Bi), surface/interface properties, and catalytic performance are highlighted, shedding light on the design principles for efficient yet stable carbon-based catalysts for ECR.

Ultrathin Nitrogenated Carbon Nanosheets with Single-Atom Nickel as an Efficient Catalyst for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction,"© Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.The gradual increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is believed to have a profound impact on the global climate and environment. To address this issue, strategies toward effective CO2 conversion have been developed. As one of the most available strategies, the CO2 electrochemical reduction approach is particularly attractive because the required energy can be supplied from renewable sources such as solar energy. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to chemical feedstocks offers a promising strategy for mitigating CO2 emissions from anthropogenic activities; however, a critical challenge for this approach is to develop effective electrocatalysts with ultrahigh activity and selectivity. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a highly efficient and stable atomically isolated nickel catalyst supported by ultrathin nitrogenated carbon nanosheets (Ni-N-C) for CO2 reduction through pyrolysis of Ni-doped metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and dicyandiamide (DCDA). MOFs are crystalline and assembled by metal-containing nodes and organic linkers, which have a large specific surface area, tunable pore size and porosity, and highly dispersed unsaturated metal centers. Thus, Ni-doped MOFs were chosen as the precursors to endow Ni-N-C with a porous carbon structure and nickel ions. The nitrogen in Ni-N-C came from DCDA, which acts as the active site to anchor nickel ions. Because of the porous structure and numerous nitrogen sites, the Ni content of Ni-N-C was as high as 7.77% (w). There were two types of nickel ion-containing structures, including Ni+-N-C and Ni2+-N-C. The structure transformation of the Ni+-N-C species from the initial Ni2+ (Ni-MOF) was achieved by pyrolysis, and the ratio of Ni+ and Ni2+ varied with the pyrolysis temperature. Compared to other Ni-N-C prepared at other temperatures, Ni-N-C-800 contained more Ni+-N-C species that possessed the optimum *CO binding energy and thus boosted the CO desorption and evolution rate, thereby exhibiting higher CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 94.6% at −0.9 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) in 0.1 mol·L−1 KHCO3. In addition, it has been found that the rate of CO formation on the Ni-N-C-800 electrode relies on the electrolyte concentration. With the optimal electrolyte concentration, the Ni-N-C-800 electrode achieved a superior Faraday efficiency of > 90% for CO over a wide potential range of −0.77 to −1.07 V (vs. RHE) and displayed a CO FE as high as 97.9% with a current density of 12.6 mA·cm−2 at −0.77 V (vs. RHE) in 0.5 mol·L−1 KHCO3. After testing at −0.77 V for 12 h, the Ni-N-C-800 electrode maintained a CO FE of approximately 95%, indicating superior long-term stability. We believe that this study will contribute to the design and synthesis of highly catalytically active atomically dispersed monovalent metal sites for metal-N-C catalysts.",Wuli Huaxue Xuebao/ Acta Physico - Chimica Sinica,10.3866/PKU.WHXB202011050
A universal screening strategy for the accelerated design of superior oxygen evolution/reduction electrocatalysts,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Despite advanced computational methods, it is not practical to utilize high-throughput computational screening for a large number of candidates for multi-step reactions due to intercorrelation between reaction intermediates. However, we have devised a universal computational screening strategy that can accelerate the prediction of the theoretical overpotential (ηDFT) for the Oxygen Evolution/Reduction Reaction (OER/ORR) by using only the adsorption free energy of O*. Our accelerated screening strategy can effectively reduce the computing time by skipping the costly calculations of adsorption free energies of OH* and OOH*. Besides, the efficiency of the accelerated screening strategy was verified using 1008 combinations of single-atom-anchored transition metal dichalcogenides. The given candidate materials are rapidly screened using our strategy and finally 32 promising catalysts are found which have a lowerηDFTthan state-of-the-art commercial IrO2for the OER and Pt for the ORR. Our screening strategy that uses a sequential process can narrow down the candidate space, and enables practical high-throughput computational screening of oxygen-involved reactions even for a large number of candidates.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta02425b

Graphene-Based Dual-Metal Sites for Oxygen Reduction Reaction: A Theoretical Study,"© Single-atom catalysts have expanded the design paradigm for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) relying on nonplatinum group metals (non-PGM). Here, density functional theory calculations were performed on a variety of dual-metal active centers, consisting of both PGM (Pt and Pd) and non-PGM (Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) metals, embedded in a monolayer of graphene and coordinated by six pyridinic nitrogen atoms. The dual-metal site stability, OH ligand effect, and electronic structures relevant to ORR were investigated. The ORR reactivities can be depicted in terms of a volcano diagram divided into multiple potential limiting regimes based on a wide range of ΔGOH* values. In addition to OH removal and free molecular O2 protonation as the potential-limiting steps, the protonation of adsorbed O2 and O also emerge as likely potential-limiting steps due to strong O2 adsorptions at certain dual-metal active sites. Among the systems investigated, Fe-Co(OH)s exhibits the highest activity. Moreover, other PGM-free dual-metal sites such as Fe-Fe(OH), Fe-Cu(OH), and Co-Co(OH) also appear to be competitive and would encourage further explorations for Pt-free ORR electrocatalyst alternatives.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c10617
Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets-Immobilized Single-Atom Zn towards Efficient Electroreduction of CO2,"© 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into carbon-containing chemical product is greatly desired for mitigating the air pollution and energy crisis. However, there is great challenge to design highly active and stable electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).

The as-synthesized ZnSA-CN-G nanosheets not only possess abundant single-atom Zn as active sites, but also show unique architectures with high surface area and high electrical conductivity. Consequently, the ZnSA-CN-G nanosheets exhibit high electrocatalytic selectivity for CO2RR, including a high Faradaic efficiency value of 87.1% for the production of CO at -0.5V versus RHE. Moreover, such simple approach can be further applied to synthesize a variety of other single-atom catalysts.",Nano,10.1142/S1793292021500168
Tuning the Selective Adsorption Site of Biomass on Co3O4 by Ir Single Atoms for Electrosynthesis,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe electrosynthesis from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is considered a green strategy to achieve biomass-derived high-value chemicals. As the molecular structure of HMF is relatively complicated, understanding the HMF adsorption/catalysis behavior on electrocatalysts is vital for biomass-based electrosynthesis. The electrocatalysis behavior can be modulated by tuning the adsorption energy of the reactive molecules. In this work, the HMF adsorption behavior on spinel oxide, Co3O4 is discovered. Correspondingly, the adsorption energy of HMF on Co3O4 is successfully tuned by decorating with single-atom Ir. It is observed that compared with bare Co3O4, single-atom-Ir-loaded Co3O4 (Ir-Co3O4) can enhance adsorption with the C-C groups of HMF. The synergetic adsorption can enhance the overall conversion of HMF on electrocatalysts. With the modulated HMF adsorption, the as-designed Ir-Co3O4 exhibits a record performance (with an onset potential of 1.15 VRHE) for the electrosynthesis from HMF.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202007056
Efficient Hydrogen Evolution of Oxidized Ni-N3 Defective Sites for Alkaline Freshwater and Seawater Electrolysis,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHFor mass production of high-purity hydrogen fuel by electrochemical water splitting, seawater electrolysis is an attractive alternative to the traditional freshwater electrolysis due to the abundance and low cost of seawater in nature. However, the undesirable chlorine ion oxidation reactions occurring simultaneously with seawater electrolysis greatly hinder the overall performance of seawater electrolysis. To tackle this problem, electrocatalysts of high activity and selectivity with purposely modulated coordination and an alkaline environment are urgently required. Herein, it is demonstrated that atomically dispersed Ni with triple nitrogen coordination (Ni-N3) can achieve efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in alkaline media. The atomically dispersed Ni electrocatalysts exhibit overpotentials as low as 102 and 139 mV at 10 mA cm–2 in alkaline freshwater and seawater electrolytes, respectively, which compare favorably with those previously reported. They also deliver large current densities beyond 200 mA cm–2 at lower overpotentials than Pt/C, as well as show negligible current attenuation over 14 h. The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) experimental analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the Ni-N3 coordination, which exhibits a lower coordination number than Ni-N4, facilitates water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption, and hence enhances the HER activity.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202003846
Self-Templated Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanorods Embedded with Atomic Fe-N4 Active Sites as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts in Zn-Air Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHIron-nitrogen-carbon materials are being intensively studied as the most promising substitutes for Pt-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A rational design of the morphology and porous structure can promote the accessibility of the active site and the reactants/products transportation, accelerating the reaction kinetics. Herein, 1D porous iron/nitrogen-doped carbon nanorods (Fe/N-CNRs) with a hierarchically micro/mesoporous structure are prepared by pyrolyzing the in situ polymerized pyrrole on the surface of Fe-MIL-88B-derived 1D Fe2O3 nanorods (MIL: Material Institut Lavoisier). The Fe2O3 nanorods not only partially dissolve to generate Fe3+ for initiating polymerization but serve as templates to form the 1D structure during polymerization. Furthermore, the pyrrole coated Fe2O3 nanorod architecture prevents the porous structure from collapsing and protects Fe from aggregation to yield atomic Fe-N4 moieties during carbonization. The obtained Fe/N-CNRs display exceptional ORR activities (E1/2 = 0.90 V) and satisfactory long-term durabilities, exceeding those for Pt/C. Furthermore, the unprecedented Fe/N-CNRs catalytic performance is demonstrated with Zn-air batteries, including a superior maximum power density (181.8 mW cm−2), specific capacity (998.67 W h kg−1), and long-term durability over 100 h. The prominent performance stems from the unique 1D structure, hierarchical pore system, high surface area, and homogeneously dispersed single-atom Fe-N4 moieties.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202008085
Interplay between transition-metal dopants and sulfur vacancies in MoS2 electrocatalyst,"© 2020We investigate the effect of single-atom doping on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of MoS2 using first-principles calculations. In Ru-doped MoS2 that was recently suggested as a promising HER catalyst, we show that sulfur vacancy (VS) prefers to form defect complexes with Ru substituting for Mo (RuMo). We examine hydrogen adsorption free energy at various potential active sites, which underlines that VS in the defect complex can serve as important active centers for HER. We also examine various transition-metal (TM) dopants for MoS2. The results show that several TMs such as Sn, Tc, Ir, Rh, Ru, Re, Os, Pd, and Pt can be used as dopants to promote the HER process on MoS2. By uncovering the active sites for HER in single-atom doped MoS2 as well as suggesting several promising dopants, this work will open the way to developing novel 2D catalysts for HER.",Surface Science,10.1016/j.susc.2020.121759
Atomically dispersed Ni–Ru–P interface sites for high-efficiency pH-universal electrocatalysis of hydrogen evolution,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdDesigning catalysts with specific active sites is a crucial yet challenging task for high-efficiency electrocatalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this paper, we report the construction of atomically dispersed Ni–Ru–P interface sites (ISs) on Ru single-atomic sites doped nickel phosphide nanoparticles (Ru SAs–Ni2P NPs) with high-efficiency HER performances in a wide pH range. Especially, the as-constructed atomically dispersed Ni–Ru–P ISs on 2.20 wt% Ru SAs–Ni2P showed a highly active for catalyzing HER with high turnover frequencies at low overpotential, featuring a high mass activity as well as a superior stability under alkaline conditions. Based on the operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments indicated that the Ni–Ru–P ISs plays an active role in the process of HER and participates in the catalytic process. Density functional theory calculations exhibited that the strong interaction in the atomically dispersed Ni–Ru–P ISs results in an optimized the hydrogen adsorption energy and an elevated hydroxyl adsorption energy, both of which help improve the HER performances. Notably, this work provides a new perspective for the design of high-efficiency HER electrocatalysts by constructing atomically dispersed ISs.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105467
Theoretical investigation of CO2 electroreduction on N (B)-doped graphdiyne mononlayer supported single copper atom,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Carbon dioxide electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR) with proton-electron pair delineates an intriguing prospect for converting CO2 to useful chemicals. However, CO2RR is urgently required low-cost and high efficient electrocatalysts to overcome the sluggish reaction kinetic and ultralow selectivity. Here by means of first-principle computations, the geometric constructions, electronic structures, and CO2RR catalytic performance of boron- and nitrogen-doped graphdiyne anchoring a single Cu atom (Cu@N-doped GDY and Cu@B-doped GDY) were systematically investigated. These eight Cu@doped GDY complexes possess excellent stability. The adsorption free energies showed that the eight Cu@doped GDY could spontaneously capture CO2 molecules. The Cu@N-doped GDY monolayers exhibit a more efficient catalytic performance for CO2 reduction compared to Cu@B-doped GDY because of the differences in adsorption energies and charge transfer. The calculations further indicated that the Cu@Nb-doped GDY complex possesses excellent catalytic character toward CO2RR with the same limiting potentials of −0.65 V for production of HCOOH, CO, OCH2, CH3OH, and CH4. Charge analysis indicated that the *OCHO and *COOH species gain more electrons from Cu@N-doped GDY than from Cu@B-doped GDY complexes due to different electronegativity of coordinated element. Our findings highlighted the electronegativity of coordinated elements for the design of atomic metal catalysts.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.148145
Modulation of Single Atomic Co and Fe Sites on Hollow Carbon Nanospheres as Oxygen Electrodes for Rechargeable Zn–Air Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHEfficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are required for metal air batteries, to replace costly metals, such as Pt and Ir/Ru based compounds, which are typically used as benchmarks for ORR and OER, respectively. Isolated single atomic sites coordinated with nitrogen on carbon supports (M-N-C) have promising performance for replacement of precious metal catalysts. However, most of monometallic M-N-C catalysts demonstrate unsatisfactory bifunctional performance. Herein, a facile way of preparing bimetallic Fe and Co sites entrapped in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe,Co-SA/CS) is explored, drawing on the unique structure and pore characteristics of Zeolitic imidazole frameworks and molecular size of Ferrocene, an Fe containing species. Fe,Co-SA/CS showed an ORR onset potential and half wave potential of 0.96 and 0.86 V, respectively. For OER, (Fe,Co)-SA/CS attained its anodic current density of 10 mA cm–2 at an overpotential of 360 mV. Interestingly, the oxygen electrode activity (ΔE) for (Fe,Co)-SA/CS and commercial Pt/C-RuO2 is calculated to be 0.73 V, exhibiting the bifunctional catalytic activity of (Fe,Co)-SA/CS. (Fe,Co)-SA/CS evidenced desirable specific capacity and cyclic stability than Pt/C-RuO2 mixture when utilized as an air cathode in a homemade Zinc-air battery.",Small Methods,10.1002/smtd.202000751
Rational design of iron single atom anchored on nitrogen doped carbon as a high-performance electrocatalyst for all-solid-state flexible zinc-air batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Developing a cheap and high-efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst is vitally important for high-performance metal-air and full cell batteries. Non-noble iron-nitrogen-carbon materials (Fe-N-C) are reported with outstanding ORR property. However, most of them needs complex acid etching procedure during the fabrication process. Herein, we report a simple route to obtain a cost-effective Fe-N-C electrocatalyst via a facile two-step polymerization-pyrolysis process, and no acid etching is involved. Through a conjunction process of phthalocyanine iron (FePc) with polypyrrole (PPy) and a followed pyrolysis step, atomically evenly dispersed Fe-N-C species on nitrogen doped carbon can be easily obtained. Predictably, the obtained optimal catalyst delivers a half-wave potential of 0.83 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and better stability toward ORR test. Based on the optimal Fe single atomic catalyst as air cathode, an all-solid-state flexible Zn-air battery delivers a high open circuit voltage of 1.42 V, a high energy density of 833 Wh kg−1 and a high power density of 70 mW cm−2. The superior electrochemical energy storage properties demonstrated by the Fe-N-C electrocatalyst show a bright window for reasonable construction of cost-effective non-noble Fe single atom electrocatalysts for next-generation flexible energy storage devices.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2020.125956
Single metal atom anchored on a CN monolayer as an excellent electrocatalyst for the nitrogen reduction reaction,"© the Owner Societies 2021.Based on first-principles calculations, we have studied the behavior of single-atom catalysts formed by a series of single metal atoms (from Ti to Cu) and a CN monolayer in nitrogen reduction reactions (NRRs). It was demonstrated that TM atoms could be anchored on CN and Ti@CN has good electrical conductivity, high stability and good catalytic performance. The onset potential of Ti@CN is as low as −0.38 V through the enzymatic mechanism, which well suppresses the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, the determinate step of Ti@CN for the N2reduction reaction is lower than that of the Ru(0001) stepped surface (−0.98 V). We further examine the effect of coordination on activity and propose a single Ti atom anchored on CN as a promising catalyst with high catalytic capability for N2reduction to NH3. Our work offers a new opportunity and useful guidance for the NRR in an ambient environment.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d0cp05725h
FeS2-anchored transition metal single atoms for highly efficient overall water splitting: a DFT computational screening study,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Hydrogen production from water electrolysis using renewable electricity is widely regarded as a highly promising route to solve the energy crisis of human society. However, the rational design of low-cost electrocatalysts with excellent catalytic activity and long-term durability toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a significant challenge. Herein, we reported a systematic density functional theory (DFT) study on the screening of FeS2-supported transition metal single atoms (M@FeS2) as electrocatalysts for the HER and OER. The results indicate that M@FeS2catalysts exhibit excellent thermal stability and good electrical conductivity for electrochemical reactions. Transition metal atoms are identified as the active sites for the HER and OER. Cr@FeS2and V@FeS2exhibit excellent catalytic activity towards the HER. In particular, Cr@FeS2has a ΔGH*value of 0.049 eV and presents a lower activation energy barrier of 0.22 eV for the HER. The HER activity of Cr@FeS2is even higher than that of the current most efficient Pt catalysts. Mn@FeS2shows good OER activity and is expected to be a promising candidate for OER electrocatalysts. This work could pave a new way to design cost-effective electrocatalysts for the HER and OER, and also shed light on the application of FeS2-based materials in water splitting.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta09903a
Incorporation of nickel single atoms into carbon paper as self-standing electrocatalyst for CO2reduction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The design of selective and efficient catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction is highly desirable yet still challenging, in particular, if the aim is to make them binder-free and self-standing. Here, we report a new and straightforward strategy to incorporate Ni single atoms into a commercially available carbon paper to prepare a self-standing electrode. This is accomplished by consecutive acid activation, adsorption of Ni2+ ions, and pyrolysis steps. Structural characterizations and calculations based on density functional theory consistently suggest that the Ni single atoms are coordinated with three N and one S atoms on the carbon paper. When used for CO2 electroreduction, the electrode exhibits an optimal selectivity (91%), activity (3.4 mA cm-2), and stability (at least 14 h) for CO production in water at an overpotential of 660 mV.

Single copper sites dispersed on defective TiO2-xas a synergistic oxygen reduction reaction catalyst,"© 2021 Author(s).Catalysts containing isolated single atoms have attracted much interest due to their good catalytic behavior, bridging the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Here, we report an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst that consists of atomically dispersed single copper sites confined by defective mixed-phased TiO2-x. This synergistic catalyst was produced by introducing Cu2+ to a metal organic framework (MOF) using the Mannich reaction, occurring between the carbonyl group in Cu(acac)2 and the amino group on the skeleton of the MOF. The embedding of single copper atoms was confirmed by atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. Electronic structure modulation of the single copper sites coupling with oxygen vacancies was further established by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. Significantly enhanced ORR activity and stability were achieved on this special Cu single site. The promising application of this novel electrocatalyst was demonstrated in a prototype Zn-air battery. This strategy of the stabilization of single-atom active sites by optimization of the atomic and electronic structure on a mixed matrix support sheds light on the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.",Journal of Chemical Physics,10.1063/5.0030559
Fe-N-C Electrocatalysts' Durability: Effects of Single Atoms' Mobility and Clustering,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Atomically dispersed (or single atom) iron-nitrogen-carbon (Fe-N-C) catalysts are promising alternatives to platinum group metal nanoparticles supported on dispersed carbon as a cathode material in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. Here, the degradation mechanism of Fe-N-C catalysts, synthesized by the sacrificial support method (SSM), was investigated by conducting accelerated stress tests under the ""load cycling""protocol (i.e. from 0.6 to 1.0 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode). Electrocatalyst activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied for a SSM-derived material, obtained by a single pyrolysis under a 7% H2 atmosphere (Fe-HT1) and juxtaposed to that of a catalyst derived from the same sample, but subjugated to a second pyrolysis under 10% NH3 (noted as Fe-HT2). Several findings can be highlighted: (i) the second pyrolysis results in the skewing of the mesopore size toward higher diameter, along with an increase in iron content and N-pyridinic moieties, leading to a combined benefit in terms of ORR activity and selectivity, (ii) the morphological changes of these catalysts during ageing are drastically different depending on whether they were exposed to a second pyrolysis as, for example, (iii) for Fe-HT2, the formation of Fe-clusters was observed after the load cycling ageing protocol performed at T = 80 °C, along with the partial corrosion of the amorphous domains. No clustering was observed at T = 60 °C concomitantly with a higher ORR mass activity retention providing some guidelines to improve the stability of Fe-N-C materials.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.0c04625
Strong Boron-Carbon Bonding Interaction Drives CO2Reduction to Ethanol over the Boron-Doped Cu(111) Surface: An Insight from the First-Principles Calculations,"© Facile conversion of CO2 into useful multicarbon products is of broad interest in the field of energy storage and controllable carbon emission. However, electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethanol on the Cu(111) surface is limited to the high applied potential and low selectivity. Herein, we demonstrate that the Cu-based electrocatalysts modified by boron (B) single-atom greatly reduce the thermodynamic energy barrier and improve selectivity relative to pristine Cu(111) in the hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol. Electronic structure analysis reveals that the doped B atom, as a charge transfer medium, not only works in supplying electrons to stabilize the intermediates but also undergoes distinct reaction paths compared with pristine Cu(111) to improve the selectivity of ethanol. Moreover, the formation of the robust B-C bond and the unique isomerization step keep the C atoms of the intermediates in an opposite-charged state, which makes C-C coupling facile to generate ethanol. These findings would be very useful to guide the search for a new catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction with high ethanol selectivity based on the abundant Cu-based materials.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c09661
Transition-metal single atoms embedded into defective BC3as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Searching for high-activity, stable and low-cost catalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are of significant importance to the development of renewable energy technologies. By using the computational screening method based on the density functional theory (DFT), we have systematically studied a wide range of transition metal (TM) atoms doped a defective BC3 monolayer (B atom vacancy VB and C atom vacancy VC), denoted as TM@VB and TM@VC (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir and Pt), as efficient single atom catalysts for OER and ORR. The calculated results show that all the considered TM atoms can tightly bind with the defective BC3 monolayers to prevent the atomically dispersed atoms from clustering. The interaction strength between intermediates (HO∗, O∗ and HOO∗) and catalyst govern the catalytic activities of OER and ORR, which has a direct correlation with the d-band center (ϵd) of the TM active site that can be tuned by adjusting TM atoms with various d electron numbers. For TM@VB catalysts, it was found that the best catalyst for OER is Co@VB with an overpotential ηOER of 0.43 V, followed by Rh@VB (ηOER = 0.49 V), while for ORR, Rh@VB exhibits the lowest overpotential ηORR of 0.40 V, followed by Pd@VB (ηORR = 0.45 V). For TM@VC catalysts, the best catalyst for OER is Ni@VC (ηOER = 0.47 V), followed by Pt@VC (ηOER = 0.53 V), and for ORR, Pd@VC exhibits the highest activity with ηORR of 0.45 V. The results suggest that the high activity of the newly predicted well dispersed Rh@VB SAC is comparable to that of noble metal oxide benchmark catalysts for both OER and ORR. Importantly, Rh@VB may remain stable against dissolution at pH = 0 condition. The high energy barrier prevents the isolated Rh atom from clustering and ab initio molecule dynamic simulation (AIMD) result suggests that Rh@VB can remain stable under 300 K, indicating its kinetic stability. Our findings highlight a novel family of efficient and stable SAC based on carbon material, which offer a useful guideline to screen the metal active site for catalyst designation.

Coordination tunes the activity and selectivity of the nitrogen reduction reaction on single-atom iron catalysts: A computational study,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Tuning the electronic structure of a single-atom catalyst (SAC) by controlling its coordination has been recently shown to be a rather promising strategy for further improving its catalytic performance in some electrochemical reactions. Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, the impacts of the coordination structure of an Fe-N-C catalyst on its catalytic activity toward the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) were explored. Our results revealed that the NRR activity on the central Fe atom can be greatly improved by its coordination with a boron (B) dopant. In particular, the computed limiting potential of the NRR on Fe-B2N2 is -0.65 V, which is the lowest among all B doped Fe-N-C catalysts, suggesting its high NRR catalytic activity. Interestingly, the introduction of B coordination can effectively modulate the interaction of the single Fe atom with the N2H∗ species, thus improving its NRR catalytic performance. In addition, Fe-B2N2 exhibits high NRR selectivity by effectively suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) both thermodynamically and kinetically. Therefore, the single Fe catalyst with N and B dual coordination can be utilized as a promising NRR electrocatalyst, which not only highlights the significant effect of local coordination on catalytic activity and selectivity for the NRR, but also provides a new opportunity to further develop more advanced single-atom catalysts for ammonia synthesis.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta09496j
Green Synthesis of a Highly Efficient and Stable Single-Atom Iron Catalyst Anchored on Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanorods for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© The synthesis of inexpensive and efficient electrocatalysts with an excellent stability for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both alkaline and acid media through a facile environment-friendly strategy is extremely desirable but remains challenging. In this study, a single-atom iron electrocatalyst with exclusively Fe-N4 moieties anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon nanorods (denoted as Fe-SA/NCS) is synthesized through a one-step pyrolysis of Fe-doped zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (ZIF8) nanorods that are synthesized in an aqueous system without acid leaching assistance. Profiting from the synergistic effect of the hierarchically porous carbon support with a rodlike structure and the large number of Fe-N4 moieties, the newly prepared Fe-SA/NCS exhibits excellent ORR catalysis activities with a half-wave potential of 0.91 V vs RHE in 0.1 M KOH as well as 0.77 V vs RHE in 0.1 M HClO4. Furthermore, better stability in alkaline or acid conditions was also observed for Fe-SA/NCS compared with Pt/C. The high open-circuit voltage of 1.53 V and high power density of 141.6 mW cm-2 of a zinc-air battery (ZAB) with Fe-SA/NCS as the cathode material indicate excellent electrochemical performances. The ZAB with the Fe-SA/NCS catalysts exhibits a remarkable cycling performance for more than 300 h with a high voltaic efficiency of 78.6%. The present work could pave the way for the rational construction of highly efficient and stable single-atom electrocatalysts through green synthesis for sustainable energy technologies.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c05509
Highly Active Fe/Pt Single-Atom Bifunctional Electrocatalysts on Biomass-Derived Carbon,"© The highly active bimetallic single-atom electrocatalysts are desirable for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) but remain challenging. Herein, Fe/Pt single-atom bifunctional electrocatalysts (Fe1Pt1/NC) are initially fabricated by nitrogen doping during the pyrolysis of porphyra and adsorbed urea at high temperature with subsequent nitrogen anchoring of Pt4+ in aqueous solution with the as-synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon.

Mo2B2MBene-supported single-atom catalysts as bifunctional HER/OER and OER/ORR electrocatalysts,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Searching for highly efficient and cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which can be applied to water splitting, fuel cells and metal-air batteries, is critical for developing clean and renewable energies. Yet it remains a great challenge. By means of first-principles calculations, we have studied the OER, ORR and HER catalytic activity of Mo2B2 MBene-supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) by embedding a series of transition metal atoms in the Mo vacancy (TM@Mo2B2, TM = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) as electrocatalysts. All TM@Mo2B2 SACs show excellent metallic conductivity, which would be favorable for the charge transfer in electrocatalytic reactions. Importantly, Ni@Mo2B2 can be used as a HER/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst with a lower |ΔGH| (-0.09 eV) for the HER under 1/4H coverage and a lower overpotential (ηOER = 0.52 V) than that of IrO2 (ηOER = 0.56 V) for the OER, while Cu@Mo2B2 can be used as an OER/ORR bifunctional electrocatalyst with a lower overpotential (ηOER = 0.31 V) than that of IrO2 (ηOER = 0.56 V) and RuO2 (ηOER = 0.42 V) for the OER and a lower overpotential of 0.34 V than that of Pt (ηORR = 0.45 V) for the ORR, for both of which the transition metal atoms serve as the active sites.

Turning on Zn 4s Electrons in a N2-Zn-B2 Configuration to Stimulate Remarkable ORR Performance,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHA zinc-based single-atom catalyst has been recently explored with distinguished stability, of which the fully occupied Zn2+ 3d10 electronic configuration is Fenton-reaction-inactive, but the catalytic activity is thus inferior. Herein, we report an approach to manipulate the s-band by constructing a B,N co-coordinated Zn-B/N-C catalyst. We confirm both experimentally and theoretically that the unique N2-Zn-B2 configuration is crucial, in which Zn+(3d104s1) can hold enough delocalized electrons to generate suitable binding strength for key reaction intermediates and promote the charge transfer between catalytic surface and ORR reactants. This exclusive effect is not found in the other transition-metal counterparts such as M-B/N-C (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu). Consequently, the as-obtained catalyst demonstrates impressive ORR activity, along with remarkable long-term stability in both alkaline and acid media.

Modulating Single-Atom Palladium Sites with Copper for Enhanced Ambient Ammonia Electrosynthesis,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe electrochemical reduction of N2 to NH3 is emerging as a promising alternative for sustainable and distributed production of NH3. However, the development has been impeded by difficulties in N2 adsorption, protonation of *NN, and inhibition of competing hydrogen evolution. To address the issues, we design a catalyst with diatomic Pd-Cu sites on N-doped carbon by modulation of single-atom Pd sites with Cu. The introduction of Cu not only shifts the partial density of states of Pd toward the Fermi level but also promotes the d-2π* coupling between Pd and adsorbed N2, leading to enhanced chemisorption and activated protonation of N2, and suppressed hydrogen evolution. As a result, the catalyst achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 24.8±0.8 % and a desirable NH3 yield rate of 69.2±2.5 μg h−1 mgcat.−1, far outperforming the individual single-atom Pd catalyst. This work paves a pathway of engineering single-atom-based electrocatalysts for enhanced ammonia electrosynthesis.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202010159

Based on thermodynamic stability and catalytic ORR activity, it is found that CoOxN4-x-SACs show relatively good stability and activity. Furthermore, the final reduction reaction step (OH* + H+ + e- → H2O + *) with the largest ∆G value towards five different CoOxN4-x-SACs is the potential-determining step (PDS). All calculated results suggest that the theoretical overpotential of CoO2N2-opp is munch close to that of Pt (111), implying the optimal electrocatalytic ORR activity among TMOxN4-x-SACs. Furthermore, electronic structure analysis reveals that the d-band center of Co for CoO2N2-opp is located rather far away from the Fermi level (set as zero) and binding states of adsorbed are reduced and the antibinding states of adsorbed OH* fragments are increased, compared with that of other CoOxN4-x-SACs. In conclusion, the introduction of N and O can effectively modify d-band of active metal center and adsorption of oxygen-contained intermediates, thus tune ORR activity.",International Journal of Electrochemical Science,10.20964/2021.09.38

The adsorption strength of the intermediate *OH is a good descriptor for ORR and OER.

Fe-N-C moieties exhibit an optimal performance in the ORR although a synthetic strategy for their production still remains a challenging matter of catalysis and materials science. Herein, an original and general protocol for the preparation of high-density and discrete Fe-N-C-based single-atom catalysts has been proposed starting from cheap and food-grade raw components. The rational combination of chelating citrate ions with the ancillary monodentate thiocyanate (SCN-) ligand has established an ""open gate""for water-soluble iron ions to be accommodated in the form of Fe-N-C moieties within the final C-N networks. Although recent findings in the field of electrocatalysis have pointed out the often beneficial synergistic action between isolated and metallic iron species or iron carbides and their protecting C-N shells, the poor selectivity on the nature of the final Fe species in N-doped C-networks remains a matter of debate and does not shed light on the effective nature of the active species in the process. The highly metal-loaded catalysts in the form of highly dispersed Fe-N-C moieties prepared with the synthetic protocol described in the paper have been tested as electrocatalysts in the ORR, showing electrocatalytic performance under an alkaline environment that ranks among the highest reported so far for related Fe single-atom catalysts (Fe-SACs) of the state-of-the-art.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.1c01638
Theoretical Inspection of M1/PMA Single-Atom Electrocatalyst: Ultra-High Performance for Water Splitting (HER/OER) and Oxygen Reduction Reactions (OER),"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyDeveloping a cost-effective and highly efficient electrocatalyst with superior catalytic activity is crucial for clean and green water splitting, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The single-atom catalyst (SAC) is a breakthrough in industrial catalysis because of the advantages of maximum metal atom utilization, single active sites, strong metal-support interactions, and great potential to accomplish high catalytic performance and selectivity. Herein, we investigate the electrocatalytic performance of a series of SACs supported on a phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) cluster for the HER, OER, and ORR by using first-principles-based calculations. It has been found that the most plausible binding site for the single-metal adatoms is the 4-fold hollow (4H) site over the PMA cluster. Due to the higher stability and catalytic activity of single-metal adatoms, fast electron transfer kinetics is permissible through catalysis. Mainly, Pt1/PMA, Ru1/PMA, V1/PMA, and Ti1/PMA realized decent catalytic performance toward the HER due to nearly ideal (ΔGH*= 0) ΔGH*values via the Volmer-Heyrovsky pathway. The Co1/PMA (0.45 V) and Pt1/PMA (0.49 V) can be active and selective catalysts for the OER with their overpotentials comparable those of to MoC2, IrO2, and RuO2. Among the considered candidates, a non-noble metal Fe1/PMA SAC is a promising electrocatalyst for the ORR with an overpotential of 0.42 V, which is lower than that for the most favorable Pt (0.45 V) catalyst. Furthermore, Pt1/PMA is an auspicious multifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting (−0.02 V for the HER and 0.49 V for the OER) and a metal-air battery (0.79 V for the ORR) catalyst. The current study is further extended to calculate the kinetic potential energy barrier for the excellent catalytic performance of Co1for the OER and Fe1for the ORR. The results suggest that the kinetic activation barrier values in all proton-coupled electron transfer steps are in good agreement with the thermodynamic results. It was revealed that the PMA cluster is a promising single-atom support for the HER, OER, and ORR and provides low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalytic activity under normal reaction conditions.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.1c01294
Machine-Learning-Accelerated Catalytic Activity Predictions of Transition Metal Phthalocyanine Dual-Metal-Site Catalysts for CO2Reduction,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyThe highly active and selective carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) can generate valuable products such as fuels and chemicals and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) and dual-metal-sites catalysts (DMSCs) with high activity and selectivity are superior electrocatalysts for the CO2RR as they have higher active site utilization and lower cost than traditional noble metals. Herein, we explore a rational and creative density-functional-theory-based, machine-learning-accelerated (DFT-ML) method to investigate the CO2RR catalytic activity of hundreds of transition metal phthalocyanine (Pc) DMSCs. The gradient boosting regression (GBR) algorithm is verified to be the most desirable ML model and is used to construct catalytic activity prediction, with a root-mean-square error of only 0.08 eV. The results of ML prediction demonstrate Ag-MoPc as a promising CO2RR electrocatalyst with the limiting potential of only −0.33 V. The DFT-ML hybrid scheme accelerates the efficiency 6.87 times, while the prediction error is only 0.02 V, and it sheds light on the path to accelerate the rational design of efficient catalysts for energy conversion and conservation.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c01526
Morphology and structure controls of single-atom fe–n–c catalysts synthesized using fepc powders as the precursor,"© 2021 by the authors. Li-censee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Understanding the origin of the high electrocatalytic activity of Fe–N–C electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction is critical but still challenging for developing efficient sustainable nonprecious metal catalysts used in fuel cells. Although there are plenty of papers concerning the morphology on the surface Fe–N–C catalysts, there is very little work discussing how temperature and pressure control the growth of nanoparticles. In our lab, a unique organic vapor deposition technology was developed to investigate the effect of the temperature and pressure on catalysts. The results indicated that synthesized catalysts exhibited three kinds of morphology—nanorods, nanofibers, and nanogranules—corresponding to different synthesis processes. The growth of the crystal is the root cause of the difference in the surface morphology of the catalyst, which can reasonably explain the effect of the temperature and pressure. The oxygen reduction reaction current densities of the different catalysts at potential 0.88 V increased in the following order: FePc (1.04 mA/cm2) < Pt/C catalyst (1.54 mA/cm2) ≈ Fe–N–C-f catalyst (1.64 mA/cm2) < Fe–N–C-g catalyst (2.12 mA/cm2) < Fe–N–C-r catalyst (2.35 mA/cm2). By changing the morphology of the catalyst surface, this study proved that the higher performance of the catalysts can be obtained.",Processes,10.3390/pr9010109
"Ultrasonic Plasma Engineering Toward Facile Synthesis of Single-Atom M-N4/N-Doped Carbon (M = Fe, Co) as Superior Oxygen Electrocatalyst in Rechargeable Zinc–Air Batteries","© 2021, The Author(s).As bifunctional oxygen evolution/reduction electrocatalysts, transition-metal-based single-atom-doped nitrogen–carbon (NC) matrices are promising successors of the corresponding noble-metal-based catalysts, offering the advantages of ultrahigh atom utilization efficiency and surface active energy. However, the fabrication of such matrices (e.g., well-dispersed single-atom-doped M-N4/NCs) often requires numerous steps and tedious processes. Herein, ultrasonic plasma engineering allows direct carbonization in a precursor solution containing metal phthalocyanine and aniline. When combining with the dispersion effect of ultrasonic waves, we successfully fabricated uniform single-atom M-N4 (M = Fe, Co) carbon catalysts with a production rate as high as 10 mg min−1. The Co-N4/NC presented a bifunctional potential drop of ΔE = 0.79 V, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C-Ru/C catalyst (ΔE = 0.88 V) at the same catalyst loading. Theoretical calculations revealed that Co-N4 was the major active site with superior O2 adsorption–desorption mechanisms. In a practical Zn–air battery test, the air electrode coated with Co-N4/NC exhibited a specific capacity (762.8 mAh g−1) and power density (101.62 mW cm−2), exceeding those of Pt/C-Ru/C (700.8 mAh g−1 and 89.16 mW cm−2, respectively) at the same catalyst loading. Moreover, for Co-N4/NC, the potential difference increased from 1.16 to 1.47 V after 100 charge–discharge cycles. The proposed innovative and scalable strategy was concluded to be well suited for the fabrication of single-atom-doped carbons as promising bifunctional oxygen evolution/reduction electrocatalysts for metal–air batteries.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano-Micro Letters,10.1007/s40820-020-00581-4
Theoretical study on a potential oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst: Single Fe atoms supported on graphite carbonitride,"© XXXX American Chemical Society.In recent years, one of the research directions of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) was to exploit efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) instead of precious metals. In this study, on the basis of the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a new type of single-atom ORR electrocatalyst by doping single iron atoms into the N-coordination cavity of the substrate graphite carbonitride (Fe/g-C3N4). The adsorption site and the adsorption energy of all the intermediates, the reaction energy barriers, potential energy surface, and Mulliken charges have been analyzed. The feasible ORR reaction paths and the most favorable ORR reaction mechanism were performed. Our calculation results prove that Fe/g-C3N4 is a potential electrocatalyst toward ORR. This work proposes a novel notion for the development of cathode materials in PEMFCs.",Langmuir,10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c03080
Reconstructing the Coordination Environment of Platinum Single-Atom Active Sites for Boosting Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Exploring highly efficient platinum single-atom (Pt1) catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is desired to greatly reduce the catalysts costs of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Herein, based on a nitrogen-doped active carbon (N-doped Black Pearl, NBP), an atomically dispersed Pt-based electrocatalyst is first prepared via a hydrothermal ethanol reduction method with Pt content of about 5 wt % (Pt1/NBP), and it shows high selectivity for the two-electron oxygen reduction pathway. Through further high-temperature pyrolysis, the coordination environment of these isolated Pt atoms is reconstructed to form uniquely nitrogen-anchored platinum single-atom active sites (Pt1@Pt/NBP) for a highly efficient four-electron oxygen reduction pathway. The obtained Pt1@Pt/NBP catalyst presents excellent ORR performance and stability as well as fast ORR kinetics at a high potential region. As a cathode catalyst of a PEM fuel cell, Pt1@Pt/NBP demonstrates 8.7 times higher mass activity than the commercial Pt/C at a cell voltage of 0.9 V.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.0c03330
Atomic Fe Dispersed Hierarchical Mesoporous Fe-N-C Nanostructures for an Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Due to the scarcity and high cost of precious metals, the hydrogen economy would ultimately rely on non-platinum-group-metal (non-PGM) catalysts. The non-PGM-catalyzed oxygen reduction reaction, which is the bottleneck for the application of hydrogen fuel cells, is challenging because of the limited activity and durability of non-PGM catalysts. A stabilized single-atom catalyst may be a possible solution to this issue. In this work, we employ a coordination-assisted polymerization assembly strategy to synthesize an atomic Fe and N co-doped ordered mesoporous carbon nanosphere (denoted as meso-Fe-N-C). The meso-Fe-N-C possesses a hierarchical structure with a high surface area of 494.7 m2 g-1 as well as a high dispersion of Fe (2.9 wt %) and abundant N (4.4 wt %). With these beneficial structural properties, the meso-Fe-N-C exhibits excellent activity and durability toward the oxygen reduction reaction, outperforming the state-of-the-art Pt/C electrocatalysts.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.0c03496

Here, we design high-density Ir single-atom catalysts supported by CoOx amorphous nanosheets (ANSs) for the OER. Experimental results show that Ir single atoms are anchored by abundant surface-absorbed O in CoOx ANSs. Ir single-atom catalysts possess ultrahigh mass activity that is 160-fold of commercial IrO2. The OER of IrCoOx ANSs reached a record low onset overpotential of less than 30 mV. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that Ir-O-Co pairs directly boosted the OER efficiency and enhanced the Ir stability.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.0c04656
1D metal-dithiolene wires as a new class of bi-functional oxygen reduction and evolution single-atom electrocatalysts,"© 2020 The Author(s)Discovering low-cost, durable and highly active electrocatalysts with reduced use of precious platinum group metals (PGM) as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key step for large-scale adaptation of fuel cells, electrolyzers, and metal-air batteries. Here we explore the stability and reaction mechanisms of synthesized one-dimensional transition metal dithiolene wire (TM-DWs, TM = Cr – Cu, Rh, Ir, Pt, Pd) for the ORR and the OER in acid solution by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our calculations reveal that Co-DW intrinsically exhibits high catalytic activity for bi-functional ORR/OER with low limiting overpotentials (η) of 0.46/0.45 V via four-electron reactions. These low limiting overpotentials arise from modified scaling relations by strengthening the binding free energy of OOH* compared to OH* on TM-DWs, yielding universal minimum ORR/OER overpotentials of η = 0.28/0.22 V, remarkably decreased compared to both metal and oxide surfaces (ηideal = 0.37 V). By applying uni-axial strain, the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates on TM reactive sites can be optimized due to shifts in d-band centers. Our findings provide valuable insight into rational design of non-precious metals based electrocatalysts, and demonstrate a new strategy of tuning adsorptions via uni-axial strain to develop efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts of ORR/OER under optimal conditions.",Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.016
"Partial-Single-Atom, Partial-Nanoparticle Composites Enhance Water Dissociation for Hydrogen Evolution","© 2020 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHThe development of an efficient electrocatalyst toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of significant importance in transforming renewable electricity to pure and clean hydrogen by water splitting. However, the construction of an active electrocatalyst with multiple sites that can promote the dissociation of water molecules still remains a great challenge. Herein, a partial-single-atom, partial-nanoparticle composite consisting of nanosized ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles (NPs) and individual Ru atoms as an energy-efficient HER catalyst in alkaline medium is reported. The formation of this unique composite mainly results from the dispersion of Ru NPs to small-size NPs and single atoms (SAs) on the Fe/N codoped carbon (Fe–N–C) substrate due to the thermodynamic stability. The optimal catalyst exhibits an outstanding HER activity with an ultralow overpotential (9 mV) at 10 mA cm−2 (η10), a high turnover frequency (8.9 H2 s−1 at 50 mV overpotential), and nearly 100% Faraday efficiency, outperforming the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C and other reported HER electrocatalysts in alkaline condition. Both experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the coexistence of Ru NPs and SAs can improve the hydride coupling and water dissociation kinetics, thus synergistically enhancing alkaline hydrogen evolution performance.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.202001881
3D N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon supported single-atom Fe-N-C catalysts with superior performance for oxygen reduction reaction and zinc-air battery,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Single-atom Fe-N-C electrocatalysts have emerged as the most promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst. However, the low Fe loading and inaccessibility of Fe-N-C sites limit the overall ORR activity. Here, we report an efficient single-atom electrocatalyst (Fe-N-C/N-OMC) with Fe-N-C sites embedded in three-dimensional (3D) N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon framework. Fe-N-C/N-OMC shows high half-wave potential, kinetic current density, turnover frequency and mass activity towards ORR in alkaline electrolyte. Experiments and theoretical calculations suggest that the ultra-high ORR activity stems from the boosted intrinsic activity of FeN4 sites by graphitic N dopants, high density of accessible active site generated by high Fe and N loadings and ordered mesoporous carbon structure as well as facilitated mass and electron transport in 3D interconnected pores. Fe-N-C/N-OMC also shows comparable ORR activity to Pt/C in acidic electrolyte. As the cathode for zinc-air battery, Fe-N-C/N-OMC exhibits high open-circuit voltage, high power density and remarkable durability.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119411
General synthesis of single atom electrocatalysts: via a facile condensation-carbonization process,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The general and cost-effective synthesis of single atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) still remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a general synthetic protocol for the synthesis of SAECs via a simple condensation-carbonization process, in which furfural and cyanamide were condensation polymerized in the presence of polystyrene nanospheres and metal ions, followed by a pyrolysis to N-doped carbon nanosheet (NCNS) supported SAECs. Six types of SAECs containing platinum, palladium, gold, nickel, cobalt and iron were synthesized to demonstrate the generality of the synthesis protocol. This methodology affords a facile solution to the trade-off between support conductivity and metal loading of SAECs by optimizing the ratio of carbon/nitrogen precursors, i.e., furfural and cyanamide. The presence of single metal atoms was confirmed by high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements. The three-dimensional distribution of single platinum atoms was vividly revealed by depth profile analysis using a scanning transmission electron microscope. The resulting SAECs showed excellent performance for glycerol electro-oxidation and water splitting in alkaline solutions. Notably, Pt/NCNSs possessed an unprecedent mass-normalized current density of 5.3 A per milligram of platinum, which is 32 times that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculations were conducted to reveal the adsorption behavior of glycerol over the SAECs. Using Ni/NCNSs and Co/NCNSs as anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, we constructed a solar panel powered electrolytic cell for overall water splitting, leading to an overall energy efficiency of 8.8%, which is among the largest solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies reported in the literature.

Operando evidence of Cu+stabilization via a single-atom modifier for CO2electroreduction,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Oxide-derived Cu materials are most commonly used as electrocatalysts for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Previous studies have proved that Cu+ and residual subsurface oxygen species can enhance the CO2RR activity; however the stable presence of Cu+ remains a subject of debate. Here, we design a strategy of single-atom Sn anchored on Cu2O nanosheets to stabilize the key Cu+ species for electroreduction of CO2. Operando synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and statistics analysis distinguish the active Cu+ and reduced Cu+ species, and reveal that the constructed Sn-O-Cu sites with charge transfer can significantly enhance the resistance of copper oxides to reduction. Operando infrared spectroscopy suggests that the survival of Cu+ species on the catalyst surface promotes the adsorption of ∗CO during the CO2RR, leading to the obvious improvement of CO2-to-CO conversion. Our results demonstrate the role of a single-atom-modifier in both stabilizing Cu+ species and enhancing the CO2RR selectivity of oxide-derived Cu catalysts.

Designed Single Atom Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting: 3d Transition Metal Atoms Doped Borophene Nanosheets,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle atom catalysts (SAC) for water splitting hold the promise of producing H2 in a highly efficient and economical way. As the performance of SACs depends on the interaction between the adsorbate atom and supporting substrate, developing more efficient SACs with suitable substrates is of significance. In this work, inspired by the successful fabrications of borophene in experiments, we systematically study the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of a series of 3d transition metal-based SACs supported by various borophene monolayers (BMs=α_sheet, α1_sheet, and β1_sheet borophene), TM/BMs, using density functional theory calculations and kinetic simulations. All of the TM/BMs systems exhibit superior HER performance compared to Pt with close to zero thermoneutral Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) of H adsorption. Furthermore, three Ni-deposited systems, namely, Ni/α_BM, Ni/α1_BM and Ni/β1_BM, were identified to be superior OER catalysts with remarkably reduced overpotentials. Based on these results, Ni/BMs can be expected to serve as stunning bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting. This work provides a guideline for developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.",ChemPhysChem,10.1002/cphc.202000692
Single-atom implanted two-dimensional MOFs as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction,"© the Partner Organisations.The exploration of novel electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices has been extensively studied in recent decades for their specific advantages. Therefore, the design of highly efficient, stable, and noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen-related reactions (OER) is critical but challenging and is still worth improving. Herein, a facile and controllable synthesis strategy for bimetallic electrocatalysts for the OER from a two-dimensional iron-based metal-organic framework (HUST-8, HUST = Huazhong University of Science and Technology) precursor has been reported. The unoccupied porphyrin center has been disposed into the layer structure of HUST-8, which is very facile for the introduction of a second type of metal center via post-modification treatment. Guided by the synthesis strategy, Fe/Ni, Fe/Co, Fe/Zn, Fe/Mn and Fe/Fe species have been fabricated, and their electrocatalytic performance for the OER has been further characterized, among which the Fe/Ni type exhibits the best efficiency and conversion. For Fe/Ni species of HUST-8 (labeled as Ni@HUST-8), in 1 M KOH, the initial potential for OER activity performance is 170 mV (vs. RHE). At 10 mA cm-2, the corresponding overpotential is 240 mV and the Tafel slope is simulated as 60.8 mV dec-1. All of these experimental results of Ni@HUST-8 illustrate its better performance than commercial IrO2. Compared to the MOF parent and other bimetallic species, the higher electrocatalytic performance of Ni@HUST-8 should be ascribed to the special synergistic effect of Fe and Ni centers, which tends to greatly improve the reaction kinetics and charge transfer efficiency, while increasing the activity of the OER and achieving the best catalytic performances. The systematic investigation clearly manifests the important role of the synergistic effect of bimetallic centers in the OER and provides other insight into fabricating tailored electrocatalysts derived from MOF-based templates.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers,10.1039/d0qi00812e
Single atom-doped arsenene as electrocatalyst for reducing nitrogen to ammonia: A DFT study,"© the Owner Societies.Due to the wide application of NH3 in the energy and chemical industry, the rational design of a highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalyst for nitrogen fixation at moderate conditions is highly desirable to meet the increasing demand for sustainable energy production in the modern society. Herein, we have systematically studied the catalytic performance of transition metal (TM) atom (i.e., V, Cr, Fe, Co, Cu, Ru, Pd, Ag, Pt, Au)-doped arsenene nanosheet, a new two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial in VA group, as a heterogeneous catalyst for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). By density functional theory (DFT) calculation and systematic theoretical screening, our study predicts that the systems of V-, Fe-, Co- and Ru-doped arsenene have promising potentials as NRR electrocatalysts with high-loading TM and highly stable adsorption of N2 molecule. Particularly, the V-doped system exhibits two feasible configurations for N2 adsorption and an ultralow overpotential (0.10 V) via the enzymatic pathway, which is very competitive among similar reported electrocatalysts. This theoretical study not only extends the electrocatalyst family for nitrogen fixation, but also further deepens our physical insights into catalytic improvement, which can be expected to guide the rational design of novel NRR catalysts.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d0cp04315j

A complex-sequestered strategy to fabricate Fe single-atom catalyst for efficient oxygen reduction in a broad pH-range,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.A facile complex-sequestered strategy has been proposed to fabricate a cost-effective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst with Fe single-atom dispersed on nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Fe SA/NPCs). The key step for such an approach is the pyrolysis of an iron-agar complex, in which the “complex-sequestration” effect between hydrated iron(III) and agarose functions to prevent the agglomeration of single Fe atoms. the Fe SA/NPCs catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activities with half-wave potentials comparable to those of commercial Pt/C in media of a broad pH-range, which are superior to those of most reported non-precious-metal ORR electrocatalysts. Moreover, the Fe SA/NPCs catalyst has also demonstrated outstanding durability and methanol tolerance. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the improved electron transfer from single Fe atom onto adsorbed *OH species in the rate-determining step could be the major reason for the exceptional ORR performance of Fe SA/NPCs in both acidic and alkaline media.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119270
Stabilizing the OOH∗ intermediate: Via pre-adsorbed surface oxygen of a single Ru atom-bimetallic alloy for ultralow overpotential oxygen generation,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Designing efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts based on single-atom catalysts is a highly promising option for cost-effective alkaline water electrolyzers. However, the instability of the OOH∗ intermediate and high energy barrier for the rate-determining step (RDS) (O∗ to OOH∗) on the pure bimetallic-alloy represent serious challenges. Here, we report atomically dispersed Ru single-atoms on a cobalt-iron bimetallic-alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon (RuSACoFe2/G) as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for the alkaline OER. In-depth X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC-TEM) along with theoretical calculations were employed to validate the isolated Ru sites in the surface-oxygen rich alloy. RuSACoFe2/G displays exceptional intrinsic activity, achieving a record low overpotential of only 180 mV at 10 mA cm-2 with superior durability in alkali media. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations revealed that the isolated Ru sites with pre-adsorbed surface oxygen species on a bimetallic-alloy efficiently stabilize the OOH∗ intermediate and significantly reduce the energy barrier for the RDS, boosting the intrinsic OER activity. Our integrated alkaline electrolyzer demands a low cell voltage of 1.48 V at 10 mA cm-2, suggesting that it has potential for use in practical applications.

Microwave-Induced Structural Engineering and Pt Trapping in 6R-TaS2 for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2020 The Authors. Small published by Wiley-VCH GmbHThe nanoengineering of the structure of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is widely pursued to develop viable catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) alternative to the precious metallic ones. Metallic group-5 TMDs have been demonstrated to be effective catalysts for the HER in acidic media, making affordable real proton exchange membrane water electrolysers. Their key-plus relies on the fact that both their basal planes and edges are catalytically active for the HER. In this work, the 6R phase of TaS2 is “rediscovered” and engineered. A liquid-phase microwave treatment is used to modify the structural properties of the 6R-TaS2 nanoflakes produced by liquid-phase exfoliation. The fragmentation of the nanoflakes and their evolution from monocrystalline to partly polycrystalline structures improve the HER-activity, lowering the overpotential at cathodic current of 10 mA cm−2 from 0.377 to 0.119 V. Furthermore, 6R-TaS2 nanoflakes act as ideal support to firmly trap Pt species, which achieve a mass activity (MA) up 10 000 A gPt−1 at overpotential of 50 mV (20 000 A gPt−1 at overpotentials of 72 mV), representing a 20-fold increase of the MA of Pt measured for the Pt/C reference, and approaching the state-of-the-art of the Pt mass activity.",Small,10.1002/smll.202003372
Theoretical investigations of electrochemical CO2reduction by transition metals anchored on CNTs,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Transition metals supported on nitrogen doped carbon materials are a class of promising electrochemical catalysts toward electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR) that have exhibited excellent catalytic performance. Herein, M-N4 (M = Fe, Co and Ni) coordination structures embedded in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were constructed to explore detailed mechanisms as electrocatalysts for CO2RR via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Nitrogen atoms of coordination structures rather than only single transition metal atoms were demonstrated to be effective active sites toward CO2RR. For two possible pathways of the first step, forming ∗COOH or ∗OCHO, according to the catalytic activity of nitrogen atoms to the H atom, ∗COOH generation was facilitated in terms of kinetics over ∗OCHO in three systems. Meantime, it is suggested that the products of electrochemical CO2RR on the three catalysts are heavily dependent on the interaction of CO and the catalysts. Ni-N4/CNT exhibits a considerable selectivity to CO due to the weak interaction of CO and the substrates with a limiting potential of 1.79 V. On the contrary, CO prefers to remain on Fe-N4/CNT due to the strong binding energy of CO adsorbed on Fe-N4/CNT. Then the CO of the Fe-N4/CNT system undergoes further hydrogenation to produce CH3OH and CH4 at the same limiting potential of 0.68 V, indicating that there is no distinct selectivity in forming CH3OH and CH4. Nevertheless, the limiting potentials of CO, CH3OH and CH4 on Co-N4/CNT are totally different, 0.43 V, 0.56 V and 0.87 V, respectively. In particular, CO2RR to CO on Co-N4/CNT has the lowest potential limit. Thus, Co-N4/CNT has a considerable potential as the catalyst for electrochemical CO2RR. In addition, the catalysts of Ni single atoms, unsaturated coordination with nitrogen atoms, edge-anchored on CNTs were investigated for their activity for the CO2RR. Our comprehensive understanding of M-N4/CNT materials may be instructive and meaningful to design advanced catalysts from nonprecious metals for electrochemical CO2RR.

Herein, it is found that Cu catalysts minimized at the single-atom level can overcome the limitations of bulk materials in NO3RR. A metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) electrocatalyst composed of carbon nanosheets embedding isolated copper atoms coordinated with N, Cu-N-C-800, is synthesized by pyrolysis of a Cu-based metal–organic framework at 800 °C. In comparison with Cu nanoparticles and Cu plate-800, kinetic measurements show that the Cu-N-C-800 electrocatalyst is more active and stable and distinctly suppresses the release of nitrite intermediate into the solution. The combined results of experimental data and density functional theory calculations indicate that Cu bound with N (particularly Cu-N2) is the key to favorable adsorption of NO3− and NO2−. This strong binding is responsible for the enhanced rate of nitrate conversion to the end products of ammonia and nitrogen. These findings highlight the promise of single-atom Cu electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction with desirable performance.",Small,10.1002/smll.202004526
Atomically Dispersed Cobalt Trifunctional Electrocatalysts with Tailored Coordination Environment for Flexible Rechargeable Zn–Air Battery and Self-Driven Water Splitting,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHDesigning multifunctional catalysts with high activity, stability, and low-cost for energy storage and conversion is a significant challenge. Herein, a trifunctional electrocatalyst is synthesized by anchoring individually dispersed Co atoms on N and S codoped hollow carbon spheres (CoSA/N,S-HCS), which exhibits outstanding catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction. When equipped in liquid or flexible solid-state rechargeable Zn–air batteries, CoSA/N,S-HCS endows them with high power and energy density as well as excellent long-term cycling stability, outperforming benchmark batteries based on a commercial Pt/C + RuO2 dual catalyst system. Furthermore, a self-driven water splitting system powered by flexible Zn–air batteries is demonstrated using CoSA/N,S-HCS as the sole catalyst, giving a high H2 evolution rate of 184 mmol h−1. The state-of-art experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal synergistic cooperation between atomically dispersed Co-N4 active sites, nearby electron-donating S dopants, and the unique carbon support to single-atom catalysts (SACs). This work demonstrates a general strategy to design various multifunctional SAC systems with a tailored coordination environment.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202002896
Preferentially Engineering FeN4 Edge Sites onto Graphitic Nanosheets for Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Rechargeable Zn–Air Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle-atom FeN4 sites at the edges of carbon substrates are considered more active for oxygen electrocatalysis than those in plane; however, the conventional high-temperature pyrolysis process does not allow for precisely engineering the location of the active site down to atomic level. Enlightened by theoretical prediction, herein, a self-sacrificed templating approach is developed to obtain edge-enriched FeN4 sites integrated in the highly graphitic nanosheet architecture. The in situ formed Fe clusters are intentionally introduced to catalyze the growth of graphitic carbon, induce porous structure formation, and most importantly, facilitate the preferential anchoring of FeN4 to its close approximation. Due to these attributes, the as-resulted catalyst (denoted as Fe/N-G-SAC) demonstrates unprecedented catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by showing an impressive half-wave potential of 0.89 V for the ORR and a small overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for the OER. Moreover, the Fe/N-G-SAC cathode displays encouraging performance in a rechargeable Zn–air battery prototype with a low charge–discharge voltage gap of 0.78 V and long-term cyclability for over 240 cycles, outperforming the noble metal benchmarks.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202004900
Copper Dimer Anchored in g-CN Monolayer as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction Reaction: A Computational Study,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHElectrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) into value-added energy carriers is of utmost importance due to rising emissions of CO2 and depleting energy resource. The search and design of effective, stable, and low-cost electrocatalysts are crucial but face huge challenges. Here, the potential of copper dimer anchored in g-CN (Cu2@CN) monolayer as electrocatalyst for CO2RR is systematically evaluated by means of density functional theory calculations. The computational results indicate that the Cu2@CN monolayer possesses superior catalytic activity for the conversion of CO2 to HCOOH and C2H4 with low limiting potential (−0.16 and −0.52 V, respectively), outperforming the corresponding single-atom counterpart (Cu@CN). Considering the myriad of unexplored dimers anchored in/on g-CN monolayer and their potential catalytic applications, this work provides a useful guidance for future studies.",Advanced Theory and Simulations,10.1002/adts.202000218
Electron-withdrawing functional ligand promotes CO2 reduction catalysis in single atom catalyst,"© 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) powered by renewable electricity offers an attractive approach to reduce carbon emission and at the same time produce valuable chemicals/fuels. To design efficient CO2 reduction electrocatalyst, it is important to understand the structure-activity relationship. Herein, we design a series of single Co atoms electrocatalysts with well-defined active sites electronic structures, which exhibit outstanding CO2RR activity with controllable selectivity to CO. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation studies show that introducing nitro (amino) ligand next to single Co atom catalytic center with electron-withdrawing (electron-donating) capability favors (hinders) CO2 reduction catalysis. This work provides an in-depth understanding of how functional ligand affects the splitting of transition metal 3d electron orbital, thereby changing the electron transfer from transition metal active site to CO2, which is closely related to the Gibbs free energy of the rate-determining step (CO2+e−+*→*CO2−).",Science China Chemistry,10.1007/s11426-020-9847-9
Alkaline earth metal based single atom catalyst for the highly durable oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdDeveloping nonprecious group single-atom catalyst (SACs) based on alkaline earth metal has been rarely explored. Mg metal hampered the catalytic activity towards ORR due to the strong bonding of active centers with oxygenated group intermediate, whereas N-bonded Mg atoms have optimal bonding strength with intermediate oxygen species by adjusting the p-band center position. The co-ordination environment of Mg-Nx plays very crucial role in exhibiting the excellent catalytic activity towards ORR. We provide very simple MOF free methodology without any post acid treatment or any subsidiary sacrificial metal like Zn. The Mg-N-C catalyst exhibited a half-wave potential of 0.80 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, approaching the recently reported Fe-N-C catalyst. Electrochemical calculation further support the Mg-Nx sites as the origin of ORR via efficient 4-electron transfer pathway in basic medium. Importantly, current density is found to decrease less than 2% in diffusion limited current and loss of activity by only 13% at 0.9 V after 10,000 cycles in alkaline medium which far superior to the durability limit set by the US department of energy and overpasses the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. The charge transfer resistance is the crucial parameter influencing on the ORR activity along with (pyridinic N+ pyrrolic N) content and degree of graphitization. This methodology can be applied to design a variety of other alkaline earth metal based M-N-C electrocatalysts and studied for various applications.",Applied Materials Today,10.1016/j.apmt.2020.100846
Isoelectric Si Heteroatoms as Electron Traps for N2 Fixation and Activation,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHDoping the host materials with either electron-rich heteroatoms or electron-deficient heteroatoms have been applied as a straightforward and main-stream method to modify the electronic structures and boost the electrochemical activity for various reactions, including nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR). As the third type of dopants, isoelectric heteroatoms (exemplified with Si atoms in carbon framework in this work) have been designed as highly efficient active centers for NRR. As the same group element with a different size and electronegativity to carbon support, the isoelectric Si heteroatom (Iso-e Si) creates localized singularities with a lone orbital that can act as an electron trap for pre-adsorbed N2 molecules through coulomb interaction and thus facilitates the following activation process for NRR. Iso-e Si atom thus functions as a special type of metal-free single atom-based electrocatalyst to largely boost the faradaic efficiency of pristine carbon support for NRR by a factor of 12, giving a remarkably high turnover frequency value of 0.52 h−1, comparable to atomically dispersed transition metal-based electrocatalysts.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202005779
Site-specific electrodeposition enables self-terminating growth of atomically dispersed metal catalysts,"© 2020, The Author(s).The growth of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs) remains a great challenge owing to the thermodynamically driven atom aggregation. Here we report a surface-limited electrodeposition technique that uses site-specific substrates for the rapid and room-temperature synthesis of ADMCs. We obtained ADMCs by the underpotential deposition of a non-noble single-atom metal onto the chalcogen atoms of transition metal dichalcogenides and subsequent galvanic displacement with a more-noble single-atom metal. The site-specific electrodeposition enables the formation of energetically favorable metal–support bonds, and then automatically terminates the sequential formation of metallic bonding. The self-terminating effect restricts the metal deposition to the atomic scale. The modulated ADMCs exhibit remarkable activity and stability in the hydrogen evolution reaction compared to state-of-the-art single-atom electrocatalysts. We demonstrate that this methodology could be extended to the synthesis of a variety of ADMCs (Pt, Pd, Rh, Cu, Pb, Bi, and Sn), showing its general scope for functional ADMCs manufacturing in heterogeneous catalysis.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-020-18430-8
Single-Atom In-Doped Subnanometer Pt Nanowires for Simultaneous Hydrogen Generation and Biomass Upgrading,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHReplacing the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a thermodynamically favorable ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is regarded as a promising approach to simultaneously realize energy-saving H2 evolution and high-value chemical production. Herein, the single-atom In-doped subnanometer Pt nanowires (SA In-Pt NWs) as high-performance electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and EOR under universal pH conditions is designed. The SA In-Pt NWs/C can be employed to integrate HER with EOR to avoid the large overpotential caused by sluggish OER, which requires a smaller voltage of 0.62 V to reach 10 mA cm–2 compared with that of water splitting (2.07 V). The reaction also exhibits a high faradaic efficiency of over 93% in upgrading ethanol to valuable acetate in the anodic cell. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the combination of the ultrathin 1D morphology and single-atom In decoration provides the maximum number of active sites and effectively activates Pt atoms for catalysis. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that doped In can effectively promote the HER, while also promoting the conversion of ethanol to acetate. Moreover, through the use of SA In-Pt NWs/C as electrocatalysts, many other alcohols can also be employed as anodic feedstock to achieve coupled electrolysis.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202004310
Probing the active site in single-atom oxygen reduction catalysts via operando X-ray and electrochemical spectroscopy,"© 2020, The Author(s).Nonnoble metal catalysts are low-cost alternatives to Pt for the oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs), which have been studied for various applications in electrocatalytic systems. Among them, transition metal complexes, characterized by a redox-active single-metal-atom with biomimetic ligands, such as pyrolyzed cobalt–nitrogen–carbon (Co–Nx/C), have attracted considerable attention. Therefore, we reported the ORR mechanism of pyrolyzed Vitamin B12 using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy coupled with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, which enables operando monitoring of the oxygen binding site on the metal center. Our results revealed the preferential adsorption of oxygen at the Co2+ center, with end-on coordination forming a Co2+-oxo species. Furthermore, the charge transfer mechanism between the catalyst and reactant enables further Co–O species formation. These experimental findings, corroborated with first-principle calculations, provide insight into metal active-site geometry and structural evolution during ORR, which could be used for developing material design strategies for high-performance electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-020-17975-y
Scalable synthesis of 2D hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne on Zn substrate for high-yield N2 fixation,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdHydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY), as a new rising star of carbon materials family, demonstrates high conjugation, robust chemical stability, and versatility for modification. However, grand challenges, including low production rate, disordered topology, and amorphous structure, greatly hinder its large-scale applications. Herein, we report, for the first time, the scalable synthesis (up to gram-level) of two-dimensional (2D) crystalline HsGDY nanosheets with Zn as a substrate. Moreover, as a metal-free catalyst for electrochemical N2 fixation, 2D HsGDY achieves an ultrahigh yield of 103 μg h−1 mg−1cat. with a potential of −0.2 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is comparable with that of noble metals and single-atom catalysts. Different from the heteroatom active sites in carbon-based catalysts reported before, the inner alkynyl C itself in 2D HsGDY was identified as the active site, which adsorbs and activates N[tbnd]N due to the positive charge and high spin density triggered by the slight O doping in the form of C[dbnd]O at the outer alkynyl C. We believe that this Zn-templated scalable production of high-quality HsGDY paves the way for its large-scale production and provides a new playground for the multiple research fields.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105283
Dynamic evolution and reversibility of single-atom Ni(II) active site in 1T-MoS2 electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution,"© 2020, The Author(s).1T-MoS2 and single-atom modified analogues represent a highly promising class of low-cost catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the role of single atoms, either as active species or promoters, remains vague despite its essentiality toward more efficient HER. In this work, we report the unambiguous identification of Ni single atom as key active sites in the basal plane of 1T-MoS2 (Ni@1T-MoS2) that result in efficient HER performance. The intermediate structure of this Ni active site under catalytic conditions was captured by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, where a reversible metallic Ni species (Ni0) is observed in alkaline conditions whereas Ni remains in its local structure under acidic conditions. These insights provide crucial mechanistic understanding of Ni@1T-MoS2 HER electrocatalysts and suggest that the understanding gained from such in situ studies is necessary toward the development of highly efficient single-atom decorated 1T-MoS2 electrocatalysts.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-020-17904-z
Remarkably enhanced catalytic activity by the synergistic effect of palladium single atoms and palladium–cobalt phosphide nanoparticles,"© 2020For the realization of commercially viable ethanol fuel cells, despite much safer than hydrogen gas, it is necessary to develop stable high-performance catalysts for ethanol electro-oxidation reaction (EOR). Unfortunately, current EOR catalysts are far from the expectation and suffer from fast activity degradation. Here we report palladium-cobalt phosphide (Pd–Co2P) nanoparticles (NPs) with Pd single atoms (PdSAs) anchored on graphene oxide (GO) (denoted as Pd–Co2P–PdSAs@GO). Its EOR mass activity (10,520 mA/mgPd) is remarkably larger than any reported carbon-based precious metal catalysts including the benchmark Pd/C catalyst. To achieve high activity and stability, we systematically designed the catalyst with optimized elements ratio (Pd, Co/Ni/Fe, and P) and pyrolysis temperature together with electrochemical activation. The synergistic effect of charge-transfer between Pd and Co2P coexisting on the PdSAs@GO surface to shift the Pd d-band center promotes the bimetallic catalyst activity. The strong binding of PdSAs@GO with metals and the phosphide ligand stabilized NPs provide long-term durability. In-situ Raman analysis reveals that Co2P plays major roles in eliminating poisoning CO at neighboring Pd sites and retaining the catalytic activity even after 20 h.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105166
Electron-deficient titanium single-atom electrocatalyst for stable and efficient hydrogen production,"© Elsevier LtdTo further improve the hydrogen-based energy system, there is an urgent need to replace precious metal-based hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts, including Pt-based materials, with nonprecious metal catalysts for electrochemical production of hydrogen from water. In this work, we propose a novel titanium-doped molybdenum phosphide (Ti–MoP) catalyst. Ti–MoP exhibits a low overpotential of 81.5 mV at 10 mA·cm−2. In particular, the remarkable improvement in material stability and electrochemical durability allows the catalyst to maintain its initial activity after prolonged exposure to air and shows accelerated electrochemical durability testing under acidic conditions. The experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that the high durability is the result of electronically reduced Mo and P caused by Ti, and the high activity is a result of the optimization of the free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH) of the abnormally high-valence Ti.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105151
Nanocasting SiO2 into metal–organic frameworks imparts dual protection to high-loading Fe single-atom electrocatalysts,"© 2020, The Author(s).Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have sparked broad interest recently while the low metal loading poses a big challenge for further applications. Herein, a dual protection strategy has been developed to give high-content SACs by nanocasting SiO2 into porphyrinic metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). The pyrolysis of SiO2@MOF composite affords single-atom Fe implanted N-doped porous carbon (FeSA–N–C) with high Fe loading (3.46 wt%). The spatial isolation of Fe atoms centered in porphyrin linkers of MOF sets the first protective barrier to inhibit the Fe agglomeration during pyrolysis. The SiO2 in MOF provides additional protection by creating thermally stable FeN4/SiO2 interfaces. Thanks to the high-density FeSA sites, FeSA–N–C demonstrates excellent oxygen reduction performance in both alkaline and acidic medias. Meanwhile, FeSA–N–C also exhibits encouraging performance in proton exchange membrane fuel cell, demonstrating great potential for practical application. More far-reaching, this work grants a general synthetic methodology toward high-content SACs (such as FeSA, CoSA, NiSA).",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-020-16715-6
Selective electroreduction of CO2 to acetone by single copper atoms anchored on N-doped porous carbon,"© 2020, The Author(s).Efficient electroreduction of CO2 to multi-carbon products is a challenging reaction because of the high energy barriers for CO2 activation and C–C coupling, which can be tuned by designing the metal centers and coordination environments of catalysts. Here, we design single atom copper encapsulated on N-doped porous carbon (Cu-SA/NPC) catalysts for reducing CO2 to multi-carbon products. Acetone is identified as the major product with a Faradaic efficiency of 36.7% and a production rate of 336.1 μg h−1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the coordination of Cu with four pyrrole-N atoms is the main active site and reduces the reaction free energies required for CO2 activation and C–C coupling. The energetically favorable pathways for CH3COCH3 production from CO2 reduction are proposed and the origin of selective acetone formation on Cu-SA/NPC is clarified. This work provides insight into the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 to multi-carbon products.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-020-16381-8
Synergistic effect of size-dependent PtZn nanoparticles and zinc single-atom sites for electrochemical ozone production in neutral media,"© 2020Electrochemical ozone production (EOP) via water electrolysis represents an attractive method for the generation of high-purity O3. Herein, the X-PtZn/Zn-N-C electrocatalysts show a strong structural sensitive behavior depends on the size of the PtZn nanoparticles and their EOP activity exhibits a volcano-type dependence for the O3 performance in neutral media. The 7.7-PtZn/Zn-N-C exhibits EOP current efficiency of 4.2%, and shows the prominent performance in the production of gaseous O3 with a value of 1647 ppb at 30 min, which is almost 4-fold compared to 2.2-PtZn/Zn-N-C. Based on the experiments and theoretical calculations, the performance of the EOP process was determined by the nanoparticle size-effect and the synergistic effect between the PtZn nanoparticles and atomically dispersed Zn-N-C. Furthermore, the five-membered cyclic structure of O3 can be stabilized between the PtZn nanoparticle and the Zn-N-C support, indicating that O3 is produced at the interface.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2020.03.066
Tuning lithium-peroxide formation and decomposition routes with single-atom catalysts for lithium–oxygen batteries,"© 2020, The Author(s).Lithium-oxygen batteries with ultrahigh energy density have received considerable attention as of the future energy storage technologies. The development of effective electrocatalysts and a corresponding working mechanism during cycling are critically important for lithium-oxygen batteries. Here, a single cobalt atom electrocatalyst is synthesized for lithium-oxygen batteries by a polymer encapsulation strategy. The isolated moieties of single atom catalysts can effectively regulate the distribution of active sites to form micrometre-sized flower-like lithium peroxide and promote the decomposition of lithium peroxide by a one-electron pathway. The battery with single cobalt atoms can operate with high round-trip efficiency (86.2%) and long-term stability (218 days), which is superior to a commercial 5 wt% platinum/carbon catalyst. We reveal that the synergy between a single atom and the support endows the catalyst with excellent stability and durability. The promising results provide insights into the design of highly efficient catalysts for lithium-oxygen batteries and greatly expand the scope of future investigation.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-020-15712-z
Graphene-cobalt based oxygen electrocatalysts,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Increasing green energy demands and environmental concerns have promoted extensive research on the development of next-generation energy technologies with high efficiency and environmental friendliness.

In the past decade, great effort has been devoted to the development of next-generation oxygen electrocatalysts based on transition metals, among which cobalt-based compounds stand out as one of the most promising candidates for precious metals, as exhibiting highly efficiency, excellent stability, plus low-cost and earth-abundance.

Single Atoms on a Nitrogen-Doped Boron Phosphide Monolayer: A New Promising Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for ORR and OER,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional electrocatalysts have been pursued for decades. Meanwhile, single metal atoms embedded in a two-dimensional material substrate (2D-substrate) have emerged as an outstanding catalyst. Herein, we report on computational ORR/OER efficiencies of a series of single atom catalyst systems, with a nitrogen-doped boron phosphide monolayer (N3-BP) as the 2D-substrate, and with Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt as the single-atom subject (M). In brief, our density functional theory results show that the overpotentials for ORR/OER are low for CoN3-BP, NiN3-BP, and PtN3-BP, with {ηORR ηOER} of {0.36; 0.42 V}, {0.29; 0.44 V}, and {0.32; 0.25 V}, respectively. The relevant attributes such as the chemical stability of the 2D-substrate in the ORR/OER environments, immobilization of the single-atom subject on the 2D-substrate, and mechanisms of the ORR/OER activity and the catalyst recovery on the MN3-BP catalysts were carefully examined. The key to the comparative study is how the electronic states of the reaction center near the Fermi level of the catalytic system match the frontier orbitals of ORR/OER reaction intermediates. In short, our method predicts the ORR/OER catalytic efficiencies of novel catalysts via a single-atom/2D-substrate design strategy.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c13597
Single-atom iron-based electrocatalysts for high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell: Organometallic precursor and pore texture tailoring,"© 2020 American Chemical SocietyThe oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of platinum (Pt)-based catalyst is not satisfactory in high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs) operating with a phosphoric acid-doped polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane because of the low immunity of expensive Pt-based catalysts toward phosphate ions. Therefore, finding inexpensive and phosphate-tolerant ORR electrocatalysts is highly demanded in HT-PEMFCs. It is reported that Fe and N co-functionalized carbon (Fe−N− C) material is highly immune to phosphate anions, which makes it a good candidate for HT-PEMFC. In this work, highly micro- and mesoporous Fe−N−C catalysts are synthesized for the first time via a simple pyrolysis of organometallic ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)−Fe complexes prepared at different weight ratios of iron salt to EDTA. The organometallic EDTA−Fe complex is a complete single precursor for Fe and N as well as C and has never been used for the preparation of Fe−N−C catalysts before. This approach allows for the simultaneous optimization of both structural and functional properties of the Fe−N−C catalysts by simply varying the amount of iron salt, which plays both as an active species and as a template for pore generation. The Fe−N−C catalyst is then further optimized by simply adding silica sol solution to the initial precursor before carbonization followed by ammonia treatment to induce more mesopores and micropores as well as to further increase nitrogen doping, respectively, in the final carbon framework. This results in improved mass transfer and leads to the formation of more efficient ORR active sites. Interestingly, the Fe species are found to be present mainly as single-atom Fe species and also Fe particles over the N-doped carbon support, suggesting that the EDTA−Fe complex is an effective medium for generating atomic distribution of Fe in the carbon framework. The resulting single-atom Fe catalyst has been tested as an ORR electrocatalyst in HT-PEMFC, and the optimized catalyst shows a high peak power density of 260 mW cm−2 and a current density of 1260 mA cm−2 at 0.2 V. The high performance is likely correlated with the highly porous nature, the presence of efficient active sites associated with single-atomic Fe− Nx, and the immunity to phosphate adsorption of the iron nitrogenous catalysts despite extremely harsh fuel cell working environments.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c02111
Scheme for Screening O2Reduction Electrocatalysts: From Pure Metals and Alloys to Single-Atom Catalysts,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Screening catalysts with high performance for the O2 electroreduction reaction (ORR) is urgently needed for the renewable energy technology. A universal descriptor with easily accessible properties is essential for such catalyst design. Herein, we have generalized our descriptor ψ based on the valence and electronegativity of the active centers into ORR. We find that the descriptor ψ is universal in describing the adsorption energies of oxygenates and the reactivity toward ORR on a variety of materials including transition metals, alloys, alloy clusters, and single-atom catalysts (SACs). Our scheme uncovers the role of d-bandwidth in ORR and further demonstrates that the environmental effects of active centers are highly localized across various materials. These findings refine the understanding of the composition, structure, and strain effect on alloys and the N-doping effect on SACs, with which we propose new principles to screen advanced catalysts. Our descriptor provides a deep understanding of ORR on multiple materials and offers an easily accessible strategy for designing active catalysts.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c08344
Tailoring the ruthenium reactive sites on N doped molybdenum carbide nanosheets via the anti-Ostwald ripening as efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.The irreversible sintering of supported ruthenium (Ru) catalyst in the preparation process has seriously affected its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and stability. Herein, ultrathin nitrogen-doped molybdenum carbide nanosheets (N-Mo2C NSs) is used as a versatile support to stabilize Ru single atoms (SAs) sites via the anti-Ostwald ripening. Ru SAs are dispersed into the N-Mo2C NSs matrix via the strong bonding between the Ru atoms and Mo2C NSs regulated by N doping. The atomic isolated Ru SAs are confirmed by spherical aberration correction transmission electron microscopy (AC HAADF-STEM) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements. Ru SAs/N-Mo2C NSs exhibits outstanding HER performance, with a small overpotential of 43 mV at 10 mA/cm2, and robust catalytic stability in 1.0 M KOH. Importantly, Ru SAs/N-Mo2C NSs possesses a higher mass activity of 6.44 A/mgRu than that of 20 wt% Pt/C (0.91 A/mgPt) at the overpotential of 100 mV. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the high HER activity of Ru SAs/N-Mo2C NSs is derived from the synergistically accelerated the dissociation of H2O and the optimized H adsorption strength in Mo-Ru interface. This result provides a new direction for the rational designing monatomic electrocatalysts for HER via support interaction effect.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119236

Herein, we prepare a three-dimensional (3D) sponge assembled by graphene nanocages (SGNCs) in which Ni nanoparticles and Ni single atoms coexist via a facile one-pot self-templating and self-catalytic strategy. Driven by simultaneous atomization and agglomeration under higher temperature, dual active sites of single atoms and nanoparticles are formed on graphene nanocages. Benefiting from the unique 3D porous structure and dual active sites, the SGNCs exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, which affords the current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential of 27 mV. Theoretical calculations reveal that the interaction between single atoms and nanoparticles promotes HER kinetics. The controlled engineering strategy of non-noble metal-based hybrid materials provides prospects for innovative electrocatalyst development.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c03565
Selective Loading of Atomic Platinum on a RuCeOx Support Enables Stable Hydrogen Evolution at High Current Densities,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHHigh-performance electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have an important role to play in the development of renewable energy. Platinum remains the most efficient known HER electrocatalyst. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to maximize Pt utilization in actual practical applications. Herein we demonstrate a facile strategy for synthesizing RuCeOx-supported, selectively loaded, atomic Pt (0.49 wt. %) (denoted Pt/RuCeOx-PA) by photoactivation at ambient temperature and pressure. Through the photoelectron transfer at the Mott-Schottky heterojunction in RuCeOx, Pt atoms became embedded into the RuO2 lattice. The resulting selectively loaded Pt-O-Ru moieties in Pt/RuCeOx-PA give a stronger hydrogen spillover effect than Pt complexes randomly loaded by either chemical activation or thermal activation. As a result, Pt/RuCeOx-PA shows superior HER performance to the materials prepared by random loading and is even better than a commercial Pt/C catalyst with much higher Pt loading (20 wt. %) at high current densities (from 50–600 mA cm−2).",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202009612

However, it is difficult to construct model SACs according to a general synthetic method, and therefore, discerning differences in activity of diverse single-atom catalysts is not straightforward. Herein, a general strategy for synthesis of single-atom metals implanted in N-doped carbon (M1-N-C; M=Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) has been developed starting from multivariate metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). The M1-N-C catalysts, featuring identical chemical environments and supports, provided an ideal platform for differentiating the activity of single-atom metal species. When employed in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, Ni1-N-C exhibited a very high CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 96.8 % that far surpassed Fe1-, Co1- and Cu1-N-C. Remarkably, the best-performer, Ni1-N-C, even demonstrated excellent CO FE at low CO2 pressures, thereby representing a promising opportunity for the direct use of dilute CO2 feedstock.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202008787
Tuning the coordination number of Fe single atoms for the efficient reduction of CO2,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.CO2 electroreduction into valuable products holds great promise for energy supply and environmental remediation but remains a challenge due to the lack of high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, we developed an efficient strategy to prepare highly active Fe single-atom catalysts (Fe-N5/Fe-N6) by tuning the coordination number of Fe with N towards CO2 electroreduction. The faradaic efficiency of CO for Fe-N5 exceeded 90% ranging from -0.35 to -0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) towards CO2 electroreduction. The turnover frequency of CO for Fe-N5 reached 5006 h-1 at -1.05 V vs. RHE, which was 3.8 times that (1324 h-1) of Fe-N6. Besides, CO was generated at an overpotential as low as 50 mV over Fe-N5, smaller than that (90 mV) over Fe-N6. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that Fe-N5 facilitated the adsorption and activation of CO2 to form the ∗COOH intermediate, thus leading to superior selectivity and activity for CO2 electroreduction.

Iron clusters boosted performance in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide conversion,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Metal clusters with exposed atomic interfaces and unique electronic structures have received considerable attention in heterogeneous catalysis. However, their potential application in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) remains very challenging because metal clusters tend to drive the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. In this study, we prepared Fe-cluster sites with positive valence anchored on ordered mesoporous carbon materials for use as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst in carbon dioxide electroreduction. The as-prepared catalyst exhibits high selectivity, with a CO faradaic efficiency of higher than 98% at a low overpotential of 0.37 V, and retains 98.5% of its initial selectivity after 50 h of electrolysis in 0.5 M KHCO3. In addition, the as-prepared catalyst exhibits enhanced selectivity of more than 95% from -0.5 to -0.8 V in 0.1 M KHCO3, has 98.6% CO faradaic efficiency at a low overpotential of 0.49 V, and retains 99% of its initial selectivity after 50 h of electrolysis, thus outperforming state-of-the-art Fe-N-based single-atom catalysts. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the atomic interfaces on the Fe clusters reduce the reaction barrier for the ∗COOH intermediate, thus contributing to the rapid transformation of CO2 molecules and resulting in excellent catalytic performance.

Prediction of Highly Selective Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction at Low Overpotential on a Mo-Doped g-GaN Monolayer,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Identifying efficient electrocatalysts with low overpotential and high selectivity for producing ammonia from nitrogen gas is essential for any future electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR)-based ammonia synthesis. Via density functional theory calculations and the computational hydrogen electrode model, we systematically examine the prospect of using a single-transition-metal (TM)-atom-doped graphene-like GaN (g-GaN) monolayer as an electrocatalyst for artificial nitrogen reduction. Among 15 TMs investigated, the Mo-doped g-GaN (Mo@g-GaN) monolayer is the only electrocatalyst predicted to be feasible for the NRR. The Mo@g-GaN monolayer satisfies all screening criteria considered for activating the inert NN triple bond effectively, including stabilization of the adsorbed (*) NRR intermediate *NNH and destabilization of the *NH2 species. This monolayer also possesses sufficient overall stability. A complete analysis of the likely mechanisms involved in the NRR on this catalyst suggests that the Mo@g-GaN monolayer could exhibit promising NRR catalytic activity. It achieves this via one specific (distal) pathway, which has a very low onset potential of -0.33 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), corresponding to a low overpotential of 0.42 V vs the RHE, defined using the measured equilibrium potential for NRR of 0.09 V vs the RHE. The potential-determining step, conversion of *NH2 to *NH3, also exhibits a surmountable barrier of 0.42 eV, suggesting kinetics will be facile. Finally, the Mo@g-GaN monolayer is predicted to exhibit substantial selectivity (∼31%) toward ammonia synthesis over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. These findings may open a potential route for artificial ammonia synthesis using a single-atom catalyst under ambient conditions.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.0c03140
Development of robust electrocatalysts comprising single-atom sites with designed coordination environments,"© The Author(s) 2020.Single-atom catalysts (SACs), which are composed of singly isolated metal sites and heterogeneous supports, have recently attracted intensive attention as a novel category of electrocatalysts. SACs can not only ultimately reduce the loading amount of noble metals but also exhibit unique reaction activity and selectivity for many reactions. However, the design flexibility of conventional supports of SACs, including nanocarbons and metal oxides, is poor.

Electronic Structure Based Intuitive Design Principle of Single-Atom Catalysts for Efficient Electrolytic Nitrogen Reduction,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHAs an alternative to cost- and energy intensive Haber-Bosch process, the implementation of electrolytic ammonia synthesis from dinitrogen molecule has been a long-sought goal. State-of-the-art electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) face not only activity but also selectivity problem with the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as promising for various reactions as they combine the best of homogenous and heterogenous catalysts. The reason for their high activity compared to their bulk and nanoparticle counterparts are yet to be completely understood. Inspired by the structure of nitrogenase FeMo cofactor, here we studied 13 transition metals anchored on MoS2 monolayer at Mo-top positions, as possible electrolytic NRR catalysts using first-principles methods. Employing the implicit solvation model, we calculated free energy barriers for proton abstraction by N2 molecule in end-on configuration and adsorption free energy of hydrogen on all SACs. Based on these two parameters, Fe, Co, and Ru were found to be the most active and highly selective electrolytic NRR catalysts. Compared with other mechanisms, the limiting potentials (and hence activity) for enzymatic mechanism were found to be higher on these three SACs, with Ru SAC having a very low overpotential of 0.38 V vs SHE. Bader charge transferred from transition metal to N2 molecule and group number of transition metals correlate strongly with the NRR activity and hence emerge as two key descriptors for catalytic activity. These intuitive principles for rational designing of promising alternatives to the currently used bulk Ru(0001) catalyst could accelerate the search for highly efficient and selective SACs for electrolytic NRR.",ChemCatChem,10.1002/cctc.202000902
Stable and selective electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide and the electro-Fenton process on CoSe2polymorph catalysts,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in acidic solution can enable the electro-Fenton process for decentralized environmental remediation, but robust and inexpensive electrocatalysts for the selective two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e- ORR) are lacking. Here, we present a joint computational/experimental study that shows both structural polymorphs of earth-abundant cobalt diselenide (orthorhombic o-CoSe2 and cubic c-CoSe2) are stable against surface oxidation and catalyst leaching due to the weak O∗ binding to Se sites, are highly active and selective for the 2e- ORR, and deliver higher kinetic current densities for H2O2 production than the state-of-the-art noble metal or single-atom catalysts in acidic solution. o-CoSe2 nanowires directly grown on carbon paper electrodes allow for the steady bulk electrosynthesis of H2O2 in 0.05 M H2SO4 with a practically useful accumulated concentration of 547 ppm, the highest among the reported 2e- ORR catalysts in acidic solution. Such efficient and stable H2O2 electrogeneration further enables the effective electro-Fenton process for model organic pollutant degradation.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/d0ee01925a
Self-assembly induced metal ionic-polymer derived Fe-Nx/C nanowire as oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Metal/nitrogen co-doped carbon (M-Nx/C) materials have shown their good catalytic activity for electrochemical/chemical reactions in energy conversion devices and organics synthesis. However, the preparation of M-Nx/C materials usually involves a high-temperature pyrolysis step, it generates not only active M-Nx sites but also inactive metal-based aggregates that restrict their activity. How to prepare the M-Nx/C materials with high density of M-Nx sites and specific nanostructure remains a challenge. Herein, we report a general method of “self-assembly induced metal ionic polymer” for preparing M-Nx/C precursors, which can not only preferentially generate M-Nx sites by inhibiting metal aggregation during pyrolysis, but also produce advanced nanostructure for catalysis. Taking the preparation of Fe-Nx/C as an example, the self-assembled nanosheets of [Fe(CN)6]4−⋅{[C6H4-(NH3)2]2}4+ compounds are used as prefabricated materials, which effectively induce the formation of metal ionic-polymer nanowires and nanoparticles. They are applied to synthesize the Fe-Nx/C nanowires and nanoparticles with single metal atoms, respectively. The Fe-Nx/C nanowires exhibit the excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity with the half-wave potentials of 0.82 and 0.92 V under acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. The proposed strategy can be a general method to prepare the M-Nx/C catalyst precursors with the special morphology and high thermal stability.",Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/j.jcat.2020.08.016
Durable hybrid electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane fuel cells,"© 2020The low durability of carbon-based non-precious metal electrocatalysts hinders their practical applications in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this study, we rationally design a hybrid Pt-Fe-N-C electrocatalyst with unprecedented durability. It consists of abundant Pt and Fe single atoms homogeneously dispersed on the nitrogen-doped carbon support and a small amount of Pt-Fe alloy nanoparticles. A PEMFC with Pt-Fe-N-C as the cathode shows a larger peak power density (0.75 W cm−2) than that with Fe-N-C as the cathode (0.50 W cm−2). The remarkable durability of Pt-Fe-N-C is reflected from no noticeable drop in the half-wave potential after 70000 potential cycles between 0.6 and 1.0 V in the liquid cell, and 80% current retention after 85 h of potential hold at 0.4 V in the fuel cell. This work demonstrates the feasibility of improving the durability of Fe-N-C material via ultra-low Pt doping and makes non-precious metal electrocatalysts be close to achieving commercial metrics.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105192
Isolated Ni single atoms in nitrogen doped ultrathin porous carbon templated from porous g-C3N4 for high-performance CO2 reduction,"© 2020Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value-added products is an effective approach to manage the global carbon balance. However, the lack of effective electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction process is a major obstacle for its development. Currently, constructing atomically dispersed non-precious metal electrocatalysts presents a promising way to build high-performance and cost-effective electrochemical CO2 reduction systems. Herein we demonstrate a novel strategy to realize the anchoring and stabilization of isolated Ni atoms in the nitrogen-doped ultrathin porous carbon nanosheets via a polydopamine-assisted g-C3N4 template method. Benefitting from the abundant atomic Ni sites and ultrahigh specific surface area of porous 2D supports (>1000 m2 g−1), the catalyst exhibits excellent activity for CO2 reduction with particularly high selectivity towards CO, achieving a faradaic efficiency of 96% at −0.86 V (vs. RHE) with a current density of 26.4 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M KHCO3 solution.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105158

Defect engineering for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction to ammonia,"© 2020Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to ammonia (NH3) is considered as a promising alternative for the traditional Haber-Bosch process due to its lower energy consumption under ambient conditions. However, major obstacles still remain in improving the NRR activity and selectivity, mainly arising from the chemical inertness of N2 molecule, the sluggish reaction kinetics, and the competition between hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and NRR. The defect engineering can regulate and modify the local coordination environment of electrocatalysts, which could be considered as effective strategies to promote the intrinsic activity. In this review, recent advances on defect engineering of nanostructured electrocatalysts for NRR, including vacancy, doping, single atom, amorphization and high-index facet, are summarized. Particularly, the strategies of defect engineering, the reaction mechanisms, and the reliable NH3 detection methods, are systematically discussed.

FeMo sub-nanoclusters/single atoms for neutral ammonia electrosynthesis,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdElectrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) has long been regarded as a promising process to generate NH3 under ambient conditions. Therefore, developing cost-effective and high-performance non-noble-metal catalysts for NRR is highly desirable. Inspired by the biological nitrogenase structure, we here designed and synthesized a catalyst with iron-molybdenum sub-nanoclusters and single atoms on porous nitrogen-doped carbon (FeMo/NC). The catalyst features porous structure beneficial to active site exposure and accessibility to electrolyte as well as FeMo sub-nanoclusters and single atoms enabling to activate N2 molecular. In situ near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy tests reveal that during the process from vacuum to nitrogen saturation, N2 was close to, adsorbed on and interacted with Fe and Mo in FeMo/NC. The Fe and Mo through electron transfer play a key role in activating the N2 molecules. Therefore, when tested for NRR, FeMo/NC achieves the maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 11.8 ± 0.8% at −0.25 V and NH3 yield rate of 26.5 ± 0.8 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.3 V in neutral electrolyte. Moreover, the catalyst exhibits ignorable variations in the FE and a slight decrease in current density for 100,000 s. This work develops a non-precious bimetallic electrocatalyst with synergetic effect capability for efficient NH3 production and provides a guideline for the design of efficient and robust catalysts with coexistence of sub-nanoclusters and single atoms.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105078
Hemoglobin-derived Fe-Nx-S species supported by bamboo-shaped carbon nanotubes as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdHerein, we report a facile route to synthesize isolated single iron atoms on nitrogen-sulfur-codoped carbon matrix via a direct pyrolysis process in which hemoglobin, a by-product of the meat industry, was utilized as a precursor for iron, nitrogen and sulfur while bamboo-shaped carbon nanotubes served as a support owing to their excellent conductivity and numerous defects. The resulting metal-nitrogen complexed carbon showed outstanding catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. At an overpotential of 380 mV, the optimal sample yielded a current density of 83.6 mA cm−2, which is 2.5 times that of benchmark IrO2 (32.8 mA cm−2), rendering it as one of the best OER catalysts reported so far. It also showed negligible activity decay in alkaline solutions during long-term durability tests. Control experiments and X-ray absorption fine structure analyses revealed that Fe-Nx species in the samples are the active sites for OER. Further density functional theory calculations indicated that the presence of sulfur in the carbon matrix modified the electronic structures of active species, thereby leading to the superior activity of the sample.",Carbon,10.1016/j.carbon.2020.06.064
Scalable strategy to fabricate single Cu atoms coordinated carbons for efficient electroreduction of CO2 to CO,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdDeveloping efficient, selective, and stable single-atom electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is attractive but still remains a challenging, especially for scalable production with low-cost. Among the non-precious metal single-atom electrocatalysts, Cu single-atom electrocatalysts are rarely explored for the efficient CO2-to-CO conversion. Herein, we reported a facile and scalable strategy to prepare the Cu single-atom catalyst (Cu SAs/NC) with exceptional CO production performances. Atomically dispersed Cu–N4 moieties are unambiguously verified by HAADF-STEM and XANES measurements. The as-prepared Cu SAs/NC catalyst delivers a high CO faradaic efficiency of 92% at −0.7 VRHE as well as the excellent durability over 30 h successive electrolysis. It should be noted that this is one of the rare examples of efficient CO production on Cu single-atom electrocatalyst. Besides, the 20-g + samples can be readily fabricated in one batch and exhibit the almost identical CO2RR performances. Furthermore, the combined experimental and theoretical calculation results identify the genuine active Cu–N4 sites are responsible for the high selectivity and efficiency of CO production. This work provides a novel strategy for scalable single-atom electrocatalysts in stable quality and offers new insights into the efficient CO2-to-CO conversion on Cu single-atom electrocatalyst.",Carbon,10.1016/j.carbon.2020.06.088
A facile synthesis of hierarchically porous carbon derived from serum albumin by a generated-templating method for efficient oxygen reduction reaction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Hierarchically porous carbons (HPCs), with large specific surface area, abundant porous channels and adequate anchor points, act as one type of ideal carbon supports for the preparation of single-atom electrocatalysts. In this study, the blood plasma-derived HPC with an interconnected porous framework is constructed via a generated-template method, with the formation of ZnS nanoparticles from the abundant disulfide bonds (-S-S-) in serum albumin. After the thermal activation with heme-containing molecules (also from the bovine-blood biowaste), the HPC exhibits high-exposure and low-spin-state Fe(ii)-N4 atomic active sites, and thereby presents a superior oxygen reduction reaction activity (the half wave potential of 0.87 V) and excellent stability (a 4 mV negative shift after 3000 potential cycles), even comparable with the benchmark Pt/C.

A general approach for hierarchically porous metal/N/C nanosphere electrocatalysts: Nano-confined pyrolysis of: In situ-formed amorphous metal-ligand complexes,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.A nano-confined pyrolysis approach was developed for constructing highly nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous metal/N/C nanospheres (typically Fe/N/C-HP). Hierarchically porous silica nanospheres (NKM-5) were used as a hard template, and an amorphous Fe/Zn-(MeIm)2 complex was employed as a carbon and nitrogen source. During the pyrolysis process, first, the molten Fe/Zn-(MeIm)2 complex diffused into hierarchically porous tunnels of NKM-5. Secondly, the interface confinement effect of nanopores in NKM-5 could effectively immobilize nitrogen to coordinate with iron atom, prevent the aggregation of Fe-based species and form single-Atom Fe sites. After the silica template was removed, the catalyst exhibited a hierarchically porous structure and uniform spherical morphology. This hierarchically porous structure of Fe/N/C-HP can enhance mass transport/electron transfer and greatly improve the accessibility of Fe/N/C sites. As a result, the Fe/N/C-HP catalyst exhibits excellent oxygen reduction performance with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.90 V in alkaline media and 0.78 V in acidic media. A primary Zn-Air battery with Fe/N/C-HP as the cathode catalyst exhibits a large peak power density of 181 mW cm-2 and discharge stability.

Bifunctional single atom electrocatalysts: Coordination−performance correlations and reaction pathways,"© 2020 American Chemical SocietySingle atom catalysts (SACs) are ideal model systems in catalysis research. Here we employ SACs to address the fundamental catalytic challenge of generating well-defined active metal centers to elucidate their interactions with coordinating atoms, which define their catalytic performance. We introduce a soft-landing molecular strategy for tailored SACs based on metal phthalocyanines (MPcs, M = Ni, Co, Fe) on graphene oxide (GO) layers to generate well-defined model targets for mechanistic studies. The formation of electronic channels through π−π conjugation with the graphene sheets enhances the MPc-GO performance in both oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unravel that the outstanding ORR activity of FePc-GO among the series is due to the high affinity of Fe atoms toward O2 species. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and DFT studies demonstrate that the OER performance of the catalysts relates to thermodynamic or kinetic control at low- or high-potential ranges, respectively. We furthermore provide evidence that the participation of ligating N and C atoms around the metal centers provides a wider selection of active OER sites for both NiPc-GO and CoPc-GO. Our strategy promotes the understanding of coordination−activity relationships of high-performance SACs and their optimization for different processes through tailored combinations of metal centers and suitable ligand environments.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.0c05088
Density functional theory study of single metal atoms embedded into Mbene for electrocatalytic conversion of N2 to NH3,"© 2020 American Chemical SocietyThe central theme in single-atom catalysis is to build strong interactions between the single atoms and the support for stabilization in electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR). Herein, we utilize the well-defined ab initio computations to build up the strong coupling systems between single atoms and transition metal borides (MBene) as the superior electrocatalysts for eNRR. This work addresses a series of transition metal atoms ranging from IVB to VIII subgroups in Mo vacancies of the MBene nanosheet (Mo2B2O2) and carries out a systematic screening of activities and selectivity on the eNRR process. The computational results indicate that Re and Os supported on the defective Mo2B2O2 layer possess a remarkable catalytic activity with relatively low barrier of the potential-determining step (PDS) of 0.29 and 0.32 eV, which are lower than that of the single Ru atom decorated on Mo2CO2 (0.46 eV). The implanted Re and Os atoms selectively promote the eNRR process and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process in the presence of oxygen vacancies. Moreover, the number of d electrons and the horizontal periods in periodic table of the elements of single atoms are proved to be related to the first protonation step of eNRR and the crucial adsorbed species *NNH. Accordingly, the binary descriptor with respect to the number of d electrons and the period is proposed to establish the relationship between the intrinsic atomic properties and catalytic capacity. This work paves the way to the electrocatalytic atomic-level mechanism of novel MBene for the reduction of N2 to NH3 at ambient conditions.",ACS Applied Nano Materials,10.1021/acsanm.0c01922
Robust Active Site Design of Single-Atom Catalysts for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Electrochemical ammonia synthesis forms a key part of sustainable chemical synthesis. Single-atom catalysts have emerged as a promising class of electrocatalysts that could be capable of electrochemically reducing nitrogen into ammonia. The analysis of electrochemical reduction of nitrogen is complicated by multiple mechanistic pathways and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The identified pathways using thermodynamic analysis based on density functional theory calculations is strongly dependent on the choice of the exchange correlation functional. In this work, we provide a computational methodological framework using the single-atom systems as an example material class for ammonia synthesis that is robust toward parameter selection. Applying this to Pt1/g-C3N4, Ru1/g-C3N4, and Fe1/g-C3N4, we generate ensembles of limiting potentials, using the ensemble of functionals collected via Bayesian error estimation functionals, to robustly predict catalytic activity. We then extend this to study the scaling between the nitrogen reduction reaction intermediates and use it to identify NNH∗ as the best descriptor for these relations. In addition, a procedure to investigate selectivity is outlined, and a more robust way to analyze the selectivity-activity trade-off is presented. For this single-atom material class, we find choosing catalysts that lie on the strong binding leg of the activity volcano is worth further exploration. Given the ease of integration of the proposed method with minimal additional computational cost, we believe this should become a routine part of the analysis workflow for multielectron electrochemical reactions.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c06692
Ruthenium single-atom catalysis for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction unveiled by grand canonical density functional theory,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.To substitute the intensive energy-consuming Haber-Bosch process for the industrial production of ammonia, the theoretical exploration of catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) into ammonia is critical to obtain an insightful mechanism and principles for designing electrocatalysts. However, most studies adopted the constant charge model (CCM), although an electrochemical system corresponds to the constant potential model (CPM) in reality. Herein, considering the benchmark of carbon-supported Ru single atom catalysts, we systematically examined the adsorption of eNRR intermediates under the condition of constant electrode potential to obtain the eNRR mechanism and optimal active site based on the grand canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT). The comparison study demonstrated that, during the electrochemical processes, the inherent electrons exchanged, ignored by the CCM, play an important role in the quantitative determination of Gibbs free energy change, particularly at the potential-determining step, leading to the conclusion that the RuN4 motif has a lower limiting potential (-0.66 V) than the RuN3 motif (-1.22 V) in the CPM. Importantly, Ru, a single atom bonded with two carbon atoms and two nitrogen atoms, is identified as the optimal eNRR reaction site with the lowest limiting potential of -0.43 V. This work both accurately describes the practical eNRR process for Ru-based single-atom catalysts from the prospective of electrocatalysis and improves the identification protocol for the theoretical exploration and design of electrocatalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta06672a
Modulation strategies of Cu-based electrocatalysts for efficient nitrogen reduction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted great attention recently for ammonia synthesis at ambient temperature and pressure and exhibits largely reduced energy consumption for ammonia production compared with the traditional Haber-Bosch process. The rational design and optimization of NRR electrocatalysts are critically important for breaking the triple bond between nitrogen atoms and the subsequent formation of the N-H bond. Cu-based materials have recently been developed as promising electrocatalysts by various morphology and electronic structure modulation strategies for efficient NRR thanks to the 3d transition metal structure, low cost, high reserves, and excellent catalytic performance of Cu. To further explore new possibilites in this area, in this review, the rational modulation of Cu-based electrocatalysts is used as a typical example to summarize various design strategies effectively enhancing the ammonia yield and conversion efficiency for the NRR. Following a brief presentation of the reaction mechanism of the NRR, five strategies for altering the structure and properties of Cu-based electrocatalysts, namely morphology modulation, alloy engineering, lattice phase regulation, vacancy engineering and single-atom structure construction, are comprehensively summarized and the relationship between the catalyst modulation and corresponding NRR performance is discussed.

"Rational prediction of multifunctional bilayer single atom catalysts for the hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions","© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Bimetallic atom catalysts (BACs), which can exhibit remarkable catalytic performance compared with single atom catalysts (SACs) due to their higher metal loading and the synergy between two metal atoms, have attracted great attention in research. Herein, by means of density functional theory calculations, novel BACs with a bilayer structure composed of monolayers FeN4 (Fe and nitrogen co-doped graphene) and MN4 (Fe/M, M represents transition metal atoms) as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are investigated. Among these bilayer SACs, a series of highly efficient monofunctional, bifunctional, and even trifunctional electrocatalysts have been screened. For example, the overpotentials for the HER, ORR, and OER can reach -0.02 (Fe/Cu), 0.31 (Fe/Hg), and 0.27 V (Fe/Hf), respectively; Fe/Hf and Ir/Fe can serve as promising bifunctional catalysts for the ORR/OER and HER/OER, respectively and Fe/Rh is considered as an excellent trifunctional catalyst for the HER, OER, and ORR. This work not only provides a new idea for understanding and optimizing the active sites of BACs, but also proposes a new strategy for designing high-performance multifunctional electrocatalysts for fuel cells and metal-air batteries.",Nanoscale,10.1039/d0nr05202g
Defective h-BN sheet embedded atomic metals as highly active and selective electrocatalysts for NH3fabrication: via NO reduction,"© 2020 the Owner Societies.NO electrochemical reduction (NOER) is a promising route for the removal of pollutant NO and the production of ammonia. In this work, by means of first-principles computations, we designed a series of single atom catalysts consisting of atomic transition metals anchored onto defective hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with boron vacancies (TM@h-BN). Among all nine candidates, our results revealed that Cu@h-BN and Ni@h-BN showed excellent NOER performances with relatively low limiting potentials of 0.23 and 0.31 V, respectively, which are comparable to (or even better than) that of the benchmark Pt catalyst (0.25 V). Moreover, Cu@h-BN and Ni@h-BN can significantly inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, suggesting that the promoted ammonia formation is a low-potential and highly selective process.

Well-dispersed Pt nanodots interfaced with Ni(OH)2 on anodized nickel foam for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCHindered by price and scarcity, the exploitation of supported Pt-based electrocatalysts with Pt single atoms or Pt nanoclusters is an alternative way to decrease the dosage of Pt and improve the electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of water splitting. The anodization technology is used to modify the surface of nickel foam (NF) to form the porous NiF2 network structure. Then Pt nanodots interfaced with Ni(OH)2 (Pt/Ni(OH)2) hybrid on the anodized NF has been in-situ synthesized by a simple hydrothermal decomposition method. Results show that Pt nanodots on the substrate have good dispersion with the average size of 3 nm, and the Pt loading is only 0.229 mg cm−2. The prepared electrode exhibits the low overpotentials of 25.9 mV and 211 mV at the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, a small Tafel slope of 37.6 mV dec−1, and the excellent durability for HER. The porous network nanostructure of Pt/Ni(OH)2 hybrid, the large electrochemical surface area, the fast facilitated electron transport capability, and the firm adhesion of Pt nanodots with the anodized NF substrate contribute to the remarkable performance towards HER.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.047
"Three-dimensional entangled and twisted structures of nitrogen doped poly-(1,4-diethynylbenzene) chain combined with cobalt single atom as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst","© 2020 Elsevier B.V.The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been explored extensively for various energy conversion and storage system. Development of metal single atom doped well designed carbon substrates are considered as a new effective strategy to enhance catalytic activity and stability, and focused on as promising air cathode materials for metal-air battery. In this work, we report a novel method to fabricate cobalt (Co) single-atom species supported on porous carbon substrate using poly-(1,4-diethynylbenzene) (PDEB) chain as a new carbon substrate. Nitrogen doped PDEB chain combined with cobalt single-atom (Co-N-PDEB) shows excellent ORR and OER bifunctional catalytic performance with 1.08 V of oxygen electrode activity due to the synergistic effect between unique meso and macroporous carbon matrix with doped Co-N4 moiety.

Single-Step Chemical Vapor Deposition Growth of Platinum Nanocrystal: Monolayer MoS2Dendrite Hybrid Materials for Efficient Electrocatalysis,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has excellent electrocatalytic behavior for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), where the catalysis of 2H phase originates from its edges, defects, and strains. Most synthetic methods to activate the electrochemically inert basal planes with catalytic active metals are completed by sequential steps. However, this is extremely time-consuming and lacks production scalability. Herein, we develop a one-step strategy to achieve efficient electrocatalyst of Pt:MoS2 hybrid utilizing atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition synthesis on a conductive glassy carbon (GC) plate that can be directly employed as the working electrode in the HER. The monolayer thickness ensures decreased interlayer electron hopping and increased efficiency of the charge transfer from the electrode. We tune the domain morphology by controlling the precursor flux to enter kinetic or thermodynamic growth regime, delivering dendritic or triangular shape. The materials chemistry undertaken provides fundamental insights into the instability of Pt as metal substitutional dopants in the MoS2 lattice, and instead the stable configuration observed is with Pt as highly dispersed small nanocrystals and single atoms bound to the MoS2 surface. The Pt functionalization at a reduced loading level modulates the favorable HER pathway and triggers synergies in the cocatalyst, which exhibits an onset potential of 48 mV, a Tafel slope of 46 mV dec-1, and an exchange current density of 110 μA cm-2. The enriched edges and defects of dendrite endow it superiority to the triangle, with regard to the density of catalytic sites and synergistic effects along with electrical resistance. These underpin the positive role of a large dendritic MoS2 monolayer as a Pt scaffold in water electrolysis.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c01923
Size-Dependent Nickel-Based Electrocatalysts for Selective CO2 Reduction,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHClosing the anthropogenic carbon cycle by converting CO2 into reusable chemicals is an attractive solution to mitigate rising concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere. Herein, we prepared Ni metal catalysts ranging in size from single atoms to over 100 nm and distributed them across N-doped carbon substrates which were obtained from converted zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF). The results show variance in CO2 reduction performance with variance in Ni metal size. Ni single atoms demonstrate a superior Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO selectivity (ca. 97 % at −0.8 V vs. RHE), while results for 4.1 nm Ni nanoparticles are slightly lower (ca. 93 %). Further increase the Ni particle size to 37.2 nm allows the H2 evolution reaction (HER) to compete with the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The FE towards CO production decreases to under 30 % and HER efficiency increase to over 70 %. These results show a size-dependent CO2 reduction for various sizes of Ni metal catalysts.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202000318
"Rational design of transition metal single-Atom electrocatalysts: A simulation-based, machine learning-Accelerated study","© The Royal Society of Chemistry.With maximum atom-utilization efficiency, single atom catalysts (SACs) are surging as a new research frontier in catalysis science. However, fabricating SACs and maintaining their thermodynamic stability remain challenging and thus uneconomical, largely due to the lack of fundamental understanding of the formation and stabilization mechanisms of single atoms (SAs). Through systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning algorithms, we present a rational design guidance for the feasibility of transition metal SA formation on a defective carbon surface and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of the resulting SAs. We show that the dispersion of a metal nanoparticle (NP) into a stable array of SAs on a defective carbon surface is governed by the decomposition energy barrier of the NP and the diffusion barrier of SAs on a carbon surface. An intrinsic descriptor that correlates the catalytic activity of a SAC with the topological, bonding, and electronic structures of the SAC and its bonding carbon defect site is revealed. The few-shot machine learning algorithm further enables a 130 000-fold reduction of the time needed to calculate the ORR activity of SACs from DFT, and thus allows us to predict the ORR activity of SACs of all transition metals within an error of 8.33%. The results from this study offer a mechanistic and quantitative guidance for rational selection of transition metal and optimal synthesis conditions to fabricate SACs with desirable electrocatalyst activity in emerging energy applications.

Single-Atom Tungsten-Doped CoP Nanoarrays as a High-Efficiency pH-Universal Catalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are urgently required to produce renewable clean H2 fuel. However, developing low-cost, highly active, stable, and pH-universal HER catalysts remains a big challenge. Here, a facile solution route is carried out to construct single-atom tungsten-doped CoP nanoarrays (W-CoP) from metal organic frameworks, which can be directly used as a binder-free, high-activity, and robust pH-universal electrocatalyst toward HER. The W-CoP shows competitive performance compared with the commercial Pt/C, as confirmed by both systematic experimental results and density functional theory calculation. The single-atom W dopant results in full atom utility and tunes the electronic structure of CoP with better activity. As a further demonstration, the W-CoP catalyst also shows a promising property for seawater hydrogen production, holding good potential for real application.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c04322
Oxygen-reconstituted active species of single-atom cu catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction,"Copyright © 2020 Liu Yang et al. Exclusive Licensee Science and Technology Review Publishing House. Distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0).Identification of an active center of catalysts under realistic working conditions of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) still remains a great challenge and unclear. Herein, we synthesize the Cu single atom embedded on nitrogen-doped graphene-like matrix electrocatalyst (abbreviated as SA-Cu/NG). The results show that SA-Cu/NG possesses a higher ORR capability than 20% Pt/C at alkaline solution while the inferior activity to 20% Pt/C at acidic medium. Based on the experiment and simulation calculation, we identify the atomic structure of Cu-N2C2 in SA-Cu/NG and for the first time unravels that the oxygen-reconstituted Cu-N2C2-O structure is really the active species of alkaline ORR, while the oxygen reconstitution does not happen at acidic medium. The finding of oxygen-reconstituted active species of SA-Cu/NG at alkaline media successfully unveils the bottleneck puzzle of why the performance of ORR catalysts at alkaline solution is better than that at acidic media, which provides new physical insight into the development of new ORR catalysts.",Research,10.34133/2020/7593023
Coexisting Single-Atomic Fe and Ni Sites on Hierarchically Ordered Porous Carbon as a Highly Efficient ORR Electrocatalyst,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe development of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant nonprecious materials is critically important for sustainable large-scale applications of fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Herein, a hetero-single-atom (h-SA) ORR electrocatalyst is presented, which has atomically dispersed Fe and Ni coanchored to a microsized nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon support with unique trimodal-porous structure configured by highly ordered macropores interconnected through mesopores. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra confirm that Fe- and Ni-SAs are affixed to the carbon support via Fe-N4 and Ni-N4 coordination bonds. The resultant Fe/Ni h-SA electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR activity, outperforming SA electrocatalysts with only Fe- or Ni-SAs, and the benchmark Pt/C. The obtained experimental results indicate that the achieved outstanding ORR performance results from the synergetic enhancement induced by the coexisting Fe-N4 and Ni-N4 sites, and the superior mass-transfer capability promoted by the trimodal-porous-structured carbon support.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202004670
Nonprecious Bimetallic Sites Coordinated on N-Doped Carbons with Efficient and Durable Catalytic Activity for Oxygen Reduction,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHDeveloping efficient, inexpensive, and durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is important for the large-scale commercialization of fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Herein, a hierarchically porous bimetallic Fe/Co single-atom-coordinated N-doped carbon (Fe/Co-Nx-C) electrocatalyst for ORR is synthesized from Fe/Co-coordinated polyporphyrin using silica template-assisted and silica-protection synthetic strategies. In the synthesis, first silica nanoparticles-embedded, silica-protected Fe/Co-polyporphyrin is prepared. It is then pyrolyzed and treated with acidic solution. The resulting Fe/Co-Nx-C material has a large specific surface area, large electrochemically active surface area, good conductivity, and catalytically active Fe/Co-Nx sites. The material exhibits a very good electrocatalytic activity for the ORR in alkaline media, with a half-wave potential of 0.86 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is better than that of Pt/C (20 wt%). Furthermore, it shows an outstanding operational stability and durability during the reaction. A zinc–air battery (ZAB) assembled using Fe/Co-Nx-C as an air-cathode electrocatalyst gives a high peak power density (152.0 mW cm−2) and shows a good recovery property. Furthermore, the performance of the battery is better than a corresponding ZAB containing Pt/C as an electrocatalyst. The work also demonstrates a synthetic route to a highly active, stable, and scalable single-atom electrocatalyst for ORR in ZABs.",Small,10.1002/smll.202000742
Enhancing both selectivity and activity of CO2 conversion by breaking scaling relations with bimetallic active sites anchored in covalent organic frameworks,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.The development of catalysts with high activity and selectivity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 could provide renewable energy sources and improved environmental remediation. However, most current electrocatalysts have large energy barriers that lower their activity and selectivity. Here, we designed a class of electrocatalysts with 3d transition bimetallic active sites embedded into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and discovered that they were more efficient than noble metals and single-atom electrocatalysts in CO2 reduction reaction to CO. To facilitate rational design and quick screening of desired catalysts, an intrinsic descriptor was identified for the catalysts, which correlates the catalytic activity with the topological, bonding, and electronic structures. Among the catalysts, Fe/Cu-, Ni/Zn-COFs could be excellent electrocatalysts, with the low overpotential (~0.25 V) while suppressing side reactions. The excellent activity and selectivity of the catalysts stems from their unique bimetallic sites that break the constraint of scaling relations, leading to much more adsorption modes and facilitating intermediates to achieve the ideal states.",Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/j.jcat.2020.07.021
Atomic alkali metal anchoring on graphdiyne as single-atom catalysts for capture and conversion of CO2 to HCOOH,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Carbon dioxide electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR) with proton-electron pair delineates an intriguing prospect for converting CO2 to useful chemicals. Here by means of first-principle computations, the geometric constructions, electronic structures, and CO2RR catalytic performance of graphdiyne with single adsorbed alkali metal atoms (AM@GDY) are systematically investigated. The calculated results validate that the AM@GDY complexes possess excellent stability. The catalytic performance is correlated with the size of alkali metal ions. The adsorption free energies of CO2 on AM@GDY surfaces show that the Li@GDY and Na@GDY can spontaneously capture CO2 molecules. The interactions between *OCHO specie and AM@GDY are stronger than that between *COOH and AM@GDY, which can promote the CO2 reduction to HCOOH. The AM@GDY complexes could efficiently convert CO2 into HCOOH with high-selectivity, and the limiting potentials are −0.56 V on Li@GDY and −0.16 V on Na@GDY monolayers. The present findings not only highlight the importance of AM@GDY for CO2 electroreduction but also indicate that they are potentially single-atom electrocatalysts.",Molecular Catalysis,10.1016/j.mcat.2020.111142
Transition metal-Nx doped graphene as an efficient oxygen reduction reaction catalyst: A theoretical perspective,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Currently, single atomic catalysts have been extensively explored as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for several important energy conversion technologies. We systematically evaluated the catalytic activities of transition metal (Tm) coordinated with N atoms in graphene (TmNx-gra) towards ORR. A series of metals comprising 3d (Fe ~ Ni), 4d (Ru ~ Pd) and 5d (Os ~ Pt) have been employed and systematically investigated their formation energies, bonding energies, adsorption energies of the reaction intermediates and stability characteristics by density functional theory (DFT). The Fukui functional analysis revealed that the Tm atom as active site of TmN4-gra. Excluding OsN4-gra, Eads-OOH and Eads-OH of TmN4-gra have obvious linear relationship:Eads-OOH≈Eads-OH+1. Based on the requirements of relatively stable adsorption of ORR intermediates (O2, O, OH, OOH) and low overpotentials, the theoretical study forecasts that CoN4-gra, RhN4-gra and IrN4-gra are the promising ORR catalysts with the overpotentials are 0.448 V, 0.362 V and 0.339 V, respectively.",Computational and Theoretical Chemistry,10.1016/j.comptc.2020.112945
Single Cu Atoms as Catalysts for Efficient Hydrazine Oxidation Reaction,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe development of cost-effective electrocatalysts is vital for promoting the practical application of hydrazine as a viable energy carrier. However, the catalytic performance of the single-atom Cu catalyst has not been evaluated with regard to the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Herein, single Cu atoms anchored on the surface of the P-doped C3N4 substrate (Cu−SA/PCN) have been synthesized using a simple method that involved pyrolysis and phosphorization. The as-obtained Cu−SA/PCN catalyst is observed to demonstrate a suitable efficiency for the electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation at the anode in an alkaline aqueous solution. Remarkably, the catalyst exhibits an excellent electrolytic activity and strong durability for 30 h. Further, it displays a current density of 100 mA cm−2 at a low applied potential of 0.336 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Therefore, this study provides a strategy to manufacture single atom catalysts for an efficient HzOR in alkaline media.",ChemNanoMat,10.1002/cnma.202000337

The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy validates that the intrinsically active center is composed of a mixture of Cu-N2 and Cu-N4 moieties. The designed catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity with onset (Eonset) and half-wave potential (E1/2) at 0.869 V and 0.779 V respectively, and a smaller Tafel slope of 74 mV decade−1, superior to the commercial Pt/C catalysts.",Radiation Physics and Chemistry,10.1016/j.radphyschem.2019.03.034
Ru single atoms on N‑doped carbon by spatial confinement and ionic substitution strategies for high-performance Li−O2 batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical SocietyNonaqueous rechargeable lithium−oxygen batteries (LOBs) are one of the most promising candidates for future electric vehicles and wearable/flexible electronics. However, their development is severely hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the ORR and OER during the discharge and charge processes. Here, we employ MOF-assisted spatial confinement and ionic substitution strategies to synthesize Ru single atoms riveted with nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Ru SAs-NC) as the electrocatalytic material. By using the optimized Ru0.3 SAs-NC as electrocatalyst in the oxygen-breathing electrodes, the developed LOB can deliver the lowest overpotential of only 0.55 V at 0.02 mA cm−2. Moreover, in-situ DEMS results quantify that the e−/O2 ratio of LOBs in a full cycle is only 2.14, indicating a superior electrocatalytic performance in LOB applications. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru−N4 serves as the driving force center, and the amount of this configuration can significantly affect the internal affinity of intermediate species. The rate-limiting step of the ORR on the catalyst surface is the occurrence of 2e− reactions to generate Li2O2, while that of the OER pathway is the oxidation of Li2O2. This work broadens the field of vision for the design of single-site high-efficiency catalysts with maximum atomic utilization efficiency for LOBs.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.0c07317
Single-atom Co−N4 electrocatalyst enabling four-electron oxygen reduction with enhanced hydrogen peroxide tolerance for selective sensing,"© 2020 American Chemical SocietyElectrocatalysis of the four-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) provides a promising approach for energy conversion, storage, and oxygen monitoring. However, it is always accompanied by the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on most employed catalysts, which brings down the electrocatalytic selectivity. Here, we report a single-atom Co− N4 electrocatalyst for the four-electron ORR at an onset potential of 0.68 V (vs RHE) in neutral media while with high H2O2 tolerance, outperforming commercial Pt electrocatalysts. Electrochemical kinetic analysis confirms that the Co−N4 catalytic sites dominantly promote the direct four-electron pathway of the ORR rather than the two sequential two-electron reduction pathways with H2O2 as the intermediate. Density functional theory calculations reveal that H2O2 reduction is hampered by the weak adsorption of H2O2 on the porphyrin-like Co centers. This endows the electrocatalyst with improved resistance to current interference from H2O2, enabling highly selective O2 sensing as validated by the reliable sensing performance in vivo. Our study demonstrates the intriguing advantage of single-atom catalysts with high capacity for tailoring metal−adsorbate interactions, broadening their applications in environmental and life monitoring.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.0c07790
Transition metal-N4embedded black phosphorus carbide as a high-performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR/OER,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Designing highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an important challenge in energy conversion and storage technology. In this work, based on computational screening over doping of 23 kinds of transition metals (TMs), we use first-principles study to explore the ORR and OER activity of TM-N4 embedded black phosphorus carbide monolayer (b-PC). The results show that its catalytic performance highly depends on the number of electrons in the d orbital and the number of valence electrons of introduced TM atom. Moreover, we found that Co-N4-bPC (ηORR = 0.31 V; ηOER = 0.22 V), Rh-N4-bPC (ηORR = 0.33 V; ηOER = 0.62 V), and Ir-N4-bPC (ηORR = 0.21 V; ηOER = 0.21 V) can be promising candidates as bifunctional catalysts for both the ORR and OER and can be comparable or superior to TM-N4-graphene in terms of overpotential. They experience no structural distortion at 500 K. Moreover, the exfoliation energy of b-PC is lower than that of graphene, and these three promising candidates show much lower formation energy than TM-N4-graphene.

Computational Screening Single-Atom Catalysts Supported on g-CN for N2Reduction: High Activity and Selectivity,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.It remains a great challenge to design efficient electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) with high activity and high selectivity. Herein, density functional theory calculations were performed to examine the feasibility of a single transition metal (TM, from Sc to Au) atom supported on a novel graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) for NRR. It was demonstrated that TM atoms could be anchored on g-CN. With the ""acceptance-donation""interaction, the activation of a N2 molecule was favorably achieved on TM/g-CN. Particularly, five candidates (Nb, Mo, Ta, W, and Re/g-CN) were picked out benefitting from their high NRR activity (limiting potentials of-0.42,-0.39,-0.35,-0.29, and-0.39 V, respectively) and high selectivity (faradic efficiencies of 100, 100, 100, 94, and 69%, respectively). Multiple-level descriptors (ÎGN, ICOHP, and Ï) shed light on the origin of NRR activity from the view of energy, electronic structure, and basic characteristics. The kinetic stability was validated to ensure the feasibility in real experimental conditions.

Chemical design and synthesis of superior single-atom electrocatalystsvia in situpolymerization,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.Molecule-like electrocatalysts with FeN4motifs have been demonstrated to be excellent candidates for various renewable energy conversions. The ability to further tune the electronic properties of molecular FeN4motifs and integrate them onto conductive supports represents a key step towards the synthesis of highly robust and efficient single-atom catalysts (SACs) for practical applications. Here, we developed a new route for the synthesis of a well-defined single-atom FeN4electrocatalystvia in situpolymerization of four amino groups functionalized iron phthalocyanine (NH2-FePc) molecules on conductive carbon nanotubes. The intermolecular oxidative dimerization between the amino groups of NH2-FePc creates the desired electron-withdrawing pyrazine linker between FeN4motifs, which can significantly optimize their electrocatalytic performances. As a result, the FeN4-SAC exhibits both outstanding ORR activity (a half-wave potential of 0.88 Vvs.RHE) and excellent performance in Zn-oxygen batteries, outperforming the commercial Pt/C and pristine iron phthalocyanine (FePc) catalysts. Our theoretical calculations reveal that the presence of electron-withdrawing linkers shifts the occupied antibonding states towards lower energies and thus weakens the Fe-O bond, which is primarily responsible for the enhancement of ORR activity.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta05130f
Graphite Nanoarrays-Confined Fe and Co Single-Atoms within Graphene Sponges as Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalyst for Ultralong Lasting Zinc-Air Battery,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.The inferior stability of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts in the air cathode is one of the main obstacles that impedes the commercialization of zinc-air batteries (ZABs). This work describes a self-assembly technique combined with subsequent calcination to prepare a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst of graphite nanoarrays-confined Fe and Co single-atoms within graphene sponges (FeCo-NGS). Specifically, graphene sponges overspread with graphite nanoarrays as a structure regulation, which can prevent the metal single-atoms from aggregating and accelerate the mass/electron transfer, provides a guarantee for the long-term operation. Furthermore, M-N4 (M = Fe/Co) as the intrinsic activity regulation can effectively drive the heterogeneous oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic processes. Thanks to the rationally designed regulations, FeCo-NGS shows both extraordinary electrocatalytic activity for ORR and OER, even outperforming commercial Pt/C and IrO2. Remarkably, ZABs with FeCo-NGS air cathode demonstrate a record-breaking cycle lifetime of more than 1500 h (over 9000 cycles) at 10 mA cm-2 with a small charge-discharge gap.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c12801
Atomistic Insights into the Stability of Pt Single-Atom Electrocatalysts,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have quickly emerged as a new class of catalytic materials. When confronted with classical carbon-supported nanoparticulated catalysts (Pt/C), SACs are often claimed to have superior electrocatalytic properties, e.g., stability. In this study, we critically assess this statement by investigating S-doped carbon-supported Pt SACs as a representative example of noble-metal-based SACs. We use a set of complementary techniques, which includes online inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (online ICP-MS), identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is shown by online ICP-MS that the dissolution behavior of as-synthesized Pt SACs is significantly different from that of metallic Pt/C. Moreover, Pt SACs are, indeed, confirmed to be more stable toward Pt dissolution. When cycled to potentials of up to 1.5 VRHE, however, the dissolution profiles of Pt SACs and Pt/C become similar. IL-TEM and XPS show that this transition is due to morphological and chemical changes caused by cycling. The latter, in turn, is a consequence of the relatively poor stability of S ligands. As monitored by online ICP-MS and XPS, significant amounts of sulfur leave the catalyst during oxidation. Hence, in case catalysts with improved stability in the anodic potential region are desired, more robust supports and ligands must be developed.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.0c07138
The rational design of single-atom catalysts for electrochemical ammonia synthesis: Via a descriptor-based approach,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely studied in electrocatalysis towards renewable energy conversion. Herein, we present a general descriptor-based strategy for the rational design of SACs via density functional theory calculations. Taking the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) as an example, we firstly revealed the scaling relations for adsorption energies of intermediates on a series of 4-B (MB4), 4-C (MC4) and 4-N (MN4) coordinated SACs. Based on this, the activity of the NRR was described by the adsorption free energy of ∗NH. It's found that MB4, MC4 and MN4 followed the same volcano curve of activity, where FeB4 was optimal with a limiting potential of -0.55 V. On MB4, the H adsorption energies were weaker than on widely studied MC4 and MN4 due to the highly occupied H 1s-d antibonding state, which resulted in a higher NRR selectivity of MB4. More strikingly, kinetic calculations suggested that the activation energy of the NRR (0.99 eV) is lower than that of the HER (1.10 eV) on FeB4 at 0 V vs. RHE, and hence the ammonia production should be more feasible than hydrogen evolution on FeB4. This work not only reported MB4 as a potential NRR electrocatalyst, where FeB4 was the most outstanding, but also generalized the descriptor-based approach to the rational design of widely studied SACs.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta05943a
"Controlled chelation between tannic acid and Fe precursors to obtain N, S co-doped carbon with high density Fe-single atom-nanoclusters for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction in Zn-air batteries","© The Royal Society of Chemistry.In this work, three-dimensional N, S co-doped carbon with high density Fe-single atom-nanoclusters of homogeneous dispersion (N, S co-doped CPANI-TA-Fe Fe-SA-NC catalysts) is successfully prepared by the optimal pyrolysis of freeze-dried polyaniline (PANI) hydrogels containing homogeneously distributed Fe precursors due to the controlled chelation between tannic acid (TA) and ferric ions and the interaction between Fe precursors and PANI for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. More importantly, active species (such as Fe single atoms, Fe-SA-NCs and Fe NPs) in the 3D N, S co-doped carbon materials can be controlled by judiciously adjusting the Fe-to-TA molar ratios. High density Fe-SA-NCs as active species (up to 5.6 wt%) in the N, S co-doped carbon are realized by controlling the Fe-to-TA molar ratio at 10. In addition, these Fe-SA-NCs are composed of isolated Fe-SAs, which are separated by the coordination with four N atoms and two O atoms. The resulting N, S co-doped CPANI-TA-Fe Fe-SA-NC catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) exhibit a higher half-wave potential (0.923 V vs. 0.88 V of Pt/C), a higher onset potential (1.09 V vs. 0.99 V of Pt/C), a higher kinetic-limiting current density (12 mA cm-2 at 0.9 V) and better long-term stability in alkaline media. Their ORR activity in acidic media is comparable to those recently reported in the literature. Additionally, the suitability and durability of N, S co-doped CPANI-TA-Fe Fe-SA-NC catalysts as the air electrode of a zinc-air battery were investigated. The fabricated Zn-air batteries exhibited a higher power density of 136.4 mW cm-2 and a higher specific capacity of 795.1 mA h g-1, which are better than those of the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst. Our synthetic strategy can be extended to prepare other metal nanocluster-based porous carbon materials as electrocatalysts in electrochemical energy devices, as TA can be chelated with diverse metal ions.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta04210b
A Cu and Fe dual-atom nanozyme mimicking cytochrome c oxidase to boost the oxygen reduction reaction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The intrinsically sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and overuse of expensive and unstable Pt-based catalysts have severely hampered the development of clean energy technologies. Herein, a type of non-noble metal nanozyme as an ORR electrocatalyst, with Fe-Cu dual atomic sites embedded in three-dimensional porous N-doped carbon (FeCu-DA/NC), is fabricated by mimicking both the constituents of active centers and enzymatic microenvironment of Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). The atomically dispersed Fe-Cu single atom sites are clearly identified by direct aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy imaging, systematic X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. FeCu-DA/NC exhibits a superior ORR activity, with about 30 mV more positive half-wave potential (E1/2) than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts in a base, and moreover with only an E1/2 gap of 20 mV to Pt/C in an acid. Importantly, FeCu-DA/NC displays an excellent durability under both acidic and basic conditions, which is much superior to that of Pt/C. DFT calculations further demonstrate that the enhanced performance can be attributed to the unique synergistic effect between Cu and Fe single atoms in which Cu-N4 serves as the electron donor to increase the electron density of the active centers of Fe-N4 and thus to facilitate O2 activation.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta06485h
Screening effective single-atom ORR and OER electrocatalysts from Pt decorated MXenes by first-principles calculations,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The ORR and OER properties of a series of recombinant single atom catalysts (SACs) prepared by recombining Pt single atoms on 26 representative MXenes were comprehensively studied by first-principles calculations. The stability of Pt atoms on the MXene surface was studied using formation energies and diffusion energy barriers. Charge transfer analysis showed that the Pt atoms not only acted as the catalytic center of the SACs but also behaved as a charge transfer medium between the MXene substrate and the reactants. The catalytic properties of the recombinant SACs were dependent on several interacting factors including the Pt-5d states, the work functions of the recombinant systems, the electronegativity of the submetals, and the vacant electron orbitals of the C/N and O/F elements of the MXenes. In all the recombinant SACs under investigation, V-, Ti-, Nb-, and Cr-based MXenes, including Ti2CF2-VF-Pt, Ti3C2F2-VF-Pt, V2CO2-VO-Pt, Nb2CF2-VF-Pt, Nb4C3F2-VF-Pt, Cr2TiC2F2-VF-Pt, Ti3(C,N)2-CO2-VO-Pt, and Ti3(C,N)2-NO2-VO-Pt, were screened as promising ORR catalysts. In particular, three F-terminated ones (Nb2CF2-VF-Pt, Nb4C3F2-VF-Pt, and Cr2TiC2F2-VF-Pt) were proposed as effective ORR/OER bifunctional catalysts. The results revealed the highly active nature of the selected SACs and highlighted the great potential of MXenes as efficient ORR and OER catalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta04429f
Discovery of main group single Sb-N4active sites for CO2electroreduction to formate with high efficiency,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Main group antimony (Sb) species are promising electrocatalysts that promote the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate, which is an important hydrogen storage material and a key chemical intermediate in many industrial reactions. Herein, we discovered that an Sb single atom (SA) material consisting of Sb-N4 moieties anchored on N-doped carbon (NC) nanosheets (named Sb SA/NC) could serve as a CO2RR catalyst to produce formate with high efficiency. Sb SA/NC exhibited a formate faradaic efficiency of 94.0% at -0.8 V vs. RHE. In situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the excellent CO2RR activity originated from the positively charged Sbδ+-N4 (0 < δ < 3) active sites. Our results present significant guidelines for the rational design and accurate modulation of main group metal (Sb, In, Sn, Bi, etc.) catalysts for the CO2RR at the atomic scale.

Seamlessly conductive Co(OH)2tailored atomically dispersed Pt electrocatalyst with a hierarchical nanostructure for an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have exhibited extraordinary catalytic performance due to the utmost atom utilization efficiency and unique electronic states via metal-support interactions. Rationally designing SACs at the atomic level by structural engineering is desirable for an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, single-atom Pt was anchored on two-dimensional (2D) Co(OH)2 nanosheets growing on Ag nanowires (PtSA-Co(OH)2@Ag NW) to construct a seamlessly conductive network hybrid catalyst via electrochemical phase transformation from metallic Co@Ag NW. The Ag NW network provides a continuous electron transport pathway through metal active sites, contributing to an extremely low charge transfer resistance (Rct, 0.7 Ω), and the hierarchical nanostructure has a large electrochemical surface area for high atom utilization efficiency and rich mass transport pathways for hydrogen generation and release. Moreover, Co(OH)2 tailored Pt sites induce a local tip-enhancement electric field region around the Pt site and more d contribution for boosting H adsorption and H2O adsorption. Thus, the synthesized PtSA-Co(OH)2@Ag NW catalyst shows outstanding HER activity with only 29 mV overpotential in 1.0 M KOH at 10 mA cm-2 and 22.5-fold higher mass activity than the commercial Pt/C catalyst.

Regulating the coordination environment through doping N atoms for single-atom Mn electrocatalyst of N2 reduction with high catalytic activity and selectivity: A theoretical study,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising way for ammonia synthesis, and developing novel electrocatalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity is an urgent matter. Herein, the catalytic performances of single-atom Mn catalysts supported with nitrogen-doped graphene substrates (MnSA@Vx-Ny, x = s, d. y = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.) for NRR have systematically investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The catalytic activity and selectivity of MnSA@Vx-Ny were discussed through reaction path, Gibbs free energy variation, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), electron transfer and projected density of states. The result reveals the adsorption energy of N2 and catalytic activity of MnSA@Vx-Ny were effectively regulated through modulating the coordination environment of Mn atom. MnSA@Vs-N1 has the highest catalytic activity and selectivity among all studied catalysts for NRR at room temperature. MnSA@Vs-N1 can facilitate NRR by the distal mechanism, and the potential determining step is *N2 + H++ e− → *NNH with a free energy variation of 0.77 eV. Simultaneously, HER is suppressed by the high selectivity of N2 adsorption on MnSA@Vs-N1. This adjusting method can provide a guideline for developing robust electrocatalyst for NRR.",Molecular Catalysis,10.1016/j.mcat.2020.111091
Engineering the coordination environment enables molybdenum single-atom catalyst for efficient oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2020With a half filled d-electron shell, molybdenum (Mo) plays an important role as catalysts in the petrochemical industry. However, Mo is generally regarded as not catalytically active for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared with other transition metals such as Fe and Co. Inspired by molybdoenzymes, herein, we successfully endow Mo single-atom catalyst with highly ORR catalytic activity though engineering the coordination environment. This unique Mo single-atom catalyst consists of oxygen and nitrogen dual-component coordinated central Mo atom anchored on porous carbon (Mo-O/N-C), showing prominent ORR catalytic performance compared to the state-of-the-art Pt/C under alkaline condition. The extraordinary performance of Mo-O/N-C electrocatalyst is also demonstrated in Zn-air batteries as an air cathode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the oxygen and nitrogen dual-component coordination could tailor the d-band center of Mo, subsequently optimizing its binding capability with reaction intermediates (O*, OH* and OOH*), hence accelerating overall ORR process. This work not only provides an efficient and commercially competitive ORR catalyst, but advancing further development of other electrocatalysts through engineering the coordination environment.",Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/j.jcat.2020.05.034
Reaction-driven transformation of Ni/NiO hybrid structure into Ni single atoms,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdN-doped carbon nanotube-supported Ni/NiO hybrid structures with Ni/NiO crystalline interfaces (NiO/Ni@NCNTs) were investigated as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution, featuring an overpotential of 87.5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. During catalyzation, reaction-driven transformation of Ni/NiO hybrid structures into Ni single atoms and clusters was observed on deformed NCNTs. These single atoms (clusters) remained anchored even after harsh washing in acid, manifesting that NiO/Ni@NCNTs may be used as a platform for stabilised site-isolated catalysis in practical electrolytic processes. Surface characterization shows that metallic Ni was shown to mainly originate from Ni atoms bonded to pyridinic N atoms of the carbon skeleton. As shown by theoretical calculations, the Gibbs free energy ΔG (H∗) of the H adsorption was minimised when a Ni atom was adjacent to an O atom on a Ni (111) surface, which indicated that metallic Ni partially covered with NiO was energetically favourable for the HER.",Materials Today Energy,10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100436
Achieving High Activity and Selectivity of Nitrogen Reduction via Fe-N3Coordination on Iron Single-Atom Electrocatalysts at Ambient Conditions,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) represents a highly promising process to ammonia synthesis for artificial N2 fixation. However, the yield rate for NH3 production and Faradaic efficiency (FE) are still low, which greatly hinder its widespread applications. Until now, although a variety of catalysts, including single-atom catalysts, have been developed for NRR in the pursuit of suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the corresponding higher FE, the limited NH3 yield rate makes them uncompetitive for the synthesis of ammonia. Herein, we report a Fe single-atom catalyst anchoring on a nitrogen-doped carbon substrate (Fe SAC/N-C) as a highly efficient NRR catalyst. The catalyst achieves a high FE of 39.6% in 0.1 M KOH under room temperature, particularly a dramatically enhanced NH3 yield rate of 53.12 μgNH3 h-1 mgcat-1. The isotopic labeling (15N2) experiment confirms that the NH3 production completely originates from N2 reduction. Meanwhile, theoretical calculations and X-ray fine structure analysis reveal that the Fe-N3 coordination of Fe SAC/N-C is indeed responsible for the suppression of HER, particularly resulting in a maximum activation of NRR intermediates to produce ammonia with a high yield rate.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c02701
A rational synthesis of single-atom iron-nitrogen electrocatalysts for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Developing low-cost nonprecious catalysts to replace Pt-based material is of great significance and importance for high-performance energy devices. Designing highly efficient, stable, and economic oxygen reaction electrocatalysts with atomically-dispersed metal-N-C active sites through an effective strategy is highly desired for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Currently, the preparation of monoatomic catalysts with high loading and high activity, and the assurance of active sites fully exposed and participating in the reaction is challenging. Herein, atomically-dispersed Fe sites anchored to a porous carbon (Fe-SA/PC) hybrid synthesized via a facile dual-confinement route is reported. The experimental and theoretical simulations reveal that edge oxygen dopants facilitate the micropore trapping of the organic iron complex and the formation of isolated Fe atoms by subsequent pyrolysis. The optimized Fe-SA/PC catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.91 V, which is superior to most of the reported single-atom catalysts. DFT calculations proved that Fe-Nx sites with carbon defects can synergistically reduce the reaction barriers as compared to the intact Fe-Nx atomic configuration. This work provides a promising strategy for the design and construction of a series of high performance single-atom catalysts. This journal is",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta04798h
Photochemically activated atomic ruthenium supported on boron-doped carbon as a robust electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Tailored single-atom catalysts can trigger breakthroughs in the development of high-performance and low-cost energy conversion systems, especially in the case of supported noble metal electrocatalysts. However, the weak interactions between unsaturated metal atoms and supports can result in metal dissolution or aggregation in a harsh electrochemical environment. Here we report a facile yet effective method to stabilize atomic Ru-N sites on boron-doped carbon by mild photo-activation. Owing to the presence of adjacent B/N co-doped pairs, Ru atoms are firmly anchored on Ru-N-B-C centers leading to an enhanced metal-support interaction, with a Gibbs free energy close to zero for adsorption of H∗. The resulting highly stabilized atomic Ru has excellent catalytic activity with efficient metal utilization towards the hydrogen evolution reaction in either alkaline or acidic electrolyte (with turnover frequencies of 2.82 and 1.02 H2 per s, respectively), along with good rate capability and anti-reverse-current ability in long-term operation. This work opens a new route to prepare highly robust single-atom catalysts, which have good prospects for practical application in high-performance and low-cost electrochemical energy conversion devices.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta02107e
"Active Sites in Single-Atom Fe-Nx-C Nanosheets for Selective Electrochemical Dechlorination of 1,2-Dichloroethane to Ethylene","Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Electrochemical dechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) is one of the prospective and economic strategies for the preparation of high-value ethylene. However, the exploration of advanced electrocatalysts with high reactivity and selectivity and the identification of their active sites are still a challenge. Herein, a single-atom (SA) Fe-Nx-C nanosheet with the presence of a highly efficient Fe-N4 coordination pattern is reported. The as-prepared single-atom electrocatalyst exhibits a higher reactivity and ethylene selectivity for DCE dechlorination reaction than those of the commercially adopted 20% Pt-C catalyst. By a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations, the atomically dispersed Fe center in the Fe-N4 structure was unveiled to be the dominating active site for electrochemical production of ethylene. Our work would offer an approach for the rational development of SA materials and supply crucial insight into the mechanism of ethylene production through the DCE dechlorination reaction.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.0c02783
Co-N-doped carbon as an efficient catalyst for lithium-oxygen batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Lithium-oxygen batteries have received much research attention, and the issue of high overpotential of lithium-oxygen batteries is pivotal to be resolved. Developing efficient electrocatalysts is considered to be a feasible way. Here, we prepared Co and N co-doped carbon material from ZIF-8 via a two-step route, in which Co is atomically dispersed into the ZIF-8-derived N-doped carbon matrix. This obtained single atom Co-N-C catalyst was applied as an efficient catalyst for the lithium-oxygen battery. The Co-N-C cathode lithium-oxygen battery can deliver a high platform of 2.7 V during discharge, and the charging platform is below 4 V. Co-N-doped carbon can improve the work function of the carbon material, effectively reduce overpotential of both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, and thus improve the performance of the lithium-oxygen battery.",Energy and Fuels,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c02021
Active Sites of Single-Atom Iron Catalyst for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Electrochemical water splitting in alkaline media is an attractive way to produce the clear and renewable hydrogen fuel H2. In this work, we report a single-atom Fe1/NC catalyst, where the Fe-Nx moiety works as the active site, for high-efficiency alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Fe1/NC electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 111 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2, with a Tafel slope of 86.1 mV dec-1 in 1 M KOH solution. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that, under the working states, the Fe-support interaction weakened as the Fe-N coordination number and Fe oxidation state decreased. As such, the evolved single-atom Fe site with more d electrons provides a favorable structure for boosting HER performance. This work gives insight into the structural evolution of the active site under the alkaline HER and provides a strategy for the design of non-noble metal electrocatalysts.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c01943
"Versatile Synthesis of Pd−M (M=Cr, Mo, W) Alloy Nanosheets Flower-like Superstructures for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis","© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimPd-based nanoalloys are promising electrocatalysts for replacing Pt-based ones toward oxygen reduction reaction. Despite that great progress has been achieved, universally synthesizing Pd-based alloy nanosheets and further integrating them into porous or hierarchical superstructures remain a challenge, and their ORR performances are not systematically investigated. Herein, novel ultrathin and highly wrinkled Pd−M (M=Cr, Mo, W) alloy nanosheets flower-like superstructures (NSFSs) are universally fabricated via a polyether and small molecules/ions ligand assisted solvothermal method. Such Pd−M NSFSs possess mesoporous structures and co-exist single-atom-like and cluster-like M species on their surfaces. Compared with pure Pd NSFSs, those Pd−M NSFSs show greatly enhanced ORR activity in alkaline media. Due to the unique microstructure feature, proper alloy constituent and stronger interatomic polarization or electronic coupling, the Pd−W NSFSs show the highest ORR activity with the half-wave potential of 0.89 V (vs. RHE) and mass activity of 0.46 A mgPd −1 at 0.90 V (vs. RHE), outperforming commercial Pt/C, and most of reported Pd(or Pt)-based catalysts. Moreover, the Pd−W NSFSs manifest outstanding durability and anti-CO poisoning ability yet.

Cu Anchored Ti2NO2 as High Performance Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction: A Density Functional Theory Study,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimMXenes have attracted great attention in the fields of energy conversion and catalysis, and have proved to be an effective supporting material for single atom catalysts (SACs). In the present study, we investigated the catalytic activity of a series mono-atomic transition-metal atoms supported by MXenes M2NO2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via first principle calculation. Particularly, single atom Cu site on Ti2NO2 having the lowest overpotentials of 0.24 V and bonding with the reaction intermediates moderately, is the most active SAC for OER. Energetically, Cu atom prefers to be mono-atomically anchored on Ti2NO2 instead of aggregating. Plus, Cu anchoring enhance the electronic states around Fermi level. Additionally, ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations show that Cu atom is anchored on Ti2NO2, stable and isolatable at 300 K. Studies on the small molecule adsorption on Cu-Ti2NO2 further prove the potential applications of Cu−Ti2NO2 as active SACs for OER.

Electrochemical Conversion of CO2to Syngas with Palladium-Based Electrocatalysts,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.ConspectusElectrocatalytic reduction of CO2 is a desirable method to produce valuable products from CO2. One of the main research challenges for electrocatalysis that produces carbon-containing products from CO2 is avoiding unwanted hydrogen production. Instead of totally eliminating hydrogen, our approach makes use of the readily available protons in aqueous electrolyte to coproduce CO and H2, making synthesis gas (syngas) with a tunable CO:H2 ratio; the resulting syngas can then be used as feedstock for existing thermocatalytic processes such as Fischer-Tropsch and methanol synthesis reactions. We discovered that palladium hydride (PdH), formed under electrocatalytic reaction conditions, is an effective electrocatalyst that enables this unique product distribution. We employed in situ synchrotron techniques to determine the formation of the PdH phase during electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. We also performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine the binding energies of key intermediates on PdH to identify descriptors to correlate experimentally observed trends in activity and selectivity.Since first reporting on the potential application of PdH to produce syngas, our research group has refined control over the syngas product selectivity, improved the activity, and reduced the loading of Pd in electrocatalysts. We achieved this by the following approaches: Understanding the structure-function relationship with shape-controlled Pd nanoparticles, determining the cation and isotopic effects of electrolyte, alloying Pd with inexpensive secondary metals, supporting Pd on transition metal carbides and nitrides, and utilizing single atom Pd catalysts. At each step, we monitored the phase transition from Pd to PdH under reaction conditions with in situ synchrotron-based X-ray absorption and X-ray diffraction techniques by identifying the onset potential for the appearance of the characteristic Pd-Pd bond length and diffraction patterns associated with PdH formation. We also identified descriptors for syngas production on PdH, bimetallic PdH, and supported PdH catalysts by correlating DFT calculations of PdH stability in different catalytic systems as well as the effect of PdH formation on the binding strength of reaction intermediates. The research methodology established here is useful not only for continued optimization of Pd-based syngas-producing electrocatalysts but also for enhancing activity while reducing the loading of precious metals for other electrocatalytic applications. Moreover, we feel the advances in electrocatalytic syngas production described here represent a critical step toward sustainable CO2 utilization that should inspire continued efforts.",Accounts of Chemical Research,10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00277
Atomically dispersed Ni species on N-doped carbon nanotubes for electroreduction of CO2 with nearly 100% CO selectivity,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.It is imperative to develop efficient and robust electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) that would overcome the sluggish kinetics and exhibit high current density. Porous carbon nanotubes with highly delocalized electrons and tubular structure are promising candidates for CO2RR due to it is favorable for the accessible of substrates to active sites. However, there are rare reports of using carbon nanotubes to stabilize single-atom active sites for CO2RR. Herein, a self-sacrificial template method is developed to disperse single atomic Ni sites on N-doped carbon nanotubes from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for highly efficient CO2RR.

Stable Multifunctional Single-Atom Catalysts Resulting from the Synergistic Effect of Anchored Transition-Metal Atoms and Host Covalent-Organic Frameworks,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are highly demanded in energy conversion and storage techniques. The single-atom catalytic (SAC) technique emerged as a promising strategy to reach this goal but is currently facing obstacles such as migration and aggregation of active atoms and low metal loading. We demonstrated from first principles that the two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) of phthalocyanines and pyrazine linkages can firmly anchor transition-metal (TM) atoms. The resultant TM-embedded COFs (TM-COFs) exhibit multifunctional electrocatalytic activity for HER, OER, and ORR, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the anchored TM atoms and COFs. Specifically, Mn- and Cr-COFs are predicted to have extremely low overpotentials of -0.014/0.44/0.31 and -0.239/0.35/0.29 V for HER/OER/ORR, which are comparable or even superior to those of the well-developed noble catalysts. We also proposed the electron transfer Δδfrom TM atom to the framework and p-band center ϵp of carbon atoms as descriptors for the adsorption strength of intermediates on the TM-COF monolayers. In view of the recent experimental progress on the synthesis of the TM-COFs, these computational results offer not only economical alternatives of noble catalysts but also a promising strategy for the design of multifunctional electrocatalysts.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c04360
Atomic-Scale Dispersed Fe-Based Catalysts Confined on Nitrogen-Doped Graphene for Li-S Batteries: Polysulfides with Enhanced Conversion Efficiency,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium-sulfur batteries have been considered as potential electrochemical energy-storage devices owing to their satisfactory theoretical energy density. Nonetheless, the inferior conversion efficiency of polysulfides in essence leads to fast capacity decay during the discharge/charge cycle. In this work, it is successfully demonstrated that the conversion efficiency of lithium polysulfides is remarkably enhanced by employing a well-distributed atomic-scale Fe-based catalyst immobilized on nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe@NG) as a coating of separator in lithium-sulfur batteries. The quantitative electrocatalytic efficiency of the conversion of lithium polysulfides is determined through cyclic voltammetry. It is also proven that the Fe-NX configuration with highly catalytic activity is quite beneficial for the conversion of lithium polysulfides. In addition, the adsorption and permeation experiments distinctly indicate that the strong anchoring effect, originated from the charge redistribution of N doping into the graphene matrix, inhibits the movement of lithium polysulfides. Thanks to these advantages, if the as-prepared Fe@NG catalyst is combined with polypropylene and applied as a separator (Fe@NG/PP) in Li-S batteries, a high initial capacity (1616 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C), excellent capacity retention (93 % at 0.2 C, 70 % at 2 C), and superb rate performance (820 mA h g−1 at 2 C) are achieved.",Chemistry - A European Journal,10.1002/chem.202001282

Trace amounts of Bi are atomically dispersed on the surface of the Ni97Bi3 aerogel, which leads to an optimum shift of the d-band center of Ni, large compressive strain of Bi, and greatly increased conductivity of the aerogel.

Single transition metal atoms anchored on a C2N monolayer as efficient catalysts for hydrazine electrooxidation,"© the Owner Societies.Searching for highly-efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is a key issue in the development of direct hydrazine fuel cells for hydrogen production, which is a promising energy-efficient conversion technology to replace the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction in water splitting. Herein, the potential of a series of single transition metal atoms anchored on nitrogenated holey graphene (TM@C2N, TM = Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Rh, Ru, Pd, Pt, Au, Ag, and W) as catalysts for the HzOR was systematically explored by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations. Our results revealed that these TM atoms anchored on a C2N monolayer exhibit high stability due to their strong interactions with the N atoms on the C2N monolayer. Furthermore, on the basis of the computed free energy profiles, Ru@C2N, Mo@C2N, Ti@C2N, Co@C2N, and Fe@C2N were shown to display high HzOR catalytic activity due to their lower (or comparable) limiting potential compared to the well-established Fe-doped CoS2 nanosheet. In particular, Ru@C2N is identified as the best catalyst with the lowest limiting potential of-0.24 V due to its optimum difference between the adsorption strength of N2H3∗ and N2H2∗ species. More interestingly, we found that single Mo and Ti atoms also exhibit excellent catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction, suggesting their bifunctional activity towards hydrazine splitting for H2 production. Our findings provide a new avenue to develop an efficient single-atom electrocatalyst for experimental validation to convert hydrazine into hydrogen.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d0cp02930k
Immiscible bi-metal single-atoms driven synthesis of electrocatalysts having superb mass-activity and durability,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Properties of metal elements can be modified by alloying.

Cu-SAs along with Ru-NPs enhance electric conduction or charge-transfer rate of GN-templates for fast kinetics. Owing to Cu-Ru immiscibility, the coordination of Cu-SAs by N atoms which bridge to Ru-NPs surface, introduces new active sites and brings about long-term stability (over 600 h in acidic media) by preventing aggregation of Ru-NPs.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118896
Progress of Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis over Single Atom Catalysts,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via the two-electron pathway provides a promising approach for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and its on-site utilizations. The effective electrocatalyst is one of the key factors determining the future applications of this technology. In recent years, various catalysts, such as pristine carbon materials, modified carbon materials (oxidized or heteroatom doped such as nitrogen, fluorine, or sulfur doped), gold, or mercury alloyed palladium or platinum nanoparticles, as well as transition metal single atom catalysts (SACs) have been reported to effectively catalyze the H2O2 production via the two-electron ORR process. Among these candidates, SACs with 100% atom utilization and well-defined active centers attracted extra attention due to their high catalytic performance for H2O2 synthesis. In this review, the thermodynamics, oxygen molecular activation, and theoretical screening and prediction of SACs for electrochemical H2O2 synthesis are discussed. The catalytic performance, reaction kinetics and mechanism of SACs together with electrochemical devices for H2O2 synthesis via the two-electron ORR are summarized. It is hoped that this contribution can offer a comprehensive reference for the progress of SACs in H2O2 electrochemical production process.",ACS Materials Letters,10.1021/acsmaterialslett.0c00189
Electrocatalytically Active Fe-(O-C2)4 Single-Atom Sites for Efficient Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSingle-atom catalysts have demonstrated their superiority over other types of catalysts for various reactions. However, the reported nitrogen reduction reaction single-atom electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction exclusively utilize metal–nitrogen or metal–carbon coordination configurations as catalytic active sites. Here, we report a Fe single-atom electrocatalyst supported on low-cost, nitrogen-free lignocellulose-derived carbon. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra confirm that Fe atoms are anchored to the support via the Fe-(O-C2)4 coordination configuration. Density functional theory calculations identify Fe-(O-C2)4 as the active site for the nitrogen reduction reaction. An electrode consisting of the electrocatalyst loaded on carbon cloth can afford a NH3 yield rate and faradaic efficiency of 32.1 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 (5350 μg h−1 mgFe−1) and 29.3 %, respectively. An exceptional NH3 yield rate of 307.7 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 (51 283 μg h−1 mgFe−1) with a near record faradaic efficiency of 51.0 % can be achieved with the electrocatalyst immobilized on a glassy carbon electrode.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202005930
Single Ni Atoms and Clusters Embedded in N-Doped Carbon “Tubes on Fibers” Matrix with Bifunctional Activity for Water Splitting at High Current Densities,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAmong the bifunctional catalysts for water splitting, recently emerged transition-metal single-atom catalysts are theoretically considered to possess high potential, while the experimental activity is not satisfactory yet. Herein, an exceptionally efficient trifunctional metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) catalyst electrode, composed of a hierarchical carbon matrix embedding isolated nickel atoms with nickel–iron (NiFe) clusters, is presented. 1D microfibers and nanotubes grow sequentially from 2D nanosheets as sacrificial templates via two stages of solution- and solid-phase reactions to form a 1D hierarchy. Exceptionally efficient bifunctional activity with an overpotential of only 13 mV at 10 mA cm−2 toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and an overpotential of 210 mV at 30 mA cm−2 toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is obtained, surpassing each monofunctional activity ever reported. More importantly, an overpotential of only 126 and 326 mV is required to drive 500 mA cm−2 toward the HER and OER, respectively. For the first time, industrial-scale water splitting with two bifunctional catalyst electrodes with a current density of 500 mA cm−2 at a potential of 1.71 V is demonstrated. Lastly, trifunctional catalytic activity including oxygen reduction reaction is also proven with a half-wave potential at 0.848 V.",Small,10.1002/smll.202002511
Synergizing Mo Single Atoms and Mo2C Nanoparticles on CNTs Synchronizes Selectivity and Activity of Electrocatalytic N2 Reduction to Ammonia,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimPrevious research of molybdenum-based electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has been largely considered on either isolated Mo single atoms (MoSAs) or Mo carbide particles (e.g., Mo2C) separately, while an integrated synergy (MoSAs-Mo2C) of the two has never been considered. The theoretical calculations show that the Mo single atoms and Mo2C nanoparticles exhibit, respectively, different catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and NRR selectivity. Therefore, a new role-playing synergistic mechanism can be well enabled for the multistep NRR, when the two are combined on the same N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs). This hypothesis is confirmed experimentally, where the MoSAs-Mo2C assembled on NCNTs (MoSAs-Mo2C/NCNTs) yields an ammonia formation rate of 16.1 µg h−1 cmcat−2 at −0.25 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is about four times that by the Mo2C alone (Mo2C/NCNTs) and 4.5 times that by the MoSAs alone (MoSAs/NCNTs). Moreover, the Faradic efficiency of the MoSAs-Mo2C/NCNTs is raised up to twofold and sevenfold of the Mo2C/NCNTs and MoSAs/NCNTs, respectively. The MoSAs-Mo2C/NCNTs also demonstrate outstanding stability by the almost unchanged catalytic performance over 10 h of the chronoamperometric test. The present study provides a promising new prototype of synchronizing the selectivity and activity for the multistep catalytic reactions.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202002177
Ru-doped phosphorene for electrochemical ammonia synthesis,"© 2020, The Nonferrous Metals Society of China and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Abstract: The electrochemical ammonia synthesis has attracted increasing attention due to its energy saving characteristics. However, developing novel electrocatalysts and their mechanism remain great challenges. Here, several transition metal (TM) atoms doped on phosphorene were studied as N2 fixation electrocatalysts by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results demonstrate that single Ru atom doped phosphorene shows an excellent catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis via the enzymatic pattern. A small overpotential of 0.696 V is achieved for this process. The effect of oxidation in the catalyst was also discussed in our work. Oxidation deactivates the catalyst, which should be avoided in the experiment. Our outcomes offer a novel perspective for single-atom catalytic ammonia synthesis with phosphorene as a substrate.

Atomically embedded asymmetrical dual-metal dimers on N-doped graphene for ultra-efficient nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.The atomically dispersed metal species on nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets have exhibited impressive catalytic properties towards oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction and carbon dioxide reactions (OER/ORR/CRR), but poor performances for nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR). The main reason is ascribed to the sluggish kinetics of the first and last proton-coupled electron transfer (ET) on the unitary single-atom site. In this work, an asymmetrical dual-metal dimer catalytic center, which is inspired by the active sites of natural enzymes, such as nitrogenases, that efficiently catalyze the reduction of N2 to NH3 through FeMo cofactors, is theoretically reported. Remarkably, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the random combination of two non-precious metal atoms such as Fe, Co, Mo, W and Ru to form catalytically active bimetallic sites lead to a remarkable reduction of about two times of the first or last hydrogenation free energy barrier step. The resulting Mo-Ru, Mo-Co, Mo-W, Mo-Fe and Fe-Ru dimers exhibited ultra-low onset potentials of only 0.17, 0.27, 0.28, 0.36 and 0.39 V, respectively. Meanwhile, the HER side reaction can be well suppressed during the NRR. The superior catalytic performance in the bimetallic clusters is mainly attributed to both the electron donation from the asymmetrical metal atoms to the terminal side-on of N2 molecules, which significantly polarizes and weakens the N≡N bond, and to the synergistic effect of the dual-metal dimers that moderates the binding strength of the key intermediates. This work constitutes the first DFT study of the N2 electroreduction processes on dual-metal dimer catalytic sites and, consequently, paves the way towards the rational design of highly efficient hetero-bimetallic NRR electrocatalysts.",Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/j.jcat.2020.05.009
Bioinspired Mo tape-porphyrin as an efficient and selective electrocatalyst for ammonia synthesis,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.The efficient N2 fixation to NH3 in the biological system benefits from the electron transfer and catalysis of nitrogenase under ambient conditions, where N2 reduction occurs at Mo and Fe sites. Herein, the electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) on bioinspired Mo tape-porphyrin (denoted as MoP) has been systematically investigated on the basis of first-principles calculations. The anchoring of Mo atom to the biomolecular porphyrin changes the charge distribution and activates more delocalized π electrons in the fully conjugated π-system. The results reveal that N2 favourably coordinated with Mo atom in end-on configuration and the electronic and magnetic properties of MoP are changed. The most promising reaction pathway for NRR on MoP is via the distal route with overpotential of 0.22 V. The excellent conductivity, highly localized and spin-polarized Mo-4d states of MoP endow it preeminent NRR activity at room temperature. Furthermore, the competitive 2-electron hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is sufficiently mitigated and circumvented during the NRR progress. The high symmetry of MoP enables a simple synthetic pathway. Our findings provide a ingenious strategy for catalytic N2 reduction and a practical manufacturing method for designing efficient and selective electrocatalyst.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.146202
High-performance Ru-based electrocatalyst composed of Ru nanoparticles and Ru single atoms for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline solution,"© 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCHydrogen evolution reaction (HER) plays a critical role in electrocatalysis, and developing highly active, cheap and stable Pt-free catalysts for HER in alkaline media is imperative for conversion of renewable energy into hydrogen fuels via photo/electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate a high-performance Ru-NMCNs-T electrocatalyst (T is the annealing temperature) for HER, which consist of both Ru nanoparticles and single Ru atoms well dispersed on nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres (NMCNs). Ru-NMCNs-500 exhibited the best HER performance in the series. To achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, it only needs an overpotential of 28 mV with a small Tafel slope of 35.2 mA dec−1, superior to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. It also exhibited exceedingly improved long-term stability than Pt/C. This study can open a new avenue for preparing Ru-based catalysts toward HER under extreme alkaline conditions.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.064
Stable and Efficient Single-Atom Zn Catalyst for CO2Reduction to CH4,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.The development of highly active and durable catalysts for electrochemical reduction of CO2 (ERC) to CH4 in aqueous media is an efficient and environmentally friendly solution to address global problems in energy and sustainability. In this work, an electrocatalyst consisting of single Zn atoms supported on microporous N-doped carbon was designed to enable multielectron transfer for catalyzing ERC to CH4 in 1 M KHCO3 solution. This catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 85%, a partial current density of -31.8 mA cm-2 at a potential of -1.8 V versus saturated calomel electrode, and remarkable stability, with neither an obvious current drop nor large FE fluctuation observed during 35 h of ERC, indicating a far superior performance than that of dominant Cu-based catalysts for ERC to CH4. Theoretical calculations reveal that single Zn atoms largely block CO generation and instead facilitate the production of CH4.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.9b12111
An effective hybrid electrocatalyst for the alkaline HER: Highly dispersed Pt sites immobilized by a functionalized NiRu-hydroxide,"© 2020Developing a highly active and robust catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using the minimal amount of Pt is a continuing challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a functionalized NiRu-hydroxide (NiRu-OH) catalyst that acts as a capable candidate to immobilize highly dispersed single Pt atoms. We synthesize this catalyst by means of Ru leaching from a NiRu-layer double hydroxide (NiRu-LDH) under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. The hybrid catalyst shows extremely high HER activity, with an overpotential of 38 mV to drive a typical current density of 10 mA cmgeo−2 in alkaline media. We ascribe the excellent catalytic activity to the synergistic effect of the highly dispersed single Pt atoms and NiRu-OH in a dual-site alkaline HER mechanism. This work forms the basis for the exploration of matrices capable of trapping single atoms for various applications.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118824
Engineering Isolated Mn-N2C2Atomic Interface Sites for Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reaction,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Oxygen-involved electrochemical reactions are crucial for plenty of energy conversion techniques. Herein, we rationally designed a carbon-based Mn-N2C2 bifunctional electrocatalyst. It exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.915 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and the overpotential is 350 mV at 10 mA cm-2 during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline condition. Furthermore, by means of operando X-ray absorption fine structure measurements, we reveal that the bond-length-extended Mn2+-N2C2 atomic interface sites act as active centers during the ORR process, while the bond-length-shortened high-valence Mn4+-N2C2 moieties serve as the catalytic sites for OER, which is consistent with the density functional theory results. The atomic and electronic synergistic effects for the isolated Mn sites and the carbon support play a critical role to promote the oxygen-involved catalytic performance, by regulating the reaction free energy of intermediate adsorption. Our results give an atomic interface strategy for nonprecious bifunctional single-atom electrocatalysts.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c01925
Densely colonized isolated Cu-N single sites for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts and rechargeable advanced Zn-air batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.The rational design of earth-abundant, highly efficient, and robust bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts remains a contemporary challenge toward the widespread implementation of reversible metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Here, we report a universal strategy for the fabrication of single-atom (Cu, Co, and Fe) incorporated hollow nano-spheroids of nitrogen-deficient carbon nitride frameworks (CuSA@HNCNx. The interconnected three-dimensional 3D porous and hollow robust single-atom spheroid frameworks display a high surface area of 1286 m2 g−1, favorable electronic structure, local chemical coordination, effective density of active sites (Cu-Nx, pyridinic, graphitic C–N etc.), and mass transport pathways. The obtained CuSA@HNCNx exhibited outstanding bifunctional reversible electrocatalytic activity and robustness for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR half-wave potential of 0.91 V, OER overpotential of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm-2, ΔE = 0.64 V, 5000 cycles), outperforming benchmarked Pt/C and RuO2. Electrocatalytic activity towards ORR/OER was analyzed by D-band center correlation using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, reversible alkaline Zn-air batteries with the designed CuSA@HNCNx cathode illustrated a high power 212 mW cm-2, high energy density 1031 Wh kgZn−1, and excellent discharge-charge cycle life of 1800 cycles for 300 h @10 mA cm-2 with voltaic efficiency of 64.51 %.

Dual-atom Ag2/graphene catalyst for efficient electroreduction of CO2 to CO,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical reduction of CO2 into value-added carbon compounds offers a promising strategy to mitigate global warming, but present challenges for chemistry due to the poor selectivity and stability of electrocatalysts. In this work, we report a dual-atom Ag2/graphene catalyst featuring well-defined AgN3-AgN3 active site for CO2 electrochemical reduction. This dual-atom catalyst can drive CO2 reduction reaction at a potential as high as -0.25 V, and exhibit excellent CO Faradic efficiency up to 93.4 % with a current density of 11.87 mA cm−2 at -0.7 V and long-term stability, far surpassing the single-atom Ag1/graphene and the traditional silver nanoparticle catalysts. DFT calculations reveal that the dual-atom Ag site lowers the barrier for the formation of *COOH by stabilizing the *CO2 through the concomitant interactions with the C and an O atom of CO2, resulting in excellent catalytic performance.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118747
Synergistic Effect of Surface-Terminated Oxygen Vacancy and Single-Atom Catalysts on Defective MXenes for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.The production of ammonia (NH3) from molecular dinitrogen (N2) under ambient conditions is of great significance but remains as a great challenge. Using first-principles calculations, we have investigated the potential of using a transition metal (TM) atom embedded on defective MXene nanosheets (Ti3-xC2Oy and Ti2-xCOy with a Ti vacancy) as a single-atom electrocatalyst (SAC) for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). The Ti3-xC2Oy nanosheet with Mo and W embedded, and the Ti2-xC2Oy nanosheet with Cr, Mo, and W embedded, can significantly promote the NRR while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with the low limiting potential of-0.11 V for W/Ti2-xC2Oy. The outstanding performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the exposed Ti atom and the TM atom around an extra oxygen vacancy. The polarization charges of the active center are reasonably tuned by the embedded TM atoms, which can optimize the binding strength of key intermediate *N2H. The good feasibility of preparing such TM SACs on defective MXenes and the high NRR selectivity with regard to the competitive HER suggest new opportunities for driving NH3 production by MXene-based SAC electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c01415
Rational Prediction of Single Metal Atom Supported on Two-Dimensional Metal Diborides for Electrocatalytic N2Reduction Reaction with Integrated Descriptor,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) plays an important role in chemical industry, so it is significant to develop low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts for nitrogen fixation instead of the traditional Haber-Bosch process. In this paper, the electrocatalytic performance of various single atoms doped on two-dimensional metal diborides with a B vacancy for N2 reduction to ammonia is calculated and predicted. By screening numerous catalysts, we find that Ti@VB2 is the most active catalyst for NRR, and the limiting potential of Ti@VB2 for NRR is-0.61 V. Through high-throughput search and LASSO regression, an integrated descriptor combining the intrinsic properties of the single transition metal atom (TM) and the substrate (MB2) is proposed, which can fit the relationship between intrinsic properties of catalysts and NRR activity well. Therefore, this study not only discovers a promising electrocatalyst for nitrogen fixation but also provides a strategy for predicting the activity of catalysts.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c01582
Substrate strain engineering: An efficient strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of SACs on waved graphene for e-NRR,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Ammonia is an important chemical in both industry and agriculture. The production of ammonia in a green way is challenging. The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (e-NRR) has been proposed for this purpose. However, this technology is still far from practical applications due to low production, which is mainly because of inefficient electrocatalysts. In this work, we have designed a series of single-atom catalysts (SACs) anchored on waved graphene (wG) for efficient e-NRR and systematically investigated the effect of curvature on the catalytic performance based on first-principles calculations. Eight SACs (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Pt) anchored on waved graphene with various curvatures (0-50%) have been studied. We found that the curvature strongly affected the formation, catalytic activity, and selectivity of SACs for e-NRR: (1) the formation possibility of SACs on wG was considerably enhanced on increasing the curvature. (2) The free energies for the rate-determining steps of SAC-V-wG, SAC-Mn-wG, and SAC-Cr-wG were less than 1.0 eV, leading to high catalytic activity for e-NRR. In particular, SAC-Mn-wG exhibited higher activity for e-NRR than SAC-Mn on flat graphene. (3) The three systems had higher selectivity for e-NRR than for HER, which could be further improved by compression. Thus, we conclude that SAC-Mn-wG is the best SAC on wG for e-NRR because of its easy fabrication, good catalytic performance and high selectivity. We believe that our findings can provide new insights in reported experimental results and guidance for the design of novel SACs with high performance for e-NRR.

Dual Single-Atomic Ni-N4 and Fe-N4 Sites Constructing Janus Hollow Graphene for Selective Oxygen Electrocatalysis,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimNitrogen-coordinated metal single atoms in carbon have aroused extensive interest recently and have been growing as an active research frontier in a wide range of key renewable energy reactions and devices. Herein, a step-by-step self-assembly strategy is developed to allocate nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) single atoms respectively on the inner and outer walls of graphene hollow nanospheres (GHSs), realizing separate-sided different single-atom functionalization of hollow graphene. The Ni or Fe single atom is demonstrated to be coordinated with four N atoms via the formation of a Ni-N4 or Fe-N4 planar configuration. The developed Ni-N4/GHSs/Fe-N4 Janus material exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, in which the outer Fe-N4 clusters dominantly contribute to high activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the inner Ni-N4 clusters are responsible for excellent activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate the structures and reactivities of Fe-N4 and Ni-N4 for the ORR and OER. The Ni-N4/GHSs/Fe-N4 endows a rechargeable Zn–air battery with excellent energy efficiency and cycling stability as an air-cathode, outperforming that of the benchmark Pt/C+RuO2 air-cathode.

"Single-atom-Ni-decorated, nitrogen-doped carbon layers for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction","© 2020 The Author(s)Efficient selective electroreduction of carbon dioxide into energy-dense carbonaceous fuel products is highly desirable to mitigate environmental and energy-related problems. However, there is still a need to design an electrocatalyst with high selectivity and stability towards the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR). Here, we present the promising performance of single-atom-Ni-decorated, nitrogen-doped carbon layers (SA-Ni@NC) as an efficient electrocatalyst for CRR. In this catalyst the Ni atoms are atomically dispersed and most have three-fold coordination with the N atoms in the carbon layers. Theoretical calculations show that the Ni-N3-C site can act as a highly active site for the reduction of CO2 owing to the low energy barrier for the formation of *COOH intermediates. As a consequence, SA-Ni@NC exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency (up to 86.2%) for the production of CO at a potential of −0.6 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, this simple method can also be used to produce a range of single-atom catalysts (such as SA-Co@NC). In view of the large family of zeolite imidazolate frameworks, we anticipate that our strategy will be extended to a variety of single-atom-decorated, nitrogen-doped carbon layers with a broad range of applications in energy conversion systems.",Electrochemistry Communications,10.1016/j.elecom.2020.106758
Synergistic trifunctional electrocatalysis of pyridinic nitrogen and single transition-metal atoms anchored on pyrazine-modified graphdiyne,"© 2020 Science China PressMultifunctional catalysts that integrate high efficiency hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity in a single material are attractive for unitized regenerative fuel cells and overall water splitting technologies. As the best-known HER and ORR electrocatalysts, Pt and its alloys have only moderate OER activity. Ruthenium and iridium oxides exhibit the highest OER activities but not as active as Pt for HER and ORR. Here, we proposed a general principle for achieving trifunctional electrocatalysis for three reactions in a single material. Using the newly-synthesized pyrazine-modified graphdiyne (PR-GDY) as an example, we demonstrated that the synergistic effect of the pyridinic nitrogen and anchored transition-metal (TM) single atoms renders highly-efficient HER/OER/ORR trifunctional electrocatalytic activity. For the Ni-doped PR-GDY, the overpotentials for HER, OER and ORR can be respectively as low as −0.05, 0.29 and 0.38 V, which are comparable or even superior to the best-known single-functional and bi-functional precious electrocatalysts. These computational results offer not only a promising trifunctional electrocatalyst but also a strategy for the design of multifunctional electrocatalysts.",Science Bulletin,10.1016/j.scib.2020.03.021
A Janus Fe-SnO2 Catalyst that Enables Bifunctional Electrochemical Nitrogen Fixation,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimElectrochemical N2 reduction reactions (NRR) and the N2 oxidation reaction (NOR), using H2O and N2, are a sustainable approach to N2 fixation. To date, owing to the chemical inertness of nitrogen, emerging electrocatalysts for the electrochemical NRR and NOR at room temperature and atmospheric pressure remain largely underexplored. Herein, a new-type Fe-SnO2 was designed as a Janus electrocatalyst for achieving highly efficient NRR and NOR catalysis. A high NH3 yield of 82.7 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 20.4 % were obtained for NRR. This catalyst can also serve as an excellent NOR electrocatalyst with a NO3− yields of 42.9 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and a FE of 0.84 %. By means of experiments and DFT calculations, it is revealed that the oxygen vacancy-anchored single-atom Fe can effectively adsorb and activate chemical inert N2 molecules, lowering the energy barrier for the vital breakage of N≡N and resulting in the enhanced N2 fixation performance.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202003518
Highly Productive Electrosynthesis of Ammonia by Admolecule-Targeting Single Ag Sites,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.The ambient electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising alternative to the Haber-Bosch process for producing NH3. However, a guideless search for single-atom-based and other electrocatalysts cannot promote the NH3 yield rates by NRR efficiently. Herein, our first-principles calculations reveal that the successive emergence of vertical end-on *N2 and oblique end-on *NNH admolecules on single metal sites is key to high-performance NRR. By targeting the admolecules, single Ag sites with the Ag-N4 coordination are found and synthesized massively. They exhibit a record-high NH3 yield rate (270.9 μg h-1 mgcat.-1 or 69.4 mg h-1 mgAg-1) and a desirable Faradaic efficiency (21.9%) in HCl aqueous solution under ambient conditions. The generation rate of NH3 is stable during 20 consecutive reaction cycles, and the reduction current density is almost constant for 60 h. This work provides an effective targeting-design principle to purposefully synthesize active and durable single-atom-based NRR electrocatalysts.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.0c01340
Carbon aerogels with atomic dispersion of binary iron-cobalt sites as effective oxygen catalysts for flexible zinc-air batteries,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Iron single atom catalysts have emerged as one of the most active electrocatalysts towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but the unsatisfactory durability and limited activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has hampered their commercial applications in rechargeable metal-air batteries. By contrast, cobalt-based catalysts are known to afford excellent ORR stability and OER activity, due to the weak Fenton reaction and low OER Gibbs free energy. Herein, a bimetal hydrogel template is used to prepare carbon aerogels containing Fe-Co bimetal sites (NCAG/Fe-Co) as bifunctional electrocatalysts towards both ORR and OER, with enhanced activity and stability, as compared to the monometal counterparts. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, elemental mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements demonstrate homogeneous distributions of the metal centers within defected carbon lattices by coordination to nitrogen dopants. X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements, in combination with other results, suggest the formation of FeN3 and CoN3 moieties on mutually orthogonal planes with a direct Fe-Co bonding interaction. Electrochemical measurements show that NCAG/Fe-Co delivers a small ORR/OER potential gap of only 0.64 V at the current density of 10 mA cm-2, 60 mV lower than that (0.70 V) with commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. When applied in a flexible Zn-air battery, the dual-metal NCAG/Fe-Co catalyst also shows a remarkable performance, with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.47 V, a maximum power density of 117 mW cm-2, as well as good rechargeability and flexibility. Results from this study may offer an ingenious protocol in the design and engineering of highly efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts based on dual metal-doped carbons.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta04633g

However, it remains a grand challenge to efficiently produce NH3 in a large scale due to the low activity and poor selectivity of the current electrocatalysts. Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we systematically explored the great potential of two-dimensional (2D) single-atom catalysts (SACs), namely carbon-based iron-nitrogen systems (Fe@Nx, x = 0–4), for N2 electroreduction. Significantly, the catalytic activity and selectivity of Fe@Nx systems are influenced by the coordination environment of single Fe atom. Among all the proposed configurations, Fe@N2-opp, in which two N atoms are located at the opposite coordination sites of single Fe atom, exhibits the highest activity and selectivity for N2 electroreduction, with a limiting potential of −0.63 V. By examining the scaling relations for the single vacancy and double vacancy-based SACs, we constructed a volcano plot to describe the catalytic activity of carbon-based SACs and proposed an optimal nitrogen adsorption energy for N2 electroreduction. This work calls for more attention to the coordination effect to the single-atom active site, and helps provide guidance for further developing more effective carbon-based SACs for N2 fixation.",Catalysis Today,10.1016/j.cattod.2019.06.014
Removing the barrier to water dissociation on single-atom Pt sites decorated with a CoP mesoporous nanosheet array to achieve improved hydrogen evolution,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution has attracted considerable interest, but it is limited by the kinetically sluggish water dissociation step. Herein, we report single-atom Pt immobilized in the lattice of CoP mesoporous nanosheets (MNSs) grown on carbon fiber cloth (CFC) (Ptat-CoP MNSs/CFC) with ultralow Pt loading (0.7 wt% relative to CoP, 5.89 μg cmgeo−2) as a high-performance electrocatalyst for the HER in alkaline solution. Assisted by the strong interaction between Ptatand CoP, water dissociation becomes spontaneous, providing Ptat-CoP MNSs/CFC with a low HER kinetic barrier. Accordingly, Ptat-CoP MNSs/CFC exhibits outstanding HER performance with negligible onset potential, super high catalytic activity, and excellent durability that is even superior to the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, Ptat-CoP MNSs/CFC exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability toward seawater electrolysis.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta02936j
Hierarchically micro- and meso-porous Fe-N4O-doped carbon as robust electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a potentially useful step in energy storage and greenhouse gas alleviation. Here we demonstrate for the first time a Fe-N4O-doped nanoporous carbon as robust electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction, where the five-coordinated Fe-N4O structure works as catalytically active site. It exhibits a high faradaic efficiency of 96 % towards CO with partial current density of -5.4 mA cm−2 at low overpotential of 470 mV. First-principles density functional theory calculations reveal that the free energy barrier for *CO desorption is greatly reduced on Fe-N4O site compared to Fe-N4, resulting in a higher selectivity to CO for a wider electrochemical window. This work opens up new possibilities for improving the catalytic performance of metal-N-C electrocatalysts by regulating the co-ordination of metal atom.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118630

Further improvement on the ORR activity is highly desired in order to replace Pt/C in acidic media. Herein, we developed a new-type of single-atom Fe-N-C electrocatalyst, in which Fe-Nx active sites were modified by P atoms. The half-wave potential of the optimized material reached 0.858 V, which is 23 mV higher than that of the pristine one in a 0.1 mol L−1 HClO4 solution.

Implanting Isolated Ru Atoms into Edge-Rich Carbon Matrix for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAlthough the maximized dispersion of metal atoms has been realized in the single-atom catalysts, further improving the intrinsic activity of the catalysts is of vital importance. Here, the decoration of isolated Ru atoms into an edge-rich carbon matrix is reported for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. The developed catalyst displays high catalytic performance with low overpotentials of 63 and 102 mV for achieving the current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. Its mass activity is about 9.6 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C-20% catalyst at an overpotential of 100 mV. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations suggest that the edges in the carbon matrix enhance the local electric field at the Ru site and accelerate the reaction kinetics for the hydrogen evolution. The present work may provide insights into electrocatalytic behavior and guide the design of advanced electrocatalysts.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202000882
"Atomically Dispersed Fe on Nanosheet-linked, Defect-rich, Highly N-Doped 3D Porous Carbon for Efficient Oxygen Reduction","© 2020, Jilin University, The Editorial Department of Chemical Research in Chinese Universities and Springer-Verlag GmbH.Exploring cost-effective and high-performance oxygen reduction reaction(ORR) electrocatalysts to replace precious platinum-based materials is crucial for developing electrochemical energy conversion devices but remains a great challenge. Herein, Fe single atoms anchored on nanosheet-linked, defect-rich, highly N-doped 3D porous carbon(Fe-SAs/NLPC) electrocatalysts were obtained by pyrolyzing salt-sealed Fe-doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks(ZIFs). NaCl functions both as pore-forming agent and closed nanoreactor, which can not only lead to the formation of defects-rich three-dimensional interconnected structures with high N-doping content to expose abundant active sites, promote mass transfer and electron transfer, but also facilitate the effective incorporation of Fe to form Fe-Nx active sites without aggregation. These unique characteristics render Fe-SAs/NLPC outstanding electrocatalytic activity for ORR, with one-set potential of 0.96 V and high kinetic current density(jK) of 33.32 mA/cm2 in alkaline medium, which surpass the values of most nonprecious-metal catalysts and even commercial Pt/C.",Chemical Research in Chinese Universities,10.1007/s40242-020-0101-7
Facile grafting strategy synthesis of single-atom electrocatalyst with enhanced ORR performance,"© 2020, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have become one of the most considered research directions today, owing to their maximum atom utilization and simple structures, to investigate structure-activity relationships. In the field of non-precious-metal electrocatalysts, atomically dispersed Fe-N4 active sites have been proven to possess the best oxygen reduction activity. Yet the majority of preparation methods remains complex and costly with unsatisfying controllability. Herein, we have designed a surface-grafting strategy to directly synthesize an atomically dispersed Fe-NVC electrocatalyst applied to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Through an esterification process in organic solution, metal-containing precursors were anchored on the surface of carbon substrates. The covalent bonding effect could suppress the formation of aggregated particles during heat treatment. Melamine was further introduced as both a cost-effective nitrogen resource and blocking agent retarding the migration of metal atoms. The optimized catalyst has proven to have abundant atomically dispersed Fe-N4 active sites with enhanced ORR catalytic performance in acid condition. This method has provided new feasible ideas for the synthesis of SACs. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano Research,10.1007/s12274-020-2768-y
Atomically Dispersed Single Ni Site Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction toward Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis Using N2 and H2O,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAmmonia (NH3) electrosynthesis gains significant attention as NH3 is essentially important for fertilizer production and fuel utilization. However, electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) remains a great challenge because of low activity and poor selectivity. Herein, a new class of atomically dispersed Ni site electrocatalyst is reported, which exhibits the optimal NH3 yield of 115 µg cm−2 h−1 at –0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under neutral conditions. High faradic efficiency of 21 ± 1.9% is achieved at -0.2 V versus RHE under alkaline conditions, although the ammonia yield is lower. The Ni sites are stabilized with nitrogen, which is verified by advanced X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electron microscopy. Density functional theory calculations provide insightful understanding on the possible structure of active sites, relevant reaction pathways, and confirm that the Ni-N3 sites are responsible for the experimentally observed activity and selectivity. Extensive controls strongly suggest that the atomically dispersed NiN3 site-rich catalyst provides more intrinsically active sites than those in N-doped carbon, instead of possible environmental contamination. This work further indicates that single-metal site catalysts with optimal nitrogen coordination is very promising for NRR and indeed improves the scaling relationship of transition metals.",Small Methods,10.1002/smtd.201900821
Influence of metal nuclearity and physicochemical properties of ceria on the oxidation of carbon monoxide,"© 2020 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of SciencesThe redox properties of ceria make it suitable as a catalyst or support in oxidation reactions. Ceria-supported transition metal nanoparticles or isolated single atoms provide a metal-support interface that reduces the energy cost to remove interfacial oxygen atoms, providing active oxygen species that can participate in Mars van Krevelen oxidation processes. CO oxidation is a key probe reaction to test the reducibility of ceria-supported catalysts and is also practically important in the elimination of CO at relatively low temperatures in various applications. Preferential oxidation of CO (PROX) in excess H2 controls the CO concentration to ultra-low levels to prevent poisoning of hydrogen oxidation electrocatalysts. The reactivity of catalysts in CO oxidation and selectivity towards CO over H2 in PROX is dependent on the type and dispersion of metal species, the structural and chemical properties of CeO2, and the synthetic preparation methods of the catalysts. In this review, we summarize recently published works on catalytic CO oxidation and PROX reactions on ceria-supported metal nanoparticles and single atoms. We summarize the reactivity on different supported metals, and on different CeO2 surfaces with the same metal. We summarize the most likely reaction mechanisms as suggested by density functional theory calculations. The factors contributing to selectivity towards CO oxidation in PROX reactions on various supported metals are also discussed.",Chinese Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/S1872-2067(20)63557-4
"Designing Efficient Dual-Metal Single-Atom Electrocatalyst TMZnN6(TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) for Oxygen Reduction Reaction","© 2020 American Chemical Society.TMN4 moiety (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.)-based carbon structures have been demonstrated to be highly promising electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. However, applying them in acidic proton-exchange membrane fuel cells remains a significant challenge because of their low efficiency. Herein, we rationally design efficient dual-metal single atom ORR electrocatalysts based on TMZnN6 (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) moiety in acid by density-functional theory calculations. The results show that NiZnN6 and CuZnN6 show the potential application in ORR, which lies in the favorable end-on O2 adsorption way. After considering the *OH as the modifying ligand, CoZnN6(OH) and NiZnN6(OH) display excellent ORR performance with the limiting overpotential 0.47 and 0.41 eV, which is lower than on Pt(111) (0.48 V), showing potential alternatives for Pt/C. Importantly, changing transition-metal atoms would lead to distinct catalytic performances, perhaps reaching the top of the volcano curve [In(kTM/kCu) vs Î""G*O)], and it will help in obtaining the best ORR electrocatalyst. This 2D monolayer can be extended to other electrocatalysts, that is, it can be used in N2 or CO2 reduction or H2 or O2 evolution.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c01045
Exceeding the volcano relationship in oxygen reduction/evolution reactions using single-atom-based catalysts with dual-active-sites,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Finding cost-effective catalysts to drive oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) is a highly attractive goal. Most catalysts follow a volcano relationship of performance, making it difficult to search thoroughly enough among the huge number of possible structures to reach the volcano apex. Using first-principles simulations, we demonstrated that the design of single-atom-based catalysts (SACs) incorporating dual-active-sites breaks the universal scaling relationship between ∗OOH and ∗OH adsorption, leading to performances superior to those constrained to follow the volcano plot. Both a linear OER activity trend that reaches an ideal 0 V overpotential and a new linear scaling relation (free energy difference ΔGOOH = ΔGOH + 2.41 eV) that crosses the region of optimal limiting potentials in the volcano plot of the ORR are associated with our dual-active-site designs. This novel strategy of breaking the volcano dependence with dual-active-sites in SACs may promote the development of efficient electrocatalysts for the ORR/OER and other chemical reactions.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta01399d
Single-Atom Cobalt Catalysts for Electrocatalytic Hydrodechlorination and Oxygen Reduction Reaction for the Degradation of Chlorinated Organic Compounds,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Electrochemical reduction-oxidation processes with the aid of cathode catalysts are promising technologies for the decomposition of organic compounds. High-efficiency and low-cost catalysts for electrochemical reductive dechlorination and two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are vital to the overall degradation of chlorinated organic compounds. This study reports electrochemical dechlorination using a single-atom Co-loaded sulfide graphene (Co-SG) catalyst via atomic hydrogen generated from the electrochemical reduction of H2O and electrolysis of hydrogen. The Co-SG electrocatalyst exhibited a remarkable performance for H2O2 synthesis with a half-wave potential of 0.70 V (vs RHE) and selectivity over 90%. The high electrochemical performance was achieved for bifunctional electrocatalysis with regard to the smaller overpotentials, faster kinetics, and higher cycling stability compared to the noble metal-based electrocatalysts. In this study, 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid was well degraded and the TOC concentration was effectively reduced. This work introduces the preparation of a new active site for high-performance single-atom catalysts and also promotes its application in the electrochemical degradation of chlorinated organic pollutants.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c05159
A new strategy for engineering a hierarchical porous carbon-anchored Fe single-atom electrocatalyst and the insights into its bifunctional catalysis for flexible rechargeable Zn-air batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) provide the most efficient metal utilization for various catalytic reactions. Meanwhile, hierarchical pore structures play a decisive role in determining the catalytic activity of N-doped porous carbon materials, since normally micropores provide active locations and macro/mesopores serve as mass transport channels. However, it remains challenging to engineer highly dispersed SACs with hierarchical pore structures due to the complexity in synthesizing extra templates with controlled sizes and the possible exogenous impurities from templates. Herein, we develop a facile “confined recrystallization” self-template strategy to synthesize a hierarchical porous Fe SAC on N-doped carbon (Fe-NC SAC) with an iron mass loading of 1.5 wt%, by using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), ferric nitrate and melamine. In this novel strategy, the introduced PVP can restrict the recrystallization of ferric nitrate owing to its large molecular weight. The formed nano-sized ferric nitrate crystals can not only serve as multifunctional self-templates to produce hierarchical pores, but also form atomically dispersed Fe-Nxsites through getting nitrogen from melamine. With the Fe-NC SAC as the catalyst, an excellent bifunctional ORR/OER performance and long-term durability superior to those of Pt/C and RuO2are achieved in both liquid and solid Zn-air battery tests. Notably, in the flexible solid Zn-air battery, the Fe-NC SAC showed a high discharge voltage of 1.25 V and stable charge-discharge cycling at 1 mA cm-2under different bending conditions. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the ORR follows the association mechanism of O2? *OOH ? *O ? *OH ? OH-, while the OER goes on through the mechanism of OH-? *OH-? *O ? *OOH ? O2, with a low theoretical overpotential of 1.21 V on the Fe-NC SAC. This work not only provides a novel strategy to endow SACs with a hierarchical pore structure, but also represents an example of how to effectively investigate the correlation between the structure and catalytic activity of catalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta03457f
Engineering Local and Global Structures of Single Co Atoms for a Superior Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.The ability to tune both local and global environments of a single-metal active center on a support is crucial for the development of highly robust and efficient single-atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) that can surmount both thermodynamic and kinetic constraints in electrocatalysis. Here, we designed a core-shell-structured SAEC (Co1-SAC) with superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. Co1-SAC consists of a locally engineered single Co-N3C1 site on a N-doped microporous amorphous carbon support enveloped by a globally engineered highly conductive mesoporous graphitic carbon shell. Theoretical calculations reveal that Co-N3C1 exhibits near-Fermi electronic states distinct from those of Co-N2C2 and Co-N4, which facilitate both the electronic hybridization with O2 and the subsequent protonation of adsorbed O2∗ toward the formation of OOH*. Engineering Co-N3C1-SAC into a micro/mesoporous core-shell structure dramatically enhances the mass transport and electron transfer, which further boosts the ORR and Zn-air battery performance (slightly outperforming Pt/C). Our findings open an avenue toward engineering of the local and global environment of SACs for a wide range of efficient electrochemical conversions.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.0c00936
A DFT screening of single transition atoms supported on MoS2 as highly efficient electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction,"The development of low-cost and highly efficient materials for the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is an attractive and challenging topic in chemistry. In this study, the electrocatalytic performance of a series of transition metal (TM) atoms supported on MoS2 nanosheets (TM@MoS2) was systematically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was found that Re supported on MoS2 (Re@MoS2) has the best NRR catalytic activity with a limiting potential of -0.43 V, along with high selectivity over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at 500 K and density of states (DOS) calculations indicated the high thermodynamic stability and excellent electrical conductivity of Re@MoS2. A linear trend between several parameters of single atom catalysts (SACs) and the adsorption Gibbs free energy change of the NH species (ΔG*NH) was observed, indicating the later as a simple descriptor for the facilitated screening of novel SACs. These results pave the way for exploring novel, highly efficient electrocatalysts for the electrochemical NRR under ambient conditions.",Nanoscale,10.1039/d0nr00030b
Computational Design of Transition Metal Single-Atom Electrocatalysts on PtS2 for Efficient Nitrogen Reduction,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction is promising to serve as a sustainable and environmentally friendly strategy to achieve ammonia production. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) hold great promise to convert N2 into NH3 because of the unique molecular catalysis property and ultrahigh atomic utilization ratio. Here, we demonstrate a universal computational design principle to assess the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) performance of SACs anchored on a monolayer PtS2 substrate (SACs-PtS2). Our density functional theory simulations unveil that the barriers of the NRR limiting potential step on different SAC centers are observed to be linearly correlated to the integral of unoccupied d states (UDSs) of SACs. As a result, the Ru SAC-PtS2 catalyst with the largest number of UDSs exhibits a much lower barrier of the limiting step than those of other SACs-PtS2 catalysts and the Ru(0001) benchmark. Our work bridges the apparent NRR activity and intrinsic electronic structure of SAC centers and offers effective guidance to screen and design efficient SACs for the electrochemical NRR process.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c02458

Herein, the catalytic performance of holey g-CN supported SACs (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are evaluated. Co1/g-CN and Ni1/g-CN are identified as the most efficient bifunctional single atom catalysts for overall water splitting, capable of driving HER/OER simultaneously with overpotentials being as low as 0.15/0.61 V and 0.12/0.40 V, outperforming the commercial Pt and IrO2. Remarkably, the d band centers of TM atoms can act as an efficient descriptor for the interaction strength between intermediates and TM/g-CN, which can be tuned to further optimize the catalytic activity.

KGaA, WeinheimSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) are a frontier research topic in the catalysis community. Carbon materials decorated with atomically dispersed Ti are theoretically predicted with many attractive applications. However, such material has not been achieved so far. Herein, a Ti-based SAC, consisting of isolated Ti anchored by oxygen atoms on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (termed as Ti1/rGO), is successfully synthesized. The structure of Ti1/rGO is characterized by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, being determined to have a five coordinated local structure TiO5. When serving as non-Pt cathode material in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), Ti1/rGO exhibits high electrocatalytic activity toward the tri-iodide reduction reaction. The power conversion efficiency of DSCs based on Ti1/rGO is comparable to that using conventional Pt cathode. The unique structure of TiO5 moieties and the crucial role of atomically dispersed Ti in Ti1/rGO are well understood by experiments and density functional theory calculations.

Single-atom Rh/N-doped carbon electrocatalyst for formic acid oxidation,"© 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.To meet the requirements of potential applications, it is of great importance to explore new catalysts for formic acid oxidation that have both ultra-high mass activity and CO resistance. Here, we successfully synthesize atomically dispersed Rh on N-doped carbon (SA-Rh/CN) and discover that SA-Rh/CN exhibits promising electrocatalytic properties for formic acid oxidation. The mass activity shows 28- and 67-fold enhancements compared with state-of-the-art Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively, despite the low activity of Rh/C. Interestingly, SA-Rh/CN exhibits greatly enhanced tolerance to CO poisoning, and Rh atoms in SA-Rh/CN resist sintering after long-term testing, resulting in excellent catalytic stability. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the formate route is more favourable on SA-Rh/CN. According to calculations, the high barrier to produce CO, together with the relatively unfavourable binding with CO, contribute to its CO tolerance.",Nature Nanotechnology,10.1038/s41565-020-0665-x

Atomically dispersed hierarchically ordered porous Fe–N–C electrocatalyst for high performance electrocatalytic oxygen reduction in Zn-Air battery,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdRational design and synthesis of non-precious metal electrocatalysts for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is urgently required. Recently, single atom catalysts (SACs) have sparked intense interests due to their maximum atom utilization efficiency and excellent properties in electrocatalysis. Herein, we reported an efficient ORR electrocatalyst with atomically dispersed FeN4 sites anchored on 3D hierarchically ordered microporous-mesoporous-macroporous nitrogen doped carbon (3DOM Fe–N–C). Owing to the synergism of highly dispersed FeN4 active sites and 3D hierarchically ordered porous architecture, 3DOM Fe–N–C-900, which was obtained via pyrolysis of ferrocene-encapsulated macro-microporous ZIF-8 precursor at 900 °C, exhibited an outstanding ORR activity in both alkaline (E1/2 of 0.875 V) and acid mediums (E1/2 of 0.784 V), as well as superior stability (only changed 2 mV after 10,000 cycles in alkaline medium). Moreover, 3DOM Fe–N–C-900 as ORR catalyst in zinc-air battery achieved a high power density of 235 mW cm−2 and a high specific capacity of 768.3 mAh g−1, exceeding that driven by Pt/C. Our results revealed that the 3D hierarchically porous architecture of electrocatalysts could facilitate mass transport and increase the accessibility of active sites, thus optimizing their performances in ORR.

Supramolecular confinement of single Cu atoms in hydrogel frameworks for oxygen reduction electrocatalysis with high atom utilization,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdSingle-atom catalysis has emerged as a cutting-edge field in heterogeneous catalysis. Considerable efforts have been devoted to developing versatile methodologies for synthesizing single-atom catalysts, however, the main thrust in this field is to fundamentally understand the intricacies of a catalyst and their performance on a specific reaction by complimenting different techniques. Here we demonstrate a supramolecular hydrogel strategy to effectively isolate copper atoms on interconnected carbon fibers as efficient electrocatalysts for the alkaline oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The Cu–N2 coordination state and the atomic dispersion were confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, the atom utilization (ηatom), which is the ratio between Cu(I) sites participating in the catalysis and the total Cu(I) sites available, has been investigated via surface-interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI-SECM) technique. The over 90% atom utilization of the synthesized Cu SACs is very close to the theoretical value (100%) for SACs, implying the proposed supramolecular approach can enable the ultrahigh exposure of Cu sites. The in situ time-resolved titration of SI-SECM and first-principal calculations further support the remarkable ORR activity on isolated Cu–N2 sites.",Materials Today,10.1016/j.mattod.2019.10.006
Role of local coordination in bimetallic sites for oxygen reduction: A theoretical analysis,"© 2019 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesUnderstanding of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanism for single atom catalysts is pivotal for the rational design of non-precious metal cathode materials and the commercialization of fuel cells. Herein, a series of non-precious metal electrocatalysts based on nitrogen-doped bimetallic (Fe and Co) carbide were modeled by density functional theory calculations to predict the corresponding reaction pathways. The study elucidated prior oxygen adsorption on the Fe atom in the dual site and the modifier role of Co atoms to tune the electronic structures of Fe. The reaction activity was highly correlated with the bimetallic center and the coordination environment of the adjacent nitrogen. Interestingly, the pre-adsorption of *OH resulted in the apparent change of metal atoms’ electronic states with the d-band center shifting toward the Fermi level, thereby boosting reaction activity. The result should help promote the fundamental understanding of active sites in ORR catalysts and provide an effective approach to the design of highly efficient ORR catalysts on an atomic scale.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2019.08.009

Ultrahigh-Loading of Ir Single Atoms on NiO Matrix to Dramatically Enhance Oxygen Evolution Reaction,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Engineering single-atom electrocatalysts with high-loading amount holds great promise in energy conversion and storage application. Herein, we report a facile and economical approach to achieve an unprecedented high loading of single Ir atoms, up to ∼18wt%, on the nickel oxide (NiO) matrix as the electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It exhibits an overpotential of 215 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a remarkable OER current density in alkaline electrolyte, surpassing NiO and IrO2 by 57 times and 46 times at 1.49 V vs RHE, respectively. Systematic characterizations, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration-corrected Z-contrast imaging, demonstrate that the Ir atoms are atomically dispersed at the outermost surface of NiO and are stabilized by covalent Ir-O bonding, which induces the isolated Ir atoms to form a favorable ∼4+ oxidation state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the substituted single Ir atom not only serves as the active site for OER but also activates the surface reactivity of NiO, which thus leads to the dramatically improved OER performance. This synthesis method of developing high-loading single-atom catalysts can be extended to other single-atom catalysts and paves the way for industrial applications of single-atom catalysts.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.9b12642

Cobalt single-atoms anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon material (Co SAC) were found to have an extraordinary sensitivity of 11.44 μA ppb-1 with excellent stability and repeatability, which so far is the highest among non-noble metal nanomaterials. Co SAC also exhibited a superior selectivity toward As(III) compared with some bivalent heavy metal ions (HMIs). Combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS), density functional theory (DFT) calculation, and reaction kinetics simulation, we demonstrated that Co single atoms stabilized in N2C2 support serve as active sites to catalyze H3AsO3 reduction via the formation of Co-O hybridization bond, leading to a lower energy barrier, promoting the breakage of As-O bonds. Importantly, the first electron transfer is the rate-limiting step of arsenic reduction and is found to be more favorable on Co-SAC both thermodynamically and kinetically. This work not only expands the potential applicaiton of single-atom catalysts in the detection and treatment of As(III), but also provides atomic-level catalytic insights into HMIs sensing interfaces.",Analytical Chemistry,10.1021/acs.analchem.0c00677
Semi-sacrificial template synthesis of single-atom Ni sites supported on hollow carbon nanospheres for efficient and stable electrochemical CO2 reduction,"© 2020 the Partner Organisations.Facile synthesis of single-atom catalytic sites on various supports for the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted increasing attention. Herein, atomically dispersed Ni species supported on nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres (SA-Ni/N-CS) were fabricated by using a semi-sacrificial template strategy. The obtained SA-Ni/N-CS was employed as an electrocatalyst for the CO2RR. We found that the SA-Ni/N-CS displayed ultra-high efficiency and selectivity for CO2 conversion into CO with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.1%. Moreover, the SA-Ni/N-CS also exhibited an excellent stability with current density and FE maintained over 99% and 95%, respectively, after 24 h of the CO2RR test. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the CO2 activation process with an activation energy barrier of 2.16 eV is the reaction control step when using SA-Ni/N-CS as a CO2RR catalyst. This work will open up the opportunity for the hard-template synthesis of novel single-atom catalysts for application in electrocatalysis, and suggests that promoting the CO2 activation process could be a crucial approach to boosting the CO2RR.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers,10.1039/c9qi01688k
Highly exposed atomic Fe–N active sites within carbon nanorods towards electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdSingle-atom transition-metal-anchored nitrogen-doped carbon (M-N-C) materials show great potential in electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. However, the development of catalysts with high exposure density of M-Nx active sites remains key challenge. Herein, we report an atomically dispersed and highly exposed Fe coordinated to nitrogen (Fe-Nx) active sites doped within carbon nanorods (Fe–N–C) by pyrolysis of sea urchin-like FeOOH-polyaniline (FeOOH-PANI) composite. Results from X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and operando X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra confirmed the atomically dispersed Fe species and indicated the Fe coordinated with four N atoms to form the highly exposed Fe-Nx active sites. Detailed examination of the Fe–N–C electrocatalyst reveals a high selectivity for CO2 reduction, presenting CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 95% with CO partial current density (jCO) of 1.9 mA cm−2 at a relatively low overpotential of 530 mV. The high-performance is a result of the porous structure of catalyst with highly exposed Fe-Nx active sites, as well as the larger specific surface area and electrochemical active surface area. Our work proposes an effective and feasible way to designing M-N-C catalysts for efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.135930
Mesoporous Single-Atom-Doped Graphene-Carbon Nanotube Hybrid: Synthesis and Tunable Electrocatalytic Activity for Oxygen Evolution and Reduction Reactions,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Mesoporous heteroatom-doped carbon-based nanomaterials are very promising as catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. We have developed a one-step catalytic chemical vapor deposition method to grow a highly graphitized graphene nanoflake (GF)-carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid material doped simultaneously with single atoms of N, Co, and Mo (N-Co-Mo-GF/CNT). This high-surface-area material has a mesoporous structure, which facilitates oxygen mass transfer within the catalyst film, and exhibits a high electrocatalytic activity and stability in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) in alkaline media. We have shown that in this metal (M)-N-C catalyst, M (Co, Mo)-C centers are the main sites responsible for OER, while, for ORR, both M and N-C centers synergistically serve as the active sites. We systematically investigated tuning of the ORR and OER activity of the porous catalyst depending on the choice of the underlying substrate. The ORR kinetic current and OER activity for N-Co-Mo-GF/CNT were significantly enhanced when the catalyst was deposited onto a Ni substrate, resulting in an advanced electrocatalytic performance compared to the best bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts reported so far. Using a developed scanning electrochemical microscopy analysis method, we demonstrated that the higher OER reactivity on Ni was attributable to the formation of underlying catalyst/Ni interfacial sites, which are accessible due to the porous, electrolyte-permeable structure of the catalyst.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.0c00352
Atomic Dispersion and Surface Enrichment of Palladium in Nitrogen-Doped Porous Carbon Cages Lead to High-Performance Electrocatalytic Reduction of Oxygen,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Metal-nitrogen-carbon (MNC) nanocomposites have been hailed as promising and efficient electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), due to the formation of MNx coordination moieties. However, MNC hybrids are mostly prepared by pyrolysis of organic precursors along with select metal salts, where part of the MNx sites are inevitably buried in the carbon matrix. This limited accessibility compromises the electrocatalytic performance. Herein, we describe a wet-impregnation procedure by facile thermal refluxing, whereby palladium is atomically dispersed and enriched onto the surface of hollow, nitrogen-doped carbon cages (HNC) forming Pd-N coordination bonds. The obtained Pd-HNC nanocomposites exhibit an ORR activity in alkaline media markedly higher than that of metallic Pd nanoparticles, and the best sample even outperforms commercial Pt/C and relevant Pd-based catalysts reported in the literature. The results suggest that atomic dispersion and surface enrichment of palladium in a carbon matrix may serve as an effective strategy in the fabrication of high-performance ORR electrocatalysts.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c03415
Graphene-Supported Single Nickel Atom Catalyst for Highly Selective and Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Production,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production by electrocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction shows promise as a replacement for energy-intensive anthraquinone oxidation or H2/O2 direct synthesis. Here, we report on graphene-supported Ni single-atom (SA) electrocatalysts, which are synthesized by a simple surfactant-free reduction process with enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability. Unlike conventional Ni nanoparticles or alloy catalysts, the well-dispersed Ni-SA sites lack adjacent Ni atoms. This structure promotes H2O2 production by a two-electron oxygen reduction pathway under an alkaline condition (pH = 13). This catalyst exhibited enhanced H2O2 selectivity (>94%) with a considerable mass activity (2.11 A mgNi -1 at 0.60 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), owing to the presence of oxygen functional groups and isolated Ni sites. Density functional theory calculations provide insights into the role of this catalyst in optimizing the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction pathway with high H2O2 selectivity. This work suggests a new method for controlling reaction pathways in atomically dispersed non-noble catalysts.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c01278
Design and Preparation of Fe-N5 Catalytic Sites in Single-Atom Catalysts for Enhancing the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Fuel Cells,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.There is an urgent need for developing nonprecious metal catalysts to replace Pt-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Atomically dispersed M-Nx/C catalysts have shown promising ORR activity; however, enhancing their performance through modulating their active site structure is still a challenge. In this study, a simple approach was proposed for preparing atomically dispersed iron catalysts embedded in nitrogen- and fluorine-doped porous carbon materials with five-coordinated Fe-N5 sites. The C@PVI-(DFTPP)Fe-800 catalyst, obtained through pyrolysis of a bio-inspired iron porphyrin precursor coordinated with an axial imidazole from the surface of polyvinylimidazole-grafted carbon black at 800 °C under an Ar atmosphere, exhibited a high electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.88 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode for ORR through a four-electron reduction pathway in alkaline media. In addition, an anion-exchange membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with C@PVI-(DFTPP)Fe-800 as the cathode electrocatalyst generated a maximum power density of 0.104 W cm-2 and a current density of 0.317 mA cm-2. X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that a single-atom catalyst (Fe-Nx/C) with an Fe-N5 active site can selectively be obtained; furthermore, the catalyst ORR activity can be tuned using fluorine atom doping through appropriate pre-assembling of the molecular catalyst on a carbon support followed by pyrolysis. This provides an effective strategy to prepare structure-performance-correlated electrocatalysts at the molecular level with a large number of M-Nx active sites for ORR. This method can also be utilized for designing other catalysts.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.9b20711
Impact of electron transfer of atomic metals on adjacent graphyne layers on electrochemical water splitting,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry .Efficient electrocatalysts are needed for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while the influence of electron transfer from the adjacent layer of multilayered electrocatalysts on their catalytic performance is usually neglected. Here, we used the single cobalt atom trapped graphyne catalyst (Co@GY) to study the feasibility of modulating its water-splitting catalytic activity through interfacial electron transfer. A series of Co@GY/transition-metal doped graphyne double-layered structures (Co@GY/GY and Co@GY/TM@GY, TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) are systematically evaluated for water splitting via theoretical computations. The electronic structure analyses of different stacking cases revealed that the atomic metals on the adjacent TM@GY layer remarkably tune the electronic structures of the Co atom in the Co@GY layer. A strong linear correlation between ΔGH∗ and the d band center of the Co atom was found, suggesting that the HER activity on the Co atom can be tailored by adjusting the TM on the adjacent TM@GY layer with different d-electron occupations. The volcano-type trend of OER catalytic performance is obtained to show the best Co@GY/Ni@GY catalyst for the OER with an over-potential of 0.38 V, indicating that higher catalytic performance arises from moderate interfacial electron transfer. These results arouse a re-thinking of the intrinsic activity origins of single-atom catalysts (SACs) and offer a new strategy for the structure designing of SACs.",Nanoscale,10.1039/c9nr10579d
Revealing the oxygen reduction reaction activity origin of single atoms supported on g-C3N4 monolayers: A first-principles study,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Herein, the potential of single transition metal atoms (TM, from Ti to Au) supported on g-C3N4 (TM/g-C3N4) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was investigated by first-principles calculations. It was demonstrated that the TM atoms can remain stable in the cavity of g-C3N4 and interact with the substrate via charge transfer from the TM atoms to g-C3N4. Among all the TM/g-C3N4 samples, Pd/g-C3N4 stands out with a low overpotential of 0.46 V, showing good performance for ORR; thus, it has great potential to replace the noble Pt catalyst. The ORR activity of TM/g-C3N4 is a function of ΔE∗OH (an energy descriptor). Furthermore, the d-band center and ICOHP (electronic structure descriptors) can quantitatively describe the variation trend of ΔE∗OH in addition to Bader charge analysis (a charge transfer descriptor). Considering the number of d orbital electrons and the electronegativity of TM, φ (an intrinsic descriptor) can be applied to predict and reveal the origin of the ORR activity. A bridge from intrinsic characteristics to electronic structures, to charge transfer, to electronic structures and then to adsorption energy has been established, which is conducive to better reveal the ORR activity origin and provide guidance for designing effective ORR electrocatalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta00794c
"Fe3C cluster-promoted single-atom Fe, N doped carbon for oxygen-reduction reaction","© the 2020 Owner Societies.A key challenge in carrying out an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the design of a highly efficient electrocatalyst that must have fast kinetics, low cost and high stability for use in an energy-conversion device (e.g. metal-air batteries). Herein, we developed a platinum-free ORR electrocatalyst with a high surface area and pore volume via a molten salt method along with subsequent KOH activation. The activation treatment not only increases the surface area to 940.8 m2 g-1 by generating lots of pores, but also promotes the formation of uniform Fe3C nanoclusters within the atomic dispersed Fe-Nx carbon matrix in the final material (A-FeNC). A-FeNC displays excellent activity and long-term stability for the ORR in alkaline media, and shows a greater half-wave potential (0.85 V) and faster kinetics toward four-electron ORR as compared to those of 20 wt% Pt/C (0.83 V). As a cathode catalyst for the Zn-air battery, A-FeNC presents a peak power density of 102.2 mW cm-2, higher than that of the Pt/C constructed Zn-air battery (57.2 mW cm-2). The superior ORR catalytic performance of A-FeNC is ascribed to the increased exposure of active sites, active single-atom Fe-N-C centers, and enhancement by Fe3C nanoclusters.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d0cp00109k
Ru-polyoxometalate as a single-atom electrocatalyst for N2 reduction to NH3 with high selectivity at applied voltage: A perspective from DFT studies,"This journal is © 2020 the Owner Societies.Many highly active electrocatalysts for the reduction of N2 to NH3 (NRR) have been synthesized but suffer from poor selectivity. One crucial reason is that the adsorption of hydrogen often dominates at the active centers at applied voltage, which leads to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. This work used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to develop a class of stable polyoxometalate-based electrocatalysts including phosphomolybdic-, phosphotungstic-, silicotungstic-, and silicomolybdic-acid supported Ru single atoms to efficiently catalyze the NRR process with an overpotential lower than 0.25 V. More importantly, phosphomolybdic- and phosphotungstic acid-supported Ru electrocatalysts can achieve high selectivity at applied voltage. This work offers useful insights into designing high-performance polyoxometalate-based electrocatalysts for the NRR.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d0cp00698j
Boosting CO2 Electroreduction to CH4 via Tuning Neighboring Single-Copper Sites,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.We report single-atom Cu catalysts dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon by a nitrogen-coordination strategy. The presence of nitrogen enabled good dispersion and attachment of atomic Cu species on the nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks with Cu-Nx configurations. The Cu doping concentrations and Cu-Nx configurations were well-tuned by the pyrolysis temperature. At a high Cu concentration of 4.9%mol, the distance between neighboring Cu-Nx species was close enough to enable C-C coupling and produce C2H4. In contrast, at Cu concentrations lower than 2.4%mol, the distance between Cu-Nx species was large so that the electrocatalyst favored the formation of CH4 as C1 products. Density functional theory calculations further confirmed the capability of producing C2H4 by two CO intermediates binding on two adjacent Cu-N2 sites, while the isolated Cu-N4, the neighboring Cu-N4, and the isolated Cu-N2 sites led to formation of CH4. Our work demonstrates a facile approach of tuning active Cu sites for CO2 electroreduction to different hydrocarbons.",ACS Energy Letters,10.1021/acsenergylett.0c00018
Accelerated Dinitrogen Electroreduction to Ammonia via Interfacial Polarization Triggered by Single-Atom Protrusions,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) offers a promising low-energy, sustainable ammonia-synthesizing alternative to Haber-Bosch reaction. One roadblock lying in access to high-performance ammonia electrosynthesis emanates from the unsatisfied ability of electrocatalysts to wreck N≡N bond. Here, we report that interfacial polarization is an efficient scenario to enhance N≡N fracture to boost electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, protrusion-shaped Fe single-atom catalysts immobilized onto MoS2 nanosheets engender electric fields to polarize N2. The resultant interfacial polarization fields between Fe-MoS2 and N2 drive the injection of more electrons into N2 antibonding orbitals in a fast manner, leading to a superior ammonia-evolving rate (36.1 ± 3.6 mmol g−1 h−1 or 97.5 ± 6 μg h−1 cm−2) at low applied potential. Similar phenomena are applicable in Co-MoS2, Cu-MoS2, Rh-MoS2, or Ru-MoS2, suggesting the potential universality of our interfacial polarization concept in upgrading wide-scope catalysis. Seeking a green, low-cost, sustainable approach to synthesize ammonia is crucial to society development and human living. A promising candidate is electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction. The insufficient ability of electrocatalysts to split the N≡N bond, however, limits the activity and selectivity. Using interfacial polarization as a conceptually novel strategy to promote N≡N disintegration, high-rate ammonia electrosynthesis up to 36.1 ± 3.6 mmol g−1 h−1 (97.5 ± 6 μg h−1 cm−2) is realized at a low applied potential (−0.2 V versus RHE). This work paves a new way toward replacing Haber-Bosch reaction with ambient ammonia electrosynthesis. Interfacial polarization is reported as a brand new, efficient, and generalizable strategy to accelerate electrocatalytic reduction of N2 to ammonia. The polarization is established by using an electric field to polarize N2. The electric field is triggered by protrusion-like single atoms anchored on MoS2. The interfacial polarization accelerates electron transfer from single atoms to N2 and thus promotes N2 reduction. As a result, ammonia synthesis in an electrochemical flow cell proceeds at a high rate of 36.1 ± 3.6 mmol g−1 h−1.",Chem,10.1016/j.chempr.2020.01.013
Platinum atoms and nanoparticles embedded porous carbons for hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2020 by the authors.Due to the growing demand for energy and imminent environmental issues, hydrogen energy has attracted widespread attention as an alternative to traditional fossil energy. Platinum (Pt) catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a promising technology to produce hydrogen because the consumed electricity can be generated from renewable energy. To overcome the high cost of Pt, one effective strategy is decreasing the Pt nanoparticle (NP) size from submicron to nano-scale or even down to single atom level for effcient interacting water molecules. Herein, atomically dispersed Pt and ultra-fine Pt NPs embedded porous carbons were prepared through the pyrolysis of Pt porphyrin-based conjugated microporous polymer. As-prepared electrocatalyst exhibit high HER activity with overpotential of down to 31 mV at 10 mA cm-2, and mass activity of up to 1.3 A mgPt-1 at overpotential of 100 mV, which is double of commercial Pt/C (0.66 A mgPt-1). Such promising performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the atomically dispersed Pt and ultra-fine Pt NPs. This work provides a new strategy to prepare porous carbons with both atomically dispersed metal active sites and corresponding metal NPs for various electrocatalysis, such as oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction, etc.",Materials,10.3390/ma13071513
Accelerating CO2 Electroreduction to CO Over Pd Single-Atom Catalyst,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value-added chemicals is regarded as one of the promising routes to mitigate CO2 emission. A nitrogen-doped carbon-supported palladium (Pd) single-atom catalyst that can catalyze CO2 into CO with far higher mass activity than its Pd nanoparticle counterpart, for example, 373.0 and 28.5 mA mg−1 Pd, respectively, at −0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, is reported. A combination of in situ X-ray characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the PdN4 site is the most likely active center for CO production without the formation of palladium hydride (PdH), which is essential for typical Pd nanoparticle catalysts. Furthermore, the well-dispersed PdN4 single-atom site facilitates the stabilization of the adsorbed CO2 intermediate, thereby enhancing electrocatalytic CO2 reduction capability at low overpotentials. This work provides important insights into the structure-activity relationship for single-atom based electrocatalysts.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202000407
Atomic-level tuning of Co–N–C catalyst for high-performance electrochemical H2O2 production,"© 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.Despite the growing demand for hydrogen peroxide it is almost exclusively manufactured by the energy-intensive anthraquinone process. Alternatively, H2O2 can be produced electrochemically via the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction, although the performance of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts is insufficient to meet the demands for industrialization. Interestingly, guided by first-principles calculations, we found that the catalytic properties of the Co–N4 moiety can be tailored by fine-tuning its surrounding atomic configuration to resemble the structure-dependent catalytic properties of metalloenzymes. Using this principle, we designed and synthesized a single-atom electrocatalyst that comprises an optimized Co–N4 moiety incorporated in nitrogen-doped graphene for H2O2 production and exhibits a kinetic current density of 2.8 mA cm−2 (at 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) and a mass activity of 155 A g−1 (at 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) with negligible activity loss over 110 hours.",Nature Materials,10.1038/s41563-019-0571-5
Hierarchically porous carbon with pentagon defects as highly efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions,"© 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Highly dispersed electrocatalysts and single-atom catalysts receive extensive attention in the field of multiple reactions involving water spitting, oxygen reduction, and CO2 reduction. Herein, we develop a Fe/N co-doped hierarchically structured porous carbon (Fe/N/C-DT) by the dual-templating approach, involving the incorporation of ferrocenecarboxaldehyde (Fc–CHO) into the polyimide, followed by carbonization at 900 °C and etching. A steric hindrance offered by the ferrocene and the porosity of the obtained nanostructure prevent the aggregation of Fe atoms, resulting in the maximization of catalytic efficiency of iron-based sites. FeCl2/N/C-DT and FeSO4/N/C-DT using FeCl2 and FeSO4 as iron sources, respectively, are prepared for comparison, to further confirm the potential positive effect of Fc–CHO and explore the synergistic effect of the pentagon defects and Fe–N4 on the catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The prepared Fe/N/C-DT exhibits outstanding electrochemical activity toward ORR (E1/2 = 0.902 V vs RHE) and impressive OER activity (Ej=10 = 1.66 V) in alkaline conditions. The rechargeable Zn–air battery using Fe/N/C-DT as a cathode catalyst shows a peak power density of 220 mW cm−2 and a high open–circuit voltage of 1.451 V in the all-solid-state Zn–air battery.",Journal of Materials Science,10.1007/s10853-019-04327-5
Cobalt Nanoparticles and Atomic Sites in Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Frameworks for Highly Sensitive Sensing of Hydrogen Peroxide,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimIn situ monitoring of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) during its production process is needed. Here, an electrochemical H2O2 sensor with a wide linear current response range (concentration: 5 × 10−8 to 5 × 10−2 m), a low detection limit (32.4 × 10−9 m), and a high sensitivity (568.47 µA mm−1 cm−2) is developed. The electrocatalyst of the sensor consists of cobalt nanoparticles and atomic Co-Nx moieties anchored on nitrogen doped carbon nanotube arrays (Co-N/CNT), which is obtained through the pyrolysis of the sandwich-like urea@ZIF-67 complex. More cobalt nanoparticles and atomic Co-Nx as active sites are exposed during pyrolysis, contributing to higher electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, a portable screen-printed electrode sensor is constructed and demonstrated for rapidly detecting (cost ≈40 s) H2O2 produced in microbial fuel cells with only 50 µL solution. Both the synthesis strategy and sensor design can be applied to other energy and environmental fields.",Small,10.1002/smll.201902860
A general bimetal-ion adsorption strategy to prepare nickel single atom catalysts anchored on graphene for efficient oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2019 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) supported on two-dimensional (2D) materials are highly attractive for maximizing their catalytic activity. However, graphene based SACs are primarily bonded with nitrogen and carbon sites, resulting in poor performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we develop a general bimetal-ion adsorption strategy for the synthesis of individually dispersed Ni SACs anchored on the oxygenated sites of ultrathin reduced graphene oxide as efficient OER electrocatalysts. The resultant Ni SACs for OER in alkaline electrolyte exhibit a highly stable overpotential of 328 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, and Tafel slope of 84 mV dec−1 together with long-term durability and negligible degradation for 50 h, which is greatly outperform its counterparts of nitrogen bonded Ni SACs (564 mV, 364 mV dec−1) and Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles anchored on graphene (450 mV, 142 mV dec−1), and most reported Ni based OER electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the extended X-ray absorption fine structure at the Ni K-edge and theoretical simulation reveal that the nickel-oxygen coordination significantly boost OER performance. Therefore, this work will open numerous opportunities for creating novel-type 2D SACs via oxygen–metal bonding as highly robust OER catalysts.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2019.08.006
FeN: X and γ-Fe2O3 co-functionalized hollow graphitic carbon nanofibers for efficient oxygen reduction in an alkaline medium,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.The exploration of efficient, stable, and inexpensive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts to replace Pt/C in fuel cells and metal-air batteries still remains an ongoing challenge. Herein, we report an efficient ORR electrocatalyst composed of single-atom FeNx and γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticle co-functionalized hollow graphitic carbon nanofibers (FeNx/Fe2O3-CNFs). It is found that the FeNx species serve as the active sites, while the γ-Fe2O3 nanocrystals function as a co-catalyst to boost the ORR catalytic activity. The obtained FeNx/Fe2O3-CNFs exhibit desirable ORR electrocatalytic activity with a 4-electron transfer pathway, a half-wave potential of 0.81 V approaching that of commercial Pt/C, low hydrogen peroxide yields (<6% at 0.2-0.7 V), long-term stability (87.14% after 30 000 s), and excellent methanol tolerance.

Unveiling the Active Structure of Single Nickel Atom Catalysis: Critical Roles of Charge Capacity and Hydrogen Bonding,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.A single nickel atom embedded in graphene is one of the most representative single-atom catalysts, and it has a high activity and selectivity for electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to CO. However, the catalytic origin, especially the coordination structure of Ni, remains highly puzzling, as previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that all the possible structures should be inactive and/or nonselective. Here, using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and a ""slow-growth"" sampling approach to evaluate the reaction kinetic barriers, we show that the charge capacity (of the site) and hydrogen bonding (with the intermediates), which were neglected/oversimplified in previous DFT calculations, play crucial roles, and including their effects can resolve the catalytic origin. Particularly, a high charge capacity allows the catalytic site to carry more charges than required for the electrochemical step, lowering the electrochemical barrier, and hydrogen bonding promotes the reaction that produces polar intermediates by stabilizing the intermediates and facilitating the H transfer from water, explaining the high selectivity for CO2R over the hydrogen evolution reaction. Consequently, we find that a hybrid coordination environment (with one nitrogen and three carbon atoms) for the Ni-atom is most active and selective for CO2R. Our work not only explains a long-standing puzzle for an important catalyst but also highlights the crucial roles of charge capacity and hydrogen bonding, which can help elucidate the mechanisms of other heterogeneous electrocatalysts in aqueous solution and enable more effective catalyst design.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.9b13872
Preparation of Nonprecious Metal Electrocatalysts for the Reduction of Oxygen Using a Low-Temperature Sacrificial Metal,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are generally composed of iron, nitrogen, and carbon synthesized through high-temperature pyrolysis. Among the various types of precursors, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-8 in particular, have often been used in the synthesis. The pyrolysis of ZIF-8 precursor relies on the use of Zn as a sacrificial metal (SM), and the optimal processing temperatures often exceed 1000 °C to generate active non-PGM catalysts. The high pyrolysis temperature tends to result in heterogeneous active moieties ranging from Fe single atoms to nanoparticles. In this study, we present the synthesis of non-PGM catalysts using Cd as the sacrificial metal instead of Zn. By using Cd, we were able to generate active non-PGM electrocatalysts from the MOF precursors at a low pyrolysis temperature of 750 °C, which helps preserve the single atomic iron active sites.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.9b11061
Construction of Active Orbital via Single-Atom Cobalt Anchoring on the Surface of 1T-MoS2 Basal Plane toward Efficient Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Endowing the basal plane of metallic MoS2 with highly active catalytic sites is one strategy to promote its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic performance. Since there is unsuitable orbital orientation at the Fermi energy level, the activity of HER for the perfect basal plane in metallic 1T phase MoS2 (1T-MoS2) is insufficient. Herein, we resolved this issue through a single-atom cobalt-introduced active orbital. The prepared cobalt (Co)-doped 1T-MoS2 displays a significantly enhanced HER activity. The overpotential at 10 mA cm-2 is 84 mV. The Tafel slope is 47 mV dec-1. The results of experiment and theory reveal that the doped Co atoms anchor preferentially on the Mo top sites, acting as active sites and possessing a Gibbs free energy near zero for hydrogen adsorption. Theoretical calculation further reveals that the high activity of Co anchoring on the surface is attributed to the introduction of a dz2 orbital perpendicular to the basal plane around the Fermi level, enabling energetically and sterically favorable hydrogen adsorption/desorption.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c00163
Electrospun single iron atoms dispersed carbon nanofibers as high performance electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction in acid and alkaline media,"© 2019 Elsevier Inc.The metal (Fe/Co), nitrogen co-doped carbon represent an important class of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which can be obtained via the thermal treatment of transition-metal macrocycles (TMMs). However, the N4-chelate complex with metal atom (M-N4) moieties as major activity site for ORR are easily destroyed to form inorganic metal species during simple pyrolysis of TMMs. In this report, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning containing a small amount of hemin (chloroprotoporphyrin IX iron(III), TMMs). The electrospun nanofibers were converted into Fe, N co-doped carbon nanofibers (Fe-N-CNFs) through preoxidized and thermal treatment. The PAN macromolecules can prevent hemin from aggregation during the process of pyrolysis. The Fe elemental mapping demonstrated that Fe species probably existed in a single atom state. The Fe K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectrum of Fe-N-CNFs proved that the Fe-N4 moieties have been successfully reserved. The X-ray photoelectron spectra of Fe-N-CNFs indicated that the amount of Fe-N4 moieties increased with the increased percent of hemin. Therefore, the Fe-N-CNFs exhibited the higher catalytic activity for ORR compared with Pt electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the Fe1-N-CNFs displayed higher stability and methanol tolerance than Pt/C.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2019.12.120
Directly predicting limiting potentials from easily obtainable physical properties of graphene-supported single-Atom electrocatalysts by machine learning,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are three critical reactions for energy-related applications, such as water electrolyzers and metal-Air batteries. Graphene-supported single-Atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely explored; however, either experiments or density functional theory (DFT) computations cannot screen catalysts at high speed. Herein, based on DFT computations of 104 graphene-supported SACs (M@C3, M@C4, M@pyridine-N4, and M@pyrrole-N4), we built machine learning (ML) models to describe the underlying pattern of easily obtainable physical properties and limiting potentials (mean square errors = 0.027/0.021/0.035 V for the ORR/OER/HER, respectively) and employed these models to predict the catalytic performance of 260 other graphene-supported SACs containing metal-NxCy active sites (M@NxCy). We recomputed the top catalysts recommended by ML towards the ORR/OER/HER by DFT, which confirmed the reliability of our ML model, and identified two OER catalysts (Ir@pyridine-N3C1 and Ir@pyridine-N2C2) outperforming noble metal oxides, RuO2 and IrO2. The ML models quantitatively unveiled the significance of various descriptors and quickly narrowed down the candidate list of graphene-supported single-Atom catalysts. This approach can be easily used to screen and design other SACs and significantly accelerate the catalyst design for many other important reactions.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta13404b
The single-Mo-atom-embedded-graphdiyne monolayer with ultra-low onset potential as high efficient electrocatalyst for N2 reduction reaction,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The production of ammonia (NH3) at ambient conditions has always faced enormous challenges in chemical industry. In this study, the potential of the electrocatalysts of transition-metal-embedded (TM = Sc, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd and Ag) graphdiyne monolayer (TM@GDY) has been systematically investigated as nitrogen (N2) Reduction Reaction (NRR) by Density Functional Theory (DFT). The results reveal that Mo-embedded graphdiyne monolayer (Mo@GDY) has high stability, high electrical conductivity and excellent catalytic activity with ultra-low onset potential (−0.33 V) by distal mechanism. The ultra-low onset potential is attributed to much stronger interactions between hydrogen and the next nearest nitrogen atoms (H-N2) for the distal mechanism compared with the enzymatic mechanism (−1.03 V) during the first hydrogenation. Moreover, Mo@GDY can also effectively suppress the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) during the entire NRR process. This study may provide a new approach for electrochemical N2 reduction to form NH3 at ambient conditions.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.144941
Machine learning-based high throughput screening for nitrogen fixation on boron-doped single atom catalysts,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.Production of ammonia via electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has recently attracted much attention due to its potential to play a vital role in producing fertilizers and other chemicals. High throughput screening of electrocatalysts for the NRR requires numerous calculations in the search space, making the computational cost a bottleneck for predicting eligible electrocatalysts. Here we used a deep neural network (DNN) to predict efficient electrocatalysts for the NRR among boron(B)-doped graphene single atom catalysts (SACs). This model can noticeably reduce the time of computation by removing non-efficient catalysts from screening. Also, the adsorption energy and free energy can be predicted by the feature-based light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) model. These features represent the geometrical structure as well as bonding characteristics. Among the catalysts evaluated, three candidates were identified as very promising catalysts, offering excellent selectivity over the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). CrB3C1 exhibited a minimal overpotential of 0.13 V for the NRR. This study provides a new pathway for the rational design of catalysts for nitrogen fixation by employing the most important features involved in the NRR by using machine learning methods.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta12608b
Enabling Direct H2O2 Production in Acidic Media through Rational Design of Transition Metal Single Atom Catalyst,"© 2019Hydrogen peroxide is a valuable chemical with extensive applications, but the current industrial production method is energy-intensive and generates substantial waste. The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media offers an attractive route for direct hydrogen peroxide generation and on-site applications. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of cost-effective electrocatalysts with high catalytic performance. Here, by combining theoretical calculations and experimental methods, we demonstrate that an atomically dispersed cobalt anchored in nitrogen-doped carbon can function as a highly active and selective electrocatalyst for direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis. This cobalt single-atom catalyst combines the advantages of both homogeneous catalysts of cobalt macrocycles (well-defined active sites) and heterogeneous metal-nitrogen-carbon catalysts (high catalytic performance) together, showing promising application in electrosynthesis device. © 2019By combining theoretical and experimental methods, Gao et al. systematically studied the relationship between the structure of transition metal (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) single-atom catalyst anchored in nitrogen-doped graphene and the catalytic performance of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis via electrochemical two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) (2e− ORR). The thus designed Co single-atom catalyst can function as a highly active and selective catalyst for H2O2 synthesis and even slightly outperforms state-of-the-art noble-metal-based electrocatalysts in acidic media. © 2019The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media offers an attractive route for direct hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation and on-site applications. Unfortunately there is still a lack of cost-effective electrocatalysts with high catalytic performance. Here, we theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated that a cobalt single-atom catalyst (Co SAC) anchored in nitrogen-doped graphene, with optimized adsorption energy of the *OOH intermediate, exhibited a high H2O2 production rate, which even slightly outperformed the state-of-the-art noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. The kinetic current of H2O2 production over Co SAC could reach 1 mA/cmdisk 2 at 0.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 M HClO4 with H2O2 faraday efficiency > 90%, and these performance measures could be sustained for 10 h without decay. Further kinetic analysis and operando X-ray absorption study combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrated that the nitrogen-coordinated single Co atom was the active site and the reaction was rate-limited by the first electron transfer step.",Chem,10.1016/j.chempr.2019.12.008
Robust and Stable Acidic Overall Water Splitting on Ir Single Atoms,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Single-atom electrocatalysts (SAEs) can realize the target of low-cost by maximum atomic efficiency. However, they usually suffer performance decay due to high energy states, especially in a harsh acidic water splitting environment. Here, we conceive and realize a double protecting strategy that ensures robust acidic water splitting on Ir SAEs by dispersing Ir atoms in/onto Fe nanoparticles and embedding IrFe nanoparticles into nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Ir-SA@Fe@NCNT). When Ir-SA@Fe@NCNT acts as a bifunctional electrocatalyst at ultralow Ir loading of 1.14 μg cm-2, the required overpotentials to deliver 10 mA cm-2 are 250 and 26 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte corresponding to 1370- and 61-fold better mass activities than benchmark IrO2 and Pt/C at an overpotential of 270 mV, respectively, resulting in only 1.51 V to drive overall water splitting. Moreover, remarkable stability is also observed compared to Pt/C-IrO2.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c00127
Optimizing Electron Densities of Ni-N-C Complexes by Hybrid Coordination for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimMetal-N-C is a type of attractive electrocatalyst for efficient CO2 reduction to CO. Because of the ambiguity in their atomic structures, the active sites and catalytic mechanisms of the catalysts have remained under debate. Here, the effects of N and C hybrid coordination on the activity of Ni-N-C catalysts were investigated, combining theoretical and experimental methods. The theoretical calculations revealed that N and C hybrid coordination greatly enhanced the capability of single-atom Ni active sites to provide electrons to reactant molecules and strengthens the bonding of Ni to N and C in the Ni-N-C complexes. During the reaction process, the C and N coordination synergistically optimized the reaction energies in the conversion of CO2 to CO. A good agreement between theoretical calculations and electrochemical experiments was achieved based on the newly developed Ni-N-C electrocatalysts. The activity of hybrid-coordination NiN2C2 was more than double that of single-coordination NiN4.",ChemSusChem,10.1002/cssc.201903427
A General Method for Transition Metal Single Atoms Anchored on Honeycomb-Like Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanosheets,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimExcavating and developing highly efficient and cost-effective nonnoble metal single-atom catalysts for electrocatalytic reactions is of paramount significance but still in its infancy. Herein, reported is a general NaCl template-assisted strategy for rationally designing and preparing a series of isolated transition metal single atoms (Fe/Co/Ni) anchored on honeycomb-like nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (M1-HNC-T1-T2, M = Fe/Co/Ni, T1 = 500 °C, T2 = 850 °C). The resulting M1-HNC-500-850 with M-N4 active sites exhibits superior capability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the half-wave potential order of Fe1-HNC-500-850 > Co1-HNC-500-850 > Ni1-HNC-500-850, in which Fe1-HNC-500-850 shows better performance than commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations reveal a choice strategy that the strong p–d-coupled spatial charge separation results the Fe-N4 effectively merges active electrons for elevating d-band activity in a van-Hove singularity like character. This essentially generalizes an optimal electronic exchange-and-transfer (ExT) capability for boosting sluggish alkaline ORR activity. This work not only presents a universal strategy for preparing single-atom electrocatalyst to accelerate the kinetics of cathodic ORR but also provides an insight into the relationship between the electronic structure and the electrocatalytical activity.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.201906905
A Freestanding Flexible Single-Atom Cobalt-Based Multifunctional Interlayer toward Reversible and Durable Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe development of Li-S batteries is greatly hindered by the polysulfide shuttling and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics, leading to low utilization of active materials and rapid capacity decay. Herein, a freestanding multifunctional interlayer, prepared by layer-by-layer assembling of the single-atom cobalt-anchored nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (NC@SA-Co) and dual network of carbon nanotube-cellulose nanofiber (CNT-CNF) hybrid, is proposed to effectively enhance the polysulfide immobilization and sulfur redox kinetics. The conductive CNT network acts as the physical barrier to confine the polysulfide diffusion and to facilitate the reuse of polysulfides. The oxygen-group-terminated CNF network allows the hopping of Li+ ion and suppresses the polysulfide crossover due to the strong electrostatic repulsion. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the 2D NC@SA-Co with numerous well-defined single sites of Co–N4 can effectively serve as an electrocatalyst to boost the reversible reaction of polysulfides. As a result, the assembled Li-S batteries with the multifunctional interlayer deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 1160 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and an ultralow capacity decay of 0.058% per cycle over 700 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading of 7.2 mg cm−2, a high areal capacity of 8.3 mAh cm−2 can be achieved.",Small Methods,10.1002/smtd.201900701
Achieving Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction over a Ni5P4 Catalyst Incorporating Single-Atomic Ru Sites,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimDeveloping efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis is central to substantial progress of alkaline hydrogen production. Herein, a Ni5P4 electrocatalyst incorporating single-atom Ru (Ni5P4-Ru) is synthesized through the filling of Ru3+ species into the metal vacancies of nickel hydroxides and subsequent phosphorization treatment. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray-based measurements, and electron microscopy observations confirm the strong interaction between the nickel-vacancy defect and Ru cation, resulting in more than 3.83 wt% single-atom Ru incorporation in the obtained Ni5P4-Ru. The Ni5P4-Ru as an alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst achieves low onset potential of 17 mV and an overpotential of 54 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 together with a small Tafel slope of 52.0 mV decade-1 and long-term stability. Further spectroscopy analyses combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the doped Ru sites can cause localized structure polarization, which brings the low energy barrier for water dissociation on Ru site and the optimized hydrogen adsorption free energy on the interstitial site, well rationalizing the experimental reactivity.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.201906972
Simultaneously Integrating Single Atomic Cobalt Sites and Co9S8 Nanoparticles into Hollow Carbon Nanotubes as Trifunctional Electrocatalysts for Zn–Air Batteries to Drive Water Splitting,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe development of rechargeable metal–air batteries and water electrolyzers are highly constrained by electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the construction of efficient trifunctional electrocatalysts for ORR/OER/HER are highly desirable yet challenging. Herein, hollow carbon nanotubes integrated single cobalt atoms with Co9S8 nanoparticles (CoSA + Co9S8/HCNT) are fabricated by a straightforward in situ self-sacrificing strategy. The structure of the CoSA + Co9S8/HCNT are verified by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Theoretical calculations and experimental results embrace the synergistic effects between Co9S8 nanoparticles and single cobalt atoms through optimizing the electronic configuration of the CoN4 active sites to lower the reaction barrier and facilitating the ORR, OER, and HER simultaneously. Consequently, rechargeable liquid and all-solid-state flexible Zn–air batteries based on CoSA + Co9S8/HCNT exhibit remarkable stability and excellent power density of 177.33 and 51.85 mW cm−2, respectively, better than Pt/C + RuO2 counterparts. Moreover, the as-fabricated Zn–air batteries can drive an overall water splitting device assembled with CoSA + Co9S8/HCNT and achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low voltage of 1.59 V, also superior to Pt/C + RuO2. Therefore, this work presents a promising approach to an efficient trifunctional electrocatalyst toward practical applications.",Small,10.1002/smll.201906735
Engineering Local Coordination Environments of Atomically Dispersed and Heteroatom-Coordinated Single Metal Site Electrocatalysts for Clean Energy-Conversion,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimCarbon-based heteroatom-coordinated single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising candidates for energy-related electrocatalysts because of their low-cost, tunable catalytic activity/selectivity, and relatively homogeneous morphologies. Unique interactions between single metal sites and their surrounding coordination environments play a significant role in modulating the electronic structure of the metal centers, leading to unusual scaling relationships, new reaction mechanisms, and improved catalytic performance. This review summarizes recent advancements in engineering of the local coordination environment of SACs for improved electrocatalytic performance for several crucial energy-convention electrochemical reactions: oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction. Various engineering strategies including heteroatom-doping, changing the location of SACs on their support, introducing external ligands, and constructing dual metal sites are comprehensively discussed. The controllable synthetic methods and the activity enhancement mechanism of state-of-the-art SACs are also highlighted. Recent achievements in the electronic modification of SACs will provide an understanding of the structure–activity relationship for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201902844
Recent advances in carbon-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2020 The AuthorFuel cells are one of the most promising clean energy devices to substitute for fossil fuel in the future to alleviate energy crisis and environmental pollution. As the key reaction on the cathode in the fuel cells, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) still requires efficient noble metal catalysts such as the commercial Pt/C to boost the reaction for its sluggish kinetics. Therefore, it is critical to design earth-abundant carbon-based catalysts with high efficiency and long-term stability to replace the noble metal-based catalysts. This review focuses on the recent progress about carbon-based ORR catalysts including non-metal doped carbon materials, transition metal-nitrogen-carbon species, transition metal carbides/carbon, single atom catalysts, and other carbon hybrids. And we further infer that the excellent ORR performances can be achieved by the balance of geometric and electronic structures of catalysts such as conductivity, surface area, hierarchical porous structure, defect and doping effect. Additionally, the perspective development trend is also proposed to guide the rational designation of carbon-based catalysts for ORR and even extend to other energy storage and conversion fields in the future.",Chinese Chemical Letters,10.1016/j.cclet.2019.08.008
Single-atom transition metals supported on black phosphorene for electrochemical nitrogen reduction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is one of the most promising routes to produce ammonia under mild conditions. Black phosphorene (BP) has attracted wide attention as an NRR electrocatalyst owing to its high Fermi level and unique electronic structure. However, the low intrinsic activity of surface sites greatly restricts its application in the electrochemical NRR. In this work, we theoretically designed a series of single-atom transition metals anchored on the BP surface with MP3 (M = Fe, Mn, Cr, Mo, W, V and Nb) active sites for the NRR via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By taking stability, activity and selectivity into consideration, the single-atom W-anchored BP was selected as a promising candidate for the NRR. The energy-favorable enzymatic pathway on W@BP (W atoms adsorb on the surface of BP) and the hybrid pathway on W-BP (W atoms substitute the surface P atoms of BP) have reaction onset potentials of 0.46 and 0.42 V, respectively, indicating that the single-atom W-anchored BP shows high activity towards the NRR. This high performance originates from the WP3 active sites, which act as an electron adaptor to activate N2 by donating electrons, thereby greatly regulating the charge transfer between BP and the reaction intermediates. This study proposes a promising active catalyst and provides theoretical guidance to construct BP-supported transition metal single-atom electrocatalysts for the NRR.",Nanoscale,10.1039/c9nr09117c
Tunable Syngas Production through CO2 Electroreduction on Cobalt-Carbon Composite Electrocatalyst,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Controllable concomitant production of CO and H2 (syngas) during electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR) is expected to improve the commercial feasibility of the technology to mitigate CO2 emissions as the generated syngas can be converted into useful chemicals using the commercial Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. Herein, we demonstrate the ability of a Co single-atom-decorated N-doped graphitic carbon shell-encapsulated cobalt nanoparticle electrocatalyst (referred as Co@CoNC-900) to controllably produce syngas at low overpotentials during CO2RR. Through the engineering and modulation of dual active sites for CO2RR (modified carbon shell with encapsulated Co) and hydrogen evolution reaction (Co-N4 moieties) within Co@CoNC by varying the annealing temperature, we are able to tune the H2: CO ratio from 1: 2 to 1: 1 to 3: 2 over a wide range of applied potentials (-0.5 V to -0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). This versatile control of H2: CO ratio in CO2RR reaction brings up significant opportunity of using CO2 and H2O and renewable energy for producing a range of chemicals.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.9b21216
Rational Molecular Design of Electrocatalysts Based on Single-Atom Modified Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.The development of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts comprising abundant elements is highly desirable for achieving widespread use of fuel cells. Optimal ORR catalysts should have moderate binding strength (ΔEads) with O2-derived intermediates, where the metal species and its coordination numbers are the essential determining factors for ΔEads. However, in conventional non-noble-metal-based ORR catalysts, such as metal-nitrogen-doped carbons, the metal species and its coordination structure cannot freely be chosen. In contrast, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which are cross-linked microporous polymers, have high design flexibility; as such, they can be purposefully designed by using a wide range of monomers. The present work investigated the adsorption strength of ORR intermediates on single 3d metal atoms (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) doped in COFs with different coordination structures using first-principles calculations toward the development of efficient non-noble-metal ORR catalysts. The adsorption strength of the intermediates was found to monotonically increase as either the number of d-electrons or coordination number of metal centers decreased, and a volcano-type relationship was observed between the adsorption energies of the intermediates and the theoretical ORR activities. Therefore, to develop efficient non-noble-metal-based ORR electrocatalysts, the adsorption strength should be tuned close to the volcano peak by an appropriate choice of metal species and/or coordination number as the control parameters. Considering the high designability of metal species and of its coordination numbers in COFs, COFs are expected to become the next-generation platform of supports of single-atom catalysts using the design direction provided by the present work.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.9b02141
Stabilizing Single-Atom Iron Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction via Ceria Confining and Trapping,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Atomically dispersed Fe-N-C materials recently hold great interest in costly Pt substitution for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction of fuel cells. However, the heat treatment involved in the material preparation excites Fe aggregating into nanosized species with low activity rather than single-atom Fe sites. Herein, we propose a ""ceria-assisted"" strategy to preferentially generate active single-atom Fe sites in Fe-N-C materials, which involves oxidative polymerization of pyrrole, Ce3+ and Fe3+ adsorption, and subsequent heat treatment. Because of its spatial confinement and strong trapping for Fe atoms, ceria can effectively suppress agglomeration of isolated Fe atoms and stabilize the Fe atoms by bonding to O in the lattice during the heat treatment, leading to a high content of atomically dispersed Fe (4.6 wt »%). Accordingly, the final catalyst showed ultrahigh ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.915 V and kinetic current density of 7.15 mA cm-2 at 0.9 V. When used at the cathode in anion exchange membrane fuel cell, a maximum power density of 496 mW cm-2 was achieved, which is one of the best performance reported in the literature for Fe-N-C-type electrocatalysts.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.9b04621
Electrochemical Conversion of CO2 to Syngas with Controllable CO/H2 Ratios over Co and Ni Single-Atom Catalysts,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to yield synthesis gas (syngas, CO and H2) has been considered as a promising method to realize the net reduction in CO2 emission. However, it is challenging to balance the CO2RR activity and the CO/H2 ratio. To address this issue, nitrogen-doped carbon supported single-atom catalysts are designed as electrocatalysts to produce syngas from CO2RR. While Co and Ni single-atom catalysts are selective in producing H2 and CO, respectively, electrocatalysts containing both Co and Ni show a high syngas evolution (total current >74 mA cm−2) with CO/H2 ratios (0.23–2.26) that are suitable for typical downstream thermochemical reactions. Density functional theory calculations provide insights into the key intermediates on Co and Ni single-atom configurations for the H2 and CO evolution. The results present a useful case on how non-precious transition metal species can maintain high CO2RR activity with tunable CO/H2 ratios.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201912719
Regulating the Coordination Environment of MOF-Templated Single-Atom Nickel Electrocatalysts for Boosting CO2 Reduction,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe general synthesis and control of the coordination environment of single-atom catalysts (SACs) remains a great challenge. Herein, a general host–guest cooperative protection strategy has been developed to construct SACs by introducing polypyrrole (PPy) into a bimetallic metal–organic framework. As an example, the introduction of Mg2+ in MgNi-MOF-74 extends the distance between adjacent Ni atoms; the PPy guests serve as N source to stabilize the isolated Ni atoms during pyrolysis. As a result, a series of single-atom Ni catalysts (named NiSA-Nx-C) with different N coordination numbers have been fabricated by controlling the pyrolysis temperature. Significantly, the NiSA-N2-C catalyst, with the lowest N coordination number, achieves high CO Faradaic efficiency (98 %) and turnover frequency (1622 h−1), far superior to those of NiSA-N3-C and NiSA-N4-C, in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the low N coordination number of single-atom Ni sites in NiSA-N2-C is favorable to the formation of COOH* intermediate and thus accounts for its superior activity.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201914977
Two-dimensional cobalt prussian blue nanosheets: Template-directed synthesis and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution property,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdExploration of novel cost-effective electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and investigation of the effect of structure of electrocatalysts on activity are critical to energy conversion and storage processes. Based on advantage of two-dimensional (2D) structure, in this work, cobalt prussian blue nanosheets (Co-PB-NSs) are designed and synthesized. Theoretically, single-atom layered Co-PB-NSs can provide 100% exposed transition metal catalytic centers toward OER. As a result, the ultrathin 2D structure brings more transition metal active sites to Co-PB-NSs. Meantime, 2D structure is also an effective way to regulate the electronic structure of Co-PB, which is benefit improving conductivity. More interestingly, sun-light can effectively improve the OER electrocatalytic activity of Co-PB-NSs, the current density under radiation is about twice as high as that in dark at 1.7 V vs. RHE. These findings open up opportunities to develop more types of metal organic coordination materials, explore the new class of efficient electrocatalysts toward OER.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.135544
Computational screening of transition metal-doped phthalocyanine monolayers for oxygen evolution and reduction,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Rationally designing efficient, low-cost and stable catalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of significant importance to the development of renewable energy technologies. In this work, we have systematically investigated a series of potentially efficient and stable single late transition metal atom doped phthalocyanines (TM@Pcs, TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir and Pt) as single-atom catalysts (SACs) for applications toward the OER and ORR through a computational screening approach. Our calculations indicate that TM atoms can tightly bind with Pc monolayers with high diffusion energy barriers to prevent the isolated atoms from clustering. The interaction strength between intermediates and TM@Pc governs the catalytic activities for the OER and ORR. Among all the considered TM@Pc catalysts, Ir@Pc and Rh@Pc were found to be efficient OER electrocatalysts with overpotentials ηOER of 0.41 and 0.44 V, respectively, and for the ORR, Rh@Pc exhibits the lowest overpotential ηORR of 0.44 V followed by Ir@Pc (0.55 V), suggesting that Rh@Pc is an efficient bifunctional catalyst for both the OER and ORR. Moreover, it is worth noting that the Rh@Pc catalyst can remain stable against dissolution under the pH = 0 condition. Ab initio molecular dynamic calculations suggest that Rh@Pc could remain stable at 300 K. Our findings highlight a novel family of two-dimensional (2D) materials as efficient and stable SACs and offer a new strategy for catalyst design.",Nanoscale Advances,10.1039/c9na00648f
Rational Design of Single Atomic Co in CoNx Moieties on Graphene Matrix as an Ultra-Highly Efficient Active Site for Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe sharp increase in current energy consumption needs the development of fuel cells (FCs) as one of sustainable, renewable, efficient and eco-friendly electrochemical conversion systems of energy. The performance of electrocatalysts is crucially important for commercialization of FCs. Commercial Pt based catalysts are used due to their high catalytic activity. However, widespread commercialization is impossible because of the scarcity and poor durability of Pt based catalysts. We are on our quest to find a more stable and affordable alternative catalyst of Pt based catalysts. In particular, single-atom catalysts supported on graphene are greatly attractive because of their unique characteristic and high catalytic activity. In this work, graphene is hydrothermally treated by sulfuric acid to introduce the ion-exchanging sites. Then, Co2+ ion-exchanging, 2-methylimidazole coordination and pyrolysis process are subsequently conducted to prepare highly-dispersed single-atom Co species catalyst with outstanding ORR activity and durability.

Ruthenium-Doped Cobalt–Chromium Layered Double Hydroxides for Enhancing Oxygen Evolution through Regulating Charge Transfer,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimExploring the origin of transition metal (TM) lattice-doped layered double hydroxides (LDHs) toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in engineering efficient electrocatalysts. Without understanding the physics behind the TM-induced catalytic enhancements, it would be challenging to design the next generation of electrocatalysts. Herein, single Ru atoms are introduced into a CoCr LDHs lattice to improve activity. In 0.1 m KOH, CoCrRu LDHs require only 290 mV overpotential to drive to 10 mA cm−2 and show a Tafel slope of 56.12 mV dec−1. Electronic structure analyses based on density functional theory confirm that promoted OER activity originates from synergetic charge transfer among Ru, Cr, and Co elements. Specifically, Ru dopants can downshift d states of Co and enhance electron donation of Cr to oxygenates, which essentially breaks the scaling relation and achieves higher activity.

Tuning the Catalytic Preference of Ruthenium Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction by Atomic Dispersion,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimDeveloping cost-effective, high-performance nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) electrocatalysts is required for the production of green and low-cost ammonia under ambient conditions. Here, a strategy is proposed to adjust the reaction preference of noble metals by tuning the size and local chemical environment of the active sites. This proof-of-concept model is realized by single ruthenium atoms distributed in a matrix of graphitic carbon nitride (Ru SAs/g-C3N4). This model is compared, in terms of the NRR activity, to bulk Ru. The as-synthesized Ru SAs/g-C3N4 exhibits excellent catalytic activity and selectivity with an NH3 yield rate of 23.0 µg mgcat −1 h−1 and a Faradaic efficiency as high as 8.3% at a low overpotential (0.05 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode), which is far better than that of the bulk Ru counterpart. Moreover, the Ru SAs/g-C3N4 displays a high stability during five recycling tests and a 12 h potentiostatic test. Density functional theory calculations reveal that compared to bulk Ru surfaces, Ru SAs/g-C3N4 has more facile reaction thermodynamics, and the enhanced NRR performance of Ru SAs/g-C3N4 originates from a tuning of the d-electron energies from that of the bulk to a single-atom, causing an up-shift of the d-band center toward the Fermi level.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.201905665
Single cobalt atom anchored on N-doped graphyne for boosting the overall water splitting,"© 2019Developing inexpensive and high-active electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is important to the development of future clean energy technologies. Many non-noble metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) present unsatisfactory water-splitting catalytic performance because of their intrinsic electronic structures. Here, through the density functional theory calculations, a nitrogen atom doping strategy is applied to directly tune the electronic structure of the SAC and boost their catalytic activities towards both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By precisely manipulating N doping modes in graphyne supported single Co atom catalyst (Co@GY), the stability, electronic properties, and HER, as well as OER catalytic activities of these N-doped Co@GY catalysts are investigated. It is found that the N-induced charge redistribution on the surface of the N-doped Co@GY catalysts greatly affects their HER and OER performances. The N-induced charge density not only increases the number of active sites of Co@N1-GY and enhances its catalytic activity for HER, but also weakens the chemisorption of oxygenated species and decreases distinctly the over-potential for OER, making Co@N1-GY a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. This work offers a feasible strategy for experimental groups to properly tune the electronic structures of catalysts and improve catalytic activity.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.144155
Single Atom on the 2D Matrix: An Emerging Electrocatalyst for Energy Applications,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.The electrochemical energy conversions play an essential role in the production of sustainable and renewable energy. However, the performance is not up to the mark due to the absence of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts. Recently, both 2D-matrix and single-atom catalysts (SACs) are two intense research topics in the field of electrocatalysis due to the high activity and stability and to maximize the utilization efficiency. Engineering the materials from 3D to 2D and modification from nanoparticles to single atoms have created a significant enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity. Hybridizing both the 2D matrix and SACs (2DM@SACs) creates a new electronic state in the materials, and that bequeaths with enhancing potentials toward the electrocatalytic activity. The strong covalent interaction between the 2D matrix and SACs tunes the intrinsic activity of the electrocatalysts. In this mini-review, we have discussed the different synthesis methods of 2DM@SACs with a focus on their electrochemical energy applications such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, and carbon dioxide reduction. This mini-review appraises the contribution to the rational proposal for the synthesis of perfect 2DM@SAC catalysts with their electrochemical properties toward energy conversion applications.",ACS Omega,10.1021/acsomega.9b03515
Unsaturated Single Atoms on Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Ultrafast Hydrogen Evolution,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Large-scale implementation of electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen evolution requires cheap and efficient catalysts to replace expensive platinum. However, catalysts that work well at high current densities with ultrafast intrinsic activities is still the central challenge for hydrogen evolution. An ideal case is to use single atoms on monolayer two-dimensional (2D) materials, which simplifies the system and in turn benefits the mechanism study, but is a grand challenge to synthesize. Here, we report a universal cold hydrogen plasma reduction method for synthesizing different single atoms sitting on 2D monolayers. In the case of molybdenum disulfide, we design and identify a type of active site, i.e., unsaturated Mo single atoms on cogenetic monolayer molybdenum disulfide. The catalyst shows exceptional intrinsic activity with a Tafel slope of 36.4 mV dec-1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and superior performance at a high current density of 400 mA cm-2 with an overpotential of ∼260 mV, based on single flake microcell measurements. Theoretical studies indicate that coordinately unsaturated Mo single atoms sitting on molybdenum disulfide increase the bond strength between adsorbed hydrogen atoms and the substrates through hybridization, leading to fast hydrogen adsorption/desorption kinetics and superior hydrogen evolution activity. This work shines fresh light on preparing highly efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting and other electrochemical processes, as well as provides a general method to synthesize single atoms on two-dimensional monolayers.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.9b07763
Dual active sites of the Co2N and single-atom Co-N4 embedded in nitrogen-rich nanocarbons: A robust electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reactions,"© 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.The development of low-cost, highly efficient and durable non-precious-metal (NPM) electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great significance. Herein, we report an ingenious two-step strategy for the fabrication of NPM electrocatalysts containing multifarious cobalt species embedded in nitrogen-rich nanocarbons (Co-N-C). Firstly, Co ions were fixed by coordination with 1H-Imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline (Hip), and secondly the Co-Hip precursor with abundant Co, C and N sources was subjected to calcination at various temperatures (700-900 °C). The obtained Co-N-C catalysts exhibited excellent activity in terms of the ORR in alkaline conditions, with a half-wave potential of 0.82 eV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, which is close to that of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the Co-N-C exhibited an unexpected catalytic activity with long-term stability and immunity to methanol which is better than commercial Pt/C catalyst, suggesting that Co-N-C with dual active sites of the single-atom Co sites (Co-N4) and Co2N can be a promising alternative to replace Pt-based electrocatalysts in fuel cells. This work can provide a new route to designing promising catalysts with dual active sites for ORR.",Nanotechnology,10.1088/1361-6528/ab6471
Controlled Synthesis of a Vacancy-Defect Single-Atom Catalyst for Boosting CO2 Electroreduction,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe reaction of precursors containing both nitrogen and oxygen atoms with NiII under 500 °C can generate a N/O mixing coordinated Ni-N3O single-atom catalyst (SAC) in which the oxygen atom can be gradually removed under high temperature due to the weaker Ni−O interaction, resulting in a vacancy-defect Ni-N3-V SAC at Ni site under 800 °C. For the reaction of NiII with the precursor simply containing nitrogen atoms, only a no-vacancy-defect Ni-N4 SAC was obtained. Experimental and DFT calculations reveal that the presence of a vacancy-defect in Ni-N3-V SAC can dramatically boost the electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction, with extremely high CO2 reduction current density of 65 mA cm−2 and high Faradaic efficiency over 90 % at −0.9 V vs. RHE, as well as a record high turnover frequency of 1.35×105 h−1, much higher than those of Ni-N4 SAC, and being one of the best reported electrocatalysts for CO2-to-CO conversion to date.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201912458
Understanding the Origin of Selective Reduction of CO2 to CO on Single-Atom Nickel Catalyst,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO offers a promising strategy for regulating the global carbon cycle and providing feedstock for the chemical industry. Understanding the origin that determines the faradaic efficiency (FE) of reduction of CO2 to CO is critical for developing a highly efficient electrocatalyst. Here, by constructing a single-atom Ni catalyst on nitrogen-doped winged carbon nanofiber (NiSA-NWC), we find that the single-atom Ni catalyst possesses the maximum CO FE of over 95% at-1.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, which is about 30% higher than the standard Ni nanoparticles on the same support. The Tafel analysis reveals that the single-atom Ni catalyst has a preferred reduction of CO2 to CO and a slower rate for the hydrogen evolution reaction. We propose that the domination of singular Ni1+ electronic states and limited hydrogen atom adsorption sites on the single-atom Ni catalyst lead to the observed high FE for CO2 reduction to CO.",Journal of Physical Chemistry B,10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b09730
Single-Atom Ir-Anchored 3D Amorphous NiFe Nanowire@Nanosheets for Boosted Oxygen Evolution Reaction,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.The establishment of advanced electrocatalysts with remarkable performance and cost effectiveness for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an emerging need for the production of clean hydrogen fuel. In this work, three-dimensional (3D) amorphous NiFeIrx/Ni core-shell nanowire@nanosheets (NW@NSs) are successfully synthesized through a facile one-step reduction process with atomically isolated Ir atoms anchored on an NiFe-based core. By taking advantage of their unique structure and composition, the resultant NiFeIrx/Ni NW@NSs have a high electrocatalytic activity for OER which can deliver current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2 at overpotentials as low as 200 and 250 mV in 1 M KOH, respectively. It is worth noting that NiFeIrx/Ni NW@NSs exhibit outstanding long-term stability over 12 h at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Theoretical calculations also reveal that the intrinsic activity of the resultant NiFeIrx/Ni NW@NSs is significantly enhanced upon the addition of Ir single atoms, highlighting the critical role of the synergistic effect between Ir single atoms and the support. Due to their easy synthesis and superior electrochemical performance, the newly designed nanostructures may find promising potential applications in water splitting and other related fields.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.9b17476
"Relative Efficacy of Co−X4 Embedded Graphene (X=N, S, B, and P) Electrocatalysts towards Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: Is Nitrogen Really the Best Choice?","© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimWe perform first-principles calculations to investigate whether or not nitrogen is the best dopant in system of Co−X4 embedded graphene (X=N, S, B, and P) electrocatalysts towards hydrogen evolution reaction(HER). Our theoretical results reveal that N, S, B, and P-doped graphene can enhance the catalytic activity toward HER compared with the pristine graphene, and S doped graphene exhibits more favorable performance than N doped graphene, consistent with the experimental results. For the Co−X4 embedded graphene (X=N, S, B, and P), we predict that S may be a promising dopant in graphene supported single atom Co. The rather low hydrogen adsorption free energy (−0.07 eV) and activation energy barrier (0.78 eV) for the rate-determining step, the downshift of the d band center, the enhanced charge density of dz 2 orbital as well as the reduced work function are responsible for the unexpected activity of Co-S4 embedded graphene for HER. Overall, Co-S4 embedded graphene catalyst could be a good candidate for hydrogen evolution reaction.",ChemCatChem,10.1002/cctc.201901293
"Single-Site, Single-Metal-Atom, Heterogeneous Electrocatalyst: Metal–Organic-Framework Supported Molybdenum Sulfide for Redox Mediator-Assisted Hydrogen Evolution Reaction","© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSynthesis of single-site catalysts, whereby the local structure and surrounding chemical environments are identical, has been challenging, particularly in heterogeneous catalysis, as the support often presents spectrum of chemically distinct binding sites. Yet, the above criteria are crucial in attributing the apparent catalytic performance to the structural motif. The presented work augments on our previous work using monometallic molybdenum sulfide tethered within a zirconium-based metal-organic framework (MOF), NU-1000; the monometallic nature enables all presented sites to be catalytically addressable. As the molybdenum sulfide species resided within two distinct pores (micro- and mesopores) of the MOF support, we have imparted uniformity in the local chemical environment by reducing the pore heterogeneity down to a single mesopore. Single-site and single-atom nature of the candidate catalyst was established via X-ray diffraction measurements. Redox mediators were implemented, which, under reductive potentials, provide reduced species; they can effectively deliver the necessary reducing equivalences to the catalytic units that can otherwise not be addressed electrochemically due to the low electron mobility within the framework. Our results indicate the micropore-allocated molybdenum sulfide is approximately four times more active as that in mesopores, whereas its catalytic mechanism is identical, underscoring the importance of controlling chemical environment beyond the active site.",ChemElectroChem,10.1002/celc.201901650
Nitrogen-Stabilized Low-Valent Ni Motifs for Efficient CO2 Electrocatalysis,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Single-atom catalysts have found considerable applications in the field of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to their unique coordination environments. However, during the preparation of single-atom catalysts, some metal nanoparticles (NPs) are inevitably generated, which suffer from low selectivity in CO2RR. In this regard, complex postprocessing solution treatments are usually conducted to remove metal NPs using acid. Herein, we fabricated Ni(NC)-based catalysts composed of single Ni atoms and Ni NPs, both of which feature local Ni-N coordination via a simple Ni-metal organic framework (MOF)-assisted strategy. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy measurements, nitrogen species in N-doped carbon have been demonstrated to be coordinated with surface nickel species to form Ni-N motifs, which makes Ni at a low-valent state for efficient CO2RR. Consequently, the catalyst exhibited high performances toward CO2RR with CO Faradic efficiencies (FECO) maintained over 90% from -0.65 to -0.90 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). More importantly, the FECO of 99% could be obtained at a considerable current density (j) of -160 mA cm-2 in a flow cell configuration. These findings suggest that regulating the surface environment of Ni species can activate the original inert reaction sites into active reaction sites, providing a promising avenue to design high-performance electrocatalysts for CO2RR.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.9b02978
Novel two-dimensional MOF as a promising single-atom electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction: A theoretical study,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The conversion of CO2 is very important for alleviating environmental and resource crisis. Herein, we have systemically investigated a family of emerging 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The 2D MOFs possess characteristics of single-atom catalysts (SACs), and present higher maneuverability and practicability than modifying materials by doped single metal atoms. Our results show that the Mo-based MOF presents the promising capability of CO2 activation and reduction under ambient conditions. The value of energy cost for CO2 selectively reduced to methane is low with a value of only 0.42 eV. Moreover, the energy input can be further decreased to 0.27 eV with MoO based MOF. These energy inputs are substantially lower than classical pure metal catalysts and some novel SACs based on noble metals. This study provides insights at the atomic level that novel Mo-based MOF, in which molybdenum is an earth-abundant metal, can be used as a cost-effective single-atom electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction at mild conditions.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.143993
Atomically Dispersed Mn within Carbon Frameworks as High-Performance Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts for Zinc-Air Battery,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Manganese (Mn)-based catalysts are generally not active for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under alkaline conditions. Herein, a Mn-SA electrocatalyst consisted of atomically dispersed pyridinic-N-coordinated Mn atoms within carbon frameworks was prepared. The electrocatalyst exhibited excellent performance for ORR (E1/2 = 0.87 V) and zinc-air batteries under alkaline conditions, which is superior to that of most Mn-based catalysts and the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the nearest coordination environment can tailor the intrinsic catalytic activity of Mn centers via turning their electronic structure. The high activity of the pyridinic-N-coordinated Mn configuration is attributed to the modest adsorption strength for ORR intermediates and the reasonable position of the d-band center, which boost the ORR process.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b05713

Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.Reasonable design of electrocatalyst based on abundant earth elements is of great importance for sustainable energy use. Transition metal nitrogen doped carbon (TM-N/C) materials demonstrate excellent catalytic activity. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of these TM-N/C-systems. Herein, we have developed an effective approach to develop highly active and stable Cu promoted N-doped carbon (Cu-N/C) catalysts. The impacts of copper doping and temperature of pyrolysis on catalytic performance have been studied. The Cu-NC-800 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and stability with an onset potential (Eo) of 0.99 V and half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.85 V. It also shows strong the long-term stability. The synergistic effect between Cu (II)-N ligand and Cu0 nanoparticles is high, the active center is small, the transfer of mass is rapid, and the electrocatalytic efficiency is increased. The findings showed that the non-noble metal-based catalyst's bifunctional oxygen electrode activities prepared in this study were as high as those of commercial oxygen-based, noble metal catalysts.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1149/1945-7111/abaaa5
Elucidating the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction over a Model Single-Atom Nickel Catalyst,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimDesigning effective electrocatalysts for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an appealing approach to tackling the challenges posed by rising CO2 levels and realizing a closed carbon cycle. However, fundamental understanding of the complicated CO2RR mechanism in CO2 electrocatalysis is still lacking because model systems are limited. We have designed a model nickel single-atom catalyst (Ni SAC) with a uniform structure and well-defined Ni-N4 moiety on a conductive carbon support with which to explore the electrochemical CO2RR. Operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and near-ambient X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, revealed that Ni+ in the Ni SAC was highly active for CO2 activation, and functioned as an authentic catalytically active site for the CO2RR. Furthermore, through combination with a kinetics study, the rate-determining step of the CO2RR was determined to be *CO2 −+H+→*COOH. This study tackles the four challenges faced by the CO2RR; namely, activity, selectivity, stability, and dynamics.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201911995
Coordination Tunes Selectivity: Two-Electron Oxygen Reduction on High-Loading Molybdenum Single-Atom Catalysts,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have great potential in electrocatalysis. Their performance can be rationally optimized by tailoring the metal atoms, adjacent coordinative dopants, and metal loading. However, doing so is still a great challenge because of the limited synthesis approach and insufficient understanding of the structure–property relationships. Herein, we report a new kind of Mo SAC with a unique O,S coordination and a high metal loading over 10 wt%. The isolation and local environment was identified by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure. The SACs catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via a 2e- pathway with a high H2O2 selectivity of over 95% in 0.10m KOH. The critical role of the Mo single atoms and the coordination structure was revealed by both electrochemical tests and theoretical calculations.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/ANGE.202003842
Atomically Dispersed Nickel(I) on an Alloy-Encapsulated Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanotube Array for High-Performance Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) show great promise for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CRR), but the low density of active sites and the poor electrical conduction and mass transport of the single-atom electrode greatly limit their performance. Herein, we prepared a nickel single-atom electrode consisting of isolated, high-density and low-valent nickel(I) sites anchored on a self-standing N-doped carbon nanotube array with nickel–copper alloy encapsulation on a carbon-fiber paper. The combination of single-atom nickel(I) sites and self-standing array structure gives rise to an excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. The introduction of copper tunes the d-band electron configuration and enhances the adsorption of hydrogen, which impedes the hydrogen evolution reaction. The single-nickel-atom electrode exhibits a specific current density of −32.87 mAcm−2 and turnover frequency of 1962 h−1 at a mild overpotential of 620 mV for CO formation with 97% Faradic efficiency.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/ANGE.202002984
Acid stability and demetalation of PGM-free ORR electrocatalyst structures from density functional theory: A model for “single-atom catalyst” dissolution,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Platinum group metal-free (PGM-free) materials based on pyrolyzed M−N−C precursors offer a promising approach to replacing rare and expensive platinum group metal-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts in proton exchange fuel cells (PEFCs). A major issue, however, is the stability of these materials in acidic environments and at potentials experienced in situ in PEFC cathodes and rotating disk electrode (RDE) experiments. Density functional theory (DFT)-based approaches have been valuable to understand how atomic scale structures couple to ORR activity. Little has been reported, however, on quantification of active site structure stability. This work proposes a set of DFT-accessible descriptors for M dissolution (demetalation) that directly address this need. Through the application of this approach to a specific Fe−N4 bilayer graphene-hosted active site structure, the roles of the environment (pH and potential), ORR intermediates, and graphene underlayers are explored. Ranges of stability are reported and hypotheses explaining previously reported experimental behavior based on these findings are proposed. In particular, proposed are model implications for experimental trends in stability with respect to alkaline and acidic conditions; experimental trends for dissolution to occur below a given potential; and observed discrepancies in stability for materials in O2-bearing vs O2-purged environments. Based on these findings, suggestions for improving active site resistance to metal dissolution are provided.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.0c02856
Transition metal-tetracyanoquinodimethane monolayers as single-atom catalysts for the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Converting earth-abundant nitrogen into value-added chemical ammonia is a significant yet challenging topic. The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), compared with the conventional Haber-Bosch process, is an energy-saving and environmentally friendly approach. Finding electrocatalysts which can activate nitrogen effectively and exhibit high selectivity and stability for the electrocatalytic NRR is a major task. Single-atom catalysts can act as a good solution. In this work, by means of first-principles density functional theory, molecular dynamics calculations, and a two-step screening process, we have studied 17 transition metal single atoms supported on tetracyanoquinodimethane monolayers (TM-TCNQ), and among them, Sc-TCNQ and Ti-TCNQ are found to be excellent candidates for NRR electrocatalysts. N2 adsorption and activation are effective due to the 'acceptance-donation' mechanism and suitable electronic structure of TM-TCNQ. The Gibbs free energy diagram shows that Sc-TCNQ and Ti-TCNQ exhibit a low NRR overpotential of 0.33 and 0.22 V, respectively, through an enzymatic-consecutive mixed pathway. In addition, the selectivity of the NRR over the HER and stability of the Sc-/Ti-TCNQ monolayers are also validated. This work opens a new avenue for designing novel single-atom catalysts for the NRR as well as other catalytic applications.",Materials Advances,10.1039/d0ma00348d
Hydrogen peroxide electrochemical synthesis on hybrid double-atom (Pd-Cu) doped N vacancy g-C3N4: A novel design strategy for electrocatalyst screening,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to afford hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) provides an alternative to the traditional anthraquinone oxidation process. A major obstacle for this reaction is designing two-electron (2e-) ORR catalysts with high activity and selectivity. Combining the advantages of alloy catalysts and single-atom catalysts, hybrid double-atom catalysts (HDACs) are bringing new opportunities as highly efficient 2e- ORR catalysts. Herein, we developed a novel thermodynamic screening strategy based on oxygen and hydrogen proton adsorptions by density functional theory calculation. In accordance with theoretical predictions, Pd and Cu were screened out from 25 specimens as active centers. And a catalyst of N vacancy g-C3N4 doped with Pd-Cu hybrid double atoms (PdCu@V_C3N4) was designed. The Sabatier method illustrates that PdCu@V_C3N4 is located at the top of the 2e- ORR volcano plot with an extremely low overpotential of 0.02 V. Furthermore, the dynamic rate-determining step is OOH∗ intermediate formation with a dynamic activation barrier of 0.64 eV. The high selectivity and activity of PdCu@V_C3N4 are attributed to end-on O2 adsorption configuration by ""slope"" geometric construction and electronic regulation of neighboring hybrid atoms. Our work predicts potential HDACs for future experiments, and also provides a general method for the quick screening and design of highly efficient H2O2 catalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta12468c
"Strain effects on Co,N co-decorated graphyne catalysts for overall water splitting electrocatalysis","This journal is © the Owner Societies.Lattice strain, either tensile or compressive, can fine-tune the electronic structure of surfaces via altering the distances between surface atoms, thereby modifying the catalytic activity of catalysts. Numerous examples of strain engineering have been applied to various electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but strain-optimized 2D carbon-based single-atom electrocatalysts for catalyzing the overall water splitting reaction have received little attention. Here, we applied the lattice strain of Co,N co-decorated graphyne (Co@N1-GY) to directly optimize its catalytic activity for the overall water splitting reaction based on first-principles calculations. Our calculations suggest that compressive strain and tensile strain lead to less stability of Co@N1-GY and the distances between C and Co atoms increase linearly with the strain changing from compressive to tensile, thus linearly upshifting the p-band center of C atoms and the d-band center of Co atoms. In addition, biaxial strain has more remarkable effects on these properties than uniaxial strain. From compressive to tensile strain, the chemisorption of electrochemically generated intermediates in both HER and OER becomes weaker and weaker. A tensile strain of 0.5% on Co@N1-GY gives an ideal HER performance, while the OER reaches the minimum overpotential of 0.33 V under the biaxial tensile strain of 3%.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/c9cp05548g
Pore size effect of graphyne supports on CO2 electrocatalytic activity of Cu single atoms,"© 2020 the Owner Societies.The instinctive chemical inertia of CO2 impedes its electrochemical reduction by high energy input. Single atom catalysts (SACs) on supports are considered as a class of excellent electrocatalysts with high activity, selectivity and atomic efficiency for CO2 electrochemical reduction. Supports for single atoms are believed to greatly impact the electrocatalytic activity of SACs. However, further research on the relationship between the structure of supports for SACs and CO2 electroreduction is still needed. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to investigate the role of supports in tuning the CO2 electrocatalytic activity of SACs. Graphynes with different pore sizes (graphyne, graphdiyne, graphyne-3 and graphyne-4) are taken into account to unveil the effect of their skeleton structure on the anchored Cu single atoms. We found that support skeletons could greatly impact the coordination configuration of metal atoms and the steric repulsion of support skeletons to intermediates. These two factors jointly result in different electrocatalytic performances of SACs. The comparative analysis proves that the graphynes with large pores are appropriate supports for Cu adatoms for CO2 electroreduction due to the low-coordinated Cu atoms and weak-steric-repulsion carbon skeleton. Such SACs exhibit much enhanced activity and selectivity as compared with the Cu(111) surface and monoatomic Cu on nitrogen-doped graphene. This work provides a new insight into the rational design of supports for SACs.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/c9cp05624f
Atomically Dispersed Mo Supported on Metallic Co9S8 Nanoflakes as an Advanced Noble-Metal-Free Bifunctional Water Splitting Catalyst Working in Universal pH Conditions,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimWater splitting requires development of cost-effective multifunctional materials that can catalyze both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiently. Currently, the OER relies on the noble-metal catalysts; since with other catalysts, its operation environment is greatly limited in alkaline conditions. Herein, an advanced water oxidation catalyst based on metallic Co9S8 decorated with single-atomic Mo (0.99 wt%) is synthesized (Mo-Co9S8@C). It exhibits pronounced water oxidization activity in acid, alkali, and neutral media by showing positive onset potentials of 200, 90, and 290 mV, respectively, which manifests the best Co9S8-based single-atom Mo catalyst till now. Moreover, it also demonstrates excellent HER performance over a wide pH range. Consequently, the catalyst even outperforms noble metal Pt/IrO2-based catalysts for overall water splitting (only requiring 1.68 V in acid, and 1.56 V in alkaline). Impressively, it works under a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with no obvious decay during a 24 h (0.5 m H2SO4) and 72 h (1.0 m KOH) durability experiment. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that the synergistic effects of atomically dispersed Mo with Co-containing substrates can efficiently alter the binding energies of adsorbed intermediate species and decrease the overpotentials of the water splitting.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201903137
Atomically Defined Undercoordinated Active Sites for Highly Efficient CO2 Electroreduction,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimElectrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2ER) in rechargeable Zn–CO2 battery still remains a great challenge. Herein, a highly efficient CO2ER electrocatalyst composed of coordinatively unsaturated single-atom copper coordinated with nitrogen sites anchored into graphene matrix (Cu–N2/GN) is reported. Benefitting from the unsaturated coordination environment and atomic dispersion, the ultrathin Cu–N2/GN nanosheets exhibit a high CO2ER activity and selectivity for CO production with an onset potential of −0.33 V and the maximum Faradaic efficiency of 81% at a low potential of −0.50 V, superior to the previously reported atomically dispersed Cu–N anchored on carbon materials. Experimental results manifest the highly exposed and atomically dispersed Cu–N2 active sites in graphene framework where the Cu species are coordinated by two N atoms. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the optimized reaction free energy for Cu–N2 sites to capture CO2 promote the adsorption of CO2 molecules on Cu–N2 sites; meanwhile, the short bond lengths of Cu–N2 sites accelerate the electron transfer from Cu–N2 sites to *CO2, thus efficiently boosting the *COOH generation and CO2ER performance. A designed rechargeable Zn–CO2 battery with Cu–N2/GN nanosheets deliver a peak power density of 0.6 mW cm−2, and the charge process of battery can be driven by natural solar energy.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.201907658
"Synergistically enhanced oxygen reduction electrocatalysis by atomically dispersed and nanoscaled Co species in three-dimensional mesoporous Co, N-codoped carbon nanosheets network","© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Metal-nitrogen-codoped carbon (M-N-C) nanostructures are promising electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Despite the great progress that has been achieved, synthesizing three-dimensional porous nanoarchitectures derived from Co-N-C nanosheets or related nanohybrids with high content (> 5 wt%) of exposed single-atom sites remains a challenge. Herein, novel three-dimensional mesoporous Co-N-C nanosheets network enwrapping small amount of Co nanoparticles nanohybrids are fabricated by molten-salt template-assisted pyrolysis of Co-folic acid precursors and chemical etching. In the obtained nanohybrids, the content of single-atom-like Co (SA-Co%) is 7.4 wt% < SA-Co%<19.4 wt%. Due to the unique mesoporous nanosheets network structure and efficient synergy of atomic and nanoscaled Co species, such nanohybrids manifest enhanced ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V, outperforming pure Co-N-C, Pt/C and most of other reported catalysts. Moreover, their stability exceeds that of Pt/C. This work will lead to the optimization of M-N-C nanostructures and accelerate their applications in fuel cells.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.118207
Co single-atom anchored on Co3O4 and nitrogen-doped active carbon toward bifunctional catalyst for zinc-air batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Highly efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts are urgently explored for high energy density and safe metal-air batteries. Herein, an ingenious Co-Co3O4@NAC is prepared for this purpose by anchoring Co single atom on both Co3O4 nanoparticle and nitrogen-doped active carbon (NAC), where synergistic interaction among Co atoms, Co3O4 particles and NAC plays a significant role for excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, the primary zinc-air battery (ZAB) with the Co-Co3O4@NAC as a cathode catalyst shows a high open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.449 V, a specific energy density of 721 mA h/g and a maximum power density of 164 mW/cm2. The rechargeable ZAB with this catalyst displays a low voltage gap of 0.773 V at 10 mA/cm2 and stable cycling performance. This work provides a novel tactic to design elaborate high-efficient and promising bifunctional catalysts with non-noble metal atom and metal oxide for metal-air batteries.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.118188
Engineering the multiscale structure of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for highly efficient and ultrastable zinc-air battery,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are attracting enormous attention owing to their low cost and high theoretical energy density. However, their practical applications are impeded by the low lifetimes and inferior energy conversion efficiency as a result of poor catalyst stability and sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at their air cathode. Herein, a multiscale structural engineering of the novel catalyst of Fe/Co single atoms co-doped graphite nanoarrays mounted on carbon microspheres (FeCo(a)-ACM) is reported towards ORR and OER for ZABs. In micro-scale, 3D hierarchically porous carbon microspheres facilitate the mass and electron transport; in nano-scale, ordered graphite nanoarrays increase the accessible chances of the active sites; in atomic-scale, chemical doping of Fe/Co single atoms boost the intrinsic ORR and OER activity and finally enhance the performance of ZABs. The FeCo(a)-ACM exhibits excellent ORR (onset potential: 1.03 V, half-wave potential: 0.90 V) and OER (1.60 V at 10 mA cm−2) activity. In a practical demonstration, a low charge-discharge gap and a record rechargeable lifetime lasting 900 h at 10 mA cm−2 are achieved by zinc-air battery with FeCo(a)-ACM within the air electrode.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2019.07.028
Single Mn atom as a promising electrocatalyst for CO reduction to C2H5OH and C3H6: A computational study,"© 2019By means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we proposed that the single Mn atom supported on C2N monolayer could be employed as a single-atom catalyst (SAC) for CO electroreduction reaction (COER) to C2+ products. Our results revealed that the single Mn atom can be stably anchored on C2N monolayer (Mn@C2N) due to the strong hybridization between Mn-3d orbitals and N-2p orbitals. Interestingly, the synergistic effect of the anchored Mn atom and its adjacent N atoms on C2N layer can give rise to the C[sbnd]C coupling between adsorbed CO molecules, thus facilitating their subsequent hydrogenation to CH4, C2H5OH and (especially) C3H6 with small limiting potentials of −0.69, −0.43 and −0.08 V, respectively. Thus, the single Mn atom supported by C2N monolayer exhibits superior COER catalytic activity to C2+ products, which offers cost-effective opportunities for the development of single-atom catalysts for the efficient CO electroreduction to multicarbon products.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.143868
Cobalt atoms dispersed on hierarchical carbon nitride support as the cathode electrocatalyst for high-performance lithium-polysulfide batteries,"© 2019 Science China PressLithium-sulfur batteries are promising candidates for next-generation energy storage but are confronted with several challenges. One of the possible solutions is to design proper cathode electrocatalysts to accelerate the redox interconversion of solvated polysulfide intermediates. Herein, we report cobalt atoms dispersed on hierarchical carbon nitride support as an effective cathode electrocatalyst for lithium-polysulfide batteries. The electrocatalyst material is prepared from the simple reaction between melamine and cyanuric acid in the presence of Co2+, followed by the Ar annealing. The product has a unique hierarchical structure consisting of many thin and porous C3N4 nanosheets finely dispersed with Co atoms. The atomic dispersion of Co species is confirmed by X-ray absorption experiments. Electrochemical measurements reveal that it can promote the interconversion of polysulfides. As a result, batteries using this cathode electrocatalyst achieve large capacity (∼1400 mAh/g at 1.6 mA/cm2), good rate performance (∼800 mAh/g at 12.8 mA/cm2) and impressive cycling stability under different current densities and different sulfur loadings.",Science Bulletin,10.1016/j.scib.2019.08.016
Isolated Fe atoms dispersed on cellulose-derived nanocarbons as an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Cost-effective preparation of efficient electrocatalysts is vitally important for energy storage and conversion. Here, a facile chemical activation strategy using biomass cellulose as the carbon feedstock to fabricate isolated Fe atoms dispersed on a nitrogen doped graphene/nanocarbon hybrid is reported. This new single atom catalyst aFe-NGC worked as an excellent electrocatalyst towards the ORR compared to commercial Pt/C with 30 mV higher positive half-wave potential, larger current density, better stability and stronger methanol-Tolerance. The key active sites for enhancing the ORR activity originated from the constructed high loading Fe-N/C configuration coupled with doped nitrogens, as explored by optimizing the activation temperatures and characterized by state-of-The-Art techniques including aberration-corrected STEM and synchrotron XANES. This strategy could be developed into a general approach to prepare highly efficient atomic metal electrocatalysts using abundant biomass as a cost-effective carbon source.",Nanoscale,10.1039/c9nr07914a
Cu@g-C3N4: An Efficient Single-Atom Electrocatalyst for NO Electrochemical Reduction with Suppressed Hydrogen Evolution,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Nitric oxide electroreduction reaction (NOER) is one of the most attractive routes for ammonia synthesis and pollutant treatment. However, the current research efforts toward the NOER mainly focus on metal surface catalysts, while low-cost and high-efficiency single-atom catalysts (SACs) are rarely explored. Herein, using first-principles computations, we systematically investigate the NOER performance of a series of transition-metal-atom-decorated graphitic carbon nitride monolayer (g-C3N4) and identify single Cu-atom-decorated g-C3N4 (Cu@g-C3N4) as the most promising SAC candidate for the NOER. Our results indicate that Cu@g-C3N4 harbors excellent catalytic activity for the NOER with a quite low limiting potential of 0.371 V and, interestingly, is promising to be synthesized due to extremely high stability. Most importantly, Cu@g-C3N4 can efficiently suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, in favor of achieving high Faradaic efficiency. Our work provides a promising SAC candidate for the NOER to resolve environmental pollution and sustainable ammonia production.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b08827
Cooperativity in Bimetallic SACs: An Efficient Strategy for Designing Bifunctional Catalysts for Overall Water Splitting,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Designing novel support materials for single-atom catalysts (SACs) is a recent challenge for the water splitting reaction. Despite advances in 2D nanomaterials and their heterostructures for application in catalysis, investigation on finite-size supports is scarce. Recently, flat boron has emerged as a fascinating concept in cluster science. Accordingly, in the present study, the ability of the finite-size quasiplanar cluster of boron, namely B36, as a potential support for transition metals from 3d series (Sc-Zn) is theoretically investigated. We found that B36 is firm to support the single metal atom steadily. Then, the electrocatalytic activity of doped B36 was systematically investigated toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Activity analysis indicates that Ni-doped B36 and Ti-doped B36 are promising electrocatalysts for OER and HER, respectively, outperforming pristine B36. However, despite the superior performance of single-atom doping over the pristine B36, none of the examined systems can act as a bifunctional catalyst for both OER and HER. In the second part, we focus on the B38 cluster, because the double-hole structure provides additional opportunities to tune its electronic structure via dual doping and achieve improved catalytic performance. Four pairs of 3d transition metals, FeCr, FeCo, FeNi, and FeCu, are considered to investigate the intermetallic cooperativity effect on the OER and HER activities. Based on the results, a greater degree of synergistic effect is observed in FeNi-codoped B38. The computed Gibbs free energy for OER and HER confirms the feasibility of OER on an Fe center and HER on a Ni center. Therefore, it is expected that the strategy of bimetal codoping on a single-material platform can provide a new route for designing a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b08171
Atomically Dispersed Nickel Sites for Selective Electroreduction of CO2,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction at its point of generation to form fuels and commodity chemicals using electricity from renewable sources is an appealing strategy for decreasing net anthropogenic CO2 emissions and mitigating global warming. CO2 reduction is however a kinetically slow and energy intensive reaction with a wide range of possible products. Therefore, the development of highly selective, energy-efficient, and cost-effective electrocatalysts is required to accelerate this kinetically sluggish process. We report facile synthesis of atomically dispersed Ni sites supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (Ni/NC), which significantly facilitates selective electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO with a Faradaic efficiency reaching 92.3% at a low overpotential of 0.69 V (relative to the formal redox potential of CO2 reduction to CO, E0 redox = -0.11 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, pH 0), surpassing Ni particles and many other reported metal-based catalysts. This study thus unveils a platform of activating Ni sites for selective reduction of CO2",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.9b01828
Design of a High-Performance Electrocatalyst for N2 Conversion to NH3 by Trapping Single Metal Atoms on Stepped CeO2,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have recently been shown to have high performance in catalyzing the synthesis of NH3 from N2. Here, we systematically investigated a series of single transition metal atoms anchored on stepped CeO2 (CeO2-S) to screen the potential electrocatalysts for a N2 reduction reaction (NRR) via density functional theory computations. We first demonstrated that these SACs are stable via large calculated binding energies. Second, we evaluated the adsorption of *N2 over CeO2-S-supported single atoms. Here, those systems that can activate N2 molecules were selected as candidates. We then showed that CeO2-S-supported single Mo and Ru atoms have high catalytic activity for NRR via low limiting potentials of -0.52 and -0.35 V, respectively. Meanwhile, the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction is highly suppressed over these two SACs because the adsorption of *N2 is prior to *H. Finally, the origin of the NRR activity over these SACs was investigated. This work offers useful insights into designing high-performance CeO2-based electrocatalysts for NRR.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.9b15570
O-Doping Boosts the Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction Activity of a Single Fe Site in Hydrophilic Carbon with Deep Mesopores,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Carbon-based electrocatalysts with single metal sites hold great potential for mechanism exploration via mimicking molecular catalysts, due to their distinct catalytic sites. In addition to metal atoms, the neighboring nonmetal heteroatoms such as N, S, and O atoms, which are widely detected in carbon-based single-atom catalysts, may also contribute to enhancing the electrochemical activity of single-metal centers. In this work, the boosting effect of O-doping toward the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was evaluated by both experimental studies and DFT calculations. O-doped carbon-supported single-Fe-site catalysts possessing deep mesopores and desirable hydrophilic surface were achieved by confined carbonization in an inert or reductive atmosphere (SAFe-NDC and SAFe-NDC-H). As compared to the state-of-the-art Pt/C, these catalysts showed superior catalytic activity toward the ORR in terms of half-wave potential, Tafel slope, and long-term stability. In particular, SAFe-NDC-H outperformed its SAFe-NDC counterpart. Considering that these two catalysts possess a comparable porous structure, surface properties, and local electronic structure of a single Fe site, the dopant nonmetal O atoms, specifically, carbonyl group (C= O), are revealed to affect the ORR activity of the single Fe site exclusively. The introduced C= O facilitates the formation of *OOH as well as the reduction of *OH, thereby reducing the catalysts' overpotential.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.9b18510
Single-Atom Ru Doping Induced Phase Transition of MoS2 and S Vacancy for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimUsing electrochemical water splitting to produce hydrogen is still a grand challenge due to the lack of economical and efficient Pt-free catalysts. Herein, a single-atom Ru supported on MoS2 (SA-Ru-MoS2) electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. Results indicate that single-atom Ru doping induces phase transition of MoS2 and generation of S vacancies, which significantly improve the performance of inert 2D MoS2 for HER. In particular, the SA-Ru-MoS2 electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 76 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline media, which is superior to most electrocatalysts previously reported in the literature. Combining experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is further revealed that the origin of high HER activity is mainly attributed to the synergy effects of single-atom Ru doping and S vacancies and phase transition of local structure of MoS2, which efficiently tailors the electronic structure of SA-Ru-MoS2 and extremely reduces the energy barrier of the Volmer step and the adsorption/desorption of H* intermediate step. In short, this work provides a single-atom doping strategy to transfer the inert MoS2 into the highly efficient electrocatalysts.",Small Methods,10.1002/smtd.201900653
Single Fe atoms anchored by short-range ordered nanographene boost oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media,"© 2019The development of efficient and stable single-atom electrocatalysts with earth-abundant metals have emerged as a promising alternative to the costly Pt-based nanomaterials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we synthesize a highly efficient electrocatalyst with single Fe atoms anchored by N-doped short-range ordered carbon loading on 2 D reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Unlike the highly graphitized carbon materials in previous ORR catalysts, in which the diffusion of oxygen molecules (∼3.46 Å) are blocked by long carbon chains and small interlayer spacing (∼3.4 Å), it is found that the Fe/N-doped nanographene possesses large interlayer spacing (>4 Å) and short carbon fragments in one layer. The unique nanographene structure in nanoscale can facilitate the transport of oxygen molecules to the active sites of atomically dispersed FeN4 and FeN5. In acidic media for ORR, as-prepared Fe1-N-NG/RGO catalyst exhibited half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.84 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, and the loss of E1/2 is less than 5 mV during 15,000 potential cycles.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104164
Single-atom electrocatalysis: a new approach to in vivo electrochemical biosensing,"© 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Modulation of interfacial electron transfer has been proven to pave a new approach to in vivo electrochemical monitoring of brain chemistry; however, designing and establishing highly efficient electrocatalytic scheme towards neurochemicals remain a long-standing challenge. Here, we find that recently established single-atom catalyst (SAC) can be used for catalyzing the electro-chemical process of physiologically relevant chemicals and thus offers a new avenue to in vivo electrochemical biosensing. To prove this new concept, we used Co single-atom catalyst (Co-SAC), in which the atomic active sites are dispersed in ordered porous N-doping carbon matrix at atomic level, as an example of SACs for analyzing glucose as the physiologically relevant model chemicals. We found that Co-SAC catalyzes the electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at a low potential of ca. +0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). This property was further used for developing an oxidase-based glucose biosensor that was used subsequently as a selective detector of an online electrochemical system (OECS) for continuous monitoring of microdialysate glucose in rat brain. The OECS with Co-SAC-based glucose biosensor as the online detector was well responsive to glucose without interference from other electroactive species in brain microdialysate. This study essentially offers a new approach to in vivo electrochemical analysis with SACs as electrocatalysts to modulate interfacial electron transfer.",Science China Chemistry,10.1007/s11426-019-9605-0
Atomically Dispersed Binary Co-Ni Sites in Nitrogen-Doped Hollow Carbon Nanocubes for Reversible Oxygen Reduction and Evolution,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimWith the inspiration of developing bifunctional electrode materials for reversible oxygen electrocatalysis, one strategy of heteroatom doping is proposed to fabricate dual metal single-atom catalysts. However, the identification and mechanism functions of polynary single-atom structures remain elusive. Atomically dispersed binary Co-Ni sites embedded in N-doped hollow carbon nanocubes (denoted as CoNi-SAs/NC) are synthesized via proposed pyrolysis of dopamine-coated metal-organic frameworks. The atomically isolated bimetallic configuration in CoNi-SAs/NC is identified by combining microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. When employing as oxygen electrocatalysts in alkaline medium, the resultant CoNi-SAs/NC hybrid manifests outstanding catalytic performance for bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution reactions, boosting the realistic rechargeable zinc–air batteries with high efficiency, low overpotential, and robust reversibility, superior to other counterparts and state-of-the-art precious-metal catalysts. Theoretical computations based on density functional theory demonstrate that the homogenously dispersed single atoms and the synergistic effect of neighboring Co-Ni dual metal center can optimize the adsorption/desorption features and decrease the overall reaction barriers, eventually promoting the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. This work not only sheds light on the controlled synthesis of atomically isolated advanced materials, but also provides deeper understanding on the structure–performance relationships of nanocatalysts with multiple active sites for various catalytic applications.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.201905622
Single-Atomic-Co Electrocatalysts with Self-Supported Architecture toward Oxygen-Involved Reaction,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSingle-atomic electrocatalysts (SACs) have shown great promise in electrocatalysis fields owing to their theoretical maximum atom utilization (100%). Yet still, it is far from expectation in practical applications due to entrapping within supports and blocking by aggregation. Herein, self-supported carbon nanosheet arrays consisting of single-atomic Co electrocatalyst (SS-Co-SAC) toward oxygen-involved reaction and zinc–air batteries are reported. Impressively, the as-synthesized SS-Co-SAC gives a markedly enhanced utilization of active sites (≈22.3%@2.3 wt%) as a result of single-atomic dispersion of Co within a unique nanosheet arrays architecture, which is the largest value among other reported results. Benefiting from the high utilization of active sites, the SS-Co-SAC electrode exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, the turnover frequency value for ORR is determined to be ≈9.26 s−1, which stands for the highest level among noble metal-free electrocatalysts reported previously. Moreover, as an air-cathode for zinc–air batteries with SS-Co-SAC, a power density of 195.1 mW cm−2 and a robust durability are achieved. It is believed that this study would guide the future design of highly active and durable single-atom catalysts for both fundamental research and practical applications.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.201906477
High loading single-atom Cu dispersed on graphene for efficient oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2019Single-atom metal dispersed on graphene materials are highly desired in various fields such as energy conversion/storage, catalysis and nanoelectronics. However, the fabrication of such materials with high loading level is still challenging, as the conventional pyrolysis protocol usually leads to metal agglomeration due to the poor thermal stability of metal precursors and the high surface energy of single-atom metals. Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of single-atom Cu dispersed on graphene (Cu/G) with ultrahigh Cu loading of 5.4 wt%, using a unique confined self-initiated dispersing protocol. It is revealed that Cu is introduced into graphene matrix via highly active gaseous Cu-containing intermediate, which results in abundant and well-dispersed Cu-containing moieties. This Cu/G material with ultrahigh loading level as an electrocatalyst presents remarkable activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the abundant and highly dispersive Cu single atoms, even outperforming the commercial Pt/C. Our findings not only facilitate the development of single-atom metal dispersed on graphene materials but also highlight the importance of tuning active site structures in non-noble metal electrocatalysis.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104088
Directly transforming copper (I) oxide bulk into isolated single-atom copper sites catalyst through gas-transport approach,"© 2019, The Author(s).Single-atom metal catalysts have sparked tremendous attention, but direct transformation of cheap and easily obtainable bulk metal oxide into single atoms is still a great challenge. Here we report a facile and versatile gas-transport strategy to synthesize isolated single-atom copper sites (Cu ISAS/NC) catalyst at gram levels. Commercial copper (I) oxide powder is sublimated as mobile vapor at nearly melting temperature (1500 K) and subsequently can be trapped and reduced by the defect-rich nitrogen-doped carbon (NC), forming the isolated copper sites catalyst. Strikingly, this thermally stable Cu ISAS/NC, which is obtained above 1270 K, delivers excellent oxygen reduction performance possessing a recorded half-wave potential of 0.92 V vs RHE among other Cu-based electrocatalysts. By varying metal oxide precursors, we demonstrate the universal synthesis of different metal single atoms anchored on NC materials (M ISAS/NC, where M refers to Mo and Sn). This strategy is readily scalable and the as-prepared sintering-resistant M ISAS/NC catalysts hold great potential in high-temperature applications.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-019-11796-4
Single platinum atoms embedded in nanoporous cobalt selenide as electrocatalyst for accelerating hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2019, The Author(s). Designing efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction is significant for renewable and sustainable energy conversion. Here, we report single-atom platinum decorated nanoporous Co 0 . 85 Se (Pt/np-Co 0 . 85 Se) as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. The achieved Pt/np-Co 0 . 85 Se shows high catalytic performance with a near-zero onset overpotential, a low Tafel slope of 35 mV dec −1 , and a high turnover frequency of 3.93 s −1 at −100 mV in neutral media, outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst and other reported transition-metal-based compounds. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies combined with density functional theory calculations indicate that single-atom platinum in Pt/np-Co 0 . 85 Se not only can optimize surface states of Co 0 . 85 Se active centers under realistic working conditions, but also can significantly reduce energy barriers of water dissociation and improve adsorption/desorption behavior of hydrogen, which synergistically promote thermodynamics and kinetics. This work opens up further opportunities for local electronic structures tuning of electrocatalysts to effectively manipulate its catalytic properties by an atomic-level engineering strategy.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-019-09765-y
Design of high-performance MoS2 edge supported single-metal atom bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting: Via a simple equation,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.MoS2 edges exhibit good hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity but poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The development of MoS2 edge supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) for both the HER and OER is critical for overall water splitting. In this work, for the purpose of triggering OER performance and maintaining HER performance, 28 single transition-metal (TM) SACs supported on MoS2 edges as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting have been screened by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In order to design and achieve high OER performance, a simple equation derived from the chemical environment and local structure of the active center is used as a structure descriptor to predict the OER activities of MoS2-based SACs. Among these candidates, the T1-vacancy termination modified using a Pt single atom shows the lowest theoretical overpotential for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction being just-0.10/0.46 V, respectively, which is comparable to those of the precious-metal-group benchmark catalysts for overall water splitting. It is expected that our results can offer a theoretical basis for simplifying and steering the design of efficient electrocatalytic materials.",Nanoscale,10.1039/c9nr06083a
Engineering of Nitrogen Coordinated Single Cobalt Atom Moieties for Oxygen Electroreduction,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.The nitrogen coordinated single cobalt atoms embedded in carbon matrix, i.e., Co/N/C material, is cost-efficient and free from iron-ion induced Fenton reagent, which has been thus considered as a promising candidate to replace the well-accepted Pt-based and Fe/N/C materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Recently, the pyrolysis of metal-organic framework (MOF) precursors has been investigated to achieve well-defined Co/N/C catalysts with high ORR activity. However, the relationships among the composition/structure of MOF precursor, the derived catalysts, and ORR performance have been rarely touched in specialty, while the regulations to achieve single-atom Co/N/C catalysts derived from MOF are confusing. Herein, we engineer several Co-doped MOF (zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, to be specific) precursors with different compositions and structures by tuning synthesis protocols (e.g., ratios, cobalt sources, and reaction time) and investigate the derived catalysts and their ORR properties. The regulations to single-atom Co/N/C are revealed in this work. The superior ORR activity and durability of the optimized Co/N/C catalysts are revealed and attributed to the well-defined Co-Nx moieties and their stable nanostructures.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.9b11830
Insights into the role of active site density in the fuel cell performance of Co-N-C catalysts,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Improvement of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) performance of Co-N-C electrocatalyst requires an in-depth understanding of performance enhancement mechanism. Herein, we synthesize a series of Co-N-C catalysts with different CoN4 densities. CoN4 active sites (electrochemical accessible ones) and CoN4 species are differentiated in the study. The power density shows a slow linear increase in the low concentration region and an accelerated increase in the high concentration region of CoN4 active sites, showing the crucial role of the high active site density to the high power density of Co-N-C. The optimized Co-N-C achieves a high power density of 826 mW cm−2. Meanwhile, CoN4 ORR turnover frequency (TOF) is calculated to be 0.01 s−1 at 0.8 V vs. RHE in acid media. The results allow us to predict that many non-precious metal catalysts with only moderate activity may have considerable PEMFC performance as long as possessing sufficiently dense active sites.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.117849
Urea-bridging synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon tube supported single metallic atoms as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for zinc-air battery,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Single atom (SA) catalysts have recently emerged as promising candidates to substitute noble metals catalysts. Herein, a urea-bridge method has been exploited to fabricate stable metallic single atom dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon tubes. The preparation involved a facile pyrolysis of ellagic acid (EA)-metal coordination compound mediated through the usage of urea. During the synthesis process, urea acted as a bridge to drive the formation of hollow carbon tube as well as to provide N sites to immobilize SA in a space-confined environment. The active SA sites together with the accessibility and rapid mass transport from the hollow substrate endowed the obtained EA-SAs (e.g. EA-Co-900, EA-Ni-900) outstanding performances in oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Furthermore, EA-Co-900 showed a high power density (e.g. 73 mW cm−2, at 65 mA cm−2) and excellent durability of 110 h at 20 mA cm−2 when assembled into rechargeable zinc-air batteries.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.117778
Theoretical Screening of Single Transition Metal Atoms Embedded in MXene Defects as Superior Electrocatalyst of Nitrogen Reduction Reaction,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe MXene-supported single transition metal systems have been reported as promising electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Herein, the potential performance of MXene-based catalysts was explored on nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Density functional theory computations are carried out to screen a series of transition metal atoms confined in a vacancy of MXene nanosheet (Mo2TiC2O2). The results reveal that the Zr, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Re, and Os supported on defective Mo2TiC2O2 layer can significantly promote the NRR process. Among them, Zr-doped single atom catalyst (Mo2TiC2O2-ZrSA) possesses the lowest barrier (0.15 eV) of the potential-determining step, as well as high selectivity over HER competition. To the best of knowledge, 0.15 eV is the lowest barrier of potential-determining step that has been reported for NRR so far. Besides, the formation energy of Mo2TiC2O2-ZrSA is much more negative than that of the synthesized Mo2TiC2O2-PtSA catalyst, suggesting that the experimental preparation of Mo2TiC2O2-ZrSA is feasible.

KGaA, WeinheimDirect conversion of CO2 into carbon-neutral fuels or industrial chemicals holds a great promise for renewable energy storage and mitigation of greenhouse gas emission. However, experimentally finding an electrocatalyst for specific final products with high efficiency and high selectivity poses serious challenges due to multiple electron transfer, complicated intermediates, and numerous reaction pathways in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Here, an intrinsic descriptor that correlates the catalytic activity with the topological, bonding, and electronic structures of catalytic centers on M–N–C based single-atom catalysts is discovered. The “volcano”-shaped relationships between the descriptor and catalytic activity are established from which the best single-atom catalysts for CO2 reduction are found. Moreover, the reaction mechanisms, intermediates, reaction pathways, and final products can also be distinguished by this new descriptor. The descriptor can also be used to predict the activity of the single-atom catalysts for electrochemical reactions such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in fuel cells and water-splitting. These predictions are confirmed by the experimental results for onset potential and Faraday efficiency. The design principles derived from the descriptors open a door for rational design and rapid screening of highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 conversion as well as other electrochemical energy systems.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201902625
Unveiling the Activity Origin of Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution over Isolated Ni Atoms Supported on a N-Doped Carbon Matrix,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimExploring highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and unveiling their activity origin are pivotal for energy conversion technologies. Herein, atomically distributed Ni sites over a N-doped hollow carbon matrix are reported as a promising electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline conditions. Significantly boosted activity is observed after the decoration of the active Ni sites with well-controlled coordination geometry. Results of X-ray absorption spectroscopy investigation and density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveal that the effective electronic coupling via the Ni–N coordination can move down the Fermi level and lower the adsorption energy of intermediates, thus resulting in the facilitated OER kinetics.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.201904548
Recent Insights into the Oxygen-Reduction Electrocatalysis of Fe/N/C Materials,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Owing to the high activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the selectivity toward the four-electron pathway, single atom Fe/N/C electrocatalysts have been considered as the most promising low-cost candidates to replace Pt in fuel cells. Despite the significant progress achieved in the past decade, the performance and durability of Fe/N/C catalysts remain far behind that of the Pt-based materials in practical devices such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) in light-duty vehicles. Recent progress in Fe/N/C electrocatalysis has been mainly based on the empirical approach with rather random combinational synthesis conditions and precursors. For rational design of applicable Fe/N/C catalysts, an insightful understanding of fundamental electrocatalysis of Fe/N/C is required. In this critical review, we will focus on the mechanisms of the ORR catalysis of Fe/N/C, the categories of active sites in Fe/N/C catalysts including the electronic and structural properties of the catalytic centers, the assessment and quantification of the active sites, pH effect on the activity, and the degradation mechanisms. We hope the comprehensive and thorough discussions of Fe/N/C electrocatalysis will help to guide the design and development of high-performance Fe/N/C electrocatalysts toward the application of PEMFCs.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.9b02583
Atomically Isolated Iron Atom Anchored on Carbon Nanotubes for Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Recently, electrocatalysts based on anchored dispersive/isolated single metal atoms on conductive carbon supports have demonstrated great promise to substitute costly Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the field of fuel cells or metal-air batteries. However, developments of cost-efficient single-atom Fe catalysts with high activities are still facing various hardships. Here, we developed a facile way to synthesize isolated iron atoms anchored on the carbon nanotube (CNT) involving a one-pot pyrrole polymerization on a self-degraded organic template and a subsequent pyrolysis. The as-obtained electrocatalyst possessed unique characteristics of abundant nanopores in the wall of conductive CNTs to host the abundant atomic Fe-Nx active sites, showing ultrahigh ORR activity (half-wave potential: 0.93 V, kinetic current density: 59.8 mA/cm2 at 0.8 V), better than that of commercial Pt/C (half-wave potential: 0.91 V; kinetic current density: 38.0 mA/cm2 at 0.8 V) in an alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, good ORR activity has been proven in acidic solution with a half-wave-potential of 0.73 V.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.9b12054
Graphyne doped with transition-metal single atoms as effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting,"© 2019Developing highly active and non-precious-metal single-atom catalysts (SAC) for electrochemical water splitting is of great significance to the development of renewable energy technology in future. Herein, 10 first-row transition-metal (TM, from Sc to Zn) single atoms anchored on a graphyne (GY) nanosheet (TM@GY) as electrocatalysts for water splitting are explored through computational screening approach. It is found that the single atoms prefer to tightly bind at the acetylenic-ring center of GY. Meanwhile, these TM@GY catalysts show metallic properties or reduced band gap, favoring electron transfer during the electrochemical processes. Moreover, both Co@GY and Mn@GY catalysts present good catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with both the acetylenic C and TM atoms being highly active sites. However, only the Co@GY catalyst shows good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 0.55 V. Thus, Co@GY could serve as a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. Besides, the d-band center of TM atoms on TM@GY can be turned through controlling TM atoms with different d-electron number and be used to predict the OER performance. This work highlights that GY doped with single non-precious-metals can be considered for designing high-active and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical electrochemical reactions.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.06.050
A di-boron pair doped MoS2 (B2@MoS2) single-layer shows superior catalytic performance for electrochemical nitrogen activation and reduction,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Developing efficient electrocatalysts to convert nitrogen into ammonia represents a major chemistry challenge and is of great significance for sustaining life. A lot of recent studies have been focusing on the single-atom electrocatalysts for the N2 reduction reaction (NRR), yet the double-atom or few-atom catalysts, based on the non-metal catalytic center, in particular, have been rarely investigated. Herein from DFT simulations, we report diatomic boron doped single-layer MoS2, B2@MoS2, as the potential electrocatalyst for the nitrogen reduction reaction, and compare it with single boron atom doped MoS2, B@MoS2, based on thermodynamics, selectivity, and kinetics analysis. The results reveal that this novel diatomic modified catalyst exhibits excellent structural and thermodynamic stability, and shows significant improvement in the conductivity of MoS2 which is essential for the electrocatalytic NRR. Furthermore, the B2@MoS2 catalyst can effectively activate the inert N2 and promote N2 reduction to NH3via the enzymatic mechanism, and shows much better electrocatalytic activity than B@MoS2, as reflected by the significantly reduced overpotential (0.02 V vs. 0.30 V) and the much lower activation barrier (1.24 eV vs. 2.84 eV). Particularly, the close-to-zero overpotential predicted for B2@MoS2 is lower than those of most ever-reported single-atom electrocatalysts. The extraordinary activity of B2@MoS2 is closely related to the efficient electron transport as well as the synergism effect of diatomic boron. Our predictions hence suggest B2@MoS2 as a superior promising catalyst for efficient dinitrogen fixation and reduction.",Nanoscale,10.1039/c9nr06469a
Bismuth Single Atoms Resulting from Transformation of Metal-Organic Frameworks and Their Use as Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR) is a promising strategy to promote the global carbon balance and combat global climate change. Herein, exclusive Bi-N4 sites on porous carbon networks can be achieved through thermal decomposition of a bismuth-based metal-organic framework (Bi-MOF) and dicyandiamide (DCD) for CO2RR. Interestingly, in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) analysis not only directly shows the reduction from Bi-MOF into Bi nanoparticles (NPs) but also exhibits subsequent atomization of Bi NPs assisted by the NH3 released from the decomposition of DCD. Our catalyst exhibits high intrinsic CO2 reduction activity for CO conversion, with a high Faradaic efficiency (FECO up to 97%) and high turnover frequency of 5535 h-1 at a low overpotential of 0.39 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Further experiments and density functional theory results demonstrate that the single-atom Bi-N4 site is the dominating active center simultaneously for CO2 activation and the rapid formation of key intermediate COOH∗ with a low free energy barrier.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.9b08259
Markedly enhanced oxygen reduction activity of single-atom fe catalysts via integration with fe nanoclusters,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to noble metalbased catalysts for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). While SACs can offer notable benefits in terms of lowering overall catalyst cost, there is still room for improvement regarding catalyst activity. To this end, we designed and successfully fabricated an ORR electrocatalyst in which atomic clusters are embedded in an atomically dispersed Fe-N-C matrix (FeAC@FeSA-N-C), as shown by comprehensive measurements using aberration- corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The half-wave potential of FeAC@FeSA-N-C is 0.912 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), exceeding that of commercial Pt/C (0.897 V), FeSA-N-C (0.844 V), as well as the half-wave potentials of most reported non-platinum-group metal catalysts. The ORR activity of the designed catalyst stems from single-atom active centers but is markedly enhanced by the presence of Fe nanoclusters, as confirmed by both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.9b05913
Computational screening of transition-metal single atom doped C9N4 monolayers as efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The search for high efficiency and low-cost catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is vital to overall water splitting. In this work, on the basis of first-principles calculations, we screened a series of late transition metal atoms supported on a C9N4 monolayer (TM@C9N4, where TM represents Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt) as electrocatalysts for both the HER and OER. Our results demonstrate that the TM atoms can be bonded with the nitrogen atoms around the hole to form stable structures, and the bonded TM atoms are stable against diffusion. Co@C9N4 exhibits high catalytic activity toward the HER. In particular, the N active sites in the Co@C9N4, Ni@C9N4, and Pt@C9N4 systems demonstrate relatively high performance for the HER. However, Co@C9N4 and Pt@C9N4 exhibit low OER activities with large overpotentials. Among the ten cases of TM@C9N4 considered here, only Ni@C9N4 performs as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst with N and Ni atoms as catalytic active sites for the HER and OER, with a calculated hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔGH∗) of-0.04 eV and an OER overpotential (ηOER) of 0.31 V. The results demonstrate that TM@C9N4 is a promising single-atom catalytic system, which can be used as the non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.",Nanoscale,10.1039/c9nr05991a
Doping sp-hybridized B atoms in graphyne supported single cobalt atoms for hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis,"© 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCElectrochemical water splitting to hydrogen is considered as a promising approach for clean H2 production. However, developing highly active and inexpensive electrocatalysts is an important part of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we present a multifaceted atom (sp2-and sp-hybridized boron) doping strategy to directly fine-modify the electronic structures of the active site and the HER performance by the density functional theory calculations. It is found that the binding strength between the Co atom and the B doped graphyne nanosheets can be enhanced by doping B atoms. Meanwhile, the Co@B1-GY and Co@B2-GY catalysts exhibit good thermodynamic stability and high HER catalytic activity. Interestingly, the Co@B2-GY catalyst has an ideal HER performance with the ΔGH* value of −0.004 eV. Moreover, the d-band center of the Co atoms is upshifted by the sp2-or sp-hybridized B dopants. The concentrations of the sp-hybridized B atoms have a positive effect on the electrons transformation of the Co atoms. The interaction between the H and Co atoms becomes strong with the increase of the concentrations of the sp-hybridized B atoms and thus the corresponding catalysts show sluggish HER kinetics. This investigation could provide useful guidance for the experimental groups to directly and continuously control the catalytic activity towards HER by precisely doping multifaceted atoms.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.08.195
Monoatomic Platinum-Anchored Metallic MoS2: Correlation between Surface Dopant and Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Rationally designing cheap and efficient electrocatalysts at the atomic level is highly desirable for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we demonstrate a metallic MoS2 electrocatalyst decorated with platinum single atoms. When combined with electron microscopy observations, our synchrotron X-ray characterizations and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that the doped Pt atoms bond to S atoms on the surface of MoS2. Notably, these Pt single atoms serve as critical active centers for the HER through capturing H+ from the solution. The optimized Pt-MoS2 catalysts achieve significantly enhanced HER performance due to the single-atom coordination effect. This finding is expected to facilitate further realization of hybridized catalysts through the monatomic riveting strategy.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b01892
A Graphene-Supported Single-Atom FeN5 Catalytic Site for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimElectrochemical conversion of CO2 into valued products is one of the most important issues but remains a great challenge in chemistry. Herein, we report a novel synthetic approach involving prolonged thermal pyrolysis of hemin and melamine molecules on graphene for the fabrication of a robust and efficient single-iron-atom electrocatalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction. The single-atom catalyst exhibits high Faradaic efficiency (ca. 97.0 %) for CO production at a low overpotential of 0.35 V, outperforming all Fe-N-C-based catalysts. The remarkable performance for CO2-to-CO conversion can be attributed to the presence of highly efficient singly dispersed FeN5 active sites supported on N-doped graphene with an additional axial ligand coordinated to FeN4. DFT calculations revealed that the axial pyrrolic nitrogen ligand of the FeN5 site further depletes the electron density of Fe 3d orbitals and thus reduces the Fe–CO π back-donation, thus enabling the rapid desorption of CO and high selectivity for CO production.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201906079
Theoretical Investigation on the Single Transition-Metal Atom-Decorated Defective MoS2 for Electrocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Using density functional theory calculations, we explored the potential of defective MoS2 sheets decorated with a series of single transition-metal (TM) atoms as electrocatalysts for the N2 reduction reaction (NRR). The computed reaction free-energy profiles reveal that the introduction of embedded single TM atoms significantly reduces the difficulty to break the NN triple bond and thus facilitates the activation of inert nitrogen. Onset potential close to -0.6 V could be achieved by anchoring various TMs, such as Sc, Ti, Cu, Hf, Pt, and Zr, and the formation of the second ammonia molecule limits the overall process. The Ti-decorated nanosheet possesses the lowest free-energy change of -0.63 eV for the potential determining step. To better predict the catalysis performance, we introduced a descriptor, which is the product of the number of valence electron and electronegativity of the decorated TM. It shows a good linear relationship between the d-band center and binding energy of nitrogen, except for those metals with less than half-filled d-band. Although the metals in Group IIIB and IVB have strong adsorption interactions with N atoms, the Gibbs free-energy changes for desorption of the second ammonia are unexpectedly low. The selectivity of these systems toward nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is also significantly improved. Therefore, those defective MoS2 decorated with Sc, Ti, Zr, and Hf are suggested as promising electrocatalysts for NRR, for their both high efficiency and selectivity.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.9b07705
Two-Dimensional Conjugated Aromatic Networks as High-Site-Density and Single-Atom Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimTwo-dimensional conjugated aromatic networks (CAN) with ultra-thin conjugated layers (ca. 3.5 nm) and high single-metal-atom-site density (mass content of 10.7 wt %, and 0.73 metal atoms per nm2) are prepared via a facile pyrolysis-free route involving a one-step ball milling of the solid-phase-synthesized polyphthalocyanine. These materials display outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mass activity of 47 mA mgcat.−1 represents 1.3- and 6.4-fold enhancements compared to Pt and Pt/C in benchmark Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, the primary Zn-air batteries constructed with CAN as an air electrode demonstrate a mass/volume power density of 880 W gcat.−1/615 W cmcat.−3 and stable long-term operation for 100 h. This strategy offers a new way to design high-performance electrocatalysts with atomic precision for use in other energy-storage and conversion applications.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201908023
Insight into the Activity and Stability of Transition-Metal Atoms Embedded in MnO for Triiodide Reduction Reaction,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.It is of great significance to study single-atom catalysts and their electrocatalytic behavior, which not only dramatically reduces the use of precious metals but also greatly promotes the design of electrocatalysts at atomic and molecular scales. In this work, a new single-atom catalyst, Pt1/MnO, was designed and synthesized. As a counter electrode (CE) material in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), Pt1/MnO was systematically investigated for its triiodine reduction reaction (TRR) catalytic activity by different electrochemical methods, and the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs devices assembled by Pt1/MnO CEs was also tested. Based on the experimental study, the relationship between the microstructure of Pt1/MnO and its catalytic activity was analyzed by density function theory (DFT) simulation calculation. Compared with MnO, Pt1/MnO had a relative lower work function, meaning that Pt1/MnO had a much better catalytic activity toward TRR. The density of states (DOS) results indicated that single-atom Pt led to a bit higher occupied states of Pt1/MnO(100) around the Fermi energy level compared to MnO(100). However, its electrochemical stability was relatively poor in the tests of 100 consecutive cyclic voltammetry. To analyze the reasons for its poor stability further, we studied the stability of a series of transition-metal (TM) atoms embedded in MnO by DFT. It was predicted that the following stable single-atom catalysts (SACs) might be obtained: Y1/MnO, Zr1/MnO, La1/MnO, and Hf1/MnO, with Mn vacancy of Mn (100) surface as anchoring sites. Meanwhile, Pt1/MnO did not satisfy the stability condition, which was consistent with its relatively poor electrochemical stability. This study may help shed light on designing and fabricating SACs of high activity and stability in DSSC devices.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b05951
Intrinsically Synergistic Active Centers Coupled with Surface Metal Doping to Facilitate Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Efficient catalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) in acid media usually lose substantial performance in alkaline media primarily due to their inefficiency in the prior step: water dissociation. To circumvent the issue, synergistic catalysts have been designed via combining them with metal (hydro)oxides. While this strategy suffers from high cost and complicated fabrication methods, generating catalytic synergy within a single-phase catalyst is considerably more promising. Herein, using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that Ni2P is such a prototypical catalyst whose (001) surface provides not only uniformly distributed single-atom-like but also more importantly intrinsically synergetic active sites to catalyze different elementary steps of alkaline HER. Significantly, the unique structural attributes enable surface metal doping to effectively modulate the activity through a bifunctional mechanism and lead to a robust activity descriptor: OH binding strength. We believe that these findings will provide a rational paradigm that advances innovative design of high-performance and economic electrocatalysts for alkaline HER.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b08127
Unraveling the reactivity and selectivity of atomically isolated metal-nitrogen sites anchored on porphyrinic triazine frameworks for electroreduction of co2,"© CCS Chemistry 2019.Electroreduction of CO2(CO2RR) to value-added chemicals offers a promising approach to balance the global carbon emission, but still remains a significant challenge due to high overpotential, lowfaradaic efficiency, and poor selectivity of electrocatalysts systems. Thus the key point is to develop low-cost, highly efficient, and durable electrocatalysts for CO2RR. To benefit from their exposed active sites and to maximize atomic efficiency, single-metal atom catalysts that usually show high activities are required. Herein, we unravel the trends in the reactivity and selectivity of atomically isolatedM-N4 (M = Ni, Cu, Fe, and Co) sites within porous porphyrinic triazine framework (metal single atoms/PTF) for the electroreduction of CO2to CO. We found that NiSAs/PTF exhibited the highest faradaic efficiency (98%) at a mild potential of -0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and the highest turnover frequency of 13,462 h-1 for the production CO at an applied potential of -1.2 V. The relations of catalytic performance of CO2to CO over the different active M-N4 sites were unraveled by the combination of density functional theory calculations and experiments. This work gives an extensive mechanistic understanding of the selectivity of CO2to CO from the M-N4 sites at an atomic scale, thus it will bring new inspiration for the design of highly efficient CO2RR.",CCS Chemistry,10.31635/ccschem.019.20190011
Oxygen-terminated BiXenes and derived single atom catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2019 Elsevier Inc.Advanced materials for active hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts are central to the area of renewable energy. Here we report for the first time the application of two-dimensional (2D) oxygen-terminated BiXenes as a new family of electrocatalysts for the HER in terms of the following electrochemical descriptors: Gibbs free energy of H adsorption (ΔGH), exchange current density and the required potential to achieve a 10 mA/cm2 current density (polarization curve). The results reveal that oxygen-terminated BiXenes have a high density of catalytically active sites, excellent electric conductivity, and maintain a high HER activity over a wide range of hydrogen coverages. Among these systems, Mo2CO2 are identified as exceptional HER catalyst in virtue of the comparable overpotential (107 mV) to that of Pt (58 mV). Most importantly, on the basis of a concept of “electron donation”, depositing single transition metals (TM) on the surface of oxygen-terminated BiXenes to form single atom catalysts (SACs) and strain engineering, both of which are demonstrated to efficiently weaken the H bonding strength, are promising routes to enhance the HER activity of oxygen-terminated BiXenes. Our work is the first report of oxygen-terminated BiXenes, offering cost-effective alternatives to traditional Pt-based catalysts for advancing sustainable hydrogen evolution.",Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/j.jcat.2019.08.019
"Cu,N-Codoped Carbon Nanodisks with Biomimic Stomata-Like Interconnected Hierarchical Porous Topology as Efficient Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction","© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimMetal,N-codoped carbon (M-N-C) nanostructures are promising electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or other gas-involved energy electrocatalysis. Further creating pores into M-N-C nanostructures can increase their surface area, fully expose the active sites, and improve mass transfer and electrocatalytic efficiency. Nonetheless, it remains a challenge to fabricate M-N-C nanomaterials with both well-defined morphology and hierarchical porous structures. Herein, high-quality 2D Cu-N-C nanodisks (NDs) with biomimic stomata-like interconnected hierarchical porous topology are synthesized via carbonization of Cu-tetrapyridylporphyrin (TPyP)-metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) precursors and followed by etching the carbonization product (Cu@Cu-N-C) along with re-annealing treatment. Such hierarchical porous Cu-N-C NDs possess high specific surface area (293 m2 g−1) and more exposed Cu single-atom sites, different from their counterparts (Cu@Cu-N-C) and pure N-C control catalysts. Electrochemical tests in alkaline media reveal that they can efficiently catalyze ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), comparable to Pt/C and outperforming Cu@Cu-N-C, N-C, Cu-TPyP-MOFs, and most other reported M-N-C catalysts. Moreover, their stability and methanol-tolerant capability exceed Pt/C. This work may shed some light on optimizing 2D M-N-C nanostructures through bio-inspired pore structure engineering, and accelerate their applications in fuel cells, artificial photosynthesis, or other advanced technological fields.",Small,10.1002/smll.201902410
Single-Atom Fe-Nx-C as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Zinc–Air Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimHighly efficient non-noble metal electrocatalysts are vital for metal–air batteries and fuel cells. Herein, a noble-metal–free single-atom Fe-N x-C electrocatalyst is synthesized by incorporating Fe-Phen complexes into the nanocages in situ during the growth of ZIF-8, followed by pyrolysis at 900 °C under inert atmosphere. Fe-Phen species provide both Fe2+ and the organic ligand (Phen) simultaneously, which play significant roles in preparing single-atom catalysts. The obtained Fe-Nx-C exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.91 V for the oxygen reduction reaction, higher than that of commercial Pt/C (0.82 V). As a cathode catalyst for primary zinc–air batteries (ZABs), the battery shows excellent electrochemical performances in terms of the high open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.51 V and a high power density of 96.4 mW cm−2. The rechargeable ZAB with Fe-Nx-C catalyst and the alkaline electrolyte shows a remarkable cycling performance for 300 h with an initial round-trip efficiency of 59.6%. Furthermore, the rechargeable all-solid-state ZABs with the Fe-Nx-C catalyst show high OCV of 1.49 V, long cycle life for 120 h, and foldability. The single-atom Fe-Nx-C electrocatalyst may function as a promising catalyst for various metal–air batteries and fuel cells.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.201808872
Coordination-Dependent Catalytic Activity and Design Principles of Metal-Organic Frameworks as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Clean Energy Conversion,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising as high performance electrocatalysts in clean energy conversion and storage owing to their unique porous structures, large surface area, and atomically distributed nonprecious transition metal ions (single atom catalysts). However, the ligands or coordinations of metal ions strongly influence their catalytic activities, making it complicated for selecting better catalysts. To rationally design the MOF catalysts, we have calculated the catalytic activities of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a subset of the MOF hybrids, with the density-functional theory (DFT) methods and identified an intrinsic descriptor that governs the catalytic activities of the ZIFs. Our DFT calculations show that the unsaturated metal sites exhibit higher catalytic activities than those of the best noble metal electrocatalysts. The efficiency and selectivity of the ZIF catalysts could be improved by controlling the number of ligands/coordinations and type of metal ions. The best catalysts are identified for fuel cells, water splitting, and direct prodiction of hydrogen peroxide. The theoretical predictions are supported by experimental data. This work provides a theoretical base and guiding principles for rational design of high-performance MOF-based electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion and storage.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b10375
Nanostructure of Cr2CO2 MXene Supported Single Metal Atom as an Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Nanostructure-supported single-atom bifunctional catalysts can reduce the usage of catalyst and improve the catalytic activity compared with unifunctional catalysts. Developing effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting is one of the central issues to the area of renewable energy. Herein, we report a single transition-metal atom anchoring on the Cr2CO2 MXene surface as bifunctional eletrocatalyst for water splitting through density functional theory calculations. Results show that Ni anchored on Cr2CO2 (Ni/Cr2CO2) MXene exhibits satisfactory catalytic activity producing low overpotentials of 0.16 and 0.46 V for HER and OER, respectively. Large amounts of electrons were transferred from Ni to the surface O∗ of Cr2CO2, promoting the binding strength between Ni and Cr2CO2 (binding energy is -5.16 eV). The ultrahigh Ni oxide formation pressure (O2 pressure is higher, at 3 × 1019Pa) ensures the stability of Ni/Cr2CO2 during electrocatalytic water splitting. Moreover, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and climbing nudged elastic band calculations suggest that Ni atom can be stably immobilized on Cr2CO2 substrate to prevent its aggregation to form Ni3 and Ni4 clusters. In addition, the possible synthesis route is predicted for a Cr2CO2-supported Ni single-atom catalyst (SAC) system showing that Ni/Cr2CO2 can be experimentally synthesized. This work shows that Cr2CO2-supported Ni SAC can be a potential catalyst for water splitting and therefore provides an opportunity for energy conversion.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.9b01329
Palladium Single-Atom Catalysts Supported on C@C3N4 for Electrochemical Reactions,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSingle atom catalysts (SACs) maximize the utilization of noble metal whereas nanoparticle catalysts have inner metal atoms unavailable. In this study, various electrocatalytic reactions were investigated for Pd and Pt SACs. The single atoms were immobilized on thin layers of graphitic carbon nitride with carbon black (for simplicity, C@C3N4) to produce an electrochemically efficient and stable SACs. Single atomic structure was confirmed by high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and CO stripping experiments were conducted, and the results were compared with the corresponding nanoparticle catalysts. Lack of ensemble sites in the SACs resulted in two-electron pathway for ORR; single atomic Pd on C@C3N4 (C@C3N4−Pd1) showed high activity and selectivity for H2O2 formation. DFT calculations showed that C@C3N4−Pd1 follows a downhill path for H2O2 formation unlike single atomic Pt on C@C3N4 (C@C3N4-Pt1), resulting in enhanced H2O2 selectivity. Weaker adsorption of oxygen intermediates on C@C3N4−Pd1 resulted in enhanced ORR activity. The SACs showed no interaction with CO as confirmed by no CO stripping peak. This resulted in no activity for formic acid oxidation following indirect pathway or methanol oxidation, which necessitates COads as reaction intermediates. SACs can be efficient electrocatalysts with high activity and unique selectivity.",ChemElectroChem,10.1002/celc.201900772
Metal-Free B@ g-CN: Visible/Infrared Light-Driven Single Atom Photocatalyst Enables Spontaneous Dinitrogen Reduction to Ammonia,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Conversion of naturally abundant dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) is one of the most attractive and challenging topics in chemistry. Current studies mainly focus on electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) using metal-based electrocatalysts, while metal-free and solar-driven photocatalysts have been rarely explored. Here, on the basis of the ""σ donation-Ï€∗ back-donation"" concept, single B atom supported on holey g-CN (B@g-CN) can serve as metal-free photocatalyst for highly efficient N2 fixation and reduction under visible and even infrared spectra. Our results reveal that N2 can be efficiently activated and reduced to NH3 with extremely low overpotential of 0.15 V and activation barrier of 0.61 eV, lower than most of metal-based NRR catalysts, thereby guaranteeing low energy cost and fast kinetics of NRR. The inherent properties of B@g-CN, such as centralized spin-polarization on the B atom, efficient prohibition of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and reduced exciton binding energy, are responsible for the high selectivity and Faradaic efficiency for NRR under ambient conditions. Moreover, for the first time, we theoretically disclose that the external potential provided by photogenerated electrons for NRR/HER endowing B@g-CN spontaneous NRR and inaccessible HER. This work may provide a promising lead for designing efficient and robust metal-free single atom catalysts toward photocatalytic NRR under visible/infrared spectrum.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b02572
Updating the Intrinsic Activity of a Single-Atom Site with a P-O Bond for a Rechargeable Zn-Air Battery,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Rechargeable Zn-air batteries have drawn great attention over the past decade, but their further development will require efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts to drive the sluggish cathodic reactions. Although a single-atom catalyst with maximum utilization per metal atom shows great promise, its catalytic performance is still far from satisfactory. Here we tackle this challenge by introducing a P-O bond to update the intrinsic activity of a single-atom site and thus reduce the reaction overpotential of the Zn-air battery. The critical role of the P-O bond in producing a favorable surface electronic environment of the single-atom metal site and improving its catalytic activity is identified with density functional theory simulations. The P-O-doped, atomically dispersed catalyst is shown experimentally to deliver excellent bifunctional performance, with a remarkable half-wave potential of 0.89 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction and a reversible oxygen electrode index of 0.74 V, exceeding those of most reported nonprecious metal catalysts. When subjected to practical application, both aqueous and all-solid-state Zn-air batteries illustrate superior power density and robust cyclic performance, confirming their potential feasibility in next-generation electronic devices.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.9b11337
"Evaluating the Catalytic Efficiency of Paired, Single-Atom Catalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction","© 2019 American Chemical Society.Paired, single-atom catalysts have been shown to demonstrate synergistic effects computationally and experimentally which enable them to outperform the benchmark catalyst, Pt/C, for electrochemical reactions. We explore the limit of these catalysts by screening different transition metal atoms (M = Co, Pt, Fe, Ni) in nitrogen-doped graphene for their ability to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We employ density functional theory methods to explore the electronic factors affecting catalytic activity in an effort to rationalize trends in the performance of materials which are promising candidates for the next generation of electrocatalysts. It is found that CoPt@N8V4, composed of paired Co and Pt in a nitrogen-doped four-atom vacancy in graphene (N8V4), performs ideally for the ORR with an overpotential (Î•) of 0.30 V, followed closely by Co and Ni (Î• = 0.35 V) and paired Co (Î• = 0.37 V). The origin of activity is suggested to be the changing reduction potential of the active Co atom via the local distortion of the pore by the spectating metal partner. We utilize the ORR scaling relations and plot catalytic activity on a volcano plot, which we correlate with the degree of antibonding interactions with the O atom in the OH intermediate of the ORR. We establish that the local tuning of paired catalysts allows for the reactivity of metal atoms to be specifically modified for desirable reactivity.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.9b02178
Two-Dimensional Organometallic TM3–C12S12 Monolayers for Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2,"© 2019 Zhengzhou UniversityOrganometallic nanosheets are a versatile platform for design of efficient electrocatalyst materials due to their high surface area and uniform dispersion of metal active sites. In this paper, we systematically investigate the electrocatalytic performance of the first transition metal series TM3–C12S12 monolayers on CO2 using spin-polarized density functional theory. The calculations show that TM3–C12S12 exhibits excellent catalytic activity and selectivity in the catalytic reduction in CO2. The main reduction products of Sc, Ti, and Cr are CH4. V, Mn, Fe and Zn mainly produce HCOOH, and Co produces HCHO, while CO is the main product for Ni and Cu. For Sc, Ti, and Cr, the overpotentials are >0.7 V, while for V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, the overpotentials are very low and range from 0.27 to 0.47 V. Therefore, our results indicate that many of the TM3–C12S12 monolayers are expected to be excellent and efficient CO2 reduction catalysts.",Energy and Environmental Materials,10.1002/eem2.12048
Insights into thermal annealing of highly-active PtCu3/C Oxygen Reduction Reaction electrocatalyst: An in-situ heating transmission Electron microscopy study,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdThermal annealing processes for supported Pt-based nanoparticles are usually developed based on iterative empirical findings resulting from ex-situ characterization of pre- and post-annealed samples. Such an approach, however, offers limited insight into processes occurring during the heating step. In this work, we first exemplify typical findings that are accessible by ex-situ investigation using typical conventional techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thin film – rotating disc electrode (TF-RDE). As a model system we select a well-researched Pt-Cu alloy which, as demonstrated, offers exciting new insights into the dynamics occurring during heat treatment on the nano-to-atomic scale. This dynamics can be viewed by upgrading the ex-situ findings with a high resolution TEM imaging in combination with carefully designed in-situ heating protocol. This way one can directly observe the particle growth mechanisms during heat treatment. Such direct observations, in turn, provide new understanding of morphology-performance correlations in alloys. For example, it is shown that the enhanced activity of the present PtCu3/C electrocatalyst is due to Cu enrichment during heat treatment. This enrichment, however, is only possible due to the presence of relatively large excess CuO needle-like particles left over from the previous double passivation galvanic displacement step. Very importantly, we further show that the mechanism of Cu enrichment at elevated temperatures involves migration of Cu single atoms via the carbon support. At moderate temperatures (up to 500 °C), other effects have also been observed such as reshaping into a sphere-like shape as well as ordering of the crystal lattice which could not occur without enrichment of the initial Pt-Cu nanoparticles with Cu. In that region, Cu enrichment is also responsible for the initial growth of PtCu nanoparticles. By contrast, upon heating till 800 °C, the growth is mainly due to coalescence. Ostwald ripening, on the other hand, does not seem to play a significant role in the increase in the nanoparticle size. The new general insights can be readily extended to various other similar alloy systems.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.103892
Atomic Cobalt on Defective Bimodal Mesoporous Carbon toward Efficient Oxygen Reduction for Zinc–Air Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) with maximum atom-utilization efficiency and distinctive properties are emerging as a new frontier in the field of catalysis. Herein, a new strategy for synthesizing stable Co single atoms with content of about 1.52 wt% on defective bimodal mesoporous carbon materials (A-Co@CMK-3-D) is reported. The dispersion and coordination structures of atomic Co species at carbon defect sites are confirmed by both aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (AC-HRTEM) and X-ray absorption spectrometry, respectively. The obtained catalyst exhibits efficient electrochemical performance on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline electrolyte with a half-wave potential (0.835 V vs RHE), which is comparable to that of Pt/C (0.839 V vs RHE). Furthermore, the Zn–air batteries (ZABs) fabricated by this electrocatalyst display a superior discharging and charging performance with long-term durability. This work provides a new approach on optimizing SAC-based carbon materials from multiscale principles (simultaneous regulation of electronic structure and hierarchical morphology) to boost ORR reactivity.",Small Methods,10.1002/smtd.201800450
Transition-Metal Single Atoms Anchored on Graphdiyne as High-Efficiency Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting and Oxygen Reduction,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSingle-atom catalysts, which can maximize the utility of metal atoms, and at the same time achieve high catalytic performance, have attracted great interest in research. In this present study, 11 transition metal atoms supported on a graphdiyne (GDY) monolayer (TM@GDY, where TM represents a transition metal from Sc to Zn and Pt) as electrocatalysts are investigated by means of first-principle calculations. It is found that the supported single atom is very stable at the corner of the acetylenic ring. These features can help in the realization of uniformly distributed and well-ordered single atoms on GDY. Few composites viz Sc@GDY, Ti@GDY, V@GDY, Fe@GDY, and Pt@GDY display high catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Especially for Ti@GDY and V@GDY, both C and TM are active sites which are the best HER catalysts among the studied composites. Moreover, Pt@GDY and Ni@GDY composites can be promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting [0.01 and 0.46 V for HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)] and metal–air-battery (0.29 and 0.40 V for OER and oxygen reduction reaction) catalysts, respectively. This work demonstrates that GDY is indeed a promising single-atom support which can be considered for the design of high activity and inexpensive multifunctional electrocatalysts for practical catalytic applications.",Small Methods,10.1002/smtd.201800419
Direct observation of yolk-shell transforming to gold single atoms and clusters with superior oxygen evolution reaction efficiency,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Noble metal particles and atoms tend not to react with other media even at elevated temperatures due to their inert nature. Herein, we report surprising findings of Au diffusion and dissolution in a Ni2P matrix, forming single Au atoms and tiny clusters. The dynamic atomic diffusion process was directly probed by in situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The Au yolks can diffuse and dissolve completely into the Ni2P shell at temperatures of 350 °C or higher, resulting in an inward volume expansion of the Ni2P shell and formation of single Au atoms and tiny Au clusters in Ni2P. The resulting structure exhibited outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiency that is 16-fold that of commercial IrO2. The in situ STEM finding explains its drastically improved catalytic performance after annealing, confirming Au single atoms and clusters on a Ni2P surface as active OER sites. Our finding emphasizes the role of dynamic structural changes during simple heat treatment to enhance catalysis efficiency.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.9b02135
Controlling the Chemical Bonding of Highly Dispersed Co Atoms Anchored on an Ultrathin g-C3N4@Carbon Sphere for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Controlling the chemical bonding of an active atom and carbon support is an effective strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of a metal-nitrogen/carbon catalyst. Herein, highly dispersed Co atoms are successfully prepared by using an ultrathin g-C3N4@carbon sphere as the support, and subsequently the well-defined Co-N and Co-O bonds on the atomic level are controllably constructed by adjusting the calcination atmosphere. Results show that highly dispersed Co with Co-O and Co-N bonds exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance in alkaline media at low and high overpotentials, respectively, and outperform most single-atom catalysts reported to date. DFT calculation, coupled with high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry techniques, reveals that the high activities mainly originate from the precise O-Co-N and N-Co-N coordination in the ultrathin g-C3N4@carbon sphere support. The enhancement mechanism of chemical bonding provides guidance for the atomic exploration and design of electrocatalysts.",Inorganic Chemistry,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01089
"General π-Electron-Assisted Strategy for Ir, Pt, Ru, Pd, Fe, Ni Single-Atom Electrocatalysts with Bifunctional Active Sites for Highly Efficient Water Splitting","© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimBoth the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial to water splitting, but require alternative active sites. Now, a general π-electron-assisted strategy to anchor single-atom sites (M=Ir, Pt, Ru, Pd, Fe, Ni) on a heterogeneous support is reported. The M atoms can simultaneously anchor on two distinct domains of the hybrid support, four-fold N/C atoms (M@NC), and centers of Co octahedra (M@Co), which are expected to serve as bifunctional electrocatalysts towards the HER and the OER. The Ir catalyst exhibits the best water-splitting performance, showing a low applied potential of 1.603 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 m KOH solution with cycling over 5 h. DFT calculations indicate that the Ir@Co (Ir) sites can accelerate the OER, while the Ir@NC3 sites are responsible for the enhanced HER, clarifying the unprecedented performance of this bifunctional catalyst towards full water splitting.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201904614
Atomic scandium and nitrogen-codoped graphene for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Rational design of highly active and durable electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction is critical to substitute precious metal platinum for fuel cells. Herein, a novel non-precious atomic scandium embedded into nitrogen-doped graphene material is successfully synthesized via a facile annealing method. The catalyst exhibits superior oxygen reduction reaction performance in both 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, with onset potential (Eonset, 0.99 vs 0.82 V) and half-wave potential (E1/2, 0.89 vs 0.72 V). Theoretical calculations reveal that the possible active sites for ORR might be ScN3O and ScN2O embedded into the N-doped graphene. The outstanding electrochemical stability and strong tolerance to methanol crossover on the atomic scandium and nitrogen-codoped graphene make it a promising application in metal-air batteries and fuel cells.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.126650
One-pot synthesis of porous 1T-phase MoS2 integrated with single-atom Cu doping for enhancing electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has attracted great interest as a promising non-precious-metal catalyst candidate to replace the precious-metal Pt catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Nevertheless, the catalytic efficiency of MoS2 is significantly restricted by its density of catalytic active sites and inert basal plane. In this work, we have designed a facile one-pot solvothermal method to synthesize porous 1T-MoS2 that is integrated with atomic doping of Cu atoms. The as-prepared Cu@MoS2 sample exhibits enhanced HER performance with a low overpotential of 131 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm2, a small Tafel slope of 51 mV/dec and as well as a good long-term stability. Enhanced HER performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of 1T-MoS2 metallic phase, single atom Cu doping and numerous sulfur vacancies. Theoretical calculations indicates that the adsorption energy of Cu atom on 1T-MoS2 surface (−3.68 eV) is much higher than that on 2H-MoS2 surface (−1.94 eV), moreover, the Cu atom adsorbed on the surface of the 1T-MoS2 has larger charge transfer (−0.38e), which can be contributed to further enhance HER performance of 1T-MoS2.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.03.053
In Situ Formed Pt3Ti Nanoparticles on a Two-Dimensional Transition Metal Carbide (MXene) Used as Efficient Catalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reactions,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.The design of efficient catalysts capable of delivering high currents at low overpotentials for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) is urgently needed to use catalysts in practical applications. Herein, we report platinum (Pt) alloyed with titanium (Ti) from the surface of Ti3C2Tx MXenes to form Pt3Ti intermetallic compound (IMC) nanoparticles (NPs) via in situ coreduction. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicates that Pt undergoes a temperature-dependent transformation from single atoms to intermetallic compounds, and the catalyst reduced at 550 °C exhibits a superior HER performance in acidic media. The Pt/Ti3C2Tx-550 catalyst outperforms commercial Pt/Vulcan and has a small overpotential of 32.7 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a low Tafel slope of 32.3 mV dec-1. The HER current was normalized by the mass and dispersion of Pt, and the mass activity and specific activity of Pt/Ti3C2Tx-550 are 4.4 and 13 times higher, respectively, than those of Pt/Vulcan at an overpotential of 70 mV. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the (111)- and (100)-terminated Pt3Ti nanoparticles exhibit∗H binding comparable to Pt(111), while the (110) termination has an∗H adsorption that is too exergonic, thus poisoned in the low overpotential region. This work demonstrates the potential of MXenes as platforms for the design of electrocatalysts and may spur future research for other MXene-supported metal catalysts that can be used for a wide range of electrocatalytic reactions.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b01381
Engineering Monolayer 1T-MoS2 into a Bifunctional Electrocatalyst via Sonochemical Doping of Isolated Transition Metal Atoms,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.There has been an intense research effort to develop 2-H MoS2 based catalysts to reduce or eliminate the use of Pt/C at higher metal loading for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in catalytic hydrolysis of water, which enables the capture of renewable energy sources as fuel and chemical. However, the study of its uncommon polymorph, 1T-MoS2, and particularly the doping effect with transition metal (TM) is rather limited due to the instability of this phase. Here, we report a simple ambient temperature modification method using sonication to dope the single layer 1T-SMoS2 with various TM precursors. It is found that 1T-SMoS2 is more active than corresponding 2H-SMoS2 and the inclusion of 3 wt % Pt or Pd can also further enhance the HER activity. STEM-EELS and XAS show that the active single TM atom doping on this surface accounts for the high activity. Kinetic and DFT analyses also illustrate that the metallic nature of 1T-SMoS2 greatly facilitates the proton reduction step from water, rendering it non-rate-limiting in contrast to that of 2H-SMoS2. The inclusion of the TM single doper such as Pd, despite at low loading, can offer the dramatic acceleration of the rate limiting recombination of H to H2. As a result, a bifunctional catalysis for HER over this tailored composite structure is demonstrated that outperforms most reported catalysts in this area.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.9b01503
Single molybdenum center supported on N-doped black phosphorus as an efficient electrocatalyst for nitrogen fixation,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most significant industrial chemical products due to its wide applications in various fields. However, the production of NH3 from the electrochemical nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is one of the most important issues that remain challenging for chemists. Herein, the candidacy of a series of molybdenum (Mo)-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) supported on N-doped black phosphorus (BP) as the electrocatalyst for the NRR has been evaluated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In particular, Mo1N3 has been found to chemically adsorb N2, and it exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward the NRR with an ultralow overpotential of 0.02 V via the associative distal mechanism, indicative of catalyzing the NRR under ambient conditions. Additionally, Mo1N3 shows the fast removal of the produced NH3 with a free energy uphill of only 0.56 eV and good stability of NRR intermediates. Moreover, the Mo-based SACs were demonstrated to be more selective to the NRR over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. These excellent features render Mo1N3 on BP as a compelling highly efficient and durable catalyst for electrochemical N2 fixation. Our results provide a rational paradigm for catalytic nitrogen fixation by SACs in two-dimensional (2D) materials under ambient conditions.",Nanoscale,10.1039/c9nr02586c
Tunable Synthesis of Hollow Metal-Nitrogen-Carbon Capsules for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Catalysis in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells,"© Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society.Atomically dispersed metal catalysts anchored on nitrogen-doped (N-doped) carbons demand attention due to their superior catalytic activity relative to that of metal nanoparticle catalysts in energy storage and conversion processes. Herein, we introduce a simple and versatile strategy for the synthesis of hollow N-doped carbon capsules that contain one or more atomically dispersed metals (denoted as H-M-Nx-C and H-Mmix-Nx-C, respectively, where M = Fe, Co, or Ni). This method utilizes the pyrolysis of nanostructured core-shell precursors produced by coating a zeolitic imidazolate framework core with a metal-tannic acid (M-TA) coordination polymer shell (containing up to three different metal cations). Pyrolysis of these core-shell precursors affords hollow N-doped carbon capsules containing monometal sites (e.g., Fe-Nx, CoNx, or Ni-Nx) or multimetal sites (Fe/Co-Nx, Fe/Ni-Nx, Co/Ni-Nx, or Fe/Co/Ni-Nx). This inventory allowed exploration of the relationship between catalyst composition and electrochemical activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic solution. H-Fe-Nx-C, H-Co-Nx-C, H-FeCo-Nx-C, H-FeNi-Nx-C, and H-FeCoNi-Nx-C were particularly efficient ORR catalysts in acidic solution. Furthermore, the H-Fe-Nx-C catalyst exhibited outstanding initial performance when applied as a cathode material in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The synthetic methodology introduced here thus provides a convenient route for developing next-generation catalysts based on earth-abundant components.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.9b02930
High-Performance Hydrogen Evolution by Ru Single Atoms and Nitrided-Ru Nanoparticles Implanted on N-Doped Graphitic Sheet,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe most efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a Pt-based catalyst, but its high cost and nonperfect efficiency hinder wide-ranging industrial/technological applications. Here, an electrocatalyst of both ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) and N-doped-graphitic(GN)-shell-covered nitrided-Ru nanoparticles (NPs) (having a Ru-Nx shell) embedded on melamine-derived GN matrix {1: [Ru(SA)+Ru(NP)@RuNx@GN]/GN}, which exhibits superior HER activity in both acidic and basic media, is presented. In 0.5 m H2SO4/1 m KOH solutions, 1 shows diminutive “negative overpotentials” (−η = |η| = 10/7 mV at 10 mA cm−2, lowest ever) and high exchange current densities (4.70/1.96 mA cm−2). The remarkable HER performance is attributed to the near-zero free energies for hydrogen adsorption/desorption on Ru(SAs) and the increased conductivity of melamine-derived GN sheets by the presence of nitrided-Ru(NPs). The nitridation process forming nitrided-Ru(NPs), which are imperfectly covered by a GN shell, allows superb long-term operation durability. The catalyst splits water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen at 1.50/1.40 V (in 0.1 m HClO4/1 m KOH), demonstrating its potential as a ready-to-use, highly effective energy device for industrial applications.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201900931
Fe and N Co-Doped Porous Carbon Nanospheres with High Density of Active Sites for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.To enhance the electrocatalytic performance of transition metal and nitrogen codoped carbon (M-N-C) for the CO2 electroreduction reaction, we present a Fe and N codoped porous carbon nanosphere (Fe-N-PC) with a high density of single-atom iron active sites and a few Fe clusters, as indicated by high-resolution TEM and EXAFS, using SiO2 as the protecting shell to restrict isolated Fe atoms and to trap the volatile N-containing species. The Fe doping content can reach as high as 3.9 wt %. The Fe-N-PC catalyst exhibits an excellent performance for converting CO2 to CO with high Faradaic efficiency (∼90%) and remarkable partial CO current density (11.44 mA cm-2) at -0.49 V. Probing analysis and selective chemical modification reveal that both Fe atom and ortho-C of N atoms play a synergetic role in enhancing CO2RR activity. DFT calculations reveal that the presence of amorphous Fe clusters can facilitate the desorption of CO from the surface of the catalyst, thus further improving the CO2RR activity. This work presents a general strategy to synthesize advanced M-N-C material with high density of single atom active sites, which could be used as an efficient electrocatalyst for CO2RR, ORR et al.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b02195
Tailoring Electronic Structure of Atomically Dispersed Metal-N3S1 Active Sites for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Catalysis,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Rational design of oxygen electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and long-term durability is currently a severe challenge for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Here, we highlighted an electronic structure engineering on Cu-based catalyst with atomically dispersed Cu-N3S1 active sites, representing as highly active electrode material for oxygen reduction. The structurally-new Cu-N3S1 species shows unique electron interactions with both phosphorus atoms/carbon support, which not only activate the electron transfer around the Cu-N3S1 sites but also enhance the interaction with oxygenated species, resulting in a promoting reaction kinetics process. As expected, this catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity for oxygen reduction and evolution. A rechargeable flexible solid Zn-air battery based on this catalyst behaves superior performance of a high open-circuit voltage (1.41 V), a large power density (138.2 mW/cm2), and a small charge/discharge voltage gap (0.72 V at 2.0 mA cm-2) even under different bending angles. Specifically, this strategy is general and can be extended to other metal single atom catalyst systems (such as Fe-N3S1 species). This work will open a new avenue to design structurally-new single atom catalysts for energy-related field.",ACS Materials Letters,10.1021/acsmaterialslett.9b00094
High-performance single atom bifunctional oxygen catalysts derived from ZIF-67 superstructures,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdSingle-atom catalysts (SACs)always exhibit distinctive catalytic activities for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER), making SACs relevant in a number of crucial applications including fuel cells, metal-air batteries, as well as in industrial applications. Recently, fabricating SACs with rich multidimensional nanoarchitectures has become fascinating but challenging. Here, for the first time, we explore a facile and practicable “sacrificed-template” method to prepare cobalt single-atom electrocatalysts with Urchin-like Nano-Tube hierarchical structures (UNT Co SAs/N-C)derived from well-aligned metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs)superstructure (UNT ZIF-67). The as-prepared UNT Co SAs/N-C catalysts exhibit superior performance both in ORR/OER. XAFS and density functional theory (DFT)calculations reveal that outstanding catalytic activities stem from high-quality single-atom dispersion, precise local coordination of CoN4, and well-aligned carbon matrix based on MOFs superstructures. Our work provides new perspective in enriching SACs synthesis methodologies.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.076
Active Sites on Heterogeneous Single-Iron-Atom Electrocatalysts in CO2 Reduction Reaction,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Nitrogen-coordinated single-metal-atom catalysts (Me-N-C) are promising candidates for CO2-to-CO electrocatalytic conversion. The nature of real active sites in this type of electrocatalyst, however, is not clear. In this Letter, we study the specific interactions between the reaction intermediates and a model single-iron-atom catalyst (Fe-N-C) by combining in situ infrared absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For the first time, we confirm that the Fe centers in Fe-N4 moieties hosted by the complete graphitic layer are poisoned by strongly adsorbed CO and should not be the real active sites for gaseous CO production. Further DFT calculation results suggest that the high CO selectivity and reaction rate may originate from Fe-N4 moieties embedded in a defective graphitic layer that have balanced binding energies of adsorbed COOH and CO species. These findings add significant new insights into the mechanisms of CO2 reduction on carbon-based single-atom electrocatalysts.",ACS Energy Letters,10.1021/acsenergylett.9b01015
Building Up a Picture of the Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Activity of Transition Metal Single-Atom Catalysts,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.The lack of chemical understanding and efficient catalysts impedes the development of electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) for ammonia production. In this work, we employed density functional theory calculations to build up a picture (activity trends, electronic origins, and design strategies) of single-atom catalysts (SACs) supported on nitrogen-doped carbons as eNRR electrocatalysts. To construct such a picture, this work presents systematic studies of the eNRR activity of SACs covering 20 different transition metal (TM) centers coordinated by nitrogen atoms contained in three types of nitrogen-doped carbon substrates, which gives 60 SACs. Our study shows that the intrinsic activity trends could be established on the basis of the nitrogen adatom adsorption energy (ΔEN∗). Furthermore, the influence of metal and support (ligands) on ΔEN∗ proved to be related to the bonding/antibonding orbital population and regulating the scaling relations for adsorption of intermediates, respectively. Accordingly, a two-step strategy is proposed for improving the eNNR activity of TM-SACs, which involves the following: (i) selection of the most promising family of SACs (g-C3N4 supported SACs as predicted in this work) and (ii) further improvement of the activity of the best candidate in the aforementioned family via tuning the adsorption strength of the key intermediates. Also, the stability of N-doped carbon supports and their selectivity in comparison to the competing hydrogen evolution need to be taken into consideration for screening the durable and efficient candidates. Finally, an effective strategy for designing active, stable, and selective SACs based on the mechanistic insights is elaborated to guide future eNRR studies.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.9b03811
Single atomic Ag enhances the bifunctional activity and cycling stability of MnO2,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Heterogeneous electrocatalyst with single atom feature has attracted great interests. Although significant progress has been made on constructing and understanding carbon supported single atom electrocatalysts (SAECs), few attentions has been paid to metal oxide supported SAECs. The effect of single atom in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and stability of metal oxides has been poorly understood. Here, we reported MnO2 nanowires loaded with single atomic Ag (Ag-MnO2) that can simultaneously catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The incorporation of Ag into the crystal framework of α-MnO2 provided multiple benefits including an improved conductivity and a substantial increase in both lattice distortion and oxygen vacancies. As a result, Ag-MnO2 outperformed α-MnO2 in oxygen electrocatalysis and showed ∼3-fold enhancement in kinetic current density. The Zinc air battery containing the Ag-MnO2 displayed a high discharge peak power of 273.2 mW cm−2, an energy density of 915.4 Wh kgZn−1 and an outstanding rate performance. The Zinc air battery (ZAB) stably operated up to 3200 cycles of charge-discharge. Such excellent rechargeability can be ascribed to the promoted crystal phase transformation from α-MnO2 to δ-MnO2 that is beneficial for OER due to the presence of atomic Ag.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2019.02.084

All rights reserved.Currently, the most active electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2 to CO are gold-based nanomaterials, whereas non–precious metal catalysts have shown low to modest activity. Here, we report a catalyst of dispersed single-atom iron sites that produces CO at an overpotential as low as 80 millivolts. Partial current density reaches 94 milliamperes per square centimeter at an overpotential of 340 millivolts. Operando x-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the active sites to be discrete Fe3+ ions, coordinated to pyrrolic nitrogen (N) atoms of the N-doped carbon support, that maintain their +3 oxidation state during electrocatalysis, probably through electronic coupling to the conductive carbon support. Electrochemical data suggest that the Fe3+ sites derive their superior activity from faster CO2 adsorption and weaker CO absorption than that of conventional Fe2+ sites.",Science,10.1126/science.aaw7515
"Single Fe Atom on Hierarchically Porous S, N-Codoped Nanocarbon Derived from Porphyra Enable Boosted Oxygen Catalysis for Rechargeable Zn-Air Batteries","© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimIron–nitrogen–carbon materials (Fe–N–C) are known for their excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. Unfortunately, they generally show a laggard oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, which results in a lethargic charging performance in rechargeable Zn–air batteries. Here porous S-doped Fe–N–C nanosheets are innovatively synthesized utilizing a scalable FeCl3-encapsulated-porphyra precursor pyrolysis strategy. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits ultrahigh ORR activity (E1/2 = 0.84 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and impressive OER performance (Ej= 10 = 1.64 V). The potential gap (ΔE = Ej= 10 − E1/2) is 0.80 V, outperforming that of most highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. Furthermore, the key role of S involved in the atomically dispersed Fe–Nx species on the enhanced ORR and OER activities is expounded for the first time by ultrasound-assisted extraction of the exclusive S source (taurine) from porphyra. Moreover, the assembled rechargeable Zn–air battery comprising this bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits higher power density (225.1 mW cm−2) and lower charging–discharging overpotential (1.00 V, 100 mA cm−2 compared to Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst). The design strategy can expand the utilization of earth-abundant biomaterial-derived catalysts, and the mechanism investigations of S doping on the structure–activity relationship can inspire the progress of other functional electrocatalysts.",Small,10.1002/smll.201900307
Single Mo atoms supported on N-Doped carbon with N/C edge-site for enhanced electrochemical hydrogen evolution,"© 2019Atomic transition metal–nitrogen in carbon (TMNC), as single-atom catalysts employing in electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), has recently sparked broad research interests, but the effects of the edge-site N/C atoms neighboring TMNC moieties on catalytic HER performance are less investigated. Herein, by employing first-principles computations, we have established a series of TMN1C (TM = Cu, Mo, and Pt)nanoarchitectures as electrocatalysts for HER. It is found that the MoN1C is the best catalyst for HER with the calculated Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*)of 0.038 eV. We further construct various N/C edge-sites around the Mo atom on the MoN1C catalyst, which endow tunable structures and selective exposure of interior active sites. These N/C edge-sites alter the charge density distribution of catalytic active sites and affect the distortion of the TMN1C catalysts as well as the structures of intermediate hydrogen adsorption. Their catalytic activities are further enhanced. The work is suggestive of a new approach for the edge-site engineering of geometric and electronic structures of TMNC to optimize their catalytic activities.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.056
Phthalocyanine precursors to construct atomically dispersed iron electrocatalysts,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Carbon materials embedded with atomically dispersed metal sites have recently demonstrated intriguing performance as electrocatalysts. However, it remains challenging to construct abundant single metal atoms due to easy aggregation of metal species during the high-temperature synthesis. Herein, a facile method is devloped to construct single iron atom electrocatalysts with high iron content by employing iron phthalocyanine (FePc) derivatives as metal precursors. FePc molecules are encapsulated into the zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), and the subsequent pyrolysis yields the catalysts. Cyano substitution on FePc (FePc(CN)8) can facilitate introduction of phthalocyanine molecules and formation of active sites, thus affording higher activity for the oxygen reduction reaction than the FePc counterpart. It is also found that adding iron salt with FePc(CN)8 can afford a better catalyst with enhanced surface Fe-Nx content, which exhibits high activities with a half-wave potential of 0.910 and 0.811 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. Moreover, FePc(CN)8/ZIF-derived catalyst exhibits high selectivities and good activities for carbon monoxide production in the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The bulk Fe-Nx sites are found to be more stable than the surface Fe-Nx sites possibly due to the improved desorption of carbon monoxide.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.9b01617
Computational Screening of Efficient Single-Atom Catalysts Based on Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g-C3N4) for Nitrogen Electroreduction,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe development of low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) at ambient conditions is crucial for NH3 synthesis and provides an alternative to the traditional Harber-Bosch process. Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, the catalytic performance of a series of single metal atoms supported on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for NRR is evaluated. Among all the candidates, the Gibbs free energy change of the potential-determining step for five single-atom catalysts (SACs), namely Ti, Co, Mo, W, and Pt atoms supported on g-C3N4 monolayer, is lower than that on the Ru(0001) stepped surface. In particular, the single tungsten (W) atom anchored on g-C3N4 (W@g-C3N4) exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward NRR with a limiting potential of −0.35 V via associative enzymatic pathway, and can well suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The high NRR activity and selectivity of W@g-C3N4 are attributed to its inherent properties, such as significant positive charge and large spin moment on the W atom, excellent electrical conductivity, and moderate adsorption strength with NRR intermediates. This work opens up a new avenue of N2 reduction for renewable energy supplies and helps guide future development of single-atom catalysts for NRR and other related electrochemical process.",Small Methods,10.1002/smtd.201800368
Atomically dispersed platinum supported on curved carbon supports for efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.Dispersing catalytically active metals as single atoms on supports represents the ultimate in metal utilization efficiency and is increasingly being used as a strategy to design hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Although platinum (Pt) is highly active for HER, given its high cost it is desirable to find ways to improve performance further while minimizing the Pt loading. Here, we use onion-like nanospheres of carbon (OLC) to anchor stable atomically dispersed Pt to act as a catalyst (Pt1/OLC) for the HER. In acidic media, the performance of the Pt1/OLC catalyst (0.27 wt% Pt) in terms of a low overpotential (38 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and high turnover frequencies (40.78 H2 s−1 at 100 mV) is better than that of a graphene-supported single-atom catalyst with a similar Pt loading, and comparable to a commercial Pt/C catalyst with 20 wt% Pt. First-principle calculations suggest that a tip-enhanced local electric field at the Pt site on the curved support promotes the reaction kinetics for hydrogen evolution.",Nature Energy,10.1038/s41560-019-0402-6

High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) combined with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) verifies that the Fe species are present as Fe-N4 coordination at an atomic level in the CeF3-Fe/N/C catalyst. A high-spin Fe3+-N4 configuration in the nitrogen-doped carbon revealed by 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum and X-ray absorption spectroscopy for Fe L-edge, which will contribute to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in acid electrolyte. CeF3 embedded into the structure of Fe/N/C not only form the oxophilic interface, but also regulate the surface chemical state of Fe and Ce species as well as boosting ORR in acidic solution. The presence of Ce3+ sites at the CeF3-Fe/N/C hybrid catalyst could enhance the O2 adsorption capability and promote H2O2 reducing to water efficiently, thus greatly improve of the electrochemical performance and durability of Fe/N/C catalyst is demonstrated in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC).",Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.028
Coordination-controlled single-atom tungsten as a non-3d-metal oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst with ultrahigh mass activity,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Transition metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) catalysts have emerged as the most promising alternatives to their costly platinum–based counterparts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis, which are critical to renewable energy conversion and storage technologies. However, thus far, only 3d transition metals (Co, Fe, Ni, Mn, etc.) have often been good choices for the metal elements in such M-N-C catalysts, while other non-3d transition metals-based catalysts such as 5d tungsten (W) usually afford much inferior ORR activities in both bulk and nanoparticle form. Here, we report the atomically dispersed tungsten on nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets with controlled W-N coordination numbers as efficient catalysts for ORRs, which are only formed through the deliberate modulation of the synthesis parameters, such as the pyrolysis atmosphere, temperature, and time, within a very narrow range. Instead of being considered to be almost inactive towards ORR, the single-atom tungsten electrocatalysts show remarkable, durable and coordination number-sensitive ORR catalytic ability. It is shown that single-atom tungsten with a W-N coordination number of 5 exhibits markedly high ORR catalytic activity in 0.1 M KOH with onset potential (∼1.01 V), half-wave potential (0.88 V) and a mass activity of 0.63 A/mg (at 0.9 V versus RHE), which even surpasses those of commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, the WN 5 catalyst catalyzes the ORR with a onset potential of 0.87 V and a half-wave potential of 0.77V in 0.1 M HClO 4 , both of which are nearly comparable to the benchmark Pt/C. In contrast, the single-atom tungsten electrocatalysts with W-N coordination numbers of 3 and 4 exhibit relatively poor ORR activity in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The DFT calculations suggest that the sharp increase in the ORR activity of the single-atom tungsten catalysts can be attributed to the moderate interaction between OH- and the single W atoms, which is probably caused by the optimal dz 2 -pz orbital hybridization and re-distribution of the charges.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.03.045
Single and double boron atoms doped nanoporous C2N-h2D electrocatalysts for highly efficient N2 reduction reaction: A density functional theory study,"© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.The electrocatalytical process is the most efficient way to produce ammonia (NH3) under ambient conditions, but developing a highly efficient and low-cost metal-free electrocatalysts remains a major scientific challenge. Hence, single atom and double boron (B) atoms doped 2D graphene-like carbon nitride (C2N-h2D) electrocatalysts have been designed (B@C2N and B2@C2N), and the efficiency of N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is examined by density functional theory calculation. The results show that the single and double B atoms can both be strongly embedded in natural nanoporous C2N with superior catalytic activity for N2 activation. The reaction mechanisms of NRR on the B@C2N and B2@C2N are both following an enzymatic pathway, and B2@C2N is a more efficient electrocatalyst with extremely low overpotential of 0.19 eV comparing to B@C2N (0.29 eV). In the low energy region, the hydrogenation of N2 is thermodynamically more favorable than the hydrogen production, thereby improving the selectivity for NRR. Based on these results, a new double-atom strategy may help guiding the experimental synthesis of highly efficient NRR electrocatalysts.",Nanotechnology,10.1088/1361-6528/ab1d01
Ruthenium-Based Single-Atom Alloy with High Electrocatalytic Activity for Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The SAA exhibits a high stability and a low overpotential, 24 mV@10 mA cm−2, which is much lower than that of a Pt/C catalyst (46 mV) in alkaline media. Moreover, the turnover frequency of RuAu SAA is three times that of Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory computation indicates the excellent catalytic activity of RuAu SAAs originates from the relay catalysis of Ru and Au active sites. This work opens a new avenue toward high-performance SAAs via fast quenching of immiscible metals.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201803913

The catalyst exhibits high selectivity with CO Faradaic efficiency above 90 % over a wide potential range from −0.5 to −0.9 V (98 % at −0.7 V), and robust durability, retaining 99 % of its initial selectivity after 30 hours of electrolysis. Density functional theory studies reveal that the neighboring Ni-Fe centers not only function in synergy to decrease the reaction barrier for the formation of COOH* and desorption of CO, but also undergo distinct structural evolution into a CO-adsorbed moiety upon CO2 uptake.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201901575

Single-atom electrocatalysts with maximum atom efficiency are highly considered as an alternative of the present noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. However, the fabrication of transition metal single-atoms is very challenging, requiring extensive attempts of precursors with novel design principles. Herein, an all-covalently constructed cobalt-coordinated framework porphyrin with graphene hybridization is innovatively designed and prepared as the pyrolysis precursor to fabricate single-atom Co–N x –C electrocatalysts. Excellent electrochemical performances are realized for both bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and rechargeable Zn–air batteries with regard to reduced overpotentials, improved kinetics, and prolonged cycling stability comparable with noble-metal-based electrocatalysts.

Fabricating Single-Atom Catalysts from Chelating Metal in Open Frameworks,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimIn the present study, a highly efficient strategy is reported using open framework platforms with abundant chelating ligands to fabricate a series of stable metal single-atom catalysts (SACs). Here, the metal ions are initially anchored onto the active bipyridine sites through postsynthetic modification, followed by pyrolysis and acid leaching. The resulting single metal atoms are uniformly distributed on a nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) matrix. Interestingly, each metal atom is found to be coordinated with five N atoms, in contrast to the average coordination number of four as previously reported. The as-prepared Fe SAC/N-C catalyst exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity (with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V), outstanding stability, and good methanol tolerance. The density functional calculations reveal that the coordinated pyridine can favorably modulate the interaction strength of oxygen on the Fe ion and thus improve the ORR activity. More importantly, it is demonstrated that this strategy can be successfully extended to the preparation of other transition metal SACs, simply by altering the metal precursors used in the metalation step.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.201808193
Facile chemical-vapour-deposition synthesis of vertically aligned co-doped MoS2 nanosheets as an efficient catalyst for triiodide reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2019 Elsevier Inc.A combination of high surface area, fast-speed charge transportation, excellent intrinsic activity, and low material cost is desired for electrocatalysts’ applications, such as hydrogen production, counter electrodes of electrochemical solar cells, etc. In this regard, we originally develop a vertically aligned Co-doped MoS2 nanosheet array via a facile chemical vapour deposition (CVD) approach that utilizes the reaction between drop-coated CoCl2-MoCl5 precursor film and sulfur vapour released from elemental sulfur powder. Such structure that exposes primarily edge sites of the nanosheets provides reaction with more active centers and guarantees that electrons transport almost along high-electron-mobility basal plane of MoS2. Simultaneously, the catalytic activity of the in-plane S atoms of MoS2, exposing at the splits of MoS2 nanosheets, can be triggered via Co atom-doping. Such an array that is in-situ grown on graphite foil substrate performs as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 185 mV at a current density of 10 mA·cm−2 and an extremely high TOF 0.56 s−1 at 200 mV overpotential, meanwhile, sponsoring as a counter electrode for efficient (8.99%) dye-sensitized solar cells.",Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.007

KGaA, WeinheimMetal single-atom materials with their high atom utilization efficiency and unique electronic structures usually show remarkable catalytic performances in many crucial chemical reactions. Herein, a facile and easily scalable “impregnation-carbonization-acidification” strategy for fabricating a class of single-atom-anchored (including cobalt and nickel single atoms) monolith as superior binder-free electrocatalysts for developing high-performance wearable Zn–air batteries is reported. The as-prepared single atoms, supported by N-doped carbon flake arrays grown on carbon nanofibers assembly (M SA@NCF/CNF), demonstrate the dual characteristics of excellent catalytic activity (reversible oxygen overpotential of 0.75 V) and high stability, owing to the greatly improved active sites' accessibility and optimized single-sites/pore-structures correlations. Furthermore, wearable Zn–air battery based on Co SA@NCF/CNF air electrode displays superior stability under deformation, satisfactory energy storage capacity, and good practicality to be utilized as an integrated battery system. Theoretical calculations reveal a mechanism for the promotion of the catalytic performances on single atomic sites by lowering the overall oxygen reduction/evolution reaction barriers comparing to metal cluster co-existing configuration. These findings provide a facile strategy for constructing free-standing single-atom materials as well as the engineering of high-performance binder-free catalytic electrodes.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.201808267
"Mo isolated single atoms on S, N-codoped carbon as efficient catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction: A theoretical evaluation","© 2018 The high-efficient electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a promising pathway to provide clean energy. An electrocatalyst was computer-aided designed with Mo isolated single atoms (Mo-ISA) supported on heteroatom S, N-codoped carbon having excellent HER performance. Here, by performing comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we investigated the influence of the N dopent concentration and the sites of S atom doping on the HER performance. Our computed results demonstrate that the Mo-ISA/N1C and Mo-ISA/S 6 N1C catalysts possess good stability and high HER reactivity. Moreover, the interactions between hydrogen and the Mo atoms could be controlled by the N dopent concentration on carbon support, and the Mo-ISA/N1C catalyst showed best HER reactivity. In particular, the S atom was introduced into Mo-ISA/N1C at the S 6 site showing an enhanced HER performance due to the competitive effect of the S-induced tensile strain and charge transfer.

Efficient and Robust Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction Enabled by Atomically Dispersed Sn δ + Sites,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction at considerably low overpotentials still remains a great challenge. Here, a positively charged single-atom metal electrocatalyst to largely reduce the overpotentials is designed and hence CO 2 electroreduction performance is accelerated. Taking the metal Sn as an example, kilogram-scale single-atom Sn δ + on N-doped graphene is first fabricated by a quick freeze–vacuum drying–calcination method. Synchrotron-radiation X-ray absorption fine structure and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrate the atomically dispersed Sn atoms are positively charged, which enables CO 2 activation and protonation to proceed spontaneously through stabilizing CO 2 •− * and HCOO − *, affirmed by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra and Gibbs free energy calculations. Furthermore, N-doping facilitates the rate-limiting formate desorption step, verified by the decreased desorption energy from 2.16 to 1.01 eV and the elongated SnHCOO − bond length. As an result, single-atom Sn δ + on N-doped graphene exhibits a very low onset overpotential down to 60 mV for formate production and shows a very large turnover frequency up to 11930 h −1 , while its electroreduction activity proceeds without deactivation even after 200 h.

Single Mo1(Cr1) Atom on Nitrogen-Doped Graphene Enables Highly Selective Electroreduction of Nitrogen into Ammonia,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Searching for new types of electrocatalysts with high stability, activity, and selectivity is essential for the production of ammonia via electroreduction of nitrogen. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explore the stability of single metal atoms (M1) supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (N3-G); the competitive adsorption of dinitrogen and hydrogen; and the potential competition of first dinitrogen protonation and hydrogen adsorption on metal sites. Consequently, we identify Mo1/N3-G and Cr1/N3-G as candidate electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). The theoretically predicted selectivities (overpotentials) are 40% (0.34 V) and 100% (0.59 V) on Mo1/N3-G and Cr1/N3-G, respectively. The electroreduction of nitrogen proceeds via distal-to-alternating hybrid mechanism with two spectator dinitrogen molecules. The high stability, high selectivity to ammonia, and relatively low overpotentials for NRR suggest Mo1(Cr1)/N3-G as the most promising electrocatalyst among those studied for electroreduction of nitrogen.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.8b05061
A general route via formamide condensation to prepare atomically dispersed metal-nitrogen-carbon electrocatalysts for energy technologies,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Single-atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) have gained tremendous attention due to their unique active sites and strong metal-substrate interactions. However, the current synthesis of SAECs mostly relies on costly precursors and rigid synthetic conditions and often results in very low content of single-site metal atoms. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis method to prepare metal-nitrogen-carbon SAECs based on formamide condensation and carbonization, featuring a cost-effective general methodology for the mass production of SAECs with high loading of atomically dispersed metal sites. The products with metal inclusion were termed as formamide-converted metal-nitrogen-carbon (shortened as f-MNC) materials. Seven types of single-metallic f-MNC (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Zn, Mo and Ir), two bi-metallic (ZnFe and ZnCo) and one tri-metallic (ZnFeCo) SAECs were synthesized to demonstrate the generality of the methodology developed. Remarkably, these f-MNC SAECs can be coated onto various supports with an ultrathin layer as pyrolysis-free electrocatalysts, among which the carbon nanotube-supported f-FeNC and f-NiNC SAECs showed high performance for the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), respectively. Furthermore, the pyrolysis products of supported f-MNC can still render isolated metallic sites with excellent activity, as exemplified by the bi-metallic f-FeCoNC SAEC, which exhibited outstanding ORR performance in both alkaline and acid electrolytes by delivering ∼70 and ∼20 mV higher half-wave potentials than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C, respectively. This work offers a feasible approach to design and manufacture SAECs with tuneable atomic metal components and high density of single-site metal loading, and thus may accelerate the deployment of SAECs for various energy technology applications.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/c9ee00162j

Single-atom precious metal catalysts hold the promise of perfect atom utilization, yet control of their activity and stability remains challenging. Here we show that engineering the electronic structure of atomically dispersed Ru 1 on metal supports via compressive strain boosts the kinetically sluggish electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and mitigates the degradation of Ru-based electrocatalysts in an acidic electrolyte. We construct a series of alloy-supported Ru 1 using different PtCu alloys through sequential acid etching and electrochemical leaching, and find a volcano relation between OER activity and the lattice constant of the PtCu alloys. Our best catalyst, Ru 1 –Pt 3 Cu, delivers 90 mV lower overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , and an order of magnitude longer lifetime over that of commercial RuO 2 . Density functional theory investigations reveal that the compressive strain of the Pt skin shell engineers the electronic structure of the Ru 1 , allowing optimized binding of oxygen species and better resistance to over-oxidation and dissolution.",Nature Catalysis,10.1038/s41929-019-0246-2
Design of active bifunctional electrocatalysts using single atom doped transition metal dichalcogenides,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. Single atom catalyst is designed to achieve high catalytic activity while extremely minimizing precious metal loadings for electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we screen 48 combinations of single atom catalysts anchored at defective monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (A 1 /TMD; A = Ni, Cu, Pd, Ag, Pt and Au; TM = Mo, W, Nb and Ta; D = S and Se). With established methodologies, we identify five best catalysts for each of oxygen reduction/evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions among the stable candidates. A scaling relation between the Gibb's free energy for intermediates is figured out to understand the governing mechanism of single atom catalysts with varying transition metal dichalcogenides supports and to introduce key descriptor. Pt 1 /MoS 2 is proposed as the best bifunctional catalyst for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. In addition, Pt 1 /NbSe 2 and Pt 1 /TaS 2 are promising candidates for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. Treating the support itself as an active site for hydrogen evolution reaction, Pd 1 /NbS 2 and Pt 1 /NbS 2 are proposed as potential bifunctional catalysts toward oxygen reduction and evolution reaction, respectively.

Unexpected monoatomic catalytic-host synergetic OER/ORR by graphitic carbon nitride: Density functional theory,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Although single metal atoms (SMAs) have been extensively investigated as unique active sites in single-atom catalysts, the possible active sites of the host catalysts have been unfortunately neglected in previous studies. In single-atom catalysts, the SMAs can promote the chemical and catalytic activities of host atoms, which may act as secondary active sites, resulting in a significant synergistic effect on the catalytic performance. Using density functional theory calculations, we studied the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on two different types of active sites: single metal (M1) atoms and the neighboring host atoms of several M1/g-C3N4 samples. The contributions of M1 and host atoms towards the reduction of the OER/ORR overpotentials of Fe1, Co1, Ni1, Cu1 and Zn1/g-C3N4, bifunctional electrocatalysts with the OER/ORR overpotentials of 0.50-0.70 V were investigated. Finally, new M1/g-C3N4 catalysts with high OER/ORR performances could be estimated based on the d-band centre of the M1 atoms in the future.",Nanoscale,10.1039/c8nr09300h
Rational Design of Graphene-Supported Single Atom Catalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim The proper choice of nonprecious transition metals as single atom catalysts (SACs) remains unclear for designing highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, reported is an activity correlation with catalysts, electronic structure, in order to clarify the origin of reactivity for a series of transition metals supported on nitrogen-doped graphene as SACs for HER by a combination of density functional theory calculations and electrochemical measurements. Only few of the transition metals (e.g., Co, Cr, Fe, Rh, and V) as SACs show good catalytic activity toward HER as their Gibbs free energies are varied between the range of –0.20 to 0.30 eV but among which Co-SAC exhibits the highest electrochemical activity at 0.13 eV. Electronic structure studies show that the energy states of active valence d z 2 orbitals and their resulting antibonding state determine the catalytic activity for HER. The fact that the antibonding state orbital is neither completely empty nor fully filled in the case of Co-SAC is the main reason for its ideal hydrogen adsorption energy. Moreover, the electrochemical measurement shows that Co-SAC exhibits a superior hydrogen evolution activity over Ni-SAC and W-SAC, confirming the theoretical calculation.

Cobalt in Nitrogen-Doped Graphene as Single-Atom Catalyst for High-Sulfur Content Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Because of their high theoretical energy density and low cost, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are promising next-generation energy storage devices. The electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries largely depends on the efficient reversible conversion of Li polysulfides to Li2S in discharge and to elemental S during charging. Here, we report on our discovery that monodisperse cobalt atoms embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene (Co-N/G) can trigger the surface-mediated reaction of Li polysulfides. Using a combination of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first-principles calculation, we reveal that the Co-N-C coordination center serves as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to facilitate both the formation and the decomposition of Li2S in discharge and charge processes, respectively. The S@Co-N/G composite, with a high S mass ratio of 90 wt %, can deliver a gravimetric capacity of 1210 mAh g-1, and it exhibits an areal capacity of 5.1 mAh cm-2 with capacity fading rate of 0.029% per cycle over 100 cycles at 0.2 C at S loading of 6.0 mg cm-2 on the electrode disk.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.8b12973
Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Methane on Single Transition Metal Atoms Supported on a Defective Boron Nitride Monolayer: First Principle Study,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water into useful multi-electron transfer products, such as methanol (CH3OH) and methane (CH4), is a major challenge in facilitating a closed carbon cycle. Here, a systematic first principle study of the potential of single transition metal atoms (Sc to Zn, Mo, Rh, Ru, Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au) supported on experimentally available defective boron nitride monolayers with a boron monovacancy (TM/defective BN) to achieve highly efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) to CH4 is carried out. Our computations reveal that Fe/defective BN, Co/defective BN, and Pt/defective BN nanosheets possess outstanding ECR activities with quite low (less negative) onset potentials of −0.52, −0.68, and −0.60 V, respectively. Given that Fe and Co are nonprecious metals, Fe/defective BN and Co/defective BN may provide cost-effective electrocatalysts. The high ECR activities of these TM/defective BN catalyst systems stem from the moderate electrocatalysts’ affinities for C and O, which modulate the free energies of ECR intermediates in the reaction pathways. Moreover, it is found that Fe/defective BN and Pt/defective BN show high selectivity of ECR to CH4. This finding highlights a strategy to design highly active and selective single-atom electrocatalysts for ECR to CH4.",Advanced Theory and Simulations,10.1002/adts.201800094

Highly stable single Pt atomic sites anchored on aniline-stacked graphene for hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Developing efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is highly desired for the hydrogen economy. In this study, we developed a facile microwave reduction method to synthesize single Pt atoms anchored on aniline-stacked graphene (Pt SASs/AG) with outstanding HER performance. Pt SASs/AG presents excellent HER activity with η = 12 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a mass current density of 22400 AgPt-1 at η = 50 mV, which is 46 times higher than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. Moreover, the Pt SASs/AG catalyst is highly active and more stable than Pt/C. X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the coordination of atomically isolated Pt with the nitrogen of aniline optimized the electronic structure of Pt and the hydrogen adsorption energy, eventually promoting HER activity. This study provides a new avenue for the development of single-atom Pt electrocatalysts with high activity and stability.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/c8ee02888e
Fe–N–C electrocatalyst with dense active sites and efficient mass transport for high-performance proton exchange membrane fuel cells,"© 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.To achieve the US Department of Energy 2018 target set for platinum-group metal-free catalysts (PGM-free catalysts) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, the low density of active sites must be overcome. Here, we report a class of concave Fe–N–C single-atom catalysts possessing an enhanced external surface area and mesoporosity that meets the 2018 PGM-free catalyst activity target, and a current density of 0.047 A cm–2 at 0.88 ViR-free under 1.0 bar H2–O2. This performance stems from the high density of active sites, which is realized through exposing inaccessible Fe–N4 moieties (that is, increasing their utilization) and enhancing the mass transport of the catalyst layer. Further, we establish structure–property correlations that provide a route for designing highly efficient PGM-free catalysts for practical application, achieving a power density of 1.18 W cm−2 under 2.5 bar H2–O2, and an activity of 129 mA cm−2 at 0.8 ViR-free under 1.0 bar H2–air.",Nature Catalysis,10.1038/s41929-019-0237-3
1T-MoS 2 monolayer doped with isolated Ni atoms as highly active hydrogen evolution catalysts: A density functional study,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. The 1T phase of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been shown to be catalytically active during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the catalytic performance is greatly affected by the extent of surface coverage by H, due to the non-optimal bonding strength between H and the 1T-MoS 2 surface. In this work, the density functional theory was employed to predict a novel catalyst Ni-doped-1T-MoS 2 of HER. The improved performance of 1T-MoS 2 was believed to come from the change of the bond strength between S and H atoms, which is tailoring by the doping of transition metal Ni. More importantly, in contrast to undoped 1T-MoS 2 , the excellent catalytic performance of Ni-doped 1T-MoS 2 is only minimally affected by the extent of coverage by H. Based on density of states, crystal orbital Hamiltonian population and Bader charge analyses, this enhanced performance is attributed to the weakening of the S to H bond strength, which is conducive to H desorption. Based on an implicit solvation model, the catalytic activity of Ni-doped 1T-MoS 2 was also found to be less vulnerable to the presence of water. These findings are expected to facilitate the future design of single-atom electrocatalysts with high efficiency for the HER.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.11.040
Atomic Fe Dispersed on N-Doped Carbon Hollow Nanospheres for High-Efficiency Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Exploration of high-efficiency, economical, and ultrastable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to substitute precious Pt is of great significance in electrochemical energy conversion devices. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have sparked tremendous interest for their maximum atom-utilization efficiency and fascinating properties. Therefore, the development of effective synthetic methodology toward SACs becomes highly imperative yet still remains greatly challenging. Herein, a reliable SiO 2 -templated strategy is elaborately designed to synthesize atomically dispersed Fe atoms anchored on N-doped carbon nanospheres (denoted as Fe–N–C HNSs) using the cheap and sustainable biomaterial of histidine (His) as the N and C precursor. By virtue of the numerous atomically dispersed Fe–N 4 moieties and unique spherical hollow architecture, the as-fabricated Fe–N–C HNSs exhibit excellent ORR performance in alkaline medium with outstanding activity, high long-term stability, and superior tolerance to methanol crossover, exceeding the commercial Pt/C catalyst and most previously reported non-precious-metal catalysts. This present synthetic strategy will provide new inspiration to the fabrication of various high-efficiency single-atom catalysts for diverse applications.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.201806312
Cu-Based Single-Atom Catalysts Boost Electroreduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH: First-Principles Predictions,"© 2019 American Chemical Society. Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to fuels represents one of the most attractive approaches to mitigate our pressing energy and environmental threats. Cu is the best known metal catalyst that can produce an appreciable amount of hydrocarbons from CO 2 , but it suffers from a high overpotential and poor selectivity. In this work, by means of first-principles calculations, we predict that Cu-based single-atom alloys (SAAs) could be exceptional electrocatalysts for CO 2 RR. In particular, we predict that Co@Cu SAA could be a promising catalyst on which methanol can be produced at a low overpotential and high selectivity. The isolated Co atoms lead to a narrowed d-band and an upshifted d-band center which can stabilize chemisorbed CO 2 on a surface, significantly lowering the reaction barrier. The narrowed Co d-band increases the bonding to a key intermediate, which in turn eliminates the need for its migration and enables a selective and efficient production of CH 3 OH through the pathway of CO 2 â†' COOH∗ â†' CO∗ â†' COH∗ â†' CHOH∗ â†' CH 2 OH∗ â†' CH 3 OH.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b12449
Solid-Diffusion Synthesis of Single-Atom Catalysts Directly from Bulk Metal for Efficient CO 2 Reduction,"© 2018 Elsevier Inc. Electroreduction of CO 2 into value-added products is an effective approach to remit the environmental and energy issues. However, the development of an effective, accessible, and simple method for mass production of electrocatalyst is challenging. Herein, we demonstrate the solid-state diffusion between the N-doped carbon phase and bulk Ni metal can be utilized to synthesize hierarchical, self-supported, and atomistic catalyst. Strikingly, this hierarchical catalyst is programmable and scalable to meet the industrial demand and can be directly used as a binder-free electrode toward the CO 2 electroreduction, delivering a state-of-the-art current density of 48.66 mA cm −2 at −1.0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and high faradic efficiency of 97% to CO. The selectivity can be retained over 90% in a wide range of working potential of −0.7 to −1.2 V versus RHE. This solid-state diffusion strategy presents great potential to produce hierarchical and atomistic catalysts at industrial levels. The excessive emission of CO 2 through massive fossil fuel consumption results in serious environmental issues. There is an urgent need to convert CO 2 into chemical fuels to mitigate atmospheric CO 2 levels and alleviate the energy crisis. Therefore, the design and synthesis of high-performance and flexible self-supported electrocatalysts for CO 2 reduction are highly desirable to realize high-efficiency practical devices. Herein, we successfully synthesize a hierarchical and atomistic catalyst through a solid-state diffusion strategy. This synthesis is initiated by the direct solid-state diffusion of Ni atoms from bulk Ni foil into the contacted carbon shell. Catalyzed by the Ni “seeds” derived from the bulk Ni, self-supported nanotube fiber-based carbon paper decorated by abundant isolated atomistic Ni sites are successfully “cultivated.” This hierarchical catalyst is programmable and scalable to meet the industrial demand for CO 2 conversion.",Joule,10.1016/j.joule.2018.11.008
Platinum single atoms/clusters stabilized in transition metal oxides for enhanced electrocatalysis,"© 2018Tunable amount of monatomic and nanoscale Pt clusters were trapped in TiO2 and CeO2 nanowires via a generic one-step dealloying approach from designed Al-Ti-Pt and Al-Ce-Pt precursor alloys. It was demonstrated that the doped Pt were in the form of both single atoms and Pt clusters stabilized in TiO2 or CeO2 nanowires. Electrochemical tests manifested that these highly dispersed Pt doped metal oxide greatly enhanced the utilization efficiency of noble metals. When used as an electrocatalyst for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the Pt-TiO2 or Pt-CeO2 catalysts after activation exhibited much higher catalytic activity and stability as compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The highest mass activity of the Pt0.2-TiO2 catalysts obtained from dealloying Al85Ti14.8Pt0.2 reached 1200 mA mg−1 for MOR, more than six times higher than that of Pt/C. The mass activity of the Pt0.2-CeO2 for HER is around 50 times that of Pt/C. With clear advantages of low costs, simple fabrication procedure, and enhanced catalytic performance, these Pt-metal oxide nanowires can be suitable for many catalytic reactions.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.11.200
Atomically Dispersed Molybdenum Catalysts for Efficient Ambient Nitrogen Fixation,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim NH 3 synthesis by the electrocatalytic N 2 reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is an appealing alternative to the currently employed industrial method—the Haber–Bosch process—that requires high temperature and pressure. We report single Mo atoms anchored to nitrogen-doped porous carbon as a cost-effective catalyst for the NRR. Benefiting from the optimally high density of active sites and hierarchically porous carbon frameworks, this catalyst achieves a high NH 3 yield rate (34.0±3.6 μg NH3 h −1 mg cat. −1 ) and a high Faradaic efficiency (14.6±1.6 %) in 0.1 m KOH at room temperature. These values are considerably higher compared to previously reported non-precious-metal electrocatalysts. Moreover, this catalyst displays no obvious current drop during a 50 000 s NRR, and high activity and durability are achieved in 0.1 m HCl. The findings provide a promising lead for the design of efficient and robust single-atom non-precious-metal catalysts for the electrocatalytic NRR.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201811728
Single-atom supported on graphene grain boundary as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdEmbedding a single atom into the supported catalysts is the most effective way to maximize the catalytic efficiency, holding promise for developing low-cost electrocatalysts. Grain boundaries in graphene display unique structures and have attracted great research efforts in electronic properties, catalysis and sensors. By using density function theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigated the potential of a single transition metal (TM) atom (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, Au, Pt) supported on the experimentally realised 558 grain boundary (GB), as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We find that the Fe, Co, Ni and V atom anchored on 558 GB can substantially tune the free energy of hydrogen adsorption to a more optimal value, especially for the V atom (ΔGH∗ = −0.01 eV), which is very close to, or even better than the most active Pt and MoS2 catalysts. This feature is attributed to the charge transfer between TM atom and the adsorbed H atom, which significantly promotes the proton adsorption and the reduction of kinetics. In addition, a large number of electronic states near the Fermi level ensure efficient electron transfer. Our study may provide a new cost-effective, highly active and earth-abundant HER electrocatalyst for hydrogen production.",Chemical Engineering Science,10.1016/j.ces.2018.03.028
2D transition metal–TCNQ sheets as bifunctional single-atom catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER),"© 2019 Elsevier Inc.The identification of catalytically active and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) would revolutionize rechargeable metal-air batteries and regenerative fuel cell technologies. In this study, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systemically investigate 2D transition metal based tetracyanoquinodimethane (TM–TCNQ, TM = Cr-Cu, Ru-Ag, Pt, Ir) monolayers with single TM atoms catalysts (SACs) distributed periodically with high density. We calculate a lower limiting overpotential of ηlim = 0.33 V for Fe-TCNQ yielding a higher expected activity than that of Pt metal (0.48 V) for the ORR under acidic conditions. The catalytic performance of Fe-TCNQ for OER is, however, surpassed by Ni-TCNQs (ηlim = 0.46 V), which is identified as the highest among the candidates. By applying grafting axial ligands and external strain, the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates on TM reactive sites can be further optimized and enhances the activities of Mn-, Fe- and Ni-TCNQs for the ORR or the OER. Here, Fe-TCNQ-Cl (ηlim = 0.27/0.55 V), followed by Fe-TCNQ-CO (ηlim = 0.67/0.43 V), are predicted as novel, high-performance bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts with comparable limiting overpotentials to those of the best commercially used electrocatalysts, Pt (ORR: ηlim = 0.48 V) and RuO2 (OER: ηlim = 0.42 V). In addition, the recently synthesized Fe-TCNQ possess excellent conductivity with fast electron transfer during the catalytic reactions. These results show 2D TM-TCNQ monolayers are durable, low-cost, and efficient catalysts for the ORR and the OER in metal-air batteries and fuel cells.",Journal of Catalysis,10.1016/j.jcat.2018.12.012
Identification of single-atom active sites in carbon-based cobalt catalysts during electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited. Monitoring atomic and electronic structure changes on active sites under realistic working conditions is crucial for the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts. Identification of the active structure during the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is critical to industrial water–alkali electrolysers, remains elusive and is a field of intense research. Here, by virtue of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy on a uniform cobalt single-site catalyst, we report the atomic-level identification of the dynamic structure of catalytically active sites under alkaline HER. Our results reveal the formation of a high-valence HO–Co 1 –N 2 moiety by the binding between isolated Co 1 –N 4 sites with electrolyte hydroxide, and further unravel the preferred water adsorption reaction intermediate H 2 O–(HO–Co 1 –N 2 ). Theoretical simulations rationalize this structural evolution and demonstrate that the highly oxidized Co sites are responsible for the catalytic performance. These findings suggest the electrochemical susceptibility of active sites, providing a coordination-engineered strategy for the advance of single-site catalysis.",Nature Catalysis,10.1038/s41929-018-0203-5
Isolated Fe Single Atomic Sites Anchored on Highly Steady Hollow Graphene Nanospheres as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2018 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe rational design of economical and high-performance nanocatalysts to substitute Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is extremely desirable for the advancement of sustainable energy-conversion devices. Isolated single atom (ISA) catalysts have sparked tremendous interests in electrocatalysis due to their maximized atom utilization efficiency. Nevertheless, the fabrication of ISA catalysts remains a grand challenge. Here, a template-assisted approach is demonstrated to synthesize isolated Fe single atomic sites anchoring on graphene hollow nanospheres (denoted as Fe ISAs/GHSs) by using Fe phthalocyanine (FePc) as Fe precursor. The rigid planar macrocycle structure of FePc molecules and the steric-hindrance effect of graphene nanospheres are responsible for the dispersion of Fe–N x species at an atomic level. The combination of atomically dispersed Fe active sites and highly steady hollow substrate affords the Fe ISAs/GHSs outstanding ORR performance with enhanced activity, long-term stability, and better tolerance to methanol, SO2, and NO x in alkaline medium, outperforming the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work highlights the great promises of cost-effective Fe-based ISA catalysts in electrocatalysis and provides a versatile strategy for the synthesis of other single metal atom catalysts with superior performance for diverse applications.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.201801103

An acidic H 2 /O 2 single cell with Pt 1 /C as cathode delivers a maximum power density of 520 mW cm −2 at 80 °C, corresponding to a superhigh platinum utilization of 0.09 g Pt kW −1 . Further physical characterization and density functional theory computations reveal that single Pt atoms anchored stably by four carbon atoms in carbon divacancies (Pt-C 4 ) are the main active centers for the observed high ORR performance.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201812423

Nitrogen Fixation by Ru Single-Atom Electrocatalytic Reduction,"© 2018 Elsevier Inc.Nitrogen fixation under ambient conditions remains a significant challenge. Here, we report nitrogen fixation by Ru single-atom electrocatalytic reduction at room temperature and pressure. In contrast to Ru nanoparticles, single Ru sites supported on N-doped porous carbon greatly promoted electroreduction of aqueous N2 selectively to NH3, affording an NH3 formation rate of 3.665 mgNH3h−1mgRu−1 at −0.21 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Importantly, the addition of ZrO2 was found to significantly suppress the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. An NH3 faradic efficiency of about 21% was achieved at a low overpotential (0.17 V), surpassing many other reported catalysts. Experiments combined with density functional theory calculations showed that the Ru sites with oxygen vacancies were major active centers that permitted stabilization of *NNH, destabilization of *H, and enhanced N2 adsorption. We envision that optimization of ZrO2 loading could further facilitate electroreduction of N2 at both high NH3 synthesis rate and faradic efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.Electrochemical reduction of N2 to NH3 using renewable electricity is a simple and green NH3 production method. Most reported catalytic systems, however, suffer from slow reaction kinetics, low N2 adsorption, and reduction activity. Designing selective and energy-efficient electrocatalysts is highly desirable to enable both high faradic efficiency and NH3 yield rate. Isolating Ru single atoms in N-doped porous carbon significantly promotes N2-to-NH3 conversion, reaching an NH3 formation rate of more than 3.6 mgNH3h−1mgRu−1. The addition of ZrO2 can effectively suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, affording a large NH3 faradic efficiency of up to 21% at a low overpotential (0.17 V).

Single atom-supported MXene: How single-atomic-site catalysts tune the high activity and selectivity of electrochemical nitrogen fixation,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.A central topic for the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (ENRR) lies in the search for facile electrocatalysts under ambient conditions. Inspired by recent works on stabilizing single atoms with Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets, herein, we designed a series of single atoms supported on Ti2CO2 and Mo2CO2 MXene monolayers as efficient electrocatalysts for the ENRR by a well-defined first-principles calculation. Our calculation results revealed that single Ru or Mo atom anchored Mo2CO2 or Ti2CO2 possessed high ENRR activity, and the calculated limiting potentials of Ti2CO2 were more negative than those of Mo2CO2 due to the high conductivity of Mo2CO2. Moreover, N2 can be efficiently reduced to NH3 on Ti@Mo2CO2via different reaction mechanisms with a record limiting potential (-0.64 V). Furthermore, the activity and selectivity of the ENRR on Mo@Mo2CO2 were evaluated by comparing the Gibbs free energy of each dinitrogen and hydrogen as well as the first dinitrogen protonation and hydrogen adsorption. We found that N2 reduction proceeds via a distal or hybrid mechanism with an overpotential down to 0.16 or 0.19 V, indicating Mo@Mo2CO2 as a robust electrocatalyst for the ENRR. This work opens up an exciting new avenue for the rational design of high-efficiency MXene-based nanocomposites for artificial N2 fixation.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta09776g
Single nickel atom supported on hybridized graphene-boron nitride nanosheet as a highly active bi-functional electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.Developing efficient bi-functional catalysts for simultaneous hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) is a promising yet challenging goal. Using first-principles computations, we proposed a novel design of a nickel single atom catalyst (Ni-SAC) supported by a hybridized graphene-boron nitride monolayer (BCN), to work as a highly active bi-functional electrocatalyst for both HER and OER. B-vacancy defects on BCN can immobilize Ni-SACs with high diffusion barriers. Owing to the effective charge polarization and synergistic effects between graphene, the BN domain, and Ni atoms, this design exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity with very low overpotentials of 0.47/0.02 V for OER/HER. Our design not only provides great potential for achieving overall water splitting but also adds a new class of electrocatalysts for a wide range of clean energy technologies.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta10500j
Cu single atoms on Ti2CO2 as a highly efficient oxygen reduction catalyst in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Although carbon-based single-atom catalysts (SACs), especially Fe-N-C, have been demonstrated as highly promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, their application remains a great challenge in acidic proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Here, by performing high throughput first-principles calculations for 3d, 4d and 5d transition-metal single atoms immobilized on two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbide (Ti2CT and Ti3C2T) surfaces as active sites, we rationally design SACs towards a highly efficient ORR and further propose a composition descriptor to provide atomic-level insights into the structure-activity relationship. Significantly, the parameters involved in the present descriptor can be conveniently obtained from the periodic table of elements. More importantly, we found that the Ti2CO2-supported non-noble Cu SACs exhibit excellent ORR activity with much lower overpotential (0.25 V) than that of Pt/C (0.4 V), high selectivity for 4e oxygen reduction, excellent stability and acid-resistance and are quite promising ORR catalysts for PEMFCs.

Single iron atoms stabilized by microporous defects of biomass-derived carbon aerogels as high-performance cathode electrocatalysts for aluminum-air batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Atomically dispersed metal catalysts have demonstrated superb electrocatalytic activity because of optimal atom efficiency. However, a rational design of low-cost, high-performance single atom catalysts remains a great challenge due to the elusive chemical reactions of the formation of metal active sites. In this work, biomass hydrogel is prepared as a template for mass production of three-dimensional carbon aerogel-supported single metal atom catalysts. By tailoring the structure of the hydrogel templates, the obtained carbon aerogels exhibit an increase of microporous defects which capture and stabilize isolated metal atoms and minimize aggregation during pyrolysis. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements indicate that single metal centers of FeN4 are formed and embedded within the hierarchical porous carbon frameworks. The obtained composites exhibit outstanding catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction in alkaline media, with a high onset potential of +1.05 V and half-wave potential of +0.88 V, as well as excellent durability. Remarkably, when the carbon aerogels are used as the cathode catalyst in an aluminum-air battery, the battery achieves an ultrahigh open-circuit voltage of 1.81 V, large power density of 181.1 mW cm-2 and stable discharge voltage of 1.70 V at 20 mA cm-2, markedly better than those with commercial Pt/C as the cathode catalyst.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta05981d
Atomically dispersed Fe-N: X active sites within hierarchical mesoporous carbon as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.It is still a great challenge to develop highly efficient catalysts with earth abundant materials to replace the precious platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report a self-sacrificing template strategy to synthesize hierarchical mesoporous carbon materials with atomically dispersed Fe-Nx active sites. Derived from an Fe-polydopamine precursor obtained via in situ polymerization of dopamine and etching of a cobalt template using an FeCl3 solution, the resultant catalyst shows a high specific surface area (1229.3 m2 g-1), a hierarchical mesoporous structure, an improved hydrophilicity, and abundant atomically dispersed Fe-Nx active sites. As a result, the single atom catalyst exhibits a remarkable activity and durability in 0.1 M KOH with an onset and half-wave potential of 1.03 and 0.88 V, respectively, which surpass those of its commercial Pt/C counterpart. In acidic and neutral media, the catalyst also exhibits a comparable electrocatalytic activity to but much greater durability than commercial Pt/C.

Molecule-level graphdiyne coordinated transition metals as a new class of bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions,"© the Owner Societies 2019.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are highly desired for maximizing the efficiency of metal atoms and can entail high selectivity and activity. Bifunctional catalysts enable higher performance and lower cost than two single-function catalysts. Supported single-atom bifunctional catalysts are therefore of great economic interest and scientific importance. Density functional theory calculations are used to design SACs, isolated transition metal anchored on graphdiyne (TM@GDY), for oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions in alkaline media. A dual-volcano plot is constructed to thoroughly describe and predict the catalytic activity toward ORR and OER processes on TM@GDY materials. The results demonstrate that GDY could provide a unique platform for synthesizing uniform SACs with high catalytic activity toward ORR and OER. The theoretical evaluations show that Ni@GDY and Pt@GDY catalysts possess comparable electrocatalytic activity for ORR and OER in alkaline media. The study not only provides deep insights into the catalytic activity of TM@GDY, but also guides the design of GDY based SACs.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/c9cp04068d
Nanostructured Co-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage: Current status and perspectives,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are three typical reactions in energy conversion devices, such as water electrolyzers, metal-air batteries and fuel cells. However, the sluggish kinetics of the HER/OER/ORR and their dependency on noble-metal-based catalysts (e.g. Pt, Ir and Ru) hinder the large-scale commercial applications of these devices. Hence, the development of low-cost, efficient, stable and scalable electrocatalysts, especially bifunctional HER/OER or OER/ORR electrocatalysts that could simultaneously catalyze HER/OER or OER/ORR, is highly desired but full of great challenges. To date, non-noble cobalt (Co)-based materials, including cobalt oxide, cobalt phosphides, cobalt chalcogenides (sulfide and selenides), Co-included layered double hydroxides, Co-N-C, Co-based single atoms and their composites, have been widely investigated as bifunctional electrocatalysts owing to their innate electrochemical capabilities and structural adjustability by mixing, doping or combining with other materials, such as carbon materials. In this review, the fundamental mechanisms of the bifunctional electrocatalysis of ORR/OER and OER/HER are introduced and analyzed, and recent progress in the design, synthesis and emerging applications of Co-based materials as bifunctional electrocatalysts for ORR/OER or OER/HER in alkaline electrolytes are summarized and discussed. Finally, the strategies and perspectives for designing novel highly efficient bifunctional cobalt-based electrocatalysts are analyzed. This analysis is expected to highlight the challenges faced by bifunctional noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for the study and development of next-generation electrocatalysts for the HER/ORR/OER.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta04949e
"Systematic exploration of N, C configurational effects on the ORR performance of Fe-N doped graphene catalysts based on DFT calculations","© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Metal single-atom catalysts (MSATs), such as Fe-N coordination doped sp2-carbon matrices, have emerged as a promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst to replace their costly platinum (Pt) based counterparts in fuel cells. In this work, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to systematically discuss the electronic-structure and surface-stress effects of N, C configurations on Fe-N doped graphene in single and double vacancy. The formation energy (Ef) of Fe-N-gra dropped off with the increase of N atoms incorporated for both single and double vacancy groups. The theoretical overpotentials on Fe-N-C sites were calculated and revealed that moderate N-doping levels and doping configuration could enhance the ORR activity of Fe-N coordination structures in the double vacancy and that doping N atoms is not effective for ORR activity in single vacancy. By exploring the d-band centers, we found that ligand effects and surface tension effects contribute to the modification of the d-band centers of metal Fe atoms. An optimum Fe-N-C ORR catalyst should exhibit moderate surface stress properties and an ideal N, C ligand configuration. This study provides new insight into the effects of N atom doping in Fe-N-gra catalysts and could help guide the rational design of high-performance carbon-based ORR electrocatalysts.",RSC Advances,10.1039/c9ra02822f
Cage-confinement of gas-phase ferrocene in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks to synthesize high-loading and atomically dispersed Fe-N codoped carbon for efficient oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Fe-N codoped carbon (Fe-N/C) has emerged as one of the most promising non-precious electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the fabrication of Fe-N/C with high Fe and N loadings while maintaining atomic dispersion of the loaded Fe is still challenging. Herein, we present a cage-confinement synthesis strategy that utilizes zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) with an ordered microporous structure to uniformly adsorb gas-phase ferrocene (FeCp) molecules at mildly elevated temperatures followed by carbonization to fabricate Fe-N/C with a high content of atomically dispersed Fe and abundant N. The content of FeCp molecules adsorbed in the nanocavities of ZIF-8 could be precisely controlled by the adsorption temperature and time, and confining the adsorbed FeCp in the nanocavities of ZIF-8 could effectively prevent the Fe atoms from aggregating and/or forming Fe compounds during the carbonization process. The Fe-N/C fabricated under optimal conditions has a high iron loading of 5.86 wt% and abundant N content of 10.51 at%. The as-prepared Fe-N/C exhibits a remarkable ORR catalytic performance in 0.1 M KOH with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.85 V (vs. RHE) and excellent long-term durability (less than 10 mV change of E1/2 after 10 000 cycles of the CV test and 11% current density decay after a 40 000 s long-term ORR test). This work provides a simple and controllable synthesis strategy for fabricating high-content atomically dispersed Fe and N codoped carbon catalysts, which might also shed light on the design and synthesis of other single-atom metal doped carbon materials for energy storage and conversion applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta04954a
Maximizing the utility of single atom electrocatalysts on a 3D graphene nanomesh,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Single atom catalysis has recently become the most active frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, however, its performance is practically limited by the exposure of single atoms to reactants. Herein, we synthesized a vertically aligned N-doped graphene nanomesh array (VNGNMA) with a high density of in-plane surface holes and out-of-plane interconnected, vertically aligned structures to facilitate the diffusion of reactants and maximize the utility of single atoms in the liquid phase. Pd and Pt single atom catalysts supported on a 3D graphene nanomesh outperformed benchmark Pt/C and conventional single atom catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction due to rapid mass transport.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta00942f
Graphene-boron nitride hybrid-supported single Mo atom electrocatalysts for efficient nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The conversion of nitrogen into ammonia under ambient conditions is of great significance but remains a great challenge. Interfacing of graphene with hexagonal boron-nitride (h-BN) leads to the formation of a hybrid sheet, namely BCN, which can be used as a stable and conductive support for an efficient single atom catalyst (SAC). Using first principles calculations, we designed a single Mo atom anchored on a defective BCN monolayer (Mo@BCN) as a durable, highly stable, and efficient SAC for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Compared to the semiconducting Mo-anchored h-BN, Mo@BCN exhibited metallic property that favored charge transport to active sites to drive the NRR. Importantly, this hybrid catalyst promoted the dominant NRR while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Investigation of the detailed mechanisms, including distal, alternating, and enzymatic mechanisms, for the reduction of N2 to NH3 has revealed outstanding catalytic performance of Mo@BCN at the quite low overpotential of 0.42 V via the enzymatic pathway independent of carbon concentration; thus, this study would lead to a new strategy for the development of efficient and stable SACs using BN-based materials as the substrate.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta02947h
1D/2D nitrogen-doped carbon nanorod arrays/ultrathin carbon nanosheets: Outstanding catalysts for the highly efficient electroreduction of CO2 to CO,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value-added chemicals is a promising strategy for alleviating both the greenhouse effect and the energy crisis. However, conventional electrocatalysts generally suffer from low energy efficiency and poor product selectivity and durability. Herein, one/two-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon nanorod arrays/ultrathin carbon nanosheet catalysts (1D/2D NR/CS-X) with high specific surface area and N doping were designed and prepared by in situ polymerization of aniline in the presence of ultrathin carbon nanosheets originating from the thermal expansion of calcium gluconate and acid treatment, followed by pyrolysis. 1D/2D NR/CS-900 was capable of converting CO2 to CO with the Faraday efficiency of up to 94.2% at -0.45 V vs. RHE, retaining its activity for at least 30 h, and exhibited an onset overpotential as low as 97 mV, which surpassed all the reported doped carbon materials and was comparable to single-atom metal catalysts. The Tafel slope of 1D/2D NR/CS-900 was only 65 mV dec-1, which indicated a rapid pre-equilibrating one-electron transfer followed by a rate-determining reaction step. DFT calculations revealed that the pyridinic N and unique 1D/2D structure of NR/CS-X could significantly lower the free energy barriers of ∗COOH and ∗CO intermediate formation and boost CO desorption; this led to the highly efficient electroreduction of CO2 to CO.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta02353d
Carbon nanotube-linked hollow carbon nanospheres doped with iron and nitrogen as single-atom catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in acidic solutions,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Non-noble metal electrocatalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are highly required to substitute expensive Pt/C as the cathode of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, the relatively low ORR activity of Pt-free catalysts under acidic conditions is the major issue. Herein, we engineered a three-dimensional structure consisting of atomically dispersed Fe, N-doped hollow carbon nanospheres linked by carbon nanotubes as an electrocatalyst for the ORR. Benefiting from the unique structure and high-density atomic Fe-Nx sites, this new type of electrocatalyst showed an impressive ORR half-wave potential of 0.84 V and kinetic current density of 13.1 mA cm-2 at a potential of 0.8 V in acidic media, which was even better those of commercial Pt/C.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta00508k
Pt-embedded in monolayer g-C3N4 as a promising single-atom electrocatalyst for ammonia synthesis,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The development of advanced electrocatalysts for ambient NH3 production is increasingly attractive but severely plagued by low activity and poor selectivity. Herein, we reported first-principles results to explore the potential of transition metal (Sc-Cu, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Re, Ir and Pt) atoms embedded in monolayer g-C3N4 as efficient single-atom electrocatalysts for NH3 production. We found that embedding single Pt atoms in g-C3N4 enables robust stability and good electrical conductivity and particularly results in excellent activity (with a low limiting potential of-0.24 V) at room temperature. Furthermore, the dominant N2 adsorption over that of H atoms suggests superior NH3 selectivity. Mechanistic analyses disclosed that single Pt atoms and g-C3N4 work in concert to address the significant deviation from the nitrogen linear scaling relationships, synergistically providing highly active sites for ambient electrochemical NH3 synthesis.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta01624d
Transition metal-embedded two-dimensional C3N as a highly active electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Searching for highly efficient, stable and cost-effective catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is vital to resolve energy security and environmental problems. Herein, by means of computational screening based on the density functional theory (DFT), we studied a wide range of transition metal (TM) atoms embedded into the double carbon vacancy of C3N monolayers (VCC), denoted as TM-VCC (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir and Pt), as efficient single-atom catalysts (SACs) for OER and ORR. The calculated results showed that all the considered TM-VCC composites exhibited a metallic feature that ensured efficient charge transfer during reactions. The interaction strength between intermediates and TM-VCC has direct correlation with the d-band center of TM, which can be tuned by changing the TM atoms with different numbers of d electrons. The best catalyst for OER was Rh-VCC with an overpotential (ηOER) of 0.35 V, followed by Co-VCC (0.43 V). For the ORR process, Rh-VCC exhibited the lowest ORR overpotential (ηORR) of 0.27 V, followed by Co-VCC (0.42 V). The results suggested that the performances of the newly predicted Rh-VCC and Co-VCC SACs are comparable to those of the noble-metal benchmark catalysts for OER and ORR. Ab initio molecular dynamic simulations indicated that Rh-VCC and Co-VCC SACs could remain stable under 300 K and possessed high energy barriers to prevent the isolated Rh and Co atoms from clustering. Our results highlight a new family of efficient and stable catalysts with a single atom anchored on carbon nitride-based materials, which provides a useful guideline for catalyst design and practical applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta01389j
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 by two-dimensional transition metal porphyrin sheets,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Looking for highly stable and efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction is quite crucial, but a big challenge in community. In this paper, the catalytic performance of the first transition metal series-porphyrin (TM-PP) monolayers as single atom catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 has been studied using density functional theory. The results show that the TM-PP monolayers have excellent catalytic stability and CO2 electrochemical reduction selectivity. The primary reduction product of Sc-PP, Mn-PP and Ni-PP is CO, the primary reduction product of Ti-PP and V-PP is CH4, and the primary reduction product of the other five monolayers is HCOOH. Ti-PP, V-PP, Ni-PP, and Cu-PP have an overpotential >0.7 V, while the overpotentials of the other monolayers are all less than 0.5 V. In particular, the overpotentials for Mn-PP and Co-PP are very low (∼0.13 V). Therefore, TM-PP monolayers are promising systems for experimental research on electrochemical catalysts for CO2 reduction.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta01188a
Mo-doped boron nitride monolayer as a promising single-atom electrocatalyst for CO2 conversion,"© 2019 Cui et al.The design of new, efficient catalysts for the conversion of CO2 to useful fuels under mild conditions is urgent in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate the energy crisis. In this work, a series of transition metals (TMs), including Sc to Zn, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd and Ag, supported on a boron nitride (BN) monolayer with boron vacancies, were investigated as electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) using comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results demonstrate that a single-Mo-atom-doped boron nitride (Mo-doped BN) monolayer possesses excellent performance for converting CO2 to CH4 with a relatively low limiting potential of -0.45 V, which is lower than most catalysts for the selective production of CH4 as found in both theoretical and experimental studies. In addition, the formation of OCHO on the Mo-doped BN monolayer in the early hydrogenation steps is found to be spontaneous, which is distinct from the conventional catalysts. Mo, as a non-noble element, presents excellent catalytic performance with coordination to the BN monolayer, and is thus a promising transition metal for catalyzing CRR. This work not only provides insight into the mechanism of CRR on the single-atom catalyst (Mo-doped BN monolayer) at the atomic level, but also offers guidance in the search for appropriate earth-abundant TMs as electrochemical catalysts for the efficient conversion of CO2 to useful fuels under ambient conditions.",Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology,10.3762/BJNANO.10.55
Achieving highly efficient CO2 to CO electroreduction exceeding 300 mA cm-2 with single-atom nickel electrocatalysts,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value-added products is a promising approach to reduce excess CO2 in the atmosphere. However, the selective reduction of CO2 in aqueous electrolytes has been challenging owing to a competing hydrogen evolution reaction occurring in aqueous electrolytes. In this study, single atom nickel and nitrogen doped three-dimensional porous carbon catalysts are developed for the selective production of carbon monoxide (CO) from CO2. The catalysts exhibit high CO selectivity with over 99% faradaic efficiency at -0.8 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and achieve a high current density of over 50 mA cm-2 at -1.0 V vs. RHE in a bicarbonate electrolyte. To further improve the CO2 reduction rate, the accessibility of CO2 to the catalysts was enhanced by directly supplying gaseous CO2 to the surface of the catalysts. The catalysts were deposited between a gas diffusion layer and an ion exchange membrane to form a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Benefiting from the high concentration of CO2 over the catalyst surfaces and the three-dimensional structure of the catalysts, a high CO production rate exceeding 300 mA cm-2 with 99% faradaic efficiency can be achieved.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta02405k
gt-C 3 N 4 coordinated single atom as an efficient electrocatalyst for nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2019, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. The electrochemical reduction of nitrogen to ammonia is a promising way to produce ammonia at mild condition. The design and preparation of an efficient catalyst with high ammonia selectivity is critical for the real applications. In this work, a series of transition metal (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, and Cd) atoms supported by gt-C 3 N 4 (TM/gt-C 3 N 4 ) are investigated as electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) based on density functional calculations. It is found that Mo/gt-C 3 N 4 with a limiting potential of -0.82 V is the best catalyst for standing-on adsorbed N 2 cases. While for lying-on adsorbed N 2 cases, V/gt-C 3 N 4 with a limiting potential of -0.79 V is better than other materials. It is believed that this work provides several promising candidates for the non-noble metal electrocatalysts for NRR at mild condition.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano Research,10.1007/s12274-019-2378-8
Atomic iridium@cobalt nanosheets for dinuclear tandem water oxidation,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Atomization of noble metals enable their electrocatalysis applications with low cost, whereas the isolated mononuclear site after atomization might lead leads to limited performance. Herein, we present a general strategy of atomically confined alloying (ACA) to synthesize an electrocatalyst of single atom iridium-trapping cobalt nanosheets with dual-reactive Ir-Co sites. The atomic Ir@Co nanosheets (1.7 wt% Ir) exhibit excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a small overpotential (273 mV at 10 mA cm-2) and high stability, higher than that of the Ir/C catalyst (290 mV at 10 mA cm-2). More importantly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experiments demonstrated that water oxidation proceeded on atomic Ir@Co nanosheets via a dinuclear tandem mechanism, in which Ir-Co dual sites cooperatively worked in favour of the sequential transfer from Co-OH∗ to Ir-O∗ via a Co-O-Ir intermediate, and stabilization of OOH∗ species by hydrogen bonding interaction. The cooperative mechanism based on a dinuclear electrocatalyst by ACA is hoped to open up more possibilities of single atom noble metal electrocatalysts for various applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta01088b
A single-atom catalyst of cobalt supported on a defective two-dimensional boron nitride material as a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction: A DFT study,"© 2019 the Owner Societies.Single-atom catalysts present extraordinary catalytic performance towards various reactions. In this work, the possibility of single Co atoms supported by the experimentally available defective two-dimensional boron nitride material (2D-BN) with boron vacancies (Co/BN) as a potential catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was investigated by density functional theory. Co/BN has a similar active center to the cobalt nitride species, which have been proved to be effective ORR catalysts. It is found that Co atoms bind with the defective 2D-BN strongly to ensure the stability of Co/BN. Moreover, all of the ORR intermediates can be adsorbed on Co/BN. Especially, the HOOH species is found to be unstable and decomposes into two OH species immediately, suggesting that the ORR process occurs on Co/BN only through a direct 4e- pathway. Along the favorable pathway, the reduction of O2 to OOH is the rate-limiting step with a largest activation barrier of 0.30 eV and the maximum free energy change is 0.82 eV. Co/BN exhibits competitive ORR activity with that of CoN3 embedded graphene and Pt-based catalysts. These results should be enlightening to understand the ORR mechanism on Co/BN and design novel single-atom catalysts for the ORR and other electrocatalysis reactions.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/c9cp00452a
Ordered platinum-bismuth intermetallic clusters with Pt-skin for a highly efficient electrochemical ethanol oxidation reaction,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The ethanol oxidation reaction is extensively explored, but electrocatalysts that could achieve a complete oxidation pathway to CO2/CO32- are much less reported. Here, we synthesize a monatomic Pt layer (Pt-skin) on ordered intermetallic PtBi clusters (PtBi@Pt) supported on graphene via a single atom self-assembling (SAS) method to form a superior catalyst. The PtBi@Pt with an ultrafine size (∼2 nm) delivers an extremely high mass activity of 9.01 mA μgPt-1, which is 8-fold more active than the commercial Pt/C; significantly, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates that ethanol is completely oxidized to CO32- on the PtBi@Pt, accompanied by 12 electron transfer, as is further demonstrated by the density functional theory results.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c8ta09553a

The prevalent catalysts for natural and artificial N 2 fixation are transition-metal (TM) atoms. By using density functional theory computations, several TM atoms embedded on boron sheets as N 2 fixation electrocatalysts were investigated in this work. Our results revealed that single ruthenium (Ru) atom-doped boron sheets exhibited outstanding catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis at ambient conditions through the distal pathway with small activation barrier of 0.42 eV; this was less than half of that of the reported flat Ru (0001) catalysts (1.08 eV). These results highlight the value of boron as a substrate for the design of single-atom catalysts due to its unique electron-deficient features.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c8ta08219g
Sub-Nanometer-Sized Iridium Species Decorated on Mesoporous Co 3 O 4 for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Optimizing the surface structure at the atomic scale is crucial for developing effective catalysts. In this work, a hybrid material consisting of well-dispersed sub-nanometer-sized (SNS) iridium (Ir) species decorated on mesoporous Co 3 O 4 was fabricated as electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through pyrolysis of IrCl 3 /Co(NO 3 ) 2 complexes confined within the mesoporous KIT-6 template. It was found that the KIT-6 template played a critical role in the formation of SNS Ir species. The optimized Ir−Co 3 O 4 -1 showed highly efficient OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 1.527 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm −2 , and superior stability in alkaline condition. The electrochemical results demonstrated that moderate Ir incorporation was conductive to form the high valence Co ions in form of Co oxyhydroxide during the OER process. The present work would open a new route for material design of SNS Ir species decorated mesoporous metal oxides for the application in catalysis.",ChemElectroChem,10.1002/celc.201801645
Transition-metal single atoms in nitrogen-doped graphenes as efficient active centers for water splitting: A theoretical study,"© 2019 the Owner Societies.Highly active single-atom catalysts (SACs) have recently been intensively studied for their potential in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to the existence of many such SAC systems, a general understanding of the trend and designing principle is necessary to discover an optimal SAC system. In this work, by using density functional theory (DFT), we investigated a series of late single transition metals (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Pd) anchored on various N doped graphenes (xN-TM, x = 1-4) as electrocatalysts for both the HER and OER. Solvent effects were taken into account using an implicit continuum model. Our results reveal that the catalytic activity of SACs is determined by the local coordination number of N and TM in the catalysts. Among the considered catalysts, a low-coordinated Co site, i.e. a triple-coordinated Co, exhibits a high catalytic activity toward the HER with a calculated hydrogen adsorption free energy of -0.01 eV, whereas a high-coordinated Co center, i.e. a quadruple-coordinated Co is a promising candidate for the OER with a low computed overpotential of -0.39 V, which are comparable to those of noble metal catalysts, indicating superior HER and OER performance of N-Co co-doped graphenes. The results shed light on the potential applications of TM and N co-doped graphenes as efficient single-atom bifunctional catalysts for water splitting, thereby functioning as promising candidates for hydrogen/oxygen production.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/c8cp06755d
Single tungsten atom supported on N-doped graphyne as a high-performance electrocatalyst for nitrogen fixation under ambient conditions,"© 2018 the Owner Societies.Electrochemical reduction of dinitrogen molecules (N2) to value-added ammonia by using renewable electricity under mild conditions is regarded as a sustainable and promising strategy for N2 fixation. However, the lack of efficient, robust and inexpensive electrocatalysts for such electrochemical reduction has prevented its wide application. Herein, we report a novel single-atom catalyst, i.e., a single tungsten (W) atom anchored on N-doped graphyne (W@N-doped graphyne) as a highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalyst for the N2 reduction reaction. The inert NN triple bond can be sufficiently activated when an N2 molecule is adsorbed on the W atom. A single atom of W coordinated with one N atom (doping into an sp-hybridized carbon atom) exhibits the highest catalytic performance with ultra-low onset potential of 0.29 V for N2 reduction reactions. The 'distal mechanism' is identified as the most favourable catalytic pathway. Moreover, the improved electrical conductivity of W@N-doped graphyne compared to that of pristine graphyne can ensure better electron transfer efficiency during the reduction processes. Our study provides a novel electrocatalyst with excellent catalytic performance for electrochemical reduction of N2 to NH3 under ambient conditions.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/c8cp06978f
A single boron atom doped boron nitride edge as a metal-free catalyst for N2 fixation,"© 2018 the Owner Societies.N2 fixation is one of the most challenging tasks in chemistry. Recently, tremendous efforts have been devoted to transition metal-based materials. However, metal-free catalysts for N2 conversion have been rarely explored. Here, by using density functional theory, we predict, for the first time that a single B-atom decorated BN edge (B@BN) can act as a metal-free catalyst for the conversion of an N2 molecule to NH3 under ambient conditions. N2 fixation on the B@BN edge exhibits an extremely low overpotential of only 0.13 V through a distal mechanism. Moreover, fast removal of the produced NH3 molecule is observed with an uphill Gibbs free energy change of only 0.35 V, which is lower than those of ever-reported electrocatalysts such as Mo-doped BN and 2D Mxene. Our findings highlight a novel single atom metal-free catalyst for N2 fixation, providing a cost-efficient process for sustainable NH3 production.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/c8cp07064d
Cobalt single-atoms anchored on porphyrinic triazine-based frameworks as bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Designing and fabrication of highly active single-atom catalysts (SACs) with maximized atomic efficiency is highly desirable but still remains a great challenge. Herein, highly active and stable cobalt single-atoms with a Co-N 4 moiety were uniformly anchored on a porous porphyrinic triazine-based framework (CoSAs/PTF) by a simple ionothermal method. Due to the abundant single-atom Co-N 4 species, the hierarchical porous structure and the good conductivity, the resultant catalyst is highly active for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the ORR, a more positive half-wave potential of 0.808 V (vs. RHE) was achieved, compared with commercial benchmark Pt/C (0.806 V). Furthermore, a small onset potential of 21 mV and a low Tafel slope of 50 mV per decade were obtained for the HER. The porphyrin-like structure was found to stabilize the CoSAs effectively, thus leading to long-term durability and a remarkable methanol-tolerant behavior. This bifunctional single-atom catalyst might be a promising candidate to replace Pt-based electrocatalysts in electrolysers and fuel cells.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c8ta09490j
Atomic Co/Ni dual sites and Co/Ni alloy nanoparticles in N-doped porous Janus-like carbon frameworks for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Single-atom electrocatalysts have attracted board interest in the recent years as they combine the advantages of heterogeneous and homogeneous electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, single-atom electrocatalysts with single metal component cannot further satisfy the demand of catalytic properties. This work developed atomic Co/Ni dual sites in N-doped porous carbon Janus-like frameworks through epitaxial growth of cobalt based MOFs on nickel complexes. Structural characterization and atomic-scale transmission electron microscopy revealed the homogeneously dispersed active sites of Co-Ni alloy and single Co/Ni atoms. Electrochemical data strongly demonstrated the advantages of integrating Co-MOF and Ni complex with different topological structures to form a Janus-like structure. The resultant catalysts afforded onset potential of 0.93 V and half-wave potential of 0.84 V for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media, and 0.86 V and 0.73 V in acid media, which is better than single noble-metal-free catalysts, even close to commercial Pt/C. Besides, the catalysts also exhibited good oxygen evolution reaction performance (a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a potential of 1.59 V) and overvoltage between ORR and OER is 0.78 V. Density functional theory calculations indicated the high electrocatalytic activities are originated from the synergetic effect of atomic Co/Ni-N-C bonds and microstructure of the prepared materials. This work paves a new avenue for the development of multiatomic electrocatalysts for energy conversion.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.08.074
Theoretical Approaches to Describing the Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity of Single-Atom Catalysts,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Single-atom catalysts have recently emerged as promising low-cost alternatives to Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Given the unique properties that distinguish these systems from traditional transition-metal electrocatalysts, it is essential to benchmark and establish appropriate computational approaches to study these novel materials. Herein, we employ multiple levels of theory, including wave function methods, density functional theory (DFT), and classical simulations, to investigate Cu-modified covalent triazine framework catalysts (Cu/CTF). We consider three major aspects of treating this system computationally. First, we present a step-wise approach to predict the ORR mechanism and adsorbate coverages on Cu/CTF. We then benchmark various DFT methods to coupled-cluster theory with the domain-based local pair natural orbital approximation, which indicates that HSE06 and PBE0 hybrid functionals most accurately describe the adsorption energies of ORR adsorbates on Cu/CTF. We finally employ thermodynamic integration and other techniques to consider solvation effects, which play significant roles in predicting the energies of reaction intermediates and the overall ORR pathway. Our findings indicate that accurate descriptions of both the electronic structure and solvation are necessary to understand the ORR activity of Cu/CTF.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b09430
Tris(2-benzimidazolylmethyl)amine-Directed Synthesis of Single-Atom Nickel Catalysts for Electrochemical CO Production from CO2,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value-added products is a promising approach to reducing excess CO2 in the atmosphere. However, the development of electrocatalysts for highly selective and efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction has been challenging because protons are usually easier to reduce than CO2 in an aqueous electrolyte. Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been suggested as candidate CO2 reduction catalysts due to their unique catalytic properties. To prepare single-atom metal active sites, the stabilization of metal atoms over conductive supports such as graphene sheets to prevent metal aggregation is crucial. To address this issue, a facile method was developed to prepare single-atom nickel active sites on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets for the selective production of carbon monoxide (CO) from CO2. The tris(2-benzimidazolylmethyl)amine (NTB) ligand was introduced as a linker that can homogeneously disperse nickel atoms on the graphene oxide (GO) sheets. Because the NTB ligands form strong interactions with the GO sheets by π–π interactions and with nickel ions by ligation, they can effectively stabilize nickel ions on GO sheets by forming Ni(NTB)-GO complexes. High-temperature annealing of Ni(NTB)-GO under inert atmosphere produces nickel- and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide sheets (Ni-N-RGO) with single-atom Ni−N4 active sites. Ni-N-RGO shows high CO2 reduction selectivity in the reduction of CO2 to CO with 97 % faradaic efficiency at −0.8 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode).",Chemistry - A European Journal,10.1002/chem.201803615
Enhanced oxygen reduction with single-atomic-site iron catalysts for a zinc-air battery and hydrogen-air fuel cell,"© 2018, The Author(s).Efficient, durable and inexpensive electrocatalysts that accelerate sluggish oxygen reduction reaction kinetics and achieve high-performance are highly desirable. Here we develop a strategy to fabricate a catalyst comprised of single iron atomic sites supported on a nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur co-doped hollow carbon polyhedron from a metal-organic framework@polymer composite. The polymer-based coating facilitates the construction of a hollow structure via the Kirkendall effect and electronic modulation of an active metal center by long-range interaction with sulfur and phosphorus. Benefiting from structure functionalities and electronic control of a single-atom iron active center, the catalyst shows a remarkable performance with enhanced kinetics and activity for oxygen reduction in both alkaline and acid media. Moreover, the catalyst shows promise for substitution of expensive platinum to drive the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction in zinc-air batteries and hydrogen-air fuel cells.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-018-07850-2
Anchoring zero valence single atoms of nickel and iron on graphdiyne for hydrogen evolution,"© 2018 The Author(s).Electrocatalysis by atomic catalysts is a major focus of chemical and energy conversion effort. Although transition-metal-based bulk electrocatalysts for electrochemical application on energy conversion processes have been reported frequently, anchoring the stable transition-metal atoms (e.g. nickel and iron) still remains a practical challenge. Here we report a strategy for fabrication of ACs comprising only isolated nickel/iron atoms anchored on graphdiyne. Our findings identify the very narrow size distributions of both nickel (1.23 Å) and iron (1.02 Å), typical sizes of single-atom nickel and iron. The precision of this method motivates us to develop a general approach in the field of single-atom transition-metal catalysis. Such atomic catalysts have high catalytic activity and stability for hydrogen evolution reactions.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-018-03896-4
Design of Boron Doped C2N-C3N Coplanar Conjugated Heterostructure for Efficient HER Electrocatalysis,"© 2018 The Author(s).Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via the electrocatalytic reduction of water on metal-free catalysts may become a promising method for a sustainable energy supply in the future. However, compared with noble metals or transition metals, the carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts show poor activity. Here, a novel coplanar metal-free catalyst (C2N-C3N) was designed for the first time to achieve better efficiency for electron transfer and water reduction. Through the DFT calculations, we discovered that the unique coplanar C2N-C3N structure can promote the directional transfer of electrons from C3N to C2N under the drive of built-in electric potential in the π-conjugated plane. To achieve higher performance in HER, the single atom doping by the substitution of boron is carried out. Remarkably, after the boron is doped, the barrier in the Tafel step decreases from 2.35 eV to 0.86 eV. Our results indicate that the novel B-doped coplanar C2N-C3N structure is a promising metal-free catalyst for HER.",Scientific Reports,10.1038/s41598-018-24044-4
Tuning the Performance of Single-Atom Electrocatalysts: Support-Induced Structural Reconstruction,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Creating active and stable electrocatalysts remains a highly desirable and critical goal in the fields of catalysis and clean energy conversion. Single-atom catalyst (SAC), as a new research frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, has demonstrated emerging prospects for many electrocatalytic reactions. Support-assisted pyrolysis approaches are widely used in the synthesis of single-atom electrocatalysts. While extensive efforts have been devoted to increase the loading of the atomically dispersed metal sites, the role of the support in creating these active metal sites remains largely unexplored. Herein, we compare catalysts created by support-free and support-assisted pyrolysis of vitamin B12 and cobalt tetramethoxyphenylporphyrin, respectively, and demonstrate an important effect of support-induced structural reconstruction that directly controls the activation of SAC. Electrochemical studies show support-free catalysts are inactive for oxygen reduction reaction whereas the support-assisted pyrolysis yields highly active catalysts using the same molecular precursors. X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments reveal that both the metal-nitrogen coordination and the type of nitrogen species are different in these two types of samples, which leads to a difference in the d-band of the cobalt metal center and ultimately controls the catalytic activity and stability. This new insight provides a unique perspective on how to tune the electrocatalytic performances of SAC at the molecular level.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b02315
Efficient and Selective Electroreduction of CO2 by Single-Atom Catalyst Two-Dimensional TM-Pc Monolayers,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Electrochemical CO2 reduction to value-added fuels and chemicals provides a ""clean"" and efficient way to mitigate energy shortages and to lower the global carbon footprint if one could find highly stable, efficient, selective, and low-cost electrocatalysts. However, this remains a huge challenge. In this work, the catalytic performance of transition metal-phthalocyanine (TM-Pc) monolayers as single-atom catalysts for the electroreduction of CO2 was systematically investigated by spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results show that the bonding of single metal atoms with Pc can be large enough for the individual atoms to be uniformly dispersed and anchored in a modified 2D TM-Pc monolayer. Considering the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, TM-Pc has a good hydrogen evolution inhibition. The main CRR reduction products of Sc-Pc, Ti-Pc, V-Pc, and Fe-Pc monolayers are CH4. For Cr-Pc, Mn-Pc, and Zn-Pc monolayers, HCOOH is dominant, while for Co-Pc, HCHO is predicted. Except for the Sc-Pc, Ti-Pc, and V-Pc monolayers by (with too large overpotentials, exceeding 1 V), the reduction overpotential of other TM-Pc catalysts are in the range of 0.017-0.819 V, among them Mn-Pc has the lowest overpotential (0.017 V) and Fe-Pc has the highest overpotential (0.819 V). These were all lower than the overpotentials of well-studied copper which has the best catalytic performance. Therefore, our work may open up new avenues for the development of highly efficient catalytic materials for CO2 reduction.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b03945
Golden single-atomic-site platinum electrocatalysts,"© 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited. Bimetallic nanoparticles with tailored structures constitute a desirable model system for catalysts, as crucial factors such as geometric and electronic effects can be readily controlled by tailoring the structure and alloy bonding of the catalytic site. Here we report a facile colloidal method to prepare a series of platinum–gold (PtAu) nanoparticles with tailored surface structures and particle diameters on the order of 7 nm. Samples with low Pt content, particularly Pt 4 Au 96 , exhibited unprecedented electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of formic acid. A high forward current density of 3.77 A mg Pt −1 was observed for Pt 4 Au 96 , a value two orders of magnitude greater than those observed for core–shell structured Pt 78 Au 22 and a commercial Pt nanocatalyst. Extensive structural characterization and theoretical density functional theory simulations of the best-performing catalysts revealed densely packed single-atom Pt surface sites surrounded by Au atoms, which suggests that their superior catalytic activity and selectivity could be attributed to the unique structural and alloy-bonding properties of these single-atomic-site catalysts.",Nature Materials,10.1038/s41563-018-0167-5
Design of active nickel single-atom decorated MoS2 as a pH-universal catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2018MoS2 has been considered as a potential alternative to Pt-based catalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the presence of the inactive in-plane domains limits their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst. Here, we demonstrate a new approach for activating these inactive sites and therefore dramatically enhancing the activity. We discover that decorating single Ni atom on MoS2 can increase the HER activity in both alkaline and acidic conditions. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that single Ni atom modifiers are inclined to single dispersion in the S-edge sites and H-basal sites of MoS2, resulting in a favorable change in the adsorption behavior of H atoms on their neighboring S atoms and subsequently the HER activity. Consequently, the single-Ni-atom decorated MoS2 (NiSA-MoS2) achieved cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2 at overpotentials of 98 mV and 110 mV in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The dispersion of the Ni single atoms in the NiSA-MoS2 is unaffected upon 2000 cycles in both acidic and alkaline conditions. This single atom decorating approach presents a facile and promising pathway for designing active electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.09.003
Hierarchically Porous M–N–C (M = Co and Fe) Single-Atom Electrocatalysts with Robust MNx Active Moieties Enable Enhanced ORR Performance,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe great interest in fuel cells inspires a substantial amount of research on nonprecious metal catalysts as alternatives to Pt-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. In this work, bimodal template-based synthesis strategies are proposed for the scalable preparation of hierarchically porous M–N–C (M = Fe or Co) single-atom electrocatalysts featured with active and robust MN2 active moieties. Multiscale tuning of M–N–C catalysts regarding increasing the number of active sites and boosting the intrinsic activity of each active site is realized simultaneously at a single-atom scale. In addition to the antipoisoning power and high affinity for O2, the optimized Fe–N–C catalysts with FeN2 active site presents a superior electrocatalytic activity for ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.927 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) in an alkaline medium, which is 49 and 55 mV higher than those of the Co–N–C counterpart and commercial Pt/C, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the FeN2 site is more active than the CoN2 site for ORR due to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates and products involved. The present work may help rational design of more robust ORR electrocatalysts at the atomic level, realizing the significant advances in electrochemical conversion and storage devices.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201801956
Single Co Atoms Anchored in Porous N-Doped Carbon for Efficient Zinc-Air Battery Cathodes,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Exploration of cheap, efficient, and highly durable transition-metal-based electrocatalysts is critically important for the renewable energy chain, including both energy storage and energy conversion. Herein, we have developed cobalt (Co) single atoms anchored in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanoflake arrays, synthesized from Co-MOF precursor and followed by removal of the unwanted Co clusters. The well-dispersed Co single atoms are attached to the carbon network through N-Co bonding, where there is extra porosity and active surface area created by the removal of the Co metal clusters. Interestingly, compared with those electrocatalysts containing excess Co nanoparticles, a single Co atom alone demonstrates a lower oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential and much higher oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) saturation current, showing that the Co metal clusters are redundant in driving both OER and ORR. Given the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and mechanical flexibility, the electrocatalyst assembled on carbon cloth is employed as the air cathode in a solid-state Zn-air battery, which presents good cycling stabilities (2500 min, 125 cycles) as well as a high open circuit potential (1.411 V).",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.8b02556
Achieving a Record-High Yield Rate of 120.9 μgNH3 mgcat.−1h−1 for N2 Electrochemical Reduction over Ru Single-Atom Catalysts,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe electrochemical reduction of N2 into NH3 production under ambient conditions represents an attractive prospect for the fixation of N2. However, this process suffers from low yield rate of NH3 over reported electrocatalysts. In this work, a record-high activity for N2 electrochemical reduction over Ru single atoms distributed on nitrogen-doped carbon (Ru SAs/N-C) is reported. At −0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, Ru SAs/N-C achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 29.6% for NH3 production with partial current density of −0.13 mA cm−2. Notably, the yield rate of Ru SAs/N-C reaches 120.9μgNH3 mgcat -1h-1, which is one order of magnitude higher than the highest value ever reported. This work not only develops a superior electrocatalyst for NH3 production, but also provides a guideline for the rational design of highly active and robust single-atom catalysts.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.201803498
Co nanoparticle embedded in atomically-dispersed Co-N-C nanofibers for oxygen reduction with high activity and remarkable durability,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdAlthough Co and N codoped carbon (Co-N-C) materials could be served as the promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts, they still suffer from unsatisfactory catalytic activity, especially in acidic environment. Herein, we report that the construction of Co nanoparticles embedded within highly porous, atomically-dispersed Co-N-C nanofibers catalyst not only significantly improves the ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.778 V/RHE, but also achieves the remarkable durability with only ~ 9 mV decay of E1/2 after a 10000-cycle accelerated durability test between 0.6 and 1.1 V. Both aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy confirm the existence of Co single atoms in the carbon nanofibers. Density functional theoretical calculation reveals that the introduction of Co core nanoparticle lowers the d band center of surface Co atoms in graphite shells and makes the free energy diagrams of the ORR process on Co-N-C shell more close to the ideal case, thus boosting the catalytic performance. Proton exchange membrane fuel cell integrated with as-prepared catalyst delivers a peak power density of 0.42 W cm−2 together with excellent stability after 100 h operation. This study provides an ideal perspective to develop highly efficient and durable Co-based catalyst for the oxygen reduction.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.08.005
"Well-elaborated, mechanochemically synthesized Fe-TPP⊂ZIF precursors (Fe-TPP = tetraphenylporphine iron) to atomically dispersed iron–nitrogen species for oxygen reduction reaction and Zn-air batteries","© 2018 Elsevier LtdAlthough atomically dispersed Fe-N species as electrocatalysts often exhibit high activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the rational design and facile fabrication of single-atom Fe-N species-based catalysts remains a great challenge because of their easy aggregation. Herein, a new precursor of host-guest Fe-TPP⊂rho-ZIF (Fe-TPP = tetraphenylporphyrin iron; rho-ZIF = zeolitic imidazolate framework with the rho topology) for the first time was elaborately designed and readily prepared by one-pot mechanochemical method, and then was pyrolyzed into Fe-N/C catalysts with no need of solution-based steps and post-ammonia/acid treatments, which greatly simplified the preparation procedures. Owing to the host-guest confinement at the molecular level, the encapsulated Fe centers within interior cavities of rho-ZIF host matrice can be effectively isolated during pyrolysis to afford atomically dispersed Fe-N4 moieties anchored on the carbon matrice. Such a well-elaborated precursor not only endows the final product with the single-atom characteristic, but also with high Fe loading (up to 3.8 wt%) and specific surface area. Benefitting from the outstanding compositional and structural advantages, the resultant Fe-N/C exhibits highly efficient ORR activity with E1/2 of 0.895 V in 0.1 M KOH, ~ 50 mV more positive than that of the commercial Pt/C, which is among the top-level ORR electrocatalysts to date. It has excellent stability and displays a negligible change after a 10000-cycle accelerated durability test. Moreover, rechargeable Zn-air batteries were also assembled to demonstrate the practical application of the as-obtained Fe-N/C as air cathode catalyst. Our work may provide an insight into the facile and large-scale production of high-performance and durable non-precious metal catalysts with atomic-level dispersion.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.07.033
General Dimension-Controlled Synthesis of Hollow Carbon Embedded with Metal Singe Atoms or Core–Shell Nanoparticles for Energy Storage Applications,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimMetal–organic framework (MOF) derived carbonaceous nanocomposites have recently received enormous interest due to their intriguing physiochemical properties and diverse energy applications. However, there is a lack of general synthetic approaches that can achieve flexible dimension control while manipulating metal dispersion of MOF derived carbon composites. Herein, the authors present an attractive route for the growth of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) with different dimensions and types of metal nodes that can be further transformed into either core–shell nanoparticles or metal single atoms. The formation of a ZIF-8 seed layer on ZnO template is identified as the key step, enabling uniform growth of various ZIF materials (e.g., Zn/Co-ZIF, Zn/Fe-ZIF, and ZIF-7) with different dimensions (1D, 2D, and 3D). Simultaneously, this approach avoids free growth of 0D MOF particles and diminishing of the ZnO template. To demonstrate the importance of dimensional control over the growth of ZIF materials for energy application, the 1D and 2D ZnO@ZIF precursors are converted into carbon nanotube and carbon nanoplate, which are decorated with Co/CoS2 nanoparticles and Fe single atoms, respectively. Two high dimensional carbon nanocomposites deliver significantly enhanced performances compared to their 0D counterparts when employed as the Li-ion battery anode and bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201801101
Fe/N Codoped Carbon Nanocages with Single-Atom Feature as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalyst,"Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.The electrochemical kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) determines the energy conversion efficiency of fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Thus, developing efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for the ORR has attracted mounting attention. Herein, a facile synthetic route is presented to achieve atomic dispersion of Fe-Nx species in N doped porous carbon nanocages, resulting in a single-atom ORR electrocatalyst. The obtained Fe/N codoped carbon nanocages exhibit a comparable half-wave potential (0.82 V) and higher limiting current density compared to the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst. In addition, by using it as air electrode electrocatalyst, the assembled Zn-air battery device shows a specific capacity of 705 mAh g-1 at 5 mA cm-2 and a negligible voltage loss after continuous operation for 67 h. The superior performance of Fe/N codoped carbon nanocages is attributed to the porous structure and the synergetic effect of atomically dispersed Fe-Nx species and N doping.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.8b00970
Tuning nitrogen reduction reaction activity via controllable Fe magnetic moment: A computational study of single Fe atom supported on defective graphene,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe design and development of low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction is crucial for NH3 synthesis. Herein, by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations and thermodynamic analysis, the catalytic mechanisms of N2 to NH3 conversion on single Fe atom embedded in single vacancy and N-doped graphene are systematically investigated. Significantly, the magnetic moment of Fe atom varies with the coordination of neighboring N atom. An approximately linear scaling is found between the adsorption energy of N atom (ΔEN*) and Fe magnetic moment. The increased magnetic moment of Fe atom can strengthen the ΔEN*, and promote the charge transfer between the N2 molecule and substrates, resulting in a substantially lower overpotential for N2 electroreduction. Our results highlight an important role of Fe magnetism in N2 activation, which offers a novel strategy for inspiring the rational design of highly efficient carbon-based materials for N2 fixation and conversion.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.07.168
Photochemical Solid-Phase Synthesis of Platinum Single Atoms on Nitrogen-Doped Carbon with High Loading as Bifunctional Catalysts for Hydrogen Evolution and Oxygen Reduction Reactions,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Currently, Pt single atoms as promising electrocatalysts have been applied to electrocatalysis aiming to significantly improve performance and remarkably lower usage of the noble metal. Herein, we propose a photochemical solid-phase reduction method to fabricate well-defined isolated Pt atoms on a nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Pt1/NPC). Using this simple and fast synthesis strategy, the formed Pt atoms are well-dispersed on the carbon without clusters or nanoparticles. The loading of the Pt is up to 3.8 wt % relative to the carbon. The Pt1/NPC catalyst displays an ultrahigh electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 25 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and mass activity of 2.86 A mg-1 Pt (24-times higher than a commercial Pt/C). Moreover, the catalyst also presents efficient catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction. Its mass activity is 4.3-times that obtained by a commercial Pt (20 wt %). The improved electrocatalytic activities of the Pt1/NPC catalyst are ascribed to the favorable chemical and electronic structure of the Pt-N4 coordination raised by strong electron transfer from the isolated Pt atoms to the coordinated N atoms in this catalyst. The Pt1/NPC can be employed as a bifunctional catalyst for fuel cells and hydrogen production.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.8b02288
C2N-graphene supported single-atom catalysts for CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction: mechanistic insight and catalyst screening,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as an excellent platform for enhancing catalytic performance. Inspired by the recent experimental synthesis of nitrogenated holey 2D graphene (C2N-h2D) (Mahmood et al., Nat. Commun., 2015, 6, 6486-6493), we report density functional theory calculations combined with computational hydrogen electrode model to show that C2N-h2D supported metal single atoms (M@C2N) are promising electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2 RR). M confined at pyridinic N6 cavity promotes activation of inert O═C═O bonds and subsequent protonation steps, with *COOH → *CO → CHO predicted to be the primary pathway for producing methanol and methane. It is found that *CO + H+ + e- → *CHO is most likely to be the potential determining step; breaking the scaling relation of *CO and *CHO binding on M@C2N SACs may simply be a rare event that is sensitively controlled by the detailed geometry of the adsorbate. Among twelve metals screened, M@C2N SACs where M = Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ru were identified to be effective in catalyzing CO2 RR with lowered overpotentials (0.58 V-0.80 V).",Nanoscale,10.1039/c8nr04961k
Atomically Dispersed Fe-Nx/C Electrocatalyst Boosts Oxygen Catalysis via a New Metal-Organic Polymer Supramolecule Strategy,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe development of high-performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts derived from non-Pt group metals (non-PGMs) is urgent for the wide applications of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, a facile and cost-efficient supramolecular route is developed for making non-PGM ORR catalyst with atomically dispersed Fe-Nx/C sites through pyrolyzing the metal-organic polymer coordinative hydrogel formed between Fe3+ and α-L-guluronate blocks of sodium alginate (SA). High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) verify that Fe atoms achieve atomic-level dispersion on the obtained SA-Fe-N nanosheets and a possible fourfold coordination with N atoms. The best-performing SA-Fe-N catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.812 and 0.910 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 0.1 m KOH, respectively, along with respectable durability. Such performance surpasses that of most reported non-PGM ORR catalysts. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the relieved passivation effect of OH* on Fe-N4/C structure leads to its superior ORR activity to Pt/C in alkaline solution. The work demonstrates a novel strategy for developing high-performance non-PGM ORR electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed and stable M-Nx coordination sites in both acidic and alkaline media.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201801226
Significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity of Au25 clusters by single platinum atom doping,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe search for highly active catalysts with low-Pt content to advance the commercialization of fuel cells is continuing to receive ample attention. Herein, we report that by doping a single Pt atom into Au25 to form Pt1Au24 nanoclusters, the electrocatalytic activity for the direct formic acid oxidation (FAO) to carbon dioxide is enhanced significantly. The mass activity of Pt1Au24 (3.7 A mgPt+Au − 1) is nearly 12 and 34 times greater than that of Pt nanoclusters and the commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and potential-dependent thermodynamic analyses provide fundamental insights into the reaction mechanism illustrating that FAO proceeds through the carboxyl (COOH) intermediate on Pt1Au24. The present study not only develops a novel class of single-Pt atom doped Au nanocluster electrocatalysts for fuel cells with high utilization of Pt, but also provides insight into the mechanism of FAO on Pt-doped Au nanoclusters. Moreover, this study begins to shed light on the structure-activity relationship and helps to provide a strategy to design new catalysts by tuning their catalytic properties at the atomic level.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.05.052
Single-atom cobalt electrocatalysts for foldable solid-state Zn-air battery,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdTo achieve wearable application, developing highly active and low cost non-precious metal bifunctional oxygen catalysts for foldable solid-state Zn-air battery is still a great challenge. Herein, we report a single-atom cobalt electrocatalyst with CoN4 moieties dispersed on nitrogen-doped graphitic nanosheet (marked as CoN4/NG) by a surfactant-assisted approach. The CoN4/NG catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities with a half-wave potential of 0.87 V (versus RHE) for ORR and a low overpotential of 0.38 V at 10 mA cm−2 for OER. Moreover, the liquid Zn-air battery with the CoN4/NG catalyst as the air electrode displays a superior discharging and charging performance, larger power density, higher energy density and robust stability (without any decay after 100 h cycle test), compared to the 20% Pt/C + IrO2 counterpart. Importantly, the CoN4/NG-based flexible solid-state Zn-air battery also exhibits a high power density and a long-term stability of 30 cycles under flat and folded states, which means that the single-atom cobalt catalyst may be a promising candidate for practical applications in wearable flexible solid batteries.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.06.023

However, the synthesis of NH3 at ambient conditions remains a coveted goal for chemists. In this work, we study the potential of the newly synthesized single-atom catalysts, i.e., single metal atoms (Cu, Pd, Pt, and Mo) supported on N-doped carbon for N2 reduction reaction (NRR) by employing first-principles calculations. It is found that Mo1-N1C2 can catalyze NRR through the enzymatic mechanism with an ultralow overpotential of 0.24 V. Most importantly, the removal of the produced NH3 is rapid with a free-energy uphill of only 0.47 eV for the Mo1-N1C2 catalyst, which is much lower than that for ever-reported catalysts with low overpotentials and endows Mo1-N1C2 with excellent durability. The coordination effect on activity is further evaluated, showing that the experimentally realized active site, single Mo atom coordinated by one N atom and two C atoms (Mo-N1C2), possesses the highest catalytic performance.

The electrocatalyst remarkably exhibits a highly positive onset potential of 0.99 V and half-wave potential of 0.86 V, both even more positive than the commercial Pt/C catalyst, and the current density is also greater than that of the Pt/C catalyst in alkaline media. A decent performance is observed in acidic media also. The electrocatalyst is extraordinarily stable to harsh environments. A promising performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is demonstrated by the electrocatalyst, while for bifunctional electrocatalysis a small overvoltage of 0.78 V is observed with onset potential at the lower overpotential of 300 mV announcing the advantage of its usage for practical energy conversion and storage systems.

Abundant dangling unsaturated P vacancies play a role in stabilization. Ruthenium single atoms (SAs) are successfully anchored by strong coordination interactions between the d orbitals of Ru and the lone pair electrons of N located in the HPN matrix. The atomic dispersion of Ru atoms can be distinguished by X-ray absorption fine structure measurements and spherical aberration correction electron microscopy. Importantly, Ru SAs@PN is an excellent electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 m H2SO4, delivering a low overpotential of 24 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 38 mV dec−1. The catalyst exhibits robust stability in a constant current test at a large current density of 162 mA cm−2 for more than 24 hours, and is operative for 5000 cycles in a cyclic voltammetry test. Additionally, Ru SAs@PN presents a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.67 H2 s−1 at 25 mV, and 4.29 H2 s−1 at 50 mV, in 0.5 m H2SO4 solution, outperforming most of the reported hydrogen evolution catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrate that the Gibbs free energy of adsorbed H* over the Ru SAs on PN is much closer to zero compared with the Ru/C and Ru SAs supported on carbon and C3N4, thus considerably facilitating the overall HER performance.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201804854
"O-, N-Atoms-Coordinated Mn Cofactors within a Graphene Framework as Bioinspired Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysts","© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimManganese (Mn) is generally regarded as not being sufficiently active for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to other transition metals such as Fe and Co. However, in biology, manganese-containing enzymes can catalyze oxygen-evolving reactions efficiently with a relative low onset potential. Here, atomically dispersed O and N atoms coordinated Mn active sites are incorporated within graphene frameworks to emulate both the structure and function of Mn cofactors in heme–copper oxidases superfamily. Unlike previous single-metal catalysts with general M-N-C structures, here, it is proved that a coordinated O atom can also play a significant role in tuning the intrinsic catalytic activities of transition metals. The biomimetic electrocatalyst exhibits superior performance for the ORR and zinc–air batteries under alkaline conditions, which is even better than that of commercial Pt/C. The excellent performance can be ascribed to the abundant atomically dispersed Mn cofactors in the graphene frameworks, confirmed by various characterization methods. Theoretical calculations reveal that the intrinsic catalytic activity of metal Mn can be significantly improved via changing local geometry of nearest coordinated O and N atoms. Especially, graphene frameworks containing the Mn-N3O1 cofactor demonstrate the fastest ORR kinetics due to the tuning of the d electronic states to a reasonable state.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.201801732
Definitive Structural Identification toward Molecule-Type Sites within 1D and 2D Carbon-Based Catalysts,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimDeveloping facile preparation routes and atomic-level characterization methods for single-atom catalysts is highly desirable but still challenging. Herein, a general strategy is proposed to construct transition metal single atoms within 1D and 2D carbon supports. The carbon supports, typically graphene and carbon nanotubes, are coated with various transition metal-containing bimetal hydroxides, followed by polydopamine coating and high-temperature pyrolysis. X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy measurements and simulations efficiently indicate that single atoms (Co, Fe, or Cu) are captured within the applied carbon supports, distinctively forming exclusive molecule-type sites. As a proof-of-concept application, the obtained catalysts exhibit remarkable performance for electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction, even surpassing commercial Pt/C catalyst. The developed versatile route opens up new avenues for the design of carbon-based catalysts with definite molecular active sites. The atomic-level structural identifications provide significant guidance for mechanistic studies toward single-atom catalysts.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201800436
Bifunctional Nitrogen and Cobalt Codoped Hollow Carbon for Electrochemical Syngas Production,"© 2018 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimElectrochemical conversion of CO2 and H2O into syngas is an attractive route to utilize green electricity. A competitive system economy demands development of cost-effective electrocatalyst with dual active sites for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a single atom electrocatalyst derived from a metal–organic framework is proposed, in which Co single atoms and N functional groups function as atomic CO2RR and HER active sites, respectively. The synthesis method is based on pyrolysis of ZnO@ZIF (zeolitic imidazolate framework). The excess in situ Zn evaporation effectively prevents Co single atoms (≈3.4 wt%) from aggregation and maintains appropriate Co/N ratio. The as-prepared electrocatalyst is featured with high graphitic degree of carbon support for rapid electron transport and sponge-like thin carbon shells with hierarchical pore system for facilitating active site exposure and mass transport. Therefore, the electrocatalyst exhibits a nearly 100% Faradic efficiency and a high formation rate of ≈425 mmol g−1 h−1 at 1.0 V with the gaseous product ratio (CO/H2) approximating ideal 1/2. With the assistance of an extensive material characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is identified that Co single atoms are uniformly coordinated in the form of Co–C2N2 moieties, and act as the major catalytic sites for CO2 reduction.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.201800177
Graphene supported atomic Co/nanocrystalline Co3O4 for oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdElectrochemical water splitting by a robust electrocatalyst plays a key role in hydrogen production for clean and sustainable energy. In this work, a kind of nanohybrid of graphene supported atomic Co and nanocrystalline Co3O4 was synthesized through electrochemical synthesis of atomic cobalt onto graphene using 1-Butyl-3-methylimidzolium tetrachlorocobalt [(BMIm)2CoCl4] as an electrolyte. By virtue of the synergistic effect of single-cobalt atoms and Co3O4 nanoparticles, the nanohybrid presents enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction. The low onset potential is 0.49 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and the overpotential of the current density of 10 mA cm−2 is 0.30 V in aqueous solution, which is comparable to commercial RuO2. Moreover, the nanohybrid exhibits remarkably long stability for over 45 h at a fixed potential of 0.6 V.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.04.177
Cutting the Gordian Knot of electrodeposition via controlled cathodic corrosion enabling the production of supported metal nanoparticles below 5 nm,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.In the past decades, there has been an ongoing search for tailor-made active metal nanoparticles for the use as electrocatalysts. An upcoming versatile and green method for the synthesis of nanoparticles is electrodeposition. However, the state-of-the-art electrodeposited metal particle sizes are in the range of 50–200 nm. Production of high surface area metallic electrocatalysts with small particle sizes is a serious limitation of electrodeposition, i.e., the Gordian Knot. In this article, we present a novel and facile approach by combining electrodeposition with controlled cathodic corrosion to obtain tailor-made nanoparticles down to the single atom. Via controlled cathodic corrosion treatment, relatively big electrodeposited metal nanoparticles (Ag, Pt, Pd, Ni, etc.) are effectively broken down and evenly dispersed on the carbon electrode surface, without particle detachment. The same electrochemical phenomenon is also utilized for in-situ electrocatalysts reactivation, referred as redispersion, of the degraded electrocatalysts. The two new concepts open new possibilities and applications for the electrodeposition as a metal nanoparticles production method and in-situ regeneration solutions for electrochemical energy conversion reactors like fuel cells and electrolyzers; as the two pillars of a near-future transition to sustainable energy.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.12.080
Highly Efficient Ammonia Synthesis Electrocatalyst: Single Ru Atom on Naturally Nanoporous Carbon Materials,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimStabilizing single-atom metal catalysts with carbon materials and utilizing their synergistic effect remains challenging due to weak interactions between carbon-based supports and metals. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that a single Ru atom was supported on a wide range of natural nanoporous carbon materials, including C2N, triazine-C3N4 (T-C3N4), and γ-graphene. These carbon materials belong to a new generation of highly efficient electrocatalysts for the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) and are named Ru1@C2N, Ru1@T-C3N4, and Ru1@γ-graphyne, respectively. Ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations show that a single Ru atom can be stably anchored in the nanopores of these carbon materials with strong cohesive energy. Compared with parallel adsorption configuration, the vertical adsorption configuration of N2 exhibits higher adsorption energy. The calculated Gibbs free energy reveals N2 reduction on the three catalysts via associative mechanisms. Despite the similar limiting potentials (−0.96, −0.94, and −0.98 V on Ru1@C2N, Ru1@T-C3N4, and Ru1@γ-graphynes, respectively), the limiting step differs, indicating the significant effects of carbon material substrates on electrochemical NRR. However, the competitive and efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) changes the potential determining step and increases the overpotential for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction (NRR). This study provides insights for experimental synthesis of electrocatalysts for N2 reduction.",Advanced Theory and Simulations,10.1002/adts.201800018
A universal principle for a rational design of single-atom electrocatalysts,"© 2018 The Author(s) 2018, under exclusive licence to Macmillan Publishers Ltd, part of Springer Nature.Developing highly active single-atom catalysts for electrochemical reactions is a key to future renewable energy technology. Here we present a universal design principle to evaluate the activity of graphene-based single-atom catalysts towards the oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. Our results indicate that the catalytic activity of single-atom catalysts is highly correlated with the local environment of the metal centre, namely its coordination number and electronegativity and the electronegativity of the nearest neighbour atoms, validated by available experimental data. More importantly, we reveal that this design principle can be extended to metal-macrocycle complexes. The principle not only offers a strategy to design highly active nonprecious metal single-atom catalysts with specific active centres, for example, Fe-pyridine/pyrrole-N4 for the oxygen reduction reaction; Co-pyrrole-N4 for the oxygen evolution reaction; and Mn-pyrrole-N4 for the hydrogen evolution reaction to replace precious Pt/Ir/Ru-based catalysts, but also suggests that macrocyclic metal complexes could be used as an alternative to graphene-based single-atom catalysts.",Nature Catalysis,10.1038/s41929-018-0063-z
Co-synthesis of atomic Fe and few-layer graphene towards superior ORR electrocatalyst,"© 2017Large-scale synthesis of either single-metal atom catalyst or graphene from graphite direct exfoliation at high yield is quite challenging. Here we demonstrated a scalable electrochemical approach to synthesize few-layer graphene flakes and isolated Fe atoms at the same time. It was found that graphite could be expanded in FeCl4--based ionic liquid at a low potential of 2 V. Fe isolated onto graphene resulted from electrochemical reactions of FeCl4--based intercalates. After annealing at the presence of nitrogen source, atomic Fe isolation was kept and coordinated with nitrogen. The paintable atomic layer material exhibited superior oxygen reduction reaction performance to Pt/C. The catalytic activity could be enhanced 30 times per gram and 100 times per metal atom, if Fe-Nx/graphene was compared with Pt/C (20 wt.% Pt) on the basis of metal content.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2017.11.004
Atomically Dispersed Iron-Nitrogen Active Sites within Porphyrinic Triazine-Based Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Both Alkaline and Acidic Media,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.The rational design of highly efficient, low-cost, and durable electrocatalysts to replace platinum-based electrodes for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is highly desirable. Although atomically dispersed supported metal catalysts often exhibit excellent catalytic performance with maximized atom efficiency, the fabrication of single-atom catalysts remains a great challenge because of their easy aggregation. Herein, a simple ionothermal method was developed to fabricate atomically dispersed Fe-Nx species on porous porphyrinic triazine-based frameworks (FeSAs/PTF) with high Fe loading up to 8.3 wt %, resulting in highly reactive and stable single-atom ORR catalysts for the first time. Owing to the high density of single-atom Fe-N4 active sites, highly hierarchical porosity, and good conductivity, the as-prepared catalyst FeSAs/PTF-600 exhibited highly efficient activity, methanol tolerance, and superstability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under both alkaline and acidic conditions. This work will bring new inspiration to the design of highly efficient noble-metal-free catalysts at the atomic scale for energy conversion.",ACS Energy Letters,10.1021/acsenergylett.8b00245
ZIF-8 with Ferrocene Encapsulated: A Promising Precursor to Single-Atom Fe Embedded Nitrogen-Doped Carbon as Highly Efficient Catalyst for Oxygen Electroreduction,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays an important role in the fields of energy storage and conversion technologies, including metal–air batteries and fuel cells. The development of nonprecious metal electrocatalysts with both high ORR activity and durability to replace the currently used costly Pt-based catalyst is critical and still a major challenge. Herein, a facile and scalable method is reported to prepare ZIF-8 with single ferrocene molecules trapped within its cavities (Fc@ZIF-8), which is utilized as precursor to porous single-atom Fe embedded nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe–N–C) during high temperature pyrolysis. The catalyst shows a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.904 V, 67 mV higher than commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.837 V), which is among the best compared with reported results for ORR. Significant electrochemical properties are attributed to the special configuration of Fc@ZIF-8 transforming into a highly dispersed iron–nitrogen coordination moieties embedded carbon matrix.",Small,10.1002/smll.201704282

In the present study, we attempted to demonstrate that catalytic systems based on the principle of local cell reactions can be successfully fabricated using metal-doped covalent triazine frameworks as catalytic units. A conductive substrate carrying platinum- and copper-doped covalent triazine frameworks as catalysts for the oxidation and reduction processes, respectively, was developed to fabricate a local cell catalytic unit for the concurrent reduction of nitrate to nitrous oxide and oxidation of hydrogen.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.7b04465
Identification of binuclear Co2N5 active sites for oxygen reduction reaction with more than one magnitude higher activity than single atom CoN4 site,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdHerein, a novel binuclear active site structure, Co2NxCy, is intentionally designed and successfully fabricated to efficiently catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is achieved by precisely controlling the atomic scale structure of bimetal-organic frameworks before pyrolysis. Through discovering a two-atom site with Co-Co distance at 2.1–2.2 Å from aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), as well as a novel shortened Co-Co path (2.12 Å) from the X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we for the first time identified the binuclear Co2NX site in the pyrolyzed catalyst. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the structure is further confirmed as Co2N5. Excitingly, the Co2N5 site performs approximately 12 times higher activity than the conventional CoN4 site and the corresponding catalyst shows unprecedented catalytic activity in acidic electrolyte with half-wave potential of 0.79 V, approaching the commercial Pt/C catalyst and presenting the best one among the Co-N-C catalysts. Theoretical density functional theory calculations reveal that the novel binuclear site exhibits considerably reduced thermodynamic barrier towards ORR, thus contributing to the much higher intrinsic activity. Our finding opens up a new path to design efficient M-Nx/C catalysts, thus pushing the fuel cell industry field one step ahead.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.02.025
Confined organometallic Au1Nx single-site as an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe development of organometallic complexes with abundant stable single-atom active sites is highly desirable for cost-effective and commercial electrocatalysis towards renewable energy conversion and storage. Here, we report an atomic-level design and construction of a new type of organometallic Au1Nx single-site confined on organic carbon-nitride support as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient and durable oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution reaction (OER) performance. The combination of atomic characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the atomically dispersed Au1+ atoms are grafted onto carbon-nitride support by covalent Au–N bonds via an amine-induced-reduction strategy, forming atomic Au1Nx single-sites with potential oxygen-related catalytic activity. Hence, this developed Au1Nx single-site electrocatalyst could exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability with extraordinarily large mass activities of ~9000 A•gAu−1 for ORR at the half-wave potential 0.76 V, and of ~1500 A•gAu−1 for OER at overpotential 0.45 V, 20–26 times higher than those of benchmarking Pt/C and RuO2 electrocatalysts.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.01.044
Design of Single-Atom Co-N5 Catalytic Site: A Robust Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction with Nearly 100% CO Selectivity and Remarkable Stability,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.We develop an N-coordination strategy to design a robust CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) electrocatalyst with atomically dispersed Co-N5 site anchored on polymer-derived hollow N-doped porous carbon spheres. Our catalyst exhibits high selectivity for CO2RR with CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) above 90% over a wide potential range from -0.57 to -0.88 V (the FECO exceeded 99% at -0.73 and -0.79 V). The CO current density and FECO remained nearly unchanged after electrolyzing 10 h, revealing remarkable stability. Experiments and density functional theory calculations demonstrate single-atom Co-N5 site is the dominating active center simultaneously for CO2 activation, the rapid formation of key intermediate COOH∗ as well as the desorption of CO.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.8b00814
Porous Carbon-Hosted Atomically Dispersed Iron–Nitrogen Moiety as Enhanced Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction in a Wide Range of pH,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAs one of the alternatives to replace precious metal catalysts, transition-metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) electrocatalysts have attracted great research interest due to their low cost and good catalytic activities. Despite nanostructured M–N–C catalysts can achieve good electrochemical performances, they are vulnerable to aggregation and insufficient catalytic sites upon continuous catalytic reaction. In this work, metal–organic frameworks derived porous single-atom electrocatalysts (SAEs) were successfully prepared by simple pyrolysis procedure without any further posttreatment. Combining the X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements, the SAEs have been identified with superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability compared with Pt/C catalysts in alkaline condition. More impressively, the SAEs also show excellent ORR electrocatalytic performance in both acid and neutral media. This study of nonprecious catalysts provides new insights on nanoengineering catalytically active sites and porous structures for nonprecious metal ORR catalysis in a wide range of pH.",Small,10.1002/smll.201703118
Single-Atom Au/NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide Electrocatalyst: Probing the Origin of Activity for Oxygen Evolution Reaction,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.A fundamental understanding of the origin of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of transition-metal-based electrocatalysts, especially for single precious metal atoms supported on layered double hydroxides (LDHs), is highly required for the design of efficient electrocatalysts toward further energy conversion technologies. Here, we aim toward single-atom Au supported on NiFe LDH (sAu/NiFe LDH) to clarify the activity origin of LDHs system and a 6-fold OER activity enhancement by 0.4 wt % sAu decoration. Combining with theoretical calculations, the active behavior of NiFe LDH results from the in situ generated NiFe oxyhydroxide from LDH during the OER process. With the presence of sAu, sAu/NiFe LDH possesses an overpotential of 0.21 V in contrast to the calculated result (0.18 V). We ascribe the excellent OER activity of sAu/NiFe LDH to the charge redistribution of active Fe as well as its surrounding atoms causing by the neighboring sAu on NiFe oxyhydroxide stabilized by interfacial CO32- and H2O interfacing with LDH.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.8b00752
Examining the rudimentary steps of the oxygen reduction reaction on single-atomic Pt using Ti-based non-oxide supports,"© 2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering ChemistryIn the attempt to reduce the high-cost and improve the overall durability of Pt-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), density-functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to study the energetics of the elementary steps that occur during ORR on TiN(100)- and TiC(100)-supported single Pt atoms. The O2 and OOH* dissociation processes on Pt/TiN(100) are determined to be non-activated (i.e. “barrier-less” dissociation) while an activation energy barrier of 0.19 and 0.51 eV is found for these dissociation processes on Pt/TiC(100), respectively. Moreover, the series pathway (which is characterized by the stable OOH* molecular intermediate) on Pt/TiC(100) is predicted to be more favorable than the direct pathway. Our electronic structure analysis supports a strong synergistic co-operative effect by these non-oxide supports (TiN and TiC) on the reduced state of the single-atom Pt catalyst, and directly influences the rudimentary ORR steps on these single-atom platinized supports.",Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry,10.1016/j.jiec.2017.09.027
Single-Atom to Single-Atom Grafting of Pt1 onto FeN4 Center: Pt1@FeNC Multifunctional Electrocatalyst with Significantly Enhanced Properties,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimNonprecious metal catalysts (NPMCs) FeNC are promising alternatives to noble metal Pt as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts for proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells. Herein, a new modulation strategy is reported to the active moiety FeN4 via a precise “single-atom to single-atom” grafting of a Pt atom onto the Fe center through a bridging oxygen molecule, creating a new active moiety of Pt1O2Fe1N4. The modulated FeNC exhibits remarkably improved ORR stabilities in acidic media. Moreover, it shows unexpectedly high catalytic activities toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with overpotentials of 310 mV for OER in alkaline solution and 60 mV for HER in acidic media at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, outperforming the benchmark RuO2 and comparable with Pt/C(20%), respectively. The enhanced multifunctional electrocatalytic properties are associated with the newly constructed active moiety Pt1O2Fe1N4, which protects Fe sites from harmful species. Density functional theory calculations reveal the synergy in the new active moiety, which promotes the proton adsorption and reduction kinetics. In addition, the grafted Pt1O2 dangling bonds may boost the OER activity.

Highly Durable Platinum Single-Atom Alloy Catalyst for Electrochemical Reactions,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSingle atomic Pt catalyst can offer efficient utilization of the expensive platinum and provide unique selectivity because it lacks ensemble sites. However, designing such a catalyst with high Pt loading and good durability is very challenging. Here, single atomic Pt catalyst supported on antimony-doped tin oxide (Pt1/ATO) is synthesized by conventional incipient wetness impregnation, with up to 8 wt% Pt. The single atomic Pt structure is confirmed by high-angle annular dark field scanning tunneling electron microscopy images and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis results. Density functional theory calculations show that replacing Sb sites with Pt atoms in the bulk phase or at the surface of SbSn or ATO is energetically favorable. The Pt1/ATO shows superior activity and durability for formic acid oxidation reaction, compared to a commercial Pt/C catalyst. The single atomic Pt structure is retained even after a harsh durability test, which is performed by repeating cyclic voltammetry in the range of 0.05–1.4 V for 1800 cycles. A full cell is fabricated for direct formic acid fuel cell using the Pt1/ATO as an anode catalyst, and an order of magnitude higher cell power is obtained compared to the Pt/C.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201701476
Palladium single atoms supported by interwoven carbon nanotube and manganese oxide nanowire networks for enhanced electrocatalysis,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Advancement of electrocatalysts relies on the construction of both a highly efficient catalytic center and a highly conductive network support. Herein, we prepared a 3D interwoven structure with Pd atoms deposited on homogeneously bound MnO2 nanowires and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (Pd/MnO2-CNT), allowing the combination of superior catalytic performance of atomic Pd incorporated in the metal oxide and the high conductivity of CNT. Using this nanocomposite, stable bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) was achieved. Pd/MnO2-CNT displayed a large Pd mass activity for ORR, which is two magnitudes higher than that of Pd/CNT and 5-fold higher than that of the state-of-the-art Pd-based electrocatalysts operated in alkaline medium. Application of this composite catalyst in Zn-air batteries generates significantly high efficiency and cycling stability. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that MnO2 provided stronger electronic metal-support interaction than CNT. Pd single atoms doped in MnO2 work synergistically with the surrounding metal sites to activate molecular oxygen, and display optimized binding strength to reaction intermediates. Our strategy can be generalized to design new single atom electrocatalysts for numerous functionalities.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/C8TA09034C
Unravelling the electrochemical mechanisms for nitrogen fixation on single transition metal atoms embedded in defective graphitic carbon nitride,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Electrochemical reduction of nitrogen (N2), in which the conversion of N2 to ammonia (NH3) takes place under mild conditions, is of timely significance for paving a way toward technological applications in agriculture and the chemical industry. In this work, various single transition metal atoms anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with nitrogen vacancies (TM@NVs-g-C3N4), acting as electrocatalysts for N2 reduction, were systematically investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Most of the isolated metal atoms (Ti, V, Co, Ni, Zr, Mo, Ru and Pt) can be fixed by the nitrogen vacancies stably after performing the molecular dynamics simulation. For hexagonal close-packed and body centered cubic metal atoms, their N2 chemisorption activity decreases as the coordination number of the single atom rises. Nevertheless, the anchored cubic close-packed metal atom does not serve as a good site for N2 adsorption and activation even with a low-coordination number. Among all studied TM single atoms, the single Ti atom is found to be the most promising catalyst for its excellent N2 reduction performance with a potential-limiting step of 0.51 eV and a rate-determining barrier of 0.57 eV. Atomic level insights are provided to elucidate the electrochemical mechanisms for N2 reduction. The coordination number of the active center is accountable for the robust N2 reduction activity with high stability. Overall, this work exemplifies the in-depth investigations of different single TM atoms, including the coordination number and binding mode, which are essential to lay the groundwork for the advancement of single atom catalysis toward practical implementation.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/C8TA06497K
Accelerated active phase transformation of NiO powered by Pt single atoms for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Phase transformation of electrode materials widely occurs in electrocatalytic reactions. Metal oxides are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); their phase transformation is a key step for the multi-electron OER, and requires extra overpotential. However, little attention has been paid to accelerating and enhancing the phase transformation. Here, we report for the first time that single-atom Pt incorporated into the bulk crystalline phase of porous NiO nanocubes (0.5 wt% Pt/NiO) can greatly promote the active phase (NiOOH) evolution. The Pt doping was achieved by a scalable nanocasting approach using SiO2 as the hard template. In comparison with Pt/NiO samples with PtO2 nanoparticles segregated at the NiO surface (1 wt% Pt), as well as atomistic Pt atoms solely bound at the surface by atomic layer deposition, the bulk Pt doping shows the strongest power in facilitating active phase transformation, which leads to improved OER activity with reduced overpotential and Tafel slope. Experiential data revealed that the charge-transfer from Pt to Ni through O leads to a local weaker Ni-O bond. First principles calculations confirmed that rather than acting as an active site for the OER, monatomic Pt effectively increases the phase transformation rate by reducing the migration barrier of nearby Ni atoms. Our discoveries reveal the relationships of the heteroatom doped structure and phase transformation behavior during the electrochemical process and offer a new route for designing high-performance electrocatalysts.",Chemical Science,10.1039/c8sc02015a
Designing highly efficient dual-metal single-atom electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction inspired by biological enzyme systems,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Biological heme-copper oxidases (HCOs) play a critical role in the four-electron, four-proton reduction of O2 to H2O in biosystems. HCOs exhibit high enzymatic activity due to their natural structure with heme-non-heme metal active sites, and the non-heme metal plays a role in conferring and fine-tuning the O2 reduction activity of the HCOs. Inspired by this binuclear active enzyme, herein, we designed an efficient electrocatalyst (Fe, Mn-N/C) for the oxygen reduction reaction, which contains two types of metal-Nx active site incorporated within the graphene framework of porous carbon. The catalyst displayed remarkable ORR performance with a half-potential of 0.904 V and kinetic current density of 33.33 mA cm-2, which is 4.9 times that of 20% Pt/C (6.76 mA cm-2). When the Fe, Mn-N/C catalyst was applied as an air electrode in a Zn-air battery, it exhibited a superior performance compared to commercial Pt/C. Its discharge curve showed that the change in output voltage was negligible at 20 mA cm-2 for 23000 seconds (6.4 h). First principles calculations revealed that Fe, Mn-N/C needs less energy for the protonation of O∗ to OH∗ in ORR procedures compared with Fe-N/C. This catalyst, with its bimetal reactive center mimicking a metal enzyme, will pave a new way to design efficient electrocatalysts for the ORR in fuel cells.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c8ta04564j
Single transition metal atom embedded into a MoS2 nanosheet as a promising catalyst for electrochemical ammonia synthesis,"© 2018 the Owner Societies.The electrochemical reduction of N2 to NH3 (NRR) under ambient conditions is significant for sustainable agriculture. Here, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, the potential of a series of single transition metal (TM) atoms embedded into a MoS2 monolayer with an S-vacancy (TM/MoS2) as electrocatalysts for NRR was systematically investigated. Our DFT results revealed that among all these considered candidate catalysts, the single Mo atom embedded into the MoS2 nanosheet was found to be the most active catalyst for NRR with an onset potential of -0.53 V, in which the hydrogenation of the adsorbed N2∗ to N2H∗ is the potential-determining step. The high stabilization of the N2H∗ species is responsible for the superior performance of the embedded Mo atom for the NRR, which is well consistent with its d-band center. Our findings may facilitate the further design of single-atom electrocatalysts with high efficiency for NH3 synthesis at room temperature.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/c7cp08626a

We present a novel strategy to realize the traction and stabilization of isolated Pt atoms in the nitrogen-containing porous carbon matrix (Pt@PCM). In comparison with the commercial Pt/C catalyst (20 weight %), the as-prepared Pt@PCM catalyst exhibits significantly boosted mass activity (up to 25 times) for hydrogen evolution reaction. Results of extended x-ray absorption fine structure investigation and density functional theory calculation suggest that the active sites are associated with the lattice-confined Pt centers and the activated carbon (C)/nitrogen (N) atoms at the adjacency of the isolated Pt centers. This strategy May provide insights into constructing highly efficient single-atom catalysts for different energy-related applications.",Science Advances,10.1126/sciadv.aao6657
Theoretical Investigations of the Electrochemical Reduction of CO on Single Metal Atoms Embedded in Graphene,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Single transition metal atoms embedded at single vacancies of graphene provide a unique paradigm for catalytic reactions. We present a density functional theory study of such systems for the electrochemical reduction of CO. Theoretical investigations of CO electrochemical reduction are particularly challenging in that electrochemical activation energies are a necessary descriptor of activity. We determined the electrochemical barriers for key proton-electron transfer steps using a state-of-the-art, fully explicit solvent model of the electrochemical interface. The accuracy of GGA-level functionals in describing these systems was also benchmarked against hybrid methods. We find the first proton transfer to form CHO from CO to be a critical step in C1 product formation. On these single atom sites, the corresponding barrier scales more favorably with the CO binding energy than for 211 and 111 transition metal surfaces, in the direction of improved activity. Intermediates and transition states for the hydrogen evolution reaction were found to be less stable than those on transition metals, suggesting a higher selectivity for CO reduction. We present a rate volcano for the production of methane from CO. We identify promising candidates with high activity, stability, and selectivity for the reduction of CO. This work highlights the potential of these systems as improved electrocatalysts over pure transition metals for CO reduction.",ACS Central Science,10.1021/acscentsci.7b00442
Transition-Metal Single Atoms in a Graphene Shell as Active Centers for Highly Efficient Artificial Photosynthesis,"© 2017 Elsevier Inc.Utilizing solar energy to fix CO2 with water into chemical fuels and oxygen, a mimic process of photosynthesis in nature, is becoming increasingly important but still challenged by low selectivity and activity, especially in CO2 electrocatalytic reduction. Here, we report transition-metal atoms coordinated in a graphene shell as active centers for aqueous CO2 reduction to CO with high faradic efficiencies over 90% under significant currents up to ∼60 mA/mg. We employed three-dimensional atom probe tomography to directly identify the single Ni atomic sites in graphene vacancies. Theoretical simulations suggest that compared with metallic Ni, the Ni atomic sites present different electronic structures that facilitate CO2-to-CO conversion and suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction dramatically. Coupled with Li+-tuned Co3O4 oxygen evolution catalyst and powered by a triple-junction solar cell, our artificial photosynthesis system achieves a peak solar-to-CO efficiency of 12.7% by using earth-abundant transition-metal electrocatalysts in a pH-equal system. Using clean electricity to reduce CO2 to chemicals or fuels is becoming increasingly important to renewable energy applications and environmental protection. The challenge comes from the strong competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction in aqueous solutions, especially for those earth-abundant transition metals such as Ni, which dramatically lowers the CO2 reduction selectivity. Isolating the transition-metal single atoms into a graphene matrix can significantly tune their catalytic behaviors to favor the CO2-to-CO reduction pathway, reaching a high CO selectivity of more than 90%. This work creates an important platform in designing active and low-cost CO2 reduction catalysts with high selectivity toward fuels, opening up great opportunities for both technological applications in renewable energies and fundamental mechanism studies in catalysis. State-of-the-art three-dimensional atom probe tomography provides direct evidence of Ni single atoms coordinated in graphene vacancies for highly selective CO2 reduction to CO and suppressed hydrogen evolution in water.",Chem,10.1016/j.chempr.2017.09.014
Rational Design of Single Molybdenum Atoms Anchored on N-Doped Carbon for Effective Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe highly efficient electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) provides a promising pathway to resolve energy and environment problems. An electrocatalyst was designed with single Mo atoms (Mo-SAs) supported on N-doped carbon having outstanding HER performance. The structure of the catalyst was probed by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, indicating the formation of Mo-SAs anchored with one nitrogen atom and two carbon atoms (Mo1N1C2). Importantly, the Mo1N1C2 catalyst displayed much more excellent activity compared with Mo2C and MoN, and better stability than commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that the unique structure of Mo1N1C2 moiety played a crucial effect to improve the HER performance. This work opens up new opportunities for the preparation and application of highly active and stable Mo-based HER catalysts.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201710599
Platinum Terpyridine Metallopolymer Electrode as Cost-Effective Replacement for Bulk Platinum Catalysts in Oxygen Reduction Reaction and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Conducting polymers consisting of metal-selective coordination units and a highly conductive backbone, so-called metallopolymers, are interesting materials exposing single atoms for photo/electrocatalysis and thus represent a potential low-cost alternative for bulk or nanoparticulate platinum group metals (PGMs). We synthesized and fully characterized an electropolymerisable monomer bearing a pendant terpyridine unit for the selective complexation of PGMs. Electrocatalytic tests of the resulting metallopolymer, poly-[(tThTerpy)PtCl]Cl, revealed activity both in the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. Rotating disk experiments showed the direct four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water at low angular velocities of the rotating electrode. Furthermore, the fabrication of Pt metallopolymers proved to be simple, nonhazardous and versatile. This proof-of-concept opens up the possibility for developing future low-cost electro- and photocatalysts to replace current systems.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b02198
Creating coordinatively unsaturated metal sites in metal-organic-frameworks as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction: Insights into the active centers,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdMetal-organic-frameworks (MOFs), in which metal ions are single-atomically dispersed, are regarded as one of the most promising single-atom doped catalysts. Co-based species have been considered as a potential candidate to replace the precious RuO2 to electrocatalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67 (ZIF-67), a Co-containing MOF, may be an excellent precursor for single-atom OER electrocatalysts due to its rich and uniform distribution of cobalt species. In principle, Co ions are fully coordinated (except for those on the surfaces) in ZIF-67 without accessible sites for electrocatalysis. One way to utilize this single-atom material as electrocatalysts is to remove some of the ligands attached to Co atoms to create coordinately unsaturated metal sites (CUMSs) as the catalytic centers for OER. Herein, we, for the first time, have created CUMSs in ZIF-67 through dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma etching. The CUMSs act as excellent catalytic centers for OER with a promising electrocatalytic activity, even comparable to the precious RuO2. Interestingly, the OER activity of the CUMSs is reversible by supplementing the missing ligands. Our density-functional theory calculations also demonstrated the contribution of the unsaturated metal sites to the high catalytic activity for OER.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.09.055
Molecularly dispersed nickel-containing species on the carbon nitride network as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdHybrid materials containing single atoms or molecule-based active species immobilized on nanomaterials have been suggested as new, efficient catalytic systems for various reactions. In this study, novel hybrid materials consisting of molecularly dispersed Ni-based species on a graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) framework are prepared, and their excellent electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is discussed. Extensive chemical and structural characterizations confirm that the Ni-based species are attached and well-dispersed on the C3N4 network without agglomeration. In addition, results obtained from electrochemical characterization suggest that Ni-containing molecular entities dispersed on the C3N4 network are active species for the OER.",Carbon,10.1016/j.carbon.2017.08.039
Single cobalt atom and N codoped carbon nanofibers as highly durable electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Transition-metal and nitrogen-codoped carbon-based (TM-N/C) catalysts are promising candidates for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, TM-N/C catalysts suffer from insufficient ORR activity, unclear active site structure, and poor durability, particularly in acidic solution. Herein, we report single Co atom and N codoped carbon nanofibers (Co-N/CNFs) catalyst with high durability and desirable ORR activity in both acidic and alkaline solutions. The half-wave potential of the ORR shows a negligible decrease after a 10 000-cycle accelerated durability test. The high ORR durability is originated from the structural stability of the atomically dispersed Co-based active site, as revealed by probing analysis and density functional theory calculations. A passive direct methanol fuel cell with the Co-N/CNFs cathode delivers a maximal power density of 16 mW cm-2 and a remarkable stability during a 200 h test, demonstrating the application potential of Co-N/CNFs. The breakthrough of the highly durable TM-N/C ORR catalyst could open an avenue for affordable and durable fuel cells.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.7b02326
Atomic-Scale CoOx Species in Metal–Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Evolution Reaction,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe activity of electrocatalysts strongly depends on the number of active sites, which can be increased by downsizing electrocatalysts. Single-atom catalysts have attracted special attention due to atomic-scale active sites. However, it is a huge challenge to obtain atomic-scale CoOx catalysts. The Co-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) own atomically dispersed Co ions, which motivates to design a possible pathway to partially on-site transform these Co ions to active atomic-scale CoOx species, while reserving the highly porous features of MOFs. In this work, for the first time, the targeted on-site formation of atomic-scale CoOx species is realized in ZIF-67 by O2 plasma. The abundant pores in ZIF-67 provide channels for O2 plasma to activate the Co ions in MOFs to on-site produce atomic-scale CoOx species, which act as the active sites to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction with an even better activity than RuO2.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.201702546
Single Mo Atom Supported on Defective Boron Nitride Monolayer as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Nitrogen Fixation: A Computational Study,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The production of ammonia (NH3) from molecular dinitrogen (N2) under mild conditions is one of the most attractive and challenging processes in chemistry. Here by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we systematically investigated the potential of single transition metal atoms (Sc to Zn, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ag) supported on the experimentally available defective boron nitride (TM-BN) monolayer with a boron monovacancy as a N2 fixation electrocatalyst. Our computations revealed that the single Mo atom supported by a defective BN nanosheet exhibits the highest catalytic activity for N2 fixation at room temperature through an enzymatic mechanism with a quite low overpotential of 0.19 V. The high spin-polarization, selective stabilization of N2H∗ species, or destabilizing NH2∗ species are responsible for the high activity of the Mo-embedded BN nanosheet for N2 fixation. This finding opens a new avenue of NH3 production by single-atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.7b05213
Single-Atomic Ruthenium Catalytic Sites on Nitrogen-Doped Graphene for Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Acidic Medium,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential in the electrochemical energy conversion of fuel cells. Here, through the NH3 atmosphere annealing of a graphene oxide (GO) precursor containing trace amounts of Ru, we have synthesized atomically dispersed Ru on nitrogen-doped graphene that performs as an electrocatalyst for the ORR in acidic medium. The Ru/nitrogen-doped GO catalyst exhibits excellent four-electron ORR activity, offering onset and half-wave potentials of 0.89 and 0.75 V, respectively, vs a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 M HClO4, together with better durability and tolerance toward methanol and carbon monoxide poisoning than seen in commercial Pt/C catalysts. X-ray adsorption fine structure analysis and aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy are performed and indicate that the chemical structure of Ru is predominantly composed of isolated Ru atoms coordinated with nitrogen atoms on the graphene substrate. Furthermore, a density function theory study of the ORR mechanism suggests that a Ru-oxo-N4 structure appears to be responsible for the ORR catalytic activity in the acidic medium. These findings provide a route for the design of efficient ORR single-atom catalysts.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.7b02148
High performance platinum single atom electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction,"© The Author(s) 2017.For the large-scale sustainable implementation of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells in vehicles, high-performance electrocatalysts with low platinum consumption are desirable for use as cathode material during the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells. Here we report a carbon black-supported cost-effective, efficient and durable platinum single-atom electrocatalyst with carbon monoxide/methanol tolerance for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction. The acidic single-cell with such a catalyst as cathode delivers high performance, with power density up to 680 mW cm-2 at 80°C with a low platinum loading of 0.09 mgPt cm-2, corresponding to a platinum utilization of 0.13 gPt kW-1 in the fuel cell. Good fuel cell durability is also observed. Theoretical calculations reveal that the main effective sites on such platinum single-atom electrocatalysts are single-pyridinic-nitrogen-atom-anchored single-platinum-atom centres, which are tolerant to carbon monoxide/methanol, but highly active for the oxygen reduction reaction.",Nature Communications,10.1038/ncomms15938
Biomass Derived N-Doped Porous Carbon Supported Single Fe Atoms as Superior Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimExploring sustainable and high-performance electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the crucial issue for the large-scale application of fuel cell technology. A new strategy is demonstrated to utilize the biomass resource for the synthesis of N-doped hierarchically porous carbon supported single-atomic Fe (SA-Fe/NHPC) electrocatalyst toward the ORR. Based on the confinement effect of porous carbon and high-coordination natural iron source, SA-Fe/NHPC, derived from the hemin-adsorbed bio-porphyra-carbon by rapid heat-treatment up to 800 °C, presents the atomic dispersion of Fe atoms in the N-doped porous carbon. Compared with the molecular hemin and nanoparticle Fe samples, the as-prepared SA-Fe/NHPC exhibits a superior catalytic activity (E1/2 = 0.87 V and Jk = 4.1 mA cm−2, at 0.88 V), remarkable catalytic stability (≈1 mV negative shift of E1/2, after 3000 potential cycles), and outstanding methanol-tolerance, even much better than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. The sustainable and effective strategy for utilizing biomass to achieve high-performance single-atom catalysts can also provide an opportunity for other catalytic applications in the atomic scale.",Small,10.1002/smll.201604290
Isolated Single Iron Atoms Anchored on N-Doped Porous Carbon as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe development of low-cost, efficient, and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is desirable but remains a great challenge. Herein, we made a highly reactive and stable isolated single-atom Fe/N-doped porous carbon (ISA Fe/CN) catalyst with Fe loading up to 2.16 wt %. The catalyst showed excellent ORR performance with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.900 V, which outperformed commercial Pt/C and most non-precious-metal catalysts reported to date. Besides exceptionally high kinetic current density (Jk) of 37.83 mV cm−2 at 0.85 V, it also had a good methanol tolerance and outstanding stability. Experiments demonstrated that maintaining the Fe as isolated atoms and incorporating nitrogen was essential to deliver the high performance. First principle calculations further attributed the high reactivity to the high efficiency of the single Fe atoms in transporting electrons to the adsorbed OH species.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201702473
Atomically FeN2 moieties dispersed on mesoporous carbon: A new atomic catalyst for efficient oxygen reduction catalysis,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdEarth-abundant materials with Fe-N-C centers have been identified as promising catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but these alternatives for Pt catalysts are usually the porphyrin-like FeN4 configuration. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that FeN2 outperforms FeN4 due to its lower interaction with *O2 and *OH intermediates and enhanced electron transport, however, achieving an optimum design of these earth-abundant materials with the enriched FeN2 catalytic centers is still a great challenge. Here, we report an intriguing template casting strategy to introduce a mass of atomically dispersed FeN2 moieties onto the surface of N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon for boosting ORR electrocatalysis. One of unique parts herein is to pre anchor Fe precursor on the surface of template (SBA-15) during catalyst synthesis, preventing Fe from penetrating into the carbon skeleton and facilitating the removal of excessive Fe-based particles during silica elimination by HF etching, resulting in a desirable model structure comprising only highly active atomically dispersed FeN2 sites, as confirmed by high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and Mößbauer spectroscopy analysis. The well-defined structure prompts us to understand the nature of the catalytic active sites, and to demonstrate that the catalyst activity is linearly proportional to the concentration of FeN2 sites. The obtained atomic electrocatalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for ORR with a more positive half-wave potential than that of Pt/C catalyst. We further establish a kinetic model to predict the ORR activity of these single-atom dispersed catalysts. The present work elaborates on a profound understanding for designing low-cost, highly efficient FeN2-based electrocatalyst for boosting ORR.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.03.027

Capitalizing on the advanced compositional and structural features, the as-prepared catalysts possessed excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and outperforms commercial Pt/C catalyst.",Small,10.1002/smll.201603407
Simple-Cubic Carbon Frameworks with Atomically Dispersed Iron Dopants toward High-Efficiency Oxygen Reduction,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Iron and nitrogen codoped carbons (Fe-N-C) have attracted increasingly greater attention as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Although challenging, the synthesis of Fe-N-C catalysts with highly dispersed and fully exposed active sites is of critical importance for improving the ORR activity. Here, we report a new type of graphitic Fe-N-C catalysts featuring numerous Fe single atoms anchored on a three-dimensional simple-cubic carbon framework. The Fe-N-C catalyst, derived from self-assembled Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices, was prepared by in situ ligand carbonization followed by acid etching and ammonia activation. Benefiting from its homogeneously dispersed and fully accessible active sites, highly graphitic nature, and enhanced mass transport, our Fe-N-C catalyst outperformed Pt/C and many previously reported Fe-N-C catalysts for ORR. Furthermore, when used for constructing the cathode for zinc-air batteries, our Fe-N-C catalyst exhibited current and power densities comparable to those of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00004
Small Dopants Make Big Differences: Enhanced Electrocatalytic Performance of MoS2 Monolayer for Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) by N– and P–Doping,"© 2016 Elsevier LtdThe design and development of low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial to the large-scale commerical application of fuel cells. Herein, by means of comprehensive densty functional theory (DFT) computations, we explored the potential of the heteroatom doping (N and P) to activate the basal plane of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayer for ORR in acidic medium. Our computations revealed that substituting S in MoS2 monolayer with N or P atom can introduce high spin density into MoS2 basal plane, leading to its improved chemical reactivity for the O2 activation, and the subsequent ORR steps prefer to proceed though a more efficient 4e pathway. Especially, N-doped MoS2 monolayer exhibits outstanding ORR catalytic performance in terms of its small overpotential (0.67 V) and low energy barrier (0.25 eV), which is comparable (even lower) to those of Pt–based electrocatalysts. In contrast, the catalytic activity of P–doped MoS2 monolayer is considerably poor due to its very strong interaction with O* and OOH* species in the subsequent reactions. Therefore, we expect that N-doped MoS2 monolayer is a quite promising single-atom-catalyst with high efficiency for ORR in fuel cells.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.12.144
Atomically Dispersed Iron–Nitrogen Species as Electrocatalysts for Bifunctional Oxygen Evolution and Reduction Reactions,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRational design of non-noble materials as highly efficient, economical, and durable bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR) is currently a critical obstacle for rechargeable metal-air batteries. A new route involving S was developed to achieve atomic dispersion of Fe-Nxspecies on N and S co-decorated hierarchical carbon layers, resulting in single-atom bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts for the first time. The abundant atomically dispersed Fe-Nxspecies are highly catalytically active, the hierarchical structure offers more opportunities for active sites, and the electrical conductivity is greatly improved. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits higher limiting current density and a more positive half-wave potential for ORR, as well as a lower overpotential for OER under alkaline conditions. Moreover, a rechargeable Zn–air battery device comprising this hybrid catalyst shows superior performance compared to Pt/C catalyst. This work will open a new avenue to design advanced bifunctional catalysts for reversible energy storage and conversion devices.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201610119
Single platinum atoms electrocatalysts: Oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation reactions,Atomically dispersed catalyst consisting of Pt atoms arranged in a c(2 × 2) array on RuO2(110) substrate was prepared. A large interatomic distance of Pt atoms in a c(2 × 2) phase precludes the reactants to interact with more than one Pt atoms. A strong bond of Pt atoms with RuO2 prevents agglomeration of Pt atoms to form 2D-islands or 3D-clusters. Activities of single Pt atom catalyst for the oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation reactions were determined and compared with those of bulk Pt. It has lower catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and similar activity for hydrogen oxidation reaction compared to Pt(111). This was explained by a large calculated up-shift of the d-band center of Pt atoms and larger Pt-Pt interatomic distance than that of Pt(111). This information is of considerable interest for further development of electrocatalysis.,Croatica Chemica Acta,10.5562/cca3176
Atom-scale dispersed palladium in a conductive Pd0.1TaS2 lattice with a unique electronic structure for efficient hydrogen evolution,"© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Noble metal catalysts have extraordinary catalytic activity but suffer from high cost; therefore single atom catalysis attracts tremendous attention. Here, we propose atom-scale dispersed palladium (Pd) in a layered TaS2 lattice to form new compounds of PdxTaS2, whose crystal structure was resolved by powder X-ray diffraction. The electrical conductivity of metallic Pd0.1TaS2 (1.36 × 104 S m-1) is twice as large as that of TaS2 (6.18 × 103 S m-1). This compound applied as a new electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) exhibits excellent catalytic performance with an onset overpotential of 77 mV, superior to those of other catalysts such as TaS2 (295 mV) and Pd-loaded TaS2 (114 mV). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the interaction of Pd-4d and Ta-5d orbitals results in the upshift of the Fermi level (TaS2versus Pd0.1TaS2) to decrease the barrier height for the HER. Furthermore, the hybridization of Pd-4d and S-3p orbitals builds up pathways along the c axis to improve the conductivity and promote HER performance. It is noted that the amount of Pd used in Pd0.1TaS2 is only 4 wt%, compared with 20 wt% in commercial Pd/C catalysts, which is beneficial for its practical application.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c7ta06447k
Platinum single-atom and cluster catalysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction,"© The Author(s) 2016.Platinum-based catalysts have been considered the most effective electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction in water splitting. However, platinum utilization in these electrocatalysts is extremely low, as the active sites are only located on the surface of the catalyst particles. Downsizing catalyst nanoparticles to single atoms is highly desirable to maximize their efficiency by utilizing nearly all platinum atoms. Here we report on a practical synthesis method to produce isolated single platinum atoms and clusters using the atomic layer deposition technique. The single platinum atom catalysts are investigated for the hydrogen evolution reaction, where they exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic activity (up to 37 times) and high stability in comparison with the state-of-the-art commercial platinum/carbon catalysts. The X-ray absorption fine structure and density functional theory analyses indicate that the partially unoccupied density of states of the platinum atoms' 5d orbitals on the nitrogen-doped graphene are responsible for the excellent performance.",Nature Communications,10.1038/ncomms13638
Quantum Mechanical Screening of Single-Atom Bimetallic Alloys for the Selective Reduction of CO2 to C1 Hydrocarbons,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to energy-rich hydrocarbons such as alkanes, alkenes, and alcohols is a very challenging task. So far, only copper has proven to be capable of such a conversion. We report density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with the Poisson-Boltzmann implicit solvation model to show that single-atom alloys (SAAs) are promising electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to C1 hydrocarbons in aqueous solution. The majority component of the SAAs studied is either gold or silver, in combination with isolated single atoms, M (M = Cu, Ni, Pd, Pt, Co, Rh, and Ir), replacing surface atoms. We envision that the SAA behaves as a one-pot tandem catalyst: first gold (or silver) reduces CO2 to CO, and the newly formed CO is then captured by M and is further reduced to C1 hydrocarbons such as methane or methanol. We studied 28 SAAs, and found about half of them selectively favor the CO2 reduction reaction over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Most of those promising SAAs contain M = Co, Rh, or Ir. The reaction mechanism of two SAAs, Rh@Au(100) and Rh@Ag(100), is explored in detail. Both of them reduce CO2 to methane but via different pathways. For Rh@Au(100), reduction occurs through the pathway ∗CO → ∗CHO → ∗CHOH → ∗CH + H2O(l) → ∗CH2 + H2O(l) → ∗CH3 + H2O(l) → ∗ + H2O(l) + CH4(g); whereas, for Rh@Ag(100), the pathway is ∗CO → ∗CHO → ∗CH2O→ ∗OCH3 → ∗O + CH4(g) → ∗OH + CH4(g) → ∗ + H2O(l) + CH4(g). The minimum applied voltages to drive the two electrocatalytic systems are -1.01 and -1.12 VRHE for Rh@Au(100) and Rh@Ag(100), respectively, at which the Faradaic efficiencies for CO2 reduction to CO are 60% for gold and 90% for silver. This suggests that SAA can efficiently reduce CO2 to methane with as small as 40% loss to the hydrogen evolution reaction for Rh@Au(100) and as small as 10% for Rh@Ag(100). We hope these computational results can stimulate experimental efforts to explore the use of SAA to catalyze CO2 electrochemical reduction to hydrocarbons.

"Activating earth-abundant electrocatalysts for efficient, low-cost hydrogen evolution/oxidation: Sub-monolayer platinum coatings on titanium tungsten carbide nanoparticles","© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Most earth-abundant electrocatalysts suffer from negligible activity for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and significant overpotentials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. We designed earth-abundant, carbon-supported titanium tungsten carbide (TixW1-xC) nanoparticles decorated with surface Pt coatings ranging from the ""single-atom"" to the two-monolayer regime. Reactivity studies demonstrated that sub-monolayer Pt coverages are optimal and could activate the exposed metal carbide sites for both HER and HOR at low overpotentials. Specifically, a 0.25 monolayer coverage of Pt improved the exchange current density of Ti0.2W0.8C by more than three orders of magnitude. This catalyst outperformed traditional Pt/C by a factor of 13 on a Pt mass basis, allowing for over a 96% reduction in Pt loadings. Deactivation was not observed after 10 000 cycles between -50 and +600 mV vs. RHE in 1.0 M HClO4, and activity was maintained after 140 000 catalytic turnovers. A technoeconomic analysis revealed that over the catalyst lifetime, this new architecture could reduce materials and energy costs by a factor of 6 compared to state-of-the-art earth-abundant catalysts and a factor of 12 compared to Pt/C.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/c6ee01929c
Tackling CO Poisoning with Single-Atom Alloy Catalysts,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Platinum catalysts are extensively used in the chemical industry and as electrocatalysts in fuel cells. Pt is notorious for its sensitivity to poisoning by strong CO adsorption. Here we demonstrate that the single-atom alloy (SAA) strategy applied to Pt reduces the binding strength of CO while maintaining catalytic performance. By using surface sensitive studies, we determined the binding strength of CO to different Pt ensembles, and this in turn guided the preparation of PtCu alloy nanoparticles (NPs). The atomic ratio Pt:Cu = 1:125 yielded a SAA which exhibited excellent CO tolerance in H2 activation, the key elementary step for hydrogenation and hydrogen electro-oxidation. As a probe reaction, the selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethene was performed under flow conditions on the SAA NPs supported on alumina without activity loss in the presence of CO. The ability to maintain reactivity in the presence of CO is vital to other industrial reaction systems, such as hydrocarbon oxidation, electrochemical methanol oxidation, and hydrogen fuel cells.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.6b03339
Availability of surface boron species in improved oxygen reduction activity of Pt catalysts: A first-principles study,"© 2016 Author(s).The oxidation process of boron (B) species on the Pt(111) surface and the beneficial effects of boron oxides on the oxygen reduction activity are investigated by first-principles calculations. The single-atom B anchored on the Pt surface has a great attraction for the oxygen species in the immediate environment. With the dissociation of molecular oxygen, a series of boron oxides is formed in succession, both indicating exothermic oxidation reactions. After BO2 is formed, the subsequent O atom immediately participates in the oxygen reduction reaction. The calculated O adsorption energy is appreciably decreased as compared to Pt catalysts, and more approximate to the optimal value of the volcano plot, from which is clear that O hydrogenation kinetics is improved. The modulation mechanism is mainly based on the electron-deficient nature of stable boron oxides, which normally reduces available electronic states of surface Pt atoms that bind the O by facilitating more electron transfer.

Driving the Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Nonlinear Cooperativity in Bimetallic Coordination Catalysts,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Developing efficient catalysts for electrolysis, in particular for the oxygen evolution in the anodic half cell reaction, is an important challenge in energy conversion technologies. By taking inspiration from the catalytic properties of single-atom catalysts and metallo-proteins, we exploit the potential of metal-organic networks as electrocatalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A dramatic enhancement of the catalytic activity toward the production of oxygen by nearly 2 orders of magnitude is demonstrated for novel heterobimetallic organic catalysts compared to metallo-porphyrins. Using a supramolecular approach we deliberately place single iron and cobalt atoms in either of two different coordination environments and observe a highly nonlinear increase in the catalytic activity depending on the coordination spheres of Fe and Co. Catalysis sets in at about 300 mV overpotential with high turnover frequencies that outperform other metal-organic catalysts like the prototypical hangman porphyrins.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.5b10484
Single-atom catalyst of platinum supported on titanium nitride for selective electrochemical reactions,"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.As a catalyst, single-atom platinum may provide an ideal structure for platinum minimization. Herein, a single-atom catalyst of platinum supported on titanium nitride nanoparticles were successfully prepared with the aid of chlorine ligands. Unlike platinum nanoparticles, the single-atom active sites predominantly produced hydrogen peroxide in the electrochemical oxygen reduction with the highest mass activity reported so far. The electrocatalytic oxidation of small organic molecules, such as formic acid and methanol, also exhibited unique selectivity on the single-atom platinum catalyst. A lack of platinum ensemble sites changed the reaction pathway for the oxygen-reduction reaction toward a two-electron pathway and formic acid oxidation toward direct dehydrogenation, and also induced no activity for the methanol oxidation. This work demonstrates that single-atom platinum can be an efficient electrocatalyst with high mass activity and unique selectivity.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.201509241
Comparative theoretical study of formic acid decomposition on PtAg(111) and Pt(111) surfaces,"© 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Pt-based catalysts are known as the best electrocatalysts for formic acid (HCOOH) oxidation. Maximizing their use efficiency and reducing the CO poisoning effect are highly desirable, however, very challenging. Aiming at these interesting issues, this work presents a theoretical study of the catalytic decomposition of HCOOH on an ideal single-atom model catalyst of PtAg nanostructures, which consists of isolated Pt atoms anchored to an Ag(111) surface and is referred to as PtAg(111). The barrier of the rate-determining step of HCOOH decomposition to CO2 on PtAg(111) is calculated to be 0.38 eV, which is not significantly different from that on a pure Pt(111) surface, 0.35 eV. On the other hand, the barrier of HCOOH decomposing to CO on PtAg(111) is found to be higher than that on pure Pt(111), 0.83 vs. 0.67 eV. These results indicate that the single-atom PtAg(111) (Pt-decorated Ag(111) surface) presents promising catalytic performance for HCOOH oxidation, which promotes HCOOH dehydrogenation to CO2 as good as pure Pt(111) and inhibits HCOOH dehydration to undesirable CO that poisons the catalyst. The present results rationalize the experimental observation that Pt-Ag alloy electrocatalysts show improved catalytic performance toward HCOOH oxidation, and provide a clue for the rational design of Pt-based single-atom catalysts.",RSC Advances,10.1039/c5ra01925g
From single crystal surfaces to single atoms: Investigating active sites in electrocatalysis,"Electrocatalytic processes will undoubtedly be at the heart of energising future transportation and technology with the added importance of being able to create the necessary fuels required to do so in an environmentally friendly and cost effective manner. For this to be successful two almost mutually exclusive surface properties need to be reconciled, namely producing highly active/reactive surface sites that exhibit long term stability. This article reviews the various approaches which have been undertaken to study the elusive nature of these active sites on metal surfaces which are considered as adatoms or clusters of adatoms with low coordination number. This includes the pioneering studies at extended well defined stepped single crystal surfaces using cyclic voltammetry up to the highly sophisticated in situ electrochemical imaging techniques used to study chemically synthesised nanomaterials. By combining the information attained from single crystal surfaces, individual nanoparticles of defined size and shape, density functional theory calculations and new concepts such as mesoporous multimetallic thin films and single atom electrocatalysts new insights into the design and fabrication of materials with highly active but stable active sites can be achieved. The area of electrocatalysis is therefore not only a fascinating and exciting field in terms of realistic technological and economical benefits but also from the fundamental understanding that can be acquired by studying such an array of interesting materials. © the Partner Organisations 2014.",Nanoscale,10.1039/c4nr00419a
Highly active small palladium clusters supported on ferric hydroxide for carbon monoxide-tolerant hydrogen oxidation,"Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells have been regarded as one of the most promising candidates for efficient energy conversion. However, the CO poisoning of the anode and the scarcity of the Pt metal are two major barriers to their commercialization. Development of CO-tolerant Pd electrocatalysts is considered to be a plausible approach to overcome these problems. Herein we report that for the CO-tolerant H2 oxidation, sub-2-nm size Pd clusters as well as single atoms, supported on FeOx nanocrystallites, are highly active and durable at a wide temperature range of 20-120 °C. Experimental data demonstrated that CO preferentially adsorbs on these small Pd clusters or single atoms linearly, resulting in weakened CO binding and enhanced H2 competitive adsorption. Therefore, FeOx-supported small Pd clusters or single atoms provide a higher CO-tolerant performance. This finding may offer a new strategy to develop CO-tolerant Pd-based electrodes. Small and fine wins every time: FeOx-supported Pd clusters of sub-2-nm size are extremely active and durable for CO-tolerant H2 oxidation over a wide temperature range (20-120 °C). The high activity originates from the very small clusters and even single-atom dispersion of Pd, which results in weakened adsorption of CO. Copyright © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Catalytically active single-atom niobium in graphitic layers,"Carbides of groups IV through VI (Ti, V and Cr groups) have long been proposed as substitutes for noble metal-based electrocatalysts in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. However, their catalytic activity has been extremely limited because of the low density and stability of catalytically active sites. Here we report the excellent performance of a niobium-carbon structure for catalysing the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction. A large number of single niobium atoms and ultra small clusters trapped in graphitic layers are directly identified using state-of-the-art aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. This structure not only enhances the overall conductivity for accelerating the exchange of ions and electrons, but it suppresses the chemical/thermal coarsening of the active particles. Experimental results coupled with theory calculations reveal that the single niobium atoms incorporated within the graphitic layers produce a redistribution of d-band electrons and become surprisingly active for O2 adsorption and dissociation, and also exhibit high stability. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In situ controllable growth of Prussian blue nanocubes on reduced graphene oxide: Facile synthesis and their application as enhanced nanoelectrocatalyst for H2O2 reduction,"As a single-atom-thick carbon material with high surface area and conductivity, graphene provides an ideal platform for designing composite nanomaterials for high-performance electrocatalytic or electrochemical devices. Herein, we demonstrated a facile strategy for controllably growing high-quality Prussian blue nanocubes on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (PBNCs/rGO), which represents a new type of graphene/transition metal complex heterostructure. The merit of this method is that the composite nanomaterials could be produced directly from GO in an in situ wet-chemical reaction, where the reduction of GO and the deposition of PBNCs occurred simultaneously. The obtained composite nanomaterials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques. It was found that uniform PBNCs with controlled size and good dispersion were directly grown on the surface of graphene nanosheets. Moreover, we also investigated the performance of PBNCs/rGO nanocomposites as amperometric sensor toward reduction of H2O2. Such a sensor showed a rapid and highly sensitive response to H2O2 with a low detection limit (45 nM), which might find promising applications in developing a new type of enzymeless biosensor. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/am100372m
