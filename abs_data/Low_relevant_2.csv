Highly transparent bismuth borotellurite glass-ceramics: Comprehension of crystallization mechanisms,"© 2022Understanding the mechanism at play during the partial crystallization of a parent glass remains crucial for controlling the optical properties of the final glass-ceramics. In this work, we study the crystallization of bismuth borotellurite glasses, where a specific investigation on the 60TeO2–20B2O3–20Bi2O3 composition is reported. Under adapted heat treatment conditions, highly transparent glass-ceramics can be obtained: the crystallization of the unique anti-glass Bi2Te4O11 phase is evidenced by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy data confirm its disordered nature. While the quenched glass appears homogeneous, the observation of the early stages glass-ceramic samples by transmission electron microscopy reveals the formation of isolated polycrystalline Bi2Te4O11 entities scattered in a predominant glassy matrix. However, longer heat-treatment of samples induce some chemical demixtion of the residual glass matrix, where two separate amorphous regions of a different composition coexist. The resulting material is finally constituted of the aforementioned Bi2Te4O11 polycrystalline clusters dispersed within a majority of regions with a Te/Bi ratio larger than the nominal 1.5 ratio, separated by tiny “venules” strongly impoverished in tellurium and also likely containing boron element. Photoluminescence properties of Eu3+-doped samples indicate that tiny spectral and temporal modifications happen with the crystallization, reflecting the persistent disordered surrounding of the rare-earth ions.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121953
Impedance spectroscopy of Na2S – V2O5 – P2O5 glass-ceramic nanocomposites,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The dielectric properties of the 13.5 Na2S – 32.5 V2O5–54 P2O5 glass was thoughtfully examined after the glass was traditionally quenched and thermally treated for different treatment durations of 4, 6 and 12 h. Ac impedance spectroscopy, dielectric constant, loss tangent and electric modulus were all studied for various frequencies ranging from 500 Hz to 1 MHz and at temperatures from 303 to 573 K. The 12 h glass-ceramic nanocomposite exhibited the highest conductivity compared to other samples. The activation energy for conductivity, W, and for relaxation processes, Eτ, are obtained where both values are in the range of (0.498–0.414 eV). The stretched exponent β was estimated to be in the range of (0.82–0.93) indicating a Non-Debye type relaxation process.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121941
Chemical strengthening of lithium aluminosilicate glass-ceramic with different crystallinity,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The chemically strengthened lithium aluminosilicate glass-ceramic with petalite phase has excellent performance and can be used in electronic mobile devices such as electronic display substrates, cover plates and light guide plates. The role of petalite crystals in Li+-Na+ ion exchange is elucidated. The effect of different crystallinity on Li+-Na+ ion exchange in lithium aluminosilicate glass-ceramics was investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Raman spectroscopy, electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) and other performance test. The results show that when the glass-ceramic crystals are exchanged with Li+-Na+ ions for more than 10 h, part of the crystals in the exchange layer will decrystallize. The surface stress, Vickers hardness and flexural strength of lithium aluminosilicate glass-ceramic with a crystallinity of 73.6%±3% after Li+-Na+ ion exchange at 450 °C for 6 h reach 418±3 MPa, 7.45±0.1 GPa and 450±3 MPa, respectively.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121940
Near-infrared rechargeable glass-based composites for green persistent luminescence,"© 2022 The Author(s)The fabrication of Yb3+, Tm3+ co-doped oxyfluorophosphate glass-based composites, with green persistent luminescence after being charged with near-infrared light, is demonstrated. The mechanism responsible for the green afterglow after near-infrared illumination is unveiled. The composite is prepared using a modified melting process to limit the evaporation of fluorine during melting. Intense (blue and ultraviolet) up-conversion emission is obtained by optimizing the Yb2O3 and Tm2O3 concentrations. A heat treatment promotes volume precipitation of Yb3+, Tm3+ co-doped CaF2 crystals. Although the intensity of the blue up-conversion emission from the Tm3+ 1G4 level is lower in the highly Yb3+-concentrated glass-ceramic due to reverse energy transfer from Tm3+ to Yb3+, the heat treatment leads to an increase of the intensity of the emissions around 346 nm, 361 nm nm and 450 nm coming from the Tm3+ 1I6 and 1D2 levels. By combining the Yb3+ and Tm3+ ions with SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+crystals, green afterglow can be obtained after charging with near-infrared light.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.167048
"Tb4O7-Sm2O3 co-doped glass ceramics containing Ba3Gd(PO4)3: Preparation, tunable emission and temperature sensing properties","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Tb4O7-Sm2O3 co-doped transparent glass ceramics (GCs) containing Ba3Gd(PO4)3 crystalline phase were prepared by melt crystallization. The heat treatment condition for GCs was determined to be 740 ℃/2 h by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmittance curves. The optical energy bandgap value of glass ceramics is smaller than that of glass. The fluorescence lifetime and Dexter theory demonstrated the energy transfer from Tb3+ to Sm3+. The luminescence color can be adjusted in the white range when the Sm2O3 doping concentration is changed. At 473 K, the luminous intensity of Tb3+ and Sm3+ can be maintained 86.63 % and 89.36 % of that at room temperature, respectively. The maximum values of the absolute and relative sensitivity of the glass ceramics are 0.00525 K−1 and 2.33 % K−1, respectively. This study shows that the obtained luminescent glass ceramics have potential applications in ultraviolet excited white light emitting diodes and optical thermometry.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.167020
Sintered glass-ceramic foams from fluorite tailings and waste glass with calcium phosphate addition,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLightweight glass-ceramic foams as novel building and decoration materials exhibit great advantages. Herein, fluorite tailings and waste glass were recycled to sinter glass-ceramic foams by introducing calcined kaolin and calcium phosphate. The effects of calcium phosphate addition and sintering temperature on the crystalline phase, microstructure evolution, fluoride leaching performance and physical properties of the glass-ceramic foams were systematically investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectra, computed tomography, and differential scanning calorimetry. The obtained glass-ceramic foams sintered at 1110 °C exhibited relatively homogeneous pore sizes and distributions, low densities and thermal conductivities, and high compressive strengths. Moreover, the addition of calcium phosphate promoted the formation of fluorapatite, which benefited the toxic fluorine stabilization in the glass-ceramic foams. Thermodynamic data were calculated using Factsage 8.1 and verified through experiments to establish the physical structure transition during sintering. This study provides an efficient utilization route to convert fluorite tailings and waste glass into stable and valuable lightweight glass-ceramic foams.",Construction and Building Materials,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.129528
Double-life sustainable construction materials from alkali activation of volcanic ash/discarded glass mixture,"© 2022 The Author(s)Volcanic ash, according to the large amount of silica and alumina, may be considered as feedstock for geopolymers. However, the relatively low reactivity, mostly due to the relatively low amount of amorphous phase, implies the introduction of ash as minor component in complex mixtures and the activation with highly concentrated alkaline solutions. This paper aims at improving the sustainability of ash conversion into inorganic polymers with adequate strength-to-density ratio, by minimizing the addition of valuable compounds and including discarded material. Fine powders of volcanic ash from Mt Etna (Italy), in fact, were activated with NaOH solutions at low molarity (3 M), with a variable water/solid ratio (0.35–0.42), after mixing with waste glass powders, from cullet purification. The adopted ash/glass proportion (50 wt%-50 wt%) was intended to favour the reuse of inorganic polymers, by firing at 950 °C, in turn causing the transformation into porous glass-ceramics with a remarkable strength-to-density ratio. A significant foaming was effectively observed, due to decomposition of hydrated alkali alumino-silicates developed upon hardening. Foams with excellent strength-to-density ratio were also obtained by thermal transformation of highly porous cold consolidated materials.",Construction and Building Materials,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.129540
Effects of coordination field environment on the fluorescence properties of transparent ZnGa2O4 glass-ceramics doped with Mn2+ and Cr3+ ions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The transparent ZnGa2O4 glass-ceramics doped with Mn2+/Cr3+ ions were prepared by a one-step crystallization method. The visible light fluorescence properties of Mn2+ ions in 6-coordination and 4-coordination environments and the visible light fluorescence properties of Mn2+/Cr3+ ions co-doped in transparent ZnGa2O4 glass-ceramics were studied. The results manifest that in the parent glass, Mn2+ ions mainly occupy the network former in the form of Hexa-coordination, and the luminescence center can emit orange-yellow light at ~600 nm. In transparent ZnGa2O4 glass-ceramics, Mn2+ ions and Cr3+ ions appear at the four-coordination site (Zn site) and six-coordination site (Ga site) in ZnGa2O4 spinel, respectively, and they can radiate green (510 nm) and red light (688 nm), respectively. An energy transfer mechanism of Mn2+→Cr3+ exists in ZnGa2O4: Mn2+/Cr3+ and different colors of luminescence can be produced by changing the molar ratios of components and test conditions. CIE results show that Mn2+-single-doped parent glass and glass-ceramics can be used in orange-yellow and green light displays, while Mn2+/Cr3+ co-doped transparent ZnGa2O4 glass-ceramics can be used as ideal materials for the green and red light displays.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166844
"Structural, optical, and dielectric properties of Co2+: Zn2SiO4 glass-ceramics for blue phosphor used in optoelectronic devices","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.For the first time, the author reported the fabrication and characterizations of Co2+ doped Zn2SiO4 (Co2+: Zn2SiO4) using the recycled waste white rice husk ash (WRHA) based on empirical formula (Co3O4)1.0[(ZnO)55.0(WRHA)45.0]99.0 and produced by using melt-quenching technique. The precursor glass was heat treated at 700 ℃ until 950 ℃. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) result of Co2+: Zn2SiO4 showed that β- Zn2SiO4 started to form at 750 ℃ and single phase of α-Zn2SiO4 remain stable at 950 ℃. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the formation of Co2+: Zn2SiO4 by showing eight significant vibrational bands. One triplet absorption band occurred at around 450–700 nm attributed to 4A2 → 4T1 (4P) optical transition of Co2+ ions that gives blue color towards the Co2+: Zn2SiO4 sample. Emission spectroscopy of Co2+: Zn2SiO4 exhibit five different peaks corresponded to blue emission (~416 nm, ~441 nm, ~461 nm and ~481 nm) and green emission (~527 nm) under excitation at 325 nm. Such luminescence properties making Co2+: Zn2SiO4 as a potential phosphor material especially in providing blue emission supported by the excellent dielectric properties.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166726
Two-body wear resistance and fatigue survival of new Y-TZP and ATZ ceramics made with a new slip-casting method,"© 2022Background: Dental zirconium oxide restorations are milled from pre-sintered blocks or disks which are produced either with high isostatic pressure (HIP) or, simpler, a slurry technique. The objective was to perform a fatigue test and an in vitro wear simulation of two ceramics, yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (3Y-TZP) ceramic and a hybrid zirconium oxide-aluminum oxide ceramic, (ATZ) both produced either the classical way using high isostatic pressure (HIP, control) or with a slurry technique. Materials and methods: Ten discs/group were subjected to a cyclic biaxial fatigue test using a staircase approach under water at 37 °C in a dynamic universal testing machine. The 2-body wear test was performed on eight lapped 12 mm thick cylindrical samples subjected to spherical (ø 6 mm) leucite ceramic antagonists in a CS-4 chewing simulator at 49 N force and 0.7 mm lateral movement for 600 k cycles and 4167 thermal cycles (5–55 °C). Volumetric wear was calculated based on laser-scanned surfaces. Selected samples of both tests were viewed in SEM. Results: All the ceramic specimens produced using the HIP method survived up to 1.2 M cycles with the maximum load of the equipment (1000 N) loading the specimens up to 1527 MPa. The fatigue limit stress at 1.2 M cycles for the Slurry ATZ samples was 946 MPa. For the Slurry Y-TZP samples the fatigue limit stress at 1.2 M cycles was 658 MPa. At 600 k cycles, all zirconium oxide ceramics showed no measurable wear and had a highly polished appearance. The leucite ceramic antagonists wear developed in a linear way. There was no difference between the materials produced with the slurry and the HIP process. ATZ ceramic produced significantly more wear than 3Y- TZP ceramic. Conclusions: The HIP method provided higher fatigue strength than the Slurry manufacturing method. All HIP ceramics surpassed the limit threshold (1527 MPa) of the testing machine. The tested ceramics did not show any measurable wear but had worn the leucite reinforced glass ceramic antagonists for a considerable amount.",Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105535
Vibrational characteristics of aluminum–phosphate compounds by an experimental and theoretical approach,"© 2022, The Author(s).Aluminum phosphates are materials with relatively wide potential applications in many industries. The vibrational features of selected compounds were established on Raman and infrared spectroscopy. The experimentally determined spectra are compared to those calculated by ab initio methods. This gives a unique possibility of a proper assignment of the experimental spectral features to specific modes of vibration. In the results, it was evidenced that the spectra are characterized by two specific intense bands in the mid- and high-frequency range due to the P–O–P and P–O bonds in [PO4] tetrahedron vibrations. The position of the high-frequency band is related to the number of bridging oxygen atoms connecting [PO4] tetrahedrons in the unit cell. Additionally, the differences in the spectra were evidenced as a result of different polymorphic forms of the selected compounds. Therefore, the results may be useful in determining the phase composition of polyphase materials or structural features of aluminum–phosphate glasses and glass–ceramic materials.",Scientific Reports,10.1038/s41598-022-22432-5
Osteogenic commitment of strontium nanoparticles doped mesoporous bioactive glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The present work explores strontium(Sr) nanoparticles doped mesoporous bioactive glasses-ceramics (MBGCs) in the context of orthopaedic strategies that are compatible with vascularization. MBGCs doped nanoparticles are synthesized by evaporation induced self-assembly method. Small-angle X-ray scattering and electron microscopy experiments reveal the presence of Sr nanoparticles in the MBGCs. The mesoporous structure of the sample is explored by nitrogen adsorption–desorption. The present study reports the in-vitro biocompatibility of the Sr doped MBGCs during short-term immersed in up to one week in simulated body fluid. Finally, in-vitro cell culture studies reveal that Sr inclusion causes osteoblasts to be selectively affected. Sr increases early development towards the osteoblast phenotype while interfering with osteoclastogenesis. Based on these findings, Sr doped MBGCs can be offered as bone substitutes, particularly in the case of osteoporosis. Sr doped MBGCs can be recommend for future investigation on bone defect healing techniques due to their osteogenic potential.",Materials Science and Engineering B: Solid-State Materials for Advanced Technology,10.1016/j.mseb.2022.116068
Recent research on Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramics for expansion of applications,"© 2022 The Author(s)Applications of Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramics (LAS GC) have been extended to electronic and optical devices and production process equipment in addition to their conventional use in cookware. For further expansion and application to new markets, we demonstrate three topics of our research on the material and production processes from viewpoint of glass phases. The first topic is spherical LAS GC powder for a filler application. It has been developed successfully, which can be prepared in a single heat treatment where spheroidizing by viscous flow and crystallization are achieved simultaneously by considering the kinetics of the two phenomena. Second, high transparent LAS GC was obtained by the composition design of the glass-matrix phase, Ti-free, or increasing Al content based on the coloration mechanism.

Use of hazardous electric arc furnace dust in the construction industry: A cleaner production approach,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMany steel industries are adopting electric arc furnace (EAF) technology due to the growing demand for steel recycling and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, the major issue with EAF is the co-production of slag and dust (EAFD). Slag is a hard, dense, and rock-like material, while EAFD is fine dust. EAFD contains oxides of several heavy metals mostly present in input scrap steel or additives used for alloy making. Many environmental agencies have categorised EAFD as hazardous waste as EAFD disposed off in land leach heavy metals, contaminating the groundwater. Due to its hazardous nature, EAFD disposal imposes a substantial landfill cost on steel industries. Several studies have reported that EAFD can be utilised in the construction sector as a supplementary raw material for cement concrete, asphalt, bricks and ceramics, and other applications, instead of being disposed off in landfills that trigger environmental complications. Yet a review of EAFD reuse in sustainable building material production is lacking. This work reports EAFD production during steel manufacturing and its serious impact on environment, analyses the mechanisms involved in after the addition of EAFD as a secondary filler material in various construction components, namely concrete, asphalt, bricks, ceramics, and glaze. Insights into EAFD morphology and chemical composition and the effect of EAFD addition on the performance of the above components are also presented. This paper also provides an in-depth synthesis of the performance of building materials after EAFD incorporation in terms of workability, hydration, hardening process, mechanical performance, and durability. Literature reports that the fine nature of EAFD improves the workability of concrete and the plasticity of clay used in ceramic tiles and bricks. EAFD fills up the voids and improves water absorption, mechanical strength, and durability of the final product. Eventually, the performance of construction materials blended with EAFD is governed by the bond, quantity, and characteristics of EAFD, including morphology, particle size distribution, and composition. Laboratory trials are required to obtain the optimum mix of EAFD and the binder. Adding EAFD to construction materials is an economical and efficient approach to recycle waste and can be used to build infrastructure while reducing the environmental impact. The paper also discusses a few challenges in the current research and development and future perspectives on using EAFD as a supplementary material. The review anticipates providing a valuable guide to recycle EAFD in construction materials. Incorporating EAFD in building materials production could be a promising approach to a circular economy and cleaner production.",Journal of Cleaner Production,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134282
"Transparent Eu3+ doped oxyapatite glass ceramics: Crystallization kinetics, structural and optical properties","© 2022Transparent Eu3+-doped oxyapatite glass ceramics (GC) have been prepared. A mean crystallization activation energy of 389.58 kJ/mol is determined in crystallization kinetics study. The Avrami's parameter is evaluated to be 2.65, indicating that bulk crystallization is the dominant mechanism. Effect of Eu2O3 dopant on the crystallization behavior was discussed. The precipitation of oxyapatite nanocrystals exhibiting a slight lattice contraction in glass is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements, resulting from the partition of some europium ions into crystals. Photoluminescence analysis reveals that crystallization could promote the oxidation of Eu2+ to Eu3+ possibly due to europium ions partition on La3+ lattice sites. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectra indicate that such oxyapatite GC phosphor exhibits excellent thermal stability with an activation energy of 0.326 eV. This study reports the possibility of developing oxyapatite GC phosphor for light conversion application.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121918
Modification of CaO–B2O3–La2O3 glass powder and its application in low-temperature co-fired ceramic substrate,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.CaO–B2O3–La2O3 (CBL) glass is widely used in high-frequency packaging and co-firing with highly conductive metal electrodes as a new lead-free glass/ceramic system in low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) materials due to its multiple advantages, such as low softening point, controllable crystallisation properties, and chemical stability. The silane coupling agent, KH-570, was used as a surface modifier for preparing modified CBL glass powder to obtain a tape-casting slurry with low viscosity and excellent stability in a polymethyl methacrylate binder system; this system achieved better co-firing compatibility between the composite and Ag electrodes. In this study, the modification mechanism of the silane coupling agent with the powder is elucidated. The effects of the modified powder on the kinetic stability and rheological properties of the slurries were investigated. A slurry with a solid content of 39.6 vol% and lowest viscosity of 1500 mPa s could be obtained with the addition of 2 wt% KH-570. In particular, the uniformity of tape-casting slurry was observed during tape casting, leading to a difference in the density of green tapes, which increased from 2.45 (without KH-570) to 2.61 g/cm3 (with 2 wt% KH-570), and the tensile strength increased to 5.11 MPa. Simultaneously, the micromorphology and surface roughness of the green tapes and substrate were analysed by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The results showed an improvement in densification and a decrease in Ra after modification, resulting in the sintered substrate obtaining a higher density of 3.06 g/cm3 and a lower dielectric loss of 9.8 × 10−4 (12 GHz). The excellent co-firing compatibility between green tapes and silver paste at 850 °C was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. In this study, high-quality LTCC materials were manufactured by coupling modification, with their stable performance ensuring their wide application.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.160
"Analytical description of unstable, rugose, circular cracks in brittle solids","© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.This manuscript presents an improvement to the analytical model for unstable, circular cracks with rugose crack-fronts propagating in infinite, brittle solids including the velocity-dependent, fracture surface energy. Extensive testing and fracture surface characterization on silicate glass, glassy carbon, single-crystal silicon, and PMMA plates were conducted, and the results were compared to the model’s predictions. For each material, the fracture surface characteristics were extracted from profilometry scans, and the crack speed was estimated from fractographic features. The estimated crack speed for the materials considered was found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental observations. The model was also used to predict the formation of the ‘mirror-mist’ boundary in silicate glasses and glass–ceramics. It was found that using the proposed theoretical framework, the mirror constants were underestimated by only approximately 15%. The formation of mist could not be investigated for PMMA and single-crystal silicon as the mechanism of mist formation was inconsistent with the assumptions made in this work.",Archive of Applied Mechanics,10.1007/s00419-022-02272-5
Characterization of Ruby Color in Some Special Glass Compositions and Their Corresponding Glass–Ceramic Derivatives,"© 2022, The Author(s).Glasses of the system B2O3 – PbO – MgF2 – P2O5 – SiO2 containing different dopants from Cr2O3, MnO2, and SeO2 were prepared by the conventional melt quenching method. The prepared glasses were characterized by their ruby color caused by the effect of dopants. The amorphous nature of the prepared glasses was confirmed by x-ray diffraction (XRD). Differential thermal analysis (DTA) was used to design a heat treatment program to obtain their corresponding transparent glass–ceramic derivatives from parent glasses. Collective spectroscopic measurements were applied to evaluate the optical properties of glasses and their corresponding glass–ceramics. XRD and morphological analysis of glass–ceramics indicated the formation of two crystalline phases (PbO(B2O3)2) and (Mg2BO3F). Optical analysis confirmed the stability of the color even after heat treatment. The chromaticity coordinates indicated a deep red color related to the chromium dopant and red wine color for selenium and manganese dopants.",Journal of Electronic Materials,10.1007/s11664-022-09915-x
Probability of failure and weibull size-scaling parameters for thin glass subjected to two-point bending,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe two-point bending test is a valuable test for estimating the strength of the thin and flexible glass/ceramic parts that are increasingly used in next-generation flexible electronics devices. We present closed-form expressions for determining Weibull material scale parameters and probability of failure for the two-point bending test. The presented solution, tested on Corning® Willow® glass samples, eliminates the need for iterative and often time-consuming approaches (e.g., Finite Element Analysis) for estimating scale parameters. Considering the strength-controlling flaw distribution on a surface or inside a volume, the solution assumes that the Weibull modulus (m) and scaling modulus (mA or mV) are distinct quantities to ensure the scale parameter is independent of the applied load. This condition reveals a special relationship between the moduli that is unique to two-point bending given its highly non-uniform state of stress, which contrasts with other uniaxial bending tests (such as three and four-point bending) in which both moduli have the same numerical value.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.09.014
Effect of ZrO2 addition on the structure and the crystallization delay in lithium disilicate based glasses,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Lithium disilicate (LD) glasses in system (99-X)(1Li2O:2SiO2)-(1K2O)-XZrO2 (X ​= ​0, 1 and 2 ​mol %) have been synthesized by melt quenching technique and converted into glass-ceramics by three and four-stage heat treatment schedules. The sequence of phase formation in glass-ceramics with ZrO2 addition has been discussed. The activation energy of crystallization increases with the addition of ZrO2. Rietveld refinement and micro structural analysis show an increase in the amorphous content with the addition of ZrO2. 29Si MAS-NMR, Raman and XPS spectroscopy studies for the glasses reveal that the ZrO2 addition to LD based glasses causes network polymerization and changes the role of network modifying Li+ and K+ species into charge compensators. The increased connectivity of [ZrO6]2- units in the glass network restricts the mobility of Q2 [Si2O6]4-, Q3 [Si4O10]4- and Q4 [SiO2] units, which leads to an increase in activation energies of crystallization and hampers the devitrification ability of glasses.",Journal of Solid State Chemistry,10.1016/j.jssc.2022.123600
"Effect of Na/K ratio on structure evolution, dielectric and energy storage properties of potassium sodium niobate-based borate glass-ceramics","© 2022To reduce carrier mobility and optimize crystal phase species, 0.9((1-x)K2O-xNa2O-Nb2O5)-0.1B2O3 glass-ceramics were prepared by the traditional melting method. By introducing Na2O, Na0.9K0.1NbO3 ferroelectric phase increases, and the “rice-like” morphology grains transfer to the cubic grains gradually. As the radius of Na+ is smaller than K+, the ability of Na+ to provide free oxygen is weaker, which reduces the fracture degree of [BO3] and makes the glass network structure tend to compact. As a result, the stable high permittivity (158) and low dielectric loss (tanδ ≤ 0.04) are obtained in the broad frequency range (20 Hz to 1 MHz) and temperature range (25–200 °C). In addition, these samples also reveal a relatively high energy-storage density (1.64 J/cm3) under breakdown strength (490 kV/cm), which is mainly attributed to the dense glass network and optimized crystalline phase. Pulse discharge testing further verifies that the 0.9(0.5K2O-0.5Na2O-Nb2O5)-0.1B2O3 glass-ceramic achieves high actual energy-storage density (0.09 J/cm3) at lower electric field strengths, and fast charging and discharging speed (τ0.9 = 15 ns).",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121930
One step to stabilize calcium sodium phosphate crystals acting as photocatalysts embedded in a glass matrix,"© 2022Unstable calcium sodium phosphate (CaNaPO4) in aqueous solution can be stabilized and shows photocatalytic activity in a glass matrix. This research utilizes one-step melt quenching to prepare glass ceramics with stable CaNaPO4 crystals in a glass material. The photocatalytic activity of the CaNaPO4 glass ceramic was investigated by monitoring methyl orange degradation with the addition of H2O2. Notably, the CaNaPO4 glass ceramic demonstrates the high-efficiency photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) under UV irradiation. The CaNaPO4 glass ceramic could be reused several times. After 8 cycles, the catalyst was still stable and effective in decomposing 100% of methyl orange within 5 h/cycle. In addition, the solid phase photocatalytic activity of the CaNaPO4 glass ceramic was examined by bleaching adsorbed MB under UV light for 25 h. It could also inhibit the growth of E. coli bacteria after UV irradiation for 20 min. Therefore, CaNaPO4 embedded glass ceramic might be an alternative photocatalytic material for wastewater treatment.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121915
Persistent luminescence of Eu/Dy-doped Sr2MgSi2O7 glass-ceramics processed by aerodynamic levitation,"© 2022 The AuthorsGlass beads of the Sr2MgSi2O7 stoichiometric composition and a non-stoichiometric composition with higher SiO2/SrO ratio doped with Eu2O3/Dy2O3 were prepared through aerodynamic levitation coupled to CO2 laser heating. The glass beads were subsequently treated at 1100 ºC to produce glass-ceramics with Sr2MgSi2O7: Eu2+, Dy3+ as the main crystalline phase. The doped glasses exhibit red emissions; after crystallisation, the corresponding glass-ceramics emit blue light under UV excitation. The starting glass composition considerably affects the crystallisation process, resulting in Sr2MgSi2O7 glass-ceramics with very different microstructures which, in turn, have a significant influence on the luminescence properties. The photoluminescence emission spectra of the glass-ceramics under UV light show a broadband emission (λ = 400–500 nm) with a main peak assigned to the typical Eu2+ transition under excitation at 365 nm. Both the intensity of the emission and the persistence time significatively increase on decreasing temperature.

Here, a molybdenum (Mo)-containing bioactive glass ceramic scaffold with solid-strut-packed structures (Mo-scaffold) was printed, and its ability to regulate pro-osteogenic and anti-osteoclastogenic cellular responses was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. We found that extracts derived from Mo-scaffold (Mo-extracts) strongly stimulated osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and inhibited differentiation of osteoclast progenitors. The identified comodulatory effect was further demonstrated to arise from Mo ions in the Mo-extract, wherein Mo ions suppressed osteoclastic differentiation by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibiting mitochondrial biogenesis in osteoclasts. Consistent with the in vitro findings, the Mo-scaffold was found to significantly promote osteoblast-mediated bone formation and inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption throughout the bone healing process, leading to enhanced bone regeneration. In combination with our previous finding that Mo ions participate in material-mediated immunomodulation, this study offers the new insight that Mo ions facilitate bone repair by comodulating the balance between bone formation and resorption. Our findings suggest that Mo ions are multifunctional cellular modulators that can potentially be used in biomaterial design and bone tissue engineering.",International Journal of Oral Science,10.1038/s41368-022-00195-z
"Scaffolds in the microbial resistant era: Fabrication, materials, properties and tissue engineering applications","© 2022 The AuthorsDue to microbial infections dramatically affect cell survival and increase the risk of implant failure, scaffolds produced with antimicrobial materials are now much more likely to be successful. Multidrug-resistant infections without suitable prevention strategies are increasing at an alarming rate. The ability of cells to organize, develop, differentiate, produce a functioning extracellular matrix (ECM) and create new functional tissue can all be controlled by careful control of the extracellular microenvironment. This review covers the present state of advanced strategies to develop scaffolds with antimicrobial properties for bone, oral tissue, skin, muscle, nerve, trachea, cardiac and other tissue engineering applications. The review focuses on the development of antimicrobial scaffolds against bacteria and fungi using a wide range of materials, including polymers, biopolymers, glass, ceramics and antimicrobials agents such as antibiotics, antiseptics, antimicrobial polymers, peptides, metals, carbon nanomaterials, combinatorial strategies, and includes discussions on the antimicrobial mechanisms involved in these antimicrobial approaches. The toxicological aspects of these advanced scaffolds are also analyzed to ensure future technological transfer to clinics. The main antimicrobial methods of characterizing scaffolds’ antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties are described. The production methods of these porous supports, such as electrospinning, phase separation, gas foaming, the porogen method, polymerization in solution, fiber mesh coating, self-assembly, membrane lamination, freeze drying, 3D printing and bioprinting, among others, are also included in this article. These important advances in antimicrobial materials-based scaffolds for regenerative medicine offer many new promising avenues to the material design and tissue-engineering communities.",Materials Today Bio,10.1016/j.mtbio.2022.100412
Effects of I and W co-doping on the structural and electrochemical characteristics of Na3SbS4 glass-ceramic electrolytes,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Sodium-ion batteries are becoming a feasible choice for large-scale energy storage because of their low cost and vast selection of cathode materials. Here we report the design and synthesis of Na3SbS4–Na2W0.77S4I0.6 glass-ceramic electrolyte. A high room-temperature conductivity of 4.97 mS cm−1 was achieved by I doping. In this sulfide super-ionic conductor structure, I-substitution loosened the local bonding between Na and S (or I). The Sb in the SbS43− unit was replaced by W with a higher valence state, producing sodium vacancies while maintaining the 3D conduction pathways and resulting in fast ion transport. Additionally, the electrolyte Na3SbS4–Na2 W0.77S4I0.6 exhibited advantage of air stability against the humid atmosphere, which is a promising sulfide electrolyte for all solid-state sodium battery application.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.109
Blue luminescence of Cs2CuCl4 glass ceramics with long-term water-resistance stability,"© 2022Metal halide Cs2CuCl4 has shown great potential in photovoltaic and photoelectric applications, but it is sensitive to oxygen, moisture, light and temperature. To improve its stability, we make Cs2CuCl4 nanocrystals precipitated from borosilicate glass synthesized by traditional melting and quenching method. The prepared glass ceramics have an absorption band at 374 nm and an intense blue emission band at 465 nm, showing long-term water-resistance stability after immersing this sample in water for 80 days. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the strong band observed in the excitation spectra can be attributed to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition. Theoretical calculation and spectral studies showed Cs2CuCl4 nanocrystals absorbed the excitation ultraviolet by LMCT and then transfer the energy to Cu+, so the blue emission originated from transition 3d94p1 → 3d10 of Cu+ defects in Cs2CuCl4 nanocrystals. Our work not only demonstrates Cs2CuCl4 glass-ceramics as a promising sky-blue phosphor, but also presents a new general method to improve the stability of lead-free metal halides, paving the way to their applications.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121867
"Solid-state NMR investigation of fast sodium ion-conducting glass–ceramics: The system Na3+3x−yRE1−xPySi3−yO9 (RE = Sc, Y)","© 2022 The Authors. Journal of the American Ceramic Society published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Ceramic Society.Glasses and glass–ceramics of composition Na3+3x−yRE1−xPySi3−yO9 were synthesized using RE = Sc and Y, x = 0.4, and y = 0.0 and 0.3 to obtain multiple-phase glass–ceramics containing the highly conducting Na5RESi4O12 (N5) phase. In addition, the two model compounds Na5ScSi4O12 and Na5InSi4O12 were synthesized. Samples were characterized at two distinct annealing stages using X-ray powder diffraction, electrical conductivity measurements, and multinuclear solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The N5 phase is dominantly formed for Sc-containing glass–ceramics (both with y = 0.0 and 0.3) at crystallization temperatures above 900°C. For the other glass–ceramics, the crystallized phases were dominantly Na3RESi2O7 (N3), RE = Sc and Y, and Na9YSi6O18 (N9) phases. 29Si MAS-NMR peak assignments were done with the aid of 29Si{45Sc} rotational echo adiabatic passage double resonance (REAPDOR) experiments. 29Si and 23Na MAS-NMR spectra reveal complex phase compositions and local environment distributions, which could be largely assigned based on known semiempirical chemical shift correlations with average Si–O and Na–O bond distances. 31P MAS and 31P{45Sc} REAPDOR NMR results suggest the presence of orthophosphate groups, arguing against the literature model of isostructural substitution of silicon by phosphorus in the N5 phase.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/jace.18705
High discharge energy density and ultralow dielectric loss in alkali-free niobate-based glass-ceramics by composition optimization,"© 2022The SrO-BaO-Nb2O5-SiO2 glass-ceramics with different (Sr, Ba)/Nb ratio were prepared by the melting-crystallized process. With the decrease of (Sr, Ba)/Nb, the bonding species and crystallization activation energy of the glass-ceramics were changed obviously, which caused the change of phase compositions and microstructures on a microscopic scale and the fluctuations of dielectric constant and breakdown strength on a macroscopic scale. Finally, the theoretical energy storage density was up to 18.93 J/cm3 with a dielectric constant of 84 and breakdown strength of 2256.73 kV/cm. What is more, the dielectric loss was less than 0.004 at room temperature. Furthermore, under the electric field of 640 kV/cm the discharge energy density of the optimal sample (S5) reached 1.14 J/cm3 which overtopped what has been reported and the discharge time (t0.9) was less than 16 ns. Above analysis suggested that the alkali-free niobate-based glass-ceramics have broad application prospects.",Scripta Materialia,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2022.114993
Robocasting of multicomponent sol-gel–derived silicate bioactive glass scaffolds for bone tissue engineering,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Robocasting is universally recognized as an affordable and reproducible manufacturing strategy to process glass and glass-ceramic materials in the form of highly ordered porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering (BTE) applications. Nevertheless, while being widely applied to melt-derived bioactive glasses, this technique was seldom implemented with sol-gel materials due to the intrinsic difficulties in producing suitable inks for extrusion and thus, good printing outcomes. The present experimental work describes a new and relatively easy method to manufacture multicomponent sol-gel bioactive silicate scaffolds (oxide system: 47.5SiO2–20CaO–10MgO–10Na2O-10 K2O-2.5P2O5, mol.%) using dried gels as basic material within the ink composition, which allows by-passing intermediate heat treatments that are usually detrimental to the bioactive potential of the material in physiological environment. The scaffolds, exhibiting a total porosity of 81 vol%, were characterized in terms of morphological-compositional features and bioactivity in simulated body fluid (SBF), paying special attention to ion release and surface modifications occurring upon soaking (apatite-forming ability). The compressive strength of the scaffolds (around 5 MPa) was comparable to that of human cancellous bone. Collectively, the results supported the possibility of using robocast sol-gel–derived scaffolds in BTE approaches. Furthermore, a comparison with robocast scaffolds based on a melt-derived glass with the same composition was reported in order to investigate the effect of the synthesis route on the dissolution behavior and morphological features of the final biomaterials.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.121

Rietveld refinement of synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) measurements as a function of temperature and pressure confirmed the stable crystalline structure of PbSiO3, with a monoclinic crystal system in the P12/n1 (13) space group. The samples were heated to 973 K at ambient pressure and compressed to 6 GPa at room-temperature.

"Morphological, optical, structural, mechanical, and radiation-shielding properties of borosilicate glass–ceramic system","© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.This study explores the morphological, optical, structural, mechanical, and radiation-shielding properties of borosilicate glass–ceramic samples modified with titanium oxide and various ratios of barium oxide. The morphology of the glass–ceramic system was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mechanical properties, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to identify the fabricated sample structures. The optical properties were calculated to define the refractive index and band gap (Eg). The shielding properties were obtained by Monte Carlo simulation (MC) and compared with XCOM software data. Glass samples were converted to glass–ceramic samples at 800 °C for 6 h, and the GC25 and GC30 samples were converted to completely crystalline phases as illustrated by the XRD, FTIR, and Raman results, unlike the GC15 and GC20 samples. The XRD results showed the trigonal structure of BaB2TiO6 with the R-3 space group for the GC25 and GC30 samples and the tetragonal phase of TiO2 with the P42/mnm space group for the GC15 and GC20 samples. The sharp FTIR and Raman spectrum peaks affirm the crystal phase for G25 and G30 samples. The parent glass of the GC20 sample showed the highest mechanical moduli (Young's, bulk, shear, and longitudinal) and Poisson ratio. Concurrently, the addition of BaO instead of B2O3 caused a gradual reduction in the packing factor, dissociation energy, and microhardness. The Phy-X program was used to theoretically assess the shielding properties. The obtained results showed the highest compatibility between the Monte Carlo N-particle (MCNP) and XCOM software results, and the GC30 sample displayed the highest shielding properties due to adding BaO instead of B2O3. The crystalline phase and shielding features of the samples were improved by increasing the BaO ratio, indicating that the current samples are suitable for radiation-shielding applications.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.124
The dual role of bismuth in Li2O–Bi2O3–B2O3 glasses along the orthoborate join,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.The structures of glasses in the lithium–bismuth orthoborate composition range deviate significantly from the short-range order structure of the two crystalline end-members. Although binary Li3BO3 and BiBO3 are solely of comprised trigonal orthoborate anions, all glasses formed by their combination contain four-coordinated borate tetrahedra. We analyze the structure of (75−1.5x)Li2O–xBi2O3–(25+0.5x)B2O3 glasses in increments of x = 5, with 11B magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR), and Raman spectroscopy. For the full series, the oxygen-to-boron ratio remains constant at O/B = 3:1. NMR quantifies an increase in the fraction of tetrahedral boron with increasing bismuth oxide content. Evolution of the mid-IR profile suggests multiple types of tetrahedral boron sites. Raman spectroscopy reveals that Bi2O3 tends to cluster within the lithium borate matrix when initially introduced and that this behavior transforms into a bismuthate network with increasing bismuth oxide content. In all cases, mixed Bi–O–B linkages are observed. The dual role of bismuth as network modifier and network former is likewise observed in the far IR. The glass transition temperature continuously increases with bismuth oxide content; however, the glass stability displays a maximum in the multicomponent glass of x = 40.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/jace.18699
Achieving ultrafast discharge speed and excellent energy storage efficiency in environmentally friendly niobate-based glass ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdEnvironmentally friendly Na2O–BaO–Nb2O5–SiO2 glass ceramics (GCs) with different vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) contents were successfully synthesized using the conventional melt-quenching method and heat treatment. The microstructure and dielectric energy storage properties of the GCs could be related to the addition of V2O5. When 1 mol% of V2O5 was added, the activation energy of crystallization decreased from 282 to 221 kJ/mol, and the GCs had the highest energy efficiency of 95.96% and breakdown strength of 1326 kV/cm. Moreover, the GCs could also achieve an ultrafast discharge time of 14 ns and an actual discharge energy density of 0.724 J/cm3.

"Immobilization of Cs and Sr within perovskite-type Ba0.7-ySry(La, Cs)0.3ZrO3 glass/ceramic composite waste forms","© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The disposal of radioactive Cs and Sr in high-level radioactive waste is a problem that needs to be considered in the nuclear industry. Currently, it is difficult to immobilize Cs and Sr simultaneously into a durable host phase, especially at low temperatures to avoid volatilization of Cs. Thus, perovskite-type Ba0.7-ySry(La, Cs)0.3ZrO3 (y ≤ 0.6) polycrystalline was synthesized by sol-gel technique at low temperatures and developed as a host to immobilize Cs and Sr. The polycrystalline powders were further fixed in glass matrix to form the glass/ceramic composite waste forms. The results show that Cs and Sr can be immobilized effectively in the lattice positions of Ba0.7-ySry(La, Cs)0.3ZrO3 at a low temperature (900 °C), without volatilization of Cs during the immobilization process. The glass/ceramic composite waste forms with a crystalline-amorphous phase inlaid structure, prepared with glass content of 40 wt% and sintering temperature of 800 °C, have low porosity, good compactness, and high hardness. The leaching rates of Cs and Sr in the waste forms can reach the order of 10−3 - 10−4 g m−2 d−1 after 14 days. This result provides an ideal host of Ba0.7-ySry(La, Cs)0.3ZrO3 for simultaneous immobilization of Cs and Sr at low temperatures, and combines the advantages of traditional glass solidification and promising ceramic solidification.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.007
Synthesis and in vitro characterization of superparamagnetic γ-Fe2O3-containing 13–93 bioactive glasses for bone cancer therapy,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Osteosarcoma is one of the most common types of bone cancer, which generally starts in the long bones. In this study, superparamagnetic maghemite-containing (2, 5, 10, 20 wt%) bioactive glass powders were prepared for the treatment of osteosarcoma. For this purpose, maghemite nanoparticles were synthesized using the co-precipitation technique, and maghemite-containing bioactive glass-ceramic composites were fabricated through the sol-gel process. The structural, morphological, thermal, and magnetic properties and the in vitro bioactivity of the prepared bioactive glasses were investigated. In vitro cytotoxicity was examined using SaOS-2 and MC3T3-E1 cells. The fluorouracil (5-FU) release behavior of the studied bioactive glass powders was also monitored in phosphate-buffered saline as a function of time. Results revealed that synthesized maghemite nanoparticles as well as the maghemite-containing bioactive glass-ceramic composites have superparamagnetic properties. They have high bioactivity, with up to 5 wt% maghemite content. Prepared bioactive glass composites have no cytotoxicity against osteosarcoma and pre-osteoblast cells at low concentrations. Drug-loaded bioactive glass powder showed sustained release behavior. Overall results indicated that prepared glass composites have a high potential to be used in magnetic hyperthermia and anticancer drug release applications for the treatment of bone cancer.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.017
Ultrahigh hardness Li2O–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 glass–ceramics containing multiphase nanocrystals,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.Li2O–Al2O3–SiO2-based glass–ceramics containing nanocrystals have attracted much attention due to their low expansion coefficient, good mechanical properties, for different applications, such as fire-safe glass, dental materials, and electronic devices protectors. In current research, ultrahigh hardness Li2O–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 glass–ceramics were prepared by conventional melt-quenching and subsequent heat-treatment method. MgO was introduced via Li2O substitution to change glass crystallization and mechanical properties. The differential scanning calorimetry analysis indicated the glass transition and crystallization temperatures increased with MgO/Li2O ratio increase, for better glass network connectivity from Raman spectra analysis. In addition, the main crystal phase changed from Li2SiO5 and LiAlSi4O10, to the combination of LiAlSi2O6 and MgAl2Si4O12, and finally to MgAl2Si4O12. The Vickers hardness of glass–ceramics was highly dependent on MgO/Li2O ratios in glass components and heat-treatment temperatures, corresponding with the crystal phases in glass–ceramics. The highest hardness could reach 9.34 GPa, which was much higher than traditional silicate glass–ceramics. The scanning electron microscope images confirmed the crystal diameters that varied from 30 to 100 nm and were determined by MgO content. Transmission electron microscope images and energy-dispersive spectroscopy mapping also confirmed the precipitation of multiphase nanocrystals in glass matrix. The changes of glass structure, and corresponding crystal combinations in glass–ceramics resulting from MgO introduction, were responsible for the ultrahigh hardness glass.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/jace.18689
Femtosecond laser induced amorphization of quantum dots and application in three-dimensional optical data storage,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.The information burst in modern society poses new challenges to information preservation technology, both in storage efficiency, capacity, and security. Multi-dimensional optical data storage based on the femtosecond laser direct writing technique is a promising way to face these challenges. Herein, a new optical storage method based on femtosecond laser-induced local darkening of CdSe quantum dots doped glass is reported. Photoluminescence image and spectrum indicate that highly luminescent well-crystallized CdSe quantum dots can be amorphized by a single femtosecond laser pulse and reconstructed by thermal treatment, resulting in reversible luminescence modulation, in which the luminous efficacy of CdSe quantum dots in glass matrix was well recovered after each cycle of writing and erasing. Complicated patterns written inside the glass and multi-layer information are also successfully inscribed and well demonstrated. Data bit could be written by just one 380 fs single pulse with pulse energy as low as 100 nJ. The present work provides a potential way for three-dimensional optical information storage and data encryption with low power consumption, fast writing speed, large capacity, and high security.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/jace.18691
Up-conversion luminescence transparent CaNb2O6 glass ceramics for temperature monitoring,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.To explore new up-conversion luminescent materials with high sensitivity for optical thermometry, Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped transparent CaNb2O6 glass ceramics are successfully prepared using the traditional melting and controlling crystallization. Its structure, micro-morphology and luminescence characteristics are studied comprehensively by means of XRD, Raman, TEM and a fluorescence spectrometer. The results show that the luminescence intensity of glass ceramics is significantly higher than that of glasses under 980 nm laser excitation. A dual-mode temperature measurement based on fluorescence intensity ratios (FIR, I690/I796 and I690/I651) is realized by using the different temperature dependence of emission peaks of Tm3+. In a wide temperature range (298 − 573 K), the highest absolute sensitivity (Sa-max) of 0.42‰ K−1 and the supreme relative sensitivity (Sr-max) of 2.65% K−1 based on thermal coupling energy levels (TCELs) are gained. Furthermore, using non-thermal coupling energy levels (NTCELs), Sr-max and Sa-max reach 0.23% K−1 and 20.49% K−1, respectively. This work indicates that the CaNb2O6 glass ceramics as a new type of up-conversion luminescent material have great application prospects in the field of optical thermometry.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.029
Synthesis of porous glass ceramics with hierarchical and interconnected pores from secondary aluminum dross and waste glass,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Secondary aluminum dross (SAD) is a hazardous solid waste discharged during the production and recycling of aluminum. However, it is still a challenge for us to the utilization of SAD rationally. Herein, the facile particle-stabilized foam approach was proposed to employ SAD combined with waste glass as raw materials to synthesize hierarchical porous glass ceramics. The development pores in the products involves the initial closed pores with a mean diameter of 35–74 μm derived from mixed particles-stabilized foams, followed by open windows with a mean diameter of 21 μm. Furthermore, secondary pores of around 3 μm on the cell wall formed after sintering. The influence of solid loadings and SAD dosage on the foamed green body and sintering shrinkage has been investigated. Optimized porous glass ceramics possess an open porosity of 76.90%, bulk density of 0.71 g/cm3 and also with a compressive strength of 5.14 MPa.

LnUO4-based glass–ceramic composites as waste forms for the immobilization of lanthanide-bearing uranium wastes,"© The Authors. Journal of the American Ceramic Society published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Ceramic Society.We report a comprehensive study on lanthanide monouranate–based glass–ceramic (GC) composites as potential waste forms for the immobilization of the lanthanide actinide fraction waste arising from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Although the crystalline LnUO4 precursor prepared via a nitrate route can be well stabilized in a sodium aluminoborosilicate glass, the in situ crystallization of EuUO4 in glass from oxide precursors (Eu2O3 and U3O8) is rather robust with regards to various processing conditions such as waste loadings, ceramic-to-glass ratios, and cooling rates. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy investigations revealed the detailed microstructures, where ∼1–5-μm spheres for NdUO4 and EuUO4, and ∼1–5-μm rectangular crystals for DyUO4 and HoUO4 were observed in residual glasses. As designed, the pentavalent uranium has been confirmed by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Overall, LnUO4-based GC composite waste forms are chemically durable, offering flexible processing options with wide operating windows for SNF and process waste stream management.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/jace.18678
Effect of strontium-doped bioactive glass-ceramic containing toothpaste on prevention of artificial dentine caries formation: an in vitro study,"© 2022, The Author(s).Backgroud: Root caries in aging population was prevalent worldwide. Due to the absence of enamel and specific structure of dentine, bacteria are able to penetrate further into dentine at an earlier stage of lesion development. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of adding of a strontium-doped bioactive glass-ceramic (HX-BGC) to a fluoride-free toothpaste on prevention of formation of artificial dentine caries. Methods: Thirty-six human tooth specimens were allocated to three groups (n = 12 per group). Group 1 treated with slurry containing a fluoride-free toothpaste and 5% HX-BGC, Group 2 was treated with fluoride-free toothpaste slurry, and Group 3 received deionized water as a negative control. The specimens were subjected to four cycles (15 h demineralization and 8 h remineralization for one cycle) of biochemical cycling. A mixed suspension of five bacteria species (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii) were prepared in brain heart infusion broth with 5% sucrose and used as acidic challenge in biochemical cycling. Subsequently, surface morphology of the dentine lesion was assessed by scanning electron microscopy, while the lesion depths and mineral loss were assessed by micro-computed tomography. Results: The mean lesion depths in dentine in Groups 1 to 3 were 87.79 ± 16.99 μm, 101.06 ± 10.04 μm and 113.60 ± 16.36 μm, respectively (p = 0.002). The mean amounts of mineral loss in Groups 1 to 3 were 0.82 ± 0.10 g/cm3, 0.89 ± 0.09 g/cm3 and 0.96 ± 0.11 g/cm3, respectively (p = 0.016). No obvious differences in the surface morphology were seen among the groups. Conclusion: Addition of strontium-doped bioactive glass-ceramic to fluoride-free toothpaste has potential to reduce formation of dentine lesions.",BMC Oral Health,10.1186/s12903-022-02321-z
"Study of visible, NIR, and MIR spectroscopic properties of Er3+-doped tellurite glasses and glass–ceramics","© 2022 The Authors. Journal of the American Ceramic Society published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Ceramic Society.In this paper, the structural, thermal, optical, and spectroscopic properties of Er3+-doped tellurite glasses with the composition 68.25TeO2–19.5ZnO–9.75X–2.5Er2O3 (in mol%) with X = BaO, Na2O, and Bi2O3 are reported. The glasses were prepared using the standard melt quenching method. The investigated glasses exhibit low phonon energy (∼745 cm−1) and low glass transition temperature varying between 300 and 350°C depending on the glass composition. The Raman spectra show a regular tellurite structure with variations in the number of bridging and non-bridging oxygens depending on the glass composition, the Na2O and Bi2O3-containing glasses having the most and the least polymerized network, respectively. A thermal treatment of the glasses leads to the formation of crystals, the composition of which depends on the glass composition, as revealed by X-ray diffraction analysis and confirmed using scanning electron microscope-energy-dispersive spectroscopy. The precipitation of Er-containing crystals in the Na2O and BaO-containing glasses leads to an increase in the intensity of the upconversion emissions. Although the Er3+ ions remain in the amorphous part of the Bi2O3-containing glass after heat treatment, it is the precipitation of Bi3.2Te0.8O6.4 crystals in this glass, which is thought to decrease the distance between the Er3+ ions leading to an increase in the intensity of the upconversion and mid-infrared emissions.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/jace.18649
Influence of restorative material translucency on the chameleon effect,"© 2022, The Author(s).Blending of artificial restoration materials to the natural tooth is challenging. Beyond just color, optical properties, particularly translucency, substantially influence the final appearance. The more chameleon effect that the restorative materials exhibit, the more natural looking restorations. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of restorative material translucency on the chameleon effect. Five types of resin composite in three different shades as well as one shade of conventional glass ionomer cement were fabricated into disks. To analyze the chameleon effect, glass ceramic blocks were milled to create four wells in each block. The restorative materials were filled into the wells. The color was measured with CIE L*a*b* every 6 months. Statistical analysis was conducted using Two-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA. The material with the highest translucency was flowable resin composite. The high translucency materials exhibited an immediate chameleon effect, as did the bulk-fill resin composites, which are low translucency. Both high and low translucency materials exhibited a delayed chameleon effect for 3 years, except for the bulk fill resin composites. The translucency of the restorative materials had a 68% positive correlation with their chameleon effect. The age of the restoration is one important factor influencing the color blending.",Scientific Reports,10.1038/s41598-022-12983-y
Effect of aqueous environment on wear resistance of dental glass–ceramics,"© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Wear resistance affects dental ceramics longevity and the functions of the opposing teeth. However, data for the effect of aqueous environment on wear resistance of dental ceramics are lacking. This study evaluated the effect of aqueous environment on wear resistance of typical dental glass–ceramics. Methods: Disk specimens were prepared from lithium disilicate glass–ceramics (LD) and leucite reinforced glass–ceramics (LEU). The disk specimens paired with steatite antagonists were tested in a pin-on-disk tribometer under both wet and dry conditions with 10 N up to 500,000 wear cycles. The wear analysis of glass–ceramics was performed using a 3D profilometer after 100,000, 300,000 and 500,000 wear cycles. Wear morphologies were analyzed by employing scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The crystalline compositions of specimens stored in a dry environment and subsequently immersed in distilled water for 40 h were separately determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The chemical states of the wear surfaces for LD were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The data analysis and multiple pair-wise comparisons of means were performed by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post-hoc test. Results: LEU in a wet environment exhibited less wear volume loss than that in a dry environment (p < 0.05). The volume loss of LD in a wet environment was higher than that in a dry environment (p < 0.05). The wear volumes of steatite antagonists paired with two glass–ceramics under dry conditions were higher than under wet conditions. Conclusions: XPS spectra of LD under wet conditions indicated that high wear loss might result from the effect of stress corrosion by water and reaction of water with the ionic-covalent bonds at the crack tip. XPS spectra and SEM images of LD under dry conditions showed a possible formation of tribofilm. Within the limitations of this in vitro study, water was wear-friendly to LEU and all opposing steatites but aggravated wear for LD.",BMC Oral Health,10.1186/s12903-022-02183-5
Morphology of subsurface cracks in glass-ceramics induced by Vickers indentation observed by synchrotron X-ray multiscale tomography,"© 2022, The Author(s).The characterization of subsurface cracks induced by indentation is a challenge for understanding contact damage, impact, wear, erosion, and abrasion of brittle materials, because the crack pattern observable on the surface is only a part of the total crack system. Here we applied synchrotron X-ray multiscale tomography to observe the morphology of subsurface cracks produced by Vickers indentation in a novel CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramic with plate-like crystals forming a house-of-cards microstructure. It revealed a diverse type of crack systems around the semispherical microcrack zone beneath the indent, including a new mode II inclined lateral crack driven by the maximum shear stress. Tomography images provided knowledge on how the heterogeneous microstructure affected the toughening processes such as crack deflection, crack bridging, and microcracking.",Scientific Reports,10.1038/s41598-022-11084-0
SU-8 cantilever with integrated pyrolyzed glass-like carbon piezoresistor,"© 2022, The Author(s).Glass-like carbon (GC) is a nongraphitizing material composed entirely of carbon atoms produced from selected organic polymer resins by controlled pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere. The GC properties are a combination of the properties of glass, ceramic, and graphite, including hardness, low density, low thermal conductivity, high chemical inertness, biocompatibility, high electrical conductivity, and microfabrication process compatibility. Despite these unique properties, the application of GC in mechanical sensors has not been explored thus far. Here, we investigate the electrical, structural, and chemical properties of GC thin films derived from epoxy-based negative photoresist SU-8 pyrolyzed from 700 to 900 °C. In addition, we fabricated microGC piezoresistors pyrolyzed at 700 and 900 °C and integrated them into nonpyrolyzed SU-8 cantilevers to create microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) mechanical sensors. The sensitivities of the GC sensor to strain, force, surface stress, and acceleration are characterized to demonstrate their potential and limits for electromechanical microdevices.",Microsystems and Nanoengineering,10.1038/s41378-022-00351-9
Laminate veneer ceramics in aesthetic rehabilitation of teeth with fluorosis: a 10-year follow-up study,"© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Fluorosis is one of the color anomalies seen in teeth. White lines and blurred areas associated with mild fluorosis are barely noticeable; in its severe form, tooth enamel surface changes ranging from staining and pitting may be observed. The treatment of fluorosis not only provides aesthetic and functional correction but also helps to improve the patient's self-esteem. Methods: The present retrospective study evaluated the clinical quality, success rate, and estimated survival of porcelain laminate veneers in teeth with anterior fluorosis. Three hundred fifty-eight porcelain laminate veneers (254 in the anterior maxilla and 104 in the mandible) were ""functional"" restorations that covered the incisal edge and part of the palatal/lingual side of the tooth with a 1 mm high palatal bevel. Ceramic veneers were fabricated with lithium disilicate reinforced glass–ceramic material (IPS e.max Press, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein). The modified United States Public Health Service criteria were used for clinical evaluation of the restorations. Results: On the basis of these criteria, marginal adaptation, color match, marginal discoloration, surface roughness, restoration fracture, tooth fracture, restoration wear, antagonist tooth wear, caries and postoperative sensitivity were evaluated yearly. The survival rate in the current study was ≥ 0.997 for 10 years. Conclusions: The results of this clinical study should encourage clinicians to consider ceramic veneers over crown restorations when restoring the smile of patients with advanced fluorosis.",BMC Oral Health,10.1186/s12903-022-02079-4
Crystallization behavior and enhanced fluorescence properties of Yb3+/Ho3+/Tb3+ co-doped transparent glass-ceramics containing oxyapatite-type Na3YSi2O7 crystals,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The Yb3+/Ho3+/Tb3+ co-doped Na2O-Y2O3-SiO2 system transparent glass-ceramics containing oxyapatite-type Na3YSi2O7 (NYS) crystals were prepared. The structure of the crystal was characterized by XRD and TEM. The most suitable heat treatment process was confirmed by DSC and TEM results. The strongest emission peak in the fluorescence spectra relates to the Tb3+: 5D4→7F5 transition. In the CIE chromaticity diagram, the luminescence is concentrated in the green area. The emission intensity of the glass-ceramic is increased by 7 times compared with the precursor glass. The increase in emission intensity is caused by the entry of rare-earth ions into the Na3YSi2O7 grains to replace the positions of Y3+ ions. The fluorescence properties of the glass-ceramics containing Na3YSi2O7 crystals were tested at different temperatures. It is demonstrated that the luminescent materials show good thermal stability. The obtained glass-ceramic would be a candidate material for green diode elements.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166573
Study on low-cost preparation of glass–ceramic from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash and lead–zinc tailings,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMunicipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash and lead–zinc tailings contain heavy metals and are detrimental to the environment. However, conventional melt disposal requires high temperatures, resulting in high costs. This study used coal gangue as a flux to reduce the melting temperature, and the one-step process successfully prepared the CaO-SiO2-Al2O3 series glass-ceramics. The results show that the solidification effect of diopside ferrous crystals on heavy metals is higher than that of anorthite and gehlenite, and the leaching concentration of heavy metals conforms to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Chinese National (GB 5058.3) standard limits. This study provides a reference for the efficient, green, low-cost treatment of MSWI fly ash, lead–zinc tailings, and coal gangue.",Construction and Building Materials,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.129231
Effect of limestone powder on the properties of alkali-activated materials – A critical overview,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdAs known, the earth crust is rich with limestone. The limestone powder (LSP) accounts for about 75 % of the composition of Portland cement (PC). It can be used as cement replacement and in other fields and applications such as agriculture field, metal refining field, gaseous effluents field, production of glass, ceramic, mineral wool, pulp and paper, sodium dichromate and organic chemical due to its wide availability and low cost. Recently, incorporating LSP into different types of geopolymer became a hot topic and became more attention than before. The studies focused on the effect of LSP on the properties of different types of geopolymer may or may not be compatible with each other. This review abridged the available studies focused on the effect of different ratios of LSP on the fresh and hardened properties of different types of geopolymer. The positive or negative effects of LSP on the reaction kinetics, workability, setting time, mechanical strength, water absorption/permeability, carbonation resistance, abrasion resistance and shrinkage were abridged. Some empirical equations obtained from the regression analyses of the results and statistics were established. This review showed that LSP increased the workability. In most cases, LSP at ratios ≤ 30 % increased the compressive strength of slag, metakaolin-clay and fly ash/slag geopolymers, whilst it increased the strength of natural pozzolan at any ratio. The incorporation of 15 % LSP reduced water absorption, but higher ratios increased it. Most of the previous studies reported lower drying shrinkage with including LSP. The setting time was mostly affected by the type of precursor and LSP ratio. No clear trend can be obtained from the effect of LSP on the carbonation resistance and abrasion resistance due to the limitation of the available studies.",Construction and Building Materials,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.129188
Syntheses and characterization of Twofold Nepheline-Combeite Glass-Ceramics for Dental Application,"© 2022Synthesis of glass-ceramics with a combination of specific crystalline phases can lead in materials with superior chemical, physical and mechanical properties. The aim of this study is to outline the potential of synthesizing a novel glass system which crystallise into two crystalline phase's nepheline-combeite and provide an end monolithic glass-ceramics via sinter crystallization route for dental applications. Four novel glass compositions based on the Na2O-CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 system were synthesized using the melt-quench method. Glasses were designed to contain 6 mole % of CaO and a total of 35 mole % of Al2O3 and Na2O. Experimental glasses were ground into fine powders and then sinter crystallized to monolithic glass-ceramics. The developed glasses and glass-ceramics were characterized using DSC, Dilatometry, X-ray diffraction, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS-NMR) and scanning electron microscopy. This study shows how the nepheline phase can be produced in combination with other secondary crystalline phases which allow tailoring of the chemical, physical and thermal properties of both the starting glasses and the end glass-ceramics, including their thermal expansions coefficients, glass transition temperatures, softening points, sintering and melting temperatures.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121877
Scalable synthesis of millimeter-sized porous MgTi4(PO4)6 photocatalyst via glass-ceramic combined acid-leaching route,"© 2022Glass frit particles were prepared by conventional melting and water quenching method. The frit crystallized to form a glass-ceramic with MgTi4(PO4)6 as the crystalline phase. A porous glass-ceramic material consisting of MgTi4(PO4)6 crystal nanoflakes were successfully obtained by acid leaching of the glass-ceramic. The selective leaching of Mg and P, Ti from the residual glass phase in the glass-ceramic was evidenced. Experiments show that the prepared porous particles have excellent photocatalytic performance toward dye molecules in simulated waste water. Due to its large particle size, the synthesized photocatalyst could be easily recovered after the use. The present study suggests that photocatalysts could be produced in a large-scale and with a low cost via the traditional glass route.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121870
Effect of kaolin addition on the sinter-crystallisation kinetics of compacts of a crystallising frit,"© 2022Non-isothermal techniques were used to study the sintering and crystallisation kinetics of an anorthoclase- and diopside-devitrifying frit and mixtures of this frit with a commercial kaolin. Raising kaolin content was verified to delay sintering and crystallisation and to increase the degree to which both processes overlapped, which decreased the sinterability of the material. In addition, raising kaolin content lowered the resulting diopside content, which cancelled out for the mixture with 16 wt% kaolin, while the shape, size, and composition of the anorthoclase crystals also changed. The kinetic parameters of the sinter-crystallisation processes were determined, and a model was developed that appropriately describes sintering kinetics. The model assumes the process develops in two parallel, partly overlapping stages, each of which can be described by the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts (KWW) relaxation function.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121864

This study discusses the structure of the ceramic-metal surface layer of a porous nickel-titanium alloy (nitinol) and the corrosion resistance in simulated physiological liquids. The structure of the protective layer and glass-ceramic non-metallic inclusions in the surface of the porous alloy have been studied. The formation of the surface ceramic-metal layer and crystallization of various glass-metal-ceramic phases as a result of chemisorption from reaction gases and epitaxial growth from the gas phase during the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis are observed.,Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.07.296
Preparation and study of borate glass-ceramics coated γ-Ce2S3 red pigment,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this study, the core–shell wrapping structure red pigment with γ-Ce2S3 colorant as core and borate glass-ceramics as shell was prepared by low temperature self-propagating combustion method with solid sulfur as sulfur source. The effects of H3BO3 addition amount on the chromaticity and temperature stability of the coated pigment were studied. It was found that when the addition amount of nB/Ce was equal to1.40, the coated pigment with the optimal stability and chromaticity value can be obtained, and its redness value (a*) was 42.01. This coated pigment still maintained a certain redness (a*=30.86) after calcined at 680 °C for 10 min in air. This indicates that the temperature stability of borate glass-ceramics coated γ-Ce2S3 red pigment with core–shell structure can be improved from 350 °C to 680 °C.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154293
Determination of the Mechanical Properties of Contemporary Dental Composite Materials by a Stretching Method,"© 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.We describe here a physical investigation method for determining measures of the strength of dental composite materials using samples with different cross-sectional areas. Tensile strength data complement the existing characteristics of composites, so the work is relevant and promising for therapeutic dentistry. The studies reported here tested and described five of the newest dental composites. A block diagram of the IM-4R tensile testing machine is presented, along with its external appearance. The operation of the IM-4R is described, along with pre-testing sample loading and sample appearance after rupture. The experimental results are summarized in Table 1. The measurement results show that mechanical stress (strength) relates to the cross-sectional area of dental composites via third-order polynomials; the reliability of the approximation is assessed, and the sample with best mechanical properties is identified.",Biomedical Engineering,10.1007/s10527-022-10211-5
Sugarcane waste based synthesized graphene like nanocarbon (GNC) for shock absorption application,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.We report on the synthesis, characterization, and shock absorption characteristics of Graphene like Nano Carbon (GNC) prepared by the combustion of biomass (sugarcane waste) using the Rapid Thermal Chemical Vapor Deposition (RT-CVD) technique. Post synthesis, the samples were purified by subjecting them to intercalation and annealing. The synthesised GNCs were then characterised by Raman, Infrared, and UV spectroscopy, together with microscopy. In analysis, the GNCs were observed to be rectangular in shape, thick, having sharp edges and corners, and having an area ∼50-200 μm2 with wrinkles on it. TEM images showed that GNCs exhibit smooth wrinkle contours with bits of dark showing conjugated graphene layers stacked together having multiple defects and dislocations. In Raman spectroscopy, D peak is observed at ∼1335 cm−1 and G peak is observed at ∼1591 cm−1 indicating GNC consists of sp2 and sp3 hybridised complex phases. The Crystalline Length (La), Disordered Length (LD) and Defect Density (nD) have been estimated to be 21.26 nm, 9.60 nm and 1.084 × 10−12/cm2 respectively. FTIR spectra revealed that C-C is present at ∼1420 cm−1 and C-O-C is present at 900 cm−1. In Uv measurements, no typical absorption peak was observed due to the micrometre size of GNC. The shock absorption properties of GNCs were investigated by subjecting them to pressure (~1.5 GPa) using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB). The obtained mechanical parameters revealed that GNCs absorbed ∼65% of incident energy and ∼15% transmitted, demonstrating their utility in the development of armour, shock and blast mitigating blocks, defense, and space applications.",Physica Scripta,10.1088/1402-4896/ac96d8
An eco-friendly and highly sensitive loofah@CF/CNT 3D piezoresistive sensor for human activity monitoring and mechanical cotrol,"© 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Three-dimensional (3D) porous piezoresistive sensors are widely used because of their simple fabrication and convenient signal acquisition. However, because of the dependence on organic skeleton materials and the complexity of conductive coating preparation, the electrical and mechanical properties of 3D wearable piezoresistive sensors have gradually failed to accommodate many emerging fields. Here, a new flexible 3D piezoresistive sensor (NF3PS) with high sensitivity and a wide measurement range is proposed, which comprises a natural porous loofah as a flexible framework and carbon fiber/carbon nanotube (CF/CNT) multiscale composite as a conductive coating. Composed of cellulose and lignin, the irregular, porous loofah has excellent mechanical strength, elasticity, and toughness, ensuring a repeated compression/recovery behavior of the NF3PS. In addition, compared with the single-size carbon coating, the coupling of multiscale CF/CNT composite coating improves sensitivities over a range of pressures. The NF3PS demonstrates a sensitivity of 6.94 kPa−1 with good linearity in the pressure range of 0–11.2 kPa and maintains a sensitivity of 0.28 kPa 1 in an ultrawide measurement range of 11.2–84.6 kPa. Considering flexibility, robustness, and wide-ranging linear resistance variation, the feasibility of the NF3PS in human activity monitoring, mechanical control, and smart homes is verified. This work provides a novel strategy for a new generation of 3D flexible pressure sensors for improving sensitivity and measurement range and demonstrates attractive applications in wearable sensors.",Science China Technological Sciences,10.1007/s11431-022-2204-2
Current state of the harmless melting and recycling of municipal solid waste incinerator fly ash 垃圾焚烧飞灰熔融无害化及资源化研究现状,"© 2022 Science Press. All rights reserved.In 2020, the municipal solid waste removal and transportation volume reached 235.117 million tons, of which 146.076 million tons were incinerated in China. Because it can reduce the harmfulness of waste and recycle energy, municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) technology has become the primary method for the disposal treatment of urban domestic waste in China. However, this method produces MSWI fly ash, which is defined as a hazardous waste rich in dioxins and heavy metals. Calculated based on 5% (mass fraction) of the original waste, the output of MSWI fly ash in China nearly reached 7.304 million tons in 2020. Moreover, the stockpile management and treatment capacities are seriously out of balance. At present, the main disposal method of MSWI fly ash is landfilling, which consumes land resources and poses an environmental hazard. As a result, the harmlessness and recyclability of MSWI fly ash have become a bottleneck for green development. In this review, the harmless melting and recycling of MSWI fly ash are introduced in detail. The mechanisms of heavy metal solidification and dioxin degradation during MSWI fly ash melting have been explained. MSWI fly ash can be transformed into glass slag containing CaO−SiO2−Al2O3 after co-melting with other solid wastes rich in silicon aluminum oxide. Heavy metals in MSWI fly ash can be solidified at the atomic scale in the silicate network of glass. More importantly, as the temperature increases beyond 800 °C, dioxins undergo dechlorination and degradation, reducing the harmfulness and revealing the harmlessness of MSWI fly ash. This review also describes how to deal with the glass slag that forms because of co-melting. The glass slag has low added value and poor mechanical properties. Future disposal trends for vitrified slag from MSWI fly ash, including glass–ceramic, glass–ceramic foam, and cementitious materials, have been proposed. Given that vitrification can solidify heavy metals in the process of subsequent resource usage and product service, the migration and leaching characteristics of heavy metals need to be further investigated. This study provides a reference for the comprehensive usage of MSWI fly ash.",Gongcheng Kexue Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Engineering,10.13374/j.issn2095-9389.2022.04.20.006
Monodisperse CaAl12O19:Mn4+ microspheres for full-spectrum white LEDs,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Non-rare-earth Mn4+-activated red-emitting oxide phosphors have emerged as potential alternatives of typical Eu2+ doped nitrides owing to broad-band absorption, narrow-band emission, high color purity and low cost. In this work, highly efficient CaAl12O19:Mn4+ microspheres with uniform size distributions were first prepared by combining an epoxide-driven sol-gel method with heat treatment in oxygen atmosphere. The spherical morphology is beneficial to reduce scattering of light to enhance the photoluminescence of the phosphor. This phosphor shows red emission attributed to Mn4+: 2Eg → 4A2g spin-forbidden transition in the range of 600~750 nm under excitation at 340 nm. Partitioning Mg2+ in the host was found to enhance Mn4+ luminescence because of charge balance effect and the proposed mechanisms were discussed. The luminescence quantum yield of CaAl11.7576O19:0.0024Mn4+, 0.24Mg2+ microspheres which were heat treated for 4 h at 1300 °C was measured to be 56.1%. The white LED device based on the glass ceramic containing phosphors was found to show a high-color-rendering index of 96 and a low correlated color temperature of 4522 K. The results indicate that CaAl12O19:Mn4+ microspheres have great potential for near-ultraviolet LEDs on full-spectrum lighting.

The practicability of different preparation of mandibular molar restored by modified endocrown with intracanal extension: Computational analysis using finite element models,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Background and objective: Post-core-crown (PCC) and endocrown are two common restorative methods for severely damaged molars, but exhibit disadvantages. This study aimed to explore the practicability of modified endocrown with a 2 mm intracanal extension (MED) to restore defective teeth using finite element analysis (FEA). Methods: Five groups of numerical models of mandibular molars restored by three MEDs, a PCC, and a routine endocrown after root canal treatment were devised by FEA software. We constructed 4 mm, 3 mm, and 2 mm thickness of MED restorations to restore mandibular molars that were prepared to 1 mm, 2 mm, and 3 mm from the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). Furthermore, PCC and routine endocrown were used to compare the stress distribution with MED. Lithium disilicate glass-ceramics (EMAX) and resin nanoceramics (LU) were considered restorative materials, and a vertical load of 600 N and an oblique load of 200 N were applied to the restorations. Results: In three MEDs by LU, 2 mm thickness of restoration generated the highest stress on prepared teeth, while the thickness of EMAX did not significantly influence the stress value. MED by LU generated higher stress around the CEJ, and reduced the stress on the middle and lower root compared to MEDs by EMAX, PCC by EMAX, and PCC by LU. MED by EMAX caused lower stress around the CEJ, and generated higher stress in the chamber walls after extended root canals compared with MED by LU, endocrowns by LU, and endocrowns by EMAX. There was an evident stress concentration at the last but one layer, which was a thin area of the tooth root in all restorative models. Conclusions: The use of modified endocrown may be considered an effective restorative method to restore defective mandibular molar, but suitable restorative material must be selected based on the tooth preparation method and deficiencies in the tooth structure.",Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.107178
Adhesive application after ceramic surface treatment is detrimental to load-bearing capacity under fatigue of a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdObjective: To evaluate whether an adhesive application after surface treatment on a lithium disilicate ceramic (LD) has an influence on its load-bearing capacity under fatigue. Methods: LD discs (Ø= 10 mm; thickness= 1 mm) were allocated into 8 groups (n= 15), considering 3 factors: “ceramic surface treatment” – HF: hydrofluoric acid + universal primer application; or MEP: single-component ceramic primer; “adhesive application” – with or without; and “aging protocol” – baseline: 24 h to 7 days; or aging: 180 days of storage + 25,000 thermal cycles. The LD discs were adhesively bonded to glass fiber-reinforced epoxy resin discs (Ø= 10 mm; thickness= 2 mm) and stored according to the condition and each group. Cyclic fatigue testing (initial load= 100 N; step size= 100 N until600 N and after step size= 25 N to failure; 10,000 cycles/step; 20 Hz frequency) was performed. Fractographic and adhesive interface analyzes were also performed. The collected data were then analyzed by Kaplan Meier and Mantel-Cox tests and One-way ANOVA. Results: The adhesive application in the baseline condition had no influence on the load-bearing capacity under fatigue when the HF surface treatment was performed, however, adhesive application for the MEP treatment led to worse results than without it. The adhesive application in the aged condition showed worse fatigue outcomes for both treatments. All specimens presented radial cracks. MEP treatment followed by adhesive application presented the thickest luting layer. Conclusion: The adhesive application after surface treatments of a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic is detrimental to its load-bearing capacity under fatigue when adhesively luted onto a supporting substrate.",Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105453
Effects of Streptococcus mutans and their metabolites on the wear behavior of dental restorative materials,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe wear behavior of dental restorative materials is highly related to the biolubricating medium in the oral environment. Bacteria, along with their metabolic products, are essential substances in the oral cavity and have not been studied as a potential factor affecting lubrication performance during mastication. In this study, the effects of the Streptococcus mutans bacterial cells and their metabolites were investigated on the wear behavior of resin composites, polymer-infiltrated ceramic networks and zirconium-lithium silicate glass-ceramics. A reciprocating friction test and quantitative analysis of the wear morphology were utilized to determine the coefficient of friction (COF) and wear resistance of the test materials. The results showed that the bacterial metabolite medium significantly reduces the COF and wear rate of the three restorative materials and provide better protection against superficial abrasion. When tested under lactic acid medium, a key acid production in bacterial metabolites, similar wear reduction results were observed in the three materials, which confirmed that lactic acid should be accountable for the excellent lubricating property of bacterial metabolites. Furthermore, the resin composite with lower wettability exhibited a more significant wear reduction than the other two materials when lubricating with a bacterial metabolite medium. These findings provide novel insights into the biological basis of lubrication mechanisms in the oral cavity under high-loading and low-velocity conditions.",Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105469
Net irreversible synergistic effects of environmental deterioration on fatigue and flexure properties of fiber reinforcement composite: A homogenization based model,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThis study aims to simulate net irreversible environmental deterioration and demonstrate its role in changing the residual fatigue and flexure performance in cross-ply composites. The paper develops an experimentally-validated 3D multiphysics model at structural level and gets this homogenization-based model to identify each of the degradation mechanisms observed in the experimental data and to analyze the differences that the various degradation mechanisms might make to the properties and durability of the environmental aged composite materials. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to investigate the effect of mesh density on the accuracy of functions homogenized from micromechanical models. The aging–fatigue–bend model with respect to two different deterioration mechanism assumptions is developed and analyzed. Research shows that models with homogeneous damage assumptions allow higher feasibility and convergence when aging concurrently with complicated mechanical loading, while models with surface erosion assumptions describe the real deterioration mechanism more precisely and offer more freedom, especially when the environmental aging condition is more complicated.",Composites Part B: Engineering,10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.110234
Antibacterial activity improvement of dental glass-ceramic by incorporation of AgVO3 nanoparticles,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Objective: This study aimed to investigate the role of the incorporation of an antibacterial nanoceramic (AgVO3) on the properties of a restorative dental glass-ceramic. Method: A commercially available restorative glass-ceramic, commonly designated as porcelain (IPS d.SIGN) was functionalized with an antibacterial agent (nanostructured β-AgVO3), synthesized by a hydrothermal route. Both functionalized and pristine samples were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. All samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Rietveld refinement, particle size distribution, Scanning Electron Microscopy, chemical solubility, and Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy. Their antibacterial potential (Mueller-Hinton test) was analyzed against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli). Results: The commercial glass-ceramic showed leucite (KAlSi2O6) as the only detectable crystalline phase, and, for both strains, no antibacterial activity could be detected in the Mueller-Hinton agar plates test. A monophasic, needle-shaped, and nanometric β-AgVO3 powder was successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route. After thermal treatment, glass-ceramic samples containing different percentages of β-AgVO3 showed a second crystalline phase of microline [K0.95(AlSi3O8)]. For modified samples, inhibition halos were easily visible on the Mueller-Hinton test, which ranged from 11.1 ± 0.5 mm to 16.6 ± 0.5 mm and 12.7 ± 0.3 mm to 15.5 ± 0.3 mm in the S. aureus and E.coli cultures, respectively, showing that the halos formed were dose-dependent. Also, increasing the percentage of β-AgVO3 promoted a significant increase in chemical solubility, from 72 µg/cm2 (samples with 1 wt% of β-AgVO3) to 136 µg/cm2 (samples with 2 wt% of β-AgVO3), which was associated with the silver and vanadium ions released from the glass matrix. Significance: Our in vitro results indicate that IPS d.SIGN, as most of the dental glass-ceramics, do not exhibit antibacterial activity per se. Nonetheless, in this concept test, we demonstrated that it is possible to modify dental veneering materials giving them antibacterial properties by adding at least 2 wt% of β-AgVO3, a nanomaterial easily synthesized by a simple route.",Dental Materials,10.1016/j.dental.2022.08.009
Sol–gel synthesis and characterization of lithium aluminate (L–A–H) and lithium aluminosilicate (L–A–S–H) gels,"© 2022 The Authors. International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Ceramics Society.Hydrous lithium aluminosilicate (L–A–S–H) and lithium aluminate (L–A–H) gels are candidate precursors for glass-ceramics and ceramics with potential advantages over conventional processing routes. However, their structure before calcination remained largely unknown, despite the importance of precursor structure on the properties of the resulting materials. In the present study, it is demonstrated that L–A–S–H and L–A–H gels with Li/Al ≤ 1 can be produced via an organic steric entrapment route, while higher Li/Al ratios lead to crystallization of gibbsite or nordstrandite. The composition and the structure of the gels was studied by thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, 27Al and 29Si magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, and Raman spectroscopy. Aluminium was found to be almost exclusively in six-fold coordination in both the L–A–H and the L–A–S–H gels. Silicon in the L–A–S–H gels was mainly in Q4 sites and to a lesser extent in Q3 sites (four-fold coordination with no Si–O–Al bonds). The results thus indicate that silica-rich and aluminium-rich domains formed in these gels.",International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology,10.1111/ijac.14187
Suitability and performance of NaNi1-x(VO)xPO4 mixed polyanion glass and Glass-Ceramic cathodes for Na-ion battery,"© 2022This work presents the correlation between structural stability and electrochemical impedance (EIS) performance of NaNi1-x(VO)xPO4 (x = 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mol %) mixed polyanion glass and glass–ceramic cathodes. XRD results confirm the presence of Na4Ni3(PO4)2(P2O7) (ICSD 82713), NaNi4(PO4)3 (ICSD 60964) and NaV2O5 (ICSD 1898) crystalline phases indexed with orthorhombic/Pna21 and orthorhombic/Cmcm and orthorhombic/Pmn21 structures, respectively. The inversion correlation between Rct and σb witnessed the lowest charge-transfer resistance (Rct = 7.2x103Ω) for the highest conducting NaNi0.7(VO)0.3PO4 glass–ceramic sample σb = 1.38x10-03 S/cm) using a half-cell. The best reduction potential of the Ni+4/Ni+2 ratio (2.29x10-14) by XPS for the optimally-conducting NaNi0.7(VO)0.3PO4 glass–ceramic network confirms that the present mixed polyanion glass–ceramic network exhibits relatively flexible active centres, along with its superior stability, which is responsible for achieving the excellent electrochemical performance.",Materials Science and Engineering B: Solid-State Materials for Advanced Technology,10.1016/j.mseb.2022.115938
"Biaxial flexure strength and physicochemical characterization of a CAD/CAM lithium disilicate ceramic: effect of etching time, silane, and adhesive applications","© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Objective: To evaluate the effect of different acid etching time and bonding agent (silane and/or adhesive system) on biaxial flexural strength and physico-chemical properties of a lithium disilicate ceramic. Material and methods: One hundred twenty ceramic discs were made and divided into 8 groups (n = 15) according to factors “etching time” (20 and 120 s) with hydrofluoric acid (HF) and “bonding agent” (C, no bonding agent; S, silane, A, adhesive; and SA, silane + adhesive). After surface treatment, a resin cement layer was applied to the surface and all specimens were subjected to biaxial flexural strength (BFS) test with treated surfaces loaded in tension (1 mm/min). The Weibull analyses and complementary analyses were also performed. Statistical analysis was done with 2-way ANOVA and the Tukey test (α = 0.05). Results: ANOVA revealed that the factors “etching time” (p = 0.0003) and “bonding agent” (p = 0.007) were statistically significant. In the overall analysis, the HF120S group (272.02 ± 35.30A MPa) presented significantly higher BFS than that of HF120C (218.45 ± 17.15CD MPa) and HF20S (228.40 ± 37.83BCDMPa). On the other hand, the HF20A group (208.92 ± 31.16D MPa) had significantly lower BFS than HF120S (272.02 ± 35.30A), HF120A (254.42 ± 26.87ABC) and HF120SA (259.30 ± 36.55AB) groups (Tukey). The Weibull modulus (m) of all groups was significantly different from each other (p = 0.000). Conclusions: Regardless of etching time, the application of silane alone is sufficient to increase the flexural strength of glass ceramic, eliminating the need for the application of adhesive systems. Moreover, if only silane or adhesive is applied, 120-s HF application should increase the flexural resistance of the lithium disilicate ceramic. Clinical significance. Applications of adhesive systems after silanization can be suppressed from the surface treatment protocol of glass ceramics, since it does not improve their mechanical strength.",Clinical Oral Investigations,10.1007/s00784-022-04635-2
Preparation and characterization of mesoporous amorphous nano-silica and nano-cristobalite for value enhancement of low-cost Egyptian waste materials,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Different forms of products (sodium silicate, nano-silica, and nano-cristobalite) were prepared utilizing silica fume wastes. The preparation of sodium metasilicate was achieved through the reaction of the stoichiometric ratio 1:1 of silica fume with sodium carbonate at 1000–1100 °C for an hour. Sodium metasilicate was taken as a precursor for the preparation of nano-silica. The nano-silica was obtained through the addition of sulfuric acid at 80 °C and pH = 8. The product was subjected to a freeze-drying process. The obtained powder was heat-treated at different temperatures between 500 and 1000 °C for an hour. The measured specific surface area for the powders ranged between 195.92 and 408.43 m2/g, meanwhile, the XRD revealed the formation of cristobalite at 900 and 1000 °C. The isotherms of the prepared silica showed the behavior of mesoporous materials. The production of mesoporous nano-silica from silica fume without using a template and the needed post-heated treatment to get rid of it; is considered energy-saving technology.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.07.160
Preparation and properties of ferrimagnetic glass–ceramic foams based on pyrite slag,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.By employing a melt-sintering method, we prepared a new type of ferrimagnetic glass–ceramic foam (FGCF) using ferrimagnetic glass–ceramic and foaming agent SrCO3. The ferrimagnetic glass–ceramics were fabricated based on pyrite slag by a melt-quenching method. The effects of foaming agent content, sintering temperature and time on microstructure, magnetic properties, microwave absorption performance, compressive strength, and thermal conductivity of the as-obtained FGCF were analyzed. This foaming process at 1100°C for 40 min with 3-wt% SrCO3 provided an FGCF with a bulk density of.693 g/cm3, a porosity of 63.60%, a specific saturation magnetic moment of 5.2 A m2/kg, a compressive strength of 2.61 MPa, a thermal conductivity of.241 W/(m K), and the calculated reflection loss of −12.1 dB for a layer thickness of 9 mm.",International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology,10.1111/ijac.14169
Electrical conductivity and relaxation phenomena in Li2O·B2O3 based glass and glass-ceramic: A comprehensive and comparative analysis,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThis work reports a detailed investigation on the electrical conductivity and dielectric relaxation phenomena in Li2O·B2O3 based glass and glass-ceramic materials. Measurements reveal that the electrical conductivity of glass-ceramic is lower than glass. This owes to occurrence of grain boundaries which impede the mobility of charge carriers in glass-ceramic as confirmed by FESEM micrographs. The frequency-dependent behavior of electrical conductivity, within the measured temperature range, is analysed using Jonscher's power law. It is found that the conductivity rises with an increase in temperature and the range of conductivity reveals the semiconducting behavior of the material. The ac conductivity mechanism of system is observed to follow the overlapping large polaron tunneling model. The conduction and relaxation mechanism studies are performed using electric modulus and impedance spectroscopy within the frequency and temperature ranges varied from 103 Hz to 107 Hz and 593 K–773 K, respectively. Analysis of the relaxation mechanism in both samples is performed employing Kohlrausch-William-Watts (KWW) model, which reveals that the charge carriers are following non-Debye type relaxation. To distinguish between the contribution of grain boundaries and grains in the relaxation mechanism, a combined analysis of complex electric module and impedance spectroscopy has been discussed.",Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids,10.1016/j.jpcs.2022.110911
Tm3+/Dy3+ co-doped BaO–B2O3–P2O5–Na2O glass and NaBaPO4 glass-ceramic for white LED,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, Tm3+/Dy3+ co-doped BaO–B2O3–P2O5–Na2O glass was prepared by high temperature melting method and NaBaPO4 glass-ceramics can be obtained by heat treatment of precursor glass at 580 °C for 4 h. The structures of BaO–B2O3–P2O5–Na2O glasses and NaBaPO4 glass ceramics were investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The transmission spectrum shows that the transmittances of glass and glass-ceramic at the visible light scope reach 90% and 80%, respectively. The photoluminescence performance, energy transfer progress and luminescence mechanism were investigated simultaneously. The emitting color can be adjusted through the concentrations of Dy3+ and Tm3+ ions. Under the excitation of 354 nm ultraviolet light, the color temperature (5610.7K) and color coordinate (0.3303, 0.3077) of the glass, and color temperature 5563.8K, color coordinate (0.3311, 0.3111) of the NaBaPO4 glass-ceramic, which is close to the standard white light (5454.12 K, (0.3333, 0.3333)), can be achieved. The luminous intensity of glass-ceramic is much higher than that of precursor glass. The above result shows that Tm3+/Dy3+ co-doped BaO–B2O3–P2O5–Na2O glass and NaBaPO4 glass ceramics have latent application value in the territory of white LED and light-emitting display.",Optical Materials,10.1016/j.optmat.2022.112862
Innovative glass-ceramic foams prepared by alkali activation and reactive sintering of clay containing zeolite (zeolite-poor rock) and sawdust for thermal insulation,"© 2022 The AuthorsEnergy-saving through thermal insulation of the buildings is becoming extremely important recently, addressing sustainability-connected challenges. This work examines the potential for producing innovative glass-ceramic foams from zeolite-poor rock and sawdust using alkali activation and reactive sintering techniques. A comprehensive analysis has been conducted for the detailed characterization of raw materials as well as the produced samples. The starting raw materials and the produced samples were investigated based on their chemical constituents, particle size distribution, BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), thermogravimetric (TG), differential thermal analysis (DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and computed tomography (CT). The alkali activation and the mechanism of foaming were systematically discussed. The optimal sintering temperature and the maximum expansion percentage are evaluated using heating microscopy. The findings show that the used alkali-activated raw mixtures have excellent foamability at 850–950 °C. The influence of the sawdust content and sintering temperatures on different technical characteristics such as bulk density, volume expansion, compressive strength, thermal conductivity, morphologies, phase identification, and microstructural properties of the sintered samples were thoroughly examined. The SEM and CT analysis of the produced specimens reveals the formation of foams with different types of pore sizes and distribution. The produced glass-ceramic foams have compressive strengths ranging from 0.3 to 4.5 MPa and thermal conductivities ranging from 0.058 to 0.178 W/mK. Development of these value-added glass-ceramic foams utilizing easily obtainable, low price raw materials should result in economically cost-effective materials with extra environmental benefits.",Journal of Building Engineering,10.1016/j.jobe.2022.105160
Identification of diffusion properties of composites materials for aircraft applications,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe paper deals with the identification of planar anisotropic diffusion properties of carbon-epoxy composite materials for aircraft applications, based on the exploitation of short-time gravimetric tests. The method consists in performing short time gravimetric tests on composites samples and measuring the initial slope of their mass uptake curve with respect to t. The identification is performed by minimizing the sum of squared residuals, the residual being the difference between the measured slope and the analytical slope. The identification protocol allows determining the 2 coefficients of diffusion along the principal directions of orthotropy and the orientation of the orthotropic frame reference with respect to the sample frame.

Effect of Nd2O3 dosages and melting temperatures on pyrochlore borosilicate glass-ceramics immobilization,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.In this study, borosilicate glass-ceramic waste forms containing pyrochlore crystalline phase (PBGC) were prepared by one-step heat-treated method. The effect of Nd2O3 dosages and melting temperatures on the crystalline phases and microstructure of PBGC were studied by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Product Consistency Test (PCT) was used to investigate the aqueous durability of PBGC. The 14 wt% Nd2O3 doping in PBGC contributes to the formation of pyrochlore (Ca,Na)(Nb,Ti)2Nd0.67O6F. The optimal supercooling region of the glass-ceramic is from the melting temperature of 1325 °C to the initial cooling temperature of 1000 °C. The prepared glass-ceramic has a stable pyrochlore crystalline structure. In addition, the normalized leaching rates of major elements in PBGC are comparable to those of standard reference glass for immobilization of high-level wastes (HLWs). The results of this study provide useful guidance on the immobilization of certain HLWs in the industry using glass-ceramic materials.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.07.150
Effect of [SiO2]/[Li2O] on the microstructure and properties of lithium disilicate glass-ceramics containing lithium tantalate as a secondary phase,"© 2022Our previous work proposed a phase reaction equation for the current lithium disilicate (LD) glass-ceramic system containing lithium tantalate (LT) as a secondary phase: 2(Li2SiO3) + Ta2O5 → Li2Si2O5 + 2(LiTaO3). The present study had a goal of finding support for the proposed equation by examining the effect of the ratio of [SiO2] to [Li2O] on the phase assemblage and microstructure of this system. The study also examined the microstructural effects on several properties of this system. A 15-sample data set was created by designing three microstructures for each of the five compositions. It was found that the LT/LD ratio from X-ray diffraction peak counts, as well as from Rietveld refinement, increased in the material as [SiO2]/[Li2O] decreased, supporting the proposed reaction equation. As [SiO2]/[Li2O] decreased, bulk density and CTE increased, while L* (lightness vs darkness) and Knoop hardness values decreased. The microstructure had little effect on radiopacity, but the addition of extra Ta2O5 into the composition lead to increased radiopacity values.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121834

Kinetics of crack healing and self-repair behaviors in a sealant glass for SOFC applications,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.A sealant is required for the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) to maintain hermeticity at high operating temperatures, keep fuel and oxidant from mixing, and avoid shorting of the cell stack. Glass and glass–ceramic materials are widely used as a sealant because their properties can be tailored to meet the stringent requirements of SOFC stack, but they are susceptible to cracking. In contrast, a promising concept of self-repairable glass for seals is pursued for making reliable seals that can self-repair cracks at the SOFC operating temperatures. This concept is studied through measuring crack-healing kinetics and independent measurement of glass viscosity for relating to the observed self-repair. The cracks on the glass surface are created using a Vickers indenter to achieve a well-defined crack geometry, and then the glass is exposed to elevated temperatures for different length of times to study the crack-healing kinetics. The crack-healing kinetics is compared with the predictions of our theoretical model and found to be in good agreement. In addition, glass viscosity is extracted from the healing kinetics and compared with the independent measurement of viscosity measured from the dilatometry and sintering data to further validate the crack-healing theoretical model. These results are presented and discussed.",International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology,10.1111/ijac.14143
Bioactive antibacterial borate glass and glass-ceramics,"© 2022This work aimed to study bioactive glass-ceramics obtained by controlled crystallization, as a function of the heat treatment time, in system 59.5B2O3-2P2O5-9.5CaO-19.5Na2O-9CaF2-0.5Ag2O (mol %). The samples were prepared by the melt-quench method, and thermally treated at 530 °C, with different times: 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36 h. Results of DTA, XRD, FTIR, density and molar volume are shown. The results of XRD revealed the development of crystalline phases during the heat treatment (CaNaB5O9, Ca3(PO4)2, Na2B6O10 and Ag°). The percentage of crystallization and in the size of the crystallite show increases with the time of the heat treatment, as expected. In vitro bioactivity of the samples was analyzed by immersion in SBF for 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. XRD patterns and FTIR spectra after immersion proved HA precipitation. The pH results reveal a higher ion exchange rate for the crystallized samples. This can be associated with the microstructure changes that occur on the surface of the samples during the heat treatment and the solubility of the crystalline phases. In addition, glass and crystallized samples showed antibacterial action against E. coli, independently of the crystallization time. It is possible to conclude that glass-ceramics can potentially be used as biomaterials in the treatment of bone fractures.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121829
Reproducible X-ray excited luminescence performance with transparent Tb3+-doped NaGd2F7 scintillating glass ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdOxyfluoride glass ceramics with low toxicity, high stability and strong X-ray excited luminescence intensity are introduced as scintillating material. Herein, a series of novel NaGd2F7:xTb3+ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) were synthesized through in situ growth self-crystallization. X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectrometer and transmission electron microscopy were measured to investigate the structure and morphology of NaGd2F7 glass ceramics. These investigations demonstrate that NaGd2F7 nanocrystals are uniformly distributed in glass matrix with 20–30 nm diameter. Photoluminescence and X-ray excitation spectra are greatly enhanced after further thermal treatment which verify better crystallization of NaGd2F7 glass ceramics. The X-ray excited luminescence of the GC2–640 sample can reach 143.8% of the commercial BGO. More importantly, the damaged material can be completely repaired by annealing at 350 °C for 30 min.

Fracture behavior of lightweight mullite-SiC refractories with porous aggregates coated with glass ceramic,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Owing to the periodic mechanical stresses frequently suffered by refractories applied in cement rotary kilns, the study of fracture behavior is particularly significant for long life, safety, and reliable operation. In this work, bauxite aggregates and lightweight mullite aggregates with and without glass ceramic coatings were utilized in mullite-SiC refractories, and the fracture properties of the refractories were investigated and compared using the Brazilian test, digital image correlation technology, crack propagation path analysis, etc. The results show that the application of a glass ceramic coating on the surface of lightweight aggregates strengthens the interface between the porous mullite aggregates and the matrix, not only improving the compressive and tensile strength of the material but also increasing the number of crack branches and further improving fracture toughness. The compressive strength, tensile strength, and tensile displacement of refractories with 50 vol% coated lightweight aggregate increased by 53.1%, 67.6%, and 42.3%, respectively, compared to traditional mullite-SiC refractories.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.07.169
Wear behavior and abrasiveness of monolithic CAD/CAM ceramics after simulated mastication,"© 2022, The Author(s).Objectives: To evaluate the wear resistance and abrasiveness of monolithic CAD/CAM ceramics. Materials and methods: Rectangular-shaped specimens (12 mm × 6.5 mm × 1.5 mm) were sectioned from the following CAD/CAM blocks (n = 10); partially crystallized lithium disilicate (PLD), experimental fully crystallized lithium disilicate (FLD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS), super-translucent monolithic zirconia (SMZ), and ultra-translucent monolithic zirconia (UMZ). Silicon carbide papers were used to mechanically flatten and polish the surfaces. PLD specimens were subjected to a combined crystallization/glazing firing cycle. Ceramic specimens were mounted to the wear device and tested for 200,000 cycles against human premolars at 20 N force and 2 mm sliding distance. Artificial saliva was used as a lubricant. The teeth were scanned using micro-CT before and after the wear test and the generated models were overlapped to determine the volumetric tooth loss. Before and after the test, specimens’ weights and surface roughness (Ra) values were measured, and the differences were calculated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were utilized for microstructural and chemical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA or an equivalent test for non-parametric results. Significance level was set at P ≤ 0.05. Results: The type of ceramic material affected the ceramic and antagonist wear rates (P < 0.001). PLD and ZLS had the highest ceramic and antagonist wear, whereas UMZ and SMZ demonstrated the lowest wear values. The FLD group showed comparable antagonist wear and significantly less ceramic wear than PLD and ZLS. Conclusions: Monolithic zirconia demonstrated the best wear resistance and least abrasiveness to the antagonist. The experimental lithium disilicate was more wear-resistant than other glass–ceramic groups. Clinical relevance: Monolithic zirconia is wear-resistant and gentle on the antagonist. In contrast, glass–ceramics are more abrasive to enamel.",Clinical Oral Investigations,10.1007/s00784-022-04611-w
Effect of particle size distribution on crystallization behavior of glass-based seals in reversible solid oxide cells,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.Reversible solid oxide cell (RSOC), integrating solid oxide fuel cell and solid oxide electrolysis cell, usually utilizes a glass material as seals. The particle size distribution of glass has a significant influence on crystallization and sintering behavior in the sealing process during RSOC operation. In this work, the effects of particle size on the non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of BaO–ZnO–MgO–B2O3–SiO2 glass in RSOC are conducted. The crystallization behavior of glass is experimentally investigated and theoretically analyzed using Kissinger, Augis–Bennett, and Ozawa models. The values of crystallization activation energies are 164.4, 188.4, and 223.2 kJ/mol for 50, 150, and 300 μm (average particle sizes of S1, S2, and S3 glasses, respectively). The Avrami parameter (n) and dimensionality (m) of S1 glass are 0.6 and 0.7, similarly those of S2 glass were 0.9 and 0.7, corresponding to surface crystallization. However, the n and m values of S3 glass are both 1.8, suggesting that crystal growth between 1 (rod like) and 2 (plate like). Coarse glass exhibits better thermal stability and higher sluggishness to crystallize than that of fine glass. The main crystallization phases are characterized as thermally stable structure BaZn2Si2O7. Combined crystallization behavior with sintering behavior of glass, it is indicated that fine glass owns fast crystallization kinetics compared with sintering kinetics, generating a porous structure, whereas glass with larger particles crystallizes more slowly, exhibiting a relatively dense structure in RSOC operation.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/jace.18608
Cold crystallization kinetics of slag from the joint smelting of oxidized nickel and sulfide copper ores,"© 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.The cold crystallization kinetics of the glass-crystal composition (90.3 vol% of glass) made of slag from the joint smelting of oxidized nickel and sulfide copper ores were studied in the temperature range from 876 to 1003 °C with a heating rate of 5–20 °C·min–1 in an inert atmosphere (the elemental composition of slag is mass%: 0.09 Ni, 0.12 Cu, 0.02 Co, 0.2 Zn, 15.7 Fe, 0.2 S, 50.0 SiO2, 14.2 MgO, 4.8 Al2O3, and 9.4 CaO; particle size < 0.125 mm). XRD data showed that, depending on heating rate, different combinations of crystalline phases could be released in the glass matrix, such as cummingtonite, SiO2 polymorphs, epistilbite, rankinite, wadsleyite, merwinite, and alite. The glass content has been reduced to 54.2 mass% during cold crystallization. The cold crystallization kinetic parameters were estimated by treating the non-isothermal DSC data by Kissinger (classical and advanced), Ozawa, and Augis–Bennett methods. The apparent activation energy, Avrami exponent, and dimensionality of crystal growth are found to be 659 kJ·mol–1, 2.8, and 1.8, respectively. The process is dominated by bulk nucleation with an increase in the number of nuclei under conditions of combined two- and one-dimensional crystal growth. During cold crystallization, 1.3 times more volume of crystals are found to release than when the melted slag is cooled, and there is no need for fine grinding of the raw material. Annealing of granular slag could be a more efficient method of producing glass–ceramics based on the FeOx–CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 system than the petrurgic method.",Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry,10.1007/s10973-022-11429-x
"Influence of Bi2O3 content on structural, optical and radiation shielding properties of transparent Bi2O3-Na2O-TiO2-ZnO-TeO2 glass ceramics","© 2022 Elsevier LtdThis study aimed to evaluate the thermal, structural, optical and radiation shielding properties of the xBi2O3–5Na2O–5TiO2–10ZnO-(80-x)TeO2 glass ceramics, where x = 5, 8, 10, 12, and 15 mol% using the conventional melt quenching technique while controlled the heat treatment. The thermal properties of the sample glasses, such as glass transition temperature, onset crystallization temperature, and glass stability, were estimated from the differential scanning calorimetry measurements. The glass stability was found to decrease as Bi2O3 content increased. The tendency of crystallization was also found to increase correspondingly which evidenced by the sample glass with a higher percentage of Bi2O3 content has crystallized in a shorter period of heat treatment, lost transparency, and forming multiple crystalline phases correspondingly as shown in the XRD results. The optical band gap decreased as the period of controlled heat treatment prolonged. A low energy band gap indicates the high polarizability of the sample glass due to the high polarizability of non-bridging oxygen. The material discussed here has high relevance to laser, non-linear optics, and optical communication applications. The physical and ionizing shielding features were investigated for current glass samples. The shielding properties were examined within the energy range of 0.015 until 15 MeV. The sample S5 has the optimum shielding features as a result of the addition of Bi2O3. Hence, the composition attributes a new glass system that can be used in various applications such as optical communication applications, radiation dosimeter and photon shielding materials.",Radiation Physics and Chemistry,10.1016/j.radphyschem.2022.110289
Chemical Strengthening of Li2O-ZrO2-SiO2 (LZS) and Li2O-ZrO2-SiO2-Al2O3 (LZSA) Sintered Glass-Ceramics,"© 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.Ion exchange is a chemical method to increase the mechanical strength on the surface of glass-based materials, in which an exchange between an alkaline ion with smaller radius (from glass) and an alkaline ion with larger radius (from molten salt) is promoted. This creates a superficial compression layer, resulting in mechanical strengthening, compensating the cracks created during processing and use of those glass-based materials. In this context, lithium-based sintered glass-ceramics belonging to the Li2O-ZrO2-SiO2 (LZS) and Li2O-ZrO2-SiO2-Al2O3 (LZSA) systems were summited to ion exchange in a NaNO3 salt bath. The temperatures used in these processes varied from 430°C to 500°C, with immersion times from 15 min to 3 h. After the thermal chemical processes, the LZS glass-ceramics presented a sodium content from 0.20 wt.% to 3.11 wt.%, layer depth up to 2500 µm, and mechanical strength increase up to 19.6%. For the LZSA glass-ceramics, the sodium content varied from 0.23 wt.% to 1.03 wt.% and a layer depth up to 2300 µm was obtained, with a 30.4% mechanical strength decrease. For both glass-ceramics systems, a diffusion coefficient in the order of 10−5 cm2/s and a Weibull modulus increase were demonstrated. For comparison, the results of previous research work, in which ion exchange using a NaNO3 salt paste method, are also related.",JOM,10.1007/s11837-022-05340-x
"Modification of curing, morphological, mechanical and electrical properties of epoxidised natural rubber (ENR-25) through the addition of copper calcium titanium oxide (CCTO)","© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The limited applicability of very high dielectric permittivity ceramic materials such as copper calcium titanium oxide, commonly known as CCTO (εr = 100,000 at room temperature and nearly independent of frequency from 1 Hz to 1 MHz), could be improved through the fabrication of polymer matrix composites. Ceramic is brittle while polymers are materials that are ductile and have excellent flexibility but low εr. Another contrast between the two materials is the fabrication process where ceramic, specifically, requires pressing and a high sintering temperature. Hence, the right combination of ceramic and polymeric materials should theoretically produce a composite with excellent mechanical and electrical properties. Therefore, a study on CCTO ceramic powder blended with 25 mol% of epoxidised natural rubber (ENR-25) was carried out. The CCTO powder was initially synthesised through solid-state reaction followed by compounding with ENR-25 formulations with different CCTO loadings (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 phr) in an internal mixer. Small blocks of the composite were cast into ~ 2 mm of mould thickness and then hot compressed into square shapes. Samples were characterised by curing, mechanical, electrical, and microstructural properties. As a result, the addition of CCTO was found to have lowered the curing time, i.e. tc90 at 20 phr, compared to composites without CCTO loading. Then, the curing time gradually increased with filler loading from 2.05 to 2.48 at 20 to 120 phr loading, respectively. Mechanical testing of the composites showed an increase in tensile strength from 5.91 to 16.46 MPa. However, with content higher than 40 phr content, the tensile strength's magnitude gradually decreased with increasing filler loading from 13.63 to 6.49 MPa. In comparison, hardness properties increased with an increase of filler loading from 30.5 to 44.7 Shore A. Meanwhile, LCR meter showed that increased CCTO content could improve εr value from 6.134 to 12.114 at 75 kHz and decrease the dielectric loss (tan δ) from 0.179 to 0.150 at 2 MHz. The composite's microstructure also shows CCTO crystals embedded in the ENR-25 with excellent surface contact. The surface morphology showed that samples with filler content of 60 phr onwards had a lot of CCTO particle pore agglomeration, which reduced its mechanical strength from 16.46 to 6.49 MPa.",Polymer Bulletin,10.1007/s00289-021-03995-1
Effect of sintering temperature and binder addition on the properties of cupola slag glass–ceramic tiles,"© 2021, Islamic Azad University (IAU).The present study aims to investigate the characteristics of cupola furnace slag and to explore its compatibility for the production of ceramic tiles. The glass–ceramic tiles were prepared via a simple powder metallurgy method. The major constituents of the powdered slag are SiO2 and CaO. During thermal processing, CaO-based complex oxides such as wollastonite and anorthite were formed, which was found to be influential in improving the mechanical properties of the glass–ceramics. Significant improvement in the mechanical and thermal properties was obtained by the addition of 2 wt% phosphate binders in the sample. Crystallization of the glassy phases initiated when the sample sintered above 900 °C. Sintering above 1100 °C caused formation of micro-cracks in the matrix. The characteristics of the prepared tiles were compared with the International standards for semi-vitreous floor tiles (ISO 13006-B2a). The results indicate that cupola furnace slag may successfully be used for the manufacturing of ceramic tiles.",International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology,10.1007/s13762-021-03755-8
Enhanced infrared luminescence of multifunctional-nanoparticle-composited transparent solids,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Amorphous transparent solid glass doped with functional nanoparticles may have considerable potential in military and civilian fields, for the exploration of highly efficient laser materials. Secondary melting technology and spontaneous precipitation of precious metals were employed to prepare dual-phase nanocrystalline glass ceramics containing Ag nanoparticles and Gd2O3:Er, and the prepared ceramics exhibited high optical transmittance. The microscopic morphologies and possible structural changes of the embedded nanoparticles were confirmed by using Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Based on the results of the fluorescence spectra and lifetime, the source and possible causes of luminescence enhancement were explained. The crystal environment of Gd2O3 and the characteristics of Ag nanoparticles resulted in a substantial increase in infrared emission, indicating that this composite is expected to be a potentially efficient laser gain material.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154107
3D Printing of Aramid Nanofiber Composites by Stereolithography,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Vat photopolymerization is a versatile 3D-printing method that produces parts using polymeric materials with uniform mechanical properties, high-quality surface finish, and high-resolution features. However, it is challenging to make composite materials with vat photopolymerization mainly because of the imperfect filler dispersion in the photoresin. Herein, we describe a methodology to incorporate aramid nanofibers (ANFs) into a 3D-printable photoresin as a dispersion, followed by a solvent-exchange process that limits anisotropic shrinkage and cracking of the printed polymer. By incorporating 0.60 wt % ANFs, both the tensile strength and toughness increased by 264% and 219%, respectively, while Young's modulus had a 406% increase compared to the control photoresin.",ACS Applied Nano Materials,10.1021/acsanm.1c03843
Cure-dependent loading rate effects on strength and stiffness of particle-reinforced thermoset polymers,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThermoset polymers are widely used in the civil engineering field, especially as adhesives, coatings, and matrices for composite materials. During the in-situ application of these materials, thermal activation is typically not possible, resulting in an undefined curing state of the system, which depends on the reaction kinetics and ambient conditions. These resins can also react at low temperatures; however, a certain amount of time is needed to reach a fully cured state. This characteristic complicates the assessment of the mechanical properties and the prediction of long-term behavior. In this work, primarily the loading rate effect on strength is analyzed for different curing states, which are derived from relevant in-situ conditions while also the effect of stiffness is discussed. The degrees of cure have been assessed by means of DSC measurements after submitting the samples to specific curing and post-curing protocols. Two products, one epoxy-based and one vinyl ester-based, have been studied. The tensile strength of these materials was characterized at various loading rates, monitoring the strain using digital image correlation (DIC). The results reveal that the loading rate effect on strength and stiffness strongly depends on the polymer's curing degree. Finally, simplified models able to describe the dependencies between the degree of cure of the thermosets and the rate effects on strength and stiffness are proposed as an essential element for realistic numerical simulations of incompletely cured thermosets in real world applications.",Polymer,10.1016/j.polymer.2022.125326
A lanthanide-doped glass-ceramic fiber for stress sensing,"© 2022 The AuthorsStress sensors that can recognize the location where a force is applied and propagate strain information are desirable for future integrated intelligent devices. However, developing sensors free from electromagnetic interference and complicated detector setups is challenging. Here, a self-driven optical fiber is developed and implemented as a remote stress sensor. Terbium-doped fluoride nanocrystals (Ba2LaF7: Tb3+) are precipitated in situ from a transparent glass and have notable mechanoluminescence (ML) because of designed defect traps. We propose that the encapsulated nature of the nanocrystals (NCs) within the amorphous matrix facilitates efficient energy transfer from traps to emission centers, which is critical for achieving the ML behavior. The optical waveguide effect of the as-developed transparent ML sensor facilitates capture and transmission of the signals. The explored self-driven glass ceramic fiber opens a door for detecting and recording mechanical information within integrated devices.",Cell Reports Physical Science,10.1016/j.xcrp.2022.101093
High-temperature mass spectrometric study of thermodynamic properties in the TiO2–Al2O3–SiO2 system and modeling,"© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Rationale: The TiO2–Al2O3–SiO2 system is the base for various glass–ceramic materials, which have great practical value for a large number of modern technologies. Many TiO2–Al2O3–SiO2 materials are synthesized or applied at high temperatures, which justifies the relevance of the present study. Methods: The samples in the TiO2–Al2O3–SiO2 system were synthesized using the method of induction melting in a cold crucible. The thermodynamic properties of the TiO2–Al2O3–SiO2 system were studied using the Knudsen effusion mass spectrometric method. The derived thermodynamic functions were optimized within the generalized lattice theory of associated solutions (GLTAS) approach and compared with the results of calculation using the semiempirical Kohler, Muggianu, Toop, Redlich–Kister, and Wilson methods based on the corresponding data in the binary systems. Results: The SiO2 selective vaporization from the samples under study was shown at temperatures above 1940 K. The thermodynamic properties in the TiO2–Al2O3–SiO2 system, including the TiO2–SiO2 system, were obtained in the temperature range 1965–2012 K and were optimized using GLTAS to obtain the consistent concentration dependences of the component activities and excess Gibbs energies. Conclusions: Positive deviations from the ideal behavior were observed in the TiO2–Al2O3–SiO2 system at high temperatures. Comparison of these values with the results of the modeling based on the GLTAS approach allowed the recommendations regarding the optimal semiempirical methods for the excess Gibbs energy calculation in different concentration ranges to be made.",Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry,10.1002/rcm.9359
An interactive water lubrication mechanism of γ-LiAlSi2O6 glass-ceramics in friction and wear,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Anti-attrition and water lubrication are two areas where ceramics are widely applied. In comparison to pure ceramics, glass-ceramic composite materials are more accessible to machine and manufacture into water lubrication kits. However, current water lubrication theories are mainly applied to ceramic materials such as SiC, Si3N4, Al2O3 and ZrO2. Glass-ceramic water lubrication mechanisms are not involved, in particular, the specific development process of low friction glass-ceramics in the water environment is yet unknown, which limits the application of glass-ceramics. As a result, we developed custom-made γ-LiAlSi2O6 glass-ceramics for a ball and a wafer that were utilized to conduct friction and wear tests. By contrasting the dry and wet friction coefficients between the ball and the wafer, abrasion losses and surface roughnesses of glass-ceramics, particle size distribution and zeta potential of wear debris over time, the water lubrication mechanisms of glass-ceramics in three different friction stages were clarified, the interactive lubrication effects of the electrical double layer and the dynamic fluid pressure ensure that the wet friction coefficient of the glass-ceramics is constant below 0.02.",Wear,10.1016/j.wear.2022.204440
Thermal and fluorescence properties of Nd2O3-doped Gd2O3-Ga2O3-GeO2 glass based on the Judd-Ofelt theory,"© 2022A novel type of xNd2O3-doped 14.75Gd2O3-23.33Ga2O3-(61.92-x)GeO2 glasses were successfully prepared. The thermal stability of the glass was studied by DSC and the forming ability of the glass was analyzed by XRD. Based on Judd-Ofelt theory, the strength parameters (Ω = 2, 4, 6) and radiation characteristics of the glass were analyzed detailedly by absorption and emission spectra. The results show that when the doping Nd2O3 is 1 mol%, the glasses not only have more stable thermal properties, but also have the best emission spectral intensity at 4F3/2→4I11/2 (1060 nm) with excellent radiative transition probability and stimulated emission cross section (σemis). Furthermore, it is found that the luminescence intensity of the glass ceramics obtained after heat treatment was increased by about 4.5 times due to the formation of GdGaGe2O7 crystal phase. In conclusion, the novel Nd2O3-doped Gd2O3-Ga2O3-GeO2 glass has the potential as a high power laser (1.06 μm) application material.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121810
Novel Sm3+ doped BaZn2(PO4)2 glass-ceramic for optically stimulated luminescence dosimetry,"© 2022Sm3+ doped glass-ceramic with crystallized BaZn2(PO4)2 was prepared and its structural, optical, and stimulated luminescence dosimetry properties were investigated. The excitation and emission spectra of photoluminescence exhibit Sm3+ associated transitions. The relationship between the doping concentration and the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) intensity was investigated. The OSL intensity reached a maximum at a Sm3+ concentration of 0.25 mol%, after that, a concentration quenching was observed. The OSL decay curves of BaZn2(PO4)2: 0.25Sm3+ glass-ceramic are deconvoluted by using general order kinetics show the two components that contribute to the OSL signal with photoionization cross sections of 1.693 × 10−17 and 2.443 × 10−18 cm2, respectively. The thermoluminescence curve has two peaks at 393 and 477 K. The linear radiation dose response range is identified as 0.2-500 Gy. These results show that Sm3+ doped BaZn2(PO4)2 glass-ceramic has the potential to be used as a candidate material for radiation dosimetry.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121796
Tailoring Li2Si2O5 rod-like particles and their simultaneously strengthening and toughening effects on lithium disilicate glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.To achieve high performance of glass-ceramics, it is urgent to open a new path to enhance the mechanical properties. In this study, Li2Si2O5 rods were successfully synthesized by a modified two-step solid-state reaction sintering method. The rod aspect ratio could be controlled by adjusting the second stage sintering time. The evolution process of such Li2Si2O5 rods and their possible formation mechanism were put forward. For the first time, the Li2Si2O5 rods were used to strengthen and toughen the homologous Li2Si2O5 glass-ceramic in a typical quaternary Li2O-SiO2-K2O-La2O3 system, which indicates a high flexural strength and toughness of 315±24 MPa and 2.42±0.6 MPa·m1/2, respectively. In this glass-ceramic, the microstructure features a densely stagger network formed by the elongated rods and smaller Li2Si2O5 crystals in the glass matrix, contributing to the improvement of mechanical properties. The results demonstrate that Li2Si2O5 rods could be an excellent candidate for strengthening and toughening glass-ceramics.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121794
Quaternary bioactive glass-derived powders presenting submicrometric particles and antimicrobial activity,"© 2022The biomedical engineering advances in the last years have been rising demand for multifunctional biomaterials. Bioactive glass (BG) submicron particles are potential candidates for the formulation of composites with improved dispersion and homogeneity between the constituents. This work presents the preparation of SiO2–Na2O–CaO–P2O5 glass-derived powders composed of particles with homogenous shapes and sizes between 300 and 500 nm. Two types of synthesis were employed for the preparation of the BG powders, the melt-quenching method, and a citric acid-assisted sol-gel route at a low citric acid concentration (0.005 mol L−1). The morphology of the particles was achieved by a low-energy process using a ball mill. These powders were characterized for their structure and surface area and evaluated for in vitro mineralization and antibacterial behavior. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed different crystalline silicate phases in the sol-gel-derived powder and confirmed the amorphous structure of the melt-quenching-derived one. The surface of the particles was covered by hydroxycarbonate-apatite (HCA) after five days in simulated body fluid (SBF). The antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus was higher for the sol-gel-derived powder, showing inhibition >99% of the bacteria growth in 24 h for all concentrations studied. These BG-based powders present a set of characteristics useful for the formulation of multifunctional composites for orthopedic applications.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.266
Effects of glass-ceramic spray deposition manipulation on the surface characteristics of zirconia dental restorations,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.A novel glass-ceramic spray deposition (GCSD) method was developed to modify the yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP) surface and to enhance the bond strength between Y-TZP and resin cement. Five different experimental groups were characterized, non-treatment (NT), airborne particle abrasion (AB), GCSD without etching (GS), GCSD with 5% HF etching (GSE5), and GCSD with 9.5% HF etching (GSE9), to determine the optimal method for improving the bond strength. Scanning electron microscopy and an argon ion milling system were used to investigate the surface and cross-sectional microstructures. The changes in the surface characteristics of Y-TZP were analyzed via contact angle analysis, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry. The bond strengths were determined using shear bond strength test. The results revealed that GCSD could produce a dense and uniform lithium disilicate glass-ceramic coating layer and infiltrate the Y-TZP surface. This coating resulted in superior micromechanical interlocking and increased hydrophilicity, thereby enhancing the bond strength between Y-TZP and resin cement (P < 0.05). The study findings indicated that GCSD accompanied by 5% HF etching for 100 s is optimal for strengthening the Y-TZP/resin cement bond, thereby providing a novel solution for dental bonding systems.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.252
"Crystallization temperature dependence of structure, electrical and energy storage properties in BaO–Na2O–Nb2O5–Al2O3–B2O3 glass ceramics","© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.For dielectric capacitors, high energy density and discharge power density are crucial for utilisation in pulsed power devices. In this paper, BaO–Na2O–Nb2O5–Al2O3–B2O3 (BNN-AB) glass ceramics were successfully fabricated by melt quenching and heat treatment techniques. With increasing crystallization temperature, both the dielectric permittivity and breakdown strength (BDS) first increased and then decreased. When the crystallization temperature was lower than 800 °C, the principal crystalline phase was Ba2NaNb5O15 and the secondary phase was NaNbO3. When crystallization temperature was increased from 800 °C to 830 °C, a small amount of a third phase (Al4B2O9) appeared. At the crystallization temperature of 770 °C, the compact glass ceramics with a fine grain structure had the highest permittivity (∼216 @ 25 °C) and high BDS (∼1170 kV/cm). A single-layer capacitor made of glass ceramics had a high power density (∼414 MW/cm3) and discharge energy density (∼1.93 J/cm3), measured by the charge-discharge test platform under the applied field strength of 500 kV/cm. The discharge energy density of glass ceramics sample was as much as 7.7 times that of the mother glass. The above evidences indicate that BNN-AB glass ceramic materials have broad application prospects in the field of dielectric energy storage.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.07.011
Removal of uranium by APG/TAS antifreeze foam detergent with high foaming property,"© 2022The environmentally friendly antifreeze foam detergent was synthesized from the biomass-based surfactants alkyl polyglucoside (APG), tea saponin (TAS), waterborne polyurethane (WPU), tartaric acid (TA), and sodium chloride (NaCl) in order to remove radioactive contamination on the surface of nuclear emergency and decommissioning facilities in low temperature environment. Additionally, the composition of foam detergent was optimized by response surface methodology. The foaming, stability, wall-hanging property of antifreeze foam detergent and its decontamination properties of simulated radioactive pollution under low temperature environment were studied. The surface tension, viscosity, and wettability of antifreeze foam detergent and the decontamination mechanism at low temperature were analyzed. The results show that at the low temperature of − 10 ºC, the foaming multiple of the foam detergent is 14.37, the half-life is 44.43 min, and the wall-hanging time on the surface of vertical ceramic tile is 60 min. Within 30 min, the decontamination factors of simulated radioactive contamination on the surface of the glass, ceramic tile, stainless steel, and lacquered board by antifreeze foam detergent are 17.83, 12.82, 12.03, and 14.83, respectively. Environmentally friendly antifreeze foam detergent with high foaming property, outstanding wall-hanging property, and decontamination ability has broad application prospects in nuclear emergency and decommissioning of nuclear facilities in low temperature environments in winter.",Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects,10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.129589
"A Review on Photocatalytic Glass Ceramics: Fundamentals, Preparation, Performance Enhancement and Future Development","© 2022 by the authors.Photocatalytic technology is considered as one of the most attractive and promising technologies to directly harvest, convert and store renewable solar energy for generating sustainable and green energy and a broad range of environmental applications. However, the use of a photocatalyst in powder or coating forms restricts its applications due to its disadvantages, such as difficulty in recovery of nano-powder, secondary pollution, low adhesion between photocatalytic coating and substrate material, short service life of photocatalytic film and so on. The investigation and application of photocatalytic glass-ceramics (PGCs) in water purification, bacterial disinfection, self-cleaning and hydrogen evolution have received extensive attention due to their inherent advantages of low cost, easy fabrication, transparency, chemical and mechanical stability. Real-time solutions to energy shortage and environmental pollution faced by the development of human society can be provided by rationally designing the chemical composition and preparation methods of glass ceramics (GCs). This review introduces the concept and crystallization mechanism of PGCs and expounds on the basic mechanism of photocatalysis. Then, the key point difficulties of GCs’ design are discussed, mainly including the methods of obtaining transparency and controlling crystallization technologies. Different modification strategies to achieve better photocatalytic activity are highlighted. Finally, we look forward to further in-depth exploration and research on more efficient PGCs suitable for various applications.",Catalysts,10.3390/catal12101235
Effect of Different Etching Times with Hydrofluoric Acid on the Bond Strength of CAD/CAM Ceramic Material,"© 2022 by the authors.The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of hydrofluoric acid (HF) and conditioning time on the micro-shear bond strength (µSBS) between dual-cure resin cement and glass-ceramic materials, such as lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) (EX) and leucite-reinforced ceramic (IPS Empress CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) (EP), and also a hybrid ceramic (Vita Enamic, Vita Zahnfabrik) (VE). Eighteen sections with 1 mm thickness were cut from each CAD/CAM material and randomly divided into three groups, according to the surface etching time (30 s, 60 s, 90 s). The surface treatment was performed using 9.5% HF acid gel, then resin cement was applied on the prepared ceramic plates and light cured. µSBS values between resin cement and the ceramic material were measured with a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min until the failure occurred. The fractured surfaces of specimens were microscopically evaluated, and failure modes were classified as: adhesive between resin cement and ceramic, cohesive within ceramic or cement and mixed failure. Surface roughness of etched samples was examined using a scanning electron microscope. Obtained data were statistically analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni post hoc test with a level of significance α = 0.05. The results of the statistical methods applied indicate that µSBS mean difference for leucite-reinforced ceramic (EP) was statistically significant (p < 0.05). However, µSBS values for hybrid ceramic (VE) and lithium disilicate ceramic (EX) were not affected, from a statistical point of view, by the conditioning time (p > 0.05).",Materials,10.3390/ma15207071
Mn-Doped Glass–Ceramic Bioactive (Mn-BG) Thin Film to Selectively Enhance the Bioactivity of Electrospun Fibrous Polymeric Scaffolds,"© 2022 by the authors.In recent years, significant progress has been made in the development of new technologies to meet the demand for engineered interfaces with appropriate properties for osteochondral unit repair and regeneration. In this context, we combined two methodologies that have emerged as powerful approaches for tissue engineering application: electrospinning to fabricate a nanofibrous polymeric scaffold and pulsed laser deposition to tune and control the composition and morphology of the scaffold surface. A multi-component scaffold composed of synthetic and natural polymers was proposed to combine the biocompatibility and suitable mechanical properties of poly(D,L-lactic acid) with the hydrophilicity and cellular affinity of gelatin. As part of a biomimetic strategy for the generation of bi-functional scaffolds, we coated the electrospun fibers with a thin film of a bioactive glass–ceramic material supplemented with manganese ions. The physico-chemical properties and composition of the bi-layered scaffold were investigated, and its bioactivity, in terms of induced mineralization, was tested by incubation in a simulated body fluid buffer. The processes of the inorganic film dissolution and the calcium phosphate phases growth were followed by microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, confirming that a combination of bioactive glass–ceramics and nanofibrous scaffolds has promising potential in the regeneration of osteochondral tissue due to its ability to induce mineralization in connective tissues.",Coatings,10.3390/coatings12101427
"Influence of Sintering on Thermal, Mechanical and Technological Properties of Glass Foams Produced from Agro-Industrial Residues","© 2022 by the authors.This study investigates the technological, thermal, mechanical, and technological properties of glass foams produced with soda-lime glass residues and rice husk ash sintered at 850–950 °C. The results for apparent density (0.28–0.30 g/cm3), porosity (82–87 ± 4%), compressive strength (1.18 ± 0.03–1.25 ± 0.03 MPa), and thermal conductivity (0.283–0.326 W/mK) are within the limits for commercial foams. The volumetric expansion potential and low thermal conductivity of the glass foams produced favor their use as thermal insulating materials in coat walls, thus improving thermal comfort in the construction sector. The results of X-ray fluorescence show that the foam glass is of the soda-lime type (SiO2, Na2O, and CaO), the rice husk ash is rich in SiO2, CaO, Na2O, Al2O3, K2O and Fe2O3, and the calcium carbonate is rich in CaO. The glass foams produced in this study are promising because they present more economical and efficient manufacturing, resulting in lightweight materials with thermal insulating properties that can be used in the construction sector. These glass foams also reduce the consumption of natural and synthetic raw materials, adding value to the waste used in this study by transforming them into co-products, thus favoring the economic circulation of the region.",Materials,10.3390/ma15196669
Assessment of Sand and Glass Industry in Saudi Arabia,"© 2022 by the authors.Although the economic value of glass products and its importance to the Saudi National Economy is vast, not much information is available about the current state of the art of the industry. Likewise, little information is available about geography, potential sites for mining sand and the sand quality. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by presenting a feasibility study of fabricating normal glass and glass ceramics from Saudi Arabia’s domestically available raw materials. It discusses the current status of the glass industry in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East region. It also gives a brief explanation about the sand topography in Saudi Arabia. In order to determine the feasibility of fabricating glass using these raw materials, experimental data on the fabrication of normal glass and glass ceramics from indigenously available raw materials was obtained and reported as part of the findings of this paper. Firstly, normal transparent glass was able to be fabricated without any apparent large defects using sand collected from the Ar Rayis region in Saudi Arabia. Four nano-sized crystallization catalysts, namely VC, WC, TiC and Y2O3, were added to the constituents of the glass in 3 wt.%. For VC, the crystallization process was limited. The glass ceramics of WC consisted of multi-dimensional edges crystals which covered all the matrix. Gray crystalline whiskers were obtained by addition of TiC. The Y2O3- glass ceramics consisted of multi-directionally rosette crystals. Finally, the microhardness values of the added crystallization catalysts glass ceramics were obtained and found to be much higher compared to normal glass. The results show that glass of high quality can be produced specifically for the Ar Rayis region which would be of interest to researchers, the glass industry personnel and potential investors.",Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su141912904
Invar/WC Composite Compacts Obtained by Spark Plasma Sintering from Mechanically Alloyed Powders,"© 2022 by the authors.The composite materials are used on an increasingly large scale in top fields, such as the automotive, aerospace, and nuclear industries, due to the combination of the specific properties of the composite components. Invar/WC nanocrystalline composite compacts were successfully obtained by spark plasma sintering from mechanical milled composite powder. The influence of the amount of tungsten carbide (WC) on sintering, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and hardness has been investigated. The relative density and hardness of Invar/WC composite compacts increases with increasing the WC content up to 10 vol.%. At higher amount of WC (15% vol.), the relative density and hardness of the Invar/WC composite compacts decreases. The temperature up to which CTE remains at a low value (0.6–1) × 10−6 °C−1 is influenced by the WC content and decreases with the WC amount of increase.",Materials,10.3390/ma15196714
Novel Functional Glass–Ceramic Coatings on Titanium Substrates from Glass Powders and Reactive Silicone Binders,"© 2022 by the authors.‘Silica-defective glasses’, combined with a silicone binder, have been already shown as a promising solution for the manufacturing of glass–ceramics with complex geometries. A fundamental advantage is the fact that, after holding glass powders together from room temperature up to the firing temperature, the binder does not completely disappear. More precisely, it converts into silica when heat-treated in air. A specified ‘target’ glass–ceramic formulation results from the interaction between glass powders and the binder-derived silica. The present paper is dedicated to the extension of the approach to the coating of titanium substrates (to be used for dental and orthopedic applications), with a bioactive wollastonite–diopside glass–ceramic layer, by the simple airbrushing of suspensions of glass powders in alcoholic silicone solutions. The interaction between glass and silica from the decomposition of the binder led to crack-free glass–ceramic coatings, upon firing in air; in argon, the glass/silicone mixtures yielded novel composite coatings, embedding pyrolytic carbon. The latter phase enabled the absorption of infrared radiation from the coating, which is useful for disinfection purposes.",Polymers,10.3390/polym14194016
Microstructural control of CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramics by the amounts of tungsten oxide and carbon added as nucleation agent sources,"© 2022 The Ceramic Society of Japan. All rights reserved.Microstructural control of CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 (CAS) glass-ceramics (GCs) bearing metastable CaAl2Si2O8, a layered crystal, from a parent glass having a single composition was achieved by increasing the amounts of WO3 and carbon used as sources of metallic W particle nucleation agents. The average crystal size increased from 9.3 to 49 μm when the amount of WO3 and carbon were increased fivefold in the preparation of CAS GCs. To investigate the effect of WO3 and carbon separately, glass cullet containing WO3 was mixed with glass batches containing carbon and then melted to form glass specimens with different amounts of WO3 and carbon. Upon crystallization of these glass specimens, the average crystal size increased from 9.0 μm to 43 or 49 μm when the amount of WO3 or carbon was increased fivefold, respectively. The results indicate that changing the amounts of WO3 and carbon is necessary to control the CAS GC microstructure.",Journal of the Ceramic Society of Japan,10.2109/jcersj2.22088

Effect of Na2O Content on the Structure and Properties of LAS Glass-ceramics Prepared by Spodumene,"© 2022, Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, Part of Springer Nature.The Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 (LAS) glass-ceramics with low lithium content were prepared from spodumene mineral by melting method. XRD, DSC, and FTIR were used to study the crystallization process and structure of the samples. The results showed that the addition of Na2O promoted the precipitation of β-quartz solid solution and its transformation to β-spodumene solid solution. Mechanical performance tests and FESEM indicated that the larger grain size and inhomogeneous grain dispersion caused by the increase of Na2O content led to lower mechanical properties. In addition, low expansion glass-ceramics were prepared by an appropriate heat treatment according to DSC result, and when Na2O content was in the range of 1.22 wt% to 2.41 wt%, the average coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) (30–300 °C) increased from −5.810×10−7 to 5.322×10−7°C−1.","Journal Wuhan University of Technology, Materials Science Edition",10.1007/s11595-022-2598-8
Effect of EuF3 on Thermal and Luminescent Properties of Glasses in the 30BaZrF6 –70NaPO3 –хEuF3 System,"© 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.Abstract: 30BaZrF6–70NaPO3 glasses doped with 0.1–1.0 wt % EuF3 have been synthesized. The introduction of up to 1.0 wt % EuF3 has no noticeable effect on glass formation and thermal and crystallization stability of the glasses. Heat treatment of glasses can lead to the formation of glass ceramics. Crystallization during the heat treatment of glasses occurs in two stages with the appearance of Na3ZrF7, NaZr(PO4)3, and BaFPO3 crystalline phases in the glass phase. The presence of europium trifluoride in the glass is responsible for its luminescence, which increases without reaching saturation with increasing EuF3 content from 0.1 to 1.0 wt %.",Russian Journal of Inorganic Chemistry,10.1134/S0036023622100461
The effect of prolonged holding time on the mechanical property and microstructural property of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic,"© 2022, The Author(s).Repeat firing produces uncertainty about stabilizing lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (LDGC) material properties, even though prolonged holding time can enhance the mechanical property of LDGC during a single firing cycle. However, the effect of prolonged holding time and repeat firing on the mechanical property and microstructure of LDGC is not fully understood. In the present study, three groups of LDGC material were created: (i) extension of holding time (7 vs. 14 vs. 28 min) at 780–800 °C; (ii) holding time extension (7 vs. 14 min) and dual sintering at 800–820 °C, respectively; (iii) dual sintering with prolonged holding time (7 vs. 14 min) at 820–840 °C. The nano-indenter test revealed that prolonged holding time (14 and 28 min) promoted the enhancement of LDGC hardness and Young’s modulus. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that prolonged holding time increased and stabilized LD phase in LDGC, as well as induced residual compressive stress. Scanning electron microscopy showed that prolonged holding time increased LD crystal grains homogeneously and facilitated LDGC to form dense interlocking structure without enlarging crystal size grains significantly. In contrast, LDGC that dual sintered alone at 820–840 °C possessed inferior mechanical properties, coupled with heterogeneous crystal phases, residual tensile stress, and melted crystals grains in the porous microstructure. Interestingly, these deteriorated properties of LDGC caused by dual sintering alone could be counteracted by prolonging the holding time. Nevertheless, the LDGC materials displayed an excellent biocompatibility throughout the study. This study identified that prolonged holding time during repeated firing cycles stabilized LD phase and crystal grain size of LDGC, thus enhanced the mechanical properties, which provided a new insight to extend the repeat fired restoration longevity of LDGC.

Highly efficient green emission Cs4PbBr6 quantum dots with stable water endurance,"© 2022 Optica Publishing Group.To date, quantum dots (QDs) based on perovskite materials with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and stability have rarely been reported. In this work, Cs4PbBr6 QDs glass ceramic with high PLQY and water stability is obtained, and the research results confirm that the strong green emission originates from the trapping of free excitons by internal Br vacancies. The rise of Br vacancies and the spontaneous growth of multi-morphology Cs4PbBr6 QDs under the influence of air humidity increase the PLQY to 89.62%. Compared with pure QDs, the Cs4PbBr6 QDs maintain high-intensity luminescence after being immersed in water for up to 150 days. In short, this paper puts forward a new, to the best of our knowledge, and valuable perspective for investigating the luminescence of Cs4PbBr6 QDs glass ceramic derived from related work.",Optics Letters,10.1364/OL.471088
Deep Learning algorithm for the assessment of the first damage initiation monitoring the energy release of materials,"© 2022 Dario Santonocito, Dario Milone.Monitoring the energy release during fatigue tests of common engineering materials has been shown to give relevant information on fatigue properties, reducing the testing time and material consumption. During a static tensile test, it is possible to assess two distinct phases: In the first phase (Phase I), where all the crystals are elastically stressed, the temperature trend follows the linear thermoelastic law; while, in the second phase (Phase II), some crystals begin to deform, and the temperature assumes a non-linear trend. The macroscopic transition stress between Phase I and Phase II could be related to the “limit stress” that, if cyclically applied, would lead to material failure. Nowadays, it is impossible to distinguish the transition between Phase I and Phase II in an objective way. Indeed, it is up to the operator's experiences. This work aims to create a universal methodology that predicts the limit stress by assessing the change in temperature trend by adopting Neural Networks. A Deep Learning algorithm has been created and trained on experimental data coming from static tensile tests performed on several classes of materials (steels, plastics, composite materials). Once trained, the network can predict the transition temperature at which the first plastic deformation occurs within the material.",Frattura ed Integrita Strutturale,10.3221/IGF-ESIS.62.34
Lithium-ion conductive glass-ceramic electrolytes enable safe and practical Li batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdRecently, lithium-ion conductive glass-ceramic materials have received tremendous attention owing to their high ionic conductivity, wide-ranging potential window, absence of leakage and pollution, virtuous chemical stability and non-flammable properties. The promising prospects establish them robust and efficient materials for solid state electrolyte/separator for sustaining the development of next generation lithium batteries. However, research on the glass-ceramics electrolytes is still in its initial stage, and the exciting performance offer needs further validation and fundamental exploration.

The aspects of structural ionic conductivity emphasizing on migration mechanism of lithium-ion, electrode interface, and electrochemical stability are covered. The key problems and challenges of such materials are described with respect to development of optimized materials, their microstructural optimization, and promising compositions. Finally, solutions to electrode/electrolyte interface constraints are summarized, and the development prospects of such materials are updated.

Development of fluoride-containing glass–ceramics using eggshells waste as calcium source,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.This paper reports on developing low-cost fluoride-containing glass–ceramics derived from eggshells waste as a source of calcium via the conventional melt-quenching method. The physical, structural, and mechanical properties of the samples before and after sintering is highlighted in this study. XRD and FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of fluorapatite, wollastonite, and cuspidine phases. It is worth noting that adding fluoride to the glass system would lead to the improvement of the mechanical properties of the final product. Among all, the sample sintered at 700 °C achieved the highest density and mechanical properties. It obtained a density value of 2.626 g/cm3, a microhardness result of 6.72 GPa, and fracture toughness of 3.55 MPa·m1/2. These results are better than commercial 45S5 bioglass (0.148 GPa–0.375 GPa) and comparable to the properties of human enamel (2.00 GPa–6.00 GPa). These findings would be believed to contribute to a low-cost waste-derived fluoride-containing glass–ceramics system in the dental application.",Applied Physics A: Materials Science and Processing,10.1007/s00339-022-06042-6
Model-free digital workflow and immediate functional loading of implant-supported monolithic glass-ceramic crowns: A case series,"© 2022Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate surgical and prosthetic outcomes of immediate functional loading of implants with glass-ceramic screw-retained single crowns. Methods: A total of 22 implants were placed. Within 24 h, functional full-contour glass ceramic crowns were delivered to patients. The amount of attached gingiva, Simplified Oral Hygiene Index Score, bleeding on probing, time after extraction, bone type, implant size, soft tissue thickness, primary stability, a general fit of the restoration, occlusal and proximal contacts were recorded. Restorations were followed-up at 1, 3, and 6 months tracking marginal bone loss (MBL), noting changes in occlusal and interproximal contacts, checking other possible complications. Results: One implant failed and was removed after 4 weeks (95.5% survival rate). The rest of the implants and crowns functioned with no complications during the follow-up period of 6 months. Factors such as time after extraction, bone type, implant size, soft tissue thickness, and primary stability recorded in Ncm and implant stability quotient (ISQ) values, were not associated with MBL (p<0.05). Mean MBL was found to be 0.3 mm (standard deviation = 0.42) mesially and 0.4 mm (standard deviation = 0.66) distally. One distal and one mesial proximal contact were found to be missing at the 6-month check-up appointment. Conclusions: Within the limits of this study, fully digital workflow without a 3D printed model could be successfully employed for immediate functional loading with single-unit implant-supported crowns. Further studies are needed to obtain long-term results with a larger sample of patients. Clinical significance: Model-free digital workflow and immediate functional loading of implant-supported monolithic glass-ceramic crown might be viable option to restore a single tooth defect.",Journal of Dentistry,10.1016/j.jdent.2022.104270
Ionic Mott-Schottky formalism allows the assessment of mobile ion concentrations in Li+-conducting solid electrolytes,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Li+-conducting solid electrolytes have been in the focus of researchers for the last decade thanks to the recent efforts to develop efficient all-solid-state batteries. While material scientists discovered new compounds with unprecedented Li+ conductivities, surprisingly often, a fundamental question remains: What fraction of the total lithium-ions inside the solid electrolyte is mobile and thus contributes to the conductivity? In this work, we propose an approach, which can be considered as a Mott-Schottky-based analysis applied to an ionically conducting system, to calculate the concentration of mobile Li+ in a lithium-conducting glass–ceramic. We use the space charge layer (SCL) capacitances obtained from the electrochemical impedance data recorded at different bias potentials and temperatures as the input. We demonstrate that the space charge layer in the ionic conductors can be formally described similarly to the SCLs formed in semiconductors in contact with, e.g., liquid electrolytes. This analysis makes it possible to provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of conductivity and its temperature dependencies in the SCL in ion conductors and, in general, help to uncover the nature of the mobility of Li-ions in various Li+-conducting electrolytes.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry,10.1016/j.jelechem.2022.116750
3D Printing of Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymeric Composites: A Review,"© 2022, The Institution of Engineers (India).Fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) materials are extensively used in structural applications related to sports, defense, aerospace, and automotive-based industries. Due to their upper-level strength and lesser specific weight features, glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite materials, among other reinforced materials, have been progressively displacing traditional materials. GFRP has significantly superior fatigue resistance than metals, as well as stronger dampening qualities essential for vibration reduction and improved comfort. GFRP has lately been created to build high-performing composites and bring up new opportunities. It is the less expensive reinforcing choice under periodic loading circumstances, bends till final fracture, and is the most cost-effective reinforcing option. The current review concentrates on a brief background study of 3DP of GFRP in the form of a network diagram, a discussion of composites materials, techniques used of 3DP of GFRP, and a literature review that mentions a briefing of some papers related to GFRP 3DP with fused filament fabrication (FFF) printing technique. In the case study, the FFF technology has been used to construct tensile specimens of ABS/GF composites. The case study of the GFRP manufacturing by the FFF process has been validated with tensile testing and X-ray diffraction (XRD)-based analysis. The results of the study have been suggested the addition of glass fiber (GF) in ABS increases the tensile strength and reduces the crystallinity.",Journal of The Institution of Engineers (India): Series C,10.1007/s40032-022-00873-1
Eu3+-Tb3+-Tm3+ co-doped oxyfluoride glass with high quantum yield for a robust white LED color converter,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.BaF2–Al2O3–B2O3–SiO2 glasses and glass-ceramics doped with Eu3+-Tb3+ were fabricated as an inorganic color converter for white LEDs. The BaF2–Al2O3–B2O3 glass composition was modified by adding SiO2, and thermal and mechanical stability improved with increasing SiO2 content while maintaining a quantum yield (QY) as high as 91%. To realize white color coordinates, Tm3+ was additionally introduced at varying contents, and Eu3+ content was also controlled. Excellent chromatic properties, such as a pure white color coordinates (x = 0.33, y = 0.33) with a co-related color temperature of 5772K, and a color rendering index (CRI) of 91 under 370 nm excitation, were successfully achieved. After the glass was heat-treated at 600 °C to fabricate a glass ceramic, the glass-ceramics were mounted on top of a 370 nm UV-LED, successfully demonstrating a white LED with nearly pure white color coordinates and a high CRI of 86. The increased emission intensity in the glass-ceramic was attributed to the formation of BaF2 crystals which were investigated by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and a transmission electron microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM-EDS).",Optical Materials,10.1016/j.optmat.2022.112882
Effect of the thickness of CAD-CAM materials on the shear bond strength of light-polymerized resin cement,"© 2022 Scandinavian Division of the International Association for Dental Research. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.This study aimed to investigate the effect of the thickness of computer aided design-computer aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorative materials on the bond strength of light-polymerized resin cement. Ninety specimens were prepared from three different CAD-CAM materials (a leucite-based glass-ceramic [Empress CAD], a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network [Vita Enamic], and a zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic [Vita Suprinity]) in different thicknesses (1, 2, and 3 mm). One surface of each specimen was treated by using a single-step self-etching ceramic primer (Monobond Etch & Prime). Light-polymerized resin cement was bonded to treated surfaces by exposure to a light-emitting diode curing unit from the untreated side of the samples. Shear bond strength (SBS) between the ceramic and the resin cement was measured by using a universal testing machine. The leucite-based glass-ceramic had higher SBS values than the other materials at each thickness. For each material, 1 mm-thick specimens had the highest SBS values. The difference between the SBS values of 2 mm- and 3 mm-thick polymer-infiltrated ceramic network was nonsignificant, whereas the SBS values of 2 mm-thick leucite-based glass-ceramic and the zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic were significantly higher than those of the corresponding 3 mm-thick specimens. The choice of the material and its thickness may be highly important for clinical success when light-polymerized resin cements are used for cementation.",European Journal of Oral Sciences,10.1111/eos.12892
"Effects of material and piston diameter on the fatigue behavior, failure mode, and stress distribution of feldspathic ceramic simplified restorations","© 2022 Elsevier LtdThis study evaluated the influence of the piston material (glass fiber-reinforced epoxy resin or stainless steel) and the piston tip diameter (6 or 40 mm) on the fatigue mechanical behavior, failure mode, and stress distribution of feldspathic ceramic simplified restorations. Pistons were machined in glass fiber-reinforced epoxy resin (ER) and in stainless steel (SS), with active tips simulating the curvature radius of 6- or 40-mm diameter spheres. A total of sixty (N= 60) feldspathic ceramic discs (Ø= 10 mm; thickness= 1.0 mm) were adhesively luted onto supporting substrate discs (Ø= 10 mm; thickness= 2.5 mm) and allocated into 4 groups (n= 15) according to the piston used for fatigue testing: ER_6, ER_40, SS_6, SS_40. Afterwards, the specimens were submitted to the cyclic fatigue test (20 Hz frequency; initial load= 100 N; step= 50 N; 10,000 cycles/step, upon specimen failure detection). The collected data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (α= 0.05) to verify differences by considering ‘piston material’ and ‘piston diameter’ as factors, and their association. In addition, a survival analysis (Kaplan Meier with Mantel-Cox log-rank post-hoc tests) was conducted (α= 0.05). Fractographic and finite element (FEA) analyzes were also performed. ‘Piston material’ (p= 0.040, F= 4.43) and ‘piston diameter’ (p < 0.000, F= 563.21) had a significant influence on the fatigue failure load (FFL) and the number of cycles for failure (CFF) values. Feldspathic restorations showed higher FFL and CFF (p < 0.05) when tested with a 40 mm diameter piston compared to a 6 mm diameter piston (ER_40 and SS_40 > ER_6 > SS_6). In relation to the piston material, ER and SS pistons with 40 mm diameter promoted similar fatigue performance (ER_40: 946.67 N/179,333 cycles = SS_40: 936.67 N/177,333 cycles), while 6 mm diameter groups presented different fatigue performance (ER_6: 440 N; 78,000 cycles > SS_6: 353.3 N; 60,667 cycles). Hertzian cone crack failures were only observed in the groups tested with 6 mm pistons, regardless of piston material. Higher stress concentration on the ceramic surface was observed when using 6 mm diameter pistons, whereas the SS_6 group showed a slight increase in stress concentration in comparison to the ER_6 group. The piston diameter showed an influence on the fatigue behavior, failure mode, and stress distribution of feldspathic ceramic simplified restorations. However, the influence of piston material is only observed when 6 mm diameter pistons are used. The 40 mm diameter pistons led to radial crack, being more appropriate for fatigue test of simplified feldspathic ceramic restorations with a thickness ≤ 1 mm. Whilst the 6 mm diameter pistons should be avoided, once tend to induce Hertzian cone crack failures and to underestimate fatigue performance.",Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105398
Compact retarding potential analyzers enabled by glass-ceramic vat polymerization for CubeSat and laboratory plasma diagnostics,"© 2022 The AuthorsWe report the design, fabrication, and characterization of novel, digitally manufactured, compact retarding potential analyzers (RPAs), i.e., multi-electrode instruments that can be used as in-orbit mass spectrometers and as on-ground/in-orbit ion energy analyzers. Unlike most RPAs reported in the literature, our devices enforce active aperture alignment across the grid stack, maximizing ion transmission. The RPA electrode housing (the most critical component of the RPA, as it precisely positions the electrodes to maximize grid stack transmission while avoiding space charge effects and providing electrical insulation) is additively manufactured in Vitrolite® (a printable glass-ceramic) via vat polymerization, resulting in non-porous, high-temperature compatible, and high-vacuum compatible hardware. Metrology of as-printed (green) VitroliteⓇ parts shows an in-plane, per axis manufacturing accuracy of 60 µm (i.e., the in-plane length of the voxels) and an out-of-plane manufacturing accuracy of 100 µm (i.e., the height of the slices). VitroliteⓇ 3D-printed objects annealed at 900 °C show a ~5 % shrinkage, a slightly larger maximum tensile stress, a similar Young's modulus, and a larger compression yield stress compared to green samples. Also, the assembly misalignment between the grids and a 3D-printed housing annealed at 900 °C is a twofold larger compared to using a green housing. Annealing 3D-printed VitroliteⓇ at temperatures above 900 °C causes significant distortion of the printed part due to material reflow, which is incompatible with a precision engineering application. Four different RPA designs were synthesized to probe the ionosphere (design with floating grid alignment at the aperture level) and laboratory plasmas (designs with floating grid aperture alignment at the cluster level). Simulations conducted in this study show that the RPA design that enforces floating grid aperture alignment at the aperture level attains the best performance, although RPA designs that implement floating grid aperture alignment at the cluster level are more resilient to grid misalignment. Experimental characterization of the RPAs using an ion source and a helicon plasma source is consistent with expected performance and the literature. Plasmas with a Debye length as small as 50 µm were successfully characterized using the reported sensors, matching the performance of state-of-the-art RPAs manufactured via semiconductor microfabrication.",Additive Manufacturing,10.1016/j.addma.2022.103034
"Effects of B2O3 on crystallization kinetics, microstructure and properties of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3-based glass-ceramics","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-ionic conductors of Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 family are considered as one of the most attractive solid electrolytes. Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 composition obtained by glass-ceramic route exhibits the highest electrical conductivity at room temperature. The introduction of sintering additives makes it possible to modify the properties of solid electrolytes. Glass-ceramics of the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3–xB2O3 series (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 wt%) was obtained by glass crystallization at optimal conditions of heat treatment. The influence of B2O3 additive on thermal stability and crystallization process of initial glasses was studied by DSC method. The phase composition, microstructure and transport properties of glass-ceramics were investigated by XRD, SEM and impedance spectroscopy, respectively. The structure of the glass-ceramics was characterized by Raman spectroscopy. Glass-ceramics was found to be single-phase (R-3c) when 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.15, but impurity phases Li4P2O7 and AlPO4 appear at x = 0.20. The conductivity of B2O3-added solid electrolytes is higher compared to the pristine Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3. Its ionic conductivity reached 5.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C.

Numerical simulations of grinding force and surface morphology during precision grinding of leucite glass ceramics,"© 2022Leucite glass ceramics are high-performance denture materials due to their high mechanical strength, excellent light transmittance, and excellent biocompatibility. Glass-ceramic denture must be processed using precision grinding technology to achieve a satisfactory surface integrity. To understand the contact interaction between the abrasives and workpiece, a theoretical model of grinding force during grinding of leucite glass ceramics was developed by considering elastic-to-ductile transition depth, brittle-to-ductile transition depth, strain rate effect, and random distributions of the abrasive position and size. In addition, a surface morphology model was developed to understand the material removal and deformation behaviors during grinding of leucite glass ceramics, which considered the brittle-to-ductile transition depth, elastic recovery, and random distributions of the abrasive position and size. The mechanical properties of leucite glass ceramics used in the models were measured by nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests. Grinding experiments of leucite glass ceramics were performed to verify the accuracy of the models, and the results showed that the predicted errors of the force and surface morphology models were within 10% and 15%, respectively. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrated that small abrasive size, low feed speed, small grinding depth, and high grinding speed were beneficial to improving the surface quality, and large abrasive size, low feed speed, small grinding depth, and high grinding speed were beneficial to decreasing the grinding force. The results will provide a theoretical guidance for optimizing process parameters during high-efficiency and precision grinding of hard and brittle solids.",International Journal of Mechanical Sciences,10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2022.107562

Delithiation dynamics of the LICGC electrolyte out of the voltage limits,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The recently developed concept of an all-solid-state Li battery is deemed by many as a breakthrough toward safer and higher-capacity rechargeable devices. This, in turn, motivates the researchers in pushing all the battery components up to and beyond operational limits to test the materials’ performance. Herein we present an in-situ characterization of the response of the Lithium Conductive Glass-Ceramic (LICGC) solid electrolyte to the application of a cycling voltage, extending the operating limits up to ±15 V. The purpose was to clarify the dynamics of the delithiation process out of the standard conditions. The Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has been employed to monitor the evolution of the LICGC surface morphology induced by high voltage. The in-situ measurement showed that the delithiation of LICGC (encompassed with thin metallic current collectors) leads to the out-diffusion of Li through defects in the current collectors, and the formation of the Li-based nanoparticles (NPs) on the sample surface. The growth of NPs and the formation of nano-to-macro clusters is dependent on the applied voltage: the higher the voltage the larger the NPs. The AFM results are supported by the Neutron Depth Profiling data, which confirm high concentrations of Li in NPs, and by X-rays photoelectron spectroscopy, which clarifies the composition of NPs.",Surfaces and Interfaces,10.1016/j.surfin.2022.102207

"Microstructure, cytocompatibility, and chemical durability of chemically strengthened LAS (Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2) glass-ceramic materials","© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe K+-Na+ ion exchange was used to strengthen LAS glass-ceramic materials prepared by hot-pressing sintering. The microstructure, cytocompatibility, and chemical durability of the chemically strengthened LAS glass-ceramics were characterized. The XRD results showed that the K+-Na+ ion exchange mainly occurred between the glass phase of the LAS glass-ceramics and molten salt baths. The ion-exchange process was mainly responsible for the improved chemical durability of the LAS glass-ceramics. The dissolution in acetic acid was significantly reduced from 72 to 15 μg·cm−2 after the ion-exchange treatment, which was attributed to residual compressive stress and increased contents of Q3 and Q4 structural units in the surface region of the LAS glass-ceramics. In addition, the chemically strengthened LAS glass-ceramic samples exhibited good biocompatibility determined by the CCK-8 process using the L929 cell line, having a promising potential as dental restorative materials.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.06.063

The results show that the structural heterogeneity in the PG sample increases with lowering Thomo, and this promotes phase-separation, and hence, formation of Ba2LaF7 crystals. Consequently, the light transmittance of PG samples is decreased, but the up-conversion (UC) luminescence is enhanced. Moreover, the crystallinity of the four PG samples was increased by HT, and this altered the light transmittance, and greatly enhanced the UC luminescence. The mechanism of these discovered phenomena was discussed in terms of structure and crystal evolution. This work provides an effective way to optimize the optical and photonic performances of the rare earth doped oxyfluoride glass-ceramics.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121773
Engineering of silicone-based blends for the masked stereolithography of biosilicate/carbon composite scaffolds,"© 2022 The AuthorsSilicone resins, filled with phosphates and other oxide fillers, have been recently proposed as feedstock for the manufacturing of scaffolds with a composition resembling that of commercial Biosilicate® glass-ceramics. Silicones and engineered fillers enable the preparation of novel carbon-containing Biosilicate-based composites and, fundamentally, the easy application of additive manufacturing technologies. After successful demonstration of the applicability of direct ink writing of silicone-based pastes, the present paper is dedicated to preparation of highly porous scaffolds obtained by masked stereolithography, starting from a simple blend of silicone resin with commercial photocurable acrylates. Deviations in the desired phase assemblage were corrected by calibration of the silicone/fillers ratio. The more advanced printing technology, combined with ceramic transformation, allowed fabrication of scaffolds with a complex geometry and a distinctive control of overall porosity.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.06.057
Preparation and properties of cordierite glass-ceramic as veneer porcelain for silicon nitride dental ceramics,"© 2022To develop thermally matched veneer porcelain for silicon nitride as potential dental ceramics, cordierite glass-ceramics with TiO2 and ZrO2 as nucleating agents and CaCO3 as sintering aids were prepared by sintering method. The cordierite glass-ceramics prepared by sintering and crystallization at 1100 °C for 1 h show the best comprehensive properties and meet the ISO 6872:2015 with flexural strength of 95 MPa, fracture toughness of 1.56 MPa·m1/2, Vickers hardness of 5.06 GPa, coefficient of thermal expansion of 2.99 × 10−6/°C and chemical solubility of 60 μg/cm2, respectively, and no cytotoxicity. The chromaticity values L*, a*, b* were 93.84, − 0.18 and 7.10 respectively, which still needs to be slightly adjusted to fall into the range of natural tooth. Interface bonding of cordierite glass-ceramics/Si3N4 ceramics was preliminarily explored by powder coating, sintering and shear strength tests, which exhibits a bonding strength up to 7.75 MPa and a hybrid mode of cohesive and adhesive failure.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.06.072
Effect of SiO2/Al2O3 Ratio on the Crystallization and Heavy Metal Immobilization of Glass Ceramics Derived from Stainless Steel Slag,"© 2022This study investigated the effects of the SiO2/Al2O3 mass ratio on the glass stability, crystallization and heavy metal immobilization of glass ceramics derived from stainless steel slag (SSS). When the SiO2/Al2O3 mass ratio decreased from 11.2 to 4.2, the glass stability and the depolymerization degree of the parent glass increased from 2.13 to 2.40 and subsequently decreased to 2.31. The predominant crystal phase of the resulting glass–ceramics changed from pyroxene and diopside to wollastonite, pyroxene, and diopside as the crystallization temperature of samples increased from 800°C to 860°C. The heavy metals, Cr and Mn, from SSS cured in the spinel of glass–ceramics, whereas the hazardous metal Ni was primarily found in pyroxene (CaNiSi2O6). In addition, the leached concentrations of hazardous metals, Ni, Mn, and Cr ions, in glass-ceramics were far below the national standard. The results showed that it is possible and safe to turn SSS into eco-friendly glass-ceramic.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121770
Eu3+ heavily doped tellurite glass ceramic as an efficient red phosphor for white LED,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.To design a phosphor for near ultraviolet (n-UV) based white light emitting diodes (wLED) with low correlated color temperature (CCT) and high CRI, a series of highly Eu3+ activated tellurite samples was prepared. Glass ceramic (GC) containing Eu2Te6O15 microcrystals were obtained as a function of crystallization time from 0 to 4 h at 435 °C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and cathodoluminescence measurement confirm the existence Eu2Te6O15 microcrystals in translucent glass ceramic, improving the luminescence properties of the samples. Upon 393 nm excitation two intense emission bands centered at 594 nm and 614 nm were observed with an increase of 200% for the crystallized samples at 435 °C for 4 h with respect to as-fabricated glasses. Radiometric properties of heavily (10 mol %) Eu3+ doped samples as a function of crystallization time were investigated and the maximum luminous efficacy (LE) obtained is 12.01 lm/W for a crystallization time of 4 h. A green phosphor (SrBaSiO4:Eu2+) on top of samples was used the construct a white light-emitting diode and the results show that the color coordinate temperature (CCT) can be tuned from 4729 K to 3405 K as crystallization time increase from 0 to 4 h with a diminishing of LE from 34.3 to 19 lm/W. The results show that tellurite glass and GC present enormous potential as phosphor converters in solid state lighting application.",Journal of Luminescence,10.1016/j.jlumin.2022.119080
Glass-ceramic joining of Fe22Cr porous alloy to Crofer22APU: interfacial issues and mechanical properties,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.This work deals with the joining of porous Fe22Cr ferritic stainless steel to a dense Crofer22APU plate by using a silica-based, Ba-containing glass-ceramic. The chemical and interfacial stability and the mechanical properties of the joints were evaluated before and after thermal ageing at 700 °C for 500hrs. The sintering behaviour of the glass was assessed by using heating stage microscopy (HSM) to study the influence of a porous metal substrate on the shrinkage of the joining material. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that there were no defects or cracks at the porous alloy/glass-ceramic interface for both the as-joined samples and the samples after thermal ageing at 700 °C for 500 h. However, at this exposure temperature, the porous alloy started to form an oxide scale at the interface with the glass-ceramic and the internal surface of the porous alloy. Finally, the evaluation of the mechanical properties by tensile testing showed that the properties were not affected by thermal ageing at 700 °C.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.166
A systematic review and meta-analysis of bond strength studies associated with self-etching primer and HF acid etching of dental glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdObjective: This review aims to provide a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the effect of self-etching ceramic primer (SECP) on the resin–ceramic bond strength, as reported in published in-vitro studies. Materials and methods: Three databases (MEDLINE “PubMed”, Scopus and Web-of-Science) were electronically searched to identify studies that evaluated the effect of SECP on the bond strength to glass-ceramics versus the conventional treatment (hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching + silane-primer (S) application). Meta-analysis was conducted with RevMan version 5.4 software, Cochrane Collaboration; Copenhagen, Denmark using a random effect model, considering the bond strength evaluation after artificial aging. Results: Thirty-six studies satisfied the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis, while only 18 studies were included in the quantitative analysis (meta-analysis). Twenty-three studies (63.9%) of the included studies showed a medium-risk of bias. The meta-analysis results showed no statistically significant difference (p ≥ 0.05) between resin-ceramic bond strength achieved following SECP or HF + S treatment with micro-shear bond strength (μSBS), tensile bond strength (TBS), and micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) evaluation. However, shear bond strength (SBS) evaluation showed significantly less bond strength of SECP compared with HF + S (p < 0.00001). Conclusion: SECP application can effectively promote adequate resin–ceramic bonding despite its mild etching capacity. However, more in-vitro studies that involve long-term clinically relevant artificial aging, and further clinical studies are required before SECP can be considered as an alternative to the conventional surface treatment (HF + S) of glass-ceramic materials.",International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives,10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2022.103216
Low-temperature sintering of CaZnSi2O6 glass ceramics with machinable precursor based on silicone rubber and enhanced mechanical strength by Bi2O3,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Machinable precursors were prepared using methyl vinyl silicone rubber, kilchoanite, fluxing agents, and nano silica. CaZnSi2O6 glass ceramics were sintered using machinable precursors at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1000 ℃. The microstructure and crystal phase during the heating process were analyzed by SEM and XRD. The flexural strength and linear contraction of the ceramics were measured. The results showed that Bi2O3 improved the flexural strength above 800 ℃. When the sintering temperature was 1000 ℃, Bi2O3 improved the flexural strength by 22%, from 90.54 to 110.48 MPa. Furthermore, the linear contraction increased by 1.88%, from 15% to 16.88%. Bi2O3 provided more liquid phase above 800 ℃, which connected the grains more tightly and caused the ceramics to shrink further, so that the ceramics with Bi2O3 had a denser microstructure and higher flexural strength.",Materials Letters,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.132650
Crystallization behavior and properties of a novel rare-earth rich BaO–SiO2–La2O3 glass-ceramic for millimeter-wave technology,"© 2022In this work, a novel low permittivity and high expansion coefficient rare-earth rich BaO–SiO2–La2O3 (BSL) glass-ceramic for millimeter-wave technology was systematically investigated by the network structure, crystallization the phase transformation, microstructure and microwave dielectric properties. With the decrease of the SiO2/BaO mol ratio from 3.75 to 0.9, the crystallization activation energy (Ec) of BSL glass calculated by the Kissiger equation continued to fall from 400.65 to 316.85 kJ/mol, and the crystal growth mode of all samples judging by Avrami parameter (n) was 1-D volume crystallization, implying that the crystallization ability of the BSL glass was enhanced. The main crystal phase of BSL glass-ceramic transformed from BaSi2O5 to BaSiO3 phase, coincided with a second phase Ba4La6O(SiO4)6. And then, the relative permittivity εr of BSL glass-ceramic had increased from 7.8 to 11, while quality factor (Q × f), temperature coefficient of frequency τf, and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) had decreased with the decrease of SiO2/BaO ratio. By adjusting the mol ratio of SiO2/BaO, the best comprehensive properties of 20BaO–75SiO2–5La2O3 glass-ceramic could be obtained with εr = 7.8, Q × f = 21000 GHz, CTE = 12.39 × 10−6/°C (30–800 °C), which was favorable properties for microwave dielectric applications.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.095
High toughness transparent glass-ceramics with petalite and β-spodumene solid solution as two major crystal phases,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.Lithium aluminosilicate glass-ceramics are well known for good transparency, high fracture toughness, low thermal expansion, and good ion exchange ability. In this study, new transparent Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 (LAS) glass-ceramics with petalite and β-spodumene solid solution as the major crystalline phases were invented for favorable mechanical properties and potential for application in the hollowware, tableware, container, and plate glass industries. Crystal phases are mainly influenced by the ratio of Al2O3 to SiO2 concentrations. The concentration of SiO2 required to form specific crystalline phases in the glass-ceramics is higher than that inferred from the ternary phase diagram. Al2O3 content is required to be sufficiently high for the formation of crystals, instead of balancing excess amounts of Li2O in the glass. The average transmittances of 2.0 ± 0.1 mm thickness samples in visible light regions (400–700 nm) can reach more than 80% with crystal sizes of 20–40 nm. Transmittance is significantly decreased for heat treatments around 710°C, due to the high growth rate of β-spodumene solid solution crystals. Vickers hardness, indentation toughness, and crack probabilities of transparent LAS glass-ceramics are significantly improved compared with standard soda lime silicate glass, due to the crack bridging and deflection of crystal grains.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/jace.18590
Effect of Er:YAG laser pretreatment on glass–ceramic surface in vitro,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.This study investigated the feasibility of using an Er:YAG laser to pretreat glass–ceramic surface and evaluate the effect of the treatment on the bonding strength and marginal adaptation between glass–ceramic and dentin. Glass–ceramic samples (CEREC Blocs) and third molars were cut into 6 mm × 6 mm × 2 mm plates. Thirty ceramic plates were randomly divided into 5 groups: group A (control), group B (pretreated with 9.6% hydrofluoric acid [HF]), group C (pretreated with the Er:YAG laser at 300 mJ and 15 Hz), group D (pretreated with the Er:YAG laser at 400 mJ and 15 Hz), and group E (pretreated with the Er:YAG laser at 500 mJ and 15 Hz). The surface morphologies of the samples in each group were studied under a scanning electron microscope, and the sample displaying optimal etching parameters was selected for subsequent experiments. Based on the surface treatments, 30 ceramic and dentin plates were randomly allocated into 3 groups: the control, laser, and acid-etching groups. After bonding a ceramic plate to a dentin plate, the microleakage and bonding strength were measured, and the pretreatment effects of the Er:YAG laser and 9.6% HF were compared. Group E exhibited an etching effect that was more pronounced and uniform than that in groups C and D. Microleakage and bonding strength analyses revealed that the laser and acid-etching groups differed significantly from the control group in dye penetration depth and shear strength (P < 0.05), although the laser and acid-etching groups did not differ from each other. Both 9.6% hydrofluoric acid and Er:YAG laser pretreatments can coarsen glass–ceramic surfaces, improve the marginal adaptation and bonding strength between the glass–ceramic and dentin, and decrease microleakage of the materials. The two treatments showed no apparent differences in pretreatment outcomes.",Lasers in Medical Science,10.1007/s10103-022-03593-1
"Preparation, structure and optical properties of Nd2O3 doped Gd2O3-Ga2O3-GeO2 transparent glass-ceramics containing novel GdGaGe2O7 nanocrystal","© 2022 Elsevier LtdIn this paper, Nd2O3 doped Gd2O3-Ga2O3-GeO2 ternary glass was prepared by traditional melting method. DSC was used to characterize the thermodynamic properties of the parent glass and its crystallization mechanism was discussed. The structure of the glass ceramics containing novel GdGaGe2O7 nanocrystal was measured by XRD, SEM and EDS, and the properties were characterized by transmittance and emission spectroscopy. The results show that the glass-ceramics has obvious advantages in fluorescence performance, which the emission intensity at 1060 nm is up to 5.5 times higher than that of the parent glass. Among them, the sample nucleated at 740 ℃ for 6 h and crystallized at 840 ℃ for 1 h has the best performance, which the emission intensity increased by 1.6 times when the transmittance decreased by only 1.6%.

"Influences of crystallization temperature on the structure, dielectric, and energy storage characteristics of KBaSrNb5O15-based glass–ceramics","© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.Glass–ceramics capacitors have great application potential in pulsed power systems, due to ultrafast discharge speed and high dielectric breakdown strength (BDS). Here, lead-free niobate glass–ceramic dielectric materials were synthesized, and the effects of heat treatment temperature on the dielectric, ferroelectric, and energy storage properties of glass–ceramics were investigated comprehensively. The results exhibit that the dielectric permittivity first increases and then decreases as the crystallinity increases; however, the dielectric BDS diminishes. At the optimum crystallization temperature of 740°C, the maximum value of discharge energy density is 2.2 J/cm3 at 600 kV/cm, which is about 7.6 times that of mother glass. Furthermore, an ultrahigh power density of about 380.9 MW/cm3 and ultrafast discharge speed of about 11.2 ns were achieved simultaneously. Meanwhile, great thermal stability of charge–discharge property was verified in this glass–ceramics. According to P–E loops and dielectric test result, a high dielectric constant (∼207) and low dielectric loss (<0.005) as well as high energy storage efficiency of about 94.9% were achieved for G740 sample.

Matching correlation study of titanium-based ceramics with glass based on dissolution characteristics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdGlass-ceramics are ideal candidates in Low-temperature Cofired Ceramic (LTCC) technology. The “dissolution-precipitation” mechanism ensures the sintering compactness of glass-ceramics at low temperatures. The ceramics must be dissolved and precipitated in the liquid phase with the assistance of glass additives. In this case, the characterization of dissolution behaviors that should be highly valued has rarely been emphasized. This study puts forward a simple, repeatable, and efficient design for characterizing the dissolution behaviors of several titanium-based ceramics in glass frits under variable temperature conditions. Interestingly, a glass frit with good wettability does not ensure the low-temperature sintering process of a ceramic matrix. In contrast, the dissolution characteristics of ceramics in the glass should be seriously considered. Hopefully, the study of dissolution behaviors could strengthen the fundamental understanding of the low-temperature sintering of ceramics and offer a glass-ceramic design strategy for developing high-performance.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.06.014
Study of the hexagonal to monoclinic celsian phase transition induced by magnetic phase nucleation in barium aluminosilicate glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe inert hexagonal to monoclinic celsian (H-M) phase transition extremely restricts the formation of celsian. In this study, Fe3+ dopants were incorporated into nonmagnetic barium aluminosilicate (BAS) glass-ceramics using Fe(NO3)3.9 H2O as raw material for preparing the celsian phase. As the Fe-Ba mole ratio reached 0.238, the celsian phase can be obtained in magnetic BAS glass-ceramics. It implied that some magnetic reaction products facilitated the H-M phase transition. To examine the above inference, magnetic barium ferrite (BFO) additions were externally incorporated into a pure BAS glass matrix. Results suggested that BFO additions can significantly promote the H-M phase transition. When the addition of BFO was increased to 5 wt %, almost all of the hexacelsian phase was converted into the celsian phase. And the reason was that barium ferrite can act as a nucleation agent to induce the distorted hexacelsian phase decreasing the H-M phase transition barrier.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.06.011
Microstructural and residual stress effects on toughening of stoichiometric BaO.2SiO2 glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdBarium disilicate (BaO.2SiO2=BS2) glass is one of the few stoichiometric glasses that nucleates internally, homogeneously via thermal treatment. This system has been scarcely assessed in microstructure-property studies. Here we address fracture strength and toughness (KIC) variation as a function of crystallized volume fraction and crystal size, as well as the possible effect of residual stresses (RS) in BS2 glass-ceramics (GCs) by independently varying these two microstructural parameters. KIC increased with spherulite size and crystallized volume fraction. KIC variation with crystallized volume fraction was similar for GCs with different crystal sizes. Combination of the current findings on BaO.2SiO2 (crystals under tensile RS) with previous studies of Li2O.2SiO2 GCs (compressive RS) indicates that crystallization of a tougher phase – not type of residual stress in the crystals – is the crucial parameter controlling fracture toughness and strength. These findings are quite useful to design novel strong and tough GCs.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.05.073
"Impact of sintering temperature on phase composition, microstructure, and porosification behavior of LTCC substrates","© 2022 The AuthorsPhase development and changes in crystalline composition of LTCC material during the sintering process were investigated using in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. CeramTape GC was chosen as the chemically simplest model system composed of alumina particles and glass for the investigations. The chemical characterization and microstructural analyses of the tapes sintered with some representative firing profiles were performed by techniques such as (scanning) transmission electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and XRD. Moreover, the porosification behavior of LTCC substrates fired at different peak temperatures was studied. These investigations are important for the subsequent wet chemical etching, representing an approach which allows to reduce locally the permittivity of LTCC tapes. Treatment with a KOH solution shows non-selective etching behavior for all substrates. In addition, highly porous silica structures corresponding to Ca and Al depletion from the anorthite phase were observed in all samples after etching treatment.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.05.049
Fatigue life prediction and optimization of GFRP composites based on Failure Tensor Polynomial in Fatigue model with exponential fitting approach,"© IMechE 2022.In this study, a new fatigue life prediction and optimization strategy utilizing the Failure Tensor Polynomial in Fatigue (FTPF) model with exponential fitting and numerical bisection method for fiber reinforced polymer composites has been proposed. Within the experimental stage, glass/epoxy composite laminates with (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.) lay-up configurations were fabricated, quasi-static and fatigue mechanical behavior of GFRP composites was characterized to be used in the FTPF model. The prediction capability of the FTPF model was tested based on the experimental data obtained for multidirectional laminates of various composite materials. Fatigue life prediction results of the glass/epoxy laminates were found to be better as compared to those for the linear fitting predictions. The results also indicated that the approach with exponential fitting provides better fatigue life predictions as compared to those obtained by linear fitting, especially for glass/epoxy laminates. Moreover, an optimization study using the proposed methodology for fatigue life advancement of the glass/epoxy laminates was performed by a powerful hybrid algorithm, PSA/GPSA. So, two optimization scenarios including various loading configurations were considered. The optimization results exhibited that the optimized stacking sequences having maximized fatigue life can be obtained in various loading cases. It was also revealed that the tension-compression loading and the loadings involving shear loads are critical for fatigue, and further improvement in fatigue life may be achieved by designing only symmetric lay-ups instead of symmetric-balanced and diversification of fiber angles to be used in the optimization.","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science",10.1177/09544062221101462
Tungsten carbide material tribology and circular economy relationship in polymer and composites industries,"© IMechE 2022.The implementation of the circular economy concept in industries demands experimental and innovative investigations. The set of strategies and paradigms that express the theoretical base of the circular economy plays a vital role in the enhancement of the quality and performance of polymer and composite materials. In this article, tungsten carbide material is advanced for tribological investigations. The scanning electron microscope and an optical and mechanical profilometer were used for the analysis of cotton polymer and tungsten carbide ball surfaces. A newly developed tribometry technique was introduced to investigate the coefficient of friction, wear, and deformation. The cotton surface was found damaged and rough. The tungsten carbide balls showed low roughness and higher hardness. The average surface roughness parameters Ra, Rz, and Rp of tungsten carbide balls were 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20, respectively. The average friction constant values were found to be 0.12–0.15 in the perpendicular direction and 0.11–0.17 in the parallel direction. Reciprocation distance increment has been used for industrial optimization. The coefficient of friction remained constant and slightly deformed cotton polymer. Based on the friction values, deformation, wear, and morphology evaluations, tungsten carbide ceramic materials could be used operationally for surface alterations of industrial machinery parts. The results could also enhance the quality and performance of polymer and composite products.","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications",10.1177/14644207221096929

Tribological behaviour of SiC and AL2O3 filled glass-epoxy composite,"© IMechE 2022.Metal glass fibre reinforced composites which are considered as advanced composite materials play a significant role in aerospace, marine and automotive industries. In the current study, an attempt has been made to examine the tribological characteristics of glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) composite filled with aluminium oxide (Al2O3) and silicon carbide (SiC) powder particles. Experiments were performed on pin-on-disc tribometer to evaluate the friction and wear rate as a function of normal load and sliding velocity under different conditions. For each composition of glass-epoxy composite filled with and without fillers, sliding tests were performed with normal load (20 N, 40 N, 60 N, 80 N 100 N) and sliding velocity (2.62 m/s, 4.18 m/s, 5.23 m/s, 6.85 m/s, 7.85 m/s) respectively. The metal GFRP composites were fabricated using hand-lay-up technique. The filler content (SiC & Al2O3) in epoxy-glass composite were varied. SiC was varied from 0 to 10% while Al2O3 was kept constant at 5%. To study the worn surface of glass-epoxy composite material scanning electronic microscopy is used. Before and after the experiment, weights of the composites (pin specimens) were studied on digital balance for wear loss. The present studies reported that the fabricated metal epoxy-fibre composite has performed excellent wear resistance when compared with epoxy-fibre composite without metal powders. The present work findings offer new insights into reinforcement in epoxy-glass composites with metal powders.","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part J: Journal of Engineering Tribology",10.1177/13506501221085543
Effect of TiO2 on the sinter crystallization of nepheline glasses for dental application,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society and Wiley Periodicals LLC.TiO2 is known to play a key role in the controlled crystallization of “bulk processed nepheline glasses”. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of adding TiO2 to a nepheline glass system made for powder processing to develop glass-ceramics for dental applications via the sinter-crystallization route. Three novel glass compositions based on the nepheline system were synthesized using the melt-quench method. Glasses were designed to contain 3.0 mole % TiO2, 6 mole % TiO2, and one glass made free of TiO2. Experimental glasses were ground into fine powders and then heat-treated at identical crystallization schedules. The addition of TiO2 hindered the densification process during the sinter-crystallization heat treatment. TiO2 free glass was found to sinter crystallize into a desirable material. In this study, the use of 3 mole % TiO2 and less was found to be effective in controlling the thermal properties without hindering the densification process during sinter crystallization.",International Journal of Applied Glass Science,10.1111/ijag.16564

Vickers microhardness (Hv) and Vickers indentation fracture toughness (KIC) of all the glass ceramics have been measured. UV–Visible spectroscopy study has been carried out for glass ceramics to investigate the optical properties. The glass ceramic with 1.5 mol % P2O5 has the highest transmittance. Glass ceramics with P2O5 ≥ 1 mol % having Li2Si2O5 (LS2) as main phase exhibit high Hv about 6.71–6.82 GPa which is suitable for dental and armor applications.",Silicon,10.1007/s12633-021-01610-6
"Radiation Shielding, EPR, and TL Mechanism in Cr3+: Ba(La)2SiO6 Glass Ceramics","© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.The current research aimed to prepare the Cr2O3 doped Ba(La)2SiO6 glasses and planned for elastic, radiation shielding, electron paramagnetic resonance, and thermoluminescence characterization. The X-Ray diffraction reports reveal the glassy behavior of the pure glass. At the same time, the other test samples show ceramic behavior. Mechanical properties of test samples reveal the range of the microhardness. DTA studies reveal the values of thermal studies of the test samples. After that, the glass-ceramics were tested for radiation shielding properties. The values of mass attenuation coefficient and radiation protection efficiency of the glasses are measured and compared with values obtained with the help of standard photon shielding and dosimetry software. The studies indicate that the glasses developed are capable of radiation shielding. The electron paramagnetic resonance reports suggest high dipole-dipole super-exchange interaction and rhombohedral distortion within the glasses. Furthermore, we have tested the glasses for radiation shielding properties. Upon 50 kGy, γ - irradiation, the thermoluminescence properties of the glasses are reported. The results were exciting and revealed that the resource developed is thermoluminescent at low activation energies. Additionally, the electron paramagnetic resonance and thermoluminescence properties obtained for the glasses are highly interlinked. In this view, to initiate the comprehensive link between electron paramagnetic resonance and thermoluminescence phenomenon, we have annealed the glasses under 0 to 300 °C of temperature and upon the 0 to 50 kGy, γ - irradiation dose level.",Silicon,10.1007/s12633-022-01731-6
Study on mechanical and tribological characteristics of layered functionally graded polymer composite materials,"© IMechE 2022.It is apparent that well-designed functionally graded materials (FGMs) exhibit smooth transition in properties. In this paper, polymer based functionally graded composite materials (FGCMs) were developed in combination with copper (Cu) particles and epoxy. A novel stepped layer configuration through a curing-phase approach at each layer in three different curing conditions (C1, C2, C3) have been processed. A significant enhancement in mechanical strength and erosion resistance was observed at higher curing temperatures (60°C) for sample C3. The results indicated tensile and compressive strengths of C3 enhanced by 40.20%, 17.48% and 20.18%, 9.74% compared to C1 and C2, respectively. Furthermore, when the FGM is loaded from top to bottom (T-B), there is an enhancement in flexural strength of C3 by 7.88% when compared to bottom to top (B-T) loading. In addition, the erosion wear of C3 was found to be lowest of all the samples.","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part E: Journal of Process Mechanical Engineering",10.1177/09544089221074841
Zinc Stannate (Zn2SnO4)-Based Hybrid Composite Photoanode for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell Application,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Improving the power conversation efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has become a challenge and a matter of interest for researchers. Designing a simple device structure with better performance by a cost-effective fabrication technique is essential for photovoltaic technology. This study emphasizes an alternative hybrid composite photoanode material for the DSSC devices. Pristine Zn2SnO4and Zn2SnO4-SnO2and Zn2SnO4-ZnO composites were synthesized by facile solid-state calcination to prepare the photoanode for DSSCs. The structural, surface morphological, optical, and band structural properties of the synthesized samples were studied. An attempt has been made to correlate the power conversion efficiency of the fabricated devices with the investigated properties. The X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the presence of multiphases that depend on the stoichiometric ratio of precursor materials. The surface morphology analysis reveals that the Zn2SnO4-SnO2and Zn2SnO4-ZnO composites exhibit microsheet and microrod structures, respectively. The composite materials show a higher amount of dye loading, leading to better performance than the pristine Zn2SnO4sample. A better band matching of the synthesized composite materials with other layers provides a higher carrier density. The composite photoanodes exhibit higher efficiency (6.26% for Zn2SnO4-SnO2and 4.48% for Zn2SnO4-ZnO) than the pristine Zn2SnO4photoanode (3.76%). The results indicate that the Zn2SnO4-based composites can be potential materials for photoanode applications.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.2c01981

A study of the solidification and stability mechanisms of heavy metals in electrolytic manganese slag-based glass-ceramics,"Copyright © 2022 Wang, Han, Yang, Xing and Liu.To better solve the waste pollution problem generated by the electrolytic manganese industry, electrolytic manganese slag as the main raw material, chromium iron slag, and pure chemical reagents containing heavy metal elements mixed with electrolytic manganese slag doping. A parent glass was formed by melting the slag mixture at 1,250°C, which was, thereafter, heat-treated at 900°C to obtain the glass-ceramic. The results from characterizations showed that the heavy metal elements in the glass-ceramic system were well solidified and isolated, with a leakage concentration at a relatively low level. After crystallization, the curing rates of harmful heavy metals all exceed 99.9%. The mechanisms of heavy metal migration, transformation, and solidification/isolation in glass-ceramic curing bodies were investigated by using characterization methods such as chemical elemental morphological analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and electron microprobe. The most toxic Cr and Mn elements were found to be mainly kept in their residual state in the glass-ceramic system. It was concluded that the curing mechanism of the heavy metals in a glass-ceramic can either be explained by the chemical curing induced by bonding (or interaction) during phase formation, or by physical encapsulation. Characterization by using both Transmission electron microscopy and EPMA confirmed that Cr and Mn were mainly present in the newly formed spinel phase, while the diopside phase contained a small amount of Mn. Zn, Cd, and Pb are not found to be concentrated and uniformly dispersed in the system, which is speculated to be physical coating and curing.",Frontiers in Chemistry,10.3389/fchem.2022.989087
Microstructural Control of CaO-Al2O3-SiO2Glass Ceramics by Oxidation and Mixing with Nucleation Agents,"© 2022 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.Microstructural control of CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 (CAS) glass ceramics (GCs) was achieved by oxidation and mixing with nucleation agents. CAS GCs were precipitated with hexagonal platy particles of metastable CaAl2Si2O8 layered crystals (CAS GC-H), which are typically prepared under a reductive atmosphere that forms metallic Mo or W particles as nucleation agents. The average particle size of crystals decreased significantly from 50 to 11 μm when the CAS GC-H containing metallic W particles was prepared under an oxidative atmosphere. Compared to this CAS-GC-H, the crystal particle size increased from 8-20 to 10-30 μm when the CAS GC-H was prepared by mixing glass cullet containing metallic Mo and that containing metallic W particles. These results indicate that one microstructure of CAS GC-H is controlled on the micrometer scale from a parent glass with one composition by varying the experimental conditions related to the glass melting state.",ACS Omega,10.1021/acsomega.2c03799
Effect of coconut shell nanopowder reinforcement in the development of palm fiber composites,"Copyright © 2022 Raja Dhas, Savio Lewise, Kumar, Raja, AL-bonsrulah, Ahmad, Yao and Al-Bahrani.Lightweight materials are being employed in aeronautical and automobile industries for high strength, lower weight, and energy consumption. Attention is needed to control pollution through the usage of harmful synthetic composites globally. In this work, coconut shell nanofillers are reinforced in the development of various palm fiber (leaf stalk, leaf sheath, leaf-spine, and fruit) composites using the hand layup technique. Mechanical and morphological effects of the addition of nano-coconut-shell-powder to the composites are addressed. The palm fibers are sandwiched within the glass fiber to improve the strength of composites. The addition of coconut shell nanoparticles in the composites improves the tensile, flexural, impact, hardness, and water absorption characteristics. SEM image observations on the composite indicate the buildup of nanomodified matrix residues around the fiber bundle. The adhesive property of the composite is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy examination, which reveals the presence of one additional alcohol/phenol OH stretch, one less alkyl CH stretch, and aromatic CH bending functional groups. The inclusion of palm fibers during the fabrication of composites facilitated the pushing of curves to higher temperatures with considerable degradation temperatures, thereby increasing thermal stability and making them suitable for thermal applications. Development of the eco-composite changes environmental impact factors aiming sustainability.",Frontiers in Materials,10.3389/fmats.2022.986011
Co-vitrification of municipal solid waste incinerator fly ash and bottom slag: Glass detoxifying characteristics and porous reformation,"© 2022 The AuthorsSafety and efficient dispose of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash with high toxicity has emerged as a worldwide challenge. Vitrification provides the advantages of capacity reduction, detoxification, and solidification of heavy metals, which has the potential to dispose of hazardous waste on a large scale. Herein, co–vitrification of MSWI fly ash and bottom slag has been accomplished based on the characteristics of calcium and silicon composition. A novel approach for producing glass ceramic foams by alkaline activation–crystallization was developed to realize the disposal of the obtained glass. The effect of MSWI fly ash/bottom slag ratios on the glass network, crystallization ability of the basic glass, pore structure, and physical properties of the porous green body was investigated. The results revealed that with increasing MSWI fly ash proportion, the Si–O of [SiO4] in the basic glass changed significantly and the crystallization ability steadily reduced. Si–O and Al–O in basic glass are easy to corrode under alkaline conditions, releasing Ca2+ and forming a low solubility product, calcium silicate hydrate. When the crystallization temperature increases from 950 ℃ to 1150 ℃, it is more conducive to the precipitation of the gehlenite phase. Extending the crystallization time promotes three–dimensional growth of crystals that are coupled with each other to form a network structure and a multi–stage pore structure. The pore structure was developed with the help of NH3 and H2 generated by the secondary aluminum ash (SAA). Through the preparation of glass ceramic foams, the raw materials were detoxified. The toxic heavy metals showed extremely low leaching concentrations, which were smaller than the limit of TCLP. The prepared samples had 70.22–80.61% of porosity, 0.78–1.19 g/cm3 of low bulk density, and 0.54–7.86 MPa of compressive strength.",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113995
Composite material incorporating protective coatings for photovoltaic cell encapsulation,"© 2022Photovoltaic modules consisting of one back-contact cell were manufactured by vacuum resin infusion process using glass reinforced epoxy composite as encapsulant where the cells are embedded. Incorporation of three coatings onto the composite surface was studied with the aim to improve the electrical performance stability of the modules under ultraviolet (UV), thermal cycling and damp-heat environmental weathering. Photovoltaic and aging performance were examined through the short-circuit current density values and colour change of the composite. Decrease in the initial photovoltaic performance of the modules was caused by the coating deposition. The highest drop in the initial values was observed for the varnish type coating, showing a decrease of 2.6% in short-circuit current. Regarding the performance stability, the decrease was more pronounced in the damp-heat test, presenting the varnish type coating the minimum loss of 1.4% in short-circuit current and a variation of 87% in b* chromatic parameter after 1000 h exposure at 85 °C and 85% relative humidity. The study concluded that the protective coating should be selected to provide the composite modules with an optimal trade-off between the initial electrical performance and the desired stability, with further research work targeted to improve moisture barrier properties.",Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells,10.1016/j.solmat.2022.111879
Effects of methane steam reforming on the mechanical stability of solid oxide fuel cell stack,"© 2022Thermal stress-induced mechanical failure is a critical issue for practical application of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Due to the lack of study on the thermo-mechanical behavior of SOFC with different methane steam pre-reforming ratios (R), a 3D thermo-mechanical model is developed to systematically evaluate the mechanical performance of SOFC running on methane fuel. The model fully considers the coupled transport and reaction processes in the SOFC. The numerically obtained temperature is imported to a mechanical sub-model to determine the thermal stress and strain of SOFC components under various operating conditions, namely with different R values. Covering all R conditions, glass–ceramic sealant is the most dangerous component, while cathode is in sub-critical state. When R < 0.4, the electrolyte has the minimum failure probability. When R > 0.4, the anode becomes the safest component in SOFC stack. With the increase of R, the failure probability of anode decreases all the way and always stays in the safe range, while first decreases then increases for electrolyte, cathode and sealant. R within range of 0.4–0.7 is favorable for the reliability of the whole SOFC stack. This study is useful for identifying optimal operating conditions for efficient and stable operation of SOFC running on alternative hydrocarbon fuels.",Applied Energy,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119464
Novel environmental radiation dosimeter—Mn:CaF2 transparent glass ceramic: Dependence of thermoluminescence performance on slag addition and crystallisation behaviour,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.A new thermoluminescence (TL) material, Mn:CaF2 transparent glass ceramic, was prepared from silicomanganese slag, and its feasibility as thermoluminescence dosimeter (TLD) for environmental radiation dose detection was verified for the first time. When added 19.28 wt% slag and heat-treated at 710 °C, the samples showed better sensitivity to absorbed radiation, along with a linear dose response characteristic ranging from 50 to 500 Gy. Moreover, the irradiated samples should be stored in dark environment for less than 40 days. The reproducibility of glow curves could be achieved after annealing at 300 °C for 20 min before the next irradiation. Finally, the kinetic parameters were calculated and the glow mechanism was clarified. The results indicate show that the new TL material, Mn:CaF2 transparent glass ceramic prepared using silicomanganese slag, is a potential candidate for radiation detection applications, which also provides a new and valuable approach for the resource utilisation of silicomanganese slag.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.027
Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study on the influence of La2O3 on the melt structure of SiO2–CaO–Al2O3–MgO,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.In order to gain more insights into the influence of rare earth elements on the melt structure of SiO2–CaO–Al2O3–MgO glass ceramics, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques were used to study the influence of La2O3 on the Si–O/Al–O tetrahedron structure within SiO2–CaO–Al2O3–MgO–quenched glass samples in this study. Results showed that some Raman peak shapes at low frequencies (200–840 cm−1) changed significantly after the addition of La2O3, compared to the high frequency (840–1200 cm−1) region that corresponds to the [SiO4] structure, suggesting that the depolymerization of the low-frequency T–O–T (T=Si or Al) structure was more prevalent with La3+ addition. Besides, the depolymerization extent of the Si–O/Al–O tetrahedral network varied when the melt composition altered. Most notably, depolymerization is the most significant at a low CaO/SiO2 ratio (0.25) and a high Al2O3 content (8%). Meanwhile, La3+ can promote the transformation of Si–O–Si and Al–O–Al bonds to the Si–O–Al ones, thereby forming a complex ionic cluster network interwoven with Si–O and Al–O tetrahedrons.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.270
"Preparation, crystallization kinetics and stabilization behavior of the heavy metal ions of all-solid waste-based glass-ceramics from steel slag and coal gangue","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, all solid waste-based glass-ceramics with 55% steel slag and 45% coal gangue were prepared by the conventional melt-quenching and two-step heat treatment methods. The effect of the heat treatment on the crystallization, microstructure, physical properties and stabilization behavior of the heavy metal ions for the glass-ceramics was researched by DSC, XRD, SEM and ICP-OES. Augite was the dominant crystal phase with a crystallinity about 94%. With a heat treatment of 750°C/6 h+900°C/2h, the flexural strength (328 MPa) and Vickers hardness (9.59 GPa) of the prepared glass-ceramic reached the optimal. The immobilization efficiencies of the glass-ceramics for the heavy metal ions almost reached above 90%. The above results suggest that the use of all-solid waste for the preparation of glass-ceramics may be a feasible way to achieve the immobilization of heavy metal ions.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121750
"Effect of MnO content on the crystallization, physicochemical and dielectric properties of mica glass-ceramics","© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.This paper has concentrated on the effect of partial substitution of MnO for MgO on the crystallization, physicochemical and dielectric properties of mica glass-ceramics. The results showed that MnO acted as a network modifier to diminish the network integrity. Fluorphlogopite (KMg3(Si3AlO10) F2) phase, as the dominant crystal phase, suggested that Mn2+ ions did not participate in forming the mica phase. The crystallinity achieved the maximum (67.96%) at a MnO doping of 4 mol%. From SEM images, the conclusion that appropriate MnO doping could promote the formation of nuclei and refine the grains can be obtained. When the doping of MnO was 4 mol%, the Vickers hardness (4.59 GPa) of mica glass-ceramics was the lowest, while the bending strength (136.84 MPa) and chemical stability reached the best. The dielectric constant was about 7–8 at 1 MHz, and the dielectric loss remained relatively low.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.368

In recent decades, several types of SE with high ionic conductivity have been developed and tested with different techniques. In this study, we employed a non-destructive nuclear analytical method, Neutron Depth Profiling (NDP), to investigate the response of one of the promising electrolytes, Lithium Conductive Glass Ceramic (LICGC), to the applied voltage +2.8 V. The in-situ NDP measurements made it possible to directly monitor the migration of lithium ions in the electrolyte and to observe and quantify the formation of a space charge layer with depleted Li atoms, which depends on the biasing time.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231719
Diopside glass-ceramics were fabricated by sintering the powder mixtures of waste glass and kaolin,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Glass-ceramics with diopside (CaMgSi2O6) as the main crystalline phase were prepared via low-temperature powder sintering method using waste glass and kaolin as starting materials. The effects of kaolin content and sintering temperature on phase composition, micro-structure and properties of as-prepared glass-ceramics were investigated by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Research results showed that the addition of kaolin could promote the devitrification of waste glass during sintering. The formation of diopside crystalline phase mainly originated from the decrease of sodium ion contents in glass phase, which was caused by the crystallization of sodium aluminum silicate. Diopside-based glass-ceramics could be achieved under proper combination ratio of waste glass and kaolin, and raising sintering temperature was beneficial to formation of diopside. Glass-ceramics prepared by adding 25 wt% kaolin and sintered at 825 °C for 2 h showed a maximum bending strength of 114.9 MPa and a bulk density of 2.484 g/cm3.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.020
Coupled effect of self-healing granules and permeable crystalline additive on early-age cracks repair in cement material,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Cement-based materials are prone to cracks that affect their strength and durability. The service life of these materials can be extended through development of self-healing cement-based materials. This study independently designed and produced self-healing granules and explored the synergistic effects of using self-healing granules and permeable crystalline additive. The self-healing efficiency is evaluated via crack closure and the compressive strength recovery rate. The porosity and crack healing products were analyzed to discuss the self-healing mechanisms, revealing that the reaction of the granule inner core with cement precipitates can heal the cracks up to approximately 1 mm after the self-healing granules are ruptured, and permeable crystalline additives can greatly increase the compressive strength recovery rate by closing the microcracks/pores. Self-healing granules and permeable crystalline additives allow for the repair of microcracks and visible cracks in specimens, realizing self-healing at the macro- and micro-scale. These results provide promising self-healing cement-based materials and a novel research direction.",Materials Letters,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.132560
New insights into the formation mechanism of zircon in a ZrO2–SiO2 nanocrystalline glass-ceramic: A TEM study,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.We have previously observed that doping of Ca ions was beneficial to the formation of zircon (ZrSiO4). It is well known that synthetic ZrSiO4 is typically formed via a solid-state reaction between ZrO2 and SiO2, in which the interfaces between the reactant and resultant play an important role. However, the interfaces are lacking detailed microstructural observation. This follow-up study aims at exploring the formation mechanism of ZrSiO4 by inspecting the interfaces at the nano and atomic scales with TEM techniques. Results demonstrated that ZrSiO4 was formed in the Ca-doped sample after sintering at 1200 °C, whereas, no ZrSiO4 was formed in the undoped sample even after sintering at 1230 °C. The Ca-doped sample consisted of a continuous ZrSiO4 matrix with dispersed ZrO2 nanocrystallites. Doping of Ca ions promoted the formation of ZrSiO4 by causing lattice distortion and oxygen vacancies in ZrO2 lattices. Thin amorphous grain boundary complexions were found between ZrO2 nanocrystallites and between ZrO2 and ZrSiO4 crystallites. These amorphous complexions acted as reaction sites and an intermediate metastable state for the solid-state reaction. A detailed formation mechanism of ZrSiO4 at the nanometer scale and atomic scale has been proposed.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.021
"Preparation, characterization, and physicomechanical properties of glass-ceramic foams based on alkali-activation and sintering of zeolite-poor rock and eggshell","© 2022 The Author(s)This study reports the fabrication of novel glass-ceramic foams for thermal insulation to minimize the energy consumption in the buildings. Different combinations of zeolite-poor rock/eggshell powders (with eggshell content varying from 0 to 20 wt%) have been used to produce the foams through alkali-activation and reactive sintering techniques. The produced glass-ceramic foams were characterized based on their structural, thermal, and mechanical characteristics. The heat treatment process and the foaming patterns are examined by a heating microscope, and the findings reveal an excellent foamability of the utilized alkali-activated mixture in the range of 800–950 °C. The microstructure and the pore size of the acquired foams are investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and computed tomography (CT) analysis. The crystallinity and phase composition of the prepared samples were investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD). The experiment findings reveal that raising the eggshell content is favorable to gas production, but it affects the liquid phase creation resulting in inconsistent pore size distribution. The appropriate eggshell content is 4%, and the optimal heat treatment temperature is 900 °C. The produced ceramic foams possess a density ranging from 0.54 to 1 g/cm3, thermal conductivity around 0.07–0.4 W/mK, and compressive strength values between 1.2 and 6.7 MPa. The results indicate that the ceramic foams created could be a feasible choice for applications in constriction as thermal insulation materials.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.267
High-temperature damage-tolerance of a hot-rolled brick-and-mortar Ti2Ni/TiNi composite,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A nacre-like biomimetic Ti2Ni/TiNi brick-and-mortar composite, consisting of brittle Ti2Ni bricks homogeneously distributed in ductile TiNi mortars, is produced by hot rolling conventional laminated composite. When deformation temperature is between 25 and 500 °C, the brick-and-mortar composite essentially remains constants of fracture toughness (50 MPa·m1/2) and flexural strength (1250 MPa). This is consistent with zig-zag crack trajectories inherited from the nacre-like structure, providing a strong extrinsic toughening. Further increasing the deformation temperature up to 700 °C dramatically deteriorates the flexural strength because the TiNi mortars are strongly softened. Therefore, the Ti2Ni/TiNi brick-and-mortar composite exhibits a high-temperature damage-tolerance up to 500 °C.",Materials Letters,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.132555
Effect of heat treatment on the roughness and mechanical properties of dental lithium disilicate glass-ceramics,"© 2022In dental clinics, it is common to perform small fitting adjustments in dentures using a micro-grinding tool after testing them in the patient's mouth. This procedure increases local roughness and can lead to formation of microcracks on the prosthesis surface. This study aimed to investigate the benefits of a post-finishing heat treatment to surface roughness and crack healing and its effect on the flexural strength of lithium disilicate (LD) dental glass-ceramics. Commercially available lithium metasilicate, Li2SiO3, samples were heat treated at 840 °C for 7 min to induce the phase transformation into LD, Li2Si2O5. The LD samples were characterized by X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Vickers hardness, Young's modulus, and fracture toughness. One of the surfaces of the LD samples was sanded aiming to simulate the denture fitting adjustments performed in the dentist's laboratory, generating a rough surface, Group 1. Half of the LD samples had their biaxial flexural strength evaluated by the piston-on-three-ball test (P–3B) and the other half were submitted to a second short-term heat treatment (840 °C - 5 min), Group 2, and later assessed by the P–3B. Roughness parameters in both groups were measured by 3D optical profilometry. After the crystallization heat treatment, formation of elongated LD crystals, Li2Si2O5, 35% amorphous phase, and residual Li3PO4 was observed. In addition, the following mechanical property values were obtained: Vickers hardness = 5.8 ± 0.1 GPa, fracture toughness = 2.2 ± 0.1 MPa m1/2, and Young's modulus = 100.3 ± 0.3 GPa. The samples in Group 1 showed bending strength of 206 ± 30 MPa and the following roughness parameters: Ra = 0.45 ± 0.16 μm, Rz = 22.7 ± 6.7 μm, and PV = 27.7 ± 7.1 μm. In the samples in Group 2, the Ra, Rz and PV roughness parameters were 0.31 ± 0.12 μm, 5.2 ± 2.5 μm, and 9.2 ± 4.7 μm, respectively. With this decrease in roughness, the bending strength increased by 62%, with a mean value of 331 ± 59 MPa. In the need for machine finishing of LD-based glass-ceramic dental prostheses, the use of a second short-term heat treatment at 840 °C for 5 min generates considerable gains in bending strength, increasing the lifecycle of the prosthesis as a result of reduced surface roughness caused by softening of the remaining amorphous phase in the glass-ceramic. These conditions can be adapted to each chemical and crystallographic composition of the glass-ceramic under study.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.314
In situ synthesis of 3D metal oxides/Ni3C on the macroporous electrically conductive network for enhanced electron field emission,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Three-dimensional metal oxides/Ni3C structures (TiO2/Ni3C, CuO/Ni3C, and WO3/Ni3C) are prepared in situ on the macroporous electrically conductive network (MECN) and the field emission (FE) characteristics are investigated systematically. The TiO2/Ni3C nanosheets deposited on MECN show the smallest turn-on and threshold fields of 1.30 V/μm and 1.69 V/μm, respectively, compared to CuO/Ni3C and WO3/Ni3C. The excellent FE properties of TiO2/Ni3C/MECN arise from the low work function and change in hybridization from sp2 to sp3 carbon atoms at the electron emission sites. In situ synthesis of TiO2/Ni3C is environmentally friendly, efficient, and compatible with microelectronics manufacturing boding well for application to high-performance FE and vacuum nanodevices.",Materials Letters,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.132524
"Modification of crystallization behavior, mechanical strength and optical property of Ge–S binary chalcogenide glass ceramics by trace CsCl incorporation","© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.In present work, we discovered that nano-crystallization behavior of Ge–S binary chalcogenide glass can be remarkably improved by incorporating trace amount of CsCl as nucleating agent. After implementing an annealing process, the resultant Ge-S-CsCl chalcogenide glass ceramics (GSC ChGCs) possess fine distribution of crystallites belonging to GeS2 and GeS mixture phase which could enhance mechanical strength and narrow bandgap energy of the original glass. By utilizing femtosecond Z-scan method, nonlinear optical properties of the GSC ChGCs were investigated in a spectral range from 750 to 900 nm. The results showed that the nonlinear absorption attribute of the GSC ChGCs can be enhanced by the crystallinity increase which led to the maximum two-photon absorption coefficient of 19.57 cm/GW at excitation wavelength of 750 nm, increased by 78% as compared to the original glass.

In this study, mesoporous bioactive glass-ceramics doped with different amounts of vanadium and iron ((60−(x + y)) SiO2-36CaO-4P2O5-xV2O5-yFe2O3, x and y between 0, 5 and, 10 mole%) were synthesized using a sol-gel method. Then, their effects on particle morphology and the biomineralization process were examined in simulated body fluid (SBF). N2 adsorption isotherm analysis proved that the samples have a mesoporous structure. In addition, the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the samples after soaking in SBF for various periods (7, 14, and 21 days) confirmed the presence of new chemical bonds related to the apatite phase, which is in accordance with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples after SBF soaking showed that lower amounts of vanadium and iron were associated with the formation of a stable and more crystalline phase of hydroxyapatite. The MTT results showed that the cell viability of mesoporous bioactive glass containing 5% V2O5 remains more than 90% over 7 days, which indicates the biocompatibility of the samples. To conclude, further studies on these formulations are going to be carried out in future investigations for chemohyperthermia application.",RSC Advances,10.1039/d2ra04786a
Transparent fluoride glass-ceramics with phase-selective crystallization for middle IR photonics,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Crystallization in glass is a fundamental topic in materials science, yielding the beauty and richness of crystals in glass for broad applications. However, controlling the crystallization in fluoride glasses remains a challenge owing to their low glass-forming ability. We fabricate transparent fluoroindate glass-ceramics (FGCs) with phase-selective crystallization (SrF2, CaF2 and MgF2) by a general one-step strategy. The alkaline-earth cations with high field strength are utilized to engineer the phase separation which induce subsequent phase-selective crystallization. The ab initio molecular dynamics revealed the heterogeneous distribution of Sr/Y-F regions and diverse diffusion rates of different elements in fluoride glass melt, providing fundamental insights into phase-separation at the atomic scale. Rapid quenching is employed to regulate the crystal growth in spontaneous crystallization during the cooling stage. The crystal morphology, element distribution, lattice parameters and simulated atomic structure in FGCs further elucidate the phase-separation mechanism, thermodynamics and kinetics in rapid quenching. The new FGCs manifest enhanced mechanical and chemical stability and do not sacrifice the excellent optical performance compared to the parent fluoroindate glass. Numerous optical applications with superior properties in MIR photonics have been demonstrated. This sets the stage for phase-separation chemistry to yield a diverse selection of desired crystals precipitated from fluoride glass.",Journal of Materials Chemistry C,10.1039/d2tc02627a
Recycling of granite powder and waste marble produced from stone processing for the preparation of architectural glass–ceramic,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdA large amount of solid waste is generated during the stone processing, and a serious environmental issues has arisen from the accumulation of these wastes. In this work, granite powder and waste marble are used to prepare architectural glass–ceramic. The mechanical properties, microstructure, and acid resistance of glass-ceramics designed with different compositions were investigated. With the increase of waste marble content, the main crystalline phase of glass–ceramic changed from anorthite to wollastonite, and the flexural strength of glass–ceramic was also enhanced. When the mass ratio of granite powder to waste marble is 40:60, a CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 (CAS) glass–ceramic with a flexural strength of 109.33 MPa and a Vickers hardness of 6.61 GPa is obtained. After the addition of MgO, the main crystalline phase of the glass–ceramic is augite. Under the addition of 5 wt% MgO, the flexural strength and Vickers hardness of CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (CMAS) glass–ceramic reached the maximum, which are 146.95 MPa and 10.24 GPa, respectively. The mechanical properties of these two types of glass-ceramics developed from granite powder and waste marble can meet the requirements of building materials. From the acid resistance test results, it was found that the higher the content of MgO and CaO in the chemical composition of glass–ceramic, the worse the acid resistance. Therefore, the basic oxide content should be carefully controlled in the composition design of glass–ceramic. This technology of converting granite powder and waste marble into value-added glass–ceramic provides a promising method for the utilization of solid waste from stone processing, which can greatly improve the sustainability of the stone industry.",Construction and Building Materials,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.128408
Associated Synthesis of Microgranular Foam-Glass-Ceramic from Diatomaceous Shales,"© 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The technology for synthesizing porous microgranular material based on diatomaceous shale is considered. The process of foaming microgranules was conducted in an industrial roaster furnace along with the production of granulated foam-glass ceramic of large fractions. The main properties of microgranular foam-glass ceramic samples were studied as functions of the content of NaOH in the batch, as a result of which its composition was optimized to obtain 75 μm particles and a minimal content of particles sinking in water. An aspect of the porous structure of microgranular foam-glass ceramic makes it possible to obtain stronger lightweight grouting mortar in comparison with the customary additive. These investigations extend the range of foam-glass ceramic materials and the raw material base due to the more accessible deposits of diatomaceous shale for development in the Arctic regions.",Glass and Ceramics (English translation of Steklo i Keramika),10.1007/s10717-022-00491-4
Crystallization Aspects of Lithium Aluminosilicate Glass Microspheres Produced in High-Temperature Plasma Flow,"© 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The influence of the spheroidization process occurring in 1.0 mol.% Nd2O3 doped Li2O–Al2O3–SiO2 (LAS) glass in a high-temperature plasma flow on the properties of glass crystallization was investigated. The resulting 32 – 64 μm microspheres are characterized by a significantly higher glass transition temperature Tg compared to that of the original glass, which could be associated with both a change in the chemical composition on spheroidization and a fundamentally different thermal history of the microspheres and glass. In spite of the moderation of the crystallization kinetics, in microspheres as well as in the original glass, under the influence of heat treatment, a glass-ceramic structure is formed based on â-eucryptite-like solid solutions LixAlxSi1–xO2, indicating the possibility of obtaining microspheres with glass-ceramic structure as well as varying their linear thermal expansion coefficient near zero values.",Glass and Ceramics (English translation of Steklo i Keramika),10.1007/s10717-022-00476-3
Effect of Sandblasting with Fluorapatite Glass-ceramic Powder and Chemical Primers/Adhesives on Shear Bond Strength of Indirect Repairing Composite to Zirconia,"©Operative Dentistry, 2022.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of sandblasting with fluorapatite glass-ceramic (FGC) powder on zirconia surface roughness, crystallinity, and shear bond strength (SBS) of indirect repairing composite to zirconia using different primers/adhesives. METHODS: Zirconia blocks were treated as follows: no treatment (control group), blasting with 30-μm silica-coated alumina (CoJet group), and blasting with FGC powder (FGC group). The surface topography, silica content, roughness, and crystallinity of treated zirconia surfaces were analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), an optical profilometer, and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Four primers/adhesives (Monobond Plus, Calibra Silane, Futurabond M+, and Scotchbond Universal) were compared to bond precured resin composite to zirconia groups using Multilink Automix resin cement. Bonded specimens were thermocycled for 10,000 cycles and tested in SBS and the modes of failure were recorded. The effect of different surface treatments and primers/adhesives on SBS results were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc tests (α=0.05). RESULTS: Both CoJet and FGC groups showed rough surfaces with a higher content of silica in FGC, but less monoclinic crystals, compared to the CoJet group. The highest mean SBS was found in the FGC group treated with Monobond Plus compared to CoJet and Control groups. Adhesive failure was predominant in control groups, while combined failure was found in the CoJet and FGC groups regardless of the primers/adhesives employed. CONCLUSION: Sandblasting zirconia with FGC powder increased SBS of resin composite to zirconia with lower monoclinic phase transformation compared to CoJet sand. Monobond Plus reported the highest means of SBS values compared to other primers/adhesives.",Operative dentistry,10.2341/21-108-L
Influence of Surface Conditioning on Bonding Polyetherketoneketone to Dental Ceramic,"© 2022 The Electrochemical Society (“ECS”). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.This study researched the effects of different surface conditioning techniques on the bond strength of polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) with lithium disilicate glass-ceramic material. Total of 105 test specimens were prepared from PEKK discs and randomly distributed into 5 experimental groups (n = 21) to which different surface conditioning techniques were applied. [Group A: sandblasting + SR Connect adhesive agent (SRC), Group B: dichloromethane (DCM) + SRC, Group C: methyl methacrylate (MMA) and DCM mixture + SRC, Group D: sandblasting + DCM + SRC, Group E (control): sandblasting + Pekk Bond adhesive agent (PB).] Surface roughness values of PEKK test specimens were measured. They were bonded to lithium disilicate glass-ceramic test specimens with resin cement. Half of them were subjected to thermomechanical aging. Shear bond strength measurements were made. Among the A, B, C, D, and E groups, a statistically significant difference was observed in terms of the surface roughness values (p < 0.001). Statistically significant differences were obtained among the thermomechanical aging groups (p < 0.001) and among the non-thermomechanical aging groups (p = 0.012) in terms of shear bond strength. Group D and Group E demonstrated clinically acceptable bond strength values when bonding PEKK material with lithium disilicate glass-ceramic material.",ECS Journal of Solid State Science and Technology,10.1149/2162-8777/ac91a5
Distortion of an LTCC Bilayer during Constrained Sintering: Comparison between Ombroscopic Imaging and Modeling,"© 2022 by the authors.A complete methodology combining experiments and modeling has been developed to investigate the constrained sintering of low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) systems. The thermomechanical and sintering behavior laws, previously identified for the selected commercial LTCC material, were implemented in a finite element model. The reliability and validity range of the built model has been investigated thanks to the development of a specific distortion experience. The distortion generated during the constrained sintering of a porous LTCC layer deposited on a dense one has been monitored in situ by ombroscopy. The measured camber evolution was compared with numerical results. The camber phenomena predicted numerically and observed experimentally are very similar, characterized by the onset of distortion around 918 K and a similar evolution during heating. However, at high temperatures (around 1100 K), the simulated camber slightly differs from the experimental one. It seems to be related to the damage to the dense LTCC layer by microcracking.",Materials,10.3390/ma15186405
Radiopaque Glass Ceramic with Calcium Tantalate Microcrystals for the Treatment of Malignant Neoplasms,"© 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.Abstract: In order to expand the list of materials suitable for the treatment of malignant neoplasms, a composite glass-ceramic has been obtained, consisting of calcium tantalate microcrystals enclosed in a glass matrix. The material has been studied in vivo. The composite is a radiomodifier; it improves the visualization of the irradiation zone, does not pose a threat of radioactive contamination of the body, and reduces the likelihood of radiation complications in healthy tissues. It has been established that due to the two-phase composition of glass ceramics, CaTa2O6 microcrystals are able to linger in tissues at the injection site and provide more effective radiation therapy. The radiosensitization properties of the material increase the efficiency of a single dose of radiation. The created glass ceramics is a promising material for the treatment of patients in need of radiotherapy.",Russian Journal of Inorganic Chemistry,10.1134/S0036023622090091
A Review on Risk Management of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) Infection in Dental Practice: Focus on Prosthodontics and All-Ceramic Materials,"© 2022 by the authors.Background: A novel β-coronavirus infection (COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan city, spreading rapidly to other countries and leading to a pandemic. Dental professionals and patients are exposed to a high risk of COVID-19 infection, particularly in the prosthodontic practice, because of the bio-aerosol produced during teeth preparation with dental handpieces and the strict contact with oral fluids during impression making. This paper aimed to provide an overview to limit the risk of transmission of COVID-19 infections during prosthetic procedures in dental offices. Methods: An electronic search was conducted on the electronic databases of PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, Embase, Scopus, Dynamed, and Open Grey with the following queries: (COVID-19) AND/OR (SARS-CoV-2) AND/OR (Coronavirus) AND/OR (contaminated surface) AND/OR (cross-infection) AND/OR (Prosthodontics) AND/OR (dental ceramic) AND/OR (glass-ceramic). A manual search was performed as well. Results: From the 1023 collected records, 32 papers were included. Conclusions: Dental offices are at high risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the close contact with patients and continuous exposure to saliva during dental procedures. Therefore, pre-check triages via telephone, decontamination, the disinfection of impressions, the sterilization of scanner tips, and the use of specific personal protective equipment, dental high-speed handpieces with dedicated anti-retraction valves, and effective mouthwashes are strongly recommended.",Prosthesis,10.3390/prosthesis4030028
Mechanical Properties and In Vitro Biocompatibility of Hybrid Polymer-HA/BAG Ceramic Dental Materials,"© 2022 by the authors.The aim of this study is to prepare hybrid polymer–ceramic dental materials for chairside computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications. The hybrid polymer–ceramic materials were fabricated via infiltrating polymerizable monomer mixtures into sintered hydroxyapatite/bioactive glass (HA/BAG) ceramic blocks and thermo-curing. The microstructure was observed by scanning electron microscopy and an energy-dispersive spectrometer. The phase structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The composition ratio was analyzed by a thermogravimetric analyzer. The hardness was measured by a Vickers hardness tester. The flexural strength, flexural modulus, and compressive strength were measured and calculated by a universal testing machine. The growth of human gingival fibroblasts was evaluated by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay and immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that the sintering temperature and BAG content affected the mechanical properties of the hybrid polymer–ceramic materials. The X-ray diffraction analysis showed that high-temperature sintering promoted the partial conversion of HA to β-tricalcium phosphate. The values of the hardness, flexural strength, flexural modulus, and compressive strength of all the hybrid polymer–ceramic materials were 0.89–3.51 GPa, 57.61–118.05 MPa, 20.26–39.77 GPa, and 60.36–390.46 MPa, respectively. The mechanical properties of the hybrid polymer–ceramic materials were similar to natural teeth. As a trade-off between flexural strength and hardness, hybrid polymer–ceramic material with 20 wt.% BAG sintered at 1000 °C was the best material. In vitro experiments confirmed the biocompatibility of the hybrid polymer–ceramic material. Therefore, the hybrid polymer–ceramic material is expected to become a new type of dental restoration material.",Polymers,10.3390/polym14183774
Low-Temperature Sintering of a New Bioactive Glass Enriched with Magnesium Oxide and Strontium Oxide,"© 2022 by the authors.The recent research on bioactive glasses (BGs) has mainly moved on two fronts: (1) introducing ions of therapeutic interest in their composition and (2) the development of scaffolds, fibers, coatings and sintered products starting from BGs in powder form. In this case, the main obstacle to overcome is that BGs rapidly crystallize during heat treatments, thus transforming into glass-ceramics with low reactivity, slow ion release and, eventually, poor mechanical properties. Here an innovative bioactive glass (BGMS_LS), capable of responding to the main limitations of commercial BGs, is presented. The new material contains strontium and magnesium, whose therapeutic relevance is well known, and can be sintered at extraordinarily low temperatures without crystallizing, thus keeping all of its biological potential intact.",Materials,10.3390/ma15186263
A study on solidification of CaCO3 powder containing C-14 by using a low melting glass material,"© 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.CaCO3 powder containing C-14, which has a long half-life, is generated from the treatment process of spent activated carbons from the air cleaning system in a nuclear facility, can be decomposed into CaO and CO2 gas at a temperature above 600 °C. This CaCO3 must be fabricated into a stable waste form for final disposal at a temperature below 600 °C. In this study, tests on the solidification of CaCO3 into a waste form were conducted using a bismuth oxide glass with a low melting point. The CaCO3 was solidified into a homogeneous glass–ceramic waste form with a waste loading of 40 wt% at 460 °C without CaCO3 decomposition. This waste form had high values of density (3.15 g/cm3) and compressive strength (42.09 MPa), and it was confirmed through leaching tests (ANS 16.1, PCT) that the waste form also had a high chemical durability.",Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry,10.1007/s10967-022-08393-z
Biocompatible borate glasses doped with Gd2O3 for biomedical applications,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The studied materials contain two different types of intermediates (SrO and Gd2O3) which can enhance the biocompatible behavior of the material. Melt annealing was used to prepare new bioactive borate glasses with a composition of 42.7B2O3-(23.5−x) CaO-26Na2O-5SrO-2.8P2O5-xGd2O3 with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5 mol %. A heat-treated procedure was used to produce the glass–ceramic derivatives, which were characterized using various measurement techniques. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to test the prepared glass and its glass–ceramic derivatives before and after soaking in testing solutions (K2HPO4) and simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37 °C for different time intervals. After immersion in the K2HPO4 and SBF solutions, two FTIR absorbed bands were clearly formed at roughly 567 and 607 cm−1, suggesting the formation of the hydroxyapatite layer (HA). The major well-formed crystalline phases are calcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2) and calcium borate (CaB2O4) bioactive phases.

Novel SrO-Containing Glass-Ceramic Sealants for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOEC): Their Design and Characterization under Relevant Conditions,"© 2022 by the authors.This study presents results on the development of strontium oxide (SrO) containing glass sealants used to join Crofer22APU to yttria-stabilized zirconia (3YSZ), in which the main glass components, that is, silicon oxide (SiO2), strontium oxide (SrO), calcium oxide (CaO) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3), have been varied appropriately. Certain properties, such as the crystallization behavior, the coefficient of thermal expansion, adhesion, and reactivity of the sealants in contact with Crofer22APU, have been reviewed and discussed. The optimized glass composition (with CTE in the 9.8–10.3 × 10−6 K−1 range) results in a good joining behavior by hindering the formation of undesirable strontium chromate (SrCrO4) on contact with the Crofer22APU steel after 1000 h. at 850 °C. High specific resistivity values of about 106 Ohm.cm have been obtained, thus demonstrating good insulating properties at 850 °C under an applied voltage of 1.6 V. A negligible degradation in the electrical resistivity trend was measured during the test up to 1000 h, thus excluding the presence of detrimental reactions of the glass-ceramic sealant in contact with Crofer22APU under a dual atmosphere, as confirmed using SEM-EDS post-mortem analyses.",Materials,10.3390/ma15175805
Post-Cure Development of the Degree of Conversion and Mechanical Properties of Dual-Curing Resin Cements,"© 2022 by the authors.This study investigated the effect of different curing conditions on the degree of conversion and mechanical properties of contemporary dual-curing resin cements. The material specimens were either light-cured directly, light-cured through a 1-mm lithium disilicate glass-ceramic layer, or self-cured. The degree of conversion was measured in 0.1-mm films using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy 1 day, 7 days, and 28 days post-cure. Specimens used to study the flexural strength and modulus were prepared according to the ISO 4049 protocol, stored for 28 days post-cure, and subjected to accelerated aging by absolute ethanol immersion. The degree of conversion values ranged between 44.3–77.8%. Flexural strength varied between 11.4–111.1 MPa, while flexural modulus amounted to 0.7–5.5 GPa. The degree of conversion was significantly affected by material type, curing conditions, and post-cure time; however, variations in curing conditions were the least influential factor. A statistically significant effect of curing conditions on the degree of conversion was identified for only one of the five materials tested, whereas the flexural strength and modulus of all tested materials were significantly reduced in the experimental groups that were light-cured through a ceramic layer or self-cured. The effect size analysis showed that mechanical properties were most affected by the material type, while the differences in curing conditions were less influential. A comparison of the degree of conversion and mechanical properties indicated that different curing conditions may lead to significantly different flexural strength and modulus, which are not necessarily accompanied by identifiable variations in the degree of conversion.",Polymers,10.3390/polym14173649
Europium (II)-Doped CaF2 Nanocrystals in Sol-Gel Derived Glass-Ceramic: Luminescence and EPR Spectroscopy Investigations,"© 2022 by the authors.The remarkable properties of Eu2+-activated phosphors, related to the broad and intense luminescence of Eu2+ ions, showed a high potential for a wide range of optical-related applications. Oxy-fluoride glass-ceramic containing Europium (II)-doped CaF2 nanocrystals embedded in silica matrix were produced in two steps: glass-ceramization in air at 800° with Eu3+-doped CaF2 nanocrystals embedded followed by Eu3+ to Eu2+ reduction during annealing in reducing atmosphere. The broad, blue luminescence band at 425 nm and with the long, weak tail in the visible range is assigned to the d → f type transition of the Eu2+ located inside the CaF2 nanocrystals in substitutional and perturbed sites, respectively; the photoluminescence quantum yield was about 0.76. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Electron paramagnetic spectroscopy confirmed the presence of Eu2+ inside the CaF2 nanocrystals. Thermoluminescence curves recorded after X-ray irradiation of un-doped and Eu2+-doped glass-ceramics showed a single dominant glow peak at 85 °C related to the recombination between F centers and Eu2+ related hole within the CaF2 nanocrystals. The applicability of the procedure can be tested to obtain an oxy-fluoride glass-ceramic doped with other divalent ions such as Sm2+, Yb2+, as nanophosphors for radiation detector or photonics-related applications.",Nanomaterials,10.3390/nano12173016

Shade management using a new zirconia-reinforced lithium disilicate press ceramic system and leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic veneering system,"The adhesive bonding technique together with tooth-colored ceramic material in fabricating veneers is considered one of the greatest achievements in modern prosthodontics. There is a wide range of indications for veneers, but they are most commonly used to establish adequate function and mask tooth discolorations and inappropriate tooth shape, size or position. A large variety of all-ceramic materials with excellent properties is available on the market today. It is challenging to select the material that will provide the best esthetics and function. The present article explains the principles of a modern, individual treatment approach for a young adult patient with multiple diastemata and shade disharmonies in the maxillary anterior teeth. The treatment plan was based on the selection of the appropriate ceramic material and technical procedures to achieve the best esthetic results using veneers. This included analyzing the specific case; defining the treatment goal; determining the precise shade; and selecting the most suitable and appropriate ceramic material, preparation design, fabrication technique, and adhesive concept. It was decided to use the new VITA zirconia-reinforced lithium disilicate press ceramic system and leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic veneering system to fabricate indirect ceramic veneers for all the maxillary anterior teeth. The size, shape, position, and shade of the natural teeth were changed and the diastemata were closed to achieve a more proportional dental relationship. The esthetic and functional goals were achieved and the patient was extremely satisfied with the final outcome.",The international journal of esthetic dentistry,10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.05.023
"Flexural strengths, failure load, and hardness of glass-ceramics for dental applications","© 2022 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Glass-ceramics are often selected for use in dental restorations based upon advertised flexural strengths obtained from standardized tests on prefabricated specimens (bars and disks); these may not accurately reflect their performance in dental applications. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine and compare 4-point flexural strength, biaxial flexural strength, hardness, and crown failure loads for 3 commercially available glass-ceramics. Material and methods: Specimens were pressed and prepared from 3 brands of glass-ceramics: Celtra (CEL), IPS e.max (EMA), and Lisi (LIS). Rectangular bars, circular disks, and fully contoured crowns were created (n=15 specimens per glass-ceramic, 45 specimens per geometry, totaling 135 specimens). Disks were tested for biaxial flexural strength by using a piston-on-3-ball (POB) test, while bars were tested for 4-point flexural strength by using 4-point bending (4PB) and Vickers hardness (VH) tests. Crown failure loads were assessed in “crunch-the-crown” (CTC) tests. The results were analyzed by using general linear modeling, the Pearson correlation coefficient, and Weibull analysis. Results: The general linear modeling revealed significant differences (P<.05) in the failure load for crown specimens (EMA>LIS>CEL), the 4-point flexural strength (EMA>LIS>CEL), and the biaxial flexural strength (EMA>LIS=CEL). The disk specimens had higher flexural strengths than the bar specimens for CEL and EMA materials. LIS had a higher Weibull modulus than EMA and CEL for bar and crown specimens. CEL had a higher Weibull modulus than LIS and EMA for disk specimens. There was no correlation among the VH (R2=0.86 and P=.24), biaxial flexural strength (R2=0.84 and P=.26), and crown failure load. However, there was a high correlation between the failure load (crown specimens) and 4-point flexural strength (bar specimens) (R2=0.99 and P=.03). Conclusions: The 4-point flexural strength correlated significantly with crown failure load.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1007/s11431-022-2119-3
TXV Technology: The cornerstone of 3D system-in-packaging,"© 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.System-in-packaging (SiP) can realize the integration and miniaturization of electronic devices and it is significant to continue Moore’s law.

Glass ceramics containing mainly the Nb2Te4O13 crystalline phase were obtained by heat treatment of the glass at 540 °C for 1, 2, or 4 h. For the glass and glass ceramics, emission peaks originating from the 4f → 4f transitions of Eu3+ appeared under irradiation with 530 nm light or X-rays. Among the samples, the highest emission intensity in the photoluminescence and X-ray-induced scintillation spectra was obtained for the glass. Furthermore, typical photoluminescence and scintillation decay time constants originating from the 4f → 4f transitions of Eu3+ were obtained for the glass and glass ceramics. The afterglow level of the glass was comparable to that of the glass ceramics.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,10.1007/s10854-022-08892-5
Luminescence and energy transfer of Sm3+/Eu3+ co-doped transparent glass ceramics,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The Sm3+/Eu3+ doped transparent glass ceramics (GCs) containing Na7.15(Al7.2Si8.8O32) crystallite were successfully prepared by melt crystallization. Combined with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and light transmittance curve, so the best heat treat condition of GCs is 560 °C for 2 h. According to the emission spectrum, the appropriate doping concentration of Sm3+ and Eu3+ is determined to be 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively. The decrease of fluorescence lifetime of Sm3+ confirms the energy transfer (ET) from Sm3+ to Eu3+. The critical distance between Sm3+ and Eu3+ is 5.15 nm, and the mechanism of ET is electric multipole interaction. The chromaticity coordinates are calculated according to the emission spectrum, and luminescence color of GCs is in red region. So the Sm3+/Eu3+ co-doped containing Na7.15(Al7.2Si8.8O32) crystallite GCs is a promising red luminescent material.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2022.112531
UV-C irradiation-based inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in contaminated porous and non-porous surfaces,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic emphasized effective cleaning and disinfection of common spaces as an essential tool to mitigate viral transmission. To address this problem, decontamination technologies based on UV-C light are being used. Our aim was to generate coherent and translational datasets of effective UV-C-based SARS-CoV-2 inactivation protocols for the application on surfaces with different compositions. Virus infectivity after UV-C exposure of several porous (bed linen, various types of upholstery, synthetic leather, clothing) and non-porous (types of plastic, stainless steel, glass, ceramics, wood, vinyl) materials was assessed through plaque assay using a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate. Studies were conducted under controlled environmental conditions with a 254-nm UV-C lamp and irradiance values quantified using a 254 nm-calibrated sensor. From each material type (porous/non-porous), a product was selected as a reference to assess the decrease of infectious virus particles as a function of UV-C dose, before testing the remaining surfaces with selected critical doses. Our data show that UV-C irradiation is effectively inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on both material types. However, an efficient reduction in the number of infectious viral particles was achieved much faster and at lower doses on non-porous surfaces. The treatment effectiveness on porous surfaces was demonstrated to be highly variable and composition-dependent. Our findings will support the optimization of UV-C-based technologies, enabling the adoption of effective customizable protocols that will help to ensure higher antiviral efficiencies.",Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology,10.1016/j.biteb.2022.101176
"Biogenic silicate glass-ceramics: Physical, dielectric, and electrical properties","© 2022Biogenic silicate glass-ceramics were synthesized from the rice husk and eggshell powder (ESP) using the melt-quench method. The crystallite size (0.351–0.370 nm) increased and the bandgap (3.43–3.15 eV) decreased as the ESP concentration increased from 10 to 20 wt%. The higher dielectric constant at lower frequency range is attributed to the accumulation of charge carriers at the grain boundaries. Beyond ≥350 °C, the maximum dielectric loss was observed due to hopping of charge carriers between Ca2+ and Si4+. The impedance decreased from 8 × 106 to 2 × 102 with respect to the frequency (1 × 103 to 1 × 105 Hz). After the kink temperature (495 °C), the activation energy was observed to be increased from 0.73 to 0.74eV for ESP = 10 wt% and from 0.76 to 0.78 eV for ESP = 20 wt%. The study of silicate glass-ceramics suggests major applications in the field infrared heating elements and optoelectronics.",Bioresource Technology Reports,10.1016/j.dental.2022.07.009
"On the assignment of quartz-like LiAlSi2O6 - SiO2 solid solutions in dental lithium silicate glass-ceramics: Virgilite, high quartz, low quartz or stuffed quartz derivatives?","© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Objectives: Here we aim to provide a background on X-Ray Diffraction analysis of quartz-like crystal structures with varying amounts of Al3+ and Li+ substitution, existing confusions on their nomenclature and its implications for novel lithium silicate glass-ceramics. Methods: We reviewed the literature dealing with modifications of the quartz crystal structure and their stuffed LiAlSi2O6 derivates, LiAlSi2O6 – SiO2 solid solutions, the terminology of such phases and criteria used to define the structure known as virgilite. Based on this information, we attempted to allocate the quartz-like phases found in CEREC TesseraTM, InitialTM LiSi Block and Amber® Mill in the range of LiAlO2 - SiO2 solid solutions. For this purpose, their lattice parameters obtained from Rietveld refinement were compared with the lattice parameters of members of the corresponding solid solutions with defined SiO2 molar fraction found in the literature. Results: Based on the lattice parameters available for low quartz, high quartz and its stuffed derivatives, including LiAlSi2O6 and the mineral virgilite, a plot of the a- and c-parameters vs. the mol% SiO2 related to LiAlO2 was constructed with the literature data and the data found for the three dental lithium silicates. As per the definitions of virgilite as either LixAlxSi3-xO6, with 0.5 < x < 1 or especially as members of the LiAlSi2O6 – SiO2 solid-solution series with more than 50 mol% LiAlSi2O6, the crystal structures in CEREC TesseraTM, InitialTM LiSi Block and Amber® Mill failed to fall within the ranges of mol% SiO2 confined for virgilite. Significance: Based on available literature and definitions, the quartz-like phases found in the three dental lithium silicates should be addressed as stuffed (probably low) quartz solid solutions instead of “virgilite”. However determined by mineralogical practices, the term “virgilite” for parts of the LiAlSi2O6 – SiO2 solid solution is ambiguous and can be considered as arbitrary.",Dental Materials,10.1002/btm2.10386
"Cell loaded hydrogel containing Ag-doped bioactive glass–ceramic nanoparticles as skin substitute: Antibacterial properties, immune response, and scarless cutaneous wound regeneration","© 2022 The Authors. Bioengineering & Translational Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Institute of Chemical Engineers.An ideal tissue-engineered dermal substitute should possess angiogenesis potential to promote wound healing, antibacterial activity to relieve the bacterial burden on skin, as well as sufficient porosity for air and moisture exchange. In light of this, a glass–ceramic (GC) has been incorporated into chitosan and gelatin electrospun nanofibers (240–360 nm), which MEFs were loaded on it for healing acceleration. The GC was doped with silver to improve the antibacterial activity. The bioactive nanofibrous scaffolds demonstrated antibacterial and superior antibiofilm activities against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The nanofibrous scaffolds were biocompatible, hemocompatible, and promoted cell attachment and proliferation. Nanofibrous skin substitutes with or without Ag-doped GC nanoparticles did not induce an inflammatory response and attenuated LPS-induced interleukin-6 release by dendritic cells. The rate of biodegradation of the nanocomposite was similar to the rate of skin regeneration under in vivo conditions. Histopathological evaluation of full-thickness excisional wounds in BALB/c mice treated with mouse embryonic fibroblasts-loaded nanofibrous scaffolds showed enhanced angiogenesis, and collagen synthesis as well as regeneration of the sebaceous glands and hair follicles in vivo.",Bioengineering and Translational Medicine,10.1016/j.cma.2022.115340
A meshfree peridynamic model for brittle fracture in randomly heterogeneous materials,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work we aim to develop a unified mathematical framework and a reliable computational approach to model the brittle fracture in heterogeneous materials with variability in material microstructures, and to provide statistical metrics for quantities of interest, such as the fracture toughness. To describe the material responses such as the nucleation and growth of fractures in a uniform setting, we consider the peridynamics model. In particular, a stochastic state-based peridynamic model is developed, where the micromechanical parameters are modeled by a finite-dimensional random field, e.g., a combination of truncated random variables determined by the Karhunen–Loève decomposition or the principal component analysis (PCA). To solve this stochastic peridynamic problem, probabilistic collocation method (PCM) is employed to sample the random field that represents the micromechanical parameters. For each sample, the corresponding peridynamic problem is solved by an optimization-based meshfree quadrature rule. We present rigorous analysis for the proposed scheme and verify the convergence rate with a number of benchmark problems. The proposed scheme not only possesses the asymptotic compatibility spatially but also achieves an algebraic or sub-exponential convergence rate in the parametric random space when the number of collocation points grows. Finally, to validate the applicability of this approach on real-world fracture problems, we consider the problem of crystallization toughening in glass-ceramic materials, in which the material at the microstructural scale contains both amorphous glass and crystalline phases. The proposed stochastic peridynamic solver is employed to capture the crack initiation and its growth of the glass-ceramics with different crystal volume fractions, and the averaged fracture toughness are also calculated accordingly. The numerical estimates of fracture toughness show good consistency with data from experimental measurements.",Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering,10.1016/j.optmat.2022.112715
Effect of Mg2+/Sr2+ addition on luminescence properties of Dy3+ doped glass ceramics containing Ca2Ti2O6,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Dy2O3-doped transparent glass-ceramics containing Ca2Ti2O6 crystal phase were synthesized by melting crystallization method. The optimum heat treatment condition was determined to be 710 °C/1.5 h by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmittance curves. The optimal doped concentration of Dy2O3 is 0.4 mol%. The effects of doping with different concentrations of Mg2+ and Sr2+ on the fluorescence intensity of glass-ceramics were discussed. In comparison to Sr2+, the addition of Mg2+ effectively increased the luminescence intensity of 0.4 mol% Dy2O3-doped glass-ceramics. Since Mg2+ has a smaller ionic radius, it has a larger Coulomb potential and is more attractive to O2−, which makes the three-dimensional skeleton of BO6 tilt, and the symmetry of the structure deteriorates, resulting in enhanced luminescence. Comparison of 0.4 mol%Dy2O3-doped glass-ceramic and 8 mol%MgF2-0.4 mol%Dy2O3 co-doped glass-ceramic, the fluorescence intensity increased by 56.8% at 484 nm and 83.5% at 577 nm, the optical band gap value was reduced from 2.7824 eV to 2.4341 eV. The findings suggest that Dy3+-doped glass-ceramics containing Ca2Ti2O6 crystal phase will be used in white light-emitting diodes (W-LEDs).",Optical Materials,10.1007/s10163-022-01451-4
Recovery of platinum and synthesis of glass–ceramic from spent automotive catalyst via co-treatment process with coal fly ash,"© 2022, Crown.Spent automotive catalyst (SAC) has attracted attention because of containing platinum group metals (PGMs) along with hazardous materials such as heavy metals and organic substances. In this work, a new process was proposed to recover platinum in SAC and simultaneously prepare glass–ceramics by co-treatment process with coal fly ash (CFA). The experimental results indicated that platinum can be highly recovered and that glass–ceramics can also be successfully prepared. The maximum platinum recovery was approximately 99% when the optimum CFA addition, iron collector addition, and CaO/SiO2 mass ratio were 30–50 wt%, 5 wt%, and 0.7–0.8, respectively, at 1550 °C for 60 min. Under these optimal conditions, the enrichment coefficient of platinum was approximately 4.2, and the platinum content in the obtained glassy slag was below 4 g/t. Meanwhile, the results of the leaching efficiency of heavy metals in glassy slag showed that the obtained glassy slag is a harmless residue. Moreover, an economic evaluation was also carried out by comparing other metal collection processes. Furthermore, the synthesis of glass–ceramics by a one-step heat-treatment process further confirmed that this proposed approach was an economical and promising method for recycling platinum from SAC and reutilizing of CFA.",Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management,10.1016/j.optmat.2022.112648
"Optical properties of glasses and glass-ceramics for optical amplifiers, photovoltaic devices, color displays, optical limiters, and Random Lasers","© 2022A review of recent works with glasses and glass-ceramics having characteristics appropriate to be used in various types of optical devices is presented. Germanate and tellurite glasses, doped with rare-earth ions and heat-treated in proper ways were studied.

Radiation shielding performance of Co2O3–TeO2–Li2O–ZrO2 glass–ceramics,"© 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Australian Ceramic Society.This study presents the photon shielding factors, viz, the linear attenuation (LAC) and mass (MAC) attenuation coefficients, half-value layer (HVL), transmission factor TF, and effective atomic number Zeff of xCo2O3-(100 − x)[80 TeO2–19Li2O–1ZrO2] glass–ceramic system (for 0 ≤ x ≤ 20 mol%) synthesized by the melt-quench method. The parameters were estimated using FLUKA simulations and compared with WinXCOM calculations for low photon energies in the range 241–2510 keV. Generally, LAC values smoothly decline with photon energy with highest (lowest) value at minimum (maximum) energy. The corresponding highest (lowest) values of LAC was 0.961 (0.205), 0.955(0.206), 0.911 (0.205), and 0.853 (0.205) cm−1 for Co2O3 concentration of 0–20 mol%. The HVL values of CoTeLiZr1 and CoTeLiZr4 samples equaled 0.72 cm and 0.81 cm, correspondingly, at photon energy 284 keV and both increased to 3.38 cm at 2506 keV. At minimum (maximum) photon energy, Zeff value was obtained as 27.94 (19.27), 27.73 (19.16), 26.08 (18.35), and 24.06 (17.59) for CoTeLiZr1, CoTeLiZr2, CoTeLiZr3, and CoTeLiZr4, respectively. Analysis of all estimated parameters shows that the gamma photon shielding efficiency improves according to the trend CoTeLiZr1 > CoTeLiZr2 > CoTeLiZr3 > CoTeLiZr4. The partial replacement of TeO2 with CoO3 leads to the decline in the photon shielding efficacy and mass density of the glass–ceramics. The CoTeLiZr1–4 exhibit substantially enhanced shielding efficiency with respect to ordinary concrete, barite concrete, and RS-253-G18 commercial shield. The present materials thus have great potential as gamma photon absorbers in nuclear facilities where low energy photons are applied.",Journal of the Australian Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jnucmat.2022.153879
Phase evolution and valence state change in Gd-Ce co-doped zirconolite glass-ceramics,"© 2022Zirconolite based glass-ceramic is widely researched for the immobilization of actinide-rich high-level waste (HLW). The research of the co-doping effect has important guiding significance for the waste disposal processes. In this study, the co-doping effects of gadolinium and cerium in the zirconolite glass-ceramics were investigated systematically by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results revealed that the high amount of Gd can be well incorporated in the Ce-bearing zirconolite particles. The zirconolite was transformed from 2M to 3T structure with the increase of the Gd-doping concentration. The further addition of Gd caused the formation of Gd2Ti2O7 pyrochlore with the doping concentration of about 10.0 wt%, while the zirconolite was still the dominant ceramic phase. The reduction of Ce from Ce4+ to Ce3+ was firstly inhibited and then stabilized with the doping of Gd in this system, indicated that the redox equilibrium of cerium (Ce4+ ↔ Ce3+) was established in the sample with the high amount of Gd doping. This work aimed to further understand the co-doping effect of actinides in zirconolite glass-ceramics, which is expected to provide an important basic scientific basis for underground disposal of HLW.",Journal of Nuclear Materials,10.1016/j.nocx.2022.100102
Atomistic to continuum simulations of fracture and damage evolutions in oxide glass and glass-ceramic materials: A critical review,"© 2022 The Author(s)Fracture and damage ascribed to the intrinsic brittleness of amorphous oxide glasses are crucial problems for the daily use of glass products.

The influence of inorganic fillers on the light transmission through resin-matrix composites during the light-curing procedure: an integrative review,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Purpose: The objective of this study was to perform an integrative review on the effect the inorganic fillers on the light transmission through the resin-matrix composites during the light-curing procedure. Method: A bibliographic review was performed on PubMed using the following search terms: “fillers” OR “particle” AND “light curing” OR “polymerization” AND “light transmission” OR “light absorption” OR “light irradiance” OR “light attenuation” OR “light diffusion” AND “resin composite.” The search involved articles published in English language in the last 10 years. Results: Selected studies reported a decrease in biaxial strength and hardness in traditional resin-matrix composites in function of the depth of polymerization. However, there were no significant differences in biaxial strength and hardness recorded along the polymerization depth of Bulk-Fill™ composites. Strength and hardness were enhanced by increasing the size and content of inorganic fillers although some studies revealed a progressive decrease in the degree of conversion on increasing silica particle size. The translucency of glass–ceramic spherical fillers promoted light diffusion mainly in critical situations such as in the case of deep proximal regions of resin-matrix composites. Conclusions: The amount of light transmitted through the resin-matrix composites is influenced by the size, content, microstructure, and shape of the inorganic filler particles. The decrease of the degree of conversion affects negatively the physical and mechanical properties of the resin-matrix composites. Clinical relevance: The type and content of inorganic fillers in the chemical composition of resin-matrix composites do affect their polymerization. As a consequence, the clinical performance of resin-matrix composites can be compromised leading to variable physical properties and degradation. The polymerization mode of resin-matrix composites can be improved according to the type of inorganic fillers in their chemical composition.",Clinical Oral Investigations,10.1002/adem.202200350

"Investigations of the thermal, structural, and Near-IR emission properties of Ag containing fluorophosphate glasses and their crystallization process","© 2022In this work, the impact of Ag2O on the thermal, structural, and Near-IR luminescence of Er3+ doped calcium-fluorophosphate glasses is investigated. The amount of silver oxide in the glass significantly impacts its thermal stability and crystallization process. The increase in the thermal stability of the glasses might be attributed to the depolymerization of the metaphosphate network evidenced using FTIR and Raman spectroscopies. The precipitation of Ag nanoparticles within the glass network, induced by a thermal treatment, has been confirmed by the appearance of a clear visible broad absorption band centered at about 450 nm in the glasses after heat treatment. Such species induce a significant enhancement in the Er3+ IR emission. Transparent glass-ceramics have also been processed by thermally treating the glasses. The XRD analyses have revealed that the addition of Ag2O in the glass promotes the precipitation of new crystalline phases at the expense of CaF2 crystals. The presence of such nanostructures in the glass network induces some modifications in the distribution of Er ion sites.",Optical Materials,10.1016/j.nocx.2022.100105

Hierarchically porous glass–ceramics by alkaline activation and crystallization from municipal solid waste incineration ashes,"© 2022As a hazardous waste, municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash poses a serious threat to the environment, and considerable efforts have been made to achieve its harmless treatment. Herein, a novel approach for handling MSWI fly ash has been proposed to prepare porous glass–ceramics by alkali activation–crystallization, which overcomes the difficulty of controlling air bubbles under high temperatures. MSWI bottom ash rich in Al2O3 and SiO2 are co-treating as raw material to develop glass framework structure. The alkali activation mechanism shows that the development of MSWI ashes based basic glass from monomer to silica–aluminate gel under alkaline condition.

Crystallization Characteristics and Properties of Glass Ceramics Derived from Iron Tailing,"© 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.In this study, iron tailings were used as raw materials mixing with Al2O3, SiO2, and/or CaO sintered at 950–1400 °C to produce glass ceramics. In Al2O3/tailing and Al2O3/SiO2/tailing systems, the newly formed crystalline mullite (3Al2O3·2SiO2) reached its maximum content of 83.7 wt% for sample with Al2O3/SiO2/tailing mass ratio of 6/2/2. In Al2O3/SiO2/CaO/tailing system, the content of newly formed anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) increased to the maximum of 72.9 wt% for sample with Al2O3/SiO2/CaO/tailing mass ratio of 7/8/4/6 sintered at 1450 °C. The properties of glass ceramic products were significantly improved in samples with high content of crystalline mullite or anorthite and low surface porosity. Obtained glass ceramic in Al2O3/SiO2/tailing system with mass ratio of 6/2/6 showed excellent properties of chemical resistance (99.99%), compressive strength (1061.6 MPa), and low water absorption (0.2%).

"Microstructure, residual stresses, and mechanical performance of surface crystallized translucent glass-ceramics","© 2022 Elsevier LtdMechanical properties of glasses can be significantly increased by inducing surface crystallization of a low coefficient of thermal expansion phase. In this work, we produced surface crystallized lithia-alumina-silica glass-ceramics with different crystallized layer thicknesses and analysed the resulting residual stresses and their effect on mechanical properties. The residual stress magnitude was estimated by analytical and experimental methods, as well as numerical modeling. The surface compressive stress reached 390 MPa and 490 MPa, as given by the analytical and experimental determination, respectively. These stresses prevented radial cracking in microhardness and scratch tests. The best glass-ceramic achieved a Vickers hardness of 7.5 GPa and fracture strength of 680 ± 50 MPa in a ball-on-three-ball test. These glass-ceramics are translucent, providing 50–60% transmittance over the visible wavelength spectrum (1.3 mm-thick-sample).

Heavily Er2O3 doped TeO2 based glass-ceramics with large grain size and high transparency for broadband ∼1.55 and efficient ∼3.5 μm fluorescence,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, heavily Er2O3 doped TeO2 glass was employed for the fabrication of transparent glass ceramics with broadband NIR and efficient MIR emissions. The simple composition of the glass was to minimize the refractive index difference between the glass and precipitated crystal to obtain high transmittance glass ceramics with large grain size. The heavily doping concentration was favor to obtain broadband NIR and efficient MIR emissions. The influence of the temperature and duration of the heat treatment on the size of the precipitated Er2Te5O13 crystal was investigated.

Effect of biphasic-phase on the mid-infrared emission properties of Pr3+ doped GeSe2-Ga2Se3 chalcogenide glass ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Mid-infrared (MIR) laser operating at 2–5 μm has gained increasing interest because of the extensive applications in fields from biomedicine, sensing to nanomaterial science. Chalcogenide glass (ChG) is a kind of matrix that is promising for MIR laser due to its low phonon energy and wide infrared transmittance region. However, significant challenges in the enhancement of MIR optical properties of rare-earth ion-doped ChGs still exist. Here, enhanced MIR emission was realized in Pr3+-doped chalcogenide glass ceramics (ChGCs). By controlling the heat treatment temperature and duration, biphasic-phase nanocrystals of Ga2Se3 and GeSe2 were successively precipitated in the glass host. Compared to the as-prepared glass, the GCs exhibit an obvious increase in emission intensity by more than 5 times. The improvement of the MIR emission may be induced by the enhanced cross-relaxation between Pr3+ ions and the increased multiple scattering effects. Furthermore, the obtained ChGC enables large stimulated emission cross section 0.42 × 10−20 cm2 at 2.44 μm and 0.62 × 10−20 cm2 at 4.75 μm. The superior optical properties of the ChGC indicate that it is an attractive candidate for MIR laser.",Journal of Luminescence,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121714
Examining the role of nucleating agents within glass-ceramic systems,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Nucleation is one of the primary contributions to the microstructure of glass-ceramics. However, the nucleation process within glass-ceramics is not understood across all glass systems, nor is the specific role of nucleating agents. The present article proposes a comprehensive definition of a nucleating agent: “a nucleating agent is a minority component of the glass composition that leads to increased internal nucleation rates or precipitation and control of desired crystal phases, either by lowering the thermodynamic or the kinetic barrier for nucleation, or some combination thereof”. We also examine the role that five important nucleating agents (TiO2, ZrO2, MoO3, P2O5, and OH−) play in different systems, particularly in their effect on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the nucleation process. We argue that nucleating agents help control the nucleation process either by decreasing the thermodynamic or kinetic barrier or some combination of the two and provide a method to distinguish their effect.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.090
Some features of the surface modification of MgO–Al2O3–TiO2–SiO2 glass and glass ceramics by Ag diffusion,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Diffusion of Ag species into the surface layers of the MgO–Al2O3–TiO2–SiO2 glass stimulates the crystallization processes therein during subsequent thermal treatment. It was found that the silver doping significantly increases the microhardness of glass and glass ceramics. The effect of the Ag diffusion and the subsequent high-temperature treatment (T > Tg) on the structure and luminescence properties of the MgO–Al2O3–TiO2–SiO2 glass was studied. The thermal evolution, structure and properties of the glass and glass ceramics were investigated by the DSC method, XRD analysis and luminescence spectroscopy. It was found that the Ag diffusion into the surface layers leads to the formation of numerous different luminescent molecular Agn clusters. The MgO–Al2O3–TiO2–SiO2 glass and glass ceramics subjected to the Ag diffusion can operate as effective down-converters of the radiation demonstrating the effective transformation of UV and blue light into the radiation of red and NIR spectral range.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.compstruct.2022.115786
Machine learning based thermal imaging damage detection in glass-epoxy composite materials,"© 2022 The Author(s)Machine learning (ML) based fatigue damage detection from thermal imaging in glass-epoxy composites is an important component of remote structural health monitoring used for safety assessment and optimization of composite structures and components. However, accurate characterization of fatigue damage hotspots in terms of size, shape, location, hysteretic heat, and local temperature deep inside the material using surface thermal images remains a challenge to date. This work aims at evaluating the theoretical accuracy level of hotspot characterization by training a ML model with artificially generated thermal images from 3D finite element models with increasing complexity. Modelling the fatigue damage as an intrinsic heat source allowed to significantly reduce the influence of thermal image noise and other uncertainties related to heat transfer. It is shown that ML can indeed accurately recover the heat influx, depth, and geometry of the heat source from the original thermal images of the composite materials with prediction accuracies in the range 85%–99%. The effect of training set size and image resolution on the prediction error is also presented. The findings reported in this work contribute to the advancement of accurate and efficient remote fatigue damage detection methods for fibre composite materials.",Composite Structures,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.210
Torsional behaviour of a glass-ceramic joined alumina coated Crofer 22 APU steel,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The robustness of the sealings used for the solid oxide cell (SOC) stack technology is crucial to prevent gases from mixing and failure. With a desire to increase the internal operating pressure the mechanical performance requirement of sealings increases. The mechanical behaviour of a glass-ceramic joined steel (Crofer 22 APU) and glass-ceramic interfaces used in SOC stacks has here been studied. The shear strength was measured at room temperature using a torsion test of as joined and aged (700 h in air at 750 °C) hourglass shaped samples. The Crofer 22 APU steel samples were coated with alumina before joining and the joining process was designed on the basis of shrinkage measurements taken from hot stage microscopy. The glass-ceramic joining material was applied as a tape casted foil between two alumina coated half hourglass steel samples, and then joined at 800 °C in air. Cross-sections and fracture surfaces were investigated, by means of SEM-EDS, to understand the effect of ageing on the joined samples. XRD was carried out on the as joined and on the aged glass-ceramic materials to investigate the ageing effect on the amorphous and crystalline phases. The shear strength of the as joined and aged samples was measured on six samples per group, and values of 40 ± 6 MPa and 34 ± 6 MPa were obtained, respectively.",Ceramics International,10.1002/pssb.202200016
"93Nb NMR Study of (K, Na)NbO3-Doped SiO2–Na2O–Al2O3 Glasses","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Aluminosilicate glasses containing octahedral NbO6 units are developed for future applications as optical materials. Soda-aluminosilicate glasses doped with Nb-based alkaline perovskite crystals (K0.5Na0.5NbO3 [KNN]) at different doping levels (2–30 mol%) are studied by 93Nb nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The Al2O3 concentration in the starting soda-aluminosilicate glass matrix is varied from 5 to 17 mol% to investigate the influence of the composition of local Nb structures with 4–5, 6, and 7–8 fold-oxygen coordination on the optical properties of the glasses. The chemical shifts are analyzed by comparison with the 93Nb NMR data of reference crystals, including KNN, to determine the feasibility of producing more NbO6 octahedra in the aluminosilicate glasses, where these octahedra are expected to promote the development of optically active Nb-glass-ceramics. The data show that both glass polymerization and KNN content influence the Nb local environment. Therefore, an appropriate amount of Al2O3 combined with an adequate doping level of the KNN perovskite is required to achieve the desired optical features. Contrary to expectations, a higher KNN doping level is achieved with the starting depolymerized soda-aluminosilicate glass containing 5 mol% Al2O3, leading to perovskite-like structures of NbO6 octahedra in the resultant glass system.",Physica Status Solidi (B) Basic Research,10.1111/jace.18540
Dual effect of ZrO2 on phase separation and crystallization in Li2O–Al2O3–SiO2–P2O5 glasses,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.ZrO2 is an effective nucleation agent for low-expansion lithium–aluminum silicate (LAS) glass–ceramic (GC) with high Al2O3 content. However, the effect of ZrO2 is still not fully understood in LAS glasses with low contents of Al2O3 and P2O5. In this work, the effect of ZrO2 on the phase separation and crystallization of Li2O–Al2O3–SiO2–P2O5 glasses were investigated. The results revealed that ZrO2 significantly increased Tg and the crystallization temperature of Li2SiO3 and Li2Si2O5 crystals. Li3PO4 crystals precipitated preferentially in the glass containing 3.6-mol% ZrO2, wherein Zr was stable in the network and no precipitation of ZrO2 nanocrystals was observed. Moreover, the separation of phosphate-rich phases in the as-quenched glasses increased with the addition of ZrO2. The findings of the study revealed a dual role of ZrO2. First, ZrO2 acted as a glass network former rather than a nucleation agent, increasing glass viscosity and the nucleation barrier of Li2SiO3 through its strong network connectivity. Second, as Zr preferentially combined with non-bridging oxygen to form Si–O–Zr linkages, a sufficient amount of charge-balancing Li+ ions existed in the network, which promoted the separation of phosphate-rich phases. It indicated that the incorporation of ZrO2 contributes to the activation of the nucleation role of P2O5, thus contributing to the formation of nanocrystals and fine microstructure of GCs.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.102
Influence of shear stress state on dynamic fracture of a glass ceramic Macor,"© 2022 The AuthorThe effect of shear stress on the dynamic failure of ceramic materials is not sufficiently investigated in the published literature. With the use of a bespoke split Hopkinson pressure bar, this paper presents an effort to investigate the dynamic shear compressive response of Macor, a model ceramic material with zero porosity and light weight characteristics. A cone specimen and cylindrical specimens with varying inclined angles are used to introduce the shear stress to the Macor ceramic. The dynamic failure initiation and crack propagation are monitored by the high speed photography and Digital Image Correlation techniques. It is found that the equivalent stress of Macor at the initiation of failure decreases nonlinearly with the increase of shear stress. The high speed images show that the crack originates from the minimum cross-section of the cone specimen and the obtuse angle corner of the inclined cylindrical specimens. The cracks propagate parallel to the inclined plane instead of the axial loading direction. The fractographic analysis shows the compacted zone in the shear fracture surfaces of the cone specimen and the inclined cylindrical specimens. This indicates a significant role of shear loading in the dynamic failure process of Macor.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.125
Glass-ceramic route to NASICON-type NaxTi2(PO4)3 electrodes for Na-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Glass-ceramic processes to prepare NASICON-type NaxTi2(PO4)3, which is an anode candidate for sodium-ion batteries, from 30Na2O–40TiO2–30P2O5 glass have been investigated with varied atmospheric conditions. By annealing in the inert (N2) atmosphere, the glass started crystalizing into NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 with rhombohedral symmetry at ∼600 °C followed by crystallization of other phases to be multiphase mixtures at higher temperatures. In contrast, in the reducing (5% H2/Ar) atmosphere, NASICON-type Na3Ti2(PO4)3 with triclinic symmetry is crystallized at >∼800 °C. The formation of Na3Ti2(PO4)3 is associated with a loss of excess oxygens in the initial glass composition and a reduction of Ti from Ti4+ to Ti3+. The reduction process upon the glass-to-ceramic conversion was traced by in-situ observation during the thermogravimetric analysis. It is also revealed that the electrochemical Na + -storage capabilities of the glass-ceramic electrodes are correlated with the Na-ion occupancy between these two phases, and their phase fractions affect the charge-discharge properties of Na-ion cells. Finer glass-ceramic powders could improve the electrochemical properties and achieve almost 80% of its theoretical capacity.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.04.052
High temperature creep behaviour of glass-ceramic joined Nextel 610™/Al2O3-ZrO2 composites,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdOx/ox CMC based on Nextel 610™ fibers with 75 wt% alumina – 25 wt% zirconia matrix have been joined by a glass-ceramic and tested in creep in four-point bending (DIN EN 820–4) up to 50 h at 850 °C and 1000 °C, between 32 and 41 MPa. As a comparison, the creep limit of the non-joined ox/ox CMC was investigated in this range and also at higher temperatures and stresses. The creep experiments at 850 °C did not show any significant difference between joined and ox/ox CMC after 50 h, while a certain one was detected at 1000 °C on joined ox/ox CMC, suggesting that its creep mechanism is dominated by visco-elastic flow of the glass-ceramic.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.05.018
Dynamic response of a Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 transparent glass-ceramic under shock compression,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLi2O-Al2O3-SiO2 transparent glass-ceramics (LAS-TGCs) are promising candidates for transparent armour materials due to their excellent physical and mechanical capabilities. In this work, the dynamic behaviour of a LAS-TGC were further investigated using the planar impact technique and photon Doppler velocimetry. The shock stress, shock wave velocity, failure wave velocity and spall strength were obtained. In addition, the recompression signal, as a signature of failure waves, was observed to evolve into an oscillation signal as the impact stress decreases, indicating that the failure wave is gradually formed at a threshold. It has been noted that the failure wave velocity decreases with the increase in external loading and then turns upwards. The damage parameter of the LAS-TGC was assessed to be 0.410(5) under a shock stress of ~5.5 GPa, which is smaller than that of K9 glass. It is suggested that the LAS-TGC has better shock resistance than K9 glass.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.05.002
"Sintering behavior, structure and dielectric properties of CuO-ZnO-MgO-B2O3 glass-ceramics for ULTCC applications","© 2022 Elsevier LtdHigh performance ultra-low temperature co-fired ceramic (ULTCC) materials were prepared from CuO- MgO- ZnO- Al2O3- B2O3- Li2O glass-ceramics. The sintering behaviors, crystalline phase evolution, microstructure and dielectric properties, as well as their compatibility with Ag and Al electrodes, were investigated. With the suitable substitution of MgO for ZnO, the dielectric properties of glass-ceramics were improved. It is mainly associated with the fine microstructure, highly crystallinity, and decrease in tetrahedral distortion in the crystal lattice. All the glasses completed the densification at 575–600 °C, and ZnB4O7 is the only crystalline phase precipitated from the glasses. Moreover, the glass-ceramic with 1 wt% MgO sintered at 575 °C for 5 h, exhibited low relative permittivity ~ 7.1 and low dielectric loss ~ 6.40 × 10−4. And the glass-ceramic with 4 wt% MgO sintered at 600 °C for 5 h, also displayed low relative permittivity ~ 7.1 and low dielectric loss ~ 5.77 × 10−4. Both two glasses have good sintering compatibility with silver and aluminum electrodes, which provided high potential for ULTCC application.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2022.103157
"1,3,5-triacryloylhexahydro-1,3,5-triazine improves antibacterial and physicochemical properties of an experimental resin-based cement","© 2022 Elsevier LtdStable antibacterial cement could contribute to reducing the biofilm formation for a healthy marginal sealing in high-risk areas in indirect restorations. This study aimed to incorporate 1,3,5-triacryloylhexahydro-1,3,5-triazine (TAT) on experimental resin-based cements and evaluate its antibacterial and physicochemical properties. An experimental resin-based cement was formulated with 50 wt% Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate (BisGMA), 30 wt% Urethane Dimethacrylate (UDMA), 20 wt% Triethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), and initiators. Barium silicate glass was used as a filler (45 wt%) and two different groups were tested: CTAT with 15 wt% TAT addition and CCONTROL with no TAT addition. The developed cements were evaluated by their degree of conversion, film thickness, flow, flexural strength, softening solvent, cytotoxicity, and antibacterial activity. Microshear bond strength (μSBS) was evaluated regarding dental tissues, glass-ceramics, and polycrystalline ceramics. CTAT showed a higher degree of conversion, lower cytotoxicity, lower softening solvent, and an increased film thickness when compared to CCONTROL. No statistical difference was found between the groups for flow, flexural strength, planktonic antibacterial analysis, and cytotoxicity. Reduced biofilm formation was observed in the CTAT group. CTAT improved the μSBS values for a polycrystalline ceramic substrate. The addition of 1,3,5-triacryloylhexahydro-1,3,5-triazine showed anti-biofilm activity, increased degree of conversion, decreased cytotoxicity, and increased bond strength for IPS-YTZP substrate tested.",International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives,10.1177/14644207221086496
4D structures for the short-time building of emergency shelters,"© IMechE 2022.The increasing number of internal displaced people due to conflicts or natural disasters over the years represents the need to create structural solutions for first emergency shelter, which are currently supplied in tarpaulin and structures improvised by the locals. Innovative technologies like 4D printing could present an alternative, being possible to develop 3D structures with smart materials that react with environmental stimulus, such as water, light, heat and others. Unlike 3D printing, which is static, the factor ‘time’ adds a dimension to the 4D, making the structures self-assembling, multifunctional or self-repairing. Given this, the aim of this paper is to present research for the application of 4D-printed structures, for crises, to speed up and ease the assembly process, replacing the structures currently used with one that integrates the emergency kit. It also presents a review on emergency shelters, as well as on 3D and 4D printing processes, clarifying its definition and introducing a case study demonstrative of the process, by printing with shape memory filaments, specifically poly lactic acid and shape memory polymers. A concept was developed and validated, evaluating the possibility of applying 4D printing process in the development of structures that are easy to transport and assemble in emergencies, using the beneficial characteristics of shape memory polymer material. Therefore, the simulation of the concept and the improvement of material properties in terms of specific strength and toughness, which can be achieved using composite materials, are indicated as future recommendations. Moreover, the concept must be evaluated from a structural point of view.","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications",10.1016/j.materresbull.2022.111872
Impedance matching strategy boost excellent wave absorption performance of zinc-Aluminosilicate cladded short carbon fiber core-sheath structure,"© 2022Excellent impedance matching and practical material design are the keys to obtaining excellent microwave absorption performance and application. In this paper, a zinc aluminosilicate (ZAS) glass-ceramic precursor was prepared by a sol-gel method, short carbon fiber (SCF) was used as the main wave absorber, and a silane coupling agent (KH-550) was used to combine the ZAS and SCF. The oxidation concentration of short carbon fibers affects the load of KH-550, which changes the concentration of oxygen-containing groups on the SCF, affecting the thickness of the ZAS coated on the SCF to adjust the impedance matching of the material. In short, through simple experimental methods and adjustment methods, we can obtain the target's absorption performance and corresponding bandwidth. Our work provides a new idea for obtaining impedance matching adjustment of high-performance carbon fiber, and glass-ceramic composite electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbing materials.",Materials Research Bulletin,10.1007/s11998-022-00617-x
Evaluating the effectiveness of self-cleaning products applied on external thermal insulation composite systems (ETICS),"© 2022, American Coatings Association.External thermal insulation composite systems (ETICS) have been extensively applied on building façades with the aim of implementing the thermal and aesthetical properties of the building envelope. However, the formation of stains and deposition of particulate matter is often observed in the surface of these systems. The use of multifunctional products with self-cleaning properties can reduce surface anomalies and thus enhance the durability of ETICS. This study aims at evaluating the effectiveness of three protective coatings with self-cleaning additives (i.e., TiO2 nanoparticles), when applied on the surface of ETICS. Three different stains (rhodamine, methylene blue and silver paint aerosol) were applied on the ETICS finishing coat, evaluating the removal of these stains after exposure to natural (solar radiation) light source. The surface properties (compactness, hardness, roughness, gloss, and color) of the ETICS were evaluated prior and after sun exposure. Results showed that the application of the three products lead to a modification of the surface properties (compactness, hardness, gloss, roughness) of the ETICS specimens, and sensibly enhance the self-cleaning, hydrophobic and aesthetical properties of the ETICS.",Journal of Coatings Technology and Research,10.1016/j.net.2022.04.005
A novel approach for rice straw agricultural waste utilization: Synthesis of solid aluminosilicate matrices for cesium immobilization,"© 2022 Korean Nuclear SocietyA new approach to the use of rice straw as a difficult-to-recycle agricultural waste was proposed. Potassium aluminosilicate was obtained by spark plasma sintering as an effective material for subsequent immobilization of 137Cs into a solid-state matrix. The sorption properties of potassium aluminosilicate to 137Cs from aqueous solutions were studied. The effect of the synthesis temperature on the phase composition, microstructure, and rate of cesium leaching from samples obtained at 800–1000 °C and a pressure of 25 MPa was investigated. It was shown that the positive dynamics of compaction was characteristic of glass ceramics throughout the sintering. Glass ceramics RS-(K,Cs)AlSi3O8 obtained by the SPS method at 1000 °C for 5 min was characterized by a high density of ∼2.62 g/cm3, Vickers hardness ∼ 2.1 GPa, compressive strength ∼231.3 MPa and the rate of cesium ions leaching of ∼1.37 × 10−7 g cm−2·day−1. The proposed approach makes it possible to safe dispose of rice straw and reduce emissions into the atmosphere of microdisperse amorphous silica, which is formed during its combustion and causes respiratory diseases, including cancer. In addition, the obtained is perspective to solve the problem of recycling long-lived 137Cs radionuclides formed during the operation of nuclear power plants into solid-state matrices.",Nuclear Engineering and Technology,10.1007/s43207-022-00201-4
A new design of SiO2–Na2O–Al2O3 glass–ceramic and determination of elastic modulus and density of states via molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional tight-binding calculations,"© 2022, The Korean Ceramic Society.In this study, the SiO2–Na2O–Al2O3 system was designed by a quantum mechanical method based on density functional theory (DFT). The Na2O and Al2O3 were located on specific sites of silika (SiO2) structure. The geometrical optimization was applied to the system through self-consistent charge density functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB) to obtain the most stable structure. SCC-DFTB based molecular dynamics (MD) method was performed to create a SiO2–Na2O–Al2O3 glassy structure. In this context, the temperature of the model system was dropped from 2000 to 300 K with a high cooling rate and the model system was waited at 300 K for relaxation of the glassy structure. For understanding the glass–ceramic formation, the structural characterization was analysed by partial radial distribution function (RDF). The elastic modulus and total density of states (DOS) were calculated for realizing the mechanical and electronic properties of system. As a result, these results can provide a reference for modeling SiO2–Na2O–Al2O3 glass–ceramic.",Journal of the Korean Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jmst.2022.03.001
A general strategy towards improving the strength and thermal shock resistance of glass-ceramics through microstructure regulation,"© 2022Glass-ceramics are usually obtained through controlled crystallization. In this work, we propose a new strategy to add an appropriate amount of oxide particles to the parent glass to improve the performance of glass-ceramics. Different amounts of Al2O3 or/and CeO2 particles were added into a SiO2-Al2O3-ZnO-CaO-ZrO2-TiO2 based glass, and crystallization behavior, fracture strength, and thermal shock behavior were systematically evaluated. The results indicate that with the addition of Al2O3 or/and CeO2 particles of moderate amount, the unfavorable needle-like ZrSiO4, Zn2SiO4, and CaTiSiO5 crystals were largely inhibited when annealed at 900 °C. Accordingly, fracture strength is maintained high after heating at high temperatures. The thermal shock resistance is also enhanced drastically. The additive Al2O3 is thermodynamically favorable to react with the glass, forming particulate ZnAl2O4 instead of precipitating the needle-like crystals of Zn2SiO4 and CaTiSiO5; while CeO2 will combine with ZrO2 to form a solid solution and promote the precipitation of primary crystal CaZrTi2O7 that will not transform to ZrSiO4 with prolonging thermal exposure.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology,10.1111/jerd.12897
Influence of manufacturing technique on the color of zirconia restorations: Monolithic versus layered crowns,"© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Objectives: The study aimed to compare the color of monolithic and layered zirconia crowns fabricated using different brands in the cervical, middle, and incisal areas. Materials and Methods: A total of 45 crowns were fabricated from three brands (Katana, Nacera, Cercon) using three methods (monolithic = ML (n=5), cut-back + enamel = BL (n=5), cut-back + dentin + enamel = TL (n=5)). CIE L*, a* b*, C*, h° color coordinates were recorded with a dental spectrophotometer in cervical, middle, and incisal areas. Color differences between manufacturing techniques, tooth areas, and brands were calculated using the CIEDE2000(1:1:1) formula, and the values were compared to the perceptibility (PT00) and acceptability thresholds (AT00). Comparisons between color coordinates were analyzed statistically (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests, p < 0.001). Results: Significant differences were found between CIE L*, a*, b*, C*, h° coordinates of the zirconia crowns (p < 0.001), generally. The lowest color differences were obtained between BL and TL crowns in cervical and middle areas. Color differences between cervical and middle areas were mostly below PT00. An acceptable color difference was found between Katana and Cercon crowns. Conclusions: The manufacturing technique and the brand influenced the color of zirconia crowns. Also, the color of the crowns varied from cervical to incisal. Clinical Significance: Reproducing the optical properties of teeth with ceramic crowns might be challenging, given the differences in the internal configuration of the enamel and dentine, as well as their complex behavior when interacting with light. When deciding whether to fabricate a monolithic crown in translucent zirconia or improve its appearance by layering with more translucent glass–ceramic, the clinicians and dental technicians must be aware of these procedures' effect on the final color of the restorations.",Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry,10.1007/s12633-021-01553-y
Structural Characterization of Strontium Silicate Glasses and Glass Ceramics Applied as Glass Ionomer Cements (GICs),"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.Oxide glasses and glass ceramics in the xSrO-(45-x) SiO2-24.5CaO-24.5Na2O-6 P2O5, (x changes from 0 to 15 mol %) have been prepared and studied by several spectroscopic techniques. The structure of all as obtained compositions was confirmed to be amorphous in nature. The as prepared glasses were treated thermally at a specific temperature to activate the nucleation processes, which is suitable for the material to be used as scaffolds and implants. The glass ionomer cements (GICs) are prepared from two parts: powder of the crystallized glasses mixed with an aqueous poly (acrylic) acid solution. The state of GIC was checked up by both FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. The cement of strontium and calcium carboxyl groups are confirmed to be formed. The results based on NMR study suggested that the glass containing a significant amount of non-bridging oxygens NBOs can dissolve quickly in specific solutions and vice versa. GIC of chemical shift in the region of shielded silicate units (contains three bridging bonds) are confirmed to be formed. The shielded silicate units in the well-formed GIC prevent the material from corrosion and dissolutions in water that was checked up by durability measurement (Dr). Consequently, the as-obtained GIC is recommended to be applied as restorative and /or implants and scaffolds.",Silicon,10.1007/s12008-021-00803-y
Horn failure prediction in presence of internal defect in ultrasonic machining process through numerical investigation,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.Ultrasonic machining is an advanced machining process which is applied for the machining of tough and fragile materials viz. glass, ceramics, etc. The ultrasonic horn is a most essential component used to transfer the longitudinal mode of vibration to the ultrasonic tool through a transducer. This investigation has considered the design of two different profiles of ultrasonic horns (cylindrical & stepped) using tungsten carbide material in dynamic conditions. Modal analysis is performed to calculate the mode shapes and natural frequencies of both the horn profiles. The dimension of the horns under the frequency of 20 kHz is considered. The analysis is performed using ANSYS 18.1 workbench interface. Harmonic response analysis is executed to compute the stress and deformation behaviour of both the horn profiles. After the stresses are generated, a defect is introduced at the maximum stress point in both the horn design. The defects are generated in three different orientations, viz. along the longitudinal axis, perpendicular axis, and another one is inclined with respect to the oscillation of the horn. The maximum stress is generated in the stepped horn that is 370.55 MPa, where the defect is located at perpendicular to the longitudinal axis with respect to the oscillation of the horn. The current analysis can be considered as the tool to understand the behaviour of the horn in the presence of a defect in ultrasonic machining.",International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,10.1922/EJPRD_2348Bashary07
Evaluating the Bond Strength of a Polymer Infiltrated Ceramic Network to Zirconia Using the Crossbeam Push-Off Method,"Copyright© 2022 Dennis Barber Ltd.Porcelains and glass-ceramics have been used to produce CAD-milled veneers and crowns for zirconia copings and implant-abutments. This study evaluated the bondstrength of a polymer-infiltrated-ceramic-network to zirconia using two adhesive cement systems: Panavia 21 and Multilink Automix. Lithium disilicate and feldspathic porcelain were also tested as reference CAD-On materials. Long beams (3x6x40 mm³) of zirconia and short beams (3x6x15 mm³) of the CAD-On materials were prepared. Zirconia and each CAD-On material were bonded in a crossbeam arrangement and subjected to a modified tensile bond-strength test. Half of the samples in each group (n=10) were tested 5 days after bonding (baseline) and the remaining (n=10) underwent aging (50,000 thermocycles at 5°C and 55°C) prior to bond-strength testing. The effects of material, cement, and aging on the tensile bond-strength were tested using a three-way ANOVA. The reference lithium disilicate/Multilink system showed no significant differences in bond strength compared to polymer-infiltrated-ceramic-network and porcelain. The long-term retention of polymer-infiltrated-ceramic-network was not statistically different compared to the baseline values and the two reference materials. With comparable bond strength between all materials, polymer-infiltrated-ceramic-network is the favorable choice for CAD-On to zirconia copings and implant-abutments due to its superior resistance to fatigue fracture relative to porcelain.",The European journal of prosthodontics and restorative dentistry,10.1922/EJPRD_2332Lee12
Evaluation of Various Polishing Systems for Lithium Disilicate Glass-Ceramics,"Copyright© 2022 Dennis Barber Ltd.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the surface roughness of lithium disilicates (LS2s) polished using various polishing systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two types of LS2 (A, Amber Mill and E, IPS e.max CAD) were polished using LS2-specific polishing systems (L-Edenta, L-Jota), a zirconia-specific polishing system (Z-Jota), and a conventional ceramic polishing system (P-Shofu) (n = 8 per group). The compositions of different polishing systems were analyzed using EDS. Surface roughness was measured using confocal laser scanning microscopy and analyzed using EDS and SEM. ANOVA and Tukey's tests were used for the statistical analyses (p = 0.05). RESULTS: The polishing systems were mainly composed of C, O, and Si. The L-Jota group exhibited rougher surfaces than the other groups. Amber Mill exhibited higher surface roughness than IPS e.max CAD (p⟨0.001). Among the polishing systems, the L-Jota group presented the highest roughness value (pp⟨0.001). The surface roughness of the AL-Jota group was higher than that of the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: A sufficiently smooth surface can be achieved without a LS2-specific polishing system. Further, the same polishing system can have different effects depending on the type of LS2.",The European journal of prosthodontics and restorative dentistry,10.2298/SOS2203249G
Peculiarities of Glass Ceramics Formation from Red Clay– Cullet–Waste Activated Sludge–Hematite Mixtures,"© 2022 Authors.In the work, an analysis of the phase formation process proceeding in a quaternary red clay–low-melting cullet–iron oxide (Fe2 O3 )–WAS (waste activated sludge) system in treatment at 1000° C in air has been performed. It has been established that, in sintering of the mixtures, porous ceramics consisting of a glass phase alloyed with iron ions with inclusions of cristobalite, iron-containing silicates of complex composition, α-Fe2O3, and an insignificant amount of Fe3 O4 forms.

Study on Structure and Properties of High CaO Content Cao-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 Glass-ceramics 高CaO含量CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2微晶玻璃的结构和性能研究,"© 2022, Editorial Department of Wuhan University of Technology. All right reserved.The effect of CaO content and heat treatment temperature on the structure and crystallization behavior of CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 was studied. Through the DSC analysis of basic glass, the heat treatment process of glass was established. The structure and properties of glass-ceramics were studied by XRD, FE-SEM, bending resistance and hardness test. The results show that when the content of CaO% in the basic glass was between 28% and 36%, the glass-ceramics with Ca2Al(AlSiO7) as the main crystal phase could be prepared. With the increase of CaO content and heat treatment temperature, the precipitation of crystalline phase was more favorable, and the content of microcrystalline phase increased. Under the same heat treatment conditions, the flexural strength of glass-ceramics increased from 83.3 MPa to 91.6 MPa with the increase of CaO content in the base glass. The appearance and increase of microcrystalline phase were beneficial to the improvement of hardness properties of glass ceramics. The Vickers hardness range of glass ceramics was 849~871.6 HV.",Wuhan Ligong Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Wuhan University of Technology,10.1039/d2ce00447j
Oriented attachment and aggregation as a viable pathway to self-assembled organic/inorganic hybrid materials,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Organic-inorganic composite materials with tailored properties can be designed in the lab through bio-inspired approaches. In this context, we exploited the particle-based crystallisation process of calcium sulfate, a technologically important mineral, to hybridise inorganic and organic matter. We identified and synthesised an organic polymer showing strong affinity to bind to the surfaces of mineral precursors as well as intrinsic tendency to self-organise. Subsequently, polymer-coated building units were allowed to self-assemble via oriented attachment, aggregation and phase transformation, which produced ordered superstructures where the organic polymer is intercalated between the subunits and surrounds the hybrid core as a shell. This specific architecture across multiple length scales leads to unique mechanical properties, comparable to those of natural biominerals. Thus, our results devise a straightforward pathway to prepare organic-inorganic hybrid structures via bottom-up self-assembly processes innate to the crystallisation of the inorganic phase. This approach can likely be transferred to other inorganic minerals, affording next-generation materials for applications in the construction sector, biomedicine and beyond.",CrystEngComm,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c02342
Mechanochemical Lithium Extraction and Zeolite Synthesis from End-of-Life Glass-Ceramics,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium has become a strategic element, as it plays a crucial role in battery technology. Therefore, many efforts are being made to extract lithium from primary sources, while lithium recycling is almost nonexistent. In this paper, we report on a novel alkaline mechanochemical approach for the recycling of end-of-life glass-ceramics, which involves lithium extraction, zeolite synthesis, desilication, and lithium precipitation. Special attention has been paid to a holistic approach, with each byproduct having a designated application. Optimal parameters for lithium extraction such as sodium hydroxide concentration, rotational speed, and ball-to-powder ratio were achieved at 7 mol/L, 600 rpm, and 50:1 g/g, respectively, resulting in high yields of 83.8% (60 min) and 92.4% (120 min). Desilication of the solution resulted in a removal efficiency of 96.3% with calcium silicate as a value-added byproduct. Lithium could be recovered as phosphate with a high purity by adding phosphoric acid. Moreover, the zeolites synthesized during this investigation were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and N2adsorption/desorption analysis. In addition, selected zeolite samples were investigated as potential adsorbents for the removal of heavy metal ions (Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+) from aqueous solutions.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132546
Direct reduction of copper slag using rubber seed oil as a reductant: Iron recycling and thermokinetics,"© 2022Copper slag has potential economic and environmental benefits and there is a need for further clean utilization. The traditional recovery methods have the disadvantages of high energy consumption and low Fe recovery ratio. A strategy is proposed for the clean and efficient recovery of Fe from copper slag by deep reduction using rubber seed oil as a reductant. The reduction experiments and thermokinetics analysis are conducted to explore the reaction behavior between rubber seed oil and copper slag. The results show that the Fe recovery ratio of the copper slag is 91.85% and the Fe grade is 95.66% under the optimal conditions for roasting reduction. The process of recycling Fe from copper slag produces new secondary waste residue. Secondary waste residue can be used as a partial starting material for the synthesis of glass-ceramics. The reduction reaction mechanism of copper slag is transformed with increasing temperature. Limiting surface reaction (n = 2) is the restrictive step for the direct reduction reaction region and one-dimension diffusion is the restrictive step for the smelting reduction reaction region. The activation energy of the direct reduction reaction region and smelting reduction reaction region are 16.64 kJ/mol and 13.68 kJ/mol, respectively. This research provides an important approach to the clean utilization of copper slag.",Journal of Cleaner Production,10.1016/j.jmst.2021.11.063

A 3-Year Clinical Evaluation of Endodontically Treated Posterior Teeth Restored with Resin Nanoceramic Computer-Aided Design/ComputerAided Manufacture (CAD/CAM)-Fabricated Partial Crowns,"© Med Sci Monit, 2022.Background: We aimed to investigate the clinical effects of resin nanoceramic (RNC) computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) partial crowns on posterior teeth after root canal treatment over a 3-year period. Material/Methods: A total of 132 posterior teeth restored with CAD/CAM partial crowns were placed in 128 patients. The observation group (n=66) was restored with RNC restorations, while the control group received lithium disilicate-based glass ceramic (LDGC) CAD restorations. Using Fédération dentaire internationale (FDI) World Dental Federation clinical criteria, 2 calibrated evaluators examined the performance of the restorations at baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. The Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test were adopted to analyze the survival rate. The influence of potential risk factors on the main pattern of failure was studied by univariate Cox regression analysis (a=0.05). Results: At the 3-year followup, the survival rate of the partial crowns was 83.1% in the RNC group, and 93.5% in the LDGC group (P=0.061). Failures were caused by debonding (66.7%), restoration fracture (26.6%), and tooth fracture (6.7%). No significant differences were found between the 2 materials at 36 months, except for the parameters of ""surface luster""(P=0.002) and ""occlusal contour and wear""(P=0.009). The RNC group was significantly more likely to debond than the LDGC group (hazard ratio=9.22 [1.17,72.74], P=0.01). Conclusions: RNC CAD/CAM-fabricated partial crowns are a potential clinical alternative for endodontically treated posterior teeth, with a survival rate of 83.1% at the 3-year followup. The main pattern of failure was debonding, which might be influenced by surface pretreatment of the RNC material.",Medical Science Monitor,10.3290/j.qi.b3045089
"Influence of cement shade, ceramic thickness, and airborne-particle abrasion of titanium surface on the final color of monolithic lithium disilicate glass-ceramic hybrid-abutment systems in vitro","OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of the ceramic thickness, cement shade, and airborne-particle abrasion of the titanium on the final color of titanium base cemented lithium disilicate glass-ceramic restorations. METHOD AND MATERIALS: In total, 144 lithium disilicate glass-ceramic disks of three thicknesses (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mm) were cemented to airborne-particle-abraded and non-airborne-particle-abraded titanium disks with six adhesive resin cements. The color measurements were performed with a clinical spectrophotometer. The mean and standard deviation of evaluated ΔE values were calculated. A three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for analyzing the data. Statistical analyses were computed with a significance level of α = .05 using a statistical software program (Minitab 17, Minitab). RESULTS: The 0.5- and 1-mm-thick ceramic specimens cemented with Panavia V5 Opaque showed the lowest ΔE values when cemented on both non-airborne-particle-abraded (5.62 ± 1.66, 3.15 ± 1.28) and airborne-particle-abraded (5.55 ± 0.86, 3.16 ± 0.49) surfaces, while the highest values were seen in the groups cemented with RelyX U200 A2 (29.22 ± 0.83, 17.23 ± 0.45) and Panavia V5 A2 (29.94 ± 1.17, 16.71 ± 0.44) on airborne-particle-abraded surfaces. For the 1.5-mm-thick ceramics, the lowest ΔE values were seen when Multilink MO 0 cement was used on non-airborne-particle-abraded surfaces (1.56 ± 0.29) and when Panavia V5 Opaque was used on airborne-particle-abraded surfaces (1.56 ± 0.66). The highest values were seen when RelyX U200 A2 (9.77 ± 1.13), PA2 (9.24 ± 0.25), and Multilink HO 0 (9.19 ± 1.33) were used on airborne-particle-abraded surfaces, and when Multilink HO 0 (9.61 ± 1.70) was used on non-airborne-particle-abraded surfaces. The 1-mm-thick ceramics cemented with Multilink HO 0 showed higher ΔE values (12.05 ± 1.99) for airborne-particle-abraded and non-airborne-particle-abraded (12.58 ± 1.06) than thinner (0.5 mm) or thicker (1.5 mm) ceramics. CONCLUSION: Thinnest ceramic superstructures resulted in the highest ΔE values. Cements that mask the underlying color reflect their own shade under thin superstructures. Airborne-particle abrasion of titanium surfaces increases the grayish reflectance if cement shade does not have the color masking ability.","Quintessence international (Berlin, Germany : 1985)",10.1039/d2ra03235j
"A study of bioactive glass-ceramic's mechanical properties, apatite formation, and medical applications","© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Apparently, bioactive glass-ceramics are made by doing a number of steps, such as creating a microstructure from dispersed crystals within the residual glass, which provides high bending strength, and apatite crystallizes on surfaces of glass-ceramics when calcium ions are present in the blood. Apatite crystals grow on the glass and ceramic surfaces due to the hydrated silica. These materials are biocompatible with living bone in a matter of weeks, don't weaken mechanically or histologically, and exhibit good osteointegration as well as mechanical properties that are therapeutically relevant, such as fracture toughness and flexural strength.

Wave-transparent LAS enabling superior bandwidth electromagnetic wave absorption of a 2D pitaya carbon slice,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Wave-transparent lithium aluminosilicate glass-ceramic (LAS) nanofillers are confirmed to be effective in regulating the electromagnetic parameters to satisfy the impedance matching characteristic and enhance the electromagnetic wave loss ability. Herein, a new pitaya slice hierarchical configuration of a 2D LAS/carbon sheet electromagnetic wave absorber was prepared by an effective protocol using an ammonium nitrate-assisted self-polymerization and in situ blown strategy. The obtained 2D pitaya hierarchical configuration exhibited excellent microwave absorption performance with an RL of −55.26 dB and a wide effective absorption bandwidth (≤-10 dB) of 8.21 GHz, covering the whole Ku-band (12-18 GHz) with a low mass adding of only 9.2 wt%. The absorbing mechanism demonstrated that the interfacial polarization, Debye dipolar relaxation, and well-matched characteristic impedance play important roles in improving the microwave absorption properties of the 2D pitaya slice hierarchical configuration. This paper may provide a new route for constructing an effective absorbing network of 2D pitaya slice hierarchical configuration, realizing ultra-low filling and broadband microwave performance.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c02142
Deciphering Fast Ion Transport in Glasses: A Case Study of Sodium and Silver Vitreous Sulfides,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.High-capacity solid-state batteries are promising future products for large-scale energy storage and conversion. Sodium fast ion conductors including glasses and glass ceramics are unparalleled materials for these applications. Rational design and tuning of advanced sodium sulfide electrolytes need a deep insight into the atomic structure and dynamics in relation with ion-transport properties. Using pulsed neutron diffraction and Raman spectroscopy supported by first-principles simulations, we show that preferential diffusion pathways in vitreous sodium and silver sulfides are related to isolated sulfur Siso, that is, the sulfur species surrounded exclusively by mobile cations with a typical stoichiometry of M/Siso ≈ 2. The Siso/Stot fraction appears to be a reliable descriptor of fast ion transport in glassy sulfide systems over a wide range of ionic conductivities and cation diffusivities. The Siso fraction increases with mobile cation content x, tetrahedral coordination of the network former and, in case of thiogermanate systems, with germanium disulfide metastability and partial disproportionation, GeS2 → GeS + S, leading to the formation of additional sulfur, transforming into Siso. A research strategy enabling to achieve extended and interconnected pathways based on isolated sulfur would lead to glassy electrolytes with superior ionic diffusion.",Inorganic Chemistry,10.1016/j.compstruct.2022.115781
A mechanistic predictive model for ultrasound guided insertion process of Ø 0.11 mm Z-pins,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe insertion of finer Z-pins is a key issue for utilization of their reinforcement potential in Z-pinned composite laminates. This paper aims to reveal the insertion mechanisms of the ultrasound guided insertion process of Ø 0.11 mm Z-pins. Taking into account the fibre deformation, fibre–matrix interface, needle tip cutting and needle-prepreg contact, a new mechanical model is proposed to predict the change of insertion force during the insertion process. It is found that the application of ultrasonic vibration can minimize frictional effect and reduce fibre fracture, thus significantly decreasing the insertion force. The traditional two-phase insertion mechanism is transformed into single-phase insertion mechanism due to ultrasonic vibration. Based on this model, the effects of process parameters (including vibration amplitude, vibration frequency, feed rate and needle geometry) on the insertion force can be determined. Then Z-pin insertion experiments are performed on the prepreg sample to verify the proposed model. Results show that the model can capture the insertion mechanisms during the ultrasound guided insertion and predictions are in excellent agreement with the experimental measurements.",Composite Structures,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121666
Preparation and Characterization of a new Glass-Ceramic glaze for Ti6Al4V Alloy,"© 2022A new silicate-based glass-ceramic coating (51SiO2-10Al2O3-5ZrO2-2Y2O3-20B2O3-7Na2O-5K2O in mol %) was prepared, especially for improving tribological properties along with the soulless metallic outward appearance of Ti6Al4V alloy. For this, the based glass composition was designed so that there would be no need to use a bond coat or pre-preparation like oxidation of the beneath substrate before the coating process. Here, the effect of different holding times of 40, 80 and 120min at firing temperature of 900˚C on the physical and mechanical properties was inspected. The physical properties of the coating layers were characterized by means of X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) equipped with EDS and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and also the mechanical properties of the coated samples were investigated by Nanoindentation, Vickers microhardness, and tribological experiments. The results revealed that the holding time of 120min at the firing temperature of 900˚C can be considered as the optimum point for sintering and crystallization this glass-ceramic coating; holding the coated samples below 40min at this firing temperature led to a porous structure due to insufficient time to outgoing of gaseous bubbles, and also above 960˚C a cracked structure due to substrate α/β transformation. Detection of Ti5Si3 phase in XRD analysis can be considered as a positive sign of formation of a chemical bonding between the coating and the beneath substrate. By depositing the coating layer, the Vickers microhardness improved from 4.2GPa for the bare substrate to 9.9GPa for the coated sample. Additionally, the wear sliding test revealed that the weight loss of the coated samples after 300m was reduced approximately 14 times than the bare Ti6Al4V substrates.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnucmat.2022.153783
Triple ion beam irradiation of glass-ceramic materials for nuclear fusion technology,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The analysis of the radiation damage associated with energetic neutrons is a key factor for the application of glass-ceramics as joining materials in nuclear fusion plants. Triple ion beam irradiation is, currently, the only way to emulate the displacement damage and the effects of transmutation products induced by high energy neutrons at elevated doses by producing a high level of displacements per atom (dpa) and implanting high concentrations of low solubility gases on the glass-ceramic microstructure. In this paper, we investigate calcia-alumina glass-ceramics in which the damage expected in the working conditions of a nuclear fusion plant were reproduced by simultaneous irradiation with Si, He and H ions at different temperatures. TEM analysis of irradiated calcia-alumina samples shows amorphization (due to the Si beam) and partial recrystallization of the irradiated portion and the formation of He bubbles/cavities. The irradiation temperature plays a prominent role in determining the induced damage in terms of recrystallization, phase mixing and bubble size, density and aggregation.",Journal of Nuclear Materials,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.342
Performance of glass-ceramic-based lightweight aggregates manufactured from waste glass and muck,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Lightweight aggregates (LWAs) with microcrystalline diopside as the main constituent were prepared in this study. Waste glass and waste muck were used as the main raw materials, and the formula was designed according to the chemical composition of diopside, rather than using the Riley scheme. The effects of the glass content and nucleating agent on the mechanical properties, mineral composition, and microstructure of LWAs were studied. The results indicated that the presence of diopside crystallites can significantly improve the mechanical properties of LWAs. With an increase in the glass content from 0 wt % to 70 wt %, the strength of the LWAs increased from 12.21 MPa to 19.31 MPa with similar densities in the range of 1.667–1.687 g/cm3. The addition of a nucleating agent has a fluxing effect and promotes the formation and growth of diopside, which provides aggregates with high strength and low density. For example, the addition of CaF2 decreased the density of the LWAs from 1.687 g/cm3 to 1.461 g/cm3 and increased the strength from 17.59 MPa to 20.81 MPa under the same calcination regime. The effect of the pore structure on the mechanical properties of the LWA in this experiment was far less than that of the crystal phase composition. With the addition of a nucleating agent, the diopside was co-precipitated from both the muck and glass. If no nucleating agent is added, diopside mainly precipitates from glass, and muck mainly forms a glass phase.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121700
The Ga20Ge20Se60 glass-ceramics as a promising long-wave IR optical material,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The Ga20Ge20Se60 chalcogenide glass-ceramics with a crystalline phase volume fraction of 50–55%, an average crystal size of 2–5 μm, and a transparency of 50–65% in the spectral range of 7–16 μm (at 2 mm sample thickness) are prepared. The features of phase formation during glass-forming melt quenching and subsequent annealing are studied. In samples quenched in water from 750 to 850 °C, Ga40-xGexSe60 (x = 20–30) solid solutions with a cubic unit cell are formed. Upon quenching from 700 °C, solid solutions isostructural to monoclinic Ga2Se3 are formed. Annealing of glass-ceramics at 480 °C leads to the decomposition of the cubic phase and the appearance of mixed GaGeSe3. Fracture toughness, elastic modulus, and abrasive resistance increase with increasing gallium content in GaxGe40-xSe60 (x = 5–20) samples. The reasons for the high transparency of Ga20Se20Se60 glass-ceramics in the long-wave infrared range and its dependence on the production conditions are established and discussed.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121703
Preparation and characterization of foamed glass-ceramics based on waste glass and slow-cooled high-titanium blast furnace slag using borax as a flux agent,"© 2022Foamed glass-ceramics were prepared at 1000 °C through the one-step sintering process by applying waste glass and slow-cooled high-titanium blast furnace slag as raw materials. This study investigated the effects of borax as the flux agent on the crystalline phases, microstructure, and properties of foamed glass-ceramics, respectively. It was found that the borax would decrease the system's softening temperature and viscosity, thus enhancing the foaming and crystallizing process. Besides, the XRD results showed that the main crystal types of foamed glass-ceramics presented no difference with different contents of borax addition, but their crystallinity and crystal morphology differed. With the increasing borax content, the porosity and water absorption increased, while the volume density, thermal conductivity, and compressive strength all decreased. In particular, the sample added with 6 wt% borax exhibited the optimal comprehensive properties. This study provided a practical guideline for effectively reusing solid industrial wastes to produce foamed glass-ceramics.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121692
High efficiency near infrared emission from Pb1-xSrxSe Quantum dots in lithium aluminosilicate glass-ceramics,"© 2022Pb1-xSrxSe quantum dots (QDs) were prepared in Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 (LAS) glass-ceramics with 0–2.0 mol% SrO by conventional melt-quenching method. The near-infrared photoluminescence and photodarkening properties of Pb1-xSrxSe QDs in LAS glass-ceramics were studied. Upon the heat treatments of 490–550 °C for 10 h, there are LiAlO2 nanocrystals and PbSe QDs co-existed in the glassy matrix without SrO, and 1024–1745 nm near infrared emission from PbSe QDs were realized. With the increasing of SrO concentration from 0 to 2 mol%, the absorption wavelengths blue-shifted from 1738 to 1380 nm at 540 °C, the PL peak wavelengths blue-shifted from 1788 to 1538 nm at 540 °C. The blue-shifts are attributed to the increasing bandgap by incorporation of Sr2+ ions into PbSe crystalline lattice. Pb1-xSrxSe QDs display better photoinduced anti-darkening properties than pure PbSe QDs with the increasing of pumping power, and the Pb1-xSrxSe QDs embedded in the LAS glass with 2.0 mol% SrO shows the highest photoluminescence quantum yield of ∼36.9%.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.292
Crystallization behavior and mechanical properties of high strength mica-containing glass-ceramics from granite wastes,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The high-strength mica-containing glass-ceramics were prepared from granite wastes by bulk crystallization. The influences of SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio (S/A = 7.72, 9.62, 12.58, 17.82 and 29.67) on the crystallization behavior, microstructure, mechanical properties and machinability of glass-ceramics were investigated. The results demonstrated that the polymerization degree of the glass network decreased with the S/A ratio increasing, which further caused the decrease in glass transition temperature and crystallization temperatures. The increase in the S/A ratio promoted the precipitation of diopside, hectorite, kalsilite and tainiolite in glass-ceramics when the samples were heated at 750 °C, while inhibiting the precipitation of forsterite. For the glass-ceramics crystallized at 800 and 900 °C, the main crystalline phases transformed from diopside, forsterite, and nepheline to diopside, kalsilite, and tainiolite, with the S/A ratio increasing. As the SiO2 gradually replaced Al2O3, the morphology of crystals changed from lamellar to granular, while the mean size of crystals reduced. The Vickers-Hardness values of glass-ceramics crystallized at 800 and 900 °C ascended with S/A ratio rising, and the values were above 6.30 GPa. The bending strength of most glass-ceramics is stable between 90 and 140 MPa, among which the maximum bending strength is 133.28 ± 14.81 MPa. The fracture toughness of the glass-ceramic crystallized at 800 and 900 °C declined, while that at 700 °C increased with a larger S/A ratio. Glass-ceramics after heat-treated at 900 °C with S/A ratio of 9.62 had the largest fracture toughness of 3.28 ± 0.15 MPa m1/2. In preliminary tests of machinability, glass-ceramic after heat-treated at 900 °C with S/A ratio of 9.62 showed better results.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.132370

Preparation and sealing effects of Mg–Al–Si–Ba–O-based glass-ceramic coatings on NTC thermistors,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Herein, Mg–Al–Si–Ba–O-based glass ceramics were studied as potential candidates to protect Mn–Co–Ni–O-based negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors at high temperatures such as 900 °C. The ceramics were prepared in three glass formulations (1#: 15MgO–15Al2O3-44.7SiO2–25BaO, 2#: 17MgO–17Al2O3–41SiO2–25BaO and 3#: 17MgO–17Al2O3–41SiO2–20BaO–5Y2O3 (in mol%)) and their glass-transition temperatures (Tg) were determined using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the parent glasses and glass-ceramic coatings. The sealing effects of the glass ceramics were examined by conducting an insulation test. The glass-ceramic sealing structures were subjected to 1000 thermal shock cycles at temperatures varying from room temperature to 900 °C. Notably, the sealing structure of glass-ceramic coating 1# was compact at a Tg of 760.9 °C. The glass-ceramic coatings effectively maintained the NTC properties of the sensitive ceramics in all three formulations. Interestingly, the glass-ceramic coating 3# containing Y2O3 demonstrated an increase in electrical resistance. Both the NTC thermistors coated with 1# and 2# glass formulations successfully passed 1000 thermal shock cycles without visible failures, and their resistance change ratios were well below the requisite 20%.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.350
High stability superhydrophobic glass-ceramic surface with micro–nano hierarchical structure,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Inspired by the surface structure of lotus leaves, micro–nano hierarchical surface structures have been widely used for designing superhydrophobic surfaces. However, the conventionally designed superhydrophobic surface structures are fragile. In this study, a layer of micron-sized mullite whiskers was grown using molten salt on the surface of BaAl2Si2O8 (BAS) glass ceramics. Subsquently, SiO2 nanoparticles modified with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane were sprayed onto the whisker layer to form a superhydrophobic surface. The nanoparticles exhibit superhydrophobicity, which is protected by the whisker layer containing pores and bulges. This prohibits direct contact between the nanoparticles and external objects. Contact and rolling angle tests indicated that the surface contact angle of the micro–nano hierarchical structure is 158° and the rolling angle is less than 10°. The stability of the superhydrophobic surface was tested through ultraviolet light, long-time immersion in solutions with various pH values, water scouring, and sandpaper abrasion. The results showed that the contact angle is greater than 150°. This study is expected to provide a simple and effective method for fabricating superhydrophobic surfaces on ceramics on a large scale.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.165126
Original KGd2F7 nanocrystals in fluoro-oxide glass ceramics by Dy3+/Sm3+ co-doped for white light emission,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Serial fluoro-oxide glass ceramics (GCs) containing 0.6 mol% Dy3+ and various Sm3+ from 0 mol% to 1.5 mol% co-doped novel KGd2F7 nanocrystals were firstly fabricated through high temperature melt-quenching method. Then the microscopic structure of the GCs was revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). And the rare-earth ions (RE3+) of Dy3+ and Sm3+ were successfully doped in monoclinic-phase KGd2F7 nanocrystals, which can be verified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mappings. The photoluminescence spectra of the GCs were probed systematically utilizing 365 nm excitation light. The yellow (573 nm), green (486 nm), and red (648 nm) multiple emissions were observed in the co-doped GCs, and the intensity of red became stronger because of the higher Sm3+ doping concentrations. This contribution of multiple emissions is due to the co-absorption of both Dy3+ and Sm3+ for 365 nm and the presence of energy transfer (ET). Moreover, the ET between Dy3+ and Sm3+ was confirmed from the variations of emission spectra and measured decay curves of emissions. Furthermore, the maximum energy transfer efficiency (ETE) from Dy3+ to Sm3+ can reach ~60.34% and the internal quantum yield (QY) is computed to be around 31.82% upon excitation of 365 nm. The chromaticity coordinates (CIE (Commission Internationale de L′Eclairage)− 1931) of the GCs can be tuned effectively through changing activator concentrations. Ideal white light emission is at the CIE (0.3357, 0.3342), which was achieved for 0.6 mol% Dy3+/0.9 mol% Sm3+ doped GCs sample. The results indicated that Dy3+/Sm3+ co-doped GCs with both high thermal and chemical-physical stabilities have strong potential application in white light-emitting diodes and fluorescent display devices.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.315

Near-infrared responsive Z-scheme heterojunction with strong stability and ultra-high quantum efficiency constructed by lanthanide-doped glass,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lanthanide-doped near-infrared (NIR) photocatalyst still obstructed by the less impressive photocatalytic efficiency and stability. In this work, we report a novel strategy by introducing the lanthanide-doped ferroelectric perovskites of SiTiO3 and Sr2Bi4Ti4O15 into the glass-ceramic (GC), then an efficient and stable NIR photocatalyst was fabricated through the method of facile in-situ HCl etching GC. The results show that Sr2Bi4Ti4O15, SrTiO3, and BiOCl were exposed to the superficial coating of the core-shell structured photocatalyst and constructed Z-scheme heterojunction, the heterojunction with built-in electric field could significantly facilitate the charge carriers separation and harvest NIR light for photocatalytic reaction simultaneously. The evident increase of Lewis basic sites over defect-rich photocatalyst is found, the •O2- and •OH radicals are generated. During the degradation of norfloxacin (NOR) under NIR light irradiation for 90 min, the NOR degradation rate is 86% (TOC removal rate is 30.7%), the high apparent quantum yield of 2.3% is achieved.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,10.33263/BRIAC124.56105624
Preparation of porous poly(Lactic acid)/tricalcium phosphate composite scaffolds for tissue engineering,"© 2021 by the authors.The development of bioactive and composite materials for tissue engineering applications is being investigated worldwide. Many approaches have been published by including combinations of resorbable polymers with hydroxyapatite (HA), tricalcium phosphate (TCP), bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics in different scaffolds architectures. Taking into account these antecedents, porous polylactic acid (PLA)/TCP composites were fabricated by employing dissolution-leaching technic from PLA/chloroform solution (10, 15, and 20 wt % of TCP). Composite scaffolds exhibited porosity values 1.3 times higher when compared to PLA foams. Their bioactive response of the composite foams after immersion in a simulated body fluid (SBF) was studied by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR). By XRD analysis, diffraction peaks attributed to hydroxyapatite deposition were observed; and by FTIR-ATR, new absorption bands corresponding to HA were detected. Regarding mechanical properties, an increasing tendency on elastic Young's modulus values was observed at higher TCP concentrations. These results envision the feasibility of using these composites as precursors for bone tissue materials engineering.",Biointerface Research in Applied Chemistry,10.11896/cldb.21040122
Effect of Sintering Temperature on Crystallization Properties of Glass-ceramics Prepared from Asbestos Mine Waste Rock 烧结温度对石棉矿山废石制备微晶玻璃析晶性能的影响,"© 2022 Cailiao Daobaoshe/ Materials Review. All rights reserved.The glass-ceramics with forsterite as the main crystalline phase and enstatite as the secondary crystalline phase were prepared by direct sintering method using waste rock from Dahonggou asbestos mine as raw material. The effects of the sintering temperature (1 150-1 325 ℃) on the crystalline phase, microstructure and properties of crystallization of glass-ceramics were investigated by using various modern analytical testing methods. The results show that with the increase of sintering temperature, the type of crystalline phase is not affected, but the content changes. The content of enstatite gradually increases, and the content of forsterite slightly decreases; the grains in glass-ceramics grow up, and the interwoven occlusal structure is formed among the grains. The glass-ceramics prepared at the sintering temperature of 1 300 ℃ show the optimal physical and chemical properties, of which the linear shrinkage rate, the volume density and the flexural strength are the largest at 11.2%, 2.78 g/cm3 and 95 MPa, respectively, and the water absorption is the smallest at 0.03%.",Cailiao Daobao/Materials Reports,10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c04878
Carbonene Fibers: Toward Next-Generation Fiber Materials,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.

Zr doped NASICON-type LATP glass-ceramic as a super-thin coating onto deoxidized carbon wrapped CNT-S cathode for lithium-sulphur battery,"© 2022Rechargeable lithium–sulphur (Li–S) battery is one of the best candidates for the next generation of high-energy-storage systems. However, widespread application of Li–S battery is being restricted by the solubility and migration of the reaction intermediates in both discharge and charge processes. In this paper, we report a dual-phase electrolyte-based Li-S battery with high capacity and safety performance. With a lithium superionic conductor coating on the deoxidized carbon wrapped carbon nanotube-sulphur (CNT-S) cathode, there is no obvious decay in capacity during the long-term cycles for the assembled dual-phase electrolyte-based Li–S battery, and the discharge capacities achieved after the fortieth cycle are observed to return back to the level of the initial cycle. The sub-micron crystallized NASICON-type glass-ceramic powders with high purity are synthesized by a modified sol-gel method. Compared to the best value reported recently, an order of magnitude enhancement in total conductivity under room temperature is obtained in the doped sample using the process. By introducing this super high lithium-ion conductor to the particular battery architecture and combining it with the developed high-performance positive electrode, the assembled dual-phase electrolyte-based Li–S battery exhibits an efficient utilization of active materials and outstanding high-rate discharge ability, which is promising for possible commercial exploitation and practical applications.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1039/d2cp01803a
"Erbium ion implantation into LiNbO3, Al2O3, ZnO and diamond - measurement and modelling - an overview","© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The presented overview deals with the study of the luminescence properties of lanthanide ions incorporated into different dielectric crystalline materials for use in photonics and optoelectronics. From the crystalline materials, non-centrosymmetric hexagonal crystals of LiNbO3, Al2O3 and ZnO, together with the centrosymmetric cubic crystal of diamond, were chosen. The above-mentioned materials represent a certain cross-section through various crystal structure geometries with different internal bonding of atoms which represent different crystal vicinity for the incorporated Er ions. During more than ten years of our research, each of the crystals was doped with erbium ions and the resulting structural and luminescence properties were studied in detail and compared between the mentioned crystalline materials to find similar behaviour for erbium ions in the different crystalline materials. To better understand the incorporation of erbium in the studied crystalline materials, theoretical simulations of different erbium-doped crystal models were carried out. In the calculations, cohesive energies of the structures and erbium defect-formation energies were compared in order to find the most favourable erbium positions in the crystals. Also, from the geometry optimization calculations, the optimal geometry arrangements in the vicinity of erbium ions in different crystals were studied and visualized. The results of the theoretical simulations confirmed the experimental results - i.e., from all the theoretical erbium-doped crystal models, the most stable structures contained erbium in the substitutional positions with octahedral oxygen coordination.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1021/acs.chemmater.2c00267
Artificial Intelligence-Aided Mapping of the Structure-Composition-Conductivity Relationships of Glass-Ceramic Lithium Thiophosphate Electrolytes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Lithium thiophosphates (LPSs) with the composition (Li2S)x(P2S5)1-xare among the most promising prospective electrolyte materials for solid-state batteries (SSBs), owing to their superionic conductivity at room temperature (>10-3S cm-1), soft mechanical properties, and low grain boundary resistance. Several glass-ceramic (gc) LPSs with different compositions and good Li conductivity have been previously reported, but the relationship among composition, atomic structure, stability, and Li conductivity remains unclear due to the challenges in characterizing noncrystalline phases in experiments or simulations. Here, we mapped the LPS phase diagram by combining first-principles and artificial intelligence (AI) methods, integrating density functional theory, artificial neural network potentials, genetic-algorithm sampling, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. By means of an unsupervised structure-similarity analysis, the glassy/ceramic phases were correlated with the local structural motifs in the known LPS crystal structures, showing that the energetically most favorable Li environment varies with the composition. Based on the discovered trends in the LPS phase diagram, we propose a candidate solid-state electrolyte composition, (Li2S)x(P2S5)1-x(x ∼0.725), that exhibits high ionic conductivity (>10-2S cm-1) in our simulations, thereby demonstrating a general design strategy for amorphous or glassy/ceramic solid electrolytes with enhanced conductivity and stability.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1002/app.52630
Vacuum formed bio-based composite materials using polyolefin and thermally modified wood powder,"© 2022 The Authors. Journal of Applied Polymer Science published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.For climate and sustainability reasons, there is an interest and incentive to produce plastic and rubber products with increased content of a bio-based component, preferably existing as an industrial by-product, for example, wood powder/sawdust. There are many studies on the making of wood-plastic composites, but hitherto very few consider vacuum forming as a processing technique, especially considering a biofiller. Here, the properties of a vacuum formed composite with thermally modified wood powder (with reduced water uptake) and a very ductile polyolefin, was reported. Surprisingly, even at a 15 wt% filler content, the composite remained ductile (extensibility of ca. 30%). The water uptake increased with increasing content of wood powder, but was never more than 5%. The water sorption kinetics indicated that the wood powder did not form a percolated continuous path through the material for easy access to the water, which led to a low water diffusivity (ca. 2 × 10−10 cm2 s−1). The calorimetric data showed that the biofiller, overall, did not affect the melting and crystallization behavior of the polymer matrix, nor the observed glass transition temperature. To conclude, vacuum forming was shown to be a viable technique for composites with a very ductile/elastic matrix and stiff fillers.",Journal of Applied Polymer Science,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.165010
Phase transition during nucleation process in calcium aluminate glass-ceramics manufactured from secondary aluminum dross,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Secondary aluminum dross is a solid waste discharged during aluminum processing and melting. Calcium aluminate glass-ceramics was manufactured from secondary aluminum dross without adding nucleating agent. Phase transition of glass-ceramics was studied. Nucleation temperature was set at 846 ℃ according to differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction results. Field-emission transmission electron microscopy was applied to observe microstructure of the thermally treated parent glass. During nucleation process, omphacite grew from glass network. Omphacite growth consisted of two steps: migration of silicon group and cation; growth of omphacite. After parent glass was thermally treated at 846 ℃ for 3 h, silicon group and cation migrated and formed silicon enrichment field. A little of omphacite crystal formed in silicon enrichment field. When thermal treatment time was increased to 12 h, more independent omphacite crystals grew in silicon enrichment field. The independent omphacite crystals grew larger and contacted with each other to form a large omphacite crystal. The large omphacite crystal became nucleus of glass-ceramics. Omphacite nucleation had two effects on crystallization of glass-ceramics. First, omphacite crystal became nucleus, which provided surface for growing crystals. Second, omphacite growth consumed silicon group in glass network, which decreased polymerization degree of glass network and promoted crystallization. In calcium aluminate glass-ceramics with silicon, omphacite crystal could act as the nucleus without additional nucleation agents.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.11901/1005.3093.2021.181
Effect of Graphitization Degree of Mesophase Pitch-based Carbon Fibers on Carbon Fiber/Al Interface Damage 中间相沥青基碳纤维石墨化度对 Cf/Al 界面损伤的影响,"© 2022 Chinese Journal of Materials Research. All rights reserved.Composite of carbon fiber (Cf) with Al-film (Cf/Al) was constructed by magnetron sputtering with mesophase pitch-based carbon fibers of different graphitization degrees as matrix and Al-plate as sputtering target. Then, the microstructure evolution of Cf /Al interface of the prepared composites was investigated, and the damage mechanism of Cf /Al interface was revealed in comparison to that prepared with polyacrylonitrile carbon fiber. The results show: With the increase of graphitization temperature, the size, the degree of orientation and graphitization of graphite micro-crystallites in mesophase asphalt based carbon fiber increased, whilst both of the reaction degree of Cf /Al interface and the damage of carbon fiber reduced. The damage of Cf /Al interface of the composites prepared with Cf of different graphitization degrees depends on the number of initial defects and the propagation of subsequent cracks in the carbon fiber. The graphitization treatment at 2400℃ and 2700℃ could facilitate the crack propagation through graphite micro-lamellas located in between mesophase asphalt-based carbon fibers, however after removing the Al-coating, the fiber damage was 5.19% and 3.70% higher than that of polyacrylonitrile carbon fiber respectively. After graphitization at 3000℃, the mesophase bituminous carbon fiber with higher chemical inertia could reduce the number of defects generated by interfacial reaction, whilst, after removing the Al-coating, the damage of the fiber was 1.85% lower than that of polyacrylonitrile carbon fiber.",Cailiao Yanjiu Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Materials Research,10.3390/ma15165759
Diffusion of Copper Ions in the Lattice of Substituted Hydroxyapatite during Heat Treatment,"© 2022 by the authors.The doping of hydroxyapatite with various substituent ions can give this material new and useful properties. Nonetheless, local distortions of structure after doping can change the properties of the material. In this work, the thermal stability of copper-substituted hydroxyapatite synthesized by the mechanochemical method was investigated. In situ diffraction analyses showed that copper ion diffusion during the heating of Cu-substituted hydroxyapatite promotes phase transformations in the substituted hydroxyapatite. The behavior of copper ions was studied in samples with ratios (Ca + Cu)/P = 1.75 and 1.67. It was found that in both cases, single-phase Cu-substituted hydroxyapatite with the general formula Ca10−xCux(PO4)6−y(CO3)y(OH)2−yOy is formed by the mechanochemical synthesis. When heated at approximately 600–700 °C, the lattice loses copper cations, but at higher temperatures, CuO diffusion into the hydroxyl channel takes place. Cuprate-substituted hydroxyapatite with the general formula Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2−2x(CuO2)x forms in this context. At 1200 °C, the sample is single-phase at (Ca + Cu)/P = 1.75. Nonetheless, slow cooling of the material leads to the emergence of a CuO phase, as in the case of (Ca + Cu)/P = 1.67, where the material contains not only CuO but also Cu-substituted tricalcium phosphate. In the manufacture of ceramic products from Cu-substituted hydroxyapatite, these structural transformations must be taken into account, as they alter not only thermal but also biological properties of such materials.",Materials,10.3390/coatings12081122
Surface Characterization of Current Dental Ceramics Using Scanning Electron Microscopic and Atomic Force Microscopic Techniques,"© 2022 by the authors.Dental ceramics is a highly esthetic material and its surface properties can impact its roughness, bonding properties, as well as strength and wear. The aim of the study is to analyze the surface characteristics by the determination of the roughness parameters of three dental ceramics used in computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technique: lithium disilicate (LS2), zirconium oxide-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS), and zirconium oxide (ZrO2), prepared using two different processing techniques, polishing (self-glaze) and glazing with three different glazes. Both glass ceramics, pre-crystallized LS2 and crystallized ZLS, were cut into disks, and the surface was ground and polished. Crystallization was performed for LS2 samples, while ZrO2 samples were fabricated using CAD/CAM and sintered. Then, the glaze was applied and the samples were reheated as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The contact surface topographies of the tested ceramics were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the roughness parameters: average surface roughness (Ra), root-mean-square roughness (Rq), and surface area difference (SAD) were evaluated. Changes in the morphological characteristics of the tested ceramics were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the surface chemical composition was determined by attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT—IR). In the spectroscopic analysis, a characteristic signal for ZrO2 was obtained for ZLS samples. A significant decrease in surface roughness was observed after glazing in all tested ceramics (p < 0.05). The abstract should be an objective representation of the article and it must not contain results that are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions.",Coatings,10.3390/jcm11164892
"Conventional, Speed Sintering and High-Speed Sintering of Zirconia: A Systematic Review of the Current Status of Applications in Dentistry with a Focus on Precision, Mechanical and Optical Parameters","© 2022 by the authors.The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of the technical and clinical outcomes of conventional, speed sintering and high-speed sintering protocols of zirconia in the dental field. Data on precision, mechanical and optical parameters were evaluated and related to the clinical performance of zirconia ceramic. The PICOS search strategy was applied using MEDLINE to search for in vitro and in vivo studies using MeSH Terms by two reviewers. Of 66 potentially relevant studies, 5 full text articles were selected and 10 were further retrieved through a manual search. All 15 studies included in the systematic review were in vitro studies. Mechanical, precision and optical properties (marginal and internal fit, fracture strength and modulus, wear, translucency and opalescence, aging resistance/hydrothermal aging) were evaluated regarding 3-, 4- and 5-YTZP zirconia material and conventional, high- and high-speed sintering protocols. Mechanical and precision results were similar or better when speed or high-speed sintering methods were used for 3-, 4- and 5-YTZP zirconia. Translucency is usually reduced when 3 Y-TZP is used with speed sintering methods. All types of zirconia using the sintering procedures performed mechanically better compared to lithium disilicate glass ceramics but glass ceramics showed better results regarding translucency.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,10.3390/ma15155234
Wear Behavior between Aesthetic Restorative Materials and Bovine Tooth Enamel,"© 2022 by the authors.Tooth enamel wear occurs because of daily mastication and occlusion. This study investigated the wear behavior of bovine teeth against aesthetic restorative materials in vitro. Abrader specimens were fabricated using four tooth-colored restorative materials (zirconia, lithium disilicate glass ceramic, dental porcelain, and resin composite), with bovine tooth enamel as a control. Flattened bovine tooth enamel was used as the substrate specimen. These materials were characterized by Vickers hardness tests and surface roughness measurements. Two-body wear tests between the abrader and substrate specimens were performed, and the worn topographies were evaluated using a contour-measuring instrument and 3D laser microscope. The restorative materials and bovine tooth enamel had similar surface roughness but different hardness and wear behaviors. Bovine teeth showed the largest wear in tooth–tooth contact as the abrader and substrate specimens. Compared to bovine teeth, zirconia, lithium disilicate glass ceramic, and dental porcelain showed greater hardness and less wear on their surfaces, and less substrate wear of the opposite tooth enamel. The lowest hardness resin composite showed intermediate wear on its surface, resulting in the lowest substrate wear. Accordingly, dentists should pay attention to the selection of restorative materials to reconstruct their morphologies owing to different wear behaviors.",Materials,10.3390/ma15155139
Powder 3D Printing of Bone Scaffolds with Uniform and Gradient Pore Sizes Using Cuttlebone-Derived Calcium Phosphate and Glass-Ceramic,"© 2022 by the authors.The pore geometry of bone scaffolds has a major impact on their cellular response; for this reason, 3D printing is an attractive technology for bone tissue engineering, as it allows for the full control and design of the porosity. Calcium phosphate materials synthesized from natural sources have recently attracted a certain interest because of their similarity to natural bone, and they were found to show better bioactivity than synthetic compounds. Nevertheless, these materials are very challenging to be processed by 3D printing due to technological issues related to their nanometric size. In this work, bone scaffolds with different pore geometries, with a uniform size or with a size gradient, were fabricated by binder jetting 3D printing using a biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) nanopowder derived from cuttlebones. To do so, the nanopowder was mixed with a glass-ceramic powder with a larger particle size (45–100 µm) in 1:10 weight proportions. Pure AP40mod scaffolds were also printed. The sintered scaffolds were shown to be composed mainly by hydroxyapatite (HA) and wollastonite, with the amount of HA being larger when the nanopowder was added because BCP transforms into HA during sintering at 1150 °C. The addition of bio-derived powder increases the porosity from 60% to 70%, with this indicating that the nanoparticles slow down the glass-ceramic densification. Human mesenchymal stem cells were seeded on the scaffolds to test the bioactivity in vitro. The cells’ number and metabolic activity were analyzed after 3, 5 and 10 days of culturing. The cellular behavior was found to be very similar for samples with different pore geometries and compositions. However, while the cell number was constantly increasing, the metabolic activity on the scaffolds with gradient pores and cuttlebone-derived powder decreased over time, which might be a sign of cell differentiation. Generally, all scaffolds promoted fast cell adhesion and proliferation, which were found to penetrate and colonize the 3D porous structure.",Materials,10.3390/ma15155187
Ag Nanocluster-Enhanced Scintillation Properties of Borophosphate Glasses Doped with CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots,"© 2022 by the authors.A novel and effective method to improve scintillation properties of glass-ceramics, such as intensity enhancement and decay-time shortening, is reported in this work. Compared with crystal scintillators, glass scintillators always have the problems of low efficiency and long decay; how to solve them has always been a scientific puzzle in the field of scintillation glass-ceramics. The plasma enhancement effect can be predicted to solve the above problems. Ag+ ions were diffused into glasses by ion exchange, and then Ag nanoparticles and CsPbBr3 quantum dots were formed by heat treatment. The structure of the CsPbBr3 perovskite consists of a series of shared corner PbBr6 octahedra with Cs ions occupying the cuboctahedral cavities. By using Ag and the plasma resonance effect, the photoluminescence intensity of CsPbBr3 quantum dot glasses was enhanced by 3 times, its radioluminescence intensity increased by 6.25 times, and its decay time was reduced by a factor of more than one. Moreover, the mechanism of photoluminescence and radioluminescence enhanced by Ag and plasma was discussed based on the experimental results and finite-difference time-domain method. We concluded that the increase in radioluminescence intensity was related to plasma enhancements and the energy exchange between Ag nanoclusters and CsPbBr3 quantum dots. Doping Ag is a valid means to improve the scintillation luminescence of CsPbBr3 quantum dot glasses, which can be applied in the field of scintillation.",Materials,10.1002/masy.202100455
Fracture strength of different veneers on polyetheretherketone (PEEK) frameworks in implant-supported single crowns,"Copyright©American Journal of Dentistry.PURPOSE: To evaluate the fracture strength of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) single crowns veneered with different materials produced by computer-aided design (CAD)-computer-aided manufacture (CAM) after aging. METHODS: 60 stainless-steel master dies were prepared with a 1 mm-wide deep chamfer. Sixty PEEK frameworks were produced with a CAD-CAM system for the right maxillary first molar tooth on the dies. PEEK frameworks were divided into six groups (n= 10) according to veneering materials (five CAD-CAM materials and a resin composite). Group ZR: monolithic zirconia (Upcera ST-Color); Group EC: lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD); Group LU: resin nano-ceramic (Lava Ultimate); Group VM: feldspathic ceramic (Vitablocs Mark II); Group VS: zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic (VITA Suprinity); and Group CR: indirect resin composite (Gradia). All samples were subjected to a fracture strength test in a universal test device after thermo-mechanical aging and then the results were analyzed statistically using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test. In addition, post-fracture analyses of all samples were performed with a stereomicroscope. RESULTS: The differences in fracture strength values of different veneer materials in single crowns with a PEEK framework were statistically significant (P< 0.05). Fracture strength was highest in Group ZR (1665 N), followed by Groups LU (1440 N), EC (1249 N), CR (918 N), VS (754 N), and VM (655 N). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: PEEK frameworks may have the potential to be used with many veneer materials of different content and properties in fixed partial prostheses.",American journal of dentistry,10.2109/jcersj2.22078
A Feasibility Study on Innovative Reinforced Modular Frames for Automotive Applications,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Vehicle frames can be considered the main stiffening component being, at the same time, functional hubs for all the other components assembly. Frames’ main goal is to absorb the static and dynamic loads acting on the vehicle, ensuring passengers’ safety. In this paper a feasibility study on an innovative modular frame concept is presented. An attempt has been made to design a modular frame by using customized additive manufacturable steel joints. Actually, standard frame structures are manufactured by welding separated tubes, making access to some internal areas of the vehicle very difficult where not impossible. Consequently, some maintenance operations become also challenging. The modular configuration solves these maintenance problems enabling, at the same time, to start thinking about multi-purposes vehicle configurations, which can be switched by simply changing the modules connected to a central cell. Reinforced panels have been, also, integrated into the modular frame, which contribute to torsional stiffness with an overall mass reduction. The concept of a modular frame with collaborating reinforced panels, has been preliminary demonstrated by means of numerical simulations within the ABAQUS FEM environment.

Potential of Using Agricultural Waste Composites as Thermal Insulation Material,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.A huge amount of waste is produced every day in the world and it is thrown away without giving them any new use. Agricultural wastes generated as a result of obtaining, processing, and consuming plant and animal products constitute a remarkable large part of this waste amount. Today, these wastes are used in the production of composites, and the composites produced from these wastes give positive results in durability, flexibility, and thermal insulation. Composite materials which are combination of different materials to create a new material with discrete properties than its ingredients have gained great importance with the increment of product variety thus the property requirement. In production process, it is now always possible to fulfill the requirements of the design with conventional engineering materials. Since composite materials have the ability of being tailorable they have been started to be used in many different application areas. Recently, the usage of such composite materials in the automotive field has been evaluated. In this review, the usage of composites produced from different agricultural wastes in thermal insulation has been examined. A detailed review of the past and recent research activities has been documented. The literature survey reveals that agricultural wastes can be a good candidate to be used as reinforcement or filler material in composites for thermal insulation purposes.",Macromolecular Symposia,10.3390/app12157885
Influence of Gold Nano Particles on Dielectric Features A.C. Conductivity and Dielectric Breakdown Strength of PbO-B2O3-SeO2:Ho2O3 Glass Ceramics,"© 2022 The Electrochemical Society (“ECS”). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.The objective of this study is to report the results of dielectric properties and dielectric breakdown strength (DBS) of PbO-B2O3-SeO2:Ho2O3 (PBSH) glass ceramics as functions of Au2O3 content and to correlate the results with spectroscopic properties. PBSH glass ceramics with traces of Au2O3 were fabricated and characterized with different techniques that include positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS). Several dielectric parameters and DBS were studied as functions of Au2O3 concentration. Observed increase of ϵ′ with Au2O3 content was attributed to a hike in the space charge polarization (scp) due to the increased concentration of structural imperfections. Dipolar relaxation phenomenon exhibited by electric moduli was analyzed using Cole-Cole plots. σ ac (a c, conductivity) showed an increasing tendency with Au2O3 content. Such increase was attributed to the polaronic exchange between two structural groups of SeO2. Inferences drawn from dielectric and DBS studies were found to be in agreement with different spectroscopic properties of these glass ceramics.",ECS Journal of Solid State Science and Technology,10.3788/LOP202259.1516022
Studies on δ-Bi2O3 Based Nanocrystalline Glass-Ceramics Stabilized at Room Temperature by Novel Methods,"© 2022 by the authors.This study demonstrated for the first time that it is possible to prepare nanocrystalline δ-Bi2O3 that is stable at room temperature by twin-rollers and free cooling methods, using a ceramic crucible. The phase composition of prepared samples and upper limit of the thermal stability of nanograins confined in an amorphous matrix were determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. The average size of crystallites and the microstructure of studied samples was determined by SEM and XRD methods. The average grain size varied from 38 to 85 nm, depending on the preparation technique; however, it was also observed that agglomerations consisted of smaller crystallites ca. 10–30 nm. Using the EDX method, it was found that a crucial role in the preparation of nanocrystalline δ-Bi2O3 glass-ceramics was played by Si and Al impurities and their glass forming oxides from ceramic crucible. By impedance spectroscopy (IS), the temperature dependencies of electric conductivity (via oxygen ions) were studied and the activation energies of conductivity were determined.",Applied Sciences (Switzerland),10.3788/LOP202259.1516014

Peculiarities of the Processing of Polycrystalline AlN Films on Glass-Ceramic and Si Substrates by Argon Cluster Ions,"© 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.Abstract: The peculiarities of the surface processing of polycrystalline aluminum-nitride films on glass-ceramic and silicon substrates grown under identical conditions are considered. Aluminum-nitride films are obtained using the magnetron sputtering of a pure aluminum target (99.99%) in nitrogen–argon plasma at a magnetron power of 700 W. The consumption of working gases is 10 sccm for nitrogen and 4 sccm for argon. The film thickness is determined using a quartz resonator inside the chamber of the magnetron setup. Atomic force microscopy is used to study the surface relief of the targets before and after treatment by argon cluster ions. Small single crystallites are shown to grow on the initial surfaces, the lateral size of which is in the range of 250–550 nm. The depth of target etching by argon cluster ions is determined. Cluster ions with low energy per atom are shown to have a high efficiency of surface smoothing. A comparison of the surface morphology and surface-roughness parameters of aluminum nitride on different substrates obtained using atomic force microscopy is carried out. It is shown that aluminum nitride on silicon is smoothed more efficiently than on a glass-ceramic substrate.",Journal of Surface Investigation,10.1007/s10854-022-08758-w
Glass Ceramics Based on Silicon Dioxide as a Promising Material for Use in Nuclear Power Engineering,"© 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.Abstract: This paper considers options for using glass ceramics based on silicon dioxide as a promising material for nuclear power engineering, in particular, as shells and containers when handling liquid radioactive waste (LRW) and solid radioactive waste (SRW); canisters, ampules, and other shells for hermetic isolation from the environment of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) or irradiated fuel assemblies (IFAs); crucibles and vessels for melting, compacting, and disposing SRW; and hermetic shells or liners using composite combinations of glass ceramics and traditional materials to create special containers that provide long-term (more than 1000 years) storage or disposal of SNF. Methods for obtaining large-sized products from silicon-containing glass–ceramic materials are presented.

Preparation and doping modification of cerium oxide photosensitizers applied to photosensitive glass ceramics,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.CeO2 nanoparticles doped with different types of Pr, Y, W and CaF2 are prepared via a facile one-pot combustion method. Their crystallinity, particle size and absorption spectrum are investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), grading analysis and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) absorption spectrum. Among the doped samples, W-doped CeO2 (Ce0.9W0.1O2) is selected out, which exhibits obvious red-shift of the absorption band as compared with the undoped CeO2, achieving good match between the ceria absorption peak and the industrial 365 nm light source. Consequently, under the 365 nm exposure, the W-doped CeO2 show more efficient reduction ability for Ag+ to Ag. The results indicate that W-doped CeO2 is a very promising photosensitizer for photosensitive glass ceramics under industrial 365 nm light exposure, which can better absorb photons under UV light and then reduce Ag+ to elemental Ag.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2022.104077
Mechanoluminescence from highly transparent ZGO:Cr spinel glass ceramics,"© 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.Light emission in response to mechanical stimulation-termed mechanoluminescence (ML)-enables the optical detection and visualization of mechanical strain. In particular, materials with ML response in the transmission window of aqueous media or biological tissue enable in situ stress level monitoring, biophysical imaging or mechanically induced light delivery. However, most of today’s ML materials are polycrystalline ceramics or ceramic particle composites, which puts constraints on their bulk processability, material homogeneity and optical transparency. Here, we demonstrate ML from highly transparent glass ceramics comprising of a high-volume fraction of extraordinarily small Cr3+-doped ZnGa2O4 (ZGO) crystals embedded in a binary potassium germanate glass matrix. The ZGO phase is precipitated directly from the precursor glass by homogeneous nucleation in a narrow temperature window; entropic phase separation and a self-limited crystal growth rate yield a crystal number density above 1023 m−3. The residual glass matrix encapsulates these crystals in a dense, highly homogeneous material, whereby the microstructural stability and the extended supercooling range of the glass enable glass-like processing, for example, in the shapes of fiber, beads or microspheres.",Optical Materials Express,10.3788/LOP202259.1516008
Spectroscopic properties and crystal-field effects in Er3+-doped tellurite and phosphate glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdA series of Er3+-doped 40NaPO3–40KH2PO4-10ZnCl2-10Al2O3 (Er:NKZACl, 2Er:NKZACl) and 65TeO2-20ZnO-10BaO-3La2O3 (Er:TZBO) glasses were prepared by conventional melt quenching method, in order to compare and select the best chemical composition of glasses which exhibit opimal spectroscopic properties for broadband 1.54 µm laser emission and optical amplification. The samples were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron probe microanalysis with wavelength dispersion spectroscopy (EPMA/WDS), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and optical spectroscopy. Judd-Ofelt analysis was performed from the absorption spectra. The line strengths (Sexp and Scal) of different transitions between the 4I15/2 ground state and 11 excited states, as well as the Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters (Ω2,Ω4,Ω6) were calculated and compared to those of other glasses. Using these parameters, transition probabilities A, branching ratios β, radiative lifetimes τrad were determined. The experimental crystal-field energy sublevels of Er3+ cations were identified from the emission spectra at 77 K and the corresponding crystal-field parameters were refined for the 1Er:NKZACl and 2Er:TZBO glasses, by means of a crystal-field Hamiltonian endowed with C2 symmetry. In our study, the composition TZBO:Er3+ (2 mol%) exhibits optimal values of 4I15/2multiplet crystal-field splitting (383.7 cm−1), high Er3+ emission cross section at 1.54 µm (σem≃7.80 ×10−21 cm2), average experimental lifetime (2.97 ms) and high quantum efficiency (η≃85.6%) of the 4I13/2→4I15/2 emission. The obtained results make this glass a promising candidate for laser application and optical amplification in the infrared spectral range.",Materials Today Communications,10.1007/s40940-022-00185-x
Crystallization Behavior and Up-Conversion Luminescence of Er3+-Doped Chalcogenide Glasses Er3+掺 杂 硫 系 玻 璃 的 析 晶 行 为 及 上 转 换 发 光 研 究,"© 2022 Universitat zu Koln. All rights reserved.Rare earth doped chalcogenide glass-ceramics possess advantages for luminescence regulation because of their low phonon energy and sulfide nanocrystals. Here, 80GeS2·20Ga2S3 chalcogenide glasses and glass-ceramics doped with different mole fractions Er3+ ions were prepared and investigated via advanced structure and performance characterization. Effect of rare earth content and crystallization on the up-conversion luminescence of Er3+ ions was discussed accordingly. The results show that the introduction of Er causes the decreasing glass transition temperature and onset temperature of crystallization peak, leading to the presence of stronger diffraction peaks corresponding to Ga2S3 phase in the samples containing more Er3+ ions. The crystallization of Ga2S3 nanocrystals enhances the up-conversion by nearly 5 times, and the optimal luminescence doping mole fraction increases from 0. 75% to 1%.",Laser and Optoelectronics Progress,10.1007/s42452-022-05118-5
Determination of the linear viscoelastic material behaviour of interlayers with semi-crystalline structures shown by the example of a semi-crystalline ionomer,"© 2022, The Author(s).The temperature dependent linear viscoelastic material behaviour of the most commonly used interlayer PVB is typically determined by means of Dynamic-Mechanical-Thermal-Analysis (DMTA). By horizontally shifting the isothermal modulus curves, a mastercurve is created at a certain reference temperature, which can then be mathematically approximated with a Prony series. A time–temperature superposition principle can be derived from the shift factors. In contrast to PVB, EVA and ionomer (or ionoplastic) interlayers have semi-crystalline structures that melt when the melting temperature is reached and form again when the sample is cooled below the crystallization temperature. The exact structure and number of crystallites depend e.g. on the cooling rate and the physical age (or thermal prehistory) of the sample. These factors must be taken into account in the experimental determination of the material parameters with DMTA. Using the example of SentryGlas®, this article shows that the stiffness of semi-crystalline interlayers is affected by the crystallinity. Mastercurves from DMTA with different temperature programs are created. The degrees of crystallization for the different temperature programs are determined with Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). A time–temperature superposition principle, which applies to the purely amorphous material, and a time-crystallinity superposition principle are derived, which enable the determination of the material parameters for different temperatures and degrees of crystallization.",Glass Structures and Engineering,10.1002/pc.26875
"A practical strategy for fabrication of transparent, robust and environmentally friendly superhydrophobic surfaces for toys and games","© 2022, The Author(s).Abstract: This work presents a practical strategy for fabrication of transparent, robust and environmentally friendly superhydrophobic surfaces for toys and games by a one-step spray coating method. A type of commercial stringed silica nanoparticles (NPs) is chemically modified by a mixture of two fluorine-free silanes, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and dodecyltrimethoxysilane (DDTMS) via a sol–gel process with the aid of ammonia as a basic catalyst and a small amount of water in ethanol, resulting in the formation of an amphiphilic solution, suitable for coating a variety of substrate materials such as glass, ceramics, wood, metal, plastics and paper and so on. Polyarylic acid (PAA) is used as a binder to improve the mechanical robustness of the superhydrophobic coating. Effects of silica NPs concentration, mixing order, TEOS/DDTMS ratio, PAA amount and catalyst on the transparency, uniformity, mechanical robustness and superhydrophobicity of the resultant coatings deposited on the glass slides are investigated. The mechanisms for the superhydrophobicity and water-resistance as well as the effects of catalyst and mixing order are discussed. Furthermore, an example of the superhydrophobic surfaces as toys is presented. This work will pave the way for expanding wide applications of the superhydrophobic surfaces towards toys and games.

Additive manufacturing of bioresorbable poly(ester-urethane)/glass-ceramic composite scaffolds,"© 2022 Society of Plastics Engineers.The development of three-dimensionally printed implants for biomaterial-based tissue engineering applications is currently an active research field. In order to meet the requirements of several applications, new biocompatible and bioresorbable polymer-based materials are needed to design tailor-made polymer/composite scaffolds. In the last decade, bioresorbable segmented poly(ester-urethanes) (SPEU) have been extensively investigated for their applications in tissue engineering and many biomedical devices. In this work, 3D printed poly(ester-urethane)/bioceramic composite scaffolds were successfully fabricated by fused deposition modeling for the first time. A twin-screw extruder was used for making the SPEU composite filaments containing 5% and 10% wt/wt of glass-ceramic particles. Both filaments and scaffolds were physically and chemically studied in terms of morphology, thermal properties, wettability, and mechanical properties. The resulting composite scaffolds could be remarkably interesting for potential applications in soft tissue engineering.",Polymer Composites,10.1177/00219983221109331
Fourteen years clinical evaluation of leucite-reinforced ceramic inlays luted using two different adhesion strategies,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdObjectives: Aim of the present prospective study was to clinically evaluate the long-term performance of two different luting-materials for leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic inlays/onlays after 14 years. Methods: A total of 83 IPS-Empress-inlays/onlays were placed in 30 patients. Restorations were luted according to two different strategies: 43 restorations were fixed with a self-adhesive resin-cement (RelyXUnicem, RX), 40 restorations were inserted with VariolinkII-low (SV) after pretreatment with an etch-and-rinse multi-step adhesive. Recalls were performed after two weeks (n=83), two years (n= 82), four years (n=74) and 14 years (n=54). Two independent calibrated examiners evaluated all restorations using modified USPHS-criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using pairwise Mann-Whitney-U-test and Friedman-test (p < 0.05). Results: After 14 years, 54 restorations in 22 patients were evaluated (eight patients equalling 29 inlays not available). Ten restorations had to be replaced (failure rate 12%); four (SV-group) showed bulk fractures and two (RX-group) exhibited marginal fractures at the 14-year recall. Overall, the SV-group revealed significantly better results regarding discoloration of the luting gap (p<0.05) compared to the RX-group. No statistically significant differences were computed between SV and RX for the remaining criteria at the respective recalls (p>0.05). However, statistically significant deteriorations were detected for both luting procedures over 14 years regarding “colour match”, “marginal integrity” and “tooth integrity” (p<0.05). Conclusions: The self-adhesive resin-cement RelyXUnicem showed similar clinical performance to a conventional multi-step luting-procedure after 14 years for most of the test parameters with a slightly inferior performance of RelyXUnicem regarding discoloration of the luting gap. Clinical significance: The current study presents unique in-vivo long-term data on two adhesion-strategies for indirect ceramic single-tooth restorations. Differences in performance of the two luting methods after being challenged for 14 years in the oral environment are highlighted. However, the overarching survival rate justifies the recommendation of both methods for clinical routine.",Journal of Dentistry,10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.02.009
Improvement of mechanical and wear resistance property by varying glass fiber contents and amino-silicate coupling agents on polyamide 612 composites,"© The Author(s) 2022.Among the polyamide series polymer materials, PA612 has excellent mechanical properties and low moisture absorption characteristics. This work studied the effect of coupling agent addition on the crystallization behavior, adhesive wear, mechanical, thermal, and morphological attributes of glass fiber (GF) reinforced PA612 composites. Amino-silane was applied as a coupling agent to enhance the interfacial adhesion between glass fiber and the PA612 matrix. The loading level of the coupling agent was changed to 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0wt%, while the GF loading level in the composite material was 10, 15, 20, and 30wt%. The composite materials were analyzed via X-ray diffraction, tribological characterization, and adhesion wear test. The mechanical, rheological, and thermal properties were also investigated. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to study the analytical samples’ wear and fracture surfaces. Test results unveiled that adding 1.0wt% amino-silane coupling agent upgraded the fiber-matrix adhesion, mechanical properties (tensile strength:136 MPa), and corresponding wear resistance of GF reinforced PA612-based composites. Furthermore, it is compatible with pure PA612 substrates and has similar processing rheological behavior. These results reveal that the compiled PA612 matrix is highly viable for tribological applications comprising automotive parts, bearings, and bearing materials for space applications.

Ultrathin CAD-CAM glass-ceramic and composite resin occlusal veneers for the treatment of severe dental erosion: An up to 3-year randomized clinical trial,"© 2022 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Ultrathin bonded posterior occlusal veneers represent a conservative alternative to traditional onlays and complete coverage crowns for the treatment of erosive dental wear. Data regarding the clinical performance of ceramic and composite resin ultrathin occlusal veneers are lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this prospective randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the influence of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorative material (ceramic versus composite resin) on the clinical performance of ultrathin occlusal veneers bonded to worn posterior teeth. Material and methods: Eleven participants (mean age, 30.4 years) had their posterior teeth restored with 24 ceramic (e.max CAD) and 36 composite resin (Lava Ultimate) ultrathin occlusal veneers. The material type was assigned randomly. The tooth preparations were trial restoration driven and included immediate dentin sealing (OptiBond FL). The intaglio surfaces of the ceramic restorations were etched with hydrofluoric acid and silanated, and the composite resins were airborne-particle abraded and silanated. The tooth preparations were airborne-particle abraded and etched with phosphoric acid before restoration insertion. All restorations were adhesively luted with preheated composite resin (Filtek Z100). The participants were evaluated according to the modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria at baseline and then each year for up to 3 years. Survival rates were estimated with time to failure (primary outcome of interest) as the endpoint (scores 4 or 5). Results: No restorations were lost. Five partial failures, in the form of chipping (all scored 4), were observed in the composite resin group (Lava Ultimate). The Kaplan-Meier survival rates were 100% for ceramic and 84.7% (SE 0.065%) for composite resin. Differences between the 2 groups were not statistically significant (P=.124). In the surviving restorations, significant difference (P=.003) was found for surface roughness as restorations in the composite resin group experienced some surface degradation. Conclusions: The findings of this medium-term clinical trial suggest that ceramic (e.max CAD) and composite resin (Lava Ultimate) CAD-CAM ultrathin occlusal veneers presented statistically comparable performance regardless of the minor partial failures (restorable chipping) observed in the composite resin group. Higher surface degradation was observed in the composite resin group.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1016/j.matdes.2022.110860
CAD/CAM versus 3D-printing/pressed lithium disilicate monolithic crowns: Adaptation and fatigue behavior,"© 2022Objectives: this study aimed to evaluate the adaptation and fatigue behavior of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (LD) monolithic crowns produced by press (combined with 3D-printing) and CAD/CAM milling (control) techniques. Methods: thirty abutment preparations with a chamfer finish line were produced with a dentin analogue material and scanned with extraoral scanner. Captured images were processed using CAD software to design a premolar. Blocks of LD were milled using CAD/CAM system. For the press technique, crowns were first 3D-printed using a polymeric material and the heat-pressing protocol was performed. Crowns were adhesively cemented to the abutments and scanned using micro-CT. Files were processed and cross-sectional images were analysed in five measuring points: marginal, axial angle, axial, occlusal angle and occlusal. Fatigue test was performed in a MTS universal testing machine (2 Hz, 37°C distilled water) using an anatomic composite piston, following the step-stress method. Failures were detected with an acoustic system and confirmed by transillumination. A cumulative damage-Weibull distribution (95% CI) was used to analyze the fatigue data. Gap thickness data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Student-Newman-Keuls tests (α=0.05). Results: CAD/CAM milling resulted in larger gap thickness in the occlusal area and smaller gap thickness in the axial angle and axial area than press (p<0.05). The probability of failure was similar for crowns produced with CAD/CAM milling and press. The most frequent failure mode was radial crack. Conclusions: LD crowns produced using the combination of 3D-printing/press technique showed similar fatigue behavior than CAD/CAM milled control group, and resulted in smaller gap thickness at the occlusal region. Clinical significance: A more controlled process can be achieved by replacing conventional restoration waxing with 3D printing, which in combination with the press technique produces lithium disilicate glass-ceramic monolithic crowns with good adaptation and high fatigue survival.",Journal of Dentistry,10.1016/j.omx.2022.100164
Stabilized anode-electrolyte interfaces via Cs4Pb(Cl/Br/I)6 perovskite crystal based glass-ceramics for fast and long cycle-life lithium ion batteries,"© 2022Alternative choices of anode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) have drawn great attention to the urgent demands of rapid charging, however, the severe interface problems remain a bottleneck for the anode development. Based on the high reducibility of halogen elements, herein a smart anode/liquid electrolyte interface is designed for the high energy density batteries that present large specific capacity retentions of about 510.5 mAh∙g−1 (Cl-matrix) and 429.6 mAh∙g−1 (Br-matrix) at the current density of 5 A∙g−1 after cycling 1000 times. As a novel anode material, the low-dimension halide perovskite microcrystals Cs4Pb(Cl/Br/I)6 embedded in the glass matrix present high ionic conductivities (10−5 ∼ 10−4 S∙cm−1) that enables fast charge transfer, besides the smooth interface benefits ionic transport reversibly.

Transparent Er3+ doped Ag2O containing tellurite glass-ceramics,"© 2022 The Author(s)Transparent Er3+ doped Ag2O containing tellurite glass-ceramics were fabricated by melting process followed by a heat treatment at 20 °C above the glass transition temperature of the glass for 2 to 17 h. The effects of the crystallization on the optical and luminescence properties of the glasses are presented and discussed. The precipitation of Bi4TeO8 crystal was conﬁrmed in all the glasses, independently of their composition. From the spectroscopic properties, the heat treatment was found to have no impact on the site of the Er3+ ions indicating that the Er3+ ions remain in the amorphous part of the glass-ceramic. Although Ag nanoparticles could be evidenced using transmission electron microscopy and nonlinear optical imaging, no surface plasmon resonance band of Ag nanoparticles appeared in the absorption spectrum of the heat treated glasses. No enhancement of the NIR emission centered at 1.5 μm was observed probably due to the low concentration of Ag nanoparticles precipitating in the glasses. However, an increase in the intensity of the upconversion and mid-infrared emissions was observed from the glass-ceramics prepared with the low amount of Ag2O (<1 mol%). As evidenced using Raman spectroscopy, the addition of Ag2O was found to depolymerize the tellurite network. The precipitation of the Bi4TeO8 crystal in the most polymerized glasses is suspected to reduce the Er–Er distances whereas it has no significant impact on the Er–Er distances in glasses with a depolymerized network.",Optical Materials: X,10.1016/j.actbio.2022.06.009

While additively manufactured porous iron has been somewhat successful in addressing the first challenge, the limited bioactivity of these biomaterials hinder their progress towards clinical application. Herein, we used extrusion-based 3D printing for additive manufacturing of iron-matrix composites containing silicate-based bioceramic particles (akermanite), thereby addressing both of the abovementioned challenges. We developed inks that carried iron and 5, 10, 15, or 20 vol% of akermanite powder mixtures for the 3D printing process and optimized the debinding and sintering steps to produce geometrically-ordered iron-akermanite composites with an open porosity of 69–71%. The composite scaffolds preserved the designed geometry and the original α-Fe and akermanite phases. The in vitro biodegradation rates of the composites were improved as much as 2.6 times the biodegradation rate of geometrically identical pure iron. The yield strengths and elastic moduli of the scaffolds remained within the range of the mechanical properties of the cancellous bone, even after 28 days of biodegradation. The composite scaffolds (10–20 vol% akermanite) demonstrated improved MC3T3-E1 cell adhesion and higher levels of cell proliferation. The cellular secretion of collagen type-1 and the alkaline phosphatase activity on the composite scaffolds (10–20 vol% akermanite) were, respectively higher than and comparable to Ti6Al4V in osteogenic medium. Taken together, these results clearly show the potential of 3D printed porous iron-akermanite composites for further development as promising bone substitutes. Statement of significance: Porous iron matrix composites containing akermanite particles were produced by means of multi-material additive manufacturing to address the two fundamental challenges associated with biodegradable iron-based biomaterials, namely very low rate of biodegradation and insufficient bioactivity. Our porous iron-akermanite composites exhibited enhanced biodegradability and superior bioactivity compared to porous monolithic iron scaffolds. The murine bone cells proliferated on the composite scaffolds, and secreted the collagen type-1 matrix that stimulated bony-like mineralization. The results show the exceptional potential of the developed porous iron-based composite scaffolds for application as bone substitutes.",Acta Biomaterialia,10.1007/s10008-022-05210-1
Sol-gel-derived transparent glass-ceramics for photonics,"© 2022Photonic glass-ceramics are two-phase materials constituted by nanometer sized crystals, passive or activated by luminescent species, embedded in a glass matrix. Among the different techniques used to fabricate transparent glass ceramics the sol-gel route is highly appreciated because it allows to explore different compositions and develop novel functionalities. By engineering glass-ceramics chemistry, nature, or volume fractions of crystalline and amorphous phases, several interesting properties can be achieved and tailored so that the sol-gel technique appears one of the most versatile processes for the fabrication of photonic systems. The aim of the present paper is to give a brief state of the art and some significant examples of systems developed, even in our research network, during the last ten years of activity, in order to highlights the reliability and versatility of sol-gel -derived glass-ceramics for photonics application. With this aim, the main topics discussed here deal with: (i) transparent rare-earth-activated SiO2–SnO2 glass-ceramics; (ii) mechanical properties of glass ceramics coatings.",Optical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105296
Development of high ionic-conductive Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic solid electrolyte sheet at low temperature using glass/powder composite,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Because of some drawbacks of the organic electrolytes, such as high toxicity and flammability, inorganic electrolytes have attracted attention regarding applications in all-solid-state rechargeable batteries. However, the fabrication of such electrolytes generally requires high sintering temperatures. To address this issue, in this study, ceramic sheets of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP)-based solid electrolyte were prepared using glass, powder, and a glass/powder composite. The use of LAGP and glass-ceramic enabled the prepared sheets to be sintered at a low temperature of 750 °C. The obtained LAGP-based solid electrolytes had the trigonal structure of sodium superionic conductor (NASICON). The LAGP glass/powder composite ceramic sheet (GPCS) exhibited fewer pores and a higher density than the glass-only and powder-only sheets. Owing to its high crystallinity and density, the LAGP_GPCS exhibited total ionic conductivity of 4.52 × 10−4 S/cm, which is exceedingly high compared with that of the other two sheets. This finding confirms that the ionic conductivity of LAGP can be increased by using simple composites. Thus, LAGP_GPCS can improve the efficiency of electric vehicles and smart grid energy storage systems, which rely on high-performance all-solid-state rechargeable batteries.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry,10.1177/00219983221084408
Mechanical properties and machinability of lithium silicate glass-ceramics with varying MgO content,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThis study focused on the role of lithium metasilicate crystalline phase and microstructural evolution on altering the mechanical properties and machinability of two glass-ceramic system, (Li2O–K2O–Na2O–CaO–MgO–ZrO2–Al2O3–P2O5–SiO2), previously developed by our research group. Our previous study showed that increasing MgO content introduced phase separation and thus controlling the crystallization and microstructure of the glass-ceramics. For this study we chose the glass ceramic system with 1.5 and 4.5 mol% MgO. The glass-ceramics were prepared by melt cast method followed by heat treatment at 650 °C to induce partial crystallization. The crystalline phase in the glass-ceramics was identified by x-ray diffraction and the quantification of crystalline and amorphous phase content was done using Rietveld refinement. The hardness and elastic moduli were measured by nanoindentation. Vickers hardness and fracture toughness were determined by micro indentation. Nano scratch test was performed and scratch morphology was characterized using AFM and FEG-SEM. In order to compare the machinability of the prepared glass-ceramic samples, milling experiments were carried out using CNC milling machine, and machining characteristics were compared by analysing machining force, surface roughness and microstructure of the machined surface. Presence of higher amount of lithium metasilicate (LS) crystals in higher magnesia containing glass-ceramic (G2) resulted in lower average force (Fyrms) as compared to lower MgO containing glass-ceramic. However, due to a wide range of variation in crystal size (150 nm - 2 μm) in higher MgO containing glass-ceramic, the force fluctuation was more than lower MgO containing glass-ceramics.",Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2022.126286
Propagation of tunnelling cracks in composite materials under strain and force-controlled cyclic loading,"© The Author(s) 2022.In this paper, the propagation of tunnelling cracks in composite laminates subjected to uniaxial force-controlled and strain-controlled cyclic loading is analysed considering both interacting and non-interacting cracking scenarios. Glass fibre reinforced polymer laminates with (Formula presented.) layup are used in the analysis. For non-interacting cracks, a strain-controlled test under a single strain value is found to be sufficient to produce the slope of the Paris-Erdogan law type curve relating the crack front growth rate (CGR) with the energy release rate (ERR), but within a limited range of ERR. Whereas, a force-controlled test is found more suitable when characterising the variation of the CGR at a certain ERR value. For closely spaced cracks, commonly seen crack interaction scenarios are identified and the CGR of the crack front is investigated for both loading control modes. It is found that the CGR decreases when volume averaged stresses are reduced ahead of the crack front due to shielding effect at high crack densities. A relationship between these two parameters is presented. It is further found that the CGR of two collinear crack fronts growing towards each other for coalescence do not influence each other. But when the two crack fronts are not collinear the CGR of the crack fronts is significantly affected after they have grown past each other.",Journal of Composite Materials,10.1016/j.engfailanal.2022.106341
Shear-thinning sacrificial ink for fabrication of Biosilicate® osteoconductive scaffolds by material extrusion 3D printing,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Osteoconductive scaffolds are required to stimulate and enhance the regenerative potential of cells in bone tissue engineering applications. Additive manufacturing (AM), popularly known as 3D printing, has been widely used to fabricate these porous structures. In this study, bioceramic scaffolds based on highly bioactive glass-ceramic (Biosilicate®) were developed and characterized using a hydrogel as sacrificial ink for material extrusion 3D printing. A paste containing Biosilicate as solid filler was developed from a sacrificial ink whose formulation is based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-400) with 7.5% (w/w) Laponite® nanoclay as rheological modifier. Initially, the rheological behaviors of the sacrificial ink (PL) and of the ceramic paste with 70% (v/v) Biosilicate (PL-BioS) were evaluated. Viscosity of the PL increased with addition of Biosilicate, showing a shear-thinning behavior appropriate to material extrusion 3D printing. After that, samples were 3D printed and dried at 20 and 50 °C. The dimensional characteristics of the samples were evaluated and compared, and showed that drying at 20 °C resulted in lower degree of shrinkage and mass loss before sintering. Preliminary heating stage microscopy tests were performed to define the sintering parameters, and then the scaffolds were sintered at 900 °C for 5 h at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. The sintered scaffolds were analyzed by FTIR, XRD, and SEM. These characterizations showed that the PL was eliminated from the structure with no significant change in scaffold composition, which remained intact after this process, and that the residual Laponite improved scaffold strength with formation of micropores internally to the filaments. An in vitro biological study confirmed the nontoxic behavior of the developed scaffolds on NHI-3T3 fibroblast-like cells, showing suitable cell adhesion, growth and proliferation on their surface, which are associated with good osteoconductive properties. In conclusion, the use of PL gels combined with Biosilicate is promising for ceramic ink formulation, considering that shear-thinning materials facilitate the 3D printing process. Moreover, preliminary mechanical and biological results reveal the potential of the sintered scaffolds for use in bone tissue engineering.",Materials Chemistry and Physics,10.1007/s10971-022-05855-4
Change in elastic modulus during fatigue bending and torsion of a polymer reinforced with continuous glass fibers,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe paper emphasizes the fact that in the case of composite materials which are characterized by anisotropy, unlike classic isotropic materials, the modulus of elasticity changes its value when the degree of damage changes. Moreover, a decrease in this modulus can characterize the degree of material damage. The literature on this phenomenon was analyzed. However, the vast majority of studies leading to the description of changes in the stiffness of the material have so far been carried out only for uniaxial tension–compression. One case was also found where the authors performed a similar analysis for the material subjected to torsion. It was found that such analysis has not yet been performed for pendulum bending, which is a very common type of load in structural elements. Based on the authors’ own experimental research for cyclic pendulum bending and double-sided torsion of specimens made of polyamide PA6, reinforced with continuous glass fibers, it was found that, as in the case of uniaxial tension–compression, as the degree of damage increases, there is also a decrease in both Young's modulus for bending and the shear modulus for torsion.",Engineering Failure Analysis,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105278

Simulation of CAD/CAM milling on lithium disilicate: Mechanical and topographic analyses of surface grinding different protocols,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe aim of this study was to evaluate the topography and the fatigue performance of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic after surface grinding through different laboratory protocols used to simulate the Computer-aided design/Computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) milling. Ceramic discs (IPS e.max CAD, Ø = 13.5 mm × 1.2 mm of thickness) were produced through different methodologies: milling in CAD/CAM system (CAD/CAM group); produced in-lab with a polished surface (POL group); or produced through in-lab methods and randomly distributed into five groups according to different grinding protocols to simulate the CAD/CAM milling [grinding with a CAD/CAM bur coupled to a mandrel (CAD/CAM Bur group); fine diamond bur using oscillatory movements (DBO group); fine diamond bur in x and y axes of the disc (DBXY group); #60-grit silicon carbide sandpaper (SiC group); and #60-grit wood sandpaper (WS group)]. The specimens were fatigue tested (n = 15) according to the step-stress method (initial load: 60 N; step-size: 20 N; 10,000 cycles/step; 20 Hz frequency). A roughness analysis was performed on all specimens, while fractal dimension (FD) and fractography were performed on representative samples. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the POL (293.3 N) group presented better fatigue performance (higher load and number of cycles for failure) (p < 0.05) than the other groups (CAD/CAM = 222.7 N; CAD/CAM Bur = 181.3 N; DBO = 184.0 N; DBXY = 192.0 N; SiC = 182.6 N; WS = 182.6 N). For roughness, only the SiC (Ra = 1.616; Rz = 10.465) and WS (Ra = 1.673; Rz = 10.655) groups produced statistically similar Ra (μm) and Rz (μm) values to the CAD/CAM (Ra = 1.628; Rz = 9.571) group (p > 0.05). The surface created by CAD/CAM milling and POL group exhibited more complexity (FD) higher values than the experimental groups. For the ceramic surface topography images, the CAD/CAM milling visibly produced a uniform surface compared to the other groups; however, the POL group was the smoothest. The DBO, DBXY, SiC, and WS groups resulted in similar characteristics of surface topography. Therefore, although the SiC and WS groups showed similar roughness to the control group (CAD/CAM), no in-lab simulation method was fully capable to mimic the mechanical performance of the CAD/CAM-milled lithium disilicate glass-ceramic.",Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1515/polyeng-2022-0033
Non-ordinary state-based peridynamic fatigue modelling of composite laminates with arbitrary fibre orientation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdFor the safe application of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials in engineering structures, fatigue life prediction and failure modelling are essential. In this paper, an application of a nonordinary state-based peridynamics (NOSB-PD) approach for the fatigue failure prediction of multilayer CFRP was presented. To characterize the structure of composite laminates, matrix and fibre bonds were introduced within the plies, and normal and shear bonds were introduced between the plies. The fatigue simulation model of composite materials was established by combining the fatigue theory of peridynamics and Paris-Erdogan law, and a method to obtain model parameters was proposed. To demonstrate the accuracy of the model, tension and fatigue experiments were conducted. By comparing the results of tensile and fatigue experiments, it was shown that the model developed in this paper can accurately predict the failure process of multidirectional CFRP laminate under the action of tensile or fatigue loading. The crack initiation and propagation for different laminae during the tensile and fatigue processes can be obtained from the proposed model.",Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics,10.1007/s11581-022-04614-3
Advancement in hemp fibre polymer composites: A comprehensive review,"© 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.Natural fibres as reinforcement for composite materials have witnessed a resurgence of interest in the past few years, largely due to ecological concerns, legislative directives and technological advancements. Hemp is one of the most popular natural fibres used as reinforcement in polymers owing to its superior mechanical properties. At present, hemp fibres have attracted the global interest of design engineers for developing composites having extensive applications in automobiles, electrical, construction and packaging industries. Although several literatures explore different aspects of hemp fibre reinforced composites, there is no proper literature that summarizes the surface treatment, processing techniques, mechanical performance and hybridization of hemp fibre composites. This review is envisioned to put forth a comprehensive summary of the research work published in the field of hemp fibre reinforced composites with special reference to the structure of hemp fibres, different methods for surface modification and processing techniques to fabricate the composites based on thermoplastic, thermoset and biopolymers.

Solid electrolyte based on 2-adamantanone for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s).Solid-state batteries are considered the next step in battery technology. Materials investigated for application as solid-state electrolytes are mainly oxide ceramics, sulfidic (glass-) ceramics, and polymers. Besides these, another class of solid electrolytes with promising properties is based on plastic crystals. Especially due to their waxy behavior, they promise good interfaces within a solid-state battery. In this work, a new plastic crystal, 2-adamantanone, is investigated as basis for a solid electrolyte for the first time. Its large temperature window from − 95 to 255 °C for its plastic (conductive) state and the high dipole moment of 3.4 D make it a promising material for battery application. The mixture with a lithium salt was investigated thermally with TGA and DSC revealing stability in a large temperature range from − 30 to + 80 °C. IR investigations show the dissociation of the conductive salt, which is necessary for the lithium ion conduction. The ionic conductivity of the electrolytes reaches values up to 1.4·10−4 S/cm at room temperature with a very low activation energy of only 0.32 eV.",Ionics,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.132358
"Study of graphene oxide complexed hemicucurbit[6]uril on polypropylene composites: Crystallization behavior, foaming performance, and mechanical properties","© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.In this study, hemicucurbit[6]uril (HQ6) complexed with graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized through solution method. HQ6@GO was assessed by Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy, thermal, and X-ray powder diffraction analysis. Results showed that HQ6 and GO bound together by noncovalent bond force. Polypropylene (PP) foaming material was processed through injection molding with azodicarbonamide as the foaming agent and HQ6@GO as the nucleating agent. The effect of HQ6@GO on the properties of the PP composite material, such as crystallization was assessed. Result showed that HQ6@GO can increase the crystallization rate, and the crystallinity was increased from 37.26% for pure PP to 43.24% for PP/HQ6@GO composites. HQ6@GO showed the best foaming nucleation effect, with 1.0 wt% addition of HQ6@GO, the average cell size decreased by about three times, and the cell density was increased by about 10 times compared with pure PP.

Effect of ZrO2 on crystallization behavior and mechanical property of Dy2O3–Al2O3–SiO2 glasses,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Effects of ZrO2 content on the crystallization kinetics, formation mechanism of voids and mechanical property of Dy2O3–Al2O3–SiO2 glass were studied. The crystallization method of DAS glasses transforms from surface crystallization into bulk crystallization with an increase in ZrO2 content from 0-3% to 6–9%. When ZrO2 content is 0–3%, the crystalline phases of DAS glass ceramics are Dy2Si2O7 and Al2O3, accompanied by formation of voids. When ZrO2 content is 6–9%, the DAS glass ceramics consist of Dy2Si2O7, Al2O3 and ZrO2. At the same time, no voids are found in the glass ceramics. Therefore, formation of voids during crystallization can be attributed to combined effect of the crystallization method and the density difference before and after crystallization. In addition, for glassy samples, the flexural strength increases from 80.4 MPa to 219.3 MPa with an increase in ZrO2 content from 0% to 9%. Moreover, crystallization further improves the mechanical properties of the DAS glass ceramics with bulk crystallization method.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.045
"Zinc Phosphate Nanoparticles: A Review on Physical, Chemical, and Biological Synthesis and their Applications","© 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.Nanotechnology is considered one of the emerging fields of science that has influenced diverse applications, including food, biomedicine, and cosmetics. The production and usage of materials with nanoscale dimensions like nanoparticles are attractive parts of nanotechnology. Among different nanoparticles, zinc phosphate nanoparticles have attracted attention due to their biocompatibility, bi-osafety, non-toxicity, and environmental compatibility. These nanoparticles could be employed in various applications like anticorrosion, antibacterial, dental cement, glass ceramics, tissue engineering, and drug delivery. A variety of physical, chemical, and green synthesis methods have been used to synthe-size zinc phosphate nanoparticles. All these methods have some limitations along with certain ad-vantages. Chemical approaches may cause health risks and environmental problems due to the toxicity of hazardous chemicals used in these techniques. Moreover, physical methods require high amounts of energy as well as expensive instruments. However, biological methods are free of chemical contami-nants and eco-friendly.

Effect of ZnO on the crystallization behavior and properties of SiO2–CaO–Al2O3–Fe2O3 glass-ceramics prepared from simulated secondary slag after reduction of copper slag,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The feasibility of preparing low-cost glass-ceramics from Zn-containing dust and secondary molten slag generated during the carbothermal reduction of copper slag was investigated. Analytical-grade agents, such as ZnO, Fe2O3, SiO2, CaO, and Al2O3, were used to simulate the dust and secondary slag. The effect of ZnO content on the crystallization behavior, structure, and mechanical properties of the glass-ceramics was investigated through X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that with increased ZnO content from 0 to 6 wt%, the crystallization activation energy of base glass increased from 386.05 to 425.89 kJ/mol. Meanwhile, the average value of the crystal growth index increased from 1.91 to 4.10, and the highest crystallization rate of the glass-ceramics increased from about 1.44 to 23.11 mm3/min. The increased ZnO in glass-ceramics promoted the precipitation of gehlenite, but inhibit the crystallization of anorthite. When the ZnO content was 6 wt%, the comprehensive properties of the glass-ceramics were better; the flexural strength, microhardness, volume density, water absorption rate, and open porosity were 58.67 MPa, 738.35 HV, 2.92 g/cm3, 0.44% and 1.27%, respectively.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121659
Preparation and photocatalytic properties of dual-crystalline glass-ceramics containing NASICON-type KTi2(PO4)3 and anatase-type TiO2,"© 2022The K2O-ZnO-TiO2-P2O5 system glasses with different components were successfully prepared by the conventional melt-quenching method. According to the results of DSC, two-step heat treatment was carried out, and NASICON-type KTi2(PO4)3 were precipitated in the glass matrix as the main crystal phase. In addition, anatase-type TiO2 crystals were also detected in some glass ceramics. The surface grain morphology of the glass-ceramics was observed by SEM, and the optical band gap was estimated by UV–vis DRS. Under the irradiation of a high-pressure mercury lamp, the photodegradation ability of the glass-ceramics to methylene blue (MB) solution was investigated. KTi2(PO4)3 and anatase phases were the reasons for the photocatalytic activity of the glass-ceramics, and the MB degradation rate can reach 55–79% after illumination for 120 min. At the same time, the glass-ceramics were separated from the solution by settling for 15 min. The results show that prepared glass-ceramics have excellent UV photocatalytic performance and can be easily separated from the aqueous medium, which has potential application in the purification of organic dye wastewater.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121644
Influence of V2O5 concentration on structural and electrical transport properties of semiconducting ternary glass and glass-ceramics nanocomposite system,"© 2022The effects of V2O5 concentration on semiconducting xV2O5–(1-x) (0.25Nd2O3–0.75ZnO) glass nanocomposites were investigated by structural, optical, and electrical conductivity studies. The composition dependency of physical attributes like density, molar volume, bond dissociation energy, number of bonds per unit volume, etc., was established. Using X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy, we identified the presence of different nanocrystallites and amorphousness. DC electrical conductivity was caused by the small polaron hopping due to the presence of V4+ and V5+ valence states, enhanced as the small polaron radius was reduced with rising V2O5 concentration. The non-overlapping small polaron tunnelling (NSPT) model was the preferred AC conduction process, and reducing nature of tunnelling distance enhanced AC conductivity with increasing V2O5 concentration. We modified the existing NSPT model to get reasonable values for fitting parameters. The scaled AC conductivity spectra revealed temperature independence and the composition-dependent conductivity relaxation process of small polarons.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.172
Ca9Al(PO4)7 based sintered glass-ceramic for high dielectric breakdown strength,"© 2022A novel Ca9Al(PO4)7 (CAP) based sintered glass-ceramic has been synthesized via the glass melting process and temperature controlled crystallization. The mechanisms of high dielectric breakdown strength (DBS) of the glass-ceramic were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy, crystal structure and high temperature complex impedance spectroscopy. CAP has a crystal structure similar to β-Ca3(PO4)2 (β-TCP) and a higher band gap (Egap), which makes it difficult for valence electrons to break away from binding and become free charges. At the same time, the isolated vacancy formed by Al replacing Ca becomes a capture site to prevent the transmission of free charge. Furthermore, CAP based glass-ceramic have a high activation energy of grain and grain boundary, which impedes the movement of free charges. All these endow this CAP based sintered glass-ceramic with a high DBS of 110.5 ± 5.3 kV/mm.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1111/jace.18505
Improving the machinability of fluorophlogopite glass-ceramic by spark plasma sintering,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Machinable glass-ceramic has found extensive applications in dentistry, aerospace, and vacuum industries. In the present study, glasses were first prepared in the SiO2–Al2O3–MgO–F system. Glass-ceramics with mica-based crystals were then prepared by heat treatment nucleation and growth. To eliminate the interfering phases and improve the machinability, the glass-ceramic was crushed by mechanical milling, followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS) at 750 °C and a pressure of 30 MPa. The microstructure of the samples was also explored by SEM. The major phase in the initial glass-ceramic was fluorophlogopite. Regarding uniaxial pressure in the SPS process, signs of the preferred crystal orientation were found in the images of SPS samples. The hardness of the SPS sample was 553 H V which was lower than that of the initial glass-ceramic (811 HV). Machinability was improved due to the increase in the content of the mica phase and its preferred orientation.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.122
Intense continuous-wave laser and mode-locked pulse operation from Yb3+-doped oxyfluoride glass–ceramic fibers,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.Ultrafast fiber lasers, due to their short pulse duration, excellent beam quality, and high brightness, are extensively used in precision processing, biomedicine, nonlinear optics, and spectroscopy. However, great challenges still exist in improving the optical conversion efficiency in glass-based gain media because of the high non-radiative transition probability. Here, we demonstrate an oxyfluoride glass–ceramic (GC) fiber containing NaYF4:Yb3+ nanocrystal that enables enhanced 1064-nm continuous-wave laser output with an optical signal-to-noise ratio of 60 dB. Compared with the as-prepared glass fiber, the optical conversion efficiency of GC fiber is improved from 24.2% to 30.0%. The improvement of laser action is mainly caused by the preferential incorporation of Yb3+ into the NaYF4 nanocrystal with low phonon energy. Using this well-developed GC fiber, we successfully built a passively mode-locked pulsed fiber laser that deliveries laser pulses with a pulse duration of 8.1 ps and a repetition frequency of 56.92 MHz. These results highlight that the GC strategy may provide a roadmap for the development of ultrafast fiber laser and the application of GC fibers in various optoelectronic fields.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.138
Joining of alumina using magnesium- or calcium-aluminosilicate glass–ceramic fillers,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Magnesium- and calcium-aluminosilicate (MAS and CAS) glass–ceramics were used to join alumina with six different compositions. The fillers were applied onto the alumina by screen-printing, and then joining was performed slightly below and above the filler melting temperature (Tm). The evolution of various intermediate compounds upon heat treatment between the filler itself and at the joining interface was compared. MgAl2O4 and CaO·6Al2O3 was the main crystalline phase presented at the joining interface for the MAS and CAS system, respectively, while more intermediate compounds were observed when only filler was heat-treated. The formation of MgAl2O4 and CaO·6Al2O3 was attributed to the diffusion of Al ions from the alumina base, which is desirable for obtaining a sound joint due to the similar coefficient of thermal expansion to the base alumina. The maximum joint strength of 250 ± 41 and 301 ± 48 MPa was obtained for MAS and CAS filler system, respectively, after joining at T ≥ Tm due to complete interfacial wetting.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.112
"Preparation and characterization of fully waste-based glass-ceramics from incineration fly ash, waste glass and coal fly ash","© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash (FA) is a typical hazardous waste due to its high contents of toxic heavy metals, and hence its disposal has attracted global concern. In this work, it was recycled into environmental-friendly CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 system glass-ceramics via adding coal fly ash (CFA) and waste glass (WG). The effects of CaO/SiO2 ratios and sintering temperatures on the crystalline phases, morphologies, mechanical and chemical properties, heavy metals leaching and potential ecological risks of glass-ceramics were investigated. The results showed that wollastonite (CaSiO3), anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) and gehlenite (Ca2Al2SiO7) were the dominant crystals in the glass-ceramics, which were not affected by CaO/SiO2 ratio and sintering temperature. The compressive strength increased, while the Vickers hardness and microhardness decreased as increasing the sintering temperatures from 850 to 1050 °C, which reached their maximum values of 660.69 MPa, 6.14 GPa, and 7.43 GPa, respectively. However, the increase of CaO/SiO2 ratio resulted into the reduction of the three mechanical parameters. As varying CaO/SiO2 ratio from 0.48 to 0.86, the maximum compressive strength, Vickers hardness and microhardness were 611.80 MPa, 5.43 GPa, and 6.56 GPa, respectively. Besides, all the glass-ceramics exhibited high alkali resistance of >97%. The extremely low heavy metals leaching concentrations and low potential ecological risk of glass-ceramics further revealed its environmentally friendly property and potential application feasibility.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.147
"Structure and emission properties of P2O5–Na2O–Pb3O4-MO, (MO = SrO, Y2O3, MoO3, Ag2O, CdO and SnO) glass and glass ceramics","© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.A group of glass and glass ceramic solids with compositions of 70%P2O5–20%Na2O–9%Pb3O4–1%MO, where MO refers to SrO, Y2O3, MoO3, Ag2O, CdO and SnO were prepared by rapid quenching from molten state. The random environment of all obtained samples was verified by X-ray diffraction. Several phosphate groups and bands in addition to the presence of P–O-M and M-O-M linkages are evidenced by IR spectroscopy. The density and molar volume values of the studied samples were found to depend on the relative constituent dopant molecules and the experimental values are found to exhibit approximately the same behavior as the theoretically obtained values. The characteristic temperatures are also studied by the DTA analysis, where the thermal constancy of the samples is showed to grow up with moving rightward in the periodic table from Sr to Sn ion. All the samples are found to be of the diamagnetic type, with a major magnetic effect played by the Na+ ions. The studied samples are found to emit light with different colors when excited by a light with 365 nm wavelength. The obtained CCT, CRI and LER values nominates the present glasses to be involved in manufacturing solid state light sources for high cool light applications.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.101
Nd3+-doped glass-ceramic fiber fabricated by drawing precursor ceramic and successive heat treatment,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Optical fibers have been formed by replacing precursor glass core with precursor ceramic core, in which drawing process, the precursor ceramic melted to fill the space of the core region while the clad glass was softened. Nd3+ doped LaNbO4 nanocrystals were precipitated in the core after heat treatment. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, optical microscope, and photoluminescence were used to characterize the obtained fiber. No crystallization, cracking, bubble, or undissolved substance is observed in the core region of precursor fiber. Nd3+ doped LaNbO4 nanocrystals are precipitated in the core region after thermal treatment.

Effect of substitution of ZrO2 by SnO2 on crystallization and properties of environment-friendly Li2O–Al2O3–SiO2 system (LAS) glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.In this study, a transparent and environmentally friendly Li2O–Al2O3–SiO2 (LAS) glass-ceramic was prepared by melt-quenching and two-step heat treatment. The influence of the substitution amount of ZrO2 by SnO2 on the crystallization, microstructure, transparency, and mechanical properties of LAS glass and glass-ceramics was investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Ultraviolet–visible Spectrophotometer, three-point bending strength test, and microhardness test. The results indicate that the main crystalline phase of LAS glass ceramics was a β-quartz solid solution when heat treated at 780 °C for 2 h and 870 °C for 1.5 h. When the substitution amount of ZrO2–SnO2 increased from 0.4 mol% to 2.5 mol%, the grain size and thermal expansion coefficient of LAS glass-ceramics first decreased and then increased, and the crystallinity first increased and then decreased. When the substitution amount of ZrO2–SnO2 was 0.8 mol%, the transparency of the LAS glass-ceramics was maximum, the bending strength was 96 MPa, and the Vickers hardness was 10.9 GPa.",Ceramics International,10.1007/s40032-022-00811-1
Heat up impact on thermal stresses in SOFC for mobile APU applications: Thermo-structural analysis,"© 2022 The Author(s)Because of its high efficiency, fuel flexibility, and high-quality waste heat for cogeneration requirements, the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a potential fuel cell type for power generation in a variety of applications. High working temperatures provide these benefits, but they also come with drawbacks, such as restrictions on the operating environment, problems with thermal management, long on/off times, and the issue of selecting appropriate materials to assure compatibility of the physical material properties of the fuel cell stack components. However, the elevated process temperatures of the SOFC system result in technical challenges. The heat-up stage is a critical issue for the SOFC stack, since the transient process conditions lead to thermal gradients which are combined with material gradients. The result is a mismatch in the thermal–mechanical material behavior inducing high thermal stresses, which in turn affect the functionality of the fuel cell stack. In the SOFC stack under consideration, a glass ceramic joint is used to ensure reliable sealing between cells. This region is identified to be at risk, due to high thermal stresses. In this study the computational modeling approach is applied to predict the thermal-structural response of the stack components to different heat-up strategies and investigate the system with respect to fuel cell temperature, thermal gradients, and induced stresses. Computational thermal and structural results for time dependent heat-up speeds are presented and compared. Essentially, running the process with a constant speed would not provide an optimized solution. Instead, the obtained results show that the heat-up speed should be adjusted to achieve the desired state of fuel cell temperature, reduced thermal gradients and stresses. This target can be met by applying mathematical modeling approach, since experimental analysis are time and cost consuming.",Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.03.023
Classification of Damages in Composite Material using Multi-support Vector Machine,"© 2022, The Institution of Engineers (India).The mechanical properties of composite-reinforced natural fibres depend on parameters like fibre strength, length and chemical behaviour of fibre–matrix interfacial bond. The clarification of the research and development of composite-reinforced natural fibres improve the mechanical properties along with end applications. In this paper, multi-support vector machine (MSVM) is used to test the durability of composite material and the classification of damages in composite material. The images are collected across a composite material with 5–7 mm impingement. The images are filtered initially using an anisotropic filter. The classification is finally estimated out with MSVM classifier. Experimental validation is conducted over various composite materials, and the results are tested in real-time images. The validation shows that the proposed method attains the improved rate of accuracy in classifying the images than other existing state-of-the art models. Further, the durability of the material is tested in terms of material removal rate, wear resistance rate and material strength.",Journal of The Institution of Engineers (India): Series C,10.1002/adem.202101550
High frequency impedance measurements of sodium solid electrolytes,"© 2022Solid-state sodium batteries are currently gaining enormous interest as a lower-cost and more environmentally friendly alternative to lithium batteries. They contain significantly less critical rare elements in both the electrolyte and the active material. However, to date, there is no efficient material combination of metallic anode, cathode, and solid electrolyte for room temperature applications that does not require an additional liquid electrolyte while maintaining high energy density. NaPSiO-based glass-ceramics show high ionic conductivity at room temperature, good corrosion resistance against ambient humidity and CO2, and stability against metallic sodium. However, the conductivity mechanisms of this promising class of materials are currently poorly understood. Herein, high frequency impedance measurements up to 108 Hz shed light on the contributions of grains and grain boundaries to the total impedance, including the distribution of relaxation time constants of the fully crystallized material. In addition, analysis of the temperature dependence allows separation of electrode contributions and determination of activation energies for grain and grain boundary conductivities. Our study provides the basis for fine-tuning the stoichiometry of NaPSiO-based glass-ceramics in terms of maximizing the conductive phase fraction to optimize the performance of future solid-state sodium batteries.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1007/s12633-021-01496-4
Hydrothermal Deposition of PCN-224 on 3D-Printed Porous β-Ca2SiO4 Scaffolds for Bone Regeneration,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.3D-printed bioceramics derived from silicone resin are of great interest in bone tissue engineering owing to their simple processes and low cost. Herein, PCN-224, as a subclass of metal−organic frameworks (MOFs), is successfully fabricated and deposited on the surface of 3D-printed porous β-Ca2SiO4 (C2S) scaffolds. The composite scaffolds possess uniform interconnected macropores (≈400 μm), with increased porosity and slower degradation. The results indicate that deposition of PCN-224 significantly promotes cell proliferation and the expression of osteogenesis-related genes. Moreover, the composite scaffolds significantly improve calvarial defect healing in rats, compared with C2S scaffolds. Therefore, the PCN-224-modified 3D-printed porous C2S composite scaffolds are promising candidates for bone tissue engineering.",Advanced Engineering Materials,10.1007/s12633-021-01487-5
Glass and Glass-Ceramics Based on Weathered Basaltic Rock for Radiation Shielding Applications,"© 2021, Springer Nature B.V.Different batches of weathered basalt ranging from 100 to 50 %, in combination with by-pass cement dust, were used to prepare the glass compositions. Different techniques utilized such as differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, density, FTIR, the mass attenuation coefficients, appropriate atomic number (Zeff), and effective electron density (Neff), were examined for the prepared glass and glass-ceramics samples at different photon energies. In the present study, it was revealed that as the molar volume decreases, the density increases. The experimental and theoretical effects of the mass attenuation component were mostly consistent at different energies. The results revealed that glass samples (WB100) containing a higher percentage of basaltic rocks demonstrated higher radiation protection than those with lower rate (WB50). In addition, glass-ceramics displayed enhanced radiation and gamma rays protection than glass. Therefore, we recommend using glass- ceramics containing 100 % basalt as a protective shield against gamma rays with a lower thickness and higher protection.",Silicon,10.1098/rspa.2022.0026
Novel Methods for Adding Metal Oxides Nanoparticles to Bioactive Glass 58S Matrix: A Characterization and Bioactivity Evaluation Study,"© 2021, Springer Nature B.V.The goal of the present study is to investigate the effect of adding MgO and Mn2O3 nanoparticles at two different stages of the sol-gel method synthesis procedure of 58S bioactive glass on the bioactivity of the synthesized nanocomposites. Characterization tests including SEM, XRD, and FTIR were carried out on the novel bioactive nanocomposites, composed of MgO and Mn2O3 nanoparticles added at the beginning and ending stages of the sol-gel process, before and after in vitro bioactivity evaluation. XRD results showed that adding MgO nanoparticles at the initial stage of the synthesis process (25 Mg-58S) resulted in a glass-ceramic structure with crystalline phases of Forsterite, Monticellite, and tri-calcium phosphate, while the 58S-25Mg sample containing MgO nanoparticles added at the ending stage showed an almost amorphous structure. To implement in vitro test, nanocomposite powders were soaked in the simulated body fluid (SBF) at different time intervals of 14 and 28 days. The obtained results revealed that adding both metal oxide nanoparticles at the initial stage of the synthesis process of 58S bioactive glass led to samples with higher bioactivity in comparison to those nanocomposites synthesized by adding nanoparticles at the ending stage. Also, the 25 Mg-58S nanocomposite possessed the highest bioactivity among all prepared samples due to its special phase structure.",Silicon,10.1021/acsnano.2c02557
Deeply subwavelength giant monopole elastodynamic metacluster resonators,"© 2022 The Authors.The giant monopole resonance is a well-known phenomenon, employed to tune the dynamic response of composite materials comprising voids in an elastic matrix which has a bulk modulus much greater than its shear modulus, e.g. elastomers. This low frequency resonance (e.g. λp/a≈100 for standard elastomers, where λp and a are the compressional wavelength and void radius, respectively) has motivated acoustic material design over many decades, exploiting the subwavelength regime. Despite this widespread use, the manner by which the resonance arising from voids in close proximity is affected by their interaction is not understood. Here, we illustrate that for planar elastodynamics (circular cylindrical voids), coupling due to near-field shear significantly modifies the monopole (compressional) resonant response. We show that by modifying the number and configuration of voids in a metacluster, the directionality, scattering amplitude and resonant frequency can be tailored and tuned. Perhaps most notably, metaclusters deliver a lower frequency resonance than a single void. For example, two touching voids deliver a reduction in resonant frequency of almost 16% compared with a single void of the same volume. Combined with other resonators, such metaclusters can be used as meta-atoms in the design of elastic materials with exotic dynamic material properties.","Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences",10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164859
"Thermal-Switchable, Trifunctional Ceramic-Hydrogel Nanocomposites Enable Full-Lifecycle Security in Practical Battery Systems","© 2022 American Chemical Society.Thermal runaway (TR) failures of large-format lithium-ion battery systems related to fires and explosions have become a growing concern. Here, we design a smart ceramic-hydrogel nanocomposite that provides integrated thermal management, cooling, and fire insulation functionalities and enables full-lifecycle security. The glass-ceramic nanobelt sponges exhibit high mechanical flexibility with 80% reversible compressibility and high fatigue resistance, which can firmly couple with the polymer-nanoparticle hydrogels and form thermal-switchable nanocomposites. In the operating mode, the high enthalpy of the nanocomposites enables efficient thermal management, thereby preventing local temperature spikes and overheating under extremely fast charging conditions. In the case of mechanical or thermal abuse, the stored water can be immediately released, leaving behind a highly flexible ceramic matrix with low thermal conductivity (42 mW m-1 K-1 at 200 °C) and high-temperature resistance (up to 1300 °C), thus effectively cooling the TR battery and alleviating the devastating TR propagation. The versatility, self-adaptivity, environmental friendliness, and manufacturing scalability make this material highly attractive for practical safety assurance applications.",ACS Nano,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164923
"Up-conversion luminescence, temperature sensitive and energy storage performance of lead-free transparent Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped Ba2NaNb5O15 glass-ceramics","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, a new type of Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped lead-free glass-ceramics (GCs) containing Ba2NaNb5O15 nanocrystals was synthesized via traditional melt-quenching and controlled crystallization. The research results illustrate that a transparency of GCs can reach 50% at wavelength of 600 nm and the up-conversion (UC) luminous performance of GCs has been improved obviously compared with precursor glass (PG). And the dual-mode temperature measurement was carried out by fluorescence intensity ratio technology. Using thermally/non-thermally coupled energy levels (TCELs/non-TCELs), the maximum absolute sensitivities of Sa-max (TCELs) and Sa-max (non-TCELs) are 0.65% K−1 and 0.68% K−1, and the maximal relative sensitivities of Sr-max (TCELs) and Sr-max (non-TCELs) are 1.19% K−1 and 0.90% K−1, respectively. Furthermore, the discharge energy density (Wd) of 1.53 J cm−3 and the instantaneous discharge power density of 370 MW cm−3 with ultra-fast discharge time of 7 ns are simultaneously achieved in the GCs. These findings reveal the potential applications of new lead-free transparent Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped Ba2NaNb5O15 GCs for optical temperature measurement and energy storage.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1039/d2ce00667g
Crystallization-temperature controlled alkali-free niobate glass-ceramics with high energy storage density and actual discharge energy density,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The niobate-based alkali-free ferroelectric glass-ceramics were realized through the synthesis of mother glass by way of melt-annealing technique, followed by temperature-controlled crystallization. As the crystallization temperature raised, the ratio of the ferroelectric crystal phase precipitated in the mother glass enhanced continuously, resulting in the enlargement of the permittivity. Attribute to the rise of grain size, pores and cracks tend to appear in the microstructure of glass-ceramics with high crystallization temperature, leading to lower breakdown strength. The theoretical simulation was applied to reveal the internal mechanism, exploring the outcome of heat treatment temperature on the breakdown electric field. The maximum theoretical energy storage density reaches to 18.44 J/cm3 at the crystallization temperature of 800 °C. The single-layer capacitor made from the G800 sample exhibited extremely high power density (230 MW/cm3) and superior actual discharge energy density (1.5 J/cm3) at 600 kV/cm. These results indicate that alkali-free niobate-based glass-ceramics is a kind of encouraging candidate material for pulse capacitors.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.127810
Solid solutions based on BaZn2Si2O7 with thermal expansions from negative to highly positive - a review,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The compound BaZn2Si2O7 shows a transition from a monoclinic low temperature phase to an orthorhombic high temperature phase at 280 °C which is accompanied by an increase in the volume of 3.3%. The temperature of the phase transition can be shifted to higher temperature by a replacement of Zn2+ by Mg2+ or the divalent transition metal cations, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+ or Cu2+ as well as by the replacement of Si4+ by Ge4+. By contrast, the replacement of Ba2+ by Sr2+ leads to the shift of the phase transition to lower temperatures. The coefficient of thermal expansion of the low temperature phase is exceptionally high and in the range from 10 to 15 10−6 K−1, while that of the high temperature phase is small or even negative. The reason of the latter effect is a rotation of bridged ZnO4 tetrahedra in opposite directions. This results in a strongly negative thermal expansion of the b-axis, while the expansion of the a- and c-axes are positive. Although melts of the stoichiometric compounds do not build a continuous network, glass formation can be achieved by the addition nucleation inhibitors, such as ZrO2, Al2O3 or La2O3 or an excess of SiO2. The quenched glasses crystallize at the surface while bulk crystallization is not observed. This changes if noble metals or higher concentrations of ZrO2, WO3 or P2O5 are added to the glass, then also bulk crystallization is possible. Homogeneously crystallized glass ceramics can also be obtained, by sinter crystallization of powdered glass or using sol-gel derived crystalline powders. Adjusting the composition of the respective solid solutions enables to tailor the coefficient of thermal expansion from negative to highly positive values.",CrystEngComm,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121626
Materials characterization of FRP composite seismic retrofits after long-term service in a subarctic Alaskan environment,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThis study assesses physical and chemical properties of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials aged in Alaska's subarctic climate. Carbon FRP (CFRP) and glass FRP (GFRP) samples were collected in 2019 from the exterior and interior of Ted Stevens International Airport (TSIA, retrofitted in 2008) and McKinley Tower (MKT, retrofitted in 2004). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to measure glass transition temperature (Tg) and physical aging, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate potential chemical degradation and degree of cure, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate cross-sectional microstructure, respectively. The results indicate that exposure to the subarctic climate had minimal effect on the composites’ Tg and chemical properties. The variability in fiber content at MKT and thermal properties at TSIA suggest there were likely some inconsistencies in the FRP installation that may affect load-carrying capacity. Furthermore, some microcracks were observed in the FRP retrofits which may have resulted from a combination of poor fiber impregnation and thermal cycling.",Construction and Building Materials,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.132285
The structure and properties of chemical strengthened transparent lithium disilicate glass ceramics with various P2O5 contents,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transparent lithium aluminosilicate glass-ceramics with P2O5 and ZrO2 as nucleating agents were prepared, and the effects of P2O5 contents on the glass network structure, crystallization behavior, and properties were investigated. A small amount of P2O5 addition can improve the Q3 tetrahedral proportion in the glass network. When the amount of P2O5 is 0.8 mol%, the Q3 content increase to 65.6%, facilitating the conversion of Li2SiO3 to Li2Si2O5. The transmittance of glass-ceramics with the main crystalline phases of LiAlSi4O10 and Li2Si2O5 was ∼85% in the visible wavelength range.

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed the formation of the orthorhombic and body-centered cubic crystalline structure of PWNPs and IWNCs. An increase in roughness of IWNCs than PWNPs was evident through atomic force microscopy (AFM), which in turn increases the electrical conductivity of IWNCs. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) for PWNPs and IWNCs were investigated as electron-transport layers in planar DSSCs. The integration of indium in the tungsten oxide layer led to enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 4.69% due to the electron transfer and reduced back-recombination.",Materials Letters,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.030
"Effects of heat treatment temperature and CeO2 content on the phase composition, structure, and properties of monazite phosphate-based glass-ceramics","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The influences of heat treatment temperature and CeO2 content on the phase composition, structure, and properties of the monazite phosphate-based glass-ceramics prepared by a glass melt-quenching process were investigated. The results show that the CeO2 addition promotes the formation of monazite CePO4 phase but restrains the Fe(PO3)3 and Fe4(PO4)2O phases formed. The batches with high CeO2 content should be heat treated at higher temperatures to obtain the glass-ceramics with a single monazite CePO4 phase. Moreover, the mechanisms of the variations are discussed. At the heat treatment temperatures of ≤1200°C, the as-prepared glass-ceramics show good aqueous durability and the main networks of pyrophosphate and orthophosphate groups. The CeO2 loading can be increased up to 16 mol% from ∼9 mol% by forming the glass-ceramics through the melt-quenching process. The conclusions provide researchers with the roles of temperature and CeO2 in preparing monazite phosphate-based glass-ceramics as potential hosts for specific nuclear waste.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121629

X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the crystallization of the nano-Zn4O(BO2)6, LiV6O13 and Li0·74(Ti3O6) phases along with glass matrix. Photoluminescence emission spectrum also confirmed the crystallization of nanostructured Zn4O(BO2)6 in the glass matrix. The glass ceramics contain various borate groups as observed in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. The optical band gap of glass-ceramics lies in the range of 3.46–3.56eV. Fast and maximum degradation efficiency (72%) is observed for organic methylene blue dye for glass heat-treated at 520 °C for 10 min.

The crystalline phases, isolated at the established temperatures, are characterized by XRD method. A theoretically substantiated method for processing thermograms in the region of combined crystallization-melting peaks made it possible to establish the dependences of the crystallization parameters on the composition of crushed glass samples simulating nucleation centers, to find the compositions with highest stability against crystallization, and to recommend the time-temperature modes for the synthesis of glass-ceramics.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121625
Structural and luminescence characterization of europium-doped niobium germanate glasses and glass-ceramics: Novel insights from 93Nb solid-state NMR spectroscopy,"© 2022A thorough understanding of network former roles in optical glasses and glass-ceramics, as well as structural environments of luminescent rare-earth atoms, is paramount to assessing their suitability and effectiveness as components for fully-optical integrated devices. The present contribution sheds light on the overall poorly understood structural role of Nb2O5 in oxide glasses and offers a rationale for the luminescence changes concomitant to the heat-treatment induced glass-to-crystal transition in niobium germanate glasses. To this end, results from 93Nb nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Raman, and Eu3+ ion based luminescence spectroscopies as well as 3D micromanufacturing are reported for glasses and glass-ceramics in system (89.9-x)GeO2-xNb2O5-10K2O-0.1Eu2O3. Thanks to very-fast 93Nb magic-angle spinning (MAS) and a novel excitation scheme for Triple-quantum (TQ)MAS solid-state NMR spectroscopy distinct Nb(OGe)6-y(ONb)y species were identified for the first time: at low Nb concentrations structural units with rather low y-values are formed, reaching down to isolated Nb(OGe)6 units – next to units bearing non-bridging oxygen atoms; at intermediate Nb contents and beyond, structural units with increasingly higher y-values up to Nb(ONb)6 are found, resembling the local environments found in crystalline Nb2O5. After the glass-to-crystal transition the Nb local environment maintains a high degree of disorder while some residual glass remains. Moreover, photoluminescence spectroscopy of the europium probes suggests the rare-earth ions are preferentially incorporated into high y-value Nb(OGe)6-y(ONb)y polyhedra based on spectral features such as the phonon sideband, the 5D0 → 7F2/7F1 ratio, and split 4f bands. Finally, femtosecond laser microfabrication of waveguides was successful in the presented europium-doped niobium germanate glasses, making them promising candidates for further studies as photonic devices.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121585

Regions of structural inhomogeneity are formed in glasses during their casting, cooling and annealing. Their composition depends on the type and concentration of TM and RE ions and determines the difference in phase assemblage of glass-ceramics. In optical ceramics, RE ions do not enter the structure of ZnO crystals, but are located on their surface and form the RE2O3 phase.

The Kissinger method was used to calculate the crystallization kinetics of spinel glass-ceramics, and the crystallization activation energy was 381 kJ/mol. The grain size and content of the crystalline phase become higher with the rising crystallization temperature, and the transparency of glass-ceramics decreased. In terms of mechanical properties, raising the crystallization temperature induced higher microhardness and hence the bending strength first increased and then decreased. In the optimal preparation condition (810 °C/2 h + 1000 °C/2 h), the colorless and transparent glass-ceramics had excellent overall properties, with a microhardness of 9.3 GPa and bending strength of 170 MPa.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.311
Neural networks applied in kinetic analysis of complex nucleation-growth processes: Outstanding solution for fully overlapping reaction mechanisms,"© 2022Performance of several neural network architectures (convolutional neural network CNN, multilayer perceptron MLP, CNN/MLP hybrid CDD) was evaluated for kinetic analysis of complex processes with overlapping independent reaction mechanisms based on the nucleation-growth Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) model. Theoretically simulated data used for the testing covered absolute majority of real-life JMA-JMA solid-state kinetics scenarios. The performance of the tested architectures decreased in the following order: MLP > CDD >> CNN. For partially overlapping processes the CDD and MLP architectures provided accurate estimates of the JMA model kinetic parameters, performing on par with traditional methods of kinetic analysis. For the fully overlapping kinetic processes, the accuracy of the estimates provided by the neural networks significantly worsened, however still largely outperforming the traditional approaches of kinetic analysis based on the standard non-linear optimization, such as mathematic or kinetic deconvolution. The corresponding kinetic predictions were of suitable precision for majority of real-life applications preparation (glass-ceramics).",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.281
"Effect of aluminium oxide, titanium oxide, hydroxyapatite filled dental restorative composite materials on physico-mechanical properties","© 2022The effects of nano-hydroxyapatite in micro-aluminum oxide and titanium oxide on the physical, chemical, and mechanical characteristics of dental resin composite series (DHA and DHT) were investigated in this work. For each series, five distinct formulations were created by combining weight percentages (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 wt%) of nano-hydroxyapatite. For each dental formulation, the amount of aluminium oxide and titanium oxide remained consistent (20 wt%). A statistical analysis was used for result analysis and the significance level was 0.05. The DOC of hybrid Al2O3-nHA dental composites was 77, 72, 66, 64, and 61%, while 74, 70, 63, 61, and 60% for hybrid TiO2-nHA dental restorative composites. The highest water sorption was found in DHT8 (28.83 μg/mm3). The diminishing tendency was recorded in polymerization shrinkage and depth of cure. The higher compressive strength (201 MPa), flexural strength (92 MPa), and Vickers hardness (45 Hv) were found in the DHA8 dental composite. Superior results were observed in DHA than DHT dental composites.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ssc.2022.114758
Effect of MgO/Al2O3 ratio on the crystallization behaviour of Li2O–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramic and its wettability on Si3N4 ceramic,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The composition governs the crystallization ability, the type and content of crystal phases of glass-ceramics. Glass-ceramic joining materials have generated more research interest in recent years. Here, we prepared a novel Li2O–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramic for the application of joining Si3N4 ceramics. We investigated the influence of the MgO/Al2O3 composition ratio on microstructure and crystallization behaviour. The crystallization kinetics demonstrated that the glasses had excellent crystallization ability and high crystallinity. β-LiAlSi2O6 and Mg2SiO4 were precipitated from the glass-ceramics, and the increase of MgO concentration was conducive to the precipitation of Mg2SiO4. Among the glass-ceramic samples, the thermal expansion coefficient of LMAS2 glass-ceramic was 3.1 × 10−6/°C, which was very close to that of Si3N4 ceramics. The wetting test showed that the final contact angle of the glass droplet on the Si3N4 ceramic surface was 32° and the interface was well bonded.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164776
Crystallization and microstructure in K2O substituted SiO2–MgO–Al2O3–Li2O–AlPO4 glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe substitution of K+ ion by Ca2+ or Sr2+ in K2O–SiO2–MgO–Al2O3–B2O3–MgF2–Li2O–AlPO4 glass is executed and the relevant effects on crystallization and microstructure are explored. The glass monoliths obtained by single-step melt-quenching at 1500 ± 10 °C were transparent in nature. Density of base glass was evaluated as 2.66 ± 0.03 g cm−3 and found to be decreased by in presence of CaO or SrO. Opaque glass-ceramics were derived from the transparent glasses by controlled heat-treatment at 1000 ± 10 °C and the predominant crystalline phase was identified as fluorophlogopite mica, KMg3AlSi3O10F2 by X-ray diffraction. Field emission scanning electron microscopy revel that the plate like fluorophlogopite mica crystals predominated in base glass-ceramic (without CaO or SrO doped) but changed to nanocrystalline morphology containing droplet like spherical shaped mica crystallites (average size 200–400 nm) on addition of CaO and SrO. Highest density (=2.74 ± 0.03 g.cm-3) observed for SrO containing glass-ceramic is attributed to the nanocrystalline morphology.",Solid State Communications,10.1016/j.jobe.2022.104361
Novel transparent Tb3+-activated Na2GdF7 glass ceramics for low-lying state thermal coupling principle,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Oxy-fluoride glass ceramics (GC), which are composed of glass phase and equally distributed fluoride nano-crystals, are regarded as promising host materials employed to optical thermometer. Herein, novel Na2GdF7:xTb3+ (x = 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.06) GC with high transparency were well fabricated and applied to low-lying state thermal coupling principle. The structural, micro-topography and fluorescence spectra properties of these samples were completely researched via XRD, TEM, HRTEM, SAED and photoluminescence. When excited by 378 nm laser, the luminescence of Na2GdF7:0.3Tb3+ GC was increased 1.5 times compared with precursor glass. More importantly, the Na2GdF7:0.3Tb3+ GC sample (λex = 541.8 nm) was devoted to low-lying state thermal coupling principle. The strategy endows excellent relative sensitivity and superior temperature resolution which are 2.33% K−1 at 310 K and 0.06 K at 670 K, respectively. These findings suggest potential optical materials and a strategy for optical fiber temperature sensing.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c00857
A multi-objective optimization framework for seismic resilience enhancement of typical existing RC buildings,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdStructural retrofitting is a common approach to increase the resilience of the existing buildings (e.g., office buildings) in the industrial (e.g., refinery) sites against earthquakes. In this study, a typical RC structure that used as operational office building is considered, for which a multi-objective framework is proposed to select the retrofit patterns that are optimized for seismic resilience index and cost of retrofit of these buildings. For this purpose, three different jacketing materials (i.e., Steel, CFRP and GFRP) with four various thicknesses for each one (1.2, 2.4, 3.6 and 4.8 mm for Steel, and 1 to 4 plies for CFRP and GFRP) are chosen to retrofit these buildings. In addition, six different plans are considered for the retrofit designs. Besides, three seismic intensity levels from low to severe seismic intensities with different distances ranging from near-to far-field are taken into account to determine the sensitivity of responses. For each scenario, the fragility values for calculating the seismic resilience index, and the cost of retrofit are obtained, and then the optimal set of solutions is calculated by applying the well-established non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. The results show that the structural retrofitting not only reduces the sensitivity of the structural response to different seismic inputs in a limited range, but also improves the performance of the structure in terms of resilience index especially at higher intensities. The proposed framework provides a method for decision makers to choose optimal retrofit strategies that minimize the corresponding costs, while achieving a predesigned resilience's level for an infrastructure system.",Journal of Building Engineering,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.127687
"Ln2Te6O15(Ln = La, Gd, and Eu) ""Anti-Glass"" Phase-Assisted Lanthanum-Tellurite Transparent Glass-Ceramics: Eu3+Emission and Local Site Symmetry Analysis","© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The presence of lanthanide-tellurite ""anti-glass"" nanocrystalline phases not only affects the transparency in glass-ceramics (GCs) but also influences the emission of a dopant ion. Therefore, a methodical understanding of the crystal growth mechanism and local site symmetry of doped luminescent ions when embedded into the precipitated ""anti-glass"" phase is crucial, which unfolds the practical applications of GCs. Here, we examined the Ln2Te6O15""anti-glass"" nanocrystalline phase growth mechanism and local site symmetry of Eu3+ions in transparent GCs produced from 80TeO2-10TiO2-(5 - x)La2O3-5Gd2O3-xEu2O3glasses, where x = 0, 1, 2. A crystallization kinetics study identifies a unique crystal growth mechanism via a constrained nucleation rate. The extent of ""anti-glass"" phase precipitation and its growth in GCs with respect to heat-treatment duration is demonstrated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis. Qualitative analysis of XRD confirms the precipitation of both La2Te6O15and Gd2Te6O15nanocrystalline phases. Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction patterns reveals that Eu3+ions occupy ""Gd"" sites in Gd2Te6O15over ""La"" sites in La2Te6O15. Raman spectroscopy reveals the conversion of TeO3units to TeO4units with Eu2O3addition. This confirms the polymerizing role of Eu2O3and consequently high crystallization tenacity with increasing Eu2O3concentration. The measured Eu3+ion photoluminescence spectra revealed its local site symmetry. Moreover, the present GCs showed adequate thermal cycling stability (∼50% at 423 K) with the highest activation energy of around 0.3 eV and further suggested that the present transparent GCs would be a potential candidate for the fabrication of red-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or red component phosphor in W-LEDs.",Inorganic Chemistry,10.11896/cldb.21040028
Effect of immediate dentin sealing on the fracture strength of lithium disilicate ceramic onlays,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of immediate dentin sealing (IDS) on the fracture strength of ceramic onlays when compared with delayed dentin sealing (DDS). Twenty extracted human maxillary premolars were randomly divided into 2 groups according to the dentin sealing technique (n=10). A standardized mesio-occlusal-distal cavity was prepared with reduction of the palatal cusp. The dentin surfaces of the IDS group were immediately sealed after finishing the preparation (before taking impressions, temporization, and 14-day storage at 37°C) using a bonding system (ALL-BOND 3®, ALL-BOND 3® RESIN) and flowable composite (Te-Econom Flow). Impressions were made and temporary restorations were fabricated using PRO-V FILL®. The wax patterns were milled and the onlays were fabricated by heat-pressing technique (IPS e.max Press). After bonding the final restorations with resin cement (Variolink N), the specimens were thermocycled. Fracture strength was measured using a universal testing machine (Testometric M350-10KN) at 1 mm/min until failure occurred. Student's t-test was used to evaluate the results of the fracture strength test. The failure mode was examined using a stereomicroscope. The mean fracture strength in the IDS group (1335 ± 335 N) was statistically significantly higher than that for the DDS group (931 ± 274 N) (p < 0.05). Fracture of the restoration with a small portion of the tooth was the most frequent mode of failure. Within the limitation of this in vitro study, there was an improvement in the fracture strength of ceramic onlays with the use of IDS. However, the ceramic onlays were strong enough to withstand the physiological mastication force in both groups.",Swiss dental journal,10.3389/fchem.2022.915335
Effect of simulated hygrothermal environment on the flexural and interlaminar shear strength of particulate-filled epoxy-coated GFRP composites,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe application of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites in civil engineering and construction has gained significant interest in the last decade. Such applications require information on the long-term performance and durability of fiber composite materials because these materials are directly exposed to aggressive environments. This comparative study evaluated the effect of a simulated hygrothermal environment on the durability of GFRP composite laminates with and without a particulate-filled epoxy coating. The three-point bending test was conducted to characterize the degradation of interlaminar shear strength and flexural properties of GFRP composites before and after conditioning at combined high moisture and temperature for 0, 1000, 2000, or 3000 h. Dynamic mechanical analysis was also conducted to characterize the changes in the thermomechanical properties of the composite laminates. The results show that hygrothermal conditioning had a negative impact on the flexural and interlaminar shear strength of uncoated GFRP laminates, but this could be efficiently minimized with the use of a particulate-filled polymer-epoxy coating.",Construction and Building Materials,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.127539
High-strength Diffusion Bonding of Carbon / Carbon Composites Based on Si-CaO / Al2O3-Si Sandwich Structure 基于 Si-CaO / Al2O3-Si 三明治结构的碳 / 碳复合材料高强度扩散连接,"© 2022 Cailiao Daobaoshe/ Materials Review. All rights reserved.A sandwich structure layer is formed by sequentially laying Si, CaO / Al2 O3 glass-ceramics (referred to as CA) and Si slurry coatings on the surface of the carbon / carbon (referred to as C / C) composites. Joining of the C / C composites to itself is realized by hot press diffusion bonding. The wettability between C/ C composites and glass-ceramics is poor, whereas Si and C have a good affinity. It is thus expected that SiC is generated through in-situ reaction between Si and C matrix under high temperature, while Si and CA undergo mutual diffusion and chemical reaction to form silicate glass. By this means, glass-ceramics can be used to join C/ C composites. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the joints were studied. Results show that the cracks and holes on the joint connecting layer are reduced and the connecting layer becomes denser with the extension of the heat preservation time. Under the conditions of 1 480 ℃, 0.5—1 MPa and holding time of 90 min, the shear strength of the resulting joint at room temperature reaches 30. 45 MPa. The molten interlayer product has good wettability with the C/ C composites, and penetrates the voids of the C/ C composites matrix to form a ‘pinning structure’, thereby improving the shear strength of the joints.",Cailiao Daobao/Materials Reports,10.11607/ijp.7563
Super Broadband at Telecom Wavelengths From RE3+-Doped SiO2-Ta2O5 Glass Ceramics Planar Waveguides,"Copyright © 2022 De Oliveira Lima, Caixeta, Souza, Rosa, Soares, Crumo, Borin, Ferrari and Gonçalves.This paper reports on the preparation of Er3+/Yb3+/Tm3+, Er3+/Yb3+/Nd3+, and Er3+/Tm3+/Nd3+ triply doped and Er3+-doped SiO2-Ta2O5 glass ceramic nanocomposites and active planar waveguides by the sol–gel process using the dip-coating technique as deposition method. The investigation of their structural, morphological, and luminescent properties using XRD, AFM, and photoluminescence analysis, are reported here. The XRD results showed the presence of L-Ta2O5 nanocrystals dispersed in the SiO2-based amorphous host for all the nanocomposites and films. The rare earth ion (RE3+) doping concentration affected both the crystallinity, and the crystallite sizes of the Ta2O5 dispersed into SiO2-Ta2O5 nanocomposites and waveguides. AFM characterization revealed crack free and smooth surface roughness and differences in viscoelasticity on the Er3+-doped SiO2-Ta2O5 films surface, which allows the identification of Ta2O5 nanocrystals on the SiO2 amorphous host. The Er3+ doped and triply doped SiO2-Ta2O5 nanocomposites displayed broad- and super broadband NIR emissions with a FWHM up to 173 nm achieved in the telecom wavelengths. The lifetime of the 4I13/2 emitting level of the Er3+-doped SiO2-Ta2O5 waveguides is strongly dependent on Er3+ concentration and an emission quenching was negligible up to 0.81 mol%. The structural and luminescent investigations indicated that RE3+-doped SiO2-Ta2O5 glass ceramics are promising candidates for photonic applications in optical devices operating in wide wavelengths at the telecom bands.",Frontiers in Chemistry,10.3390/ma15145002
Green manufacturing of silicate materials using desert sand as a raw-material resource,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe deepening conflict between the increasing use of inorganic products and the decreasing mineral resources and the serious desertization trend oblige us to accelerate the industrial application of desert sand for a sustainable development. Desert-sand contains different sizes of granules and consists of 55–85 wt% of SiO2 and rests of Al2O3, CaO, Fe2O3, TiO2, Na2O, and MgO in nominal composition, which is an alternative for raw material of silicate materials; the use of desert sand to manufacture silicate materials connects the low-cost manufacturing, raw-material resource, ecology environment, and social and economic developments to sustainability. Therefore, the present study analyzes the necessity and possibility of the project, illustrates the physical and chemical characterizations of desert sands, summarizes the current research and applications of desert-sands for pavement materials, cements, concrete, glass, ceramics, and granular bulk materials, as well as extraction of high-purity (hydr-)oxides, points out issues that restrict the development and applications of desert-sand and makes relevant countermeasures and suggestions. Finally, the application prospect of the project is predicted.

Digital Veneering Techniques for Zirconia Implant-Supported Single Crowns-Bond Strength and Clinical Application,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) of different digital veneering techniques for zirconia and to critically discuss its suitability for application in single-implant prosthetics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 112 square-shaped zirconia specimens were provided with four different veneering materials (n = 28 per group): a glass-ceramic (group GLA), a feldspathic ceramic (group FEL), a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (group PIC), and a resin nanoceramic (group RNC). Discs in group GLA were sintered onto the core material, whereas all other specimens were adhesively connected. In each group, 14 specimens (GLA0, FEL0, PIC0, RNC0) were subjected to SBS testing before thermocycling, and the other 14 (GLA1, FEL1, PIC1, RNC1) were tested after thermocycling (10,000 cycles). Data were analyzed by applying SPSS software (P < .05). The surfaces and fracture patterns of the specimens were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Mean SBS values ranged from 14.09 ± 3.87 MPa (RNC1) to 40.82 ± 4.91 MPa (GLA0). Group GLA presented higher values than all other groups (P < .001). Groups FEL, PIC, and RNC showed no statistically significant differences between them. SBS decreased after thermocycling, but no significant impact was found. Every group exhibited a characteristic failure mode. CONCLUSION: All digital veneering techniques sufficed to present clinically acceptable SBS values and might be viable alternatives in implant prosthetics. However, some have yet to demonstrate their long-term clinical suitability. At present, lithium disilicate-veneered zirconia abutments and monolithic lithium disilicate hybrid abutment crowns seem to present a proven and reliable restorative option.",The International journal of prosthodontics,10.4103/jcd.jcd-184-22
New Chalcogenide Glass-Ceramics Based on Ge-Zn-Se for IR Applications,"© 2022 by the authors.The consumer market requests infrared (IR) optical components, made of relatively abundant and environmentally friendly materials, to be integrated or attached to smartphones. For this purpose, three new chalcogenides samples, namely Ge23.3Zn30.0Se46.7 (d_GZSe-1), Ge26.7Zn20.0Se53.3 (d_GZSe-2) and Ba4.0Ge12.0Zn17.0Se59.0I8.0 (d_GZSe-3) were obtained by mechanical alloying and processed by spark plasma sintering into dense bulk disks. Obtaining a completely amorphous and homogeneous material proved to be difficult. d_GZSe-2 and d_GZSe-3 are glass-ceramics with the amount of the amorphous phase being 19.7 and 51.4 wt. %, while d_GZSe-1 is fully polycrystalline. Doping with barium and iodine preserves the amorphous phase formed by milling and lowers the sintering temperature from 350 °C to 200 °C. The main crystalline phase in all of the prepared samples is cubic ZnSe or cubic Zn0.5Ge0.25Se, while in d_GZSe-3 the amorphous phase contains GeSe4 clusters. The color of the first two sintered samples is black (the band gap values are 0.42 and 0.79 eV), while d_GZSe-3 is red (Eg is 1.37 eV) and is transparent in IR domain. These results are promising for future research in IR materials and thin films.",Materials,10.1007/s10717-022-00468-3
Effect of Dolomite Addition on the Structure and Properties of Multicomponent Amphibolite Glasses,"© 2022 by the authors.The structure and properties of the glass can be modified by introducing appropriate additives. Dolomite is one of the primary raw materials modifying the properties of glass, in which the essential component is calcium-magnesium double carbonate CaCO3∙MgCO3. The paper presents the research results on glasses obtained by smelting pure amphibolite and amphibolite modified with 10 and 20% dolomite additives. The raw material used was mined in the Poland region of Lower Silesia. The glass melting process was carried out in an electric furnace at 1450 °C for 2 h. The structure and properties of the glasses and crystallization products were determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy—Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Viscosity and Vickers microhardness were also measured. It was found that the modification of amphibolite glass by adding dolomite affects the glasses’ properties and structure. The research results determined the effect of dolomite addition on the properties of alumino-silicate glasses in terms of the mineral fibre products used in the construction industry.",Materials,10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2022)07-2130-05
"Comparative evaluation of clinical performance of ceramic and resin inlays, onlays, and overlays: A systematic review and meta analysis","© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.Background: Advances in adhesive technologies and escalation in esthetic demands have increased indications for tooth-colored, partial coverage restorations. Recently, material knowledge has evolved, new materials have been developed, and no systematic review has answered the question posed by practitioners: Is the clinical efficacy of resin or ceramic better, for inlay, onlay, and overlay in the long run? Aim: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the clinical performance of ceramic and resin inlays, onlays, and overlays and to identify the complication types associated with the main clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: Two reviewers (VN and AJ) searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central registry of controlled trials for published articles between 1983 and 2020 conforming to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines for systematic reviews. Only clinical studies which met the following criteria were included (1) studies regarding ceramic and resin inlays, onlays, and overlays were included; (2) randomized controlled trials, retrospective or prospective studies conducted in humans; (3) studies with a dropout rate <50% 4) studies with a follow-up higher than 5 years. Results: Of 1718 articles, 21 articles were selected. At 5 years, the estimated survival rates for resin (n = 129) was 86%, feldspathic porcelain (n = 1048) was 90%, and glass ceramic (n = 2218) was 92%; at 10 years, the survival of resin was 75% (n = 115), feldspathic porcelain was 91% (n = 1829), and glass ceramic was 89% (n = 1075). Conclusion: The meta-regression indicated that ceramic partial coverage restorations (feldspathic porcelain and glass-ceramic) outperformed resin partial coverage restorations both at 5-year and 10-year follow-up. When compared between ceramic types, glass ceramics outperformed feldspathic porcelain at 5 years' follow-up and feldspathic porcelain outperformed glass ceramics at 10 years' follow-up. The failures were mostly due to fractures (6.2%), endodontic problems (3%), secondary caries (1.7%), and debonding which was 0.9%.",Journal of Conservative Dentistry,10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09960
Sol-Gel Production of Alkaline-Free Aluminosilicate Glass Ceramic and Investigation of its Properties,"© 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Glass-ceramic materials in the systems SiO2–Al2O3–RO (RO — MgO, SrO, BaO, and their combinations) were synthesized by the sol-gel method. The factors influencing the sol-gel formation process educed. The effect of the composition and temperature-time regimes of heat treatment on the crystallization properties of gels, phase transformations, phase composition, granulometry, and shape of the resulting particles was investigated. The nature of the phase transformations occurring in powders was educed as a function of the temperature- time conditions of heat treatment. It is shown that, depending on the composition, anorthite or its solid solutions are the dominant crystalline phases, and their formation temperatures were determined: hexagonal celsian at 1350°C, monoclinic strontium anorthite at 1400°C, and cordierite at 1450°C.

Research on Spectral Characteristics and Coloration of Natural Cobalt Spinel 天然钴尖晶石的谱学特征及颜色成因,"© 2022 Science Press. All rights reserved.Spinel[(Mg,Fe,Zn,Mn)(Al,Cr,Fe)2O4] is a magnesium aluminum oxide mineral used for gemstones and glass-ceramics. In recent years, a natural spinel has been found as a gemstone with the color of cornflower blue.It has been loved by collectors and designers and has an increasing price. The cobalt spinels are often cornflower blue and transparent. It shows weak to medium green fluorescence under long-wave ultraviolet and no fluorescence at short-wave. The cobalt spinel with alexandrite effect displayed cornflower blue color in sunlight and purplish-red color in incandescent light. Three natural cobalt spinel samples with spectral characteristics and coloration were investigated with EPMA, FTIR, Raman spectrometer, UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer, and cathodoluminescence spectrometer, and these testing results were compared with those of ordinary spinel without alexandrite effect. The results show that the alexandrite effect and cobalt spinel belong to magnesium spinel. The cobalt spinel was composed of MgO and Al2O3, with an average content of 71.37% and 25.77%, respectively; The contents of transition metals such as Zn, Fe, Co and V were relatively high, and with an average content of 1 333.85, 831.53, 99.52 and 58.26 μg g-1, respectively. It was found that their infrared spectra and Raman spectra are the same as those of ordinary spinel: the infrared spectrum at 517, 589, and 704 cm-1are red-shifted, and the red shift range is 5~33 cm-1, and the Raman peaks are concentrated at 300~800 cm-1. Compared the UV-Vis-NIR-spectra with the results of chemical analysis and cathodoluminescence test, it is suggested that the color of natural cobalt spinel is due to the combined action of electronic transitions in Co2+, Fe3+and V3+contained in the lattice. The spin-forbidden transition4T1g(4 F) 4T1g(4P) of Co2+makes the orange-yellow region (550~630 nm) produce absorption bands, while the transition 3T1g3T1g(3P) of V3+and the transition 4A2 E2 of Cr3+makes the blue-purple region (400~490 nm) absorption lines are generated to uniformly transmit the red and blue light so that it produces alexandrite effect. Discolored cobalt spinels are often cornflower blue in sunlight and purplish-red in incandescent lamps. This research confirmed the spectral characteristics and coloration mechanism of natural cobalt spinels and the alexandrite effect of cobalt spinels. This study provided a basis for their scientific identification of natural cobalt blue spinels and is beneficial for readers to distinguish natural cobalt blue spinels from ordinary blue spinels and synthetic cobalt blue spinels. It has important theoretical research and commercial application value.",Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi/Spectroscopy and Spectral Analysis,10.4322/bds.2022.e3226
"Preparation and characterization of sugilite glass from basalt for α-amylase immobilization, statistical optimization of the immobilization process and description of free and immobilized enzyme","© 2022 The AuthorsBacterial α-amylase was immobilized on sugilite from modified basalt rock as a new carrier. A set of glass compositions based on sugilite formula KNa2M2Li3Si12O30 (M = Al or Mn or Fe) were prepared. The glasses were prepared through melting–quenching technique and samples of glass were converted to glass ceramic. Among the tested glasses and glass ceramic only sugilite glass based on M = Fe (BSF) give promising results. The sugilite BSF glass was characterized using DSC analysis, FTIR absorption, and SEM. The sugilite glass revealed high thermal resistant till ∼770 °C. Under optimized conditions of the Central composite design, the immobilization yield improved by 4.7-fold. The affinity to starch increased after enzyme immobilization by 4.3-fold. The lower rate of deactivation constant and the increase of t½ and D-value confirm the suitability of BSF and immobilization method in enhancing enzyme stability. The improvement in thermostability of immobilized α-amylase was judged by the change in thermodynamic parameters. In conclusion, the prepared sugilite BSF glass can be utilized as a new carrier suitable for stabilization of α-amylase enzyme by immobilization.",Heliyon,10.3390/ma15134647
Zygoma Augmentation With 3D Printed Bioactive Glass-Ceramic Implant,"© 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.Zygoma, which is located at the middle third of the face, has a significant impact on the facial impression with its volume and prominence. CaO-SiO2-P2O5-B2O3glass-ceramics (BGS-7) has been reported as a new alternative of nonresorbable bone grafting material, which has bioactivity of inducing human osteoblast between bone and implant, resulting integration to the bone. Furthermore, its chemical characteristics are similar to bone, resulting in radiopacity with no metallic artifact on the radiographic images. With the development of Computer aided design-Computer aided manufacturing technology, BGS-7 can be manufactured into a patient-specific design. During follow-up periods, 3D printed BGS-7 implant did not displace from the initial recipient site. By cone-beam computed tomography evaluation, a gap between bone and BGS-7 was filled with the radiopacity, which implied bony fusion. Consequently, this clinical case shows that the BGS-7 implant could be an effective and safe graft material for zygoma bone defects.",Journal of Craniofacial Surgery,10.3390/cryst12070899
Color and translucency of repressed lithium disilicate glass ceramic subjected to multiple firings and aging Cor e translucidez da vitrocerâmica de dissilicato de lítio reprensada submetida a múltiplas queimas e ao envelhecimento,"© 2022, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Institute of Science and Technology of Sao Jose dos Campos. All rights reserved.Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of multiple firings and aging on color and translucency of repressed lithium disilicate glass ceramic (IPS e.max press). Material and Methods: A total of 42 lithium disilicate discs (15 mm x 1 mm) were fabricated using heat press technique following the manufacturers’ instructions. They were divided into three groups according to the number of pressing cycles (n=14): Group P1 (pressed once), Group P2 (pressed twice) and Group P3 (pressed thrice). Each group was subdivided into two subgroups according to the number of firing cycles (n=7): Subgroup (F2): 2 firing cycles, Subgroup (F4): 4 firing cycles. Then all specimens were subjected to thermocycling. Color and translucency parameter (TP) were evaluated by spectrophotometer; after pressing, firing (ΔE1: color difference between pressing and firing) and aging (ΔE2: color difference between pressing and aging). Results: ΔE1 for subgroup F2 (3.38) showed statistically significant lower value than ΔE1 for subgroup F4 (3.94). After aging, group P3 showed the statistically significant highest ΔE2 (6.41). A statistically significant lower ΔE2 was found with group P2 (5.55). Group P1 showed the statistically significant lowest ΔE2 (4.28). TP for subgroup F2 (18.27) showed higher value than subgroup F4 (17.78). There was a statistically significant decrease in TP after aging for all tested groups. Conclusion: Increasing the number of firing cycles and aging affected color and translucency of repressed lithium disilicate.",Brazilian Dental Science,10.1364/OME.457319
Mn-Containing Bioactive Glass-Ceramics: BMP-2-Mimetic Peptide Covalent Grafting Boosts Human-Osteoblast Proliferation and Mineral Deposition,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The addition of Mn in bioceramic formulation is gaining interest in the field of bone implants. Mn activates human osteoblast (h-osteoblast) integrins, enhancing cell proliferation with a dose-dependent effect, whereas Mn-enriched glasses induce inhibition of Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. In an effort to further optimize Mn-containing scaffolds’ beneficial interaction with h-osteoblasts, a selective and specific covalent functionalization with a bioactive peptide was carried out. The anchoring of a peptide, mapped on the BMP-2 wrist epitope, to the scaffold was performed by a reaction between an aldehyde group of the peptide and the aminic groups of silanized Mn-containing bioceramic. SEM-EDX, FT-IR, and Raman studies confirmed the presence of the peptide grafted onto the scaffold. In in vitro assays, a significant improvement in h-osteoblast proliferation, gene expression, and calcium salt deposition after 7 days was detected in the functionalized Mn-containing bioceramic compared to the controls.",Materials,10.3390/nano12132187
Crystallization Kinetics of Basalt Glass‐Ceramics Produced from Olivine Basalt Rock,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Glass‐ceramics acquired from the melting of rocks have a vast application marketplace. In this study, an olivine basalt rock from Zhangjiakou in China was selected as a raw material to pre-pare basalt glass‐ceramics, and the crystallization kinetics of olivine basalt glass was investigated using differential thermal analysis. Polarizing microscope and X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis results revealed that the main mineral compositions of olivine basalt are plagioclase, pyroxene, oli-vine, and iron oxide(s). Three crystallization peaks were observed in the DSC curve of the olivine basalt glass. The Avrami exponent (n), apparent activation energies for the crystallization, and glass transition of basalt glass were determined using the Owaza method based on data obtained from isothermal measurements. The crystallization activation energies (E) of the three crystallization peaks of olivine basalt glass were 314.20 kJ/mol, 1232.49 kJ/mol, and 696.89 kJ/mol, respectively. In addition to this, the crystal growth index indicated that the crystallization mode in the olivine basalt glass was surface crystallization. The crystallization phases and microstructure of the olivine basalt glass heated at 860 °C, 1100 °C, and 1180 °C were also studied. The conclusions obtained offer some useful information for the preparation of basalt glass‐ceramics from olivine basalt rocks.",Crystals,10.1007/s41779-022-00768-5
Rayleigh scattering with material dispersion for low volume fraction transparent glass ceramics,"© 2022 Optica Publishing GroupIn this report we review the literature concerning the theory of scattering in transparent glass ceramics (TGCs). The parameters dictating scattering are all relational and include the size of the scatterers relative to the wavelength of propagating light, the volume fraction of crystals relative to the vitreous matrix and the refractive index difference between crystal and glass. We extend the theory by including material dispersion for the case of low, i.e., <5% volume fraction of nanocrystals relative to the vitreous matrix where Rayleigh scattering is appropriate. We examine five crystal-glass sets and calculate the scattering coefficient from the visible to the mid-infrared. We show that for all combinations, the scattering coefficient departs from the fixed refractive index case by as much as 48% at 2.5 µm for BaF2 nanocrystals in an aluminosilictate glass. For every case studied, the addition of material dispersion reduces the dependence on wavelength from the standard λ−p where p = 4 to as much as p = 4.8 for the case of PbF2 nanocrystals in an aluminosilictate glass. For the accurate estimation of the Rayleigh scattering coefficient in a TGC, knowledge of material dispersion is therefore essential.",Optical Materials Express,10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.04.028
In Vivo Evaluation of the Effects of Sintering Temperature on the Optical Properties of Dental Glass-Ceramics,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In prosthodontics, the ability of glass-ceramics to express the optical properties of natural teeth is an important goal of esthetic restorations. Dental restorations do not merely need to be sim-ilar in color to natural teeth; proper optical properties, such as opalescence, transparency, etc., must be combined in order to achieve excellent esthetic effects. The optical properties of ceramic materials are mainly distinguished by different hues (e.g., A, B, C, and D) combined with translucency (e.g., high translucency (HT), medium translucency (MT), low translucency (LT), and medium opacity (MO)). However, there are many varieties of tooth color. Therefore, it is expected that glass-ceramics can change their nanocrystal size and porosity through different heat-treatment temperatures and times and, thereby, present different transparency effects. This study mainly analyzed the influence of changes in sintering temperature on the optical properties of glass-ceramics. The optical properties of glass-ceramics in the oral cavity were evaluated with human trials. We hypothesized that (1) the transparency of glass-ceramics can be changed by controlling the sintering temperature and (2) glass-ceramics modified by the sintering temperature can be suitable for clinical applications. Results showed that the transparency decreased, the nanoparticle size increased, the crystallinity in-creased, and the surface hardness decreased as the sintering temperature increased. High-bright-ness glass-ceramics have more-sensitive optical properties. Results of clinical trials showed that glass-ceramics whose transparency was changed by controlling the sintering temperature can be candidates for clinical applications. Based on the above results, the hypotheses of this study were supported. In the future, we will continue to explore the esthetic field of dental restorations.",Nanomaterials,10.1007/s00339-022-05712-9
Preparation and up-conversion luminescence of NaY(WO4)2: Er3+/Yb3+ glass ceramics under different heat treatment conditions,"© 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Australian Ceramic Society.NaY(WO4)2: Er3+/Yb3+ tungsten silicate glass ceramics were successfully synthesized by melting crystallization method. The crystal pattern, glass transition temperature, and chemical composition of glass ceramics samples were analyzed by XRD, DSC, Raman, and FTIR, respectively. The morphology and location distribution of grain was observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The energy transfer between rare earth ion was investigated by fluorescence spectra. Moreover, the crystal structure of glass ceramics and network structure of glass was also investigated, and the effect of grain precipitation on the structure of glass ceramics was analyzed. The influence of the amount of Er3+/Yb3+ on the luminescence intensity of the glass ceramics was investigated. Under the excitation of 980 nm laser, the glass ceramics samples showed strong green light emission. The strong green light emission at 527 nm and 550 nm consisted of the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 2S3/2 → 4I15/2 energy level transition of Er3+, respectively. Both of two transitions are two photon processes. When the molar ratio of Er3+/Yb3+ is 1:9, the up-conversion luminescence intensity of the glass ceramics samples is the strongest.",Journal of the Australian Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.05.002
Effect of firing cycle and aging on long-term chemical degradation of monolithic CAD-CAM ceramics,"© 2022 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Previous studies have shown the susceptibility of dental ceramics to degradation when subjected to certain media. However, knowledge on the effect of repeated firings and thermocycling on the ion elution of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) ceramics is lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the effect of repeated firings on the ion elution of CAD-CAM materials before and after thermocycling. Material and methods: Bar-shaped specimens were prepared from 4 different CAD-CAM materials (monolithic zirconia [Z], zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic [S], lithium disilicate glass-ceramic [EX], and leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic [E]) and divided into 3 groups according to the number of repeated glaze firings (1 firing [1F], 2 firings [2F], and 4 firings [4F]). Specimens were placed into deionized water (pH 7.4) and stored at 37 °C for 168 hours. Inductively coupled plasma-optic emission spectrophotometry (ICP-OES) was used to measure the baseline values of the eluted ions in immersion. The specimens were then subjected to thermocycling. Then, surface roughness (Ra) and ion elution values were measured. The Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze the ion elution data before and after thermocycling, and the effect of thermocycling on ion elution was assessed by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Ra data were analyzed with 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey honestly significant difference tests (α=.05). Results: Elution of some ions varied depending on the material-firing pair before (Al, As, B, Ba, Cr, Cu, Li, Mg, Na, P, and Zn) and after (Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, K, Li, Mg, Na, P, Y, and Zn) thermocycling. Before thermocycling, all firing groups within each material showed a similar number of significantly higher eluted ions. After thermocycling, the number of significantly higher eluted ions decreased in all materials, except for EX. The effect of thermocycling on the ion elution of the 1F group of Z (Al, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, K, Li, P, Y, and Zn), S (As, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, K, P, and Y), EX (B, Cu, and P), and E (B and Ba); 2F group of Z (Al, Be, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, K, Li, P, and Y), S (Be, Cd, Co, K, Li, and Y), EX (P), and E (P); 4F group of Z (Al, As, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, K, Li, P, and Y), S (Al, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Li, Mg, and Y), EX (Be, Ca, Cd, Co, K, Y, and Zn), and E (Ca and P) was nonsignificant (P≥.051). The interaction between material and repeated firings (P<.001) had a significant effect on Ra. For 1F groups, E showed the highest Ra (P≤.003), while Z had higher Ra than S (P=.009). For 2F groups, Z had higher Ra than S (P=.01). The differences among 4F groups were nonsignificant (P≥.677). An increased number of repeated firings (2F and 4F) decreased the Ra of E (P<.001). Conclusions: The effect of repeated firings and thermocycling on the chemical stability of the tested CAD-CAM materials varied. No clear trend was observed on the elution of different ions within material-firing pairs before thermocycling. However, thermocycling increased the number of significantly higher eluted ions for EX. The effect of thermocycling on the ion elution of materials varied depending on ions. Repeated firings decreased the surface roughness of E.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1016/j.cma.2022.115126
Substitution and crystallisation of fluortremolite glasses with needle-like crystal morphology,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.The effect of Ca2+ and Fe2+/3+ substitutions for Mg2+ on the crystallisation of fluortremolite (Ca2Mg5Si8O22F2) glass ceramic was investigated by the melting of selected glass compositions at 1550 °C and thermal treatment at 950 °C. Ca2+ is essential to generate the favoured crystal phase fluortremolite. The needle-like crystal morphology can be achieved by adding iron oxide and results in a fluoractinolite crystal phase. The DTA, XRD, SEM and TEM methods were used to identify the mechanism of phase separation of these high fluorine-containing compositions and understand the generation of the selected crystal phase. The substitution with chromium, indium, manganese and nickel offers a variety of properties for this fluoramphibole glass ceramic and as high-strength material for technical application.",Applied Physics A: Materials Science and Processing,10.1002/ente.202200072
Effect of artificial aging on the translucency of monolithic zirconia materials sintered at different temperatures,"© 2022 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Translucent zirconia materials were developed as an alternative to lithium disilicate materials. However, the effect of sintering temperature and artificial aging on the translucency of zirconia materials is unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the translucency of recently developed zirconia materials after different sintering temperatures and the effect of artificial aging. Material and methods: Disk-shaped specimens (Ø15×1 mm) of 3 different monolithic zirconias (Katana UTML, Prettau Anterior, VITA YZ XT) and a control lithium disilicate reinforced glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD LT) were evaluated. The zirconia specimens were divided into 2 subgroups with different sintering temperatures (1450 °C, 1550 °C) (n=5, N=35). The specimens were artificially aged in a thermocycle tester and a mastication simulator. The translucency parameter (TP) was calculated by measuring with a spectrophotometer. Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to analyze the data (α=.05). Results: While the overall TP of monolithic zirconia increased after artificial aging, the lithium disilicate specimens did not show a statistically significant difference (P=.35). The Prettau Anterior and VITA YZ XT specimens had a statistically significant higher TP than Katana UTML (P=.009). Sintering temperature did not have a statistically significant effect on the TP value of monolithic zirconia materials (P>.05). Conclusions: Artificial aging increased the TP, and the sintering temperature did not affect the TP of monolithic zirconia. The use of fully stabilized zirconia may be an alternative to lithium disilicate in esthetic restorations in clinical practice.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1016/j.optmat.2022.112485
A data-driven approach to full-field nonlinear stress distribution and failure pattern prediction in composites using deep learning,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.An image-based deep learning framework is developed to predict nonlinear stress distribution and failure pattern in microstructural representations of composite materials in this paper. The work is motivated by the complexity and computational cost of high-fidelity simulations of such materials. The proposed deep learning framework predicts the post-failure full-field stress distribution and the crack pattern in two-dimensional representations of the composites based on their microstructures. The deep learning framework contains two stacked fully-convolutional networks, namely, Generator 1 and Generator 2, trained sequentially. First, Generator 1 learns to translate the microstructural geometry to the full-field post-failure stress distribution. Then, Generator 2 learns to translate the output of Generator 1 to the failure pattern. A physics-informed loss function is also designed and incorporated to further improve the performance of the proposed framework and facilitate the validation process. The material of interest is selected to be a unidirectional carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composite. 4500 microstructural representations are synthetically generated and simulated using an efficient finite element framework to provide a sufficiently large data set for training and validating the deep learning framework. It is shown that the proposed deep learning approach can predict the composites’ post-failure full-field stress distribution and failure pattern, two of the most complex phenomena to simulate in computational solid mechanics, with an impressive accuracy of 90%.",Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering,10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2022.106911
SiO2–GeO2 Glass–Ceramic Flakes as an Anode Material for High-Performance Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The preparation of a flake-like glass–ceramic anode material comprised of SiO2 and GeO2 for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) is demonstrated. The precursor glass material is prepared via a traditional melt quenching technique. Flake-like glass particles are obtained by compression in the liquid phase via ball milling. A subsequent heat treatment induces crystallization of GexSiyO6 domains inside the vitreous SiO2–GeO2 matrix. This novel glass-ceramic material is applied as an anode material for LIBs and shows a stable reversible capacity of 520 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C combined with good capacity retention of 87% after 100 cycles. This cycling stability can be attributed to the synergistic effects of having nanocrystalline domains embedded in the glass matrix: The open glass network can withstand the volume change and stress caused by the lithium insertion during cycling, while the nanocrystals act as active sites for the electrochemical conversion and alloying reactions. The glass–ceramic anode material exhibits superior electrochemical properties compared to its pure glass counterparts.",Energy Technology,10.21608/EJCHEM.2021.104384.4818
Thermochromic properties of composite materials made from polylactic acid reinforced with recovered liquid crystals from waste LCD/LED laptops screens,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The use of flat panel displays has permeated daily life since the breakthrough in the usage of liquid crystals (LCs) in display technology. However, the presence of chemical compositions such us cyano-groups, benzene, fluorine, cyclohexyl, etc., in LCs has potential adverse effects on humans and their environment as well. The environmental issue can be resolved by recovering the LCs for use in different applications. In this study, solvent extraction recovery process was directly used to simultaneously recover and purify LCs from waste liquid crystal display (LCD)/light emitting diode (LED) screens of laptops. The physicochemical (Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)) and morphological properties (scanning electron microscopy (SEM)) of the purified and unpurified recovered liquid crystals (RLCs) were compared. The RLCs were incorporated in polylactic acid (PLA) using 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 wt% of RLC. Thermochromic properties of the formulated PLA-RLC composites were studied from room temperature (25 °C) to 100 °C using a colorimeter. The changes in colour with change in temperature were measured and recorded. A recovery rate of 92.46% LCs was obtained from the laptop screens, making the purification process very effective as ascertained by the physicochemical characterization techniques. The difference in crystallinity of the purified and unpurified RLCs was 2.55% with the solid to liquid crystalline transition temperatures of the purified and unpurified RLCs being 45 °C and 65 °C, respectively. The thermochromic studies of the formulated PLA-RLC composites showed an appreciable colour change with temperature improvements in all the colour variables (i.e., the lightness, a* and b*). The colour changes were however not visible to the eyes due to the small energy difference (ΔE*) values. The implication of the results is that the RLC from waste screens of LCDs/LEDs exhibits enhanced thermochromic properties when different purification stages are used.",Optical Materials,10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.04.020
Influence of graphene nanopowder impurities on the structural and optical properties of sodium borate copper-based glass: Towards UV/NIR shielding materials,"© 2022 Elsevier Masson SASGraphene nanopowder was used as an unconventional additive to the studied oxide glasses, where it was added to the raw components of the copper-sodium borate glass by weight% according to the chemical formula: [(B2O3)0.6mol%(Na2O)0.3mol%(Cu2O3)0.2mol%]+(Graphene)x, where x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 1 g. Then, the traditional melt quenching method was considered for the glass preparation process. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), Ultraviolet–Visible spectra UV–Vis, and the electron spin resonance (ESR) were used for the characterization processes. According to the XRD patterns, the prepared samples have been divided into two categories, pure glassy samples (x < 0.6 g), and glass-ceramic samples (x ≥ 0.6 g). The FTIR showed the presence of the structural groups BO3 and BO4 as well C[dbnd]O. Also, FTIR showed a conversion from BO3 to BO4 when the content of graphene increased, which means a decrease in the number of nonbridging oxygen atoms NBOs. The deconvolution parameters showed an increase in the relative area of the band assigned to the OH and CH2 groups. According to ESR spectral analysis, Cu2+ ions should occupy octahedral sites with tetragonal distortion as the ground state, where the effective g values and the peak-to-peak width were computed and linked with the structural variation of the prepared samples. The UV–Vis optical measurements showed that the as-prepared glasses/glass-ceramics could act as an optical pass filter in the region of the visible light, as well as good candidates for UV- and NIR shielding applications.",Solid State Sciences,10.1007/s10971-022-05842-9

Quantitative analysis of color accuracy and bias in 4 dental CAD-CAM monolithic restorative materials with different thicknesses: An in vitro study,"© 2022 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) monolithic restorative materials have become a popular option because of advantages such as convenience and efficiency. However, studies that quantitatively analyzed their color accuracy and bias are lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the color accuracy and bias of 4 CAD-CAM monolithic restorative materials with different thicknesses by using the CIELab color space. Material and methods: Four types of dental CAD-CAM monolithic restorative materials in shade A2, lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD), infiltrated ceramic (VITA Enamic), resin-nano ceramic (LAVA Ultimate), and polymethyl methacrylate (Telio CAD), were prepared as 12×12-mm specimens of 10 different thicknesses (from 0.5 to 5.0 mm) (N=200, n=5). After polishing with SiC P1500-grit, CIELab color coordinate parameters of the specimens were measured with a spectrophotometer (VITA Easyshade V). The color accuracy and bias were described by ΔE00, ΔL∗, Δa∗, and Δb∗ in the CIELab color space, and the data were analyzed by using a 2-way ANOVA, post hoc Tukey-Kramer test, and the t test (α=.05). Results: The ΔE00, ΔL∗, Δa∗, and Δb∗ were significantly influenced by material type and thickness (P<.001). Specimens at a thickness of 0.5 mm represented the maximum ΔE00. The minimum ΔE00 was observed at a thickness of 2.0 mm for LAVA Ultimate, 1.5 mm for VITA Enamic and Telio CAD, and 4.0 mm for IPS e.max CAD. The ΔE00 of all specimens significantly exceeded the 50:50% acceptability threshold (1.8 unit) (P<.001). LU exhibited higher ΔE00, Δa∗, and Δb∗ than the other 3 materials in all thickness expect for 0.5 mm. For color bias, the ΔE00 was more influenced by Δb∗ and ΔL∗ than Δa∗. Conclusions: The color accuracy and bias were significantly affected by material type and thickness. The color inaccuracy of the tested materials was statistically significant and clinically perceptible. Improved clinical outcomes may be expected from the 1.5-mm- to 2.0-mm-thick restorations.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1016/j.addma.2022.102844
Bone formation with high bacterial inhibition and low toxicity behavior by melding of Al2O3 on nanobioactive glass ceramics via sol-gel process,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Bioactive glasses have been popular as coating materials on bone implants in recent years to increase their integration with the host tissue and overall biological function. Infection and toxicity are significant factors in the failure of bone-implant material. The goal of this research is to develop a sol-gel derived, Al2O3 doped nanobioactive glass-ceramics (nBGC) with non-toxic and antibacterial activity. The main crystalline phase of sodium calcium silicate was transformed to sodium calcium aluminium silicate by increasing the Al2O3 concentration, it was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis. The density and mechanical strength were increased as 2.63–3.12 g/cm3 and 75–105 MPa, respectively for the sample x = 0 to 10 wt.%. The formation of hydroxyapatite (HAp) was proved by XRD, FTIR, and FESEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope) with EDS (Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy) analysis through variations in pH, zeta potential, and degradation behavior. Higher cell viability percentage was attained as >99% for L929 cells, outstanding antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus and excellent hydrophilic nature were obtained for the sample nBGC-10Al.

The Effect of Be Co-Doping on Luminescence Properties of Gd3Al3Ga2O12:Ce Glass Ceramics,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The glass-ceramics (GC) of gadolinium aluminum gallium garnets with the expected composition of Gd3Al3Ga2O12:Ce and Gd3Al3Ga2O12:Ce,Be (GAGG:Ce and GAGG:Ce,Be, respectively) are fabricated by crystallization from the Gd2O3–Al2O3–Ga2O3–CeO2–SiO2–BeO (Gd:Ga:Al ratio is close to 3:2:3) glasses. The influence of Be2+ co-doping (including doping level) on the luminescent properties of the GAGG is demonstrated. In particular, Be co-doping results in the suppression of the Ce3+-related radioluminescence (RL) and as a consequence, the light yield is lowered as well. The conclusion is made that Be2+ creates effective electron or hole trapping centers.",Physica Status Solidi (A) Applications and Materials Science,10.1007/s11664-022-09694-5

The dielectric properties, relative permittivity (εr), quality factor (Q×f) and dielectric loss (tanδ) were measured as a function of ceramic solid loading (%) at 5 GHz for 3D printed samples. A relative permittivity εr = 6.05, Q×f = 10,433 GHz and dielectric loss tanδ = 0.007 were obtained for a BST/ABS ceramic polymer composite, with 50 wt% (15 vol%) solid loading. The composite materials exhibit reduced dielectric losses compared to standard laminates currently used in the radiofrequency (RF) and telecommunications industry. Based on polymer/ceramic composite filament, a prototype microstrip patch 5 G antenna and a hemispherical dielectric lens were designed and manufactured. Through testing, it shows good antenna performance with a centre frequency of f0 = 3.78 GHz and a (−10 dB) bandwidth of 90.6 MHz.

The Transformation from Translucent into Transparent Rare Earth Ions Doped Oxyfluoride Glass-Ceramics with Enhanced Luminescence,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Optical Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.It is known that the optical transparency of an oxide glass decreases with an increase in the size and fraction of crystals in the glass during heat-treatment. Here, the authors report an opposite scenario, where a translucent Er3+−Yb3+ doped oxyfluoride precursor glass-ceramic (P-GC) becomes transparent with increasing crystal size and crystallinity. Specifically, in the heat-treated P-GC samples, the authors observe that the growth of the existing Ba2LaF7 crystals and particularly the formation of small spherical Ba2LaF7 crystals greatly enhanced the light transmittance. To reveal the origin of this anomalous phenomenon, the authors perform detailed morphology and structure analyses on both P-GC and the heat-treated P-GC samples and molecular dynamics simulations of the precursor glass. The results show that the composition of the residual glass phase is altered (e.g., depletion of La3+) in the way that the differences in refractive index between the glass matrix and the crystals are greatly reduced. As a consequence, the light scattering of the heat-treated P-GC is suppressed, and hence, the derived P-GC becomes transparent. In addition, a proper heat-treatment can also enhance the luminescence of the studied P-GC system.",Advanced Optical Materials,10.21608/ejchem.2021.99125.4612

"Synthesis, Processing and the Effect of Thermal Treatment on the Solubility, Antioxidant Potential and Cytocompatibility of Y2O3 and CeO2 doped SiO2-SrO-Na2O Glass-Ceramics","© The Author(s) 2022.Thermal treatment of a 0.52SiO2-0.24SrO-0.24-xNa2O-xMO glass-ceramic series (where x = 0.08 and MO = Y2O3 or CeO2) was conducted in order to synthesize yttrium (Y3+) and cerium (Ce3+) crystalline species that may act as radical oxygen specie (ROS) scavengers. The prominent phase for the Control is a sodium-strontium-silicate while the experimental glass-ceramics (HY, YCe, and HCe) present sodium-Y/Ce-silicate and oxide phases. Disk shrinkage during thermal processing ranges from 1–7% for Control, HY, YCe, and HCe in both diameter and thickness. Solubility studies determined that the release of Si4+ and Na+ are greatest from the Control disks which peaks at 1550 µg/mL. Release from the Y3+ and Ce3+ glass-ceramics reached 320 µg/mL for Si4+ and 630 µg/mL for Na+. The range of antioxidant capacity (ABTS assay) for all samples was 0.31–3.9 mMTE.

Effect of Ag-doping on the thermal features of hydroxyapatite,"© 2022 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)A series of Ag-doped hydroxyapatite (Ag-HA) of the general molecular formula (Ca10-xAgx (PO4)6(OH)2), where x = 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 mole had been prepared by a solution technique. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), Electron diffraction (EDP) and Scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) were used for assigning the presence of glass-ceramic, crystalline, and polycrystalline phases. Addition of low content of silver to the HA leads to the formation of beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) and Ag-HA. The spectral changes were directly dependent on Ag concentration, time, and heat treatment temperature. The results revealed the occurrence of different functional groups of HA and β-TCP in the matrices of the glass-ceramic. The role of the nucleating agent Ag was critically assigned and the presence of the characteristic phases of HA and β-TCP was confirmed and properly assigned and addressed. TEM and SEM were used to properly assign the morphology of the formed phases. Ag-HA prepared with β-TCP components can be used as unique bio-ceramic materials in different biological applications.",Egyptian Journal of Chemistry,10.1016/j.jlumin.2022.118907
Effect of ark clam shell on crystal growth and mechanical evaluation of foam glass-ceramic derived from cullet glass waste,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The solid-state sintering technique was used to successfully manufacture low-cost foam glass-ceramic utilising ark clamshell and cullet glass waste. The foam glass-ceramic has a composition of xACS-(100-x)SLS, where x = 1, 3, 6, and 9 wt%, and is classified as FGC1, FGC2, FGC3, and FGC4 as the ark clamshell content increases. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) findings reveal that when the ark clamshell composition increases, two main crystals with the appearance of C–O and Ca–O–Si bands grow as wollastonite (CaSiO3) and cristobalite (SiO2) phases. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) micrograph was used to confirm the porosity microstructure of the foam glass-ceramic aggregates. The sample with the greatest expansion (83.98%) yielded the lowest apparent density (0.699 g/cm3). The compressive strength measurement of the foam glass-ceramic aggregates was measured using GCF2 with 3 wt% of ACS. For a sample containing 3 wt% ACS, the maximum compressive strength value was 1.14 MPa, with an average total porosity of about 58.34%, and it has the potential to be employed in the construction sector.",Materials Science and Engineering B: Solid-State Materials for Advanced Technology,10.1002/adfm.202201528
"Synthesis and ionic conductivity of Li boracites, Li4B7O12Cl and Li4B4Al3O12Cl1-xBrx","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Li4B7O12Cl, Li4B4Al3O12Cl, and new boracite, Li4B4Al3O12Cl1-xBrx (x = 0.1, 0.2 and 1.0) were synthesized using solid-state reaction method. The crystal structures of Li4B7O12Cl and Li4B4Al3O12Cl were investigated through high-intensity synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) analysis. The ionic conductivity was elucidated for the ceramics and green compacts to discuss their potential as a solid electrolyte of all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. The ionic conductivity of the bulk part was 2.0 × 10−5 S/cm for Li4B4Al3O12Cl0.2Br0.1 and Li4B4Al3O12Cl0.8Br0.2 at 294 K and the total ionic conductivity of these compounds was approximately 10−8 S/cm. Furthermore, we succeeded to prepare a high-density green compact for Li4B7O12Cl. The total ionic conductivity of this sample was higher than that of Li4B7O12Cl glass-ceramics at high temperatures. The conduction pathway was determined by bond valence sum mapping for Li4B7O12Cl and Li4B4Al3O12Cl, which was conducted based on the refined structural data of the high-intensity SXRD data. The results showed that an additional conduction pathway is formed for Li4B4Al3O12Cl and its larger unit cell promotes Li+ migration around the halogen ion. Although the substitution of Cl− with Br− suppresses the migration of Li+ around halogen ion due to the large ionic radius of Br− in Li4B4Al3O12Cl1-xBrx, appropriate substitution enhances ion migration via the additional pathway without suppressing the ion transfer around the halogen ion. Thus, Li4B4Al3O12Cl0.2Br0.1 and Li4B4Al3O12Cl0.8Br0.2 showed high ionic conductivity.",Solid State Ionics,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105224
Efficient and broadband near-infrared emission of Cr3+-doped glass-ceramics for near-infrared light sources applications,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The high-efficiency and broadband near-infrared (NIR)-emitting materials play a vital role in NIR spectroscopy techniques. Herein, a series of Cr3+-doped magnesium aluminosilicate glasses were successfully prepared, and the Mg2Al4Si5O18 and MgAl2O4 nanocrystals were mainly precipitated in glass-ceramics after heat treatment. In addition, the results indicated that Cr3+ ions were in octahedral sites in the dual-phase glass-ceramics. Under the excitation of 400 nm and 465 nm xenon lamp, a broadband emission peak located at ∼985 nm was reported, which was caused by the overlap of the peaks centered at ∼965 nm and ∼1010 nm, and the controllable emission was achieved by selective enrichment of Cr3+ ions into Mg2Al4Si5O18 and MgAl2O4 nanocrystals in dual-phase glass-ceramics. This study demonstrates that dual-phase glass-ceramics have a potential application in NIR spectroscopy techniques, and more importantly, provides a key strategy for preparing high-efficiency and broadband NIR-emitting materials.",Journal of Luminescence,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.180
Design Unique Air-Stable and Li–Metal Compatible Sulfide Electrolyte via Exploration of Anion Functional Units for All-Solid-State Lithium–Metal Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The marriage of solid-state sulfide electrolytes (SSSEs) with Li-anode and oxide-based cathodes can multiply the energy density of all-solid-state Lithium–metal batteries (ASSLMBs). However, hydrolysis in the air, reduction at the Li/SSSE interface, and growth of Li-dendrites inside SSSEs collectively block the route of sulfide-based ASSLMBs. Herein, a novel Li2.96P0.98S3.92O0.06-Li3N glass–ceramic electrolyte (GCE) is developed, wherein O and N substitution produce POS33– and Li3N unique functional units enable superior σLi+ 1.58 mS cm–1 at RT. Notably, POS33– units in Li2.96P0.98S3.92O0.06-Li3N excellently prevent the structural degradation against moisture @45–50%. The critical current density of Li2.96P0.98S3.92O0.06–Li3N reaches 1 mA cm–2/1 mAh cm–2 @ RT. Moreover, Li//Li cells realize unprecedented Li-plating/stripping >1000 h at 0.3 mA cm–2/0.3 mAh cm–2 and 0.5 mA cm–2/0.5 mAh cm–2 at RT. ToF-SIMS and depth-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirm the formation of Pre-solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) enriched with thermodynamically stable Li2O and Li3N species at Li/Li2.96P0.98S3.92O0.06–Li3N interface, suppressing the interfacial reactions and growth of Li-dendrites inside Li2.96P0.98S3.92O0.06–Li3N.

Soft machining-induced surface and edge chipping damage in pre-crystalized lithium silicate glass ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSoft machining is a key procedure in fabrication of high-strength lithium-based silicate glass ceramic (LS) restorations. This paper reports on the diamond machining-induced surface and edge chipping damage in two pre-crystalized LS materials: pre-crystallized lithium metasilicate/orthophosphate glass ceramic (Pre-LS, IPS e.max CAD) and pre-crystallized zirconia-containing lithium metasilicate glass ceramic (Pre-ZLS, Vita Suprinity). Indentation techniques were used to measure the material mechanical properties. Soft machining was conducted using a robotic controlled apparatus mimicking dental CAD/CAM machining processes at different removal rates and enabling in-process force measurement. Machined surface roughness was assessed using 3D confocal optical profilometry in terms of the average and maximum surface heights. Scanning electron microscopy was used to assess diamond tool and machined surface and edge morphology. Soft machining of both materials was dominated by brittle fracture mixed with localized ductile flow. However, the higher brittleness index of Pre-ZLS than Pre-LS yielded higher degrees of machining-induced conchoidal fractures in Pre-ZLS in comparison with irregular fractures in Pre-LS. Thus, much larger surface roughness and deeper edge chipping damage were produced in Pre-ZLS than Pre-LS. Machining forces for Pre-ZLS were significantly smaller than Pre-LS, due to the lower machinability index associated with a complex relation of the mechanical properties as well as less debris adhesion for Pre-ZLS than Pre-LS. Further, increased material removal rates resulted in significantly increased machining forces, maximum surface roughness and fracture, and edge chipping damage in both Pre-ZLS and Pre-LS materials. Therefore, optimization of soft machining processes needs to be practiced to achieve accepted surface and edge quality at balanced removal rates.",Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1111/jace.18447
Design and technological aspects of novel CdS quantum dots doped glass–ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The poor thermal stability of current commercial white light emitting diodes (LED) fabricated using a blue chip, a yellow phosphor based on Ce-doped yttrium and lutetium aluminum garnets, red nitride phosphor and resins, restricts their application in fields where long service time and high power lighting systems are required. Incorporating garnet-based phosphors into a glass offers a possible way to remove the organic resins in LED encapsulation. In the present study, a glass-ceramics based on a sodium silicate glass matrix and cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS QDs) was prepared using a simple sintering technique. The technological aspects of glass-ceramics preparation and their influence on the luminescent and lighting characteristics of the material was described. At once, a glass with CdS QDs performs the functions of both a matrix and a phosphor emitting in the yellow and red spectral regions. The variation of the excitation energy allows to switch the ratio of the excited ceramic components that affects the spectral composition of luminescence. The synthesis conditions varied the quantum yield of luminescence in the wide range from 9.4 to 40.8%, the correlated color temperature from 3622 to 6742 K, and the color rendering index from 60.0 to 96.8. The leading sample of glass-ceramics under blue light irradiation had the chromaticity coordinates nearly in the ideal white light region (0.3310, 0.3733). The obtained glass-ceramics might be used as effective luminescent material for the manufacture of white emitters.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.149
Emerging Research in Conductive Materials for Fused Filament Fabrication: A Critical Review,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Engineering Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.The progress of Industry 4.0 and the advancement of robotic design are revealing a significant gap in the capabilities of current manufacturing techniques and the selection of materials that are available in electronics. Present-day electrical systems largely rely on metals, but there is a driving need to develop new electrically conductive objects with a wide range of material properties, including expanded flexibility and softness, and with increasingly complex geometries. Electrically conductive composites can replace traditional metal-based systems. In particular, thermoplastic composites become electrically conductive with the incorporation of conductive fillers or polymers while retaining to a large extent the processability of the thermoplastic matrix. This is where fused filament fabrication (FFF), an additive manufacturing (AM) technique capable of processing a variety of thermoplastic-matrix feedstock materials, can be leveraged to create electrically conductive objects with new functionalities. While there is an increasing number of publications describing the FFF of electrical objects such as sensors and circuits, there is no comprehensive review outlining the functioning mechanisms, drawbacks, and advantages of FFF as applied to conductive materials. The present review fills this lacuna by offering a critical analysis of the specific challenges and solutions to promote FFF of electrically conductive polymers and composites.",Advanced Engineering Materials,10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2022.103138
Self-reduction and enhanced luminescence in transparent Mn2+-doped mullite glass-ceramics derived from EMT-type zeolite,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.Mn2+ activated glass-ceramic (GC) has received tremendous attention in the exploration of luminescent materials for solid-state lighting due to the high stability, broad red emission, and low toxicity. However, the doped Mn2+ ions still suffer from the oxidation and uncontrollable ions migration during the melting process of conventional preparation techniques, which is detrimental to the luminescence performance. Herein, transparent Mn2+-doped mullite GCs have been prepared at low temperature (∼850°C) via the spark plasma sintering of EMT-type zeolite. The GC samples show typical red emission peaking at 620 nm that can be assigned to spin-forbidden 4T1(G)→6A1(S) transition of Mn2+ located in the octahedral coordination site of the host. Owing to the charge compensation mechanism and produced oxygen vacancies, the self-reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+ ions is realized and the oxidization is inhibited. The mullite nanocrystals acted as additional scattering centers introduce Rayleigh scattering to enhance the emission intensity. Moreover, benefitted from the established mullite nanocrystals network, the Mn2+-doped GCs exhibit improved thermal conductivity up to 1.79 W K−1 m−1 and more excellent mechanical properties than conventional GCs, simultaneously.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jmat.2022.03.001
A glass-ceramic approach to prepare porous TiO2 with self-supported nano-flakes: The phase evolution and the thermal stability of the product,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.A porous TiO2 material consisting of self-supported nano-flakes with mixed anatase/rutile phases was prepared by acid-etching of a glass-ceramic derived from 20MgO•24CuO•32TiO2•24P2O5 phosphate glass frit. The analysis showed that selective dissolution of components of CuO, Mg3(PO4)2, MgTi4(PO4)6 in the crystallized sample first occurred, followed by the growth of TiO2 nano-flakes and the formation of Ti(HPO4)2•2H2O phase due to the supply of Ti4+ and [PO4]3- released form the dissolved crystallites. The sample acid-treated for 17 h had the best crystallization of anatase and rutile phases, and the smallest band gap. In addition, the porous skeleton showed excellent thermal stability and a large surface area. The present study provided a new method which could be used for the scale-up production of porous TiO2.",Ceramics International,10.1007/s12666-022-02532-6
Effect of the composition and manufacturing process on the resin microtensile bond strength to ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe present study aimed to investigate the bond strength between resin cement and different glass-ceramics manufactured in different processing systems using two different microtensile bond strength test (μTBs) assemblies (ceramic-ceramic or ceramic-dentin). For this, ceramic blocks were fabricated with adhesive surface area of 5 × 5 mm to test the different possibilities combining the two different glass-ceramic compositions (feldspathic – FEL and lithium disilicate - LD), the three manufacturing-processes (CAD/CAM, heat-pressed or layered for FEL; CAD/CAM or heat-pressed for LD) and the two μTBS assemblies (ceramic-ceramic or ceramic-dentin). Half of the samples of each ceramic evaluated were made by cementing the ceramic blocks in another ceramic block and the other half by cementing the ceramic blocks in ground molars with exposed dentin, using resin cement (Rely X ARC, 3 M ESPE). The samples were stored for 24 h in distilled water at 37 °C and then sectioned into microbars (±1 mm2, n = 30). These specimens were submitted to the μTBS and the data were analyzed by specific statistical tests (α = 0.05). The fractured surfaces were examined under a stereomicroscope and the failure mode was classified. In addition, finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to observe the maximum tensile stress in the resin cement when a μTBS load was applied (10 N) and during the resin cement polymerization shrinkage. The CAD/CAM glass-ceramics have better bond strength than the other evaluated manufacturing processes, the LD groups had higher μTBS values than the FEL groups in ceramic-ceramic assembly; dentin as a substrate (ceramic-dentin assembly) had a negative influence on the results for all evaluated materials. Regarding the FEA results, the maximum tensile stress in ceramic-ceramic groups was 16.1–16.5 MPa (when 10 N load was simulated), and 50.8–51.2 MPa (during the resin cement polymerization shrinkage). For the ceramic-dentin groups, the maximum tensile stress was 16.9 and 17.1 MPa on the ceramic side and 17.6 and 17.8 MPa on the dentin side (10 N load simulation); 49.8 and 49.4 MPa on the ceramic side and 49.7 and 49.4 MPa on the dentin side (resin cement polymerization shrinkage). Different glass-ceramic compositions and manufacturing processes induced distinct bond strength values (LD had better results). Moreover, the μTBS assembly interferes with the results obtained, having the ceramic-ceramic set-up inducing higher bond results than the ceramic-dentin arrangement.",International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.124
Excellent energy storage performance of niobate-based glass-ceramics via introduction of nucleating agent,"© 2022 The Chinese Ceramic SocietyFor glass-ceramics, how to realize the collaborative optimization of BDS and permittivity is the key to improve the energy storage density. In this work, ZrO2 is introduced into BPKNAS glass-ceramics as nucleating agent to promote crystal development of glass-ceramics and then achieve high permittivity. When 1.5 mol% ZrO2 is added, the glass-ceramics have the highest permittivity (∼128.59) and meanwhile possess high BDS (1948.90 kV/cm) due to the dense microstructure. Therefore, BPKNAS-1.5ZrO2 glass-ceramics has the highest theoretical energy storage density (21.62 J/cm3). Moreover, the permittivity variation of BPKNAS-1.5ZrO2 glass-ceramics is less than 6 % in the wide temperature range from −80 to 300 °C, showing excellent temperature stability. In addition, BPKNAS-1.5ZrO2 glass-ceramics possesses ultrahigh power density, which reaches up to 382.40 MW/cm3 in overdamped circuit. The above evidence shows that BPKNAS-1.5ZrO2 glass-ceramics with ultrahigh energy storage density and power density is very competitive in the field of energy storage applications.",Journal of Materiomics,10.1007/s00784-022-04445-6
Leaching Performance of Glass–Ceramic Prepared from High-Carbon Ferrochromium Slag and Its Application in the Urban Constructions,"© 2022, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.Ferrochromium (FeCr) slag-based glass–ceramic was successfully prepared in laboratory, and subsequently tested by different kinds of leaching experiment. Firstly, the ordinary toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) test, and long-term leaching experiment (140 days) were carried out, and lastly, the samples were tested under different extreme application conditions, which are, high-speed stirring (high mechanical strength), and strong alkali or acid environment, to obtain the condition that the leaching concentration of the chromium (Cr) in the samples exceeds its standard. The result shows that the concentration of Cr increases with the increase of the stirring speed, and when the stirring speed reaches 2000 rpm, the Cr concentration reaches its maximum of 0.396 mg/L. When the pH value changes from 0 to 14, the Cr concentration decreases sharply in the beginning, then increases slightly, and the maximum of the concentration is 0.413 mg/L. The results indicated that, whether under the ordinary TCLP test or the extreme leaching conditions, the leaching concentrations of Cr in the glass–ceramic are all far below the international standard for solid toxic leaching concentration of Cr, and the glass–ceramic completely meets the requirements of daily and extreme practical application. Finally, the FeCr slag-based glass–ceramic with different colors were designed and adopted in different area of city, which shows a great application of it in the urban construction.",Transactions of the Indian Institute of Metals,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.03.004
Effect of ZrO2 addition on in-vitro bioactivity and mechanical properties of SiO2–Na2O–CaO–P2O5 bioactive glass-ceramic,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Herein, a multicomponent bioactive glass (0Z, 46SiO2–30CaO–18Na2O–6P2O5, wt.%) is prepared via melting. ZrO2 is introduced into the bioglass using two different methods, and then three types of glass-ceramic bulks are manufactured using low-cost pressureless sintering. The effect of ZrO2 addition on the bioactivity and mechanical properties of the bioactive glass-ceramic is assessed. The results indicate that the main crystalline precipitate from the bioactive glass-ceramic is Na2Ca(Si2O6). The crystallisation ability of the 5Z glass-ceramic, bioactive glass-ceramic with ZrO2 added during melting at high temperature, is reduced because ZrO2 participated in the reconstruction of the glass network. Further, the ZrO2 addition led to a low rate of cation release when soaked in simulated body fluid, indicating a decreased bioactivity. At the same time, the 5Y bioactive glass-ceramic, prepared by mixing YSZ particles with 0Z using ball-milling, possesses not only the highest mechanical strength (about twice the strength of 0Z) but also a high bioactivity. This study presents a promising method for the production of excellent bioactive glass-ceramic and a candidate (5Y) for the clinical applications where load bearing is required.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.03.008
Remineralization of caries-affected dentin and color stability of teeth restored after treatment with silver diamine fluoride and bioactive glass–ceramic,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the microhardness of caries-affected dentin and color stability of teeth restored after treatments with silver diamine fluoride (SDF) associated to potassium iodide (KI) and Biosilicate. Material and methods: Different samples from bovine teeth were obtained. For color readings, 80 cavities (6 mm × 6 mm × 2 mm) were prepared, and for microhardness, teeth were flattened into dentine to obtain 40 samples. All samples were submitted to cariogenic challenge and separated in 4 groups, according to the treatment used: 12% SDF + KI; 38% SDF; Biosilicate and control (no treatment). Cavities were restored with resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RMGIC, Vitremer, 3 M ESPE) or composite resin (CR, Z350, 3 M ESPE). After restoration, the samples were submitted to thermo-mechanical cycling (TMC) for 1,200,000 cycles. Color readings (EasyShade, Vita) were performed after restorations, after TMC, and 30 days after TMC. Knoop microhardness was evaluated on the planned samples before and after cariogenic challenge, after treatments, and after 30 days. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evaluated the dentine surface after treatments. Data were analyzed (ANOVA, Bonferroni, p <.05). Results: The results showed a higher color alteration for RMGIC than CR. The time of analysis was significant (p <.05) for the 12% SDF + KI and control group. There was no difference (p <.05) in microhardness between groups. However, there was evidence of dentin remineralization after treatments. Conclusions: It was concluded that the samples treated with Biosilicate resulted in a color alteration similar to control. The treatments presented dentin remineralizing potential for microhardness, below the demineralization level, caused by the cariogenic challenge. Clinical relevance: Considering the remineralizing potential presented by Biosilicate, this agent is a promising alternative that overcomes the SDF adverse effects such as tooth staining.",Clinical Oral Investigations,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.02.051
Microstructure and ion-exchange properties of transparent glass-ceramics containing Zn2TiO4/α-Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdTransparent glass-ceramics have particular properties compared with their precursor glasses, and have promising potential applications in many fields. Titanium-relative phases are frequently employed as nucleation agents for crystallization of glass-ceramics, and rarely been precipitated as functional nanocrystalline phases in glass-ceramics. In this work, transparent glass-ceramics containing Zn2TiO4 and/or α-Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals are investigated. It turns out that Vickers hardness of these glass-ceramics increases with the precipitation of Zn2TiO4 and α-Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals. Despite the blocking effect of nanocrystals precipitated in the glass-ceramics, structural and compositional modification of the residual glass induced by the precipitation of these nanocrystalline phases facilitates the K-Na ion-exchange, leading to the enhanced depth of layer and further improved Vickers hardness of the glass-ceramics.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.02.012
Engineering the crystallization behavior of CsPbBr3 quantum dots in borosilicate glass through modulating the glass network modifiers for wide-color-gamut displays,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe in-situ growth of CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs) inside glass has been regarded as an alternative approach to improve their stability. Alkaline-earth metal oxides has multiple effects on the structure of the glass network. Herein, four types of alkaline-earth metal oxides are introduced into borosilicate glasses to modulate glass network structure, which has quite different effects on the crystallization behavior of CsPbBr3 QDs. The reason can be ascribed to the different impacts of alkaline-earth metal on phase separation, nucleation, and growth procedure. Moreover, CsPbBr3 QDs embedded in glass (CsPbBr3 QD@glass) exhibit superior thermostability and photostability compared with CsPbBr3 QDs powder. Finally, a white light-emitting diode achieving 124% of National Television System Committee (NTSC) gamut is fabricated using the CsPbBr3 QD@glass, K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor film, and blue chip-on-board.

Bioactivity and biodegradability of high temperature sintered 58S ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdBioactive glasses are often considered in bone tissue engineering applications where mechanical strength is essential. As such, bioactive glass scaffolds are often sintered to improve mechanical strength. However, sintering can lead to crystallization, which reduces bioactivity and biodegradability. It has generally been considered that amorphous biomaterials exhibit better bioactivity. However, the in-vitro bioactivity and biodegradability of the sintered 58S made from initial amorphous powder and partially crystalline powder with the same chemical compositions (60SiO2-36CaO-4P2O5 (mol%)) have not been compared before. In this study, 58S bioactive glass (fully amorphous) and glass-ceramic (partially crystallized) powders were synthesized using the sol-gel process, followed by heat-treating at 600 °C for 3 h (calcination). The powders were mixed with carboxymethyl cellulose solution as a binder, shaped in a cylindrical mold, dried, and then sintered at 1100 °C for 5 h. The in-vitro bioactivity and biodegradability of the sintered samples were assessed in simulated body fluid (SBF) for times up to 28 days. The specimens were investigated before and after immersion in SBF using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The In-vitro bioactivity and biodegradability rate of the sintered 58S produced from the glass ceramic powder were higher than that from fully amorphous powder. This study shows that the initial structure after calcination is important and affects the subsequent crystallization during sintering. Therefore, crystallinity and formation of hydroxyapatite after calcination are important controlling mechanisms that can increase the bioactivity and biodegradability rate of sintered 58S.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1111/ijag.16557
Low leakage rate of silicate glass modified with Al2O3 for solid oxide fuel cell,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe gas tightness of glass sealing materials is a big challenge for the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks operating at high temperature. Thermal, sintering, crystallization behavior and gas tightness properties of the glass-based with two different Al2O3 contents sealants are evaluated and discussed. The study showed that the sealants avoid cracks at the interface on NiO-YSZ (NiO-yttria stabilized zirconia) and SUS430 stainless steel interconnect substrates. The Al2O3 embedded in the glass matrix as a second phase, and promoted crystallization of K[AlSi3O8] at the early stage. This may because some ultrafine Al2O3 particles whose structure is destroyed by prolonged high temperature treatment according XRD and TEM analysis. Especially, the sealant containing 5 wt% Al2O3 undergoes a thermal cycle and maintains a stable leakage rate below 10−4 sccm∙cm−1 for about 1000 h at 750 °C. The above results prove the possibility of using the Al2O3-doped sealing glass for SOFC stacks.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1111/jopr.13438
Formation and crystal growth of needle-like rutile in glass- ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdGlass-ceramic, which has negligible dielectric loss, high mechanical strength, excellent drop resistance, low CTE, and low density for lightweight design, is the best option for the back cover of mobile devices in the 5 G era. Herein, the effect of P2O5 on the phase separation and crystallization of MgO–Al2O3–SiO2-TiO2 glass-ceramics is studied. The incorporation of P2O5 in the glass structure leads to phase separation, in which the P and Mg-enriched phase was formed in the glass matrix, and promotes the increase of Tg. With the increase of P2O5 content, the precipitated crystals change significantly. First, the silicate crystals (Mg2SiO4) disappear, whereas the phosphate crystals (LiMgPO4) emerge when 2 mol% P2O5 is introduced. Second, titanate crystal (MgTi2O5) can not be observed when 4 mol% P2O5 is introduced. The Ti5O9 crystals appear simultaneously with LiMgPO4 crystals and transform to rutile TiO2 crystals at high temperature. Interestingly, the needle-like rutile TiO2 crystals, which is 300 nm long and 20 nm wide, have been found in a glass with 4 mol% P2O5. The large L/D ratio of needle-like crystals increases the hardness significantly from 6.08 GPa to 7.14 GPa. Similar to other fiber reinforced composites, this needle-like crystals provide a new strategy to improve the mechanical properties of glass ceramics.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1007/s12633-021-01318-7
Iron-phosphate glass-ceramic anodes for lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society and Wiley Periodicals LLC.The oxide glass-based anodes for lithium-ion Batteries (LiBs) still suffer from two critical drawbacks, that is, low reversible capacity and low electrical conductivity. Here, we report a new way to overcome the two drawbacks. Specifically, we chose 50Fe2O3–50P2O5 (50Fe50P) glass as the anode material for LiBs, and then thermally treat it at 1118 K (Tg+345 K) for 0.5 h under reducing atmosphere (5 mol% H2+95 mol% Ar). The thermal reduction treatment led to formation of Fe2(P4O12) and Fe2Fe5(P2O7)4 crystals. The reduced glass-based anode for LiBs exhibits the capacity of 373 mA h g−1 after 1 000 charge/discharge cycles at 1 A g−1, which is higher than that of the oxidized one. The reduction treatment greatly lowers the charge transfer resistance in the glass anode, indicating the enhancement of the electrical conductivity. This performance improvement could arise from the increase of accessible active sites for Li+ ion storage and transfer due to the existence of crystal–crystal/crystal–glass boundaries, as well as from the improvement of the electron transfer between Fe2+ and Fe3+ during cycling. This reduction–crystallization approach could help develop high-performance oxide glass-ceramics based anodes for advanced LiBs.",International Journal of Applied Glass Science,10.1007/s12633-021-01286-y
Evaluation of Marginal and Internal Fit of a CAD/CAM Monolithic Zirconia-Reinforced Lithium Silicate Porcelain Laminate Veneer System,"© 2021 by the American College of Prosthodontists.Purpose: To evaluate the marginal and internal fit of monolithic computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) ZLS (Vita Suprinity) glass ceramic porcelain laminate veneers (PLVs), in terms of marginal and internal gap widths, in comparison to monolithic lithium disilicate (LDS) [IPS e.max CAD] CAD/CAM veneers, and, also, to analyze the effect of incisal preparation designs (butt joint and chamfer), on the marginal and internal fit accuracy. Materials and Methods: Forty dental stone dies poured from impressions made of two master metal dies with different incisal preparation designs were scanned to produce digital models. Forty ceramic veneers were designed and milled using the virtual models-10 ZLS butt joint, 10 ZLS chamfer, 10 LDS butt joint, and 10 LDS chamfer. The monolithic ceramic veneers produced were then subjected to marginal and internal gap width evaluation using X-ray nano-computed tomography and computerized digital analysis (n = 10). Descriptive analyses of data were performed and the influence of “material” and “preparation design” on the marginal and internal fit of veneers was assessed using 2-way ANOVA (α = 0.05). Bonferroni post-hoc multiple comparison tests were used to further analyze the interactions between the material and preparation design after adjusting the α value by Holm-Bonferroni method (α = 0.01). Results: Mean marginal and internal gaps for ZLS PLVs were 65 ±11 μm and 112 ±14 μm for butt joint, and 100 ±24 μm and 100 ±21 μm for chamfer, respectively. Corresponding values for LDS PLVs were 78 ±25 μm and 114 ±17 μm for butt joint, and 104 ±18 μm and 106 ±7 μm for chamfer. Marginal gap and internal gap differences between ZLS and LDS PLVs were not significant (marginal gap: F = 1.786, p = 0.190; internal gap: F = 0.807, p = 0.375). However, the preparation designs (butt joint and chamfer) differed significantly in terms of marginal gaps (F = 23.797, p = 0.000), but not internal gaps (F = 3.703; p = 0.059). Conclusions: Butt joint margins produced better marginal accuracy in terms of marginal gap, compared to chamfers, for ZLS CAD/CAM laminate veneers.",Journal of Prosthodontics,10.1016/j.prosdent.2020.11.014
Electrical and Dielectric Properties of the Natural Calcite and Quartz,"© 2021, Springer Nature B.V.Since humanity has existed, natural materials have been used in our daily lives; they have been utilized as raw materials in manufacturing from the pin to the jet. Natural calcite and quartz are used as raw materials in various applications, including agriculture, cement, chemical and pharmaceutical, glass, ceramics, and optical fiber; however, the studies on the high-temperature dependence of their electrical and dielectric properties are still scarce and limited. Herein, the electrical and dielectric properties of the natural calcite and quartz have been investigated in the temperature range of 300–1000 K at different frequencies. The electrical conductivity results revealed that natural calcite and quartz appeared to be insulators with stable behavior up to 730 and 640 K, respectively; then, they behaved as semiconductors at higher temperatures. The results revealed the conduction mechanism in both samples seems to be by the charge carriers hopping at the lower temperatures then turning into polarons conduction at the higher temperatures. Both dielectric constant and dielectric loss of the natural calcite and quartz showed temperature-dependent behavior up to 700 K at the low frequencies. Then, they showed frequency-dependent behavior at high frequencies. The stable behavior of electrical and dielectric properties of natural calcite and quartz could make them candidate materials to be used as high-voltage power insulators up to a temperature of 700 K.",Silicon,10.1016/j.prosdent.2020.12.002

Aim of the study is to learn about and comprehend the structural, thermal, and crystallization features of these glasses. The method of X-ray diffraction was originally used to check the status of manufacture samples. Molar volume was decreased while density was raised in this investigation. Fourier transform infrared investigated showed that as Y2O3 replaced by TiO2. Bridging oxygens (BOs) increment, while non-bridging oxygens (NBOs) reduce, enhancing the structural units and interconnection. Differential thermal analysis was used to examine these glasses’ thermal stability. The thermal stability enhanced as Y2O3 concentration increased. The glass-ceramic was created using controlled heat and analysed using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope. Glass-ceramic samples’ ultrasonic velocities and elastic moduli enhance as internal energy rises.

Effects of thermal and mechanical cycling on the mechanical strength and surface properties of dental CAD-CAM restorative materials,"© 2020 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: The properties of dental computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials vary. Studies regarding the effects of aging on the properties of these materials are lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the changes in the mechanical and surface properties of different CAD-CAM materials after thermocycling and mechanical loading. Material and methods: In total, 150 bar-shaped specimens (17.0×4.0×2.0 mm) were prepared from feldspathic glass-ceramic (VM; Vitablocs Mark II), lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (EX; IPS e.max CAD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic (CD; Celtra Duo), polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (VE; Vita Enamic), and resin-nanoceramic (CS; Cerasmart). Each type was divided into 2 groups (n=15; each). One group was subjected to thermocycling in distilled water at 5 °C to 55 °C for 6000 cycles and 50 N mechanical loading for 1.2×106 cycles. The other group was stored in 37 °C water for 24 hours. Nanoindentation hardness, Young modulus, and 3-point flexural strength were measured for the analyses of the mechanical properties. Surface roughness, surface microstructure, and elemental composition were measured to analyze the surface characteristics. Statistical analyses were performed with 1-way ANOVA with the Tukey HSD post hoc test, independent samples t test, Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni post hoc test, Mann-Whitney U test, and 2-way ANOVA (α=.05). Results: Before and after aging, CS exhibited the lowest hardness (1.20 to 1.04 GPa) and Young modulus (13.76 to 13.48 GPa) values (P<.05). EX exhibited the highest flexural strengths (393.43 to 391.86 MPa), and VM exhibited the lowest (109.98 to 112.73 MPa) values (P<.05). CS exhibited the highest surface roughness (Sa and Sq; 10.60 to 28.82, 14.21 to 38.27 nm) values (P<.05). After aging, the hardness and Young modulus of VM, EX, and VE decreased significantly (P<.001). No significant difference was observed in the flexural strengths of the CAD-CAM materials (P>.05). Significant increases were observed in the surface roughness of all the materials (P<.05), with altered microstructures. Except for the flexural strength, the mechanical properties and surface characteristics of the CAD-CAM materials were significantly affected by the material type after aging. Conclusions: Before and after aging, resin-nanoceramic exhibited the lowest hardness and Young modulus, and the highest surface roughness. Lithium disilicate glass-ceramic exhibited the highest flexural strength and feldspathic glass-ceramic exhibited the lowest value. After aging, increased surface roughness and microstructure alterations were observed. Significant interactions between aging process and material type were found for the mechanical properties and surface characteristics except for the flexural strength.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1002/chem.202200583
"Mechanical stability of dental CAD-CAM restoration materials made of monolithic zirconia, lithium disilicate, and lithium disilicate–strengthened aluminosilicate glass-ceramic with and without fatigue conditions","© 2020 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Studies investigating the mechanical stability of lithium disilicate–strengthened aluminosilicate glass-ceramic that do not require sintering after milling compared with other computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials are lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the flexural strength of CAD-CAM zirconia, lithium disilicate, and lithium disilicate–strengthened aluminosilicate glass-ceramics with and without fatigue conditions. Material and methods: Specimens (N=90, n=15) (12×4×3 mm) from the following CAD-CAM materials were prepared and polished: lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD); lithium disilicate–strengthened aluminosilicate glass-ceramic (N!ce); and zirconium dioxide ceramic (IPS e.max ZirCAD). All specimens were divided into 2 subgroups: immediate testing without aging and simulation of aging by using a mastication simulator for 1 200 000 cycles (5 °C-55 °C). Thereafter, flexural strength testing was performed by using a universal testing machine (1 mm/min) on nonaged and aged specimens. The data were evaluated by using nonparametric 2-way ANOVA and Wilcoxon rank post hoc tests (α=.05). Results: Both the material type and aging significantly affected the results (P<.001). The interaction was not significant (P>.05). Under nonaged conditions, zirconium dioxide ceramic (1136 ±162 MPa) showed significantly higher mean ±standard deviation flexural strength (P<.001) than lithium disilicate (304 ±34 MPa) and lithium disilicate–strengthened aluminosilicate glass-ceramic (202 ±17 MPa). The glass-ceramic groups were also significantly different from each other (P<.001). After aging, zirconium dioxide (1087.9 ±185.3 MPa) also presented significantly higher mean ±standard deviation flexural strength (P<.001) than lithium disilicate (259 ±62 MPa) and lithium disilicate–strengthened aluminosilicate glass-ceramic (172 ±11 MPa) (P<.001). Aging significantly decreased the flexural strength of lithium disilicate (14.6%) (P=.03) and lithium disilicate–strengthened aluminosilicate glass-ceramic (14.5%) (P=.01) but had minimal effect on the zirconium dioxide ceramic (4.3%) (P=.29). Conclusions: Among the tested CAD-CAM materials, the mechanical performance of lithium disilicate–strengthened aluminosilicate glass-ceramic was comparable with that of lithium disilicate and considerably lower than that of zirconia. Aging decreased the flexural strength of both lithium disilicate and lithium disilicate–strengthened aluminosilicate glass-ceramic.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164496

The CaO/SiO2 molar ratios of the mixtures were 0.17-0.39. Glass ceramics were produced by thermal treatment of frits obtained by quenching in water. The results show that samples with a high Fe2O3 content (>4 wt%) are not adequate for glass-ceramic formation, as a result of the effect of ferric iron, Fe3+, which increases the network connectivity, on the stability of the glass. The mechanical properties of the ceramic materials were as follows: elastic modulus of 97.8-106 GPa, Vickers microhardness of 612-701 MPa, fracture toughness of 0.45-0.84 MPa m1/2, and friction coefficient of 0.57-1.0. For the glass ceramics, the mass loss did not exceed 1% in NaOH and 15% in HNO3 as a result of the crystalline phases formed.

Interfacial Charge Modulation via in situ Fabrication of 3D Conductive Platform with MOF Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Highly-efficient photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into valuable carbon-contained chemicals possesses a tremendous potential in solving the energy crisis and global warming problem. However, the inadequate separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the unsatisfied capture of CO2 stay the chief roadblocks. Herein, we designed a novel photocatalyst for CO2 reduction by assembling three-dimensional graphene (3D GR) with a typical metal-organic framework material UIO-66-NH2, aiming to construct a built-in electric field for charge separation as well as taking advantage of the typical 3D structure of GR for maximizing the exposed absorption site on the surface. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity has been improved for the composite materials compared with that of the pure UIO-66-NH2. Further mechanism investigations proved that the enhanced photocatalytic performance is attributed to the synergy of enhanced CO2 absorption and inhibited photogenerated charge recombination, which could be owing to the better distribution and exposure of absorption and reaction sites on composites, and the redistribution of photogenerated carriers between 3D GR and UIO-66-NH2. This study provides a promising pathway to probe nanocomposites based on MOFs in environmental improvement and other relevant fields.",Chemistry - A European Journal,10.1039/d2ay00585a
Improved tunability accompanying with reduced permittivity in Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3-MgO composite ceramics achieved by spark plasma sintering,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3-MgO composite ceramics have been prepared through spark plasma sintering (SPS) process. Phase composition, microstructures and dielectric properties have been systematically characterized. In this composite system, with the gradual increase of the MgO content, the dielectric constant of the composite ceramics drops drastically. On the contrary, when the MgO content varies between 0% and 30%, the tunability of composite ceramics have not decreased significantly, but increased instead. High tunability of 16.53% and relatively low dielectric constant of 415 are realized simultaneous at 3 kV/mm, 10 kHz when the dielectric content is 30%. Its tunability is even higher than pure Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 under the same electric field condition, which indicates that SPS is an effective means to suppress the ion diffusion between ferroelectric-dielectric composite ceramics and improve the tunability.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.12659/MSM.936892
Lithium-boron-aluminum glasses and glass-ceramics doped with Eu3+: A potential optical thermometer for operation over a wide range of temperatures with uniform sensitivity,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, lithium-boron-aluminum (LBA) glasses doped with Eu3+ were produced by the traditional melting method. These precursor glasses (PG) were heat treated at 400 and 450 °C for 6 h to produce glass-ceramics (GC). The X-ray diffraction measurements showed the formation of a crystalline phase. In the LBA GCs, crystal growth is nucleated at the surface and an increase in the emission intensity of the heat-treated glasses compared with the PG was observed. Spectral analysis of the luminescence indicated that Eu3+ occupies low-symmetry site (asymmetry ratio ≈ 4) and without an inversion center. The emission spectra were analyzed using Judd-Ofelt theory and the intensity parameters Ω2, Ω4 and Ω6 were calculated. The values of these parameters were not significantly affected by the heat treatment process. The application of these materials as optical temperature sensors using the valley-peak intensity ratio (VPIR) was investigated using the multi-peak spectral profile of the 5D0 → 7FJ luminescence bands of Eu3+. We estimated the relative sensitivity, the figure-of-merit of the thermometer, to be as high as 0.40 ± 0.02% K−1. Interestingly, some VPIR that were explored presented a constant value for the relative sensitivity across the temperature interval used in our experiment (between 312 and 393 K), which is advantageous for sensor operation over a broad temperature range.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c00597
A simple cost-effective paper-based electrochemical device for detection of adulterated sibutramine in slimming products,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.This work presents the first paper-based electrochemical device, or ePAD, for direct detection of adulterated sibutramine in slimming products. The ePAD was fabricated using a screen-printing technique for defining the hydrophilic area for sample loading and for the working, reference and counter electrodes. The ePAD gave reproducible responses comparable to both conventional rod electrodes and commercial screen-printed electrodes (SPEs). Use of paper to fabricate the ePAD device provides advantages over the conventional SPE platforms (e.g. glass, ceramics and polymers) in terms of biocompatibility, strong capillary action and environmental friendliness. To detect sibutramine, square wave voltammetry was employed after sample loading on the circular hydrophilic area. The linear range is 2.51 to 83.7 mg L−1 sibutramine, with a precision of 6 %RSD (n = 3) and an instrumental limit of detection (3SD of intercept/slope) of 2.46 mg L−1 sibutramine. Recovery of spiked samples ranged from 83 to 116%. The samples were capsules, slimming coffee powders and nutraceutical beverages. The samples were appropriately diluted to give concentrations within the linear calibration range. Filtration of undissolved solids found with the capsules and coffee powder samples was not required, demonstrating that the method is not susceptible to solid particles. The ePAD is cost-effective (<US$1 per device) and suitable for on-site analysis.",Analytical Methods,10.1016/j.compscitech.2022.109458
Effect of Miswak Derivatives on Color Changes and Mechanical Properties of Polymer-Based Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Aided Manufactured (CAD/CAM) Dental Ceramic Materials,"© Med Sci MonitBackground: Miswak is a form of chewing stick used to clean teeth in different parts of the world, including Saudi Arabia. We present a description of the effects of miswak derivatives, namely toothpaste, mouthwash, and brushing sticks, on the mean color changes (DE00), compressive fracture resistance values, and fracture modes of polymer-based computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufactured (CAM) prosthetic materials. Material/Methods: Eighty-one rectangular-shaped samples were prepared from lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (Vita Suprinity), and monochromatic tooth-colored feldspar (Vitablocs Mark II) CAD/CAM ceramics. The color parameters were recorded using spectrophotometer before and after exposing the specimens to the different miswak oral hygiene derivatives for 15 days. Compressive fracture resistance values and fracture types were also assessed, and statistical analysis was performed. Results: Vita Suprinity and Vitablocs Mark II miswak sticks had the highest DE00 values. Moreover, miswak mouthwash had the lowest DE00 values, with significant differences among groups. IPS e.max CAD miswak sticks had the highest mean values of compressive fracture. Vitablocs Mark II had the lowest values for mouthwash and toothpaste. Significant differences were found within the IPS e.max CAD group. Reparable fractures were found in IPS e.max CAD, while semi-reparable fractures were seen in other groups. Conclusions: Most DE00 values were within the acceptable clinical range, with IPS e.max CAD showing superior color stability. The mouthwash group showed minimal DE00. IPS e.max CAD had the highest mean compressive fracture resistance values with reparable fracture types.",Medical Science Monitor,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121560

The glass anode sample is prepared with high-energy ball milling using the formula (37.5Na2O-62.5V2O5)(100-x):ZnOx (x = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mol %, labeled as Znx). Clear formation of nanocrystalline grains after heat treating the Zn20 glass anode for 15 h (Zn20-15h) supports the highest diffusion of Na+ ions. The specific discharge and charge capacities are recorded to be 380/370 (0 h), 394/381 (5 h), 427/420 (10 h), 444/439 (15 h), and 419/408 (20 h) mA h/g for different heat treating schedules. It is also worth noting that the initial charge and discharge capacities of the Zn20 glass-ceramic anode sample (after heat treatment) are higher than those of the corresponding glass sample (before heat treatment) but recorded to be the highest for the 15 h heat treating schedule compared with other schedules. The cycling behavior of the Zn20-15h glass-ceramic anode at 4000 mA/g displays longer cycle life stability and high rate capability along with Coulombic efficiency and relatively fast electronic and ionic conductivity even up to 3000 cycles.",Energy and Fuels,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121546
Robust numerical analysis of fibrous composites from X-ray computed tomography image data enabling low resolutions,"© 2022 The AuthorsX-ray computed tomography scans can provide detailed information about the state of the material after manufacture and in service. X-ray computed tomography aided engineering (XAE) was recently introduced as an automated process to transfer 3D image data to finite element models. The implementation of a structure tensor code for material orientation analysis in combination with a newly developed integration point-wise fibre orientation mapping allows an easy applicable, computationally cheap, fast, and accurate model set-up. The robustness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a non-crimp fabric glass fibre reinforced composite for a low resolution case with a voxel size of 64 μm corresponding to more than three times the fibre diameter.

Here, a series of Cr3+-doped dual-phase glass-ceramics were successfully prepared. The Mg2Al4Si5O18 and MgAl2Si3O10 nanocrystals with particle sizes smaller than 200 nm were precipitated simultaneously in glass-ceramics. The density and molar volume showed an opposite trend with the rise in crystallization temperatures. The two excitation bands were revealed in the excitation spectra monitored at 985 nm, and the crystal field strength of Cr3+ was 2.259 ∼ 2.542. Under the excitation of 400 nm and 466 nm xenon lamps, the broadband emission peaks centered at ∼985 nm with a full width at half maximum of 148∼169 nm were observed, indicating that the dual-phase glass-ceramics were suitable for NIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the tunable emission was achieved by selective enrichment of Cr3+ ions into Mg2Al4Si5O18 and MgAl2Si3O10 nanocrystals, which paves the way for the development of high-efficiency and broadband NIR emitting materials.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.02.276

A PVP-silica-titania hybrid film for low-voltage organic field-effect transistor,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A PVP-silica-titania hybrid film with excellent dielectric properties was fabricated by the sol–gel method at low temperature (180 °C). The film has a high dielectric constant (k = 13), a low leakage current density (<20nA cm−2 at 2 V), and a smooth surface (Rq < 0.4 nm). The organic field-effect transistor (OFET), with the PVP-silica-titania hybrid film, had been fabricated and compared with the OFET, which was fabricated with SiO2 dielectric. The electrical performance of the device had obviously improved in the operating voltage (−1.5 V), threshold voltage (−0.35 V), and mobility (0.7 cm2 V−1 s−1). To investigate the suitability of the PVP-silica-titania hybrid film in flexible applications, a low-voltage flexible OFET was fabricated. The device had been tested in the bending state and exhibited good performance under the ambition conditions.

Remarkable photoluminescence enhancement and tuning in Eu/CdS co-doped chloroborosilicate glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The effect of heat treatment was studied on Eu/CdS co-doped chloroborosilicate glass having a new composition 37.8SiO2–27B2O3–18BaO–3.6K2O–3.6Al2O3–10BaCl2 (mol%) recently developed in our group. The base glass has been proven to be a suitable host for various rare-earth ions and metallic nanoparticles, also upon controlled crystallization, because it has the potential to yield low-phonon energy (350 cm−1) BaCl2 crystals. The glasses were heat treated at 650 °C for several time durations. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the presence of CdS quantum dots (QDs) and BaCl2 crystals in the heat-treated glasses. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the formation of glass-ceramics, with the presence of BaCl2-based phases. When heat-treated, all the Eu/CdS co-doped glasses showed an intense enhancement in Eu3+/Eu2+ emissions up to 30 or 40 h of heat treatment, followed by a gradual decrease. The initial increase is due to the formation of low-phonon energy BaCl2-based crystalline phases as well as the generation and growth of CdS QDs at elevated temperature. The subsequent decrease in PL intensity is attributed to the concentration quenching effect of the QDs. The rate of enhancement was significantly higher when glasses formed opaque glass-ceramics due to the change in environment of the Eu ions and scattering effect. The maximum intensity enhancement due to the CdS co-doping and glass crystallization was observed to be 400 times as compared to the non heat-treated glass containing the same amount of Eu. This enhancement is quite remarkable in rare-earth/semiconductor co-doped glasses and can be useful in various photonic applications.",Ceramics International,10.1021/acsapm.2c00217
Preparation of Sb2Se3-based ceramics and glass-ceramics from native thin films deposited on Kapton foil,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Amorphous Sb2Se3 thin films (200–1500 nm) deposited on Kapton foil were crystallized in controlled environment using the method of direct calorimetric measurement of thin films. X-ray diffraction was used to determine the intensity of the 1D (Sb4Sb6)n ribbons preferential orientation in dependence on the processing conditions: film thickness, energy flux during the pulsed laser deposition (PLD), heating rate, low and high temperature annealing. Lower PLD energy flux combined with higher deposited film thickness (1500 nm) led to increased orientation in the [2 2 1] direction, which is favorable for thin film solar cells application. Raman spectroscopy showed that thermally induced crystallization produces oxide-free Sb2Se3 thin films. Description of the crystallization kinetics led to very accurate kinetic predictions for the isothermal annealing conditions suitable for preparation of glass-ceramics with defined amount of crystalline phase – the predictions were accurate to ∼10% of the true (experimentally determined) value.",Ceramics International,10.3788/COL202220.063401
Enabling Lower Energy Light Harvesting in Stilbene-Based Photomechanical Polymers via Triplet Sensitization,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Photoresponsive polymers, typically activated with direct excitation of an azobenzene moiety, are an intriguing class of materials for application as adaptive structures. Here, we introduce triplet excited state sensitization as a mechanism to harness light in a stilbene-based photopolymer (i.e., the carbon analogue of azobenzene). While the undoped film shows no response, the sensitized film exhibits polarization dependent bending under 445 nm irradiation via (1) sensitizer excitation, (2) triplet energy transfer, (3) stilbene isomerization, and (4) subunit reorientation. This work is the first to demonstrate stilbene-based photopolymers and triplet sensitization as a low energy light harvesting mechanism in photomechanics.",ACS Applied Polymer Materials,10.1002/app.52251
Resin Wettability Correlates Linearly to Interfacial Fracture Energy between Thermosetting Elastomers and Glass,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Interfacial adhesion influences mechanical strength, structural integrity, and overall performance for adhesively bonded structures and composite materials. In this work, we investigate the effect of resin formulation chemistry on wetting behavior and interfacial adhesion with a glass substrate. Thermosetting elastomer resin and cured network properties, including viscosity, surface tension, glass transition temperature, and molecular weight between cross-links, were also characterized, and the relative importance of these properties on adhesive strength was evaluated. Resin wettability was found to be the factor most predictive of adhesive strength between thermosetting elastomers and glass surfaces, with increasing wettability (decreasing resin contact angle) correlated with increasing interfacial fracture energy. This finding provides a convenient and fast method to screen polymer networks and enables informed tailoring of interfacial fracture energy.",ACS Applied Polymer Materials,10.1039/d2qi01003h
Perovskite-quantum-dots activated silica fiber X-ray dosimeter,"© 2022 Chinese Optics Letters.A new type of X-ray fiber dosimeters is proposed that is based on the X-ray response of CsPbBr3 perovskite-quantum-dots (PQDs) activated silica fiber. Such a fiber sensor is constructed by covering a multimode silica fiber with PQDs embedded glass powders using a transparent high-temperature glue. Under X-ray irradiation, the fiber sensor emits bright green light at 525 nm, which can be readily recorded by a CCD spectrometer. The integrated radioluminescence intensity has an excellent linear response to the X-ray dose. Study is given to the fiber sensor concerning its thermal stability in a temperature range of room temperature up to 300°C, resistance to water erosion, and prolonged X-ray irradiation. The results verify that the proposed fiber sensor has the advantages of good thermal stability, chemical durability, and radiation hardness. The studied X-ray fiber sensor holds promise to be used in a real-time, in-situ, and remote radiation dose monitoring.",Chinese Optics Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c04392
Effects of nano-TiO2 on the structure and properties of composite materials constructed from eggshell powder/poly(butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate),"© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.In the present work, the effects of nano-TiO2 on the properties and structure of eggshell powder/poly(butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) composites were comprehensively explored. The results showed that nano-TiO2 could promote the tensile strength and water resistance of the composite material, as well as reduce the light transmittance. Nano-TiO2 reacted with PBAT to form the C-O-Ti bonds, resulted in enhanced structure stability of the composite material. Nano-TiO2 served as the nanoscale filler to improve the internal compatibility of the composites through hydrogen bonds. Besides, the crystallization performance of the polymer system was also altered by nano-TiO2 incorporation. These changes in structure promoted the thermal stability and surface hydrophobicity. Finally, the antibacterial test was performed, and the nanocomposite material containing nano-TiO2 exhibited excellent antibacterial properties. This research provides a novel strategy for constructing an eggshell powder/PBAT/nano-TiO2 nanocomposite biodegradable plastic that could be used for the development of antibacterial materials.",Journal of Applied Polymer Science,10.1016/j.saa.2022.121079
Light induced ammonia synthesis by crystalline polyoxometalate-based hybrid frameworks coupled with the Sv-1T MoS2 cocatalyst,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The exploration of efficient and stable composite-materials as nitrogen reduction photocatalysts featuring wide spectrum absorption and nitrogen fixation active sites has become specifically significant. In this work, a series of mixed-addendum PMoV-based organic-inorganic hybrid materials coupled with rich sulfur vacancy 1T MoS2 (Sv-1T MoS2) through a hydrothermal growth strategy are presented towards green NH3 production. The intervalence electron transfer of the reduced polyoxometalates, as well as the construction of a Ni-trinuclear cluster-based framework, is responsible for the capable light-harvesting performance of the well-defined PMo8V6-Ni crystalline material, and Sv-1T MoS2 which serves as a cocatalyst can facilitate electron-hole separation of the light absorbers, which further promotes the ammonia production capacity of the composite materials. As expected, the ammonia generation rate of Sv-1T MoS2/PMo8V6-Ni (80.6 μmol h−1 g−1) is much higher than that of either PMo8V6-Ni (9.7 μmol h−1 g−1) or Sv-1T MoS2 (8.6 μmol h−1 g−1) component. Such a noble-metal-free system therefore shows an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 0.368% at 550 nm. The “working-in-tandem” mechanism established by sulfur vacancies as nitrogen active sites and polyoxometalate crystalline photosensitizers are extremely crucial for facilitating N2 chemisorption and NH3 formation. This work provides a fresh perspective for the rational design of photocatalyst composite materials with energetic electrons towards efficient nitrogen fixation.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164221
Femtosecond X-ray Laser Reveals Intact Sea-Island Structures of Metastable Solid-State Electrolytes for Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Experimental characterization of the nanostructure of metastable functional materials has attracted significant attention with recent advances in computational materials discovery. However, since metastable glass-ceramics are easily damaged by irradiation, damage-free nanoimaging has not been realized thus far. Herein, we propose novel high-contrast coherent diffractive imaging that quantitatively analyzes the intact internal nanostructure of metastable glass-ceramics using femtosecond X-ray pulses. The immersion of sample particles in a solvent helps enhance the reconstructed image contrast and allows us to distinguish an ∼7% electron density difference between an amorphous form and crystals. Furthermore, morphological operations with a band-pass filter quantitatively elucidate the depth information. The evaluated volume ratio of the amorphous to crystalline phases is ∼2.5:1 for the measured metastable (Li2S)70-(P2S5)30glass-ceramic particle. Sulfide glass-ceramics are used as electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries, which are indispensable for reducing the carbon footprint.

"Crystallization effects on the photoluminescence efficiency of SrO-B2O3 glass activated by W6+, Eu3+, Dy3+ or Pr3+ ions","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Binary strontium borate host glass together with samples doped with 0.25 %WO3 and one of the rare – earth ions (0.125% Eu3+, Dy3+ or Pr3+) were prepared by conventional melting – annealing technique. DTA analysis of the host base glass was carried out to derive the proper temperatures which are necessary to convert glasses into their corresponding glass –ceramic through controlled thermal heat –treatment regime. Measurements of optical, FTIR, and PL spectra were carried out with special analysis of the spectral properties. The identity of glass – ceramic derivatives were investigated through x-ray diffraction, and TEM & SEM tools to identify their crystalline morphological features. The absorption spectrum of WO3 – doped glass refers to the existence of dominant hexavalent tungsten ions. The RE- doped glass reveal characteristic visible – NIR absorption peaks due to the respective rare earth ions. FTIR spectra show absorption bands due to both triangular and tetravalent borate groups (BO3, BO4).PL spectra reveal excitation and emission characteristic peaks due to each specific rare earth ions. XRD indicate the preference of the host glass to form strontium pyroborate (SrB4O7) crystalline phase. This facilitates the clear knowledge of the crystallization behavior and hence can justify the effect of the crystallization on the studied properties.",Spectrochimica Acta - Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy,10.36410/jcpr.2022.23.3.304

It was proved by XRD and XPS that the target crystal phase was successfully obtained. 750 ℃/180 min was selected as the heat treatment condition, after analyzing the micro-morphology, fluorescence spectra, transmittance curves and Vickers hardness of glass-ceramics. Under this condition, the luminescence intensity and Vickers hardness of glass-ceramic were about 50% and 30% higher than that of precursor glass, respectively. The chromaticity coordinate of the 2.0%Dy3+-1.0%Eu3+ co-doped glass-ceramic was (0.4158, 0.3862), and the correlated color temperature was 3179 K. Its excellent stability to thermal quenching at LED working temperature (423–473 K) was observed and the luminescence intensity can be maintained above 89.6% of room temperature. The activation energy of 2.0%Dy3+-1.0%Eu3+ co-doped glass-ceramic was estimated to be 0.3548 eV by temperature-dependent emission spectra, and the color coordinate shift was small, about 5.4 × 10−3.

Preparation of entirely waste-based glass-ceramics from municipal solid waste incineration fly ash 利用生活垃圾焚烧飞灰制备全废物基微晶玻璃,"© 2022 Science Press. All rights reserved.Municipal solid waste incineration fly ash was categorized as hazardous waste and its management had drawn widespread attention with the promotion and application of waste-to-energy technology. An entirely waste-based glass-ceramic of CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 system was synthesized from municipal solid waste incineration fly ash, coal fly ash and waste glass. The effect of sintering temperature and basicity (CaO/SiO2) on the crystal phase transition, physical-mechanical performance and microstructure of the glass-ceramics and the crystallization kinetic of parent glasses were investigated. The results indicated that all the parent glass exhibited three-dimensional bulk crystallization when basicity was in range of 0.48-0.70, the increase of basicity decreased the crystallization activation energy of parent glass. The coexisting crystal phases in the glass-ceramics were anorthite, wollastonite and gehlenite and the type of crystal phases was not affected by sintering temperature and basicity. When basicity was 0.56 (GC2), the compressive strength increased in general with the increase of sintering temperature but the microhardness exhibited the opposite trend. With the increase of basicity, the compressive strength increased firstly and then decreased, its maximum value was 553.77 MPa when basicity was 0.56, the microhardness increased and its maximum value was 5.89 GPa when basicity was 0.70. In addition, the toxic leaching test results of typical heavy metals showed that the leaching concentrations of heavy metals in glass-ceramics were far below limitation and there was no potential risk to the environment. The results of this study can provide theoretical and data support for the resource utilization of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash.",Chinese Journal of Environmental Engineering,10.1109/TMECH.2020.3040755

All rights reserved.This paper studies the nuclear glass ceramic based on aluminosilicate glass. It is proposed the addition of TiO2 on the crystalline phase. The structure and chemical durability have been investigated. The materials with four TiO2 contents, ranging from 4.11 to 7.11 wt.%, are synthesized by a discontinuous method. The 7.11 wt.% TiO2 glass ceramic synthesis was not successful and crystallizes during the melting stage. For the others materials, Archimedes density ranges between 2.891 and 2.962 g/cm3. For the majority of materials, X-ray diffraction analysis allows the identification of an aluminosilicate that belongs to pyroxenes silicates family as the initial phase, powelite and calzirtite. These phases are known as radionuclides’ sequestration minerals. Both SEM and DTA analyses confirm these findings. The FTIR analysis of materials reveals the complex glass-ceramics chemical composition. MCC1 and MCC2 tests, performed on selected glass ceramic materials, indicate that the materials containing 4.11 and 5.11 wt.% TiO2 are the most durable against Si, Al, Mg and Ce elements release, in MCC2 test; the Ce (minor actinide surrogate) leaching rate being negligible (193.7☓10-9 kg/m2d after 28 leaching days for 5.11 wt.% of TiO2 content).

The excellent properties and solidifying effect of Cr providing by micro-crystal grain in slag glass-ceramics,"©2022 The Ceramic Society of Japan. All rights reserved.Using stainless steel slag (SSS) and coal fly ash as raw materials to prepare glass-ceramics with excellent properties, the toxic and unstable Cr (VI) in the SSS was non-toxic converted into Cr (III). By Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and performance testing methods, the relationship among phase composition, microstructure and properties of the CaOMgOAl2O3SiO2 (CMAS) system slag glass-ceramics prepared at Tg = 750 °C and Tc = 950 °C was studied (Tg, glass transition temperature; Tc, crystalline temperature). The heavy metal Cr was solidification in the slag glass-ceramics by the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), which was satisfied the limitation of standard “DZ/T 0279.2-2016” of China and the solidifying effect of glass-ceramics was more obvious than that of glasses. The detoxification effect was verified through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The experimental results showed that the physical performance of glass-ceramics increased with the increase of the content of SSS. As for the products from the mixed sources, the best product properties of G42 (1.05 wt % Cr2O3) glass-ceramics (bending strength, 230.58 « 13.21 MPa; hardness, 878.30 « 18 N/cm2) was the SSS content of 21 %. Moreover, the generation of spinel phase was the key crystal phase for solidifying heavy metal Cr. With the increase of the SSS, the spinel phase increased. In contrast, G42 was the most superior product performances of solidified Cr. In addition, it can be found that the unstable ratio (UR) of G42 is the smallest (UR = 0.01544) for heavy metal Cr in the leaching solution. It was further confirmed that the heavy metal Cr is effectively solidified in the glass-ceramics.",Journal of the Ceramic Society of Japan,10.3390/ma15113987
Neural Network Gaussian Process Considering Input Uncertainty for Composite Structure Assembly,"© 1996-2012 IEEE.Developing machine-learning-enabled smart manufacturing is promising for a composite structure assembly process. To improve production quality and efficiency of the assembly process, accurate predictive analysis on dimensional deviations and residual stress of the composite structures is required. The novel composite structure assembly involves two challenges: 1) the highly nonlinear and anisotropic properties of composite materials; and 2) inevitable uncertainty in the assembly process. To overcome those problems, in this article, we propose a neural network Gaussian process model considering input uncertainty for composite structure assembly. Deep architecture of our model allows us to approximate a complex process better, and consideration of input uncertainty enables robust modeling with complete incorporation of the process uncertainty. Based on simulation and case study, the neural network Gaussian process considering input uncertainty can outperform other benchmark methods when the response function is nonsmooth and nonlinear. Although we use composite structure assembly as an example, the proposed methodology can be applied to other engineering systems with intrinsic uncertainties.",IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,10.3390/ma15113797
The Crystallization and Fracture Toughness of Transparent Glass-ceramics with Various Al2O3 Additions for Mobile Devices,"© 2022, Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, Part of Springer Nature.Li2O−Al2O3−SiO2 (LAS) glass-ceramics were prepared by a melting method. Effects of different Al2O3 content on the structure, crystallization, transmittance and fracture toughness of LAS glass-ceramics were investigated by means of XRD, FESEM and other methods as well. The results showed that the glass transition temperature and crystallization temperature of samples increased as the content of Al2O3 increased from 4.1 wt% to 13.1 wt%, which restrained the precipitation of lithium disilicate crystals. The main crystalline phase of glass-ceramics transformed from lithium disilicate and petalite to silicon dioxide, which reduced the fracture toughness of glass-ceramics. When the Al2O3 content was 7.1 wt%, the specimen had outstanding transmittance and fracture toughness. The transmittance was 90.32%. The fracture toughness was 1.13 MPa · m1/2. Compared with high-alumina glass, the fracture toughness of the glass-ceramic was greatly improved, and it could be used as a new type of protective material for mobile devices.","Journal Wuhan University of Technology, Materials Science Edition",10.3390/ma15113800
Fractographic and Microhardness Evaluation of All‐Ceramic Hot‐Pressed and CAD/CAM Restorations after Hydrothermal Aging,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.All‐ceramic dental restorations have great advantages, such as highly esthetical properties, a less complex fabrication, and a similar abrasion resistance to enamel. Despite these advantages, ceramic materials are more prone to fracture due to their brittle microstructure. The main aim of this in vitro study was to determine the difference in hot‐pressed and milled glass‐ceramic mechanical properties such as fracture resistance and microhardness (VHN). Four types of ceramics, two hot‐pressed and two milled, feldspathic glass‐ceramics and zirconia‐reinforced glass‐ceramics were selected in this study and tested using the static loading test and Vicker’s testing. Hydrothermal aging, consisting of different baths with temperatures between 5 degrees Celsius and 55 degrees Celsius, was chosen as the in vitro aging method. Statistical analyses are performed using SPSS Statistics software at a significance level of p < 0.05. Micro‐hardness values decrease after hydrothermal aging. The static loading test reveals a significant difference between the feldspathic hot‐pressed glass‐ceramic, which fractures at lower forces, and milled zirconia‐reinforced lithium silicate glass‐ceramic, which fractures at greater forces (N). Fractographic analysis of the fractured fragments resulted in the static loading test revealing different surface features about the crack origins and propagations under a stereomicroscope.",Materials,10.3390/coatings12060715
Crystallization Mechanism and Optical Properties of Antimony-Germanate-Silicate Glass-Ceramic Doped with Europium Ions,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Glass-ceramic is semi-novel material with many applications, but it is still problematic in obtaining fibers. This paper aims to develop a new glass-ceramic material that is a compromise between crystallization, thermal stability, and optical properties required for optical fiber technology. This compromise is made possible by an alternative method with a controlled crystallization process and a suitable choice of the chemical composition of the core material. In this way, the annealing process is eliminated, and the core material adopts a glass-ceramic character with high transparency directly in the drawing process. In the experiment, low phonon antimony-germanate-silicate glass (SGS) doped with Eu3+ ions and different concentrations of P2O5 were fabricated. The glass material crystallized during the cooling process under conditions similar to the drawing processes’. Thermal stability (DSC), X-ray photo analysis (XRD), and spectroscopic were measured. Eu3+ ions were used as spectral probes to determine the effect of P2O5 on the asymmetry ratio for the selected transitions (5D0 →7F1 and5D0 →7F2). From the measurements, it was observed that the material produced exhibited amorphous or glass-ceramic properties, strongly dependent on the nucleator concentration. In addition, the conducted study confirmed that europium ions co-form the EuPO4 structure during the cooling process from 730◦C to room temperature. Moreover, the asymmetry ratio was changed from over 4 to under 1. The result obtained confirms that the developed material has properties typical of transparent glass-ceramic while maintaining high thermal stability, which will enable the fabrication of fibers with the glass-ceramic core.",Materials,10.1007/s10971-022-05772-6
Optimal Design of Ceramic Based Hip Implant Composites Using Hybrid AHP-MOORA Approach,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Designing excellent hip implant composite material with optimal physical, mechanical and wear properties is challenging. Improper hip implant composite design may result in a premature component and product failure. Therefore, a hybrid decision-making tool was proposed to select the optimal hip implant composite according to several criteria that are probably conflicting. In varying weight proportions, a series of hip implant composite materials containing different ceramics (magnesium oxide, zirconium oxide, chromium oxide, silicon nitride and aluminium oxide) were fabricated and evaluated for wear and physicomechanical properties. The density, void content, hardness, indentation depth, elastic modulus, compressive strength, wear, and fracture toughness values were used to rank the hip implant composites. It was found that the density and void content of the biocomposites remain in the range of 3.920–4.307 g/cm3 and 0.0021–0.0089%, respectively. The composite without zirconium oxide exhibits the lowest density (3.920 g/cm3), while the void content remains lowest for the composite having no chromium oxide content. The highest values of hardness (28.81 GPa), elastic modulus (291 GPa) and fracture toughness (11.97 MPa.m1/2) with the lowest wear (0.0071 mm3/million cycles) were exhibited by the composites having 83 wt.% of aluminium oxide and 10 wt.% of zirconium oxide. The experimental results are compositional dependent and without any visible trend. As a result, selecting the best composites among a group of composite alternatives becomes challenging. Therefore, a hybrid AHP-MOORA based multi-criteria decision-making approach was adopted to choose the best composite alternative. The AHP (analytic hierarchy process) was used to calculate the criteria weight, and MOORA (multiple objective optimisation on the basis of ratio analysis) was used to rank the composites. The outcomes revealed that the hip implant composite with 83 wt.% aluminium oxide, 10 wt.% zirconium oxide, 5 wt.% silicon nitride, 3 wt.% magnesium oxide, and 1.5 wt.% chromium oxide had the best qualities. Finally, sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the ranking’s robustness and stability concerning the criterion weight.",Materials,10.1007/s40831-022-00534-8
Effect of Optical Properties of Lithium Disilicate Glass Ceramics and Light-Curing Protocols on the Curing Performance of Resin Cement,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This study aimed to investigate the effects of optical properties of lithium disilicate glass ceramics and the light-curing protocols (LCP) on the curing performance of light-cured resin cement. Lithium disilicate glass-ceramics with different optical properties were sectioned to produce ceramic specimens of 0.8 mm thickness. Irradiance through the ceramic specimens was measured by a radiometer. Light transmittance of ceramics was assessed using a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. The light-cured resin cement was injected into a Teflon mold and ceramics with different optical properties were placed on it, cured under different LCPs, and the degree of conversion (DC) and Vickers microhardness of the resin cement were separately measured by Micro-ATR/FTIR spectrometry and the microhardness tester. The shade (p < 0.001) and transparency (p < 0.001) of ceramics affect the irradiance of the light-curing unit. The transparency (p < 0.001) of the ceramic and light-curing protocols (p < 0.001) affect the DC and microhardness of resin cements. When the thickness of the ceramic is 0.8 mm, the light transmittance of the ceramic and the curing performance of the resin cement increase with the increase of the transparency of the ceramic. An appropriate increase in irradiance and exposure time can optimize the curing performance of resin cement. These factors should be taken into account by the clinician when designing the bonding solution for porcelain veneers.",Coatings,10.1007/s42765-021-00123-6

Circular Economy Applied to Metallurgical Waste: Use of Slags and Fly Ash from the Ferronickel Industry in the Production of Eco-Friendly Composites,"© 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.The aim of this paper is studying the use of industrial, solid waste materials from the ferronickel industry (fly ash—FA, electric furnace slag—EFS and converter slag—CS) as a reinforcing component in new value-added polymer-based composite: eco-friendly, functional geo-membranes. The studied geo-membranes were produced by film-casting method using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) matrix reinforced by the previously mentioned metallurgical waste materials, as-obtained and modified in acid (HCl) and alkaline (NaOH) medium. The study of the produced systems was done through observation and analysis of the effect on their: (i) morphology and internal structure (SEM and FTIR analysis), (ii) thermal stability (TG/DTA/DTG analysis) and (iii) moisture stability (the swelling kinetics was followed and the ultimate rate of swelling after 24 h was determined). The morphology of the waste materials is of spherical and polygonal non-regular shape. The morphology and microstructural properties of the obtained FA/PVC composites confirmed region of well dispersed particles where the particles were tightly embedded and mechanically interlocked in the PVC matrix indicating strong interfacial interaction with the polymer matrix. All waste materials were thermally stable with minimal 0.8% weight loss, EFS has been shown as the most stable with weight loss of 0.1% near 350 °C. Generally, all the studied composites have shown a higher swelling degree in comparison with PVC, where the composites reinforced with FA have shown the best performances in adsorption test.

Tailored Carrier Transport Path by Interpenetrating Networks in Cathode Composite for High Performance All-Solid-State Li-SeS2 Batteries,"© 2022, Donghua University, Shanghai, China.All-solid-state Li-SeS2 batteries (ASSLSs) are more attractive than traditional liquid Li-ion batteries due to superior thermal stability and higher energy density. However, various factors limit the practical application of all-solid-state Li-SeS2 batteries, such as the low ionic conductivity of the solid-state electrolyte and the poor kinetic property of the cathode composite, resulting in unsatisfactory rate capability. Here, we employed a traditional ball milling method to design a Li7P2.9W0.05S10.85 glass–ceramic electrolyte with high conductivity of 2.0 mS cm− 1 at room temperature. In order to improve the kinetic property, an interpenetrating network strategy is proposed for rational cathode composite design. Significantly, the disordered cathode composite with an interpenetrating network could promote electronic and ionic conduction and intimate contacts between the electrolyte–electrode particles. Moreover, the tortuosity factor of the carrier transport channel is considerably reduced in electrode architectures, leading to superior kinetic performance. Thus, assembled ASSLS exhibited higher capacity and better rate capability than its counterpart. This work demonstrates that an interpenetrating network is essential for improving carrier transport in cathode composite for high rate all-solid-state Li-SeS2 batteries.

Elastic-plastic progressive damage model and low-velocity impact failure mechanism of composite materials,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdAn elastic-plastic progressive damage model (PDM-3DEP) was proposed to study the mechanical response and damage development of composite laminates under low-velocity impact. The 3D Hashin failure criterion and an improved three-dimensional damage evolution model that considers strain component of ε33 and shear stain are implemented to describe the initiation and evolution of damage modes. The zero-thickness cohesive elements which follow bilinear traction-separation law are applied to simulate delamination. The numerical and experimental mechanical curves and damage distribution of composite laminate with a stacking sequence of 03o/45o/−45oS were compared to verify the proposed PDM-3DEP. The consistent results of the numerical and experimental data indicates that the proposed method can accurately describe damage mechanical behavior under low-velocity impact. Moreover, another type of composite laminate with a stacking sequence of 02o/902o/02o/902o/02oS is adopted for further verification. It is concluded that the proposed model can accurately analyze the mechanical responses of different composite laminates.",Materials Today Communications,10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.03.021

However, fiber fabrication necessitates temperature much higher (typically up to 2000◦ C) than the one required for bulk glass. In this article, we report on the reactivity of fluoride ions in LaF3 with SiO2 and GeO2 (a common dopant used to dope optical fiber) powders at high temperature. TGA, EDX-SEM, XRD and Raman analyses were performed. Above 1000◦ C, LaF3 starts to react, preferentially with SiO2, to form SiF4 gaseous species. The remaining lanthanum ions form La2 Si2 O7 and La2 Ge2 O7 phases. These results could contribute to improve material development for the fiber optics community.",Ceramics,10.1007/s40145-022-0595-1
Patterned glass ceramic design for high-brightness high-color-quality laser-driven lightings,"© 2022, The Author(s).Up-to-date laser-driven lightings confront a challenge of simultaneously achieving good photometric and chromatic performances. Herein, the coupling of “patterned package design” and “phosphor wheel” was proposed and demonstrated effectively to deal with this tough issue, based on a new architecture of CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ (CASN:Eu) glass ceramic film (GCF) on Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce) GC plate. The fabricated composite has no interface between the two functional layers and retains the admirable luminescent features from CASN:Eu and YAG:Ce for the microstructural integrity during co-sintering. The studies on laser-microcrystalline interactions reveal that the luminescence saturation is almost determined by thermal quenching for YAG:Ce, but is ascribed to thermal/intensity quenching which are equally crucial for CASN:Eu. Benefiting from the elaborate architecture design, good color chromaticity tunability was obtained, and severe photon reabsorption was reduced. Moreover, accompanied with the rotation induced increase of thermal convection to air and pulse-like excitation, the constructed lighting engine under blue laser driven shows bright white light with luminous flux (LF) higher than 1000 lm, adjustable chromaticity from cool to warm, and improved color rendering index (CRI) approaching to 70.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Journal of Advanced Ceramics,10.1007/s10854-022-08305-7
Effect of different surface treatments and thermomechanical aging on the ion elution of CAD-CAM materials,"© 2022 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Dental ceramics have been reported to elute ions when subjected to nonneutral pH. However, the effect of surface treatments and thermomechanical aging on the ion elution of CAD-CAM ceramics is unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the effect of surface treatment (glazed or polished) and thermomechanical aging on the ion elution of CAD-CAM materials before and after 2-body wear simulation. Material and methods: Specimens were prepared from 6 CAD-CAM materials—leucite (LC), feldspathic (FP), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS), lithium disilicate (LDS) glass-ceramics, polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN), and zirconia (ZIR)—and divided into 2 groups according to the surface treatments (glazed or polished) (n=6). For baseline ion elution values, specimens were placed into polyethylene bottles containing deionized water (pH 7.4) that had been stored in an incubator for 168 hours at 37 °C. The eluted ions in the immersion solution were measured by using inductively coupled plasma-optic emission spectrophotometry. The specimens were then subjected to thermomechanical aging by using human enamel as an antagonist. After aging, the ion elution of the specimens was remeasured. Ion elution data before and after 2-body wear were analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney U test, while the effect of 2-body wear was assessed by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test (α=.05). Results: The presence of some ions varied depending on the material-surface treatment pair before (Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, K, Li, Mg, Na, P, and Zn) and after (Al, B, Ba, Ca, Co, Li, Mg, and P) 2-body wear. Polished materials had higher ion elution than the glazed materials before 2-body wear (P≤.041), except for LC (P and Zn) and PICN (Ca, Cu, and K) (P≤.009). After 2-body wear, polished LC (B and Ba), FP (Al, B, and Mg), ZLS (Al, Ba, Ca, and Li), ZIR (B and Ba), glazed PICN (Ca, Mg, and P), ZLS (P), and ZIR (Co) presented higher ion elution than their counterparts (P≤.041). The effect of 2-body wear on the ion elution of polished LC (Al, K), FP (Na), ZLS (Li), LDS (K, Na), PICN (Al, Na), ZIR (Na, Y), glazed LC (Na), FP (Ba, Na), ZLS (B, Ba, Y), LDS (Na), PICN (Y), and ZIR (Na) was nonsignificant (P≥.075). However, the elution of remaining ions showed a significant difference before and after 2-body wear (P≤.046). Conclusions: The chemical stability of tested CAD-CAM materials was affected by the 2-body wear. Glazing led to a lower ion elution except for LDS and PICN. While polishing resulted in lower ion elution for PICN, both surface treatments resulted in similar ion elution for LDS.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1016/j.optmat.2022.112382
Sunlight activated ultra-stable long persistent luminescence glass ceramic for outdoor information display,"© 2022, The Author(s).Natural sunlight activated persistent luminescence (PeL) is ideal candidate for optical information display in outdoors without the requirement of electric supply. Except the brightness and duration, the stability especially water resistance of the PeL materials is of significant importance for practical application, which remains a great obstacle up to date. Herein, we report a new sunlight activated PeL glass ceramic containing hexagonal Sr13Al22Si10O66:Eu2+ crystals, which exhibits strong blue PeL and can last more than 200 h. The PeL can be charged by the full wavelengths located in AM 1.5G due to the broad distribution of traps in the crystal structure. The PeL is clearly observed by the naked eye even after 24 h upon sunlight irradiation irrespective of the weather, and the photoluminescence intensity only decreased ∼3.3% after storing in water for 365 d. We demonstrate its potential application for thermal and stress responsive display as well as long-term continuous security indication upon sunlight irradiation, which not only save vast energy and reduce environment pollution, but also are appropriate for outdoor usage.

"Production of Eu-doped LiFePO4 by glass–ceramic technique and investigation of their thermal, structural, electrochemical performances","© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.LiFe1−xEuxPO4 (x = 0–0.1) samples were successfully fabricated by glass–ceramics technique quenching from high temperature. Thermal properties were analyzed by DTA analysis. Crystallization activation energy and Avrami parameters were calculated depending on the Eu content and heating rates. The XRD analysis shows that there are two-phases of LiFePO4 and Li3Fe2P3O12 which compete with Eu-doping in the samples and it is found that the x = 0.02 sample has the lowest impurity phases. The battery cells exhibit similar cycling voltammetry (CV) data with the undoped LiFePO4 battery cells. The charging/discharging cycles measurements were done for C/2-rate at room conditions and the best capacity value for C/2-rate was obtained as 149.4 mAh/g for x = 0.02 Eu-doped sample. Although the best capacity was obtained for x = 0.02, the best capacity fade was obtained for x = 0.03 Eu-doped sample. C-rate measurements provided that x = 0.02 cells have the promising results for the battery applications.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,10.1515/teme-2021-0141
Crystallization kinetics and blue-light fluorescence characteristics of transparent ZnO-Ga2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramics containing ZnGa2O4 nanocrystals,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.SiO2-Ga2O3–ZnO–Al2O3–NaF–Na2O glasses with different Ga/Zn molar ratios have been prepared by the melt-quenching method, and glass-ceramics have been prepared by “one-step” controlled crystallization. The crystallization kinetics, crystal structure, and fluorescence properties of glass-ceramics with different Ga/Zn molar ratios have been studied by DSC, XRD, TEM, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The single-crystal phase with ZnGa2O4 spinel structure was precipitated in the glass-ceramics, and the grain size decreases from ∼87 nm to ∼6 nm with Ga2O3 replacing ZnO. The prepared ZnGa2O4 glass-ceramics can produce fluorescence emission in the boundary of 350–650 nm, and the emission peak shape changes significantly with the change of Ga/Zn molar ratios.

Effect of Printing Velocity on the Microscopic Void Distribution of 3D-Printed Short-Fiber-Reinforced Composites,"© 2022, ASM International.Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is gradually being widely used in the field of composite materials manufacturing, especially for short carbon fiber (SCF)-reinforced composites. In this paper, the effect of printing velocity on the microscopic void distribution of 3D-printed SCF/PA6 composites was explored. The high-resolution X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) was employed to quantitate the internal morphological characteristics. The internal voids of the samples including the independent voids and connected voids were quantitatively counted, respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that the proportion of internal voids increased with the increasing of the printing velocity. The number of independent voids increased firstly and then fell, and the connected voids gradually became the main existence form. By comparison, higher proportion of internal voids led to the lower compressive modulus. This is because the voids were more easily compacted, resulting in weak out-of-plane compressive resistance.",Journal of Failure Analysis and Prevention,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2022.103516
Light-sheet fluorescence microscopic probing of silicate materials Lichtschichtfluoreszenzmikroskopische Untersuchung von Silikatmaterialien,"© 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is a powerful method for 3D characterization of fluorescent samples. In this contribution we introduce the technique for the application in material analytics by demonstrating the 3D imaging of Ce3+-doped YAG (Y3Al5O12) crystals isolated in a glass matrix. When excited with short wavelength laser radiation, the Ce3+ doping enables fluorescence in the wavelength range between about 450 nm and 680 nm. Since the excitation wavelengths of Ce3+ in the YAG and glass phases of the glass ceramic differ substantially, a suitable laser wavelength can be used to excite only the YAG phase. Thus, an imaging contrast to the surrounding glass matrix is generated. We exploit the crystal dendrites for monitoring the image contrast and improve it by a deconvolution operation of the images. This field of application of LSFM offers great potential, e. g. for fundamental understanding of the microstructuring processes in silicate glasses.",Technisches Messen,10.1016/j.engstruct.2022.114212
Mono-crystalline Nanometer High Cristobalite Glass-ceramics from Nominal Pyroxene Glass,"© 2021, Springer Nature B.V.Transparent glass was prepared from nominal alkali pyroxene (Na2MgSi2O6) composition. The results showed that the incorporation of Cr2O3 in alkali pyroxene composition with 0.5 and 1.0 wt% increased the crystallization temperature of high cristobalite. High cristobalite was developed alone in all glass samples heat-treated at 800 °C. The microstructure shows nanometer crystals of high cristobalite which spread in glassy matrix. The density, hardness and coefficient of thermal expansion were between 2.49 and 2.53 g/cm3, 505 and 611 kg/mm2 and between 9.38 and 13.32 × 10− 6 °C− 1 (30–300 ˚C ), respectively for the three glass-ceramic compositions. All the samples have moderate to excellent antimicrobial activity on both gram positive bacteria (Staphyllococus aureus ) and pathogenic fungal yeast (Candida albicans), which show broad spectrum antimicrobial activity toward bacteria and fungi, while the sample NMCr1 has an excellent antifungal activity only toward the pathogenic fungal yeast (Candida albicans), which was described as a promising antifungal agent.",Silicon,10.1007/s10971-022-05786-0
"Effect of Fe2O3 on the crystallization behavior, microstructure and properties of glass-ceramics prepared from the modified tailings after reduction of copper slag","© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe modified tailings containing Fe2O3 after reduction of copper slag were used as the raw materials for the preparation of gehlenite-based glass-ceramics. The effect of Fe2O3 content on the crystallization behavior, microstructure and mechanical properties of glass-ceramics were investigated by Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS). The results show that when the Fe2O3 content increases from 0 wt% to 4 wt%, the crystallization peak temperature of base glass decreases and the crystallization activation energy of base glass decreases firstly and then increases. The minimum crystallization activation energy is 237.71 kJ/mol when the Fe2O3 content in base glass is 1 wt%, resulting from the highest content of glass modifier [FeO6]-octahedral in the glass. The crystallization index indicates that the crystallization method of base glass is surface crystallization, irrespective of the Fe2O3 contents of the base glass. Although the crystallization rate is slow resulting from the limited crystallization sites provided by Fe2O3, the glass-ceramics with 2 wt% Fe2O3 has a good comprehensive performance. When the nucleation process is at 850 ℃ for 120 min and the crystallization process is at 980 ℃ for 120 min, the flexural strength, microhardness, volume density and water absorption of the glass-ceramics with 2 wt% Fe2O3 are 138.26 MPa, 872.19 HV, 2.81 g/cm3 and 0.16%, respectively.",Materials Today Communications,10.1007/s11664-022-09589-5
Tensile behaviour of CFRP-glass adhesively bonded connections: double-lap joint tests and numerical modelling,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdWithin the context of glass structures, reinforcement strategies have been recently developed to prevent catastrophic failures by promoting the composite action between components. In this regard, the behaviour of adhesively bonded connections between glass and the reinforcement plays a crucial role. This paper presents an experimental, analytical and numerical study focussing on the bond behaviour of CFRP-to-glass adhesively bonded joints, comprising annealed glass sheets and CFRP laminates bonded with two stiff adhesives and one flexible adhesive. The experimental programme included (i) mechanical characterization tests and (i) tensile tests on CFRP-to-glass double-lap joints, evaluating the influence of the type of adhesive and the overlap length. Digital image correlation (DIC) method, analytical investigations and numerical modelling were performed to determine the local bond stress-slip laws for each adhesive, aiming at providing the required information to subsequently support the design of glass structural elements. Compared to the flexible adhesive, the stiff adhesives seem to promote more favourable interaction between the adherends; however, the former is better at promoting stress redistribution mechanisms, therefore, mobilizing longer bond lengths to transfer the tensile force between adherends. Adhesives with an extremely stiff response induce high stress concentrations in small areas and, consequently, the bonding system may fail prematurely at the glass adherend governed by localized phenomena, such as the low quality of glass processing methods, the high density of surfaces flaws and localized damage during handling.",Engineering Structures,10.1002/batt.202200041

Optimization of Heat Treatment and Cu Ions Additions to Enhance Optical and Photoluminescence Properties of Transparent Mica Glass Ceramic,"© 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.A set of mica glasses containing copper ions were synthesized using melt quenching technique with the chemical composition Na(1 − X)CuxMg3AlSi3O10F2, where X = 0, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.1. The samples were crystallized at temperatures obtained by differential thermal analysis (DTA) data. X-ray analysis confirmed the crystallization of mica (NaAl3Si3O11), MgF2 and pyrope (Mg3Al2Si3O12). Transparent glass ceramic with nano-sized crystal < 15 nm was obtained after heat treatment at 550°C/4 h+650°C/0.5 h. The characteristic peaks of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for glass and glass ceramic were due to the SiO4 group. The optical properties were investigated using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra. The optical band gap energies for glasses were also calculated, revealing Eopt =1.9 for X = 0 and increased to 3.45 eV for X = 0.1, i.e., located in the semiconductor range.

Ionic Conductivity versus Particle Size of Ball-Milled Sulfide-Based Solid Electrolytes: Strategy Towards Optimized Composite Cathode Performance in All-Solid-State Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Batteries & Supercaps published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.For the fabrication of high-energy and high-power all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs), easily synthesizable solid electrolytes are needed, which enable fast ion transport inside the composite cathode as well as good contacts between cathode active material and solid electrolyte particles. Regarding the latter, the size ratio of the particles inside the composite cathode has to be optimized. Here, we use a wet ball milling process for the synthesis of agyrodite-type Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 solid electrolyte particles and study the influence of milling time on particle size and ionic conductivity. With longer milling time, both the solid electrolyte particle size and the ionic conductivity decrease, which exert an opposing influence on the cathode performance. We show that a milling time of approximately 2 h leads to an optimum cathode performance, as this time is sufficient for a favorable particle size ratio, while a strong drop of the ionic conductivity of Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 is avoided.",Batteries and Supercaps,10.1007/s10904-022-02295-z
High-Resolution X-Ray Time-Lapse Imaging from Fluoride Nanocrystals Embedded in Glass Matrix,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.A latent image of the target after the X-ray irradiation induced via a 980 nm laser or thermal excitation provides great potentials for healthcare diagnostics and nondestructive inspection. Taking the advantage of X-ray time-lapse imaging, simplified facilities and visualized information can be achieved. However, information acquisition with higher resolution, combined with long-term storage for the corresponding X-ray images remains a challenge. Herein, Tb3+-doped Ba2LaF7 nanocrystals (NCs) grown in situ and dispersed uniformly in an amorphous glass matrix is explored, which performs a fascinating X-ray response for imaging with an impressive spatial resolution reaching 20.0 lp mm−1. Moreover, the as-developed corresponding scintillators exhibit excellent optical storage capability upon X-ray irradiation for the constructed deep traps, and a controllable release of the captured carriers induced by thermal disturbance, and 980 nm laser stimulation can be achieved. Notably, the imaging resolution is well preserved to be 20.0 lp mm−1 even recorded after 10 days. The as-explored Ba2LaF7:Tb3+ NCs embedded within an amorphous matrix realize a feasible approach for a simplified X-ray imaging system with high-resolution information production.",Advanced Optical Materials,10.1016/j.compstruct.2022.115490
Fabrication of magnetostrictive composites using metallic glass as glue,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdWith the continuous expansion of the applications in complex environments, magnetostrictive materials are required to possess not only high performance but also tunable performance. A promising way to achieve this goal is to form composites by combining two or more materials together. However, high performance magnetostrictive composites are still rare, in particular, in a pure metallic form. In this work, we develop a facile and efficient method by using metallic glass as glue, to fabricate pure metallic magnetostrictive composites with high and tunable performance. The Terfenol-D/metallic glass magnetostrictive composites are obtained by a unique thermoplastic forming method under a low temperature (480 K), small stress (114 MPa) and short time (3 min), which exhibit a relatively large field induced magnetostriction (∼650 ppm under a magnetic field of 30 kOe) and compressive strength (∼185 MPa). Thus, this work provides a promising strategy to design new magnetostrictive materials as well as other metal matrix composites with particular properties.",Intermetallics,10.1016/j.jlumin.2022.118834

A comprehensive review on structural joining techniques in the marine industry,"© 2022 The AuthorsExposure to aggressive environmental conditions and specific loads necessitate precise material selection and manufacturing techniques. Techniques such as overlamination, welding, adhesive bonding, mechanical joining, and hybrid joining are currently used to join different marine structures components. This review groups the published investigations to cover a wide range of geometries, materials, and loading types and organizes them in a chronological context. Comparing joining methods shows that each technique has a considerable potential to be employed in the various marine industry sectors corresponding to the desired application. Besides the significant strength, poor fatigue life is a concerning issue for welding. One of the most crucial challenges in mechanical fastening is drilling holes in composite materials that damages the fibres. Adhesive bonding provides superior advantages such as higher strength to weight ratio and fatigue life, whilst the susceptibility to environmental conditions must be considered. To overcome the drawbacks of each approach, the hybrid joining technique is introduced which combines two different joining methods to achieve the optimum performance. To have the most durable, and reliable structure, major criteria such as the structure application, the fabrication process, and the tolerance of adverse environment must be considered to design the marine structures.",Composite Structures,10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.106910
Color-tunable luminescence and temperature sensing in Ce3+/Tb3+ co-doped transparent oxyfluoride glass-ceramics containing Na1.5Y2.5F9 nanocrystals,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transparent glass-ceramics (GCs) containing Na1.5Y2.5F9 nanocrystals doped with Ce3+/Tb3+ were synthesized by melt-quenching approach. The nanocrystal structure was determined by X-ray diffraction, and its distribution and morphology were observed by transmission electron microscope. Luminous characteristics, energy transfer, and temperature sensing performance were investigated. Under 312 nm light excitation, the Ce3+/Tb3+ co-doped Na1.5Y2.5F9 GCs exhibited a blue emission (Ce3+: 424 nm) and sensitized a green emission (Tb3+: 546 nm). The emission color can be adjusted from blue (0.1643, 0.0826) to green (0.2891, 0.5243) via adding Tb3+ ions. The energy transfer efficiencies from Ce3+ to Tb3+ can reach 33.3%. The temperature sensitivity of sample Na1.5Y2.5F9: 0.5Ce3+, 0.1 Tb3+ and sample Na1.5Y2.5F9: 0.5Ce3+, 1.0 Tb3+ were compared. Based on the fluorescence intensity ratio of the Ce3+ and Tb3+ emission, the absolute sensitivity, relative sensitivity, temperature resolution, and thermal repeatability were estimated to be 0.768% K−1, 0.603% K−1, 0.049 K, and 0.993, respectively. The results indicate that Na1.5Y2.5F9: Ce3+, Tb3+ GCs have immense application prospects for multicolor displays and temperature sensors.",Journal of Luminescence,10.1007/s10971-022-05743-x
Damage mechanisms assessment of Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) composites using multivariable analysis methods applied to acoustic emission data,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThis work presents a coupling between three multivariable analysis techniques (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means and Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (KSOM)) applied to the acoustic emission data recorded on Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) composite materials in order to monitor and identify, in real-time, their damage mechanisms: matrix cracking, interfacial debonding, fiber breakage and delamination between layers. Two mechanical loadings were used during this study: a monotonic tensile test until the failure and a step-wise tensile test of 50 MPa each time (7 ramps and 6 levels of 4 min holding time). The first loading, applied to the specimens in pure epoxy resin, unidirectional (UD) [0]4 and [90]4 GFRP, as well as the laminates [0/90]S, allowed to evaluate the acoustic signature of each damage mechanism and establish a physical learning basis. The obtained physical data were employed for the learning operation of the Kohonen map which will be used for the identification of the damage mechanisms according to the level of the applied loading in the gradual tensile test. Post-mortem inspections conducted on the fracture facies of tested specimens under SEM confirmed the relevance of this {multivariable statistical analysis/acoustic emission} coupling for the detection and identification of GFRP damage mechanisms. Thus, the results of this study showed the relevance to identifying the damage mechanisms generated in a GFRP material by using multivariable acoustic emission analysis and provided a real potential for damage identification that would be developed in composite structures, made with the same material, under in-service loadings.",Composite Structures,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121540
Introduction of the developable surface concept in fibrous composite materials,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdComposite sheet forming, especially thermo-forming, has been well researched over the last few decades. However, the concept of developable surfaces has not been implemented for the fibrous composites. These surfaces form critical and lucrative aspects in geometric designs, surface analyses and structural applications, with their roots being strongly established in origami and various shape designs around the world. The current work aims to analytically derive and determine developable (de) curvatures on a flat sheet, based on established theories on lines of curvature. The theoretically derived de curves are then validated by metallic sheet forming before implementing them for the first time on both multi-layered wood veneers and short flax-fibre reinforced polypropylene composites.

Transparent oxyfluoride glass-ceramics obtained by different sol-gel routes,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Oxyfluoride glass-ceramics (OxGC) present attractive optical properties suitable for many applications. The incorporation of fluoride crystals into silicate matrices improves the luminescence properties, producing materials appropriate for photonic applications. Many papers focus on the preparation of oxyfluoride glass ceramics by melting quenching (MQ), the most widely utilized process. However, in the last decades, the sol-gel process has gained increasing interest as an alternative method for avoiding the MQ drawbacks. The first sol-gel route for producing glass-ceramics with rare earth (RE) doped fluoride nanocrystals were based on the preparation and further mixing of two separate sols. The crystallization of the fluoride nanoparticles occurs during the controlled thermal treatment. More recently, a new sol-gel strategy was proposed, based on the previous synthesis of aqueous fluoride nanoparticles suspensions that are subsequently dispersed in a silica sol-gel matrix. This paper summarizes the most relevant results as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each route and their limitations for future industrial scale up. The synthesis routes are compared considering the structural and morphological characterization, elucidating the crystallization mechanisms, and evaluating the optical properties of the resulting materials. Particular attention is paid to the possibility of producing transparent oxyfluoride glass ceramics films with improved luminescence and enhanced optical properties.

Experimental analysis and modeling of the Knoop hardness of lithium disilicate glass-ceramics containing lithium tantalate as a secondary phase,© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The present study examines the Knoop hardness (HK) via microindentation of lithium disilicate (LD) glass-ceramics that contain lithium tantalate (LT) as a secondary phase. A 64-sample data set was analyzed to study the relationship between the phase assemblage and the mechanical property. It was found that the HK was dependent on the phase assemblage in a similar manner as previously acquired phase and color data on the same system. The HK data was used to train a linear model to predict the heat treatment needed to acquire a desired HK value. The model allowed us to identify that LT is the best phase to increase the hardness of the sample per XRD count.,Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.132023
High immobilizing capacity of natural granite as glass-ceramic matrix to simulated trivalent actinide waste,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdOne kind of natural granite was selected as matrix for loading simulated trivalent actinide waste (Nd2O3) in an attempt to solve the two major problems of nuclear waste and granite waste simultaneously. The results show that the introduced waste ion plays an important role in the structure change of the matrix. After traditional sintering at 1300 °C for 60 min, the granite was a glass-ceramic structure without nuclear waste doping. With 10 mass % of waste doping, the introduced Nd3+ entered the final waste form, the bulk transformed to completely vitrified. With further waste doping, Nd3+ also entered into the crystal lattice and Nd related compounds grew gradually. Nd was uniformly distributed in the final waste form under the maximum doping amount (76 mass %) in the natural granite. The final waste form has enhanced physical stability. The Vickers hardness and density of the samples increased from 6.79 to 10.08 GPa and from 2.11 to 4.13 g cm−3 with the doping of Nd2O3, respectively. This may be a potential way to dispose both granite waste and nuclear waste.",Radiation Physics and Chemistry,10.1007/s10443-022-10024-5
"Preparation, structure and luminescence properties of Ce3+ activated translucent glass ceramics containing garnet microcrystals","© 2022Glass ceramics containing Ce3+ doped garnet microcrystals were prepared from the spontaneous crystallization of SiO2-Al2O3-Y2O3-MgO-BaO-CeF3 glass melt. The formation of Ce3+:(Y,Mg)3(Al,Si)5O12 grains in the glass matrix were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and photoluminescence spectra. The transmittance of samples improves with higher melting temperature or increasing BaO/MgO ratio, while the Ce3+: 5d → 4f emission intensity weakens monotonously. Besides, the transmittance declines sharply after being heat treated above 950°C, which is originated from the schistose BaAl2Si2O8 microcrystals in the glass matrix. The optimized sample with composition of 40SiO2-16Al2O3-8Y2O3-24BaO-12MgO-0.3CeF3 was chosen to construct a white LED device, which yields bright white light with luminous efficiency of 23.6 lm/W, correlated color temperature of 5260 K and Ra of 85.5. It indicates that the investigated glass ceramics can be a promising color converter for white LEDs.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.cscm.2021.e00805
Highly conductive and stretching-insensitive transparent electrodes based on CuNWs,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Flexible transparent electrode is attracting a lot of attention for various applications due to their versatile ability. However, it is still challenging to apply transparent electrode in stretchable application, because the conductivity will be degraded even lost when the electrode is stretched. Here, a high-performance transparent electrode with stretching-insensitivity is reported. The electrode is obtained by embedding copper nanowires into wrinkled polydimethylsiloxane elastomers via using simple sol–gel transition. The resulting electrode exhibits low sheet resistance of 16 Ω/sq. at an acceptable transmittance of ∼ 74% at visible region, and tensile stability under below 210% strain. In particular, the resistance is almost unchanged after 2500 stretching cycles with a strain of 70%, indicating excellent stretching-insensitively.",Materials Letters,10.1016/j.jlumin.2022.118824
An Investigation into the Forming of Fiber Metal Laminates with Different Thickness Metal Skins Using Hydromechanical Deep Drawing,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.Lightweight composite materials are being extensively used in the aerospace and marine industry, considering environmental concerns. Fiber metal laminates are one such material that is an answer to the stringent requirement of global ecological concern, along with the capacity to overcome the environmental degradation of monolithic metallic alloys. In this paper, glass laminate aluminum reinforced epoxy (GLARE) in 2/1 configuration consisting of aluminum 2024-T3 with E-glass plain weave fiber prepreg was prepared by hand layup technique in a semi-cured state for carrying out experimental observations. Al skins of different thickness 0.3 mm upper skin and 0.5 mm lower skin were selected considering geometric shape of the required part and forming process for better formability. Hydromechanical deep drawing of the different thickness Al layers in GLARE 2/1 configuration has shown a reduction in overall laminates weight compared to the symmetric GLARE 2/1 laminates having both 0.5 mm upper and lower Al skins, with a considerable depth of the cup-shaped part. The surface treatment, blank holder gap, blank holder force, and die cavity pressure are dominant parameters in fabricating a defect-free part, where predominantly surface treatment contributes to failure due to delamination during forming of GLARE. Other parameters such as blank holder gap, blank holder force and cavity pressure were evaluated using Taguchi L9 orthogonal array method and numerical simulations using Abaqus FEA code which was in close agreement with the experimental observations.",Applied Composite Materials,10.1016/j.oooo.2022.01.007
TiO2-based glass-ceramic coatings: An innovative approach to architectural panel applications,"© 2021 The AuthorsExterior claddings are used for architectural purposes primarily for practical and esthetic reasons. Panels are subjected to a variety of impacts, including chemical, and ultraviolet radiation, and are intended to survive them. In this study, the color, gloss, chemical and UV resistance, impact resistance, and surface tension of glass-ceramic (GC) coated steel panels and other products on the market, such as conventional ceramic wall tiles, glass, and aluminum panels, are compared. Three different types of GC powders were prepared: opaque, semi-transparent, and transparent. Each GC powder was applied to a pre-coated steel substrate. Chemical resistance was excellent in all samples, however, only the GC-coated steel panels and the aluminum panels satisfied the impact resistance criteria. A UV test was performed to ensure that surface characteristics such as gloss, color, and surface tension were stable in the presence of UV light. The aluminum gives alerts the most color shift (∆E ≈ 1.2), whereas the GC-coated steel panels showed just ∆E ≈ 0.2. The gloss values of the samples did not change significantly much. Furthermore, when compared to the other products, GC-coated samples had the lowest weight and the greatest performance.",Case Studies in Construction Materials,10.1007/s40870-022-00330-1
Luminescence properties and thermal stability of Dy3+/Eu3+co-doped single-component BaZn2(PO4)2 glass-ceramic phosphors,"© 2022Highly thermally stable BaZn2(PO4)2: Dy3+/Eu3+ glass-ceramic (GC) phosphors were synthesized using a high-temperature solid-state reaction and controlled-temperature pre-crystallization method. It is found that Dy3+-doped BaZn2(PO4)2 GC phosphors produce cold white light emission at 484 nm and 575 nm under 350 nm excitation with the optimal Dy3+ doping concentration of 0.25 mol%. The theoretical analysis indicates that the dipole-dipole interaction might be the origin of the concentration quenching mechanism of phosphor. The Eu3+-doped BaZn2(PO4)2 GC phosphors produce orange-red emission at 592, 616, 654 and 700 nm under 395 nm excitation. More than that, tunable white light emission can be achieved by optimize the co-doped concentration of Eu3+ on BaZn2(PO4)2: 0.25Dy3+ GC phosphor. The emission spectral intensity and luminescence decay curves from BaZn2(PO4)2: 0.25Dy3+/yEu3+ (range of y) GC phosphors show the energy transfer from Dy3+ to Eu3+ and the emission color can be tuned from cool white to warm white region with the color correlated temperatures (CCTs) reduction from 7299 K to 2520 K. The typical BaZn2(PO4)2: 0.25Dy3+/1Eu3+ GC phosphors have a high thermal stability with an activation energy of 0.30641 eV. Finally, the white LED devices were fabricated by coupling a 363 nm UV light-emitting diode chip with the BaZn2(PO4)2: 0.25Dy3+/yEu3+ GC phosphors. These results suggest that BaZn2(PO4)2: Dy3+/Eu3+ GC phosphors may be suitable candidates for single-component white light-emitting phosphors for application in UV-WLEDs.",Journal of Luminescence,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.02.157
Impact of different fixed dental prostheses on radiation dose in helical tomotherapy as measured with metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor dosimetry,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Objective: This ex vivo study evaluated the effects of different fixed dental prostheses and protective materials on scattered radiation during radiation therapy (RT). Study Design: Natural teeth (group NT) and 4 types of prostheses (group BL: bilayer lithium disilicate glass-ceramic; group MZ: monolithic zirconia ceramic; group BZ: bilayer zirconia-based all ceramic; and group BM: bilayer metal-ceramic restorations) were examined in maxillary and mandibular arch phantoms. All groups were divided into 3 subgroups: (1) without protective material over the prostheses; (2) protected with a soft acrylic night guard; and (3) protected with polyvinylsiloxane putty. All groups were irradiated with helical RT at 2 Gy and 6 MV photon energy. Doses were measured internally and externally 3 times on each phantom. Results were significant at P < .05. Results: No statistically significant differences in doses were found between groups NT and BL in either phantom, but these groups were different from the others. The differences between groups BZ and MZ were insignificant. Doses in group BM were significantly larger than all other groups. No significant differences existed between doses with and without protective material. Conclusions: Doses increased significantly due to scattered radiation from the prostheses with increasing material density. Protective materials had no significant effect on dose.","Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology and Oral Radiology",10.1016/j.mtcomm.2022.103316
Loading Mode and Lateral Confinement Dependent Dynamic Fracture of a Glass Ceramic Macor,"© 2022, The Author(s).A systematic comparison of the tensile and compressive response of glass ceramic Macor, with zero porosity and low density, is carried out by using flattened Brazilian disk and cylindrical specimen from quasi-static to dynamic loading conditions. The experiments were performed on a screw driven Zwick machine and an in-house built split Hopkinson bar synchronized with a high speed photographic system. Likewise, the loading rate dependent fracture toughness is also investigated by using a notched semi-circular Brazilian disk. A digital image correlation technique is adopted to assist in the monitoring of strain field, crack initiation and propagation under dynamic loading conditions. Both tensile and compressive strength show loading rate dependencies, however, the static and dynamic tensile strengths are only 20% of the compressive strengths without confinement and less than 10% of the confined compressive strength. The microstructural characterization reveals the fracture mechanisms in unconfined Macor are predominantly transgranular with mica platelets and cleavage planes, which are influenced by the loading mode and loading rate. However, the Macor with confinement shows ductile fracture micrographs with a shear localization zone consisting of fine particles. With the use of Macor ceramic as a model material, the paper presents an economical approach to investigate the loading mode and pressure dependent failure of ceramic materials. This will support the characterization of dynamic properties of current and future developed advanced ceramics for demanding applications in the aero engine.",Journal of Dynamic Behavior of Materials,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.02.105
"NaLaMo2O8:Yb3+, Er3+ transparent glass ceramics: Up-conversion luminescence and temperature sensitivity property","© 2022A novel transparent Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped NaLaMo2O8 glass ceramics (GCs) with borosilicate glass as the matrix were prepared via glass melting and subsequent controlled crystallization method, and the light transmission property, phase structure, microstructure and up-conversion (UC) performance were characterized by XRD, TEM, transmittance spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectrum. A decrease in the lattice parameter of NaLaMo2O8 in GC sample was verified by XRD Rietveld method, indicating the successful incorporation of Yb3+/Er3+ ions in the Na/La-site of NaLaMo2O8 phase. The UC emission intensity of transparent GCs was significantly enhanced compared to precursor glass. The green light emission in the UC is a three-photon absorption process. The 2.0Yb3+/0.1Er3+(mol%) co-doped GC sample shows the maximum absolute sensitivity of 1.406% K−1 at 473 K, which implies that the as-prepared GC exhibits potential application prospects in the field of optical temperature sensing.",Ceramics International,10.1177/15280837211067281
"Crystallization behavior and properties of non-stoichimetric cordierite glass–ceramics: Effects of talc, MgO/SiO2 ratio, and Al2O3 content","© 2022 Elsevier LtdNon-stoichimetric cordierite glass-ceramics were obtained by powder sintering method, using talc mineral as sintering aid. Effects of talc, MgO/SiO2(M/S) ratio and Al2O3 content on the crystallization behavior, densification behavior, physical properties and thermal expansion coefficients of the glass-ceramics were investigated. Results showed that, 15 wt% talc addition reduced the crystallization temperature of cordierite in the glass-ceramics from 1085 °C to 1052.2 °C by increasing the M/S ratio. Adding talc decreased the Al2O3 content and provided alkali oxides to promote the liquid formation. The decreasing Al2O3 content from 30.47 wt% to 21.67 wt% resulted in the dissolution–reprecipitation–recrystallization–redissolution process of cordierite due to the enhancing liquid formation. Adding talc could decrease the thermal expansion coefficient by increasing the cordierite content, and the low thermal expansion coefficient of 1.90 × 10−6 ℃−1 was obtained. The decreasing Al2O3 content promoted the densification behavior, but increased the thermal expansion coefficient of the glass-ceramics by increasing the amount of glass. The sample having the 15 wt% talc addition and the lowest Al2O3 content of 21.67 wt% obtained the low porosity of 0.3%, which was much lower than 25.1% of the original sample without talc addition.",Materials Today Communications,10.1111/jace.18350
Development of ceramic fiber reinforced glass ceramic sealants for microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Ceramic fibers in various forms with different fiber sizes are tested to improve the sealing performance of glass ceramic seals for microtubular solid oxide fuel cell applications. In this regard, several sealing pastes are prepared by mixing each ceramic fibers type with glass ceramics at 1.25 wt %. Five layered microtubular anode supported cells are also fabricated by extrusion and dip coating methods to evaluate the sealing performance of the composite sealants. The pastes are applied between the cells and gas manifolds made of Crofer22 APU. The electrochemical and sealing performances at an operating temperature of 800 °C under hydrogen are investigated after the glass forming process. Microstructures of the sealants are also examined by a scanning electron microscope. Experimental investigations reveal that the cells sealed by the pastes with ceramic bulk fiber and ceramic fiber rope gasket show acceptable open circuit potentials close to the theoretical one. These cells can be also pressurized up to around 150 kPa back pressure in the sealing performance tests. On the other hand, the pastes without any filler, with ceramic rope and with ceramic blanket exhibit poor sealing performance due to gas leakage originated from flowing of the main glass ceramic matrix from the joints. Therefore, ceramic bulk fiber and ceramic fiber rope gasket are found to behave as a stopper and can be used to prevent glass ceramics from flowing for microtubular solid oxide fuel cells or similar applications.",Ceramics International,10.1111/jace.18357
Study on characterization of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) novel natural fiber as reinforcement with epoxy polymer matrix material for lightweight applications,"© The Author(s) 2022.In this study, the primary goal is to utilize the biological waste of water hyacinth (Eihhornia crassipes) plant fiber–reinforced polymer composite materials for commercial applications, especially for lightweight materials aspects. In this work, the physical, mechanical (tensile, flexural, and impact), thermal, and morphological properties of water hyacinth natural fiber composite samples are investigated. We strongly believe that only a minimum amount of work has to be done to this water hyacinth fiber composite oriented. Especially all the previous literature reported the hyacinth fibers are extracted from the retting process and manual method. But, in this work, hyacinth fibers are extracted from the new novel mechanical way of the extraction process. From the results of chemical analysis, water hyacinth fiber contains a very high 62.15% cellulose content and a minimum amount (14.82%) of hemicellulose content. The crystallinity index of water hyacinth fiber composite is 54.82%. The surface of the hyacinth composite is examined with the help of a scanning electron microscope. The thermal degradation of hyacinth fiber composite is measured with the help of the thermogravimetric analysis method. Based on the final experimental results, the water hyacinth natural fiber composite is the better alternative for other traditional fiber composites and it is strongly recommended for lightweight material applications.",Journal of Industrial Textiles,10.1177/15280837211062053
Investigation of microscale fracture mechanisms in glass–ceramics using peridynamics simulations,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.Glass–ceramics (GCs), obtained by controlled crystallization of a specially formulated precursor glass, are interesting materials that show great promise in obtaining superior properties compared to those of the precursor glass. Controlled crystallization enables creation of a microstructure with multiple phases which impacts macroscale properties in interesting ways. The present work develops microstructure-scale computational models using the theory of peridynamics to investigate the increase in fracture toughness of GCs compared to traditional glass. Computational modeling is a promising tool to probe microstructural mechanics, but such studies in the literature are scarce. In this work, the theory of peridynamics, a non-local theory of continuum mechanics, is applied to simulate crack propagation through microstructural realizations of a model lithium-disilicate glass–ceramic. The crystalline and glassy phases within the microstructure are explicitly considered, with the size and shape of crystals inspired by experimental data. Multiple toughening mechanisms are revealed, which are functions of crystallinity and morphology, and the impact on fracture toughness is demonstrated. Crack path tortuosity is studied, and it is found that an optimum level of crack path tortuosity can be obtained in the range of 0.6–0.8 crystallinity. Numerical results are shown to agree well with previously published experimental and modeling results.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1007/s12633-021-01226-w
Low thermal expansion ZBLAN-based glass ceramics containing CaZrF6 crystals,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.Fluoride glass is considered as an excellent optical material owing to its ultralow phonon energy (578 cm−1). However, its high thermal expansion coefficient (15.87 × 10−6/K) and deformability severely limit applications under service environments with high temperature, high humidity, and high-power irradiation. To overcome these limitations, we developed a ZBLAN-based fluoride glass ceramics (CZBLAN GCs) contained the negative thermal expansion material-CaZrF6 crystals by phase-separation engineering. The ability to control the precipitation of the desired crystal phase was achieved by adequate compositional design for phase separation, yielding improved or new properties in the development of fluoride GCs. With the successful precipitation of very uniformly dispersed single CaZrF6 crystals in the glass phase (up to ∼40% crystallinity), a significantly lower thermal expansion coefficient (3.66 × 10−6/K) in the fluoride system was achieved. Moreover, enhanced fluorescence properties of Eu-doped CZBLAN GCs were observed compared with those of Eu-doped ZBLAN glass owing to the lower phonon energy in GCs.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/jerd.12675
Effects of drilling parameters on delamination of kenaf-glass fibre reinforced unsaturated polyester composites,"© The Author(s) 2021.Drilling is a secondary material removal and usually carried out to facilitate fastening of parts together. Drilling of composite materials is not usually a problem-free process. Issues related to delamination composite laminates need to be addressed because it introduces the stress concentration point on the composite. This study focussed on the influence of process parameters such as spindle speed, feed rate, type of drill bits and geometry on the extend of delamination experienced by the composite during the drilling process of kenaf-glass fibre-reinforced unsaturated polyester composite, and the delamination measurements were taken under a microscope. Taguchi methods and analysis of variance were employed to find the optimal parameters. From the results, the most significant parameter was the feed rate. The minimum delamination was achieved when the feed rate was 0.05 mm/rev and spindle speed was 700r/min using both types of drill bits. The quality of the drill hole using the twist drill bit has been proven to be better than the brad drill bit.",Journal of Industrial Textiles,10.1088/1742-6596/2270/1/012009
Structural Role of Strontium Oxide in Modified Silicate Glasses,"© 2021, Springer Nature B.V.Glasses in the system 24.5Na2O.24.5CaO.6P2O5.xSrO.(45-x)SiO2 have been studied in the composition region of x = 0–15 mol%. The as-prepared glasses are transparent and have an amorphous network structure. On the other hand, heat-treated glasses are transformed to opaque white glass-ceramic characterized by their highly crystalline network structure. Crystalline apatite (calcium phosphate, Ca3(PO4)2), wollastonite (calcium silicate, CaSiO3), and strontium calcium phosphate [Ca2Sr (PO4)2) are the main well-formed crystalline species that played the major role in material bioactivity. Increasing SrO leads to enhancing material crystallite and enhances the hardness of the host glass matrix. The change of XRD spectra,31P NMR chemical shift, and hardness number upon increasing SrO are considered due to modification of the apatite Ca(PO3)2 to involve Sr ions inducing Ca2Sr (PO4)2 apatite one. Such species play the role in enhancing material properties and hardness.",Silicon,10.1922/EJPRD_2299Kolanko11
Comparison of marginal and internal fit of pressed lithium disilicate veneers fabricated via a manual waxing technique versus a 3D printed technique,"© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Objective: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the marginal and internal fit of pressed lithium disilicate veneers fabricated from a 3D printed castable wax resin versus a manual waxing technique. Materials and Methods: A typodont model central incisor was prepared for a porcelain veneer. Following stone model fabrication from a polyvinyl siloxane impression, the model was digitized using a laboratory scanner. Group 1 veneers were designed digitally and 3D printed with a castable wax resin, then pressed. Group 2 veneers were fabricated using a manual wax and press approach. Veneers from both groups were bonded to printed dies. Following measurements of marginal adaptation under a stereo microscope, the dies were sectioned and measurements were made for internal adaption. Statistical analysis included a Kolmogorov test and a Mann–Whitney U test. Results: Average marginal gap (μm) for Group 1 was 40.37 ± 11.75 and 50.63 ± 16.99 for Group 2 (p = 0.51). Average internal gap (μm) for Group 1 was 61.21 ± 18.20 and 68.03 ± 14.07 for Group 2 (p = 0.178). Conclusion: There was no difference in marginal fit or internal fit between pressed lithium disilicate veneers fabricated with a 3D printed castable resin and those fabricated with a manual waxing technique. The use of digital technologies and 3D printing provide significant advantages in the fabrication of pressed glass ceramic veneers, with marginal and internal adaptation comparable to manual wax and press techniques.",Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry,10.4271/2022-26-0004

Does Immediate Dentine Sealing Improve Bonding Effectiveness of Glass Ceramic Restorations Compared to Delayed Dentine Sealing?,"Copyright© 2022 Dennis Barber Ltd.A systematic review of the literature was conducted to determine whether immediate dentine sealing (IDS) or delayed dentine sealing (DDS) would lead to a more effective bond between dentine and indirect glass ceramic restorations. Bonding effectiveness was determined by assessing bond strength or force to fracture from the selected studies. This report followed the PRISMA Statement. A total of 10 articles were subsequently identified for inclusion. In vitro studies evaluating bond strength or force to fracture of etchable glass ceramic restorations, following a bonding protocol that incorporates IDS and DDS were eligible to be selected. Analysis has shown IDS creates a more effective bond between dentine and glass ceramic restorations compared with DDS in 9 out of 10 of the studies assessed. Bond effectiveness was judged using three outcomes; microtensile bond strength (μTBS), shear bond strength (SBS) and force to fracture. IDS was shown to increase μTBS and force to fracture, in all seven studies that assessed these outcomes. IDS was also shown to positively affect the SBS in 3 of the 4 studies that assessed SBS. Further clinical trials are now required to understand the significance of IDS in a clinical environment.",The European journal of prosthodontics and restorative dentistry,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164069
Tuning of Blade Natural Frequencies Outside High Excitation Region by using Ceramic Particle Reinforced Composite Materials for a Typical Gas Turbine Engine Compressor Blade,"© 2022 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.Composite materials have time and again proven to be highly useful, especially in the aerospace industry with the increasing need for light-weight materials albeit with high stiffness to strength ratios. The Ceramic Particle Reinforced Composites can be effectively utilized in tuning the natural frequencies of components by varying the volume fractions up to 40% with the help of Representative Volume Element (RVE) / Unit Cell Models as explained in Reference [1]. The aim of this paper is to tune the natural frequencies of a typical blade used in a gas turbine engine by modifying the material properties without changing the design profile significantly. The design profiles of blades are arrived at after a lot of engineering iterations from aerodynamics stability point of view and are also finalized based on meeting key performance parameters. However, the structural analysis studies are carried out after the profile generation, which may sometime predict that the natural frequencies are within the high excitation range of the engine. This adds to the risk of failure due to vibrational stresses caused by resonant frequencies where the vibration loads are higher in magnitude. Therefore, if the natural frequencies of the blades can be tuned in such a way that these do not lie within the high excitation frequency range, then it can save engineering costs and avoid rework in the design phase. In addition, it can help in saving the weight without compromising on the structural integrity of the blades. The studies will be performed using the commercial FE software (Ansys Workbench) by homogenizing the effective material properties and this will involve a direct comparison of natural frequencies and mode shapes with the existing metallic v. proposed composite material models.",SAE Technical Papers,10.1016/j.xcrp.2022.100871
Electromechanical characterization and kinetic energy harvesting of piezoelectric nanocomposites reinforced with glass fibers,"© 2022 The AuthorsPiezoelectric composites are a significant research field because of their excellent mechanical flexibility and sufficient stress-induced voltage. Furthermore, due to the widespread use of the Internet of Things (IoT) in recent years, small-sized piezoelectric composites have attracted a lot of attention. Also, there is an urgent need to develop evaluation methods for these composites. This paper evaluates the piezoelectric and mechanical properties of potassium sodium niobate (KNN)-epoxy and KNN-glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites using a modified small punch (MSP) and nanoindentation tests in addition to d33 measurements. An analytical solution for the piezoelectric composite thin plate under bending was obtained for the determination of the bending properties. Due to the glass fiber inclusion, the bending strength increased by about four times, and Young's modulus in the length direction increased by approximately two times (more than that of the KNN-epoxy); however, in the thickness direction, Young's modulus decreased by less than half. An impact energy harvesting test was then performed on the KNN-epoxy and KNN-GFRP composites. As a result, the output voltage of KNN-GFRP was larger than that of KNN-epoxy. Also, the output voltage was about 2.4 V with a compressive stress of 0.2 MPa, although the presence of the glass fibers decreased the piezoelectric constants. Finally, damped flexural vibration energy harvesting test was carried out on the KNN-epoxy and KNN-GFRP composites. The KNN-epoxy was broken during the test, however KNN-GFRP composite with a load resistance of 10 MΩ generated 35 nJ of energy. Overall, through this work, we succeeded in developing piezoelectric energy harvesting composite materials that can withstand impact and bending vibration using glass fibers and also established a method for evaluating the electromechanical properties with small test specimen.",Composites Science and Technology,10.1088/1742-6596/2235/1/012086
Dielectric dispersion impedance spectroscopy and polaron tunneling phenomenon in Au2O3 mixed PbO-B2O3-SeO2:Er2O3 glass ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The glass ceramics of the composition PbO-B2O3-SeO2:Er2O3 (PBSE) doped with small concentrations of Au2O3 were synthesized. The results of detailed studies on various characterization techniques and also different spectroscopic investigations suggested that these glass ceramics are entrenched with Au2(SeO3)3 crystal phases and Au0 metallic particles (MPs). These studies further revealed increasing concentration of [SeO3]2- groups and Au0 metallic particles with the increase of Au2O3 content upto 0.075 mol%. Such [SeO3]2- groups are predicted to induce structural imperfections in the glass ceramic. Optical absorption (OA) and photoluminescence (PL) spectral studies also indicated increasing concentration of imperfections with increase of Au2O3 content. The dielectric viz, dielectric permittivity (ε′), electrical modulus (M), electrical impedance (Z) and a.c. conductivity (σac) spectra in the frequency (ω) region 4 Hz to 8 MHz and in the temperature (T) region 303–633 K of these glass ceramic samples were measured as functions of Au2O3 concentration. The dielectric permittivity (ε′) exhibited an increasing trend with Au2O3 concentration and it is ascribed to the increase in the magnitude of the space charge polarization (scp) due to the increase in the concentration of structural defects induced by [SeO3]2- units and Au0 metallic particles. The plots of electric modulus (M) with frequency and temperature exhibited dipolar relaxation phenomena. Such effects were analyzed further using Cole-Cole diagrams and the possible dipoles responsible for these effects were identified. A.C. conductivity (σac) exhibited increasing trend with the concentration of Au2O3 (up to 0.075 mol%) and such increase is attributed to the polaronic exchange between different structural groups of selenium oxide. The conduction mechanism is analyzed using polaronic tunneling effect in the middle frequency and high temperature regions, whereas in the lower temperature region QMT model seems to be applicable. Conclusions drawn from dielectric properties were found to be well in accordance with the results of spectroscopic properties.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1039/d2ta02321k
Oxyfluoride glass-ceramics for upconversion all-optical combinational logic gate operations,"© 2022 The Author(s)All-optical logic gates operations are highly desired for optical communications and data processing because of the high computing speed, low power consumption, and parallel processing. Here, we develop a combinational upconversion (UC) all-optical logic system based on glass-ceramic (GC) material, which uses two external near-infrared excitation sources as inputs signal and UC emission as optical outputs. The prepared transparent oxyfluoride GC containing Er:NaYF4 nanocrystals could well respond to dual-wavelength excitation, realizing the enhancement of UC luminescence intensity and the adjustment of emission color based on the synergistic effect of photons. This special UC system can be used to design a variety of all-optical logic gates and combinational logic operations through observing the two luminescence emission intensities and the ratio of these emission intensities under the dual-wavelength excitation input conditions.

Dynamic Characteristics Analysis of a Coupled Multi-crack Rotor System,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.This paper establishes a coupled model for multi-crack rotor using Timoshenko beam element with six degrees of freedom, and derives the stiffness matrix in the equations of motion accounting for the coupling between multiple cracks (the interaction between cracks). Then the effects of crack orientation angles (the relative angle between cracks, β) on dynamic characteristics of the coupled multi-crack rotor near 1/3 and 1/2 subcritical speeds are analysed. The coupling between cracks induces more complex nonlinear dynamic characteristics such as large magnitudes of the super-harmonic components, which can be used as the indicators of early crack and for multi-crack identification. This work has a promotive significance for the application of the model-based method in the field of multi-crack detection of actual rotors.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.02.067
Debonding detection of scarf-repaired composite laminates with laser ultrasonic Lamb waves,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In this article, the Lamb wave at low frequency range is chosen to detect the debonding of scarf surface at different depths. The structure of interest is made up of two carbon fiber reinforced laminates with a scarf angle of 5° bonded together by an adhesive film. A 3D finite element model is established to calculate the propagation of Lamb waves with an artificial defect. Based on the wave front of out-of-plane displacement at different timepoint, the debonding area is located when propagating waves convert mode or reduce phase velocity. For validation, experiments are also conducted with wave-visualization technique. Lamb waves are excited by laser ultrasonic system and received by an acoustic emission sensor. The results agree with the simulation ones, which verify that the laser ultrasonic Lamb waves are effective for debond detection on the inclined plane of scarf-repaired composite laminates.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.01.355
Accelerated crystal growth in a lithia aluminosilicate glass,"© 2022 Acta Materialia Inc.No viscosity change in the vicinity of the crystal/melt interface is to be expected for crystal growth in silicate systems at constant temperature in a deeply undercooled isochemical melt. In most experimental studies, however, absolute chemical conformity is not realized and the formation of an interfacial zone with presumably strongly altered viscosity will occur. In the present investigation isolated Li2O⋅Al2O3⋅4SiO2 (LAS4) single crystals grew in a slightly alumina deficient base glass at temperatures above glass transition. Due to the depletion of alumina and the enrichment of excess components and impurities of the continuously growing interfacial zone (“shell”), its viscosity will change. Dedicated experiments showed that the viscosity of the interfacial zone is up to 7 orders of magnitude lower than the viscosity of the base glass. The decreased viscosity at the crystal growth front is assumed to cause the experimentally observed increase of the crystallisation velocity with the crystal radius. This behaviour can be quantitatively modelled introducing a linear decrease of the activation enthalpy with the crystal radius. Obviously, the proposed model can be likewise used in the opposite case, i.e. for an increasing viscosity of the interfacial zone during crystal growth. According to the standard concept of a fractional viscosity relation, a coupling factor can formally be extracted from the comparison between the experimentally determined activation enthalpies of the crystal growth velocity and of the base glass viscosity. The resulting unrealistically low numerical value indicates that it is not the high viscosity of the base glass, but the lower viscosity of the interfacial zone that must be considered for the determination of a physically meaningful coupling factor.",Acta Materialia,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121509
3D direct printing of composite bone scaffolds containing polylactic acid and spray dried mesoporous bioactive glass-ceramic microparticles,"© 2022In this study, a three-dimensional composite scaffold is proposed consisting of polylactic acid and spray dried glass-ceramic microparticles (SGCMs). The compositional and structural characterization showed that the obtained spray dried powder formed as glass-ceramic (GC) with a completely interconnected porosity structure. Before direct printing of scaffolds, the rheological behavior of polylactic acid (PLA) and PLA-GC (PLA matrix containing SGCMs) inks were investigated. The PLA-GC composite ink represents sharper shear-thinning behavior and higher loss and storage modulus comparable to that of pure PLA. Microscopic observations and elemental mapping elements showed that 3D scaffolds had well-defined interconnected porosity and uniform distribution of the glass-ceramic particles. Mechanical tests indicated that compression strength is dependent on the scaffold porosity and the presence of SGCMs. Apatite formation evaluation besides ion release study showed better biomineralization capacity of PLA-GC scaffolds, as larger and denser sediments formed on the PLA-GC scaffolds after 7- and 14-day soaking. The preliminary cell response was studied with primary human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and revealed that SGCMs improved cell adhesion and viability and ALP activity.

Refinement of ZnAl2O4 crystal in ZnO–Al2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramics by application of thermoelectric coupling field,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Transparent glass-ceramics based on ZnO–Al2O3–SiO2 (ZAS) glass system exhibit excellent optical and mechanical properties that are dependent on crystal grains. Gahnite (ZnAl2O4) was the main phase that crystallized in ZAS glass-ceramics via thermoelectric coupling treatment. The morphology and size of ZnAl2O4 crystal were controlled by the electric field strength. Introduction of thermoelectric coupling field led to the refinement and dispersion of large and agglomerated ZnAl2O4 crystal grains, which improved the transmission and Vickers’ hardness of the ZAS-based glass-ceramics. Theoretical calculations revealed that crystal phase is the area of low electric field strength, which resulted in the migration of Zn ions (Zn2+) from glass phase to the ZnAl2O4 crystal regions under the effect of thermoelectric coupling field. The decrease in the amount of Zn2+ in glass phase further limited its grain growth, and refinement of ZnAl2O4 grains was achieved. This research shows an efficient and rapid approach to refine grains in ZAS glass-ceramics by application of thermoelectric coupling treatment.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.01.282

Quantitative relationship between microstructure and optical properties of Er3+-Yb3+ co-doped glass-ceramics containing pyrochlore-type crystalline phases,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Er3+-Yb3+ co-doped transparent glass-ceramics (GCs) containing Y2Ti2O7 crystalline phase were prepared by the melting crystallization method. The qualitative relationship between light transmittance and three-dimensional structure parameters of glass-ceramic was studied according to the principle of stereology under different heat treatment conditions. As indicated by the research results, the light transmittance decreased with the increase in the equivalent spherical diameter (D3S) and specific surface area per unit volume of the grains (SV). However, the light transmittance increased linearly with the increase in the discrete grains (SVP) and the mean free distance (λ). The up-conversion luminescence intensity was found to be most vigorous under Er3+ and Yb3+ doping concentrations of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively, at 980 nm excitation. Considering the correlation between pump power and up-conversion emission intensity, the up-conversion luminescence mechanism was explored.

Polychromatic tunable luminescence of Eu3+ doped CsPbBr3 quantum dot glass ceramic induced by mechanical crystallization,"© 2022Nowadays, inorganic perovskite quantum dots (QDs) glass has become a hot topic in the field of new optical materials. In this work, the Eu3+ doped CsPbBr3 QDs phosphate glass has been successfully prepared. Different from the traditional heat treatment method, the CsPbBr3 QDs were prepared by mechanical crystallization. When the QDs glass was ground at different times, due to the synergistic effect of red emission (Eu3+) and green emission (CsPbBr3 QDs), the prepared QDs glass can produce the red-yellow-green polychromatic luminescence phenomenon. Benefit from the dual-emission centers of CsPbBr3 QDs and Eu3+ which do not interfere with each other, the relative sensitivity of the temperature sensing is up to 2.11% K-1, proving that the prepared Eu3+ doped QDs glass has practical application in the field of temperature sensing.

Valorization of not soluble byproducts deriving from green keratin extraction from poultry feathers as filler for biocomposites,"© 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.The valorization of poultry feathers wastes is very important to reduce the environmental pollution deriving from their disposal. In this frame, we present the production process of completely natural, biodegradable, biocompatible, and eco-friendly composites made by not soluble keratin (NSK) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA). NSK has been obtained as a byproduct of a microwave-assisted keratin extraction from poultry feathers and it has been added to PLA pellets without adding any additional compatibilizers or plasticizers, unlike from the other works reported in the literature until now. The mixture has been used to obtain homogeneous NSK-based PLA filaments by means of hot-melt extrusion technology. The filaments have been subsequently 3D printed to explore applications in the additive manufacturing field. All the samples have unaltered thermal stability, but reduced toughness with respect to neat PLA. Other tested parameters (water adsorption, glass transition, and crystallinity) are dependent on NSK content and fabrication technology. Besides, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy highlights the differences in the structure of the NSK-based PLA filaments and 3D printed samples.",Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry,10.1088/1742-6596/2256/1/012014

Highly crystallized glass-ceramics from high content gold tailings via a one-step direct cooling method,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryHighly crystalline glass-ceramics were successfully manufactured via a one-step direct cooling method using Shuangqishan (Fujian, China) gold tailings as raw materials. A series of glass-ceramics were prepared by controlling the gold tailings addition and post-treatment. X-ray diffraction results show that the crystalline phase of glass-ceramics samples with high tailing addition content (65-80 wt%) is akermanite phase (Ca2MgSi2O7). By contrast, the main phase of 60 wt% and 55 wt% tailings addition samples is diopside (CaMgSi2O6) crystalline phase. In addition, although glass-ceramics have typical fracture characteristics of brittle materials, the crack propagation in the fracture process is disturbed by grains, resulting in the deviation of the fracture path in terms of macroscopic and microcosmic observation. Based on the investigation of samples with different tailings additions, glass-ceramics with 60 wt% tailings contents show excellent mechanical properties with a density of 2.89 g cm−3, a Vickers hardness value of 8.17 GPa, and a flexural strength of 116 MPa after 950 °C heat treatment. This study further confirms the possibility of using Shuangqi Mountain gold tailings as the raw materials for highly crystalline glass-ceramics, which shows great potential for application in mass production.",RSC Advances,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128334

The lead removal evolution from hazardous waste cathode ray tube funnel glass under enhancement of red mud melting and synthesizing value-added glass-ceramics via reutilization of silicate resources,"© 2022Waste CRT funnel glass (FG) is a typical hazardous waste produced by the electronics industry that contains toxic lead oxide, red mud (RM) is the first waste produced during alumina production. Both of these are extremely difficult to reuse. Here, we report a method to control FG waste, in which RM was used to enhance the removal of Pb from FG via a vacuum thermal process. The removed residual glass was utilized to create glass-ceramics. The results showed that RM can enhance the lead removal from waste CRT funnel glass by the vacuum thermal process. When 30% RM was added, the removal rate reached 98.54%. A significant mechanism of enhancing delead is investigated by a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that the -Pb-O-Si-O- network structure was broken by the free calcium ions of RM. Afterward, valuable glass-ceramics with tetragonal-KAlSi2O6 and triclinic-CaSiO3 crystals were synthesized using the residual glass. The Pb, Ba, Cr, and Cu leaching concentrations of the glass-ceramics were well below the regulatory limit (5 mg/L) of the CA-EPA, as measured by the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) test. Overall, the results indicated that RM enhanced the removal of lead during the vacuum thermal process.

Numerical modeling and experimental verification of the composite material of PA12/HA with parameterized random distribution in selective laser sintering,"© 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this study is to establish a finite element (FE) model with the random distribution of the Nylon12/hydroxyapatite (PA12/HA) composite material in selective laser sintering (SLS) process for considering the material anisotropy, which aims to obtain the law of temperature and stress changes in PA12/HA sintering. Design/methodology/approach: By using python script in Abaqus, the FE model is established in which the two materials are randomly distributed and are assigned to their intrinsic temperature-dependent physical parameters. Molten pool sizes at various process parameters were evaluated in terms of numerical simulation and scanning electron microscope analysis, identifying a good agreement between them. Evaluation of temperature and stress distribution under the condition of different HA contents was also conducted. Findings: It shows that the uneven distribution and quantity of HA powder play a vital role in stress concentration and temperature increase. Additionally, the influence of HA addition on the mechanical performance of SLS-fabricated parts shows that it is conducive to improve compressive strength when the HA ratio is less than 5% because an excess of HA powder tends to bring about a certain amount of microspores resulting in a decrease in part density. Originality/value: The FE model of the PA12/HA composite material with parameterized random distribution in SLS can be applied in other similar additive manufacturing technologies. It provides a feasible guideline for the numerical analysis of properties of composite materials.",Rapid Prototyping Journal,10.4103/jispcd.JISPCD_50_22
Synthesis and Sintering Impact on the Properties of Willemite Based Glass-Ceramics Using Rice Husk Waste as Silica Source,"© 2022 Authors. Published by association for ETRAN Society.The impact of sintering duration on willemite-based glass-ceramics (WGC) derived from the ZnO-B2 O3-SiO2 host system through a conventional melt-quenching method by incorporating rice husk ash (RHA) as the silica (SiO2 ) source was comprehensively studied by means of physical, structural, and optical properties. The increment of sintering duration elevated the diffusivity rate resulting in a gradual increment of bulk density and linear shrinkage over sintering time. The XRD patterns affirmed the β-Zn2 SiO4 phase formed after sintering at 700o C for 2 h, followed by α-Zn2 SiO4 crystallization at a higher holding time. FESEM observation revealed that Zn2 SiO4 embedded in the glassy solid phase and grew in equiaxed shape crystals as the holding time increased. Absorption spectra revealed the increasing trend in absorption bands with an increase in sintering duration due to the intensification of Zn2 SiO4 crystallization thus escalating the green emission. Thus, this WGC will be applied as optically phosphor materials.",Science of Sintering,10.7502/j.issn.1674-3962.202110002
Fracture Load of Layered Glass-Ceramic Structures,"© 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The mechanical behavior and failure mode of multilayered bonded and non-bonded glass-ceramic structures after long-term water-aging is relevant considering how widely used these ceramics are in many fields. This work is focused on ceramic structures used in dentistry. The objective here was to determine the fracture load of ceramic structures not bonded and bonded to a dentin analog material (G10) using low (L) and high-viscosity (UH) dual-cured resin cements (C). Porcelain (P) disks were tested whether bonded or not bonded to G10, as follows: a) P – control group, b) PHF – acid etched, c) P·CL – HF and coated with CL, d) P·CUH – HF and coated with CUH, e) P·CL·G10 – HF and bonded to G10 using CL, and f) P·CUH·G10 – HF and bonded to G10 using CUH. The groups bonded to G10 were stored in deionized water for 24 h, 1, 3, and 6 months. The fracture load was examined using Weibull statistics. The Weibull modulus (m) for group P was similar to that of PHF and significantly higher than for P·CL and P·CUH. P·CL showed higher m than P·CUH. As for the characteristic fracture loads (F0), P and PHF showed statistically similar values that were significantly higher than those obtained for P·CL and P·CUH. For P·CUH·G10, there was no effect of storage time on both the F0 and m. For P·CL·G10, storage time only caused significant changes in F0. After aging, there was no change in the mechanical behavior of the porcelain structures bonded to G10 using CUH. There was a decrease in F0 over time when CL was used. These results reveal that the viscosity of the resin cement plays an important role in the mechanical behavior of the bonded porcelain structures. Overall, ceramic structures bonded using a high-viscosity dual-cured resin cement seems to present better performance over time.",Strength of Materials,10.1007/s10717-022-00458-5

Development of SiO2-Based Protective Coatings on TiAl Alloy TiAl合金表面SiO2防护涂层研究进展,"© 2022, The Editorial Board of Materials China. All right reserved.Due to low density, high specific strength, and good creep resistance, TiAl alloy has been considered as the high-temperature structure candidates in aerospace and automotive industries. However, the poor high-temperature oxidation resistance limits its applications. The pure SiO2 coating with compact structure, good thermal and chemical stability can effectively improve the high temperature oxidation resistance of TiAl alloy. However, there are some issues when the SiO2 coating with simplified structure is exposed to air at high temperature for long-term, such as the large difference in the thermal expansion coefficients between SiO2 coating and TiAl substrate, and poor stability of the coating and substrate interface. To deal with these issues, SiO2 composite coating emerges, including the introduction of intermediate layer between the SiO2 coating and TiAl substrate, preparation of glass ceramic-based composite coating using the SiO2 coating as the intermediate layer. This paper briefly introduces the oxidation behavior of TiAl alloy and the methods to improve the oxidation resistance of TiAl alloy. The research progress of the silica-based protective coating at home and abroad was reviewed. The preparation methods and principles, high temperature oxidation behavior, structure of oxide scale and protective mechanism of silica-based coatings were discussed. The development trend of silica-based coatings on TiAl alloy in the future was prospected.",Materials China,10.3390/ma15103614

Friction-Wear Characteristics of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Paper-Based Friction Materials under Different Working Conditions,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.To study the friction and wear performance of carbon fiber reinforced friction materials under different working conditions, paper-based friction materials with different fibers were prepared. Experiments on the SAE#2 test bench were conducted to study the infectors including friction torques, surface temperature, coefficient of friction (COF), and surface morphologies. The results were analyzed, which indicated that the carbon fiber reinforced friction material could provide a higher friction torque and a lower temperature rising rate under the applied high pressure and high rotating speed conditions. As the pressure increased from 1 MPa to 2.5 MPa, the friction torque of plant fiber reinforced material increased by 150%, the friction torque of carbon fiber reinforced material increased by 400%, and the maximum temperature of plant fiber reinforced and carbon fiber reinforced material reached the highest value at 1.5 MPa. Thus, carbon fibers not only improved the COF and friction torque performance but also had advantages in avoiding thermal failure. Meanwhile, carbon fiber reinforced friction materials can provide a more stable COF as its variable coefficient (α) only rose from 38.18 to 264.62, from 1 MPa to 2.5 MPa, which was much lower than the natural fiber reinforced friction materials. Simultaneously, due to the good dispersion and excellent mechanical properties of PAN chopped carbon fibers, fewer pores formed on the initial surface, which improved the high wear resistance, especially in the intermedia disc.",Materials,10.1364/OME.458233
Preliminary Study on the Optimization of Femtosecond Laser Treatment on the Surface Morphology of Lithium Disilicate Glass-Ceramics and Highly Translucent Zirconia Ceramics,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.All-ceramic restorations have become increasingly popular in dentistry. Toward ensuring that these restorations adhere to the tooth structure, this study determines the optimal femtosecond laser (FL) treatment parameters for lithium disilicate glass-ceramics and highly translucent zirconia ceramics with respect to surface morphology. For both the ceramics, the following surface conditions were investigated: (1) as-sintered; (2) Al2 O3 sandblasted; (3) FL treatment (dot pattern with line distances of 14, 20, and 40 µm); (4) FL treatment (crossed-line pattern with a line distance of 20 and 40 µm). Surface roughness parameters were estimated using a 3D confocal laser microscope; microstructures were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope. Peak fluence (Fpeak) values of 4 and 8 J/cm2 and irradiation numbers (N) of 20 and 10 shots were selected to create dot patterns in highly translucent zirconia and lithium disilicate glass-ceramics, respectively. Furthermore, Fpeak = 8 J/cm2 and N = 20 shots were chosen to obtain crossed-line patterns in both ceramics. Our results show that lithium disilicate glass-ceramics and highly translucent zirconia exhibit a similar surface morphology under each of the surface treatment conditions. Therefore, FL irradiation of dot or crossed-line patterns (at a distance of 20 and 40 µm) are potential candidates for future investigations.",Materials,10.13801/j.cnki.fhclxb.20211106.002
Synthesise and Characterization of Cordierite and Wollastonite Glass—Ceramics Derived from Industrial Wastes and Natural Raw Materials,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Industrial waste is one of the primary sources that harm the environment, and this topic has occupied many scientists on how to take advantage of these wastes or dispose of them and create a clean environment. By-pass cement dust is considered one of the most dangerous industrial wastes due to its fine granular size and its volatilization in the air, which causes severe environmental damage to human and animal health, and this is the reason for choosing the current research point. In this article, eight samples of glass–ceramics were prepared using by-pass cement dust and natural raw materials known as silica sand, magnesite, and kaolin. Then melted by using an electric furnace which was adjusted at a range of temperatures from 1550 to 1600◦ C for 2 to 3 h; the samples were cast and were subjected to heat treatment at 1000◦ C for 2 h based on the DTA results in order to produce crystalline materials. Various techniques were used to study the synthesized glass–ceramic samples, including differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and thermal expansion coefficient (CTE). X-ray analysis showed that the phases formed through investigated glass–ceramic samples consisted mainly of β-wollastonite, parawollastonite, diopside, anorthite, and cordierite. It was noticed that β-the wollastonite phase was formed first and then turned into parawollastonite, and also, the anorthite mineral was formed at low temperatures before the formation of the diopside mineral. SEM showed that the formed microstructure turned from a coarse grain texture to a fine-grained texture, by increasing the percentage of cordierite. It also showed that the increase in time at the endothermic temperature significantly affected the crystalline texture by giving a fine-grained crystalline texture. The linear thermal expansion measurements technique used for the studied glass–ceramic samples gives thermal expansion coefficients ranging from 6.2161 × 10−6 to 2.6181 × 10−6 C−1 (in the range of 20–700◦ C), and it decreased by increasing cordierite percent.",Materials,10.14062/j.issn.0454-5648.20210554

Preparation and modification of nano-TiO2 and its application in polymer matrix composites research progress 纳米二氧化钛的制备、改性及其在聚合物基复合材料中的应用研究进展,"Copyright ©2022 Acta Materiae Compositae Sinica. All rights reserved.The composite materials prepared based on the titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles as additives have excellent heat resistance, aging resistance, etc. The TiO2 nanoparticles have special photocatalytic activity, such as, it has strong antibacterial and bactericidal ability after absorbing ultraviolet energy. Currently, TiO2 nanoparticles have a wide range of applications in various fields of coatings, cosmetics and medicine. However, affected by the nano-dimensional effect, the TiO2 nanoparticles in the polymer matrix have the disadvantages of being easy to agglomerate and difficult to disperse, which limits its application. Therefore, it is necessary to regulate the surface properties of nano-TiO2 by various surface modification methods to enhance its compatibility with the polymer matrix. This paper first described the preparation, surface modification method and mechanism of TiO2 nanoparticles in detail, subsequently, and the research progress on the TiO2 nanoparticles modified polymer compound composite material is reviewed in the recent years.

Effect of Titanium Dioxide on Crystallization Behavior and Properties of MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 Glass-Ceramics 二氧化钛对镁铝硅微晶玻璃析晶行为与性能的影响,"© 2022, Editorial Department of Journal of the Chinese Ceramic Society. All right reserved.Cordierite glass-ceramics exhibit low dielectric constant, dielectric loss and thermal expansion. Thestoichiometric cordierite MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (MAS) glass is due to the surface crystallization. In this paper, MAS glass-ceramics with various contents of TiO2 asa nucleation agent were prepared by a melting method and subsequent heat treatment. The effect of TiO2 content on the crystallization behavior and properties was investigated. The results show that the glass transition temperature and the first crystallization peak temperature decrease with the increase of TiO2 content, indicating that TiO2 can effectively promote the crystallization. TiO2 enters into the glass network structure, and facilitates the formation of μ-cordierite and magnesium aluminum titanate crystalline phases in the glass, and then form α-cordierite at a higher temperature. The crystallization mechanism of glass with more than 5% (in molar fraction) TiO2 becomes the bulk crystallization. As TiO2 content increases to 10%, the glass-ceramics heat-treated at 800℃ for 10h and 1000℃ for 5h have a high density of 2.95g/cm3, a hardness of 9.67GPa, and a thermal conductivity of 2.13W/(m•K). At 8.2-12.4 GHz, its dielectric constant is 6.3-6.5 and the dielectric loss fluctuates from 10-2 to 10-3. At 1MHz, the dielectric constant is 10.8 and the dielectric loss is 0.0244.",Kuei Suan Jen Hsueh Pao/Journal of the Chinese Ceramic Society,10.15517/IJDS.2021.47853
Effect of Chlorides Content on the Structure and Properties of Porous Glass Ceramics Obtained from Siliceous Rock,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Porous glass-ceramic materials are used in the construction engineering and repair of various objects. The article investigates the method for obtaining porous glass ceramics from siliceous rock with a high calcite content. To obtain samples with an even fine porous structure, a small amount (≤0.386%) of chloride (NaCl, KCl, MgCl2·6H2 O, CaCl2) was added to the charge mixture. At the first stage, mechanochemical activation of raw materials was carried out. Siliceous rock, Na2 CO3 and additives (chlorides) were grinded together in a planetary ball mill. The resulting charge was annealed at a temperature of 850◦ C. The influence of the type and amount of chloride on the properties of the charge mixture and glass ceramics has been defined by thermal analysis (TA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), etc. The chlorides in the charge mixture decreased the calcite’s decarbonization temperature and had an effect on the macro-and microstructure of the material. As a result, samples of glass ceramics with an even finely porous structure in the form of blocks were obtained. The samples consist of quartz, wollastonite, devitrite, anorthoclase and an amorphous phase. On average, 89–90% of the resulting material consists of with small pores. The apparent density of the samples is in the range of 245–267 kg/m3. Bending and compressive strength reaches 1.75 MPa and 3.8 MPa, respectively. The minimum thermal conductivity of the modified samples is 0.065 W/(m·◦C). The limiting operating temperature is 860◦ C, and the minimum thermal shock resistance is 170◦ C. The material has a high chemical stability. They can be used as thermal insulation for some types of industrial and civil facilities.",Materials,10.1007/s10854-022-08201-0
Surface Morphology Changes of Bleached Dental Ceramics,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Tooth whitening is one of the most conservative procedures for increasing the aesthetics of patients, but the effect of bleaching on ceramic restorations has not been extensively studied. In this study, the bleaching effect on three dental restoration materials (polished/glazed lithium disilicate glass ceramic, leucite reinforced glass ceramic and zirconium dioxide ceramic) has been investigated in terms of surface roughness changes of the exposed samples. Philips Zoom NiteWhite 16% carbamide peroxide, Philips Zoom 6% hydrogen peroxide with following LED illumination and Pola Office 6% hydrogen peroxide have been used for ceramic bleaching. The experimental investigation and performed statistical analysis revealed that the highest surface roughness changes of all investigated ceramics were caused by the hydrogen peroxide and the lowest by carbamide peroxide. These findings correlated well with the colour changes observed in the same bleached dental ceramic samples indicating potential of carbamide peroxide as the most prospective bleaching agent.",Applied Sciences (Switzerland),10.1007/s00269-022-01187-5
How a 16% Carbamide Peroxide Home Bleaching Agent Affects the Surface Properties of Chairside CAD/CAM Materials? ¿Cómo afecta un agente blanqueador casero de peróxido de carbamida al 16% a las propiedades de la superficie de los materiales CAD/CAM de consultorio?,"© 2022, Universidad de Costa Rica. All rights reserved.Surface changes of restorative materials after bleaching have clinical importance in terms of the durability and survival of restorations. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of home bleaching on the surface roughness, microhardness, and surface analysis of four different types of chairside computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials. Specimens were prepared from composite resin (Brilliant Crios: BC), resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate: LU), polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (Vita Enamic: VE), and zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic (Vita Suprinity: VS) CAD/CAM materials. Specimens were polished using 800, 1000, 1200, and 2000 grit SiC papers. Each restorative material was randomly divided into two groups; control and bleaching (n=10). The 16% carbamide peroxide bleaching agent (Whiteness Perfect 16%, FGM) was applied to the specimens for 4 h/ day for 14 days. Surface roughness values (Ra) were obtained using a profilometer, and microhardness values (VHN) were obtained using a Vickers microhardness test. Surface analysis of specimens was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Data were analyzed Two-way ANOVA and Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) test (p<0.05). After bleaching, the surface roughness of BC (p<0.001) and VE (p<0.032) significantly increased. Bleaching did not significantly affect the microhardness of CAD/CAM materials. SEM evaluation showed material-dependent surface damages after bleaching procedures. The effect of 16% carbamide peroxide home bleaching agent on surface roughness and microhardness of chairside CAD/CAM materials is material-dependent. Before bleaching, restorative materials should be protected by applying a protective barrier and contact with the bleaching agent should be minimized. Also, after bleaching, the restoration surface should be carefully inspected, and re-polishing might be beneficial.",Odovtos - International Journal of Dental Sciences,10.3390/cryst12050574
Phase evolution and dielectric properties of La2O3–B2O3–ZnO glass-ceramics/Al2O3 composites for LTCC substrates at high frequencies,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Low-temperature sinterable and low-loss composites consisting of La2O3–B2O3–ZnO glass-ceramics and Al2O3 filler have been investigated. The phase composition of LBZ/Al2O3 composites is closely related to the sintering temperature. When the sintering temperature was 850 °C, the main phases included LaBO3 and La(BO2)3 precipitated from LBZ glass-ceramics, ZnAl2O4 and LaAl2.03(B4O10)O0.54 phases generated by interfacial reactions, and Al2O3 filler. The high content of crystalline phases in the composites indicated the low content of residual glassy phases, which was related to the low loss of the composites at high frequencies, especially at microwave frequencies. The initial sintering temperature and the temperature corresponding to the fastest shrinkage speed of LBZ/40A and LBZ/50A composites were related to the content of LBZ glass-ceramics, and all the composites could be densified at low temperatures. Optimum properties were exhibited for the composite of LBZ glass-ceramic with 50 wt% Al2O3 sintered at 900 °C with a permittivity εr = 7.3 and a dielectric loss tan δ = 1.62 × 10−3 (at 12.1 GHz). The low εr and tanδ coupled with a low sintering temperature, suggesting that the LBZ glass-ceramic/Al2O3 composites had potential to meet the requirements of LTCC substrate materials for high frequencies.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,10.3390/ma15093068
"Structure and thermodynamics of calcium rare earth silicate oxyapatites, Ca2RE8(SiO4)6O2 (RE = Pr, Tb, Ho, Tm)","© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Calcium rare earth silicate oxyapatites, (Ca2RE8(SiO4)6O2), are of interest as components of glass–ceramic nuclear waste forms. To assess their long-term behavior in a geologic repository, it is essential to determine their structure and thermodynamic stability at relevant conditions. In this work, we performed detailed structural and thermodynamic investigations on Ca2Pr8(SiO4)6O2, Ca2Tb8(SiO4)6O2, Ca2Ho8(SiO4)6O2, and Ca2Tm8(SiO4)6O2 by high energy synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction combined with Rietveld analysis and high temperature oxide melt drop solution calorimetry. Enthalpies of formation from constituent oxides (∆Hf,ox) were determined to be − 765.1 ± 22.8 kJ/mol for Ca2Pr8(SiO4)6O2; − 638.9 ± 20.5 kJ/mol for Ca2Tb8(SiO4)6O2; − 643.3 ± 10.3 kJ/mol for Ca2Ho8(SiO4)6O2; and − 403.2 ± 5.1 kJ/mol for Ca2Tm8(SiO4)6O2. These thermodynamic parameters were used in assessing the thermochemical stability of these phases in the presence of water vapor from room temperature to 600 K, as encountered in the subsurface environments of a geological repository.",Physics and Chemistry of Minerals,10.1016/j.hydromet.2022.105876
"Crystallization of Glasses Containing K2 O, PbO, BaO, Al2 O3, B2 O3, and TiO2","© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The objective of this work was to obtain glass-ceramics from stable glasses, with a compo-sition of barium, lead, and potassium titanate phases, for use as semiconductors. For this purpose, the glass-ceramic technique was used to control crystal growth and obtain a fine-grained microstruc-ture. Various glasses containing K2 O, PbO, BaO, Al2 O3, B2 O3, and TiO2 were prepared using a melt-quenching method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed a single amorphous phase of all samples. Infrared spectra confirmed the presence of B-O bonds stretching vibrations of (B3 O6 )3− boroxol rings and BO3 triangles, as well as Ti-O stretching vibrations of (TiO6/2 ) and (AlO6/2 ) octahedral units. Thermal analyses confirmed the presence of one or more crystallization peaks in the range of 700 to 744◦ C. On this base, they were heat-treated to promote crystal growth. XRD and SEM detected Ba4 Ti12 O27, Ti7 O13, and BaTiO3 phases, homogeneously distributed throughout the material with fine crystallite size. In addition, crystallized glasses’ (glass-ceramics) properties were determined; the density values were 2.8–3.55 g/cm3; the chemical resistance to acidic and basic media was low; and the band-gap values were in the range of 2.88 to 3.05 eV. These results suggest that crystallized glasses may have application in photocatalysis.",Crystals,10.1002/pc.26609
Role of Eu2+ and Dy3+ Concentration in the Persistent Luminescence of Sr2MgSi2O7 Glass-Ceramics,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In this study, glass-ceramics based on Sr2MgSi2O7 phosphor co-doped with Eu/Dy were obtained from the sintering and crystallisation of glass powders. The glasses were melted in a gas furnace to simulate an industrial process, and the dopant concentration was varied to optimise the luminescence persistence times. The doped parent glasses showed red emission under UV light excitation due to the doping of Eu3+ ions, while the corresponding glass-ceramics showed persistent blue emission corresponding to the presence of Eu2+ in the crystalline environment. The dopant concentration had a strong impact on the sintering/crystallisation kinetics affecting the final glass-ceramic microstructure. The microstructures and morphology of the crystals responsible for the blue emission were observed by scanning electron microscopy–cathodoluminescence. The composition of the crystallised phases and the distribution of rare-earth (RE) ions in the crystals and in the residual glassy phase were determined by X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The emission and persistence of phosphorescence were studied by photoluminescence.",Materials,10.1007/s10967-022-08288-z
Recovery of Li from lithium aluminum silicate (LAS) glass-ceramics after heat treatment at 1000 °C and Ca salt-assisted water leaching in two stages before and after calcination at 600 °C,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this study, the leaching of Li from lithium aluminum silicate (LAS) glass-ceramics was conducted using a Ca salt additive and water, with the content of other impurities at a minimum. LAS glass-ceramics were heat-treated at 1000 °C to increase the reactivity with leachate before the water leaching process. Various types of Ca salts were employed, and their effects on Li leaching were investigated. The reaction temperature, reaction time, and mass ratio of the Ca salt to the LAS glass-ceramics were considered as leaching parameters. Approximately 42.1% of Li was found to be leached by water at 100 °C via an ion exchange reaction between Li+ and Ca2+. X-ray diffraction revealed a peak shift of the leach residue, indicating that Li+ was substituted by Ca2+. When water leaching was conducted again after calcining the leach residue at 600 °C, Li leached from the LAS glass-ceramics exceeded 99.9%. Thus, Li can be recovered from LAS glass-ceramics using only a Ca salt and distilled water, without the requirement of other chemicals.",Hydrometallurgy,10.1016/j.jmrt.2022.02.090
Digital light processing mediated 3D printing of biocomposite bone scaffolds: Physico-chemical interactions and in-vitro biocompatibility,"© 2022 Society of Plastics Engineers.This study reports development of digital light processing (DLP) mediated 3D printed customized bone scaffolds. Bioactive fluorcanasite glass ceramic was incorporated within photocurable resin matrix and the suspensions were 3D printed towards developing composite bone scaffolds. Physico-chemical interaction in the biocomposite bone scaffolds were investigated using infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Further, the mechanical properties of the composite scaffold samples were also evaluated to understand the strengths of the samples in terms of its fracture toughness, flexural strength, and compressive strength. Infrared spectroscopy results demonstrated an active interaction between the acrylate functionalities of the polymer with the bioactive fluorcanasite glass ceramic reinforcement. This was further substantiated with x-ray diffraction results, demonstrating rise in the bioactive crystalline peaks with corresponding increase in the fluorcanasite glass ceramic loading. Later, the samples were also evaluated for in-vitro cellular response in terms of cell viability, proliferation, adhesion, and interaction. The surface hydrophilicity responsible for osteogenic interaction was also studied with contact angle goniometry. With increase in fluorcanasite loading in the formulation, the hydrophilicity was found to increase over the sample surface which in turn was found to enhance cell adhesion and proliferation, as revealed byin-vitro MTT assay and also fluorescence microscopy. To establish the efficacy of DLP technique, two different porous architectural designs were 3D printed and investigated with synchrotron micro-computed tomography. The microtomographs revealed precise microarchitecture and interconnected porosity within the scaffolds.",Polymer Composites,10.1007/s00784-022-04449-2
Systematic investigation on durability of glass–ceramics containing CePO4: orthogonal analysis,"© 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.CeO2 was applied as a structure analog to radionuclides that tents to have similar structure such as Np, Pu, and Ce. Element Ce in CeO2 was immobilized into CePO4 glass-ceramic with nano-hydroxyapatite (nano-HAP) as a modifier, promoting the fabrication of the ceramic phase. Through the orthogonal method, chemical durability was estimated systematically with the product consistency test (PTC) based on multiple factors. According to the range and variance analysis of the results, the influence degree of the factors follows this sequence: pH > content of nano-HAP > temperature.

A novel approach for preparing glass ceramic foams from MSWI fly ash: foaming characteristics and hierarchical pore formation mechanism,"© 2022 The Author(s)Powder sintering and in–situ foaming are the primary treatments for the preparation of glass ceramic foams from solid wastes. However, variables such as crystallization and viscosity, which are difficult to regulate at high temperatures. Herein, a novel technology based on alkali activation–crystallization strengthening was developed for the fabrication of glass ceramic foams with hierarchical pores. Vitrified municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) ashes as the main calcium and aluminum source and secondary aluminum ash (SAA) as a foaming agent were foamed in NaOH solution at room temperature. The effects of solid–liquid ratio and NaOH concentration on the pore structure, individual foam force, phase evolution and physical properties were investigated, including crystallization kinetics and hierarchical pore formation mechanism. The results indicated that the solid–liquid ratio decreased from 60:40 to 40:60, making the pore wall thin and eventually disappear. The pore size in the range of 0–1 mm reaches 99.5% in 3 mol/L NaOH sample, with the lowest mean size of 0.34 mm. The crystallization kinetics parameters of the basic glass at 5–20 K/min showed that grains were primarily precipitated as three–dimensional at 5 K/min, resulting in micropores. The prepared samples exhibit high porosity (79.23–88.35%), adequate compressive strength (0.36–5.55 MPa) and a bulk density of 0.68–0.76 g/cm3. This work develops the function of SAA as a foaming agent at room temperature, as well as a new idea for the preparation of glass ceramic foams from solid waste containing glass phase or needing vitrification.",Journal of Materials Research and Technology,10.1016/j.ijleo.2022.168851
Clinical performance of resin-matrix ceramic partial coverage restorations: a systematic review,"© 2022, The Author(s).Objective: To evaluate clinical performance of the new CAD/CAM resin-matrix ceramics and compare it with ceramic partial coverage restorations. Materials and methods: An electronic search of 3 databases (The National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE/PubMed), Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) was conducted. English clinical studies published between 2005 and September 2020 that evaluated the clinical performance of CAD/CAM resin-matrix ceramics inlays, onlays, or overlays were selected. The primary clinical question was applied according to PICOS strategy (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Study design). The included studies were individually evaluated for risk of bias according to the modified Cochrane Collaboration tool criteria. Results: A total of 7 studies were included according to the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. From the included studies, 6 were randomized clinical trials while one study was longitudinal observational study without control group. According to the results of the included studies, the success rate of CAD/CAM resin-based composite ranged from 85.7 to 100% whereas the success rate reported for ceramic partial coverage restorations ranged from 93.3 to 100%. Fractures and debondings are found to be the most common cause of restorations failure. Conclusion: CAD/CAM resin-based composite can be considered a reliable material for partial coverage restorations with clinical performance similar to glass ceramic restorations. However, this result needs to be confirmed in long-term evaluations. Clinical relevance: CAD/CAM resin-based composites provide a potential alternative to ceramic indirect restorations. However, clinicians must be aware of the lake of knowledge regarding long-term outcome.",Clinical Oral Investigations,10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.109788
Structural and crystallization behavior studies on unfamiliar LiF–B2O3 glasses,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Glasses from the binary high LiF–B2O3 system with variable LiF contents (10–55 mol%) were prepared by normal melting-annealing technique. Optical, FTIR spectral properties were measured for the glasses in addition to thermal expansion parameters were derived to be able to convert glassy samples to their corresponding glass-ceramic derivatives. FTIR, X-ray diffraction and SEM were carried out for the prepared heat-treated glass-ceramics to derive their structural building groups and types of crystalline phases formed by controlled heat treatment regime. Optical spectra of the prepared glasses show only distinct UV absorption peaks which are related to unavoidable contaminated traces of impurities of Fe3+ ions. FTIR spectra reveal distinct extended vibrational bands within the mid-region 400-1600 cm−1 comprising both of triangular and tetrahedral borate groups (BO3, BO3F) beside the possibility of sharing of (LiF4) groups at high LiF content. Thermal expansion measurements indicate the changes of the dilatometric softening temperatures with the LiF content but with some derived variations depending on the constituents housing in the network structure. X-ray diffraction patterns data reveal the appearance of lithium borate crystalline phase at low LiF content and at high content both two crystalline phases of lithium borate Li2B4O7 (Diomignite) and LiB3O5 beside crystalline lithium fluoride (LiF) are identified. This result refers to the distinct action of both lithium ions (Li+) and fluoride ions (F−) as initiator to produce phase separation, ease of nucleation and followed by crystallization, similar to the behavior of Li2O within borate and silicate glasses. SEM images support the X-ray diffraction data revealing different crystalline phases with variable texture at high LiF content.",Materials Chemistry and Physics,10.1016/j.ssi.2022.115888
Theoretical Investigation of the radiation-protection properties of the CBS glass family,"© 2022 Elsevier GmbHA novel scalable approach combining Monte Carlo Simulation (MS) and the Phy-X/PDS (Phy-X) software program have been developed to investigate the radiation shielding properties of the well-known (CBS-1, 2, and 3) family of glass-ceramics (CaO, B2O3, and SiO2). The linear attenuation coefficient (LAC), half-value layer (HVL), mean free path (MFP) and transmission factor (TF) were identified as important parameters controlling the behavior of the CBS shielding family by MS. Phy-X, on the other hand, explored the effective (Zeff) and equivalent (Zeq) atomic numbers, as well as the build-up factors. It was discovered that (CBS-1) and (CBS-3) shielding could be comparable to commercially manufactured glass shielding, and even higher in some cases. Furthermore, CBS-3 demonstrated the greatest shielding ability among the CBS family members, with a maximum LAC value of ~ 38.77 cm-1 at a gamma energy of ~ 0.015 MeV. Our findings pave the way for future research based on the CBS glass family to accelerate the development of shielding materials for high-energy electromagnetic waves.",Optik,10.1177/08853282211065624
Micromechanics-based phase field fracture modelling of CNT composites,© 2022 Elsevier LtdWe present a novel micromechanics-based phase field approach to model crack initiation and propagation in carbon nanotube (CNT) based composites. The constitutive mechanical and fracture properties of the nanocomposites are first estimated by a mean-field homogenisation approach. Inhomogeneous dispersion of CNTs is accounted for by means of equivalent inclusions representing agglomerated CNTs. Detailed parametric analyses are presented to assess the effect of the main micromechanical properties upon the fracture behaviour of CNT-based composites. The second step of the proposed approach incorporates the previously estimated constitutive properties into a phase field fracture model to simulate crack initiation and growth in CNT-based composites. The modelling capabilities of the framework presented is demonstrated through three paradigmatic case studies involving mode I and mixed mode fracture conditions.,Composites Part B: Engineering,10.1016/j.jnucmat.2022.153640

Hybrid nanocomposite as a chest wall graft with improved vascularization by copper oxide nanoparticles,"© The Author(s) 2022.Chest wall repair can be necessary after tumor resection or chest injury. In order to cover or replace chest wall defects, autologous tissue or different synthetic materials are commonly used, among them the semi-rigid gold standard Gore-Tex® and prolene meshes. Synthetic tissues include composite materials with an organic and an inorganic component. On the basis of previously reported hybrid nanocomposite poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid amorphous calcium phosphate nanocomposite (PLGA/aCaP), a CuO component was incorporated to yield (60%/35%/5%). This graft was tested in vitro by seeding with murine adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) for cell attachment and migration. The graft was compared to PLGA/CaCO3 and PLGA/hydroxyapatite, each providing the inorganic phase as nanoparticles. Further characterization of the graft was performed using scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, PLGA/aCaP/CuO was implanted as a chest wall graft in mice. After 4 weeks, total cell density, graft integration, extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and collagen I, the cellular inflammatory response (macrophages, F4/80 and lymphocytes, CD3) as well as vascularization (CD31) were quantitatively assessed. The nanocomposite PLGA/aCaP/CuO showed a good cell attachment and cells migrated well into the pores of the electrospun meshes. Cell densities did not differ between PLGA/aCaP/CuO and PLGA/CaCO3 or PLGA/hydroxyapatite, respectively. When applied as a chest wall graft, adequate stability for suturing into the thoracic wall could be achieved. Four weeks post-implantation, there was an excellent tissue integration without relevant fibrotic changes and a predominating collagen I matrix deposition within the graft. Slightly increased inflammation, reflected by increased infiltration of macrophages could be observed. Vascularization of the graft was significantly enhanced when compared with PLGA/aCaP (no CuO). We conclude that the hybrid nanocomposite PLGA/aCaP/CuO is a viable option to be used as a chest wall graft. Surgical implantation of the material is feasible and provides stability and enough flexibility. Proper tissue integration and an excellent vascularization are characteristics of this biodegradable material.",Journal of Biomaterials Applications,10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2022.111518
A novel Sr2Nd8(SiO4)6O2 glass-ceramics for rapid immobilization of FP and An3+ co-doped uranium tailings by microwave sintering: mechanism and performance,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Oxyapatite (general formula:A2IA8II(BO4)6O2) is a potential material for immobilization of nuclear waste. Here, a novel Sr2Nd8(SiO4)6O2 glass-ceramics (GCs) derived from uranium tailings were synthesized by consecutive microwave sintering technology at 1200 °C for simultaneous immobilization of simulated bivalent fission product (FP) Sr and trivalent actinide (An3+) Nd. Sr and Nd were successfully immobilized into A2I and A8II acceptor sites of oxyapatite respectively, and glass structures. The phase evolution, microstructure, physical property, and radon exhalation of as-prepared sintered forms were systematically investigated by XRD, FT-IR, SEM-EDS, TEM, and RAD7 radon meter. The experimental results demonstrated that the ultimate solid solubility of Sr reached 25 wt.%, while Nd exceeded 30 wt.% at 1200 °C. Importantly, the solidified samples exhibited homogenous and dense microstructure, and the radon exhalation rate improved with the increase of pore. It was indicated that oxyapatite glass-ceramics could be a potential matrix for the simultaneous immobilization of bivalent FP and An3+.",Journal of Nuclear Materials,10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.106867
"3D printed biocompatible graphene oxide, attapulgite, and collagen composite scaffolds for bone regeneration","© The Author(s) 2022.Tissue-engineered bone material is one of the effective methods to repair bone defects, but the application is restricted in clinical because of the lack of excellent scaffolds that can induce bone regeneration as well as the difficulty in making scaffolds with personalized structures. 3D printing is an emerging technology that can fabricate bespoke 3D scaffolds with precise structure. However, it is challenging to develop the scaffold materials with excellent printability, osteogenesis ability, and mechanical strength. In this study, graphene oxide (GO), attapulgite (ATP), type I collagen (Col I) and polyvinyl alcohol were used as raw materials to prepare composite scaffolds via 3D bioprinting. The composite materials showed excellent printability. The microcosmic architecture and properties was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared and thermal gravimetric analyzer, respectively. To verify the biocompatibility of the scaffolds, the viability, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSCs) on the scaffolds were assessed by CCK-8, Live/Dead staining and Real-time PCR in vitro. The composited scaffolds were then implanted into the skull defects on rat for bone regeneration. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson staining and immunohistochemistry staining were carried out in vivo to evaluate the regeneration of bone tissue. The results showed that GO/ATP/COL scaffolds have been demonstrated to possess controlled porosity, water absorption, biodegradability and good apatite-mineralization ability. The scaffold consisting of 0.5% GO/ATP/COL have excellent biocompatibility and was able to promote the growth, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of mouse BMSCs in vitro. Furthermore, the 0.5% GO/ATP/COL scaffolds were also able to promote bone regeneration of in rat skull defects. Our results illustrated that the 3D printed GO/ATP/COL composite scaffolds have good mechanical properties, excellent cytocompatibility for enhanced mouse BMSCs adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. All these advantages made it potential as a promising biomaterial for osteogenic reconstruction.",Journal of Biomaterials Applications,10.1016/j.jlumin.2022.118786
Multi-fidelity progressive damage simulation of notched composite laminates with various ply thicknesses,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdIn this study, a multi-fidelity fracture simulation scheme of composite laminates that accomplishes a seamless transition between medium- and high-fidelity crack models, namely, smeared crack models (SCMs) and discrete crack models (DCMs), is developed. The proposed scheme is based on the adaptive discrete-smeared crack (A-DiSC) method and a theoretical model for saturated crack density. The A-DiSC method first employs a DCM to model the transverse cracks in the laminates. If the crack density of each ply reaches the saturation value calculated using the theoretical model, the DCM is converted to an SCM. At this point, some cracks that are longer than a certain critical length remain explicitly modeled by the DCM, as they can significantly affect the subsequent path to final failure. By combining the two models, this method reduces the computational cost while preserving a sufficient prediction accuracy particularly in the case with numerous noncritical cracks up to failure. A simulation of the open-hole tensile test of composite laminates with various ply thicknesses was performed to verify the prediction accuracy of the developed scheme, and the predicted results were compared with the experimental results.",International Journal of Solids and Structures,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121465
Should the translaminar fracture toughness of laminated composites be represented by the R or the J curve? A comparison of their consistency and predictive capability,"© 2022 The AuthorsThe translaminar fracture toughness of laminated composites can be determined experimentally assuming either linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) or cohesive zone model (CZM) hypotheses. Each theoretical frame is different in terms of complexity and predictive capabilities. To clarify the latter point, we derived the R(Δa) (LEFM) and J(ω) (CZM) curves from a set of published results on over-height compact tension fracture specimens of different sizes. Then, these curves were used to predict the strength of other coupons of the same material (geometrically similar, scaled, open hole and center cracked specimens). Since the idealization of the fracture phenomena in cohesive zone models is more realistic than in LEFM, the fracture property so obtained is more independent from the size of the specimen used to measure it and its predictive capability embraces a wider range of sizes and geometries.",Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121469
Probing into structural and spectroscopic properties of Dy3+ doped and Eu3+/Dy3+ co-doped bismuth phosphate (BiPO4) glass ceramics with different modifier fluorides,"© 2022In the present work, the synthesis of BiPO4 phase resided in transparent bismuth phosphate glass ceramics has been accomplished by regular melt quenching route. Impact of modifier fluorides on structural and spectroscopic properties of Dy3+ doped and Eu3+/Dy3+ co doped different bismuth phosphate glass ceramics via PXRD, FTIR, XPS, SEM, optical absorption, emission, excitation and decay measurements has been thoroughly examined. Various spectroscopic parameters were calculated from the absorption spectra using Judd-Ofelt (J-O) theory and analyzed the parameters. From the emission spectra, emission characteristics were studied via optical band gains (σe × τR), gain bandwidths (σe × Δλeff), Y/B ratios and lifetimes (τ) from decay curves. The effect of Eu3+/Dy3+ co-doping on emission properties has been studied in these glass ceramics where energy transfer was observed. Color coordinates for all the studied systems also inferred. Among various multi component glass ceramics studied in the present work, NaF2 system could be suitable for laser and white light applications.",Journal of Luminescence,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121467
Investigation of the effect of Au2O3 dopant on elastic properties of PbO-B2O3-SeO2: Er2O3 glass ceramics by ultrasonic techniques,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Various elastic coefficients of Au2O3 doped PbO-B2O3-SeO2:Er2O3 (PBSE) glass ceramics were evaluated as functions of Au2O3 content using ultrasonic velocity measurements. The elastic coefficients and micro-hardness showed a decreasing tendency with the concentration of Au2O3. Such decrease is attributed to the increasing concentration of gold metallic particles and [SeO3]2− groups that acted as modifiers and induced imperfections in these samples. Obtained results were observed to be consistent with the conclusions drawn from spectroscopic studies that include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared (IR), photoluminescence (PL) and positron annihilation (PAL) spectroscopy studies. Overall, these studies have revealed that even though, the presence of gold metallic particles is preferable for achieving superior luminescence and electrical properties, presence of such particles caused to decrease the elastic coefficients and micro-hardness of these glass ceramics. However, when the concentration of Au2O3 is increased beyond 0.075 mol%, we have observed a slight increase of elastic coefficients and micro-hardness.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.01.139
The effects of MgF2 in four complex nucleating agents on the performance and crystallization of lithium aluminum silicate glasses,"© 2022Glasses and glass-ceramics in the LAS system containing four complex nucleating agents (TiO2+ZrO2+P2O5+MgF2) were prepared by the traditional melt quenching technology and two-step (nucleation-crystallization) method. The effects of MgF2 contents on the performances and crystallization behavior of parent glass were examined using XRD, SEM, DSC, Fourier transform infrared, Transmittance, TEC, Density, Bending strength, Vickers hardness and the Quality loss of Alkali (Acid) resistance. The result reveals that when the complex nucleating agents (TiO2+ZrO2+P2O5+MgF2) in a ratio of 2: 2: 5: 3, the parent glass has the most prominent performance and optimal crystallization promotion. Fluoride has the better promotion effect on the formation of ZrTiO4 when the MgF2 content is 2 wt%, regardless of whether β-quartz or β-spodumene solid solution used as main crystalline phase. Besides, fluoride may be hinder the precipitation of AlPO4 (in β-quartz solid solution) and has the limit impact on the formation of AlPO4 (in β-spodumene).",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1177/14644207211069763
Effect of strontium on crystallization characteristics and properties of ZnO-Fe2O3-B2O3-P2O5 glass-ceramics for biomedical applications,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The synthesis, crystallization, thermal, and magnetic properties of the glass-ceramics based on ZnO-SrO- B2O3-Fe2O3-P2O5 glasses were studied. The impact of the SrO/ZnO replacements in the crystalline phases formed, the thermo-magnetic properties, and density of the crystalline materials were analyzed. Adding strontium to replace zinc in the glasses led to an increase in the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the crystallization peak (Tc). However, the thermal stability ΔT of the glasses decreased. SEM micrographs have revealed that the addition of SrO instead of ZnO in the glasses led to the formation of a fine-grained microstructure. As major phases, Zn2P2O7, SrZnP2O7, and α-Sr2P2O7 crystallized in glass-ceramic while, two minor phases Fe3(PO4)2 and SrFe2(P2O7)2 were also formed after the controlled heat-treatments process. The magnetic parameters improved with increasing SrO instead of ZnO, which was attributed to the formation of strontium-based crystalline phases. The prepared glass-ceramics have good magnetic properties with saturation magnetization of 0.682–0.852 emu/g, the coercivity force of 26.87–41.77 G, and remanence magnetization of 1.54–4.02 emu/g. The coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) at 500 °C of the glass-ceramic increased to 10.4 × 10−6 °C−1 from 5.2 x 10−6 °C−1 for the base specimen due to SrO/ZnO replacements. The density values of the glass-ceramic specimens were 3.34 –3.46 g/cm3. Depending on the physical, magnetic, and thermal properties of prepared glass-ceramic, these materials can be potentially used as magnetic materials for biomedical applications.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1177/14644207211069616
Role of MgO in lowering glass transition temperature and increasing hardness of lithium silicate glass and glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The effect of variation of MgO (1.5, 4.5 and 7.5 mol%) content on glass structure, crystallization behavior, microstructure and mechanical properties in a Li2O–K2O–Na2O–CaO–MgO–ZrO2–Al2O3–P2O5–SiO2 glass system has been reported here. Increased amount of MgO enhanced the participation of Al2O3 as a glass network former along with [SiO4] tetrahedra, reducing the amount of non-bridging oxygen (NBO) and increasing bridging oxygen (BO) amount in glass. The increased BO in glass resulted in a polymerized glass structure which suppressed the crystallization and subsequently increased the crystallization temperature, bulk density, nano hardness, elastic modulus in the glasses as well as the corresponding glass-ceramics. MgO addition caused phase separation in higher MgO (7.5 mol%) containing glass system which resulted in larger crystals. The nano hardness (∼10 GPa) and elastic modulus (∼127 GPa) values were found to be on a much higher side in 7.5 mol% MgO containing glass-ceramics as compared to lower MgO containing glass-ceramics.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.152565
Comparative study of thermo-mechanical and thermogravimetric characterization of hybrid dental restorative composite materials,"© IMechE 2022.The purpose of the study is to create resin-based micro-nano particulates-filled dental restorative composite materials and investigate the influence of variable nano-hydroxyapatite filler concentration on their thermo-mechanical and thermogravimetric properties. Two series were created by combining silane treated nano-hydroxyapatite filler particles (wt.% of 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8) with foreign ceramic particles (alumina and titanium oxide). Each series consists of five compositions. For each dental composition, the amount of foreign ceramics (20 wt.%) remained constant. The dental composite samples were polymerized for 30 s on each side using a blue LED light. Thermo-mechanical and thermogravimetric analysis was performed at various temperatures range. At preliminary temperatures (30–40°C), the hybrid nano-hydroxyapatite-TiO2 dental composite filled with 8 wt.% nano-hydroxyapatite exhibited storage modulus (about 90 MPa) whereas nano-hydroxyapatite-Al2O3 dental composite filled with 8 wt.% nano-hydroxyapatite exhibited storage modulus (about 260 MPa). Themal stability of nano-hydroxyapatite-Al2O3 and nano-hydroxyapatite-TiO2 dental composite was 99.90% and 99.82% at 90°C, respectively. The glass phase, glass transition phase, and rubbery phase were observed at various temperatures. From the results, it revealed that Al2O3-nano-hydroxyapatite filled dental composite was observed significant than TiO2–nano-hydroxyapatite filled dental composite.","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.01.080
Joining of aluminium matrix composites using friction stir welding: A review,"© IMechE 2022.Aluminium matrix composites are one of the most important classes of materials and have become a major focus of attention in aerospace, aeronautical, defense, and automotive industries. Aluminium matrix composites when compared to conventional alloys offer various promising properties like excellent strength-to-weight ratio, higher stiffness, lower coefficient of thermal expansion, better dimensional stability, and tribological behavior. The properties of aluminium matrix composites are highly influenced by the appropriate selection of metal matrix, processing routes, and reinforcement. Various ceramic particles (oxides, carbides, nitrides, borides, etc.) are used as reinforcements for aluminium matrix composites. Significantly different properties may be obtained using various reinforced particles and matrix material, which makes it difficult for the traditional fusion welding techniques to meet the joining requirements of these composites and is restricted to certain grades of materials. Solid-state welding process offers greater advantages over the conventional fusion welding. As a solid-state joining process, friction stir welding has proven to be a better and promising technique for joining aluminium matrix composites. However, it is still subjected to various challenges to join aluminium matrix composites even with considerable progress has been made in recent years. The current review provides an overview of state-of-the-art of friction stir welding of aluminium matrix composite materials. Specific attention and critical assessment have been given to weldability, the macrostructure and microstructure of aluminium matrix composite joints, mechanical properties of joints, fractography, and the wear of friction stir welding tool during welding of aluminium matrix composite. Furthermore, the various existing challenges of friction stir welding of aluminium matrix composites are summarized and the recommendations for future research are proposed.","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.01.013
A Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped Bi1.95Yb0.04Er0.01V2O8 efficient upconversion glass–ceramic photocatalyst for antibiotic degradation driven by UV–Vis-NIR broad spectrum light,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Photocatalytic films can be used to overcome the obstacles of nanoparticle agglomeration and powder recovery, but are limited by poor stability and low light utilization. Herein, a lanthanide-doped Bi1.95Yb0.04Er0.01V2O8 bulk upconversion glass–ceramic (GC) photocatalyst with a narrow bandgap was developed to overcome these limitations. Bi1.95Yb0.04Er0.01V2O8 was crystallized in the GC, and BiOCl nanosheets were in-situ grown on the surface of the bulk GC photocatalyst. The GC produced strong green (526 and 546 nm), and red (658 nm) emissions under 980 nm excitation. The absorption edge of the GC photocatalyst was extended to 620 nm, such that NIR photons were efficiently harvested, and most of the upconversion emissions during the photocatalysis process were utilized, a high norfloxacin degradation rate of 55.2% was obtained over 90 min of NIR light irradiation. The bulk GC photocatalyst can be easily regenerated by HCl etching again, and it is convenient for recovery. Furthermore, the photocatalyst is also suitable for practical treatment of wastewater with a low concentration of antibiotics, this study provides a novel strategy for the development of efficient photocatalytic films.",Applied Surface Science,10.1007/s43207-021-00185-7
"The role of 4f14 Lu3+ and 3d0 Sc3+ in faraday rotating glass/ceramic: Structural stability, magnetic and magneto optical properties","© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Magneto-optical materials exhibiting low/no temperature-dependent Faraday rotation, high magnetization and good thermal/mechanical stability are required in various magneto-optical sensing and photonic applications. For the first time, we employed the rare earth Lu3+ and Sc3+ ions to strengthen the structure and enhance magnetic& magneto-optical properties of heavy metal oxide diamagnetic glasses. Experimental results revealed that the doping of Lu2O3 and Sc2O3 not only significantly increased the UV-VIS transmittance, improved the thermal stability, Vicker's hardness and tensile strength, but also remarkably increased the magnetic susceptibility and Verdet constant. The reasons were analyzed through the XRD, FT-IR, Raman spectra, oxygen chemical bonds, EPR of Lu2O3 and Sc2O3 crystal fields and affinity to oxygen. Promising Faraday rotating glass with Verdet constant of 76.32 rad/Tm at 633 nm, thermal stability KH = 0.817, very low thermal expansion coefficient (14.04 × 10−6 K−1) and high diamagnetic susceptibility of 9.25 × 10−6 emu/g has obtained which has potential merits for photonics and MO devices applications.",Ceramics International,10.1111/jace.18307
Resistance-curve envelopes for dental lithium disilicate glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdRecent investigations on the mechanics of dental lithium disilicates have gathered mounting evidences of a probable R-curve behavior. Here we use an indirect approach to obtain the contours of the R-curve using the relationship between strength and initial crack size obtained from quasi-static fracture toughness tests. The tangent condition formed by the multiple K I,appl (ai,j) curves give a smoothened polygonal envelope for the R-curves. The R-curves obtained this way were extended toward an initial value at the onset of stable crack extension, obtained hereusing a microcantilever specimen featuring a sharp notch produced by focused-ion-beam milling. The presence of an R-curve effect was confirmed for the three evaluated lithium disilicates, being more pronounced for the injection-molded material having an oriented elongated Li2Si2O5 microstructural architecture, with crystal fraction playing an important role for low-aspect ratio randomly-oriented microstructures.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.12.077
Processing and properties of nano-hBN-added glass/ceramic composites for low-temperature co-fired ceramic applications,"© 2022, The Korean Ceramic Society.LTCC applications require densification at temperatures lower than 950 °C to allow co-firing with metal electrodes, lower dielectric constant to increase signal transmission speed, a thermal expansion coefficient matched to Si for reliability and higher thermal conductivity to dissipate heat. For this purpose, (SiO2–Al2O3–CaO)-based glass (50–60 wt%)/ceramic (Al2O3 or mullite) composites with nano-hBN (0–10 wt%) addition were investigated. Al2O3 was replaced by mullite to decrease dielectric constant and to match thermal expansion coefficient to Si, and hBN was incorporated to increase thermal conductivity and to decrease dielectric constant. Densification at temperatures ≤ 900 °C was easily achieved for all compositions due to viscous sintering of the glass matrix. hBN did not react chemically with crystalline and amorphous phases, which effectively decreased dielectric constant and increased thermal conductivity. Hence, both mullite and nano-hBN strongly improved dielectric and thermal properties required for the LTCC applications. Dense mullite/glass (55 wt%) base composite with 10 wt% hBN addition was successfully engineered and had comparable dielectric and thermal properties (i.e., 2.3 gcm−3 after sintering at 900 °C, dielectric constant (loss) = 5.13 (0.003) at 5 MHz, thermal conductivity = 1.91 Wm−1 K−1 at 25 °C, and thermal expansion coefficient for the base composite = 4.75 ppm°C−1) with respect to the commercial LTCC products.

Microstructure transformation of a crystallized glass from the system BaO-SrO-ZnO-SiO2,"© 2022 The Authors. Journal of the American Ceramic Society published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Ceramic SocietyGlass-ceramics from the studied system are able to precipitate a crystalline phase with an anomalous and low coefficient of thermal expansion. Besides the crystalline phase called LEAZit (Low Expansion Alkaline Earth Zinc Silicate), other phases appear within those glass-ceramics. In order to understand the thermal expansion behavior of the whole material, the phase content has to be known as a function of the composition and the chosen heat treatment. In this paper, a glass with the molar composition 5 BaO · 12 SrO · 35 ZnO · 46.2 SiO2 · 1.5 Sb2O3 · 0.3 Ag is studied using X-ray tomography. With this method, the phase content can be studied in detail together with the microstructure. An ex-situ workflow was used to study one and the same sample after different heat treatments, which makes it possible to characterize the structures (crystalline phase, residual matrix, and porosity) inside the sample in a nondestructive way. The size of the different phases was characterized with a strut thickness analysis of the three-dimensional datasets.

Cyclic contact fatigue behavior of baria-silicate glass-ceramics as a function of crystal aspect ratio,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdCeramic materials are potentially useful for dental applications because of their esthetic potential and biocompatibility. However, evidence of contact fatigue damage in ceramics raises considerable concern regarding its effect on the survival probability predicted for dental prostheses. To simulate intraoral conditions, Hertzian indentation loading with steel indenters was applied in this study to characterize the fatigue failure mechanisms of ceramic materials. Baria silicate glasses and glass-ceramics with different aspect ratios of crystals were selected because the glass and crystal phases have similar density, elastic modulus, and thermal expansion coefficients. Therefore, this system is a model ceramic for studying the effect of crystal geometry on contact cyclic fatigue failure. The subsequent flexural strength results show that the failure of materials with a low fracture toughness such as baria-silicate glass (0.7 MPa m1/2) and glass-ceramic with an aspect ratio of 3.6/1 (1.3 MPa m1/2) initiated from cone cracks developed during cyclic loading for 103 to 105 cycles. The mean strengths of baria-silicate glass and glass-ceramics with an aspect ratio of 3.6/1 decreased significantly as a result of the presence of a cone crack. Failures of baria-silicate glass-ceramics with an aspect ratio of 8.1/1 (Kc = 2.1 MPa m1/2) were initiated from surface flaws caused by either grinding or cyclic loading. The gradual decrease of fracture stress was observed in specimens with an aspect ratio of 8.1/1 after loading in air for 103 to 105 cycles. A reduction of approximately 50 % in fracture stress levels was found for specimens with an aspect ratio of 8.1/1 after loading for 105 cycles in deionized water. Thus, even though this glass-ceramic with an 8.1/1 crystal aspect ratio material is tougher than that with a 3.6/1 crystal aspect ratio, the fatigue damage induced by a large number of cycles is comparable. The mechanisms for cyclic fatigue crack propagation in baria-silicate glass-ceramics are similar to those observed under quasi-static loading conditions. An intergranular fracture path was observed in glass-ceramics with an aspect ratio of 3.6/1. For an aspect ratio of 8.1/1, a transgranular fracture mode was dominant.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.01.010

The present investigation verifies the formation of solid solutions of Na2CaSiO4 and Na2Ca2Si2O7 which have previously assumed to be stoichiometric compounds. The impact of these solid solutions on the features of the phase diagram were investigated using the equilibration-quenching-EDS/EPMA technique.

Controlled surface crystallization of lithium-zinc-alumosilicate glass-ceramics using thermal poling,"© 2021 The Authors. Journal of the American Ceramic Society published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Ceramic SocietyTwo glasses from the lithium-zinc-alumosilicate (LZAS) glass–ceramic system were thermally poled at 0.5 and 0.9 Tg and subsequently crystallized in heat-treatment. Underneath the anode-faced surface of the as-poled glasses, a lithium depletion layer was found with layer thicknesses up to 15 μm. Between the depletion layer and the bulk, an accumulation of sodium was measured. Structural alterations underneath the anode-faced and cathode-faced surfaces of the crystallized glasses were examined using grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. A mainly amorphous layer was observed on all anode-faced surfaces, each containing only small amounts of high-quartz solid solution (high-quartz s.s.). The low crystalline content was attributed to a reduced lithium content when compared to the untreated reference. Additionally, in one sample a keatite solid solution (keatite s.s.) formed in the anode-faced surface with its phase content increasing with the poling temperature. The transformation of high-quartz s.s. to keatite s.s. is facilitated by a silica-rich glass composition beneath the anode-faced surface. Underneath the cathode-faced surface high crystalline contents were obtained, which even exceed the crystalline phase contents found in the untreated reference samples. In combination with an observable larger lattice parameter of the high-quartz s.s. phase, it could be assumed that Li+ cations enrich at the cathode-faced surface. The enrichment of Li+ cations on the cathode-faced and their depletion on the anode-faced surface lead to different particle sizes. Small grains were observed underneath the amorphous layer in the anode-faced surface, while larger grains with an overall broader particle size distribution were found on the cathode-faced surface.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1002/jemt.24031
"Phase composition, microstructure, and mechanical properties of polymer-derived SiOC glass-ceramics reinforced by WC particles","© 2021In this work, a tungsten carbide (WC)-containing silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) glass-ceramic was prepared from WC-filled polysiloxane via pyrolysis and subsequent spark plasma sintering (SPS). The sintering behavior of SiOC was investigated by monitoring the densification temperature and shrinkage displacement. The phase composition and microstructure of ceramics were characterized by using FTIR, XRD, SEM, Raman spectrum, and optical microscope. It was shown that upon increasing the sintering temperature from 1400 °C to 1600 °C, the densification of ceramics was further improved, and the disorder of free carbon in SiOC was linearly decreased with sintering temperature. In addition, it was found that the incorporation of WC particles was effective to reinforce the mechanical properties of ceramics, and relevant strengthening mechanisms were discussed here. Finally, a correlation between phase composition, microstructure, and macroscopic performances of SiOC glass-ceramics was successfully derived.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1111/ijac.13968
Surface Treatment Effect on Shear Bond Strength between Lithium Disilicate Glass-Ceramic and Resin Cement,"© 2022 Thieme. All rights reserved. Georg Thieme Verlag, Rüdigerstraße 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany.Objective The study aimed to evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (LDGC) and resin cement (RC) using different surface treatments. Materials and Methods LDGC blocks (Vintage LD Press) were prepared, etched with 4.5% hydrofluoric acid, and randomly divided into seven groups (n = 10), depending on the surface treatments. The groups were divided as follows: 1) no surface treatment (control), 2) Silane Primer (KS), 3) Signum Ceramic Bond I (SGI), 4) Signum Ceramic Bond I/Signum Ceramic Bond II (SGI/SGII), 5) experimental silane (EXP), 6) experimental silane/Signum Ceramic Bond II (EXP/SGII), and 7) experimental silane/Adper Scotchbond Multi-purpose Adhesive (EXP/ADP). The specimens were cemented to resin composite blocks with resin cement and stored in water at 37 °C for 24 hours. The specimens underwent 5,000 thermal cycles and were subjected to the SBS test. Mode of failure was evaluated under the stereo microscope. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed with Welch ANOVA and Games-Howell post hoc tests (α = 0.05). Results The highest mean SBS showed in group EXP/ADP (45.49 ± 3.37 MPa); however, this was not significantly different from group EXP/SGII (41.38 ± 2.17 MPa) (p ≥ 0.05). The lowest SBS was shown in the control group (18.36 ± 0.69 MPa). This was not significantly different from group KS (20.17 ± 1.10 MPa) (p ≥ 0.05). Conclusions The different surface treatments significantly affected the SBS value between LDGC and RC. The application of pure silane coupling agent with or without the application of an adhesive improved the SBS value and bond quality.",European Journal of Dentistry,10.1111/ijac.13945
Shear bond strengths of two newly marketed self-adhesive resin cements to different substrates: A light and scanning electron microscopy evaluation,"© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the shear bond strengths (SBSs) of two newly marketed self-adhesive resin cements (RCs) to enamel, dentin, and lithium disilicate (LiSi) glass ceramic block. Forty-eight enamel and 48 dentin substrates were obtained from sound human molars. Additionally, 6 × 7 × 5 -mm- sized 24 specimens were produced from LiSi glass ceramic blocks. The tooth specimens were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 12) according to the surface treatments: (1) G-CEM ONE (GCO), (2) G-CEM ONE Adhesive Enhancing Primer (GCO-AEP) + GCO, (3) RelyX Universal (RXU), and (4) Scotchbond Universal Plus (SUP) + RXU. LiSi specimens were randomly divided into two groups (n = 12): (1) G-MultiPrimer (GMP) + GCO and (2) SUP + RXU. Following the RC applications, all specimens were kept in 100% humidity at 37°C for 24 hr and then submitted for SBS testing in a universal testing machine (1 mm/min). Data were analyzed by Welch's, one-way analysis of variance and two independent samples t tests. The nature of failures was examined under a light microscope, and scanning electron microscopy analyses were also performed for interfaces. GCO and RXU showed similar SBS to enamel (p >.05), and the use of adhesives resulted in improved SBS (p <.05). No difference was detected between GCO-AEP + GCO and SUP + RXU. The GCO-AEP + GCO exhibited the highest SBS to dentin (p <.05), followed by GCO ≥ SUP + RXU > RXU (p <.05). There was no significant difference between SBSs of two RCs to LiSi blocks (p >.05). No cohesive failure was determined for the tested groups by light microscope. The use of adhesives prior to the application of self-adhesive RCs improved their bonding to tooth tissues. GCO demonstrated superior SBS to dentin, whereas both self-adhesive RCs generated similar SBS to enamel and LiSi glass ceramic surfaces.",Microscopy Research and Technique,10.1016/j.prosdent.2020.09.048
Flexural strength of a conventionally processed and additively manufactured debased 94% alumina,"© 2021 The American Ceramic Society.Mechanical strength of a 94 wt% debased alumina was measured using ASTM-C1161 specimens fabricated via conventional and lithography-based ceramic manufacturing (LCM) methods. The effects of build orientation and a 1500°C wet hydrogen fire added to the LCM firing sequence on strength were evaluated. A Weibull fit to the conventional flexural specimen data yielded 20 and 356 MPa for the modulus and characteristic strength, respectively. Weibull fits of the data from the LCM specimens yielded moduli between 7.5 and 11.3 and characteristics strengths between 333 and 339 MPa. A Weibull fit to data from LCM specimens subjected to the wet hydrogen fire yielded 14.2 and 376 MPa for the modulus and characteristic strength, respectively. The 95% confidence intervals for all Weibull parameters are reported. Average Archimedes bulk densities of LCM and conventional specimens were 3.732 and 3.730 g/cm3, respectively. Process dependent differences in surface morphology were observed in scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of specimen surfaces. SEM images of LCM specimen cross-sections showed alumina grain texture dependent on build direction, but no evidence of porosity concentrated in planes between printed layers. Fracture surfaces of LCM and conventionally processed specimens revealed hackle lines and mirror regions indicative of fracture initiation at the sample surface rather than the interior.",International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology,10.1016/j.bsecv.2020.09.006
Influence of heat treatment temperature on the properties of the lithium disilicate-fluorcanasite glass-ceramics,"© 2021 The American Ceramic Society.This study aims to investigate the influence of heat treatment temperatures on the mechanical properties and chemical solubility (CS) of lithium disilicate-fluorcanasite glass-ceramics and to develop new dental materials. The glasses and glass-ceramics were prepared using CaF2-SiO2-CaO-K2O-Na2O-Li2O-Al2O3-P2O5-based glass system using a conventional melt quenching method followed by a two-stage crystallization process. This two-stage method involves two heating temperature steps: first at a constant temperature (TS1) of 600°C and second step at varying temperatures (TS2) of 650, 700, 750, and 800°C. The crystallization behavior, phase formation, microstructure, translucency characteristic, density, hardness, fracture strength, and CS were investigated. It was found that the lithium disilicate crystal acted as the main crystalline phase, and the crystalline phase of fluorcanasite occurred at the heat treatment temperatures of 750 and 800°C. In addition, it was found that density, hardness, fracture strength, and CS increased while the translucency values decreased with increasing heat treatment temperatures. Furthermore, the CS increased dramatically when the fluorcanasite phases occurred in the glass-ceramic samples. The maximum density values, Vickers hardness, fracture toughness, and flexural strength are 2.56 g/cm3, 6.73 GPa, 3.38 MPa.m1/2, and 259 MPa, respectively. These results may offer a possibility to design a new material for dental applications based on lithium disilicate-fluorcanasite glass-ceramics.",International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology,10.1016/S1872-5805(22)60589-4
Clinical performance of CAD-CAM crowns provided by predoctoral students at the University of Toronto,"© 2020 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: The clinical success of monolithic lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (LDGC) crowns manufactured with computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) technology provided by predoctoral students has not been fully investigated. Purpose: The purpose of this retrospective clinical study was to evaluate the performance of laboratory-fabricated monolithic posterior LDGC CAD-CAM crowns provided by predoctoral students at the University of Toronto. Specific patient- and provider-related factors were also investigated. Material and methods: A sample of posterior LDGC CAD-CAM crowns (IPS e.max) provided by predoctoral students was evaluated. Crown preparations were made according to specific criteria, and crowns were milled in an in-house laboratory by using the CEREC Bluecam system. The crowns were cemented with Rely-X Unicem (3M ESPE) and Calibra Universal (Dentsply Sirona) resin cements. Clinical assessments of the crowns and supporting periodontal structures were performed following the modified California Dental Association (CDA) criteria. Intraoral photographs and periapical and bitewing radiographs were obtained for further assessment by 2 evaluators. Descriptive statistics, McNemar, t test, log rank (Mantel-Cox) tests, Pearson chi-squared tests, simple logistic regression, odds ratios, and Kaplan Meier survival analyses were performed (α=.05). Results: A total of 189 patients receiving 210 crowns (108 premolar and 102 molar) were examined with a follow-up period of up to 6 years. Altogether, 28 complications were observed (12 technical, 11 biological, and 5 esthetic). No significant association was found between patient age, sex, periodontal condition, tooth type, tooth vitality, cement type, and crown longevity. However, significantly lower survival and success rates were found for mandibular crowns than for maxillary crowns (P=.029). The provider's experience had no significant effect on the clinical performance of LDGC CAD-CAM crowns. The 6-year cumulative survival rate was 93.0%, and the success rate was 86.4%. Conclusions: The ease of use of the CAD-CAM system and clinical performance of LDGC suggest that this technology should be used in the dental school setting by predoctoral students.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.11817/j.ysxb.1004.0609.2020-37777
Strontium-Substituted Bioactive Glass-Ceramic Films for Tissue Engineering Películas vitrocerámicas bioactivas sustituidas con estroncio para la ingeniería de tejidos,"© 2020 SECV.The current study presents a comparison within the framework of 45S5 Bioglass® composition, between two types of coatings, achieved by physical or chemical means. The oxide composition was established within SiO2-P2O5-CaO-MgO-SrO-Na2O system, while the preparation techniques were pulsed laser deposition and spin coating. The target necessary for laser ablation experiments was achieved via sol-gel route, displaying a quite well-densified microstructure, as well as modified combeite and akermanite as crystalline phases. The resulting layers turned out to be continuous, homogeneous, partially crystalline and nanostructured in texture. The physical approach led to thicker films, which completely veiled the surface irregularities of substrate; moreover, they provided higher apatite-forming ability and better performance in terms of biocompatibility with human fibroblast BJ cells.",Boletin de la Sociedad Espanola de Ceramica y Vidrio,10.1088/1742-6596/2252/1/012010

Stress analysis of composites with interfacial bridged cracks and damaged zones,© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Stress analysis of composite structures with bridged cracks and damaged zones is performed with the direct boundary integral equations method in axisymmetric formulation. It is assumed that: a) the crack faces interact in some zones behind of the cracks edges (bridged zones); b) these zones width can be comparable to the whole crack size; c) adjacent parts of the structure can be connected by mechanical ligaments (including interfaces ahead of cracks fronts) and the relative displacements of these parts can occur under the loading (these zones consider as damaged zones). The boundary element software to solve axisymmetric problems of elasticity with interfacial bridged cracks and damaged zones was developed. The results for different properties of composite materials and bonds are presented.

Constructing dendrite-flower-shaped Fe3O4 crystals in glass-ceramic materials as novel broadband high-efficient electromagnetic wave absorbers,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The Snoek limit hinders strong and wideband electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption, and to meet this challenge, it is essential to obtain an economical and scalable microstructural solution. In this work, we used a SiO2-B2O3-RO-Fe2O3 multicomponent glass system to design microstructures using dendritic Fe3O4 crystal precipitates in the amorphous glass matrix. The flower-like Fe3O4 structures that formed in situ at the grain interface exhibited a significant strengthening effect on EMW absorption performance. The minimum reflection loss (RL) value reached − 61.0 dB at 7.2 GHz when the sample thickness was 3.3 mm, and the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) was 6.0 GHz (8.6–14.6 GHz), with a sample thickness of 2.4 mm. This approach not only provided a novel strategy for constructing synergistic multiple transmission-absorption mechanisms, but also provided an option for developing inexpensive high-performance EMW-absorbing materials.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.7498/aps.71.20211953
Studies of porous granular composite based on glass-clay ceramics,"© 2022 Author(s).In the present work glass-ceramic material which can be used in the hydraulic fracturing technology has been investigated. The following composite material consist of milled glass and clay as a plasticizer. The samples were in the form of granules with the diameter of 0.4-0.8 mm. Sintering of granulated samples were conducted at 1050°C with varying of the holding time from 8 up to 14 min. Density and mechanical characteristics such as compression strength and crush resistance depending on the initial composition and firing time have been examined. The resulting material is characterized by high compressional strength, with a low apparent density, which is provided by the internal closed porosity created by adding coke and sawdust as the gasifiers to the initial composition. Granules with 20% of clay fired at 1050°C for 10-12 min have maximum compressive strength and crush resistance.

Research on dielectric and microwave absorbing properties of TiO2/TiB2/Thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) composite materials,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.TiO2/TiB2 materials are prepared by the carbothermal method and high-temperature calcination. Further, the phase composition, microstructure, dielectric and electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption characteristics are investigated. The results display that the product is composed of TiO2, TiB2 and impurity phases. The complex permittivity increases at elevated TiO2/TiB2 loading and slowly decreases with rising frequency in 2-18 GHz. When the TiO2/TiB2 content is 45 wt%, the minimum reflection loss (RLmin ) reaches -43.12 dB at 11.68 GHz with a thickness of 1.9 mm. The effective absorption band (EAB, RL<-10 dB) can reach 3.68 GHz at 2.3 mm as the TiO2/TiB2 content is 30 wt%. The enhanced EM wave absorption owes to the strong polarization loss and high conductivity loss. It goes without saying that TiO2/TiB2 materials can acquire important breakthroughs in the development of novel EM wave absorbers with outstanding absorption loss, wider EAB and smaller thicknesses.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,10.1016/j.msea.2022.142904
Mechanisms of rare earth ion distribution in fluorosilicate glass containing KMnF3 nanocrystal 稀土离子在KMnF3纳米晶复合玻璃中的微观分布机理,"Copyright © 2022 Acta Physica Sinica. All rights reserved.Luminescent materials with an efficient single-(pure) color up-conversion luminescence (UCL) are expected to be applied to three-dimensional (3D) display, lighting, biological imaging, promoting plant growth and improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency of solar cells. In this work, perovskite-type KMnF3 fluoride nanocrystals (NCs) are grown in situ in a fluorosilicate glass co-doped with rare earth (RE) ions Yb3+/Er3+ by a controlled thermal treatment. Compared with precursor glass (PG), the nano-glass composites (also referred to as glass ceramics, or GC in short) thus obtained exhibit a significantly enhanced (by 6 times) red UCL emission. Although a weak green UCL emission can be also observed in the GC, the intensity ratio of the red UCL emission to green UCL emission is as high as 30, implying a good color purity. It is suggested that the dramatic enhancement of UCL emissions in the GCs is due to the doping of RE ions into the KMnF3 NCs with a much lower phonon energy (330 cm-1) than that of the silica glass matrix about 1100 cm-1. However, the doping mechanisms of RE ions into KMnF3 nano-glass composites are not yet conclusive, mainly because of the charge and ionic radius mismatch between RE ion dopants and cations of KMnF3. This work combines the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis technology and the first principles calculation, to unravel the doping mechanism of RE ions in KMnF3 nano-glass composites. First, the HR-TEM study provides straightforward evidence that RE ions are preferentially accumulated in KMnF3 NCs embedded in the glass matrix. Then, through the first-principles calculation considering the charge balance, it is found that the formation energy of RE ions substituting for K+ is lower than for Mn2+ lattice sites in KMnF3, which is most likely related to the fact that the ionic radius of the eight-fold coordinated K+ is larger than that of the six-fold coordinated Mn2+ and thus is more conductive to accommodating the large size RE ions. The electronic densities of states at the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band of KMnF3 increase after doping the RE ions. It is inferred from the profile of partial density of state that RE ions have a strong bonding tendency with F- in the crystal. Benefiting from the efficient energy transfer between RE ions and Mn2+ in KMnF3, the green UCL emission is dramatically quenched, and consequently, the GC is endowed with a highly pure red UCL emission. The present study is expected to deepen the understanding of RE ions doping mechanisms in NCs and facilitate the design of highly efficient UCL materials based on nano-glass composites.",Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2022.125941
Landward zones of mangroves are sinks for both land and water borne anthropogenic debris,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The hotspots for mangrove diversity and plastic emissions from rivers overlap in Asia, however very few studies have investigated anthropogenic marine debris (AMD) pollution in these threatened coastal ecosystems. Despite Hong Kong's position at the mouth of the Pearl River, a major source of mismanaged waste in Asia, the mangroves in Hong Kong have never been extensively surveyed for AMD. Here we assessed the patterns of AMD abundance within 18 mangrove forests across Hong Kong surveying both their landward and seaward zones. We recorded and categorised, according to their material and potential uses, both the amount of debris items and area they covered, to better quantify its potential impact on the mangroves. Across Hong Kong mangroves, the average abundance of debris was 1.45 ± 0.38 (SE) items m−2, with an average coverage of 6.05 ± 1.59%. Plastic formed a high proportion of AMD accounting for 70.31% by number of items and 49.71% by area covered, followed by glass/ceramics and wood/bamboo. Disposable food packaging, fishing gear and industrial and construction related waste were the major sources of AMD we documented. On average, we recorded about six times more debris items m−2 at the landward sites than at the seaward one, but these abundances varied between the East and the West coastlines of Hong Kong. Our data confirms the hypothesis that landward areas of mangrove forests act as traps and retain marine borne debris, but they also suggest that direct dumping of waste from the land could represent a serious impact for these forests placed in between the land and the sea. More research is needed to ascertain the impact of land disposed debris on mangrove degradation, and this study strongly advocates for a cultural shift about the perception of these forests by the public.",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.asr.2022.01.041
Understanding microstructure-mechanical properties relationship in ZrO2–SiO2 nanocrystalline glass-ceramics: The effect of ZrO2 content,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The content of crystalline phase plays a significant role in manipulating the microstructure and mechanical properties of glass-ceramics. This study aims at exploring the optimum content of crystalline phase in ZrO2–SiO2 nanocrystalline glass-ceramics (NCGCs) in terms of obtaining the highest mechanical properties. To this end, the mechanical properties of ZrO2–SiO2 NCGCs with 70 mol%, 75 mol%, 80 mol% ZrO2 were tested and compared with those of the previously prepared NCGCs with ZrO2 content ranging from 35 mol% to 65 mol%. Results showed that 65 mol% was the optimum content of ZrO2 in terms of obtaining the highest flexural strength. The flexural strength of NCGCs with ZrO2 content over 65 mol% was lower than that of the NCGCs with 65 mol% ZrO2. This was because the NCGC with 65 mol% ZrO2 had a homogenous microstructure, with ZrO2 nanocrystallites homogeneously distributed in an amorphous SiO2 matrix. Whereas, when ZrO2 content was increased to 75 mol%, ZrO2 nanocrystallites were not homogeneously distributed in the SiO2 matrix anymore. The formation of SiO2 “holes/canyon” due to ZrO2 grain coalescence resulted in the decrease of flexural strength. The fracture mechanism and wear properties of the NCGCs were also investigated.",Materials Science and Engineering A,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121446

Influence of ZrO2 content on the chemical durability and structure of P2O5-Fe2O3-Al2O3-Na2O-ZrO2 glass ceramics,"© 2022Staring with the composition of 62.5P2O5–16.5Fe2O3–8Al2O3–13Na2O (PFAN), a series of samples have been prepared by doping ZrO2 (from 1 to 12 mol%) through the melting-quenching method. Samples with ZrO2 content from 2 to 12 mol% are glass ceramics, in which zirconium pyrophosphate (ZrP2O7) is the only crystalline phase. The weight fraction of ZrP2O7 increases linearly with the increase of ZrO2. Raman spectra indicate that the Q1 and Q2 units are the dominating structures in glass phase. The standard product consistency test (PCT) show that the chemical durability has been significantly improved with additional ZrO2, which is due to that the formation of ZrP2O7, the increase of Q1 units, and the dissolution of Zr4+ ions in the glass phase. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Mössbauer spectroscopy show that the valance state of iron ions does not change much with ZrO2 content, that the Fe2+/(Fe2++Fe3+) ratio stay around 0.4 to 0.5.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121443
"Glass formation and devitrification behavior of alkali (Li, Na) aluminosilicate melts containing TiO2","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The impact of TiO2 additions on the quenchability of melts derived from the stoichiometry of spodumene (LiAlSi2O6), eucryptite (LiAlSiO4) and nepheline (NaAlSiO4) was investigated by containerless melting. The results reveal a compositional dependence (Al2O3/SiO2 and M2O/Al2O3 ratios, M = Na or Li) of the role of TiO2 during devitrification. Amorphous samples incorporating up to 10 mol% TiO2 could be produced, above which devitrification invariably took place. Interaction of TiO2 with other glass components (such as Al2O3 and Na2O in nepheline glass) perceivably reduced glass stability, while eucryptite and spodumene glasses appeared only affected to the extent to which nanosized TiO2 polymorphs (TiO2(B), anatase and rutile) served as heterogeneous nucleation sites for quartz solid solutions, in which we inferred a substantial incorporation of Ti4+. A reduction in SiO2 content and a preference for peraluminous compositions stand out as viable compositional strategies to foster the glass-forming ability of TiO2-rich aluminosilicate melts.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121463

X Ray Diffraction (XRD) showed formation of TiZrO4 nano crystalline phase at 948 K and major phase β-spodumene (β-LiAlSi2O6) along with some minor phases at temperatures >1073 K. In the intermediate temperature range, γ-spodumene /LixAlxSi3-xO6 (0<x<1)/Virgilite was identified as a major phase which was shown to get converted into stable β-spodumene phase at elevated temperature. Micrographs of heat treated samples revealed nanocrystals of size (<25 nm) of Titanium Zirconate phase at 948 K and shell type microstructure of β-spodumene phase at temperature >1073 K. Decrease in thermal expansion coefficient (α) from 5.5×10−6/K to 2.98×10−6/K (303–573 K) was observed for sample crystallized at around 1073 K. Non isothermal DTA data showed two exothermic peaks, indicating crystallization of two different phases in temperature range of 993 to 1223 K. Activation energy for crystallization (Ea) of first peak was found to be 168±20 kJmol−1 and 187±20 kJmol−1 using Kissinger and Marotta methods, respectively. Model free kinetics was used to find more accurate kinetic parameters such as Ea and predict isothermal reaction progress.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.wear.2022.204257
High-strength glass-ceramic from ZABS system modified with transition metal oxide,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The designed glass-ceramic from the ZABS (ZnO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2) glass-forming system were used for the experiment. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of copper oxide on the structural and mechanical properties of a glass-ceramic, with willemite as the main crystalline phase. Generally, transition metal (TM) oxides significantly affect the crystallisation characteristics, subsequently influencing the thermal behaviour of the glass-ceramics. Both samples were tested to determine the type of structural changes that occur after the introduction of the modifier – copper oxide. The type of deformations occurring during scratch-test, were also checked in terms of plastic flow, structural densification and mechanical properties (Young's modulus and hardness).",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.131741
Preparation and characterization of glass-ceramics with granite tailings and titanium-bearing blast furnace slags,"© 2022The resource utilization of granite tailings and titanium-bearing blast furnace slags is an emphasis of current research and is widely considered. In this work, by adopting these two slags as raw materials, diopside-based glass-ceramics were synthesized by melting-cooling-monolithic crystallization. The influence of the content of granite tailings, namely, the ratio of (SiO2+Al2O3/CaO+TiO2) on the structure and properties of glass-ceramics was characterized with differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, volume density and microhardness. The results suggest that the introduction of granite tailings makes the melting quality of glass deteriorate and the crystallization tendency decrease, the number of microcrystalline in glass-ceramics decreases and the glass phase increases. Moreover, the increase of Si/O ratio is advantageous to the precipitation of wollastonite but not diopside, and the volume density and microhardness of glass-ceramics decrease with the increase of granite tailings. When the content of granite tailings is 40 wt%, the crystal structure of glass-ceramics is moderate, the volume density and microhardness are 3.0207 g/cm3 and 8.6 GPa, respectively, which are excellent for architectural decoration.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.12.341
Material removal by slurry erosion in the robot polishing of optics by polishing slurry nozzles,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Robot polishing is increasingly being used in the production of high-end glass work pieces such as astronomy mirrors, lithography mirrors, laser gyroscopes or high-precision coordinate measuring machines. The quality of optical components such as lenses or mirrors can be described by shape errors and surface roughness. Whilst the trend towards sub nanometre level surfaces finishes and features progresses, matching both form and finish coherently in complex parts remains a major challenge. With increasing optic sizes, the stability of the polishing process becomes more and more important. Polishing agent nozzles supply the polishing process with sufficient polishing agent and it is assumed that this slurry erosion has an influence on the material removal. To investigate this, a static test set-up was built. The primary aim of this paper is to point out and raise awareness of the problem of slurry erosion in glass polishing and the influence of slurry erosion by conventional polishing nozzles is shown. From an angle of 30°, the nozzle turns into a fluid jet tool and removes material independently.",Wear,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.12.333
Fast potassium ion conducting glass-ceramics of Na5YSi4O12-type Na4-xKxY0.6P0.2Si2.8O9,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Novel K+ ion conducting glass-ceramics of Na4−xKxY0.6P0.2Si2.8O9 (x ≤ 0.60) with the Na5YSi4O12-type crystalline structure were produced via a glass-making technique. The temperature and time for nucleation and crystallization were determined to be 873 K and 6 h and 1173 K and 5 h, respectively. The thus-prepared glass-ceramics exhibited excellent conductivities of 1 × 10−2 to 5 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 573 K when x ≤ 0.60; however, the activation energies for conduction increased from 22 kJ mol−1 at x = 0 to 44 kJ mol−1 at 0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.15. Measurements of the ion transference numbers indicated that K+ conduction in the glass-ceramics of partially K+-substituted Na4−xKxY0.6P0.2Si2.8O9 occurred predominantly where K+ ions had substituted mobile Na+ ions rather than the Na+ ions rigidly bonded to SiO4 tetrahedra.",Materials Letters,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.163512

Compared with the precursor glass, the GS ChGCs embedded with GeS2 nanocrystals have the same infrared transparency, but smaller optical bandgap energy and higher mechanical strength. Z-scan measurements show that third-order optical nonlinearity in the GS ChGCs was remarkably enhanced, and this material would be suitable for applications in optical limiting.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.163413
Atomistic insight into the structure and diffusion properties of pollucite glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed with an aim to better understand the structure and ion diffusion properties of pollucite glass-ceramics with alkali metal cations dopants. The minor-radius alkali metal cations influence the resistance of volume deformation but have little effect on that of shear deformation. Compared to pollucite, the bond length and bond angle distributions of glass exhibit a broadening characteristic, and the alkali metal cation type would not affect the local environment of Si/Al. It is found that the self-diffusion coefficient of Cs cations in glass phase is lower than the ones of minor-radius alkali metal cations and is reduced as Na/Li is introduced. In comparison, the self-diffusion coefficient of Cs in pollucite is near zero, and the migration energy barrier of Cs cation obtained from metadynamics simulation reaches up to 124.0 kJ/mol, indicating that pollucite is a kind of excellent immobilization candidate material for radioactive Cs.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103451
The role of fluorine in high quantum yield oxyfluoride glasses and glass-ceramics,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Oxyfluoride glass-ceramics is considered a great candidate for optical refrigeration. Their ability to form low-phonon fluoride crystals embedded in an oxide glass matrix presents great interest for the development of fluorescent efficient materials with good mechanical and thermal resistance. A better understanding of the material microstructure and its relations on properties is mandatory to achieve the required optical refrigeration values. In the present work, we discuss the effect of fluoride compound evaporations and their impacts on thermal, optical, crystallization, and luminescent properties. Using different melting temperatures, glass samples from the theoretical molar composition 37.6 SiO2 – 22.4 Al2O3 – 19 YF3 – 20 LiF – 1 YbF3 are fabricated by the melt-quenching method. The relation between composition and glass properties is assessed by measurement of glass transition, crystallization temperature, density, refractive index, and optical transmission. A detailed study of the crystallization behavior of the samples is conducted using scanning and transmission electron microscopies, and both classical and temperature in-situ x-ray diffractions. Finally, luminescent properties are measured, including quantum yield, and both steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopies.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1039/d2ta02094g
Intense and broadband mid-infrared emission by nano-crystallization of rare‐earth doped oxyfluoride glass-ceramic,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Transparent oxyfluoride glass ceramics (GCs) comprised of a uniform oxide glass phase and a well-distributed fluoride crystal phase are regarded as suitable optical gain materials because of the combination of facile fabricability of glass and low phonon energy of nanocrystals. Here, oxyfluoride GCs containing NaYF4: Er3+/Ho3+/Dy3+ nanocrystals were controllably prepared. Due to the preferential incorporation of rare-earth ions into NaYF4 nanocrystals with low phonon energy and the efficient energy transfer between active ions, enhanced and broadband mid-infrared (MIR) emission at 2.5–3.3 µm was obtained from the GCs, which was nearly unobserved in precursor glass (PG) because of the high phonon energy of glass matrix. Compared with Er3+ singly-doped sample, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is more than 3 times broader in Er3+/Ho3+/Dy3+ triply-doped sample. Furthermore, by the match of the refractive index of glass with NaYF4 nanocrystal, transparent GCs with average crystal size of 80 nm and high transmittance over 80% were achieved simultaneously. The desirable optical properties endow the GCs with potential applications in MIR broadband tunable lasers.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.compscitech.2022.109348
Incorporation of sludge from effluent treatment plant of an industrial laundry into heavy clay ceramics,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe textile sector, in particular the laundries, is one of the industrial sectors that generates large quantity of wastes that require an appropriate treatment before their disposal in the environment. In addition to productive costs increasing, the deposition of wastes in appropriate sanitary landfills is the least noble alternative as regards the inverted pyramid for solid waste management hierarchy. In this context, the traditional ceramics industries which produce primarily bricks and roofing tiles represents one of the best alternatives to use a huge variety of industrial solid wastes. The main objective of this work is to assess the technical, environmental and the economic feasibility to use the dried textile sludge as raw material for the traditional ceramic industry. The results demonstrated that the presence of organic matter in the waste resulted in a high loss on ignition, which increased the ceramic porosity, generating an increase in water absorption and firing linear shrinkage and a mechanical strength reduction. However, although this waste has impaired the properties, the values of all of them were within the limits required by Brazilian standards for bricks. In addition, heat release occurred during the volatilization of the organic compounds in the dried textile sludge, which may contribute to energy saving during the ceramic firing stage. In relation to the environmental analysis, it can be concluded that this waste can be used as by-product for traditional ceramics industries without causing significant damage to the environment.",Journal of Building Engineering,10.11896/cldb.21020054
Achieving ultrahigh discharge energy and power density in niobate-based glass ceramics via A-site substitution modulation during crystallization,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryHigh discharge power density and energy density are the key to the application of dielectric capacitors in pulsed power systems. Glass ceramics, exhibiting the high dielectric breakdown strength and fast charge/discharge rate of glasses, are supposed to be a promising material for inorganic dielectric capacitors. However, the discharge energy and power density of glass ceramics are still too low to be used under practical charge-discharge test conditions. In this work, by introducing Ag2O into niobate-based glass ceramics (consisting of crystalline phase KBaSrNb5O15) to modulate A-site substitution in the precipitated nano-crystalline phase, high discharge energy density (∼3.62 J cm−3 @ 800 kV cm−1) and ultrafast discharge rate (t0.9 ∼ 6.8 ns) resulting in ultrahigh power density (∼1054.8 MW cm−3) can be simultaneously achieved in glass ceramics. Meanwhile, these niobate-based glass ceramics also show good temperature stability of energy storage properties from room temperature to 120 °C. The significant improvement of energy storage properties for niobate-based glass ceramics is mainly attributed to the enhanced dielectric constant and high applied charge electric field strength (up to 800 kV cm−1) via Ag+ ions with a smaller radius substituting K+ ions at the A-site. This work proposes a facile strategy to improve the dielectric permittivity while maintaining high applied charge electric field strength in glass ceramics. The as-prepared glass ceramics show great potential for high power dielectric capacitor application.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.11896/cldb.20110101
Validation and development of trace-based approach for composite laminates,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdA new mathematical proof for the expression of thickness-normalized stiffness is proposed in this study, and the similar thickness-normalization method is further used to the third order transverse shear deformation theory and stiffness analysis of hybrid laminate. By which, the thickness-normalized transverse shear stiffness matrix and the trace of hybrid laminate are derived. Furthermore, through the statistical analysis of the mechanical properties for 228 kinds of unidirectional composite materials, the accuracy of the concept of master ply is verified. Meanwhile, a special focal point (38°, 0.385) of trace-normalized off-axis stiffness coefficient (Q′11*) is found for nearly all unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced composite materials. Finally, by analyzing the carpet plots of in-plane stiffness coefficients, flexural stiffness coefficients and transverse shear stiffness coefficients for five typical composite materials, the feasibility of trace-based scaling approach is confirmed.",Composites Science and Technology,10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2022.111006
Effect of Nd2O3 on Structure and Properties of Powellite-Zirconolite Borosilicate Glass Ceramics Nd2O3对钼酸钙-钙钛锆石硼硅酸盐玻璃陶瓷结构和性能的影响,"© 2022, Materials Review Magazine. All right reserved.In this paper, a borosilicate glass-ceramic waste form with powellite and zirconolite as the main crystalline phases was developed, for the high content of lanthanide (Ln) and transition metal (Mo) in high-level liquid waste arising from spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, and the phase composition, structure and leaching properties of glass-ceramic forms with content of 0mol%-5mol%Nd2O3 were investigated. The results show that two major target phases, powellite and zirconolite, are observed for the glass-ceramics with 0mol%-3mol% Nd2O3, which are homogenously distributed in the glass matrix. With Nd2O3 addition, the BO4 group transformed to BO3, bulk density and oxygen packing density gra-dually increased, and the structure became denser. PCT result shows that after 28 d, the leaching rate of glass-ceramic incorporated Nd2O3 reduced by about two orders of magnitude lower than that of those without Nd2O3 glass ceramic, and for the sample with 3 mol% Nd2O3, of which LRSi, LRCa, LRMo and LRNd are approximately 1.90×10-3 g•m-2•d-1, 6.38×10-4 g•m-2•d-1, 8.27×10-5 g•m-2•d-1and 1.42×10-6 g•m-2•d-1.",Cailiao Daobao/Materials Reports,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.163309
Research Progress of Intelligent Self-healing Materials 智能自修复材料研究进展,"© 2022, Materials Review Magazine. All right reserved.Typical failures of mechanical parts are all derived from the early micro-damages on the surface of materials. Parts in service under the conditions of wear, corrosion, fatigue and other conditions often cause overall failure due to local damages to the materials surface, and eventually lead to equipment failure or even catastrophic consequences. The phase, microstructure, mechanical property and service behavior of traditio-nal engineering materials are determined after the chemical component and preparation technology are determined. And it is hard to satisfy the new requirements of extreme working conditions, high reliability and long service life. The biological system can heal its own damage by self-repairing, and help organisms recover and extend life. In recent years, intelligent self-healing materials and technologies, inspired by the process of self-repairing and self-healing of biological damage, on the basis of the cross fusion of intelligent materials, advanced surface technology and bionic science and information technology, integrating damage perception and stimulation, state intelligent diagnosis and online repairing and healing, have been developed.And a new solution is provided to solve the problems of early micro-damage repair of materials and improve the operation efficiency, reliability and service life of engineering systems. After decades of research and development, self-healing materials have covered many fields, such as concretes, polymers, ceramics, metals and so on. The damage modes targeted by the self-healing process also include wear, corrosion and fatigue. The research in this field involves the design of self-healing materials, the construction of self-healing system, the evaluation of self-healing performance and the mechanism of self-healing. It has become a hot research direction of interdisciplinary integration. In this review, the classification and basic principle of typical self-healing materials systems are introduced. The research progress of self-hea-ling materials for three typical damage failure modes of wear, fatigue and corrosion are summarized, and the current problems and future development trends in this field are analyzed.",Cailiao Daobao/Materials Reports,10.12693/APhysPolA.141.345

Therefore, it is not easy to prepare multifunctional nano-matrix membranes with excellent performance. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have superiority in absorption of impurities and contaminants in aqueous solution. Therefore, Polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration membrane modified by CNTs and PAA-g-MWCNT/TiO2 (AMT) organic-inorganic hybrid particles is synthesized. And a new nano-matrix composite membrane PAA-g-MWCNT/TiO2@PES (AMTP) is prepared after the combination of the two particles, which endows the new composite membrane with three major effects of fouling resistance, photocatalysis and antibacterial properties.

Development of electrically conductive ZrO2-CaO-Fe2O3-V2O5 glass and glass-ceramics as a new cathode active materials for Na-ion batteries with high performance,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Glass-ceramics xZrO2•10Fe2O3•(90-x)V2O5 with ‘x’ between 0 and 30 mol% and yZrO2･(20-y)CaO･10Fe2O3･70 V2O5 glass with ‘y’ between 0 and 20 mol%, respectively abbreviated as xZFV and yZCFV, before and after heat treatment at 500 °C for 100 min, were evaluated as potential cathode-active materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Relationships between physical properties and local structure of xZFV and yZCFV glass-ceramics were investigated by 57Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy, V K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), DC four-probe method and differential thermal analysis (DTA). SIBs containing heat-treated xZFV glass-ceramics showed the highest discharge capacity of 153 mA h g−1 under a current density of 50 mA•g−1, which exhibited a high electrical conductivity of 1.8 × 10−2 Scm−1. Precipitation of V0.05Zr0.95O2 and Fe2V4O13 nanoparticles were confirmed from the XRD pattern of the heat-treated 20ZFV glass, consistent with the lower energy of the pre-edge peak at 5467 eV in the V K-edge XANES spectrum. This result is associated with the reduction of vanadium ions from VV to VIV. It is concluded that the precipitation of stable vanadium bronze phases with high electrical conductivity and structural stability effectively enable the high SIB capacity of these materials.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.msec.2022.112655

All rights reserved.The concentration series of the lithium-vanadate-borate glass samples of xLi2O-2V2O5-(98 − x)B2O3 (x = 8-58) composition was synthesized by the melt quenching procedure and studied. Some of the samples were doped with luminescent LaVO4:Eu,Ca vanadate nanoparticles. Emission spectra of the un-doped samples consist of the wide bands of own luminescence peaked at 540, 650 and 720 nm, whereas spectra of the doped samples are linear and observed in the 570-720 nm spectral range. These spectra correspond to Eu3+ ions intrinsic emission. Lithium oxide component adding to the vanadate-borate glass composition increased the optical quality of the samples and affected their luminescence spectra.

Unexpected Resistance of Polyelectrolyte Brushes Formed via Surface-Initiated Polymerization on Glass and Sitall,"© 2022 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) and poly(2-carboxyethyl acrylate) brushes, including enriched with Li+ cations, were grafted to the glass and glass-ceramic via radical polymerization initiated by immobilized low molecular weight 4,4'-azobis (4-cyanopentanoic acid) and multi-site oligoperoxide metal complex initiators. The atomic force microscopy method was used to characterize and determine the thickness of polymer layers. Surface tension and contact angle of modified substrates were studied using contact angle measurements. It was revealed that resistance properties of grafted brushes studied in the frequency range 10−3-106 Hz by impedance spectroscopy depend on the initiator, substrate, and polymer natures and can be explained by the formation of polymer brushes of different packing densities on the substrates. It was assumed that 4-6 orders falling values of resistance observed for “grafting from” polyelectrolyte brushes initiated by 4,4'-azobis (4-cyanopentanoic acid) on glass substrate was caused by proton conductivity.",Acta Physica Polonica A,10.14062/j.issn.0454-5648.20211002
Superparamagnetic and highly bioactive SPIONS/bioactive glass nanocomposite and its potential application in magnetic hyperthermia,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Magnetic bioactive glass-ceramics are biomaterials applied for magnetic hyperthermia in bone cancer treatment, thereby treating the bone tumor besides regenerating the damaged bone. However, combining high bioactivity and high saturation magnetization remains a challenge since the thermal treatment step employed to grow magnetic phases is also related to loss of bioactivity. Here, we propose a new nanocomposite made of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) dispersed in a sol-gel-derived bioactive glass matrix, which does not need any thermal treatment for crystallization of magnetic phases. The scanning and transmission electron microscopies, X-ray diffraction, and dynamic light scattering results confirm that the SPIONs are actually embedded in a nanosized glass matrix, thus forming a nanocomposite. Magnetic and calorimetric characterizations evidence their proper behavior for hyperthermia applications, besides evidencing inter-magnetic nanoparticle interactions within the nanocomposite. Bioactivity and in vitro characterizations show that such nanocomposites exhibit apatite-forming properties similar to the highly bioactive parent glass, besides being osteoinductive. This methodology is a new alternative to produce magnetic bioactive materials to which the magnetic properties only rely on the quality of the SPIONs used in the synthesis. Thereby, these nanocomposites can be recognized as a new class of bioactive materials for applications in bone cancer treatment by hyperthermia.",Biomaterials Advances,10.14062/j.issn.0454-5648.20211116

All right reserved.The glass material of low-temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC) has an important influence on the performance of the substrate. In this paper, the properties of the co-fired glass materials used in LTCC were introduced, the influences of component and preparation process on the material properties were summarized, and the existing mature systems were analyzed. The superior dielectric properties of CaO-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic system are due to the presence of the massive crystal phases. However, the components and preparation process fluctuations have a great influence on the properties due to its sensitive sintering and crystallization behavior. The structure of PbO-B2O3-SiO2 glass/ceramic composite system is compact and the glass phase is not easy to crystallize. The material has a table properties and superior mechanical properties. However, its application in a high frequency field is restricted because of the massive leaded glass phases.

Comparative Assessment of the Functional Parameters for Metal-Ceramic and All-Ceramic Teeth Restorations in Prosthetic Dentistry—A Literature Review,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The metal-ceramic fixed partial prosthesis is the golden standard for posterior tooth restorations. Following the demands of patients and clinicians for metal-free restorations, all-ceramic materials were developed as they offer an adequate alternative with better optical qualities and good mechanical properties. This study aims to carry out a bibliographic review to assess the survival rate and the biological and technical complications of all-ceramic and metal-ceramic fixed partial dentures. An electronic search for articles in the English language literature was performed using PubMed (MEDLINE). This literature review focused on research studies between 2010 and 2020 that performed clinical studies on tooth-supported fixed partial dentures with a mean follow-up of at least 3 years. All the studies, which analyzed the survival and complications of tooth-supported fixed partial dentures, were included. Thus, 14 studies reporting on 756 all-ceramic and 160 metal-ceramic fixed partial dentures met the inclusion criteria. A comparative analysis was carried out based on all the data existing in the studies included in this review. The metal-ceramic fixed partial dentures showed survival rates of 95% to 100% at 3-, 5-, and 10-year follow-up periods. Zirconia fixed partial dentures were reported to have survival rates of 81% to 100% at 3-, 5-, 9-, 10-year follow-up evaluations. The reinforced glass-ceramic fixed partial dentures showed survival rates of 70% to 93.35% at 5 years, while the alumina FPDs showed a survival rate of 68% at 3 years follow-up. The incidence of caries and loss of vitality were reported as higher for all-ceramic prostheses as compared to the metal-ceramic ones. A significant framework fracture was reported for glass-infiltrated alumina fixed partial dentures in comparison to metal-ceramic fixed partial dentures. All-ceramic and metal-ceramic restorations showed similar survival rates after 3 years, although all-ceramic restorations have problems with technical complications such as chipping, which can lead to framework fractures over time.",Biology,10.14062/j.issn.0454-5648.20211030

These materials are used in optical data storage, random laser, X-ray image, lighting and display, solar cells, photocatalysis, etc.. Recent advances on the preparation and the corresponding performance/application were introduced, i.e., the use of fs laser to form CsPbX3 in selected zone to serve as optical data storage, thereby showing the regular pattern of these materials' composition-structure-performance relationship. Nevertheless, these are some challenges of investigating for these materials, i.e., the in-situ formation of CsPbX3 in glass matrix is entirely unclear.

All right reserved.Dual-phases glass ceramics (GCs) containing LiYF4: Ln3+(Ln=Eu, Tb, Dy) and ZnAl2O4: Cr3+ nanocrystals (NCs) were fabricated by a conventional melt-quenching method. The structural and spectrographic characterizations indicate that Ln3+ can be doped into LiYF4 lattice and Cr3+ can be introduced into ZnAl2O4 lattice, respectively. In this regard, the luminescent centers are physically separated through a spatial isolation strategy, getting rid of adverse energy transfer processes.The dual-modal luminescence of Ln3+ and Cr3+ can be thus attained simultaneously. Also, optical thermometry based on the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of Ln3+/Cr3+ is performed. Under irradiation upon 377 nm, the FIR value for Tb3+: 5D4→7F5 and Cr3+: 2E→4A2 transitions varies acutely, with a maximal relative sensitivity of 0.80%•K-1 at 570 K. The FIR-based optical thermometry for Dy3+: 4F9/2→6H13/2 and Cr3+: 2E→4A2 transitions is carried out, with a maximal relative sensitivity of 0.86%•K-1 at 573 K. As a consequence, the dual-phases GCs can be an ideal medium for the spatial isolation of luminescent centers, suppressing an adverse energy transfer process and realizing an efficient dual-mode luminescence. This is beneficial to the application of FIR-based optical thermometry for GC materials.",Kuei Suan Jen Hsueh Pao/Journal of the Chinese Ceramic Society,10.3390/polym14071445

Preparation and mechanical properties of nano-iron-graphene oxide/chitosan composites 纳米铁-氧化石墨烯/壳聚糖复合材料的制备及其力学性能,"Copyright ©2022 Acta Materiae Compositae Sinica. All rights reserved.Nano-iron and graphene oxide (GO)-modified chitosan (CS) composites have the superior adsorption performance to heavy metals in water, which is environmentally friendly. The field has good application prospects. However, the effects of different contents of nano-iron and/or GO modified CS on the mechanical properties of composite materials are very limited. Therefore, CS was used as the polymer matrix, GO and FeCl3·6H2O were used as nanofillers, different ratios of nano-iron-graphene oxide/chitosan (Fe-GO/CS) composites were prepared by the solution mixing evaporation method material. By using the FTIR, XRD, SEM, TGA and mechanical property testing, the structure, thermal stability and mechanical properties of the composite material were studied. The research results show that nano-iron and GO are well dispersed in the CS matrix, and there is a strong molecular interaction force, and no agglomeration and amorphous structure of iron complex is formed. An appropriate mixture of nano-iron and GO can enhance the hydrogen bonding between CS and fillers, thereby improving the thermal stability and mechanical properties of Fe-GO/CS composites. The results of mechanical properties test show that the tensile strength and elastic modulus of Fe-GO/CS composites increase from 27.5 MPa to 65.4 MPa and 925.8 MPa to 2141.4 MPa, respectively, which are 58% and 57% higher than those of pure CS. But excessive nano-iron reduces the tensile strength, elastic modulus, breaking elongation and thermal stability. TG analysis shows that 1wt% nano-iron modification is beneficial to improve the stability of Fe-GO/CS composite film.",Fuhe Cailiao Xuebao/Acta Materiae Compositae Sinica,10.1109/TCPMT.2022.3163557
Current Development and Future Perspective on Natural Jute Fibers and Their Biocomposites,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The increasing trend of the use of synthetic products may result in an increased level of pollution affecting both the environment and living organisms. Therefore, from the sustainabil-ity point of view, natural, renewable and biodegradable materials are urgently needed to replace environmentally harmful synthetic materials. Jute, one of the natural fibers, plays a vital role in developing composite materials that showed potential in a variety of applications such as household, automotive and medical appliances. This paper first reviews the characterization and performance of jute fibers. Subsequently, the main focus is shifted towards research advancements in enhancing physical, mechanical, thermal and tribological properties of the polymeric materials (i.e., synthetic or biobased and thermoplastic or thermoset plastic) reinforced with jute fibers in a variety of forms such as particle, short fiber or woven fabric. It is understood that the physio-mechanical properties of jute-polymer composites largely vary based on the fiber processing and treatment, fiber shape and/or size, fabrication processes, fiber volume fraction, layering sequence within the matrix, interaction of the fiber with the matrix and the matrix materials used. Furthermore, the emerging research on jute fiber, such as nanomaterials from jute, bioplastic packaging, heavy metal absorption, electronics, energy device or medical applications and development of jute fiber composites with 3D printing, is explored. Finally, the key challenges for jute and its derivative products in gaining commercial successes have been highlighted and potential future directions are discussed.",Polymers,10.3390/nano12071194
Electrochemical Performance of Highly Conductive Nanocrystallized Glassy Alluaudite-Type Cathode Materials for NIBs,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Alluaudite-type materials are systematically attracting more attention as prospective cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. It has been demonstrated that optimized thermal nanocrystallization of glassy analogs of various cathode materials may lead to a significant increase in their electrical conductivity. In this paper, three alluaudite-like glasses (Na2 Fe3 (PO4 )3 — FFF, Na2 VFe2 (PO4 )3 —VFF, and Na2 VFeMn(PO4 )3 —VFM) were synthesized and subjected to an optimized thermal nanocrystallization. This procedure resulted in nanostructured samples with increased electrical conductivity at room temperature: 5 × 10−7 S/cm (FFF), 7 × 10−5 S/cm (VFM), and 6 × 10−4 S/cm (VFF). The nanocrystalline microstructure was also evidenced by ultra-high-frequency impedance spectroscopy (up to 10 GHz) and proposed electrical equivalent circuits. Prototype electrochemical cells were assembled and characterized with voltage cutoffs of 1.5 and 4.5 V. The electrochemical performance was, however, modest. The gravimetric capacity varied between the studied materials, but did not exceed 35 mAh/g. Capacity retention after ca. 100 cycles was satisfactory. Further optimization of the residual-glass-to-nanocrystallite volume ratio would be desirable.",Energies,10.1007/s00339-022-05424-0
Thermoplastic Laminate and Cordierite/Indialite Glass-Ceramic Hybrid Package for 15-GHz Operated Antennas,"© 2011-2012 IEEE.This work describes a novel antenna package, a combination of a four-element array and a lens antenna performing the gain of 13.5 dBi, the bandwidth of 1 GHz and the total efficiency of 72% at 15 GHz. The 2 × 2 elements array antenna was designed and fabricated using square patches with a substrate through vias and a capacitive feeding on the novel dielectric substrate combination: thermoplastic laminate and cordierite/indialite glass-ceramic. The ceramic substrate was selected regarding its impressive dielectric properties such as the relative permittivity of 6.3 and a quality factor Qf 55 400 GHz. The array antenna performed with a reflection coefficient -20 dB over the bandwidth. The cascaded array with an extended hemispherical lens antenna enhanced the gain into the certain direction with narrow beamwidth properties.

Adaptive stochastic morphology simulation and mesh generation of high-quality 3D particulate composite microstructures with complex surface texture,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Particulate composite materials have a broad range of potential applications in engineering and other disciplines. Accurate modeling of their microstructures and fast generation of the finite element meshes play a vital role in investigating many micromechanical phenomena and improving understanding of the underlying failure mechanisms. Due to the exceedingly intricate multiscale internal structures that they possess, the modeling and meshing of their microstructures still remain difficult in general. In this work, we present a computational framework and methodology for the representation, simulation, and mesh generation of 3D stochastic microstructures of particulate composites. Towards this goal, we propose a multi-level multiscale scheme that allows for capturing the multiscale structures of particulate composite materials at both the coarse and fine scales. A briging scale approach based on heat kernel smoothing is also presented to seamlessly link the coarse and fine scales. In addition to the microstructural modeling of particulate composite materials, we also develop an adaptive curvature-based surface and volume mesh generation algorithm for particulate composite microstructures with complex surface texture. Following the implementation of the morphology and mesh generation algorithm, a series of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the capability and potential of the proposed method.",Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering,10.1016/j.optmat.2022.112134
A Highly Stable Li-Organic All-Solid-State Battery Based on Sulfide Electrolytes,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Sulfide solid electrolytes with high conductivity that is close to that of liquid electrolyte have been considered to be one of the most promising electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Unfortunately, the narrow electrochemical windows of sulfide electrolyte and contact loss at the interface upon cycles much limits the application of sulfide-based ASSLBs. In this work, an organic quinone cathode, 5,7,12,14-pentacenetetrone (PT), is used to fabricate an ASSLB with a sulfide electrolyte of glass ceramic 70Li2S-30P2S5 (LPS). Based on the various in situ/ex situ analyses, it is successfully demonstrated that the decomposition of LPS is negligible and the corresponding effects on interfacial impedance are reversible with optimized carbon additives. In addition, the inherent low Young's modulus of the PT electrode efficiently prevents the contact loss at the interface. As a result, the PT-based ASSLBs deliver a high specific capacity (312 mAh g−1) and an excellent capacity retention (90.6%) over 500 cycles which is superior to previous reports. Moreover, a carbon-free ASSLB is constructed by employing Mo6S8 as conductive additives in a PT-based cathode, which shows an improved rate performance and a long life.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121439
Enhancement of structural and optical properties of transparent sodium zinc phosphate glass–ceramics nano composite,"© 2022, The Author(s).Transparent sodium phosphate glass–ceramics system according to the composition (55-x) P2O5.(30 + x)ZnO.15Na2O where x = 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 was prepared with the melt quenching technique. Different techniques such as XRD and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to investigate the structure of the studied glass samples and glass–ceramics nano composite. XRD revealed the formation of crystalline phase. The crystalline phase of Na2Zn (P2O7) and Na2ZnP2O7.Zn2P2O7 has been detected which varies according to the ZnO concentration. The density increased whereas molar volume decreased as ZnO content was increased. Optical band gap values, direct and indirect, decreased with increasing ZnO content revealing that bridging oxygen linkage Zn–O-P present in the glass network. The band gaps were found to be ranging between 3.42 and 3.13 eV for indirect transition and ranging between 4.34 and 4.20 eV for direct transitions. It was concluded that the samples have a strong tendency to be crystallized with increasing ZnO content in the sample. This crystallization behavior with increasing the ZnO content affected the structure and optical properties of the prepared samples. In this work, a low cost, wide band gap transparent ceramic with wide range of transparency was prepared and investigated. Such glass–ceramic system is suitable for doping with rare-earth element and/or transition metals for laser and optical devices.",Journal of the Australian Ceramic Society,10.1007/s10854-022-07937-z
Effect of BaF2 and CaF2 on properties of Tb3+-doped yellow phosphorus slag luminescent glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A new type of Tb3+-doped luminescent glass-ceramics was prepared with yellow phosphorus slag. The effects of BaF2 and CaF2 on the crystallization and luminescence performance of glass-ceramics were explored. Results indicated that Tb3+ was 2 wt%; as the amount of BaF2 and CaF2 increased, the crystallization activation energy weakly decreased, which promoted crystallization. The crystallization mechanism changed from bulk to surface with the addition of BaF2, but the Avrami parameters of addition with CaF2 were all greater than 3, they were volume growth. With the increase of BaF2 and CaF2, the crystal structures change from short columnar to needle-like and from crisscross short rods to islands, respectively. BaF2 did not promote Tb3+ ion luminescence but instead reduced the fluorescence intensity. The addition of CaF2 the luminous intensity first increased and then decreased. When 2 wt% CaF2 was added, the luminous intensity was the highest.",Optical Materials,10.1007/s41779-022-00719-0
Role of molybdenum in material immunomodulation and periodontal wound healing: Targeting immunometabolism and mitochondrial function for macrophage modulation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdRecently, strategies that can target the underlying mechanisms of phenotype change to modulate the macrophage immune response from the standpoint of biological science have attracted increasing attention in the field of biomaterials. In this study, we printed a molybdenum-containing bioactive glass ceramic (Mo-BGC) scaffold as an immunomodulatory material. In a clinically relevant critical-size periodontal defect model, the defect-matched scaffold featured robust immunomodulatory activity, enabling long-term stable macrophage modulation and leading to enhanced regeneration of multiple periodontal tissues in canines. Further studies demonstrated that the regeneration-enhancing function of Mo-BGC scaffold was macrophage-dependent by using canines with host macrophage depletion. To investigate the role of Mo in material immunomodulation, in vitro investigations were performed and revealed that Mo-BGC powder extract, similar to MoO42−-containing medium, induced M2 polarization by enhancing the mitochondrial function of macrophages and promoted a cell metabolic shift from glycolysis toward mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate for the first time an immunomodulatory role of a Mo-containing material in the dynamic cascade of wound healing. By targeting the immunometabolism and mitochondrial function of macrophages, Mo-mediated immunomodulation provides new avenues for future material design in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",Biomaterials,10.1007/s41779-022-00715-4
"Preparation, microstructure and ionic conductivity of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3/50Li2O–50P2O5 glass ceramic electrolytes","© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.NASICON-type structured compound Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) was regarded as a potential solid electrolyte material due to its high ionic conductivity. Herein, the sintering properties, microstructure and ionic conductivity behavior of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3/50Li2O–50P2O5(LATP/LP) glass ceramics, prepared through a solid phase method, were investigated for lithium battery applications. The influences of sintering temperatures and LP contents on the microstructure, phase composition and electrical properties of glass ceramics were systematically studied using DSC, TG, XRD, SEM, Raman spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy. The results show that main crystal phase LiTi2(PO4)3 exists in all glass ceramic samples, and no derivative phase is observed. The addition of LP frits improves the sintering of ceramics and increases the density, but does not change the crystal structure. Especially, the 3 wt% LP added glass ceramic sintered at 850 °C exhibits the highest ionic conductivity of 8.2 × 10–4 S/cm and a low activation energy of 0.263 eV.

Crystallization behaviors and properties of Ti-bearing blast furnace slag-based glass ceramics with varying CaO/SiO2 mass ratio,"© 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Australian Ceramic Society.The effect of CaO/SiO2 ratio on the crystallization behaviors, mechanical properties, and acid and alkali resistance properties of the prepared Ti-bearing blast furnace slag-based glass ceramics were investigated. The results showed that the crystallization temperature obviously decreased with the increase of CaO/SiO2 ratio, and the higher CaO/SiO2 ratios leaded to stronger crystallization ability. The main crystal phases transformed from CaAl2Si2O8 and CaMgSi2O6 to CaAl2Si2O8, CaMgSi2O6, and Ca2MgSi2O7 as the CaO/SiO2 ratio increased from 0.3 to 0.6. When the CaO/SiO2 increased to 0.5, a small amount of akermanite precipitated. The vickers hardness gradually decreased, and the flexural strength first increased and then decreased with an increased CaO/SiO2. The glass ceramic with CaO/SiO2 = 0.5 exhibited the highest flexural strength of 109.58 MPa. The prepared glass ceramics showed good acid and alkali resistance (> 98.30%), especially alkali resistance. Therefore, the best candidate for CaO/SiO2 ratio in the investigated Ti-bearing blast furnace slag-based glass ceramics was selected as 0.5. This work can provide the reference for preparation slag-based glass ceramics.",Journal of the Australian Ceramic Society,10.1007/s10854-022-07929-z
Comparative study on thermal cyclic resistance of glass–ceramic-bonded TBC system and conventional TBC system,"© 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Australian Ceramic Society.Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are provided to protect the metallic parts of gas turbines from high inlet temperature. In the present study, two types of TBCs, namely conventional TBC having NiCoCrAlY bond coat, 8-YSZ top coat and a new TBC with glass–ceramic bond coat keeping the top coat same, were considered to investigate their thermal cyclic resistance at 1000℃ for 500 cycles. Assessment of weight change, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis were performed for both TBCs after thermal cycling. Weight change measurement indicated that oxidative weight gain dominated over the coating spallation in case of conventional TBCs. On the contrary, oxidative weight gain could not considerably govern over coating spallation for glass–ceramic bond–coated TBCs. Furthermore, thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer was not observed at the bond coat–top coat interface of glass–ceramic bond–coated TBC system whereas the same was observed clearly at the interfacial region of bond coat and top coat of conventional TBC system after completion of 500 cycles at 1000 °C.",Journal of the Australian Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jdent.2022.104054
Nanostructured thermoelectric composites for efficient energy harvesting in infrastructure construction applications,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdAlthough numerous investigations have been performed on thermoelectric (TE) fields, no notable studies have been conducted on TE structural materials. In this study, the electrical characteristics of cement were induced by incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Although cement can serve as a TE material owing to its low thermal conductivity, its extremely low electrical conductivity hinders its feasible application. The introduction of cement composites containing small amounts of CNTs is suggested as a solution. CNTs can improve the TE performance of cement-based composites because they exhibit superior electrical conductivity and are suitable as additives for carbon isotope-based composites. Such composite materials can be used as TE structural materials for energy harvesting in buildings. Therefore, to analyze the feasibility of the cement/CNT composites, the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity were measured by varying the CNT concentration using 4-probe measurement and ASTM D5470 methods. The electrical conductivity was improved by approximately 104 times as the CNT concentration increased from 0.0625 to 0.25 wt% while maintaining a relatively stable Seebeck coefficient, whereas the thermal conductivity remained in the insulating material region. The results showed that the critical CNT concentration associated with the percolation threshold was relatively low (∼0.1 wt%). This study may contribute to the development of self-powered sensor systems in buildings based on structural temperature differences.",Cement and Concrete Composites,10.1111/ijag.16556
Preparation and luminescence properties of Tb3+-doped glass ceramics containing Ba3Gd(PO4)3,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Tb3+-doped transparent glass ceramics (GCs) containing Ba3Gd(PO4)3 crystal phase were prepared by the melting crystallization method. The heat treatment condition for GCs was determined as 740 °C/2 h by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmittance curves. The optical energy bandgap values of glass ceramics (Eg=2.58 eV) are lesser than glass (Eg=3.47 eV). The fluorescence emission intensity results determined that the optimum doping concentration of Tb3+ was 0.4%. The reason for the concentration quenching is electrical multipolar interaction. It is notable that the emission intensity of Tb3+ with the same doping concentration in glass ceramics is stronger than that in precursor glass. The mechanism of enhanced luminescence is also discussed. The chromaticity coordinates move from the blue light region to the green light region with the change of concentration of Tb3+. Therefore, Tb3+-doped glass ceramics containing Ba3Gd(PO4)3 phase have color tunability and potential application value in solid-state lighting field.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.02.055
"Lithium disilicate and zirconia reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramics for CAD/CAM dental restorations: biocompatibility, mechanical and microstructural properties after crystallization","© 2022Objectives: The objective of this study was to define the impact of heating rate on the crystal growth, the mechanical properties, and the biocompatibility of three different kinds of CAD/CAM glass-ceramics treated with a conventional furnace. Methods: Lithium disilicate (IPS EMax-CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) (LS2) and two zirconia reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) ceramics (Vita Suprinity PC, VITA Zahnfabrik; Celtra Duo, Dentsply Sirona) (ZLSS; ZLSC) were used. The mechanical properties and the crystal growth were evaluated on 42 specimens (n = 14 per group). The thermal treatments recommended by the manufacturers were carried out. All groups were tested for fracture toughness (Ft) and Vickers hardness (Hv). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken after a slight surface etching with hydrofluoric acid solution (1% for 20 s). Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) was performed and cellular adhesion with human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) culture was qualitatively assayed. Data were analyzed with Repeated Measurements ANOVA and ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test. Results: The crystals’ mean size (±SD) after heat treatment was 1650.0 (±340.0) nm for LS2, 854.5 (±155.0) nm for ZLSS and 759.9 (±118.4) nm for ZLSC (p < 0.05 among the groups). As consequence of crystallization, the Hv was 6.1 ± 0.3 GPa for LS2, 7.6 ± 0.7 GPa for ZLSS and 7.1 ± 0.5 GPa for ZLSC (p < 0.05 for LS2 vs ZLSS and ZLSC), while the Ft was 2.2 ± 0.1 MPa m1/2 for LS2, 4.7 ± 0.8 MPa m1/2 for ZLSS and 3.8 ± 0.6 MPa m1/2 for ZLSC (p < 0.05 among the groups). The DTA curves showed a crystallization process for LS2, ZLSS and ZLSC at a temperature range 810–840 °C. The amount of adherent hPDLSCs was superior on LS2 than on ZLS. Conclusions: All the CAD/CAM materials can be properly crystallized if heat treated following the manufacturers’ instructions. The crystallization process highly depends on temperature. ZLS glass ceramics show significantly inferior crystals dimensions and higher fracture toughness and Vickers hardness than LS2 ceramic. hPDLSCs cultured on LS2 have a superior adhesion than those cultured on ZLS. Clinical significance: The value of this study relies on the demonstration that a proper heat-treatment of CAD/CAM lithium disilicate and ZLS glass ceramics generates products that are suitable for clinical use . The differences highlightable in mechanical properties and biocompatibility behavior do not affect their successful clinical application.",Journal of Dentistry,10.1016/j.ijleo.2022.168700

Additionally, the spectroscopic properties of Nd3+ ions were analyzed using Judd-Ofelt theory. UV–Vis and Near-IR absorption spectra of glass composite samples reveal eleven significant peaks. Under the excitation of 808 nm laser diode, three near-IR emission bands are at around 876 nm, 1058 nm and 1331 nm from 4F3/2 → 4I9/2, 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 radiative transitions, respectively, were observed in the Nd3+ ions doped glass composite material. The lifetimes of this transition has been experimentally determined through decay profile studies. For all Nd3+ ion concentrations, the decay time curves of the 4F3/2 level were essentially single exponential.",Optik,10.1016/j.jssc.2022.122927
Polymer-supported NiWO4 nanocomposites for visible light degradation of toxic dyes,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.In this work, NiWO4 and polymer-based NiWO4 nanocomposites were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The structure and functional groups of the composite materials were analysed by XRD and FTIR spectroscopy. HRTEM analysis confirms the composite materials with nanoplate-like morphology. Then the optical property was examined by UV–Visible spectroscopy. The polymeric materials of Polyaniline (PA) and Polypyrrole are composited with NiWO4 and act as electron trap charge carriers and inhibit the fast electron recombination in the photocatalytic degradation of toxic dyes. The polymer-supported NiWO4 excellently displays the competent electron–hole pairs separation and enhancement of light-reaping performance, thus reveals improved photocatalytic activity of toxic dyes. The crystal violet and methylene blue dyes were used for photocatalytic degradation of toxic dyes. The NiWO4/PA exhibits closely 94% degradation efficiency for both crystal violet and methylene blue dyes. This facilitates enhanced photocatalytic performance and prepared composite material used for wastewater treatment.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121436
Energy transfer from Bi3+ to Mn2+ doped in oxyfluoride glass and transparent glass-ceramics containing KMgF3,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The equivalent or hetero-valent substitution of ions in a host is an efficient method for stimulating photoluminescence tuning to optimize the photoluminescence performances in phosphor materials. The study of Bi3+/Mn2+ co-doped oxides is currently of interest to solve the lack of red-orange components in commercials phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes. In this article, we designed KMgF3 perovskite glass-ceramics that the Mg cation substitute by Bi3+/Mn2+, based on the radius and coordination of the cations and heat-treatment through solid-state microwave reaction. The photoluminescence (PL) determined and were systematically characterized. In contrast, the doped Bi3+/Mn2+ ions can be effectively doped in the KMgF3 in the glassy matrix. The prepared glass and glass-ceramics co-doped Bi3+/Mn2+ glasses exhibit intense tunable emitting color between blue and orange-red regions due to an efficient energy transfer from Bi3+ to Mn2+.",Journal of Solid State Chemistry,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121437
Optical thermometry of Tm3+/Yb3+ Co-doped Ba3Gd2F12 up-conversion glass-ceramic with high sensitivity,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.In this work, Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doped Ba3Gd2F12 oxyfluoride glass-ceramic was synthesized by the conventional melt-quenching method, and an optical thermometer with high sensitivity was proposed accordingly. The structural and optical properties of Ba3Gd2F12: Tm3+/Yb3+ glass-ceramics were systematically investigated. After crystallization, the enrichment of Tm3+ ions in the Ba3Gd2F12 lattice leads to enhancing emission intensity, the prolonged lifetime of Tm3+ ions, and Stark splitting of emission spectra. The dependence of optical properties of Ba3Gd2F12: Tm3+ glass-ceramics on temperature were explored based on fluorescence intensity ratio of 3F2,3 ​→ ​3H6 and 1G4→3F4 transitions of Tm3+ ions. The maximum value of relative sensitivity SR reaches 1.02% K−1 at 457 ​K. This work indicates that the oxyfluoride glass-ceramic embedded with Ba3Gd2F12: Tm3+/Yb3+ nanoparticles is a candidate material with good performance for optical temperature sensors.",Journal of Solid State Chemistry,10.1007/s00170-022-08695-2

Using the device of X-ray diffraction (XRD) can confirm Ca2Ti2O6 nanocrystals were formed among the precursor glass matrix. Under the optimum heat treatment condition (680 °C/90 min), the average grain size in the glass-ceramic is about 103 nm, and the light transmittance in the visible region can reach 78%. Under 402 nm excitation, the emission spectra show strong emission peaks at 564 nm, 600 nm and 647 nm, corresponding to the 4G5/2→6HJ (J = 5/2, 7/2, 9/2) characteristic transitions of Sm3+. The optimal doping concentration of Sm3+ is 0.5%, and the concentration quenching caused by exchange interaction will occur if it exceeds this value. The introduction of Li+ into glass-ceramics will not change the crystal phase and can enhance the luminescent intensity.

Micro-grooving of brittle materials using textured diamond grinding wheels shaped by an integrated nanosecond laser system,"© 2022, The Author(s).Freeform surfaces including both the aspherical and prismatic concave/convex have been widely utilized in optical, electronical, and biomedical areas. Most recently, it is reported that grinding with structured wheels provides new possibility to generate patterns on hard and brittle materials. This paper reports the latest research progress on micro-grooving glass ceramic using laser structured diamond grinding wheels. A nanosecond pulse laser is firstly integrated into an ultra-precision machine tool and used for the in-line conditioning of super abrasive grinding wheels, i.e., truing, dressing, and profiling/texturing. Meanwhile, an offset compensation method, considering the shifting depth of focus (DoF) at different laser irradiation positions, is proposed to accurately generate various profiles on the periphery of the grinding wheels. Three types of patterns (riblets, grooves, and pillars) are successfully fabricated on the ceramic substrate using the laser textured grinding wheels. The results indicate that the integrated laser system offers high flexibility and accuracy in shaping super abrasive grinding wheels, and the grinding using textured grinding wheels provides a promising solution to generate functional microstructures on hard and brittle materials.",International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.131694
Fracture toughness and hardness of transparent MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramics,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Hard and strong transparent glass-ceramics (TGCs) can be used as cooktop plates, telescope mirrors, armor materials, and screens for smartphones and tablets. In this work, transparent glass-ceramics from the MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 (MAS) system were obtained after a refined heat-treatment protocol.

Preparation and performance of rGO coating on C/C composite finger seal with femtosecond laser,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In order to improve the oxidation resistance of a carbon/carbon (C/C) composite finger seal in high-temperature environments, a high-repetition frequency femtosecond laser was used to prepare a graphene coating on the surface of the C/C composite finger seal by reducing the graphene oxide (GO). The experimental results indicate that the multilayer reduced graphene oxide (rGO) formed has a gauze-like morphology and good transparency. The rGO coating with stable chemical properties effectively covers the surface fibers of the C/C composites and fills the pores, which enhances the compactness of the matrix and improves the high-temperature oxidation resistance of the C/C composite finger seal. This process method might improve the service life and reliability of components made of C/C composites under high-temperature environments.",Materials Letters,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.131700
"Glass-ceramic crystallization from tailings of the Morille tungsten deposit, Spain","© 2022 The Author(s)The potential of the tailings from the Morille scheelite-bearing calc-silicate deposit as a commercial raw material for inert glass–ceramic was determined.

The effect of phase formation on biomechanical and biological performance of Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramics,"© 2021Lithium aluminum silicate (LAS, Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2) glass-ceramics have been employed in dentistry as substitutes while seldom in orthopaedics. This is primarily due to difficulties with balancing the biomechanical and biological performance. This study aims to investigate the effects of SiO2 content and thermal treatment on the formation of Li2SiO3, Li2Si2O5 and LiAlSi2O6 in LAS glass-ceramics, and the effects of these crystalline phases on the biomechanical and biological performance. The preparation of LAS glass-ceramics were divided into two stages. In the first step, six components (C1, C2, C21, C22, C23 and C3) of LAS glass-ceramics were prepared and characterized. In the second step, the CN1, CN2 and CN3 with the principal phases of Li2SiO3, Li2Si2O5 and LiAlSi2O6 were obtained based on the C1, C22 and C3 and evaluated in biomechanics and biology. With the content of SiO2 increasing from 65.11% to 67.96%, the formation of Li2Si2O5 and LiAlSi2O6 correspondently increased. The extension of the holding time at 850 °C promoted the generation of LiAlSi2O6 at the expense of Li2Si2O5. The main crystalline phase coupled with Li2Si2O5 and LiAlSi2O6 (dominated by LiAlSi2O6) resulted in a high flexural strength of 378 ± 29 MPa and favorable cell viability of 115.21 ± 14.63%.

Recent trends in recycling and reusing techniques of different plastic polymers and their composite materials,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The rising environmental concerns caused by the excess use of synthetic materials have diverted the world's attention towards sustainable materials along with a circular economy approach using recycling routes. Nowadays, composite materials have been enormously utilized in different industrial sectors, thus, causing serious accumulation of plastic waste in the environment. The end-of-life (EOL) treatments for plastic composites are imperative as these materials cannot be easily disposed of. The recycling methodologies adopted for polymer composites have two major advantages. Firstly, recycling techniques control plastic composite waste consumption. Secondly, the energy required in the recycling of plastic composite materials is quite low, compared to conventional manufacturing techniques. In this review, we highlight some recent recycling and reusing techniques adopted for plastics and their composite materials. Among all the reported recycling techniques for polymer composites, thermal recycling is best suited for the recycling of carbon fibers (CFs) and glass fibers (GFs). Through thermal recycling, the properties of recycled materials can meet the properties of virgin materials and energy is significantly lower than chemical recycling. However, mechanical recycling requires very low energy for the recycling of composites as compared to the other recycling process. It was concluded that the composite materials consumption in different industries would only be justified when recycling and reusing of composites should be given equal consideration. Additionally, the recycling of polymer composites will boost the circular economy.",Sustainable Materials and Technologies,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.12.085
Effects of dopants with various valences on densification behavior and phase composition of a ZrO2–SiO2 nanocrystalline glass-ceramic,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Effects of dopants with different valences on the densification behavior and phase composition of a ZrO2–SiO2 nanocrystalline glass-ceramic (NCGC) during pressureless sintering were investigated in this study. The raw powder of Ca2+, La3+, Ce4+ and Ta5+ ions doped ZrO2–SiO2 (referred to as Ca-ZS, La-ZS, Ce-ZS, Ta-ZS, respectively) and pure ZrO2–SiO2 (PZS) sample were synthesized by sol-gel method, followed by pressureless sintering. Compared with the PZS sample, doping of Ca2+ and La3+ ions significantly promoted the densification of the NCGCs. The “densification promotion” effect was attributed to the formation of oxygen vacancies and the decrease of SiO2 viscosity due to doping of aliovalent cations. The dopants with various valences showed significant effects on the phase compositions of the NCGCs during sintering. Doping of Ca2+ ion accelerated the reaction kinetics between ZrO2 nanocrystallites and amorphous SiO2 to yield ZrSiO4. The La3+ ion acted as destabilizer of t-ZrO2, which resulted in a rapid tetragonal (t) to monoclinic (m) ZrO2 phase transformation during sintering, while in the Ta5+ and Ce4+ ions doped sample, the phase transformation occurred gradually. All the doping ions increased the lattice parameters and the volume of t-ZrO2 unit cell, while the effects of the doping ions on the lattice parameters of m-ZrO2 unit cell were more complex.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.12.009
"Doping of tantalum, niobium, and hafnium in a translucent ZrO2-SiO2 nanocrystalline glass-ceramic","© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe addition of dopant(s) is an effective strategy to regulate the microstructure and properties of ZrO2-based ceramics. In this study, we investigated the effects of ternary element alloying, namely tantalum (Ta), niobium (Nb), and hafnium (Hf) elements, on the microstructure and transformability of ZrO2 nanocrystallites in a ZrO2-SiO2 nanocrystalline glass-ceramic (NCGC) during sintering and thermal treatments. The ternary dopants enhanced the transformability of tetragonal ZrO2 (t-ZrO2) nanocrystallites during sintering, i.e., the dopants acted as t-ZrO2 destabilizer. The Ta, Nb and Hf elements dissolved in ZrO2 nanocrystallites, forming ZrO2 solid solution. Meanwhile, lamella nanotwins were formed within many ZrO2 nanocrystallites. No obvious segregation of dopants was detected at ZrO2 grain boundaries. t-ZrO2 and monoclinic (m) ZrO2 nanocrystallites were metastable in thermal treatments process, with “t” to “m” and the reverse “m” to “t” polymorphic transformation occurred simultaneously. Meanwhile, t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2 nanocrystallites had a great tendency to grow larger during thermal treatments.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.12.095
Physical and structural characteristics of sol–gel derived CaO–B2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramics and their dielectric properties in the 5G millimeter-wave bands,"© 2021In this study, sol–gel derived CaO–B2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramics with a set B2O3 content of 22.2 mol% and CaO/SiO2 ratios ranging between 0.15 and 0.27 were used for low-temperature cofired ceramic applications in the 5G millimeter-wave bands. X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy data indicated that, unlike the typical CaO–B2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramics prepared via melting resulted in the presence of calcium silicates, the CaO–B2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramics in this study comprised only an amorphous phase containing different amounts of CaB2O4 crystallites depending on the CaO/SiO2 ratio. Among the formulations evaluated, the 14.5CaO‒22.2B2O3‒63.3SiO2 glass-ceramic sintered at 950 °C exhibited a dielectric constant of 4.33 and a dielectric loss of 0.0012 at 60 GHz, which conferred its low signal propagation delay and low signal attenuation in applications. In addition, the electrical resistivity, breakdown strength, thermal conductivity, and coefficient of thermal expansion of the 14.5CaO‒22.2B2O3‒63.3SiO2 glass-ceramic were 1.72 × 1012 Ω cm, 15.49 kV/mm, 1.70 W/mK, and 4.1 ppm/°C, respectively. The 14.5CaO‒22.2B2O3‒63.3SiO2 glass-ceramic exhibited excellent insulating properties, facilitating its use as substrate material; moreover, its thermal properties matched those of Si and GaAs.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.12.093
"Nucleation mechanisms in a SiO2-Li2O-P2O5-ZrO2 biomedical glass-ceramic: Insights on crystallisation, residual glasses and Zr4+ structural environment","© 2021 Elsevier LtdIn manufacturing reliable glass-ceramics, bulk chemistry and appropriate thermal treatments are critical points. To better understand the influence of nucleation parameters on the crystallisation behaviour and mechanical properties of multicomponent glass-ceramics, we studied the effects of time and temperature on phase stabilisation, the evolution of the crystal phases and physical properties of a Zr-rich lithium-silicate having a SiO2/Li2O molar ratio < 2. Here, we also provide insights into the structural environment of Zr4+ at the early stage of nucleation by Anomalous X-ray Scattering (AXS). By reverse-engineering a commercial material through remelting and sequential thermal treatments, we observed the strong effect of the nucleation temperature on the final mineral assemblage and of the volume fractions of the lithium-disilicate phase on the fracture toughness (KIc). Indeed, the KIc value was increased from ∼0.8 MPa.m½ in the pristine glass up to ∼ 2 MPa.m½, if compared to the original commercial material exhibiting a KIc value of 1.6 MPa.m½. Furthermore, the synthesis of residual glasses at different stages of the thermal treatments allowed us to observe the changes in the glass network structure and properties. AXS was used to extract the contribution exclusively coming from Zr for different nucleation steps. The differential pair distribution functions ΔZrg(r) show two distinct peaks at ∼2.10 Å and 3.44 Å, respectively associated with Zr-O and Zr-Zr/Zr-Si correlations with the formation of edge sharing in addition to corner sharing polyhedra. It was discerned the occurrence of (sub)nano-sized clusters enriched in Zr. These local clusters do not show changes during the different thermal treatments, either for higher temperatures or longer times. No Zr phases are stabilised in the crystallised materials, suggesting that these clusters do not evolve above the critical nucleus size. All evidence points to a highly heterogeneous environment and the coexistence of three structural regions i) (sub)nano Zr-clusters, ii) P enriched μ-areas, iii) residual silicate glass. The evolution and spatial distribution of these units influence the final properties.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1007/s10971-021-05678-9
Additive manufacturing of Ca–Mg silicate scaffolds supported by flame-synthesized glass microspheres,"© 2021Novel manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing also referred to as 3D printing hold a critical role in the preparation of novel bioactive three-dimensional glass-ceramic scaffolds. The present paper focuses on the use of Ca–Mg silicates microspheres (Ca2MgSi2O7, i.e. 40 mol% CaO, 20% MgO and 40% SiO2) for the fabrication of 3D structures by additive manufacturing. In the first step, the crystallization of the åkermanite system was avoided, by feeding nearly fully crystallized precursor powders prepared by conventional melt quenching into oxygen-methane (O2/CH4) torch, and solid glass microspheres (SGMs) with diameters bellow 63 μm were prepared. In the second step, the crystallization was utilized to control the viscous flow of SGMs during firing of reticulated scaffolds, obtained by digital light processing (DLP) of the SGMs suspended in a photocurable acrylate binder. The spheroidal shape facilitated a high solid content, up to 77 wt% of the SGMs in the suspension. After burn-out of the organic binder, a fast sintering treatment at 950 °C, for 30 min, led to scaffolds preserving the macro-porosity from 3D printing model (diamond cell lattice) but with well densified struts. The crystallization of 3D scaffolds during the sintering process led to 3D structures with adequate strength-to-density ratio.",Ceramics International,10.1111/jace.18256
Microstructure and enhanced electromagnetic wave absorbing performance of Zn0.6Ni0.3Cu0.1Fe2O4 ferrite glass-ceramic,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Here we introduce a controllable route for the efficient synthesis of Zn0.6Ni0.3Cu0.1Fe2O4 ferrite glass-ceramic with enhanced electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbing performance. By adding a certain amount of Zn, Ni, Cu and Fe oxides into the SiO2–Al2O3–B2O3–CaO-R2O glass system, the microstructure of three-dimensional dendritic ferrites combined with amorphous SiO2-rich phase is constructed through a high-temperature melt and quenching route. The good EMW absorption performance is attributed to the unique combination of amorphous glass and spinel ferrite, which improves the impedance matching of the material and absorbs EMW by the dielectric loss and magnetic loss. Moreover, the dendritic ferrite crystal phase is compounded with the SiO2-rich amorphous phase to form grain boundaries and crystal-amorphous interfaces, which enhances the interfacial polarization and builds multiple transmission-absorption mechanisms. The results show that the reflection loss peak value of the glass-ceramics containing 60 wt% Zn0.6Ni0.3Cu0.1Fe2O4 spinel is −42.16 dB with the sample thickness of 2 mm, and the effective absorption band range (reflection loss ≤ -10 dB) is 3.76 GHz (13.6–17.36 GHz) at 1.5 mm. This approach presents a scalable and low-cost solution that may be applied to the design of high-efficiency EMW consumption components in the future.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.11.035
Lanthanide–based luminescent hybrid silica materials prepared by sol-gel methodologies: a review,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Research in the field of lanthanide-based luminescent hybrid silica materials has grown substantially in the last decades, given the unique spectroscopic properties of lanthanide(III) complexes and the stability and biocompatibility of silica hosts. The versatility of the sol-gel technique to produce glasses, fibers, films, nanoparticles and ceramics has turned it into one of the most powerful methods to achieve such goals. This review describes the most commonly used sol-gel strategies to insert a luminescent lanthanide(III) complex inside a silica host and their potential applications, with the aim to help in the choice for a particular functional material. In particular, the focus is set on the different approaches developed to embed the visible or near infrared emitting guest in the silica matrix, either by entrapment within the three-dimensional network, anchoring on the surface of a nano or microparticle or inclusion in a mesopore. In addition, the usual organic ligands and the different functionalization strategies are discussed.

Structural dependence of crystallization in phosphorus-containing sodium aluminoborosilicate glasses,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyThe article reports on the structural dependence of crystallization in Na2O–Al2O3–B2O3–P2O5–SiO2-based glasses over a broad compositional space. The structure of melt-quenched glasses has been investigated using 11B, 27Al, 29Si, and 31P magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy, while the crystallization behavior has been followed using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy. In general, the integration of phosphate into the sodium aluminoborosilicate network is mainly accomplished via the formation of Al–O–P and B–O–P linkages with the possibility of formation of Si–O–P linkages playing only a minor role. In terms of crystallization, at low concentrations (≤5 mol.%), P2O5 promotes the crystallization of nepheline (NaAlSiO4), while at higher concentrations (≥10 mol.%), it tends to suppress (completely or incompletely depending on the glass chemistry) the crystallization in glasses. When correlating the structure of glasses with their crystallization behavior, the MAS NMR results highlight the importance of the substitution/replacement of Si–O–Al linkages by Al–O–P, Si–O–B, and B–O–P linkages in the suppression of nepheline crystallization in glasses. The results have been discussed in the context of (1) the problem of nepheline crystallization in Hanford high-level waste glasses and (2) designing vitreous waste forms for the immobilization of phosphate-rich dehalogenated Echem salt waste.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.11.021
Solid-state field-assisted ion exchange of Ag in lithium aluminum silicate glass-ceramics: A superfast processing route toward stronger materials with antimicrobial properties,"© 2021Lithium-aluminum-silicate glass-ceramics (LAS) are of pivotal relevance in various applications as they combine excellent mechanical and functional properties. Due to their use in medical devices and cooking articles, antimicrobial properties are obviously of interest. Herein, we report the solid-state field-assisted (Ag→Li,Na) ion exchange in LAS glass-ceramics containing β-quartz and β-spodumene solid solutions. The ion-exchange is extremely rapid and deep silver penetration (>100 μm) can be achieved within a few minutes (<5 min), this being proportional to the treating time and applied current. The elemental profiles are characterized by a relatively complex shape which reflects the different alkali mobility in the different phases. The ion exchange initiates structural modifications involving: (i) β→α transition in spodumene; (ii) formation of lattice microstrain and quartz cell expansion; (iii) substantial changes in the IR absorption spectra. The obtained materials possess improved resistance to crack formation and antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.pmatsci.2021.100890

In this frame, 3D printing is a fast and low-cost innovative technique and its capability to produce fibre-reinforced polymer matrix composites widely opens the application possibilities. 3D printing technology can form also composite materials made by short fibres that can be exploited for manufacturing parts and structures in high-tech sectors such as aerospace, automotive or naval, to cite some. Here we show how a multimodal approach can furnish a whole characterisation of reinforced composites produced with a 3D printing technology during and after tensile and flexural tests. In the multimodal strategy, we employed a couple of full-field and non-contact optical techniques, i.e. 2D-Digital-Image-Correlation (2D-DIC) and Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) in combination with SEM and optical microscope for analysing the sample at the micro and macroscale. The result of the work allows us to achieve a complete characterisation of the components realized by 3D printing.",Optics and Lasers in Engineering,10.1111/ijag.16541
Influence of Ca/Al ratio on physical and dielectric properties of Al2O3/CaO-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramics composite coatings prepared by high enthalpy atmospheric plasma spraying,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe dielectric layer plays a key role in regulating electromagnetic wave broadband scattering based on meta-surface technology. Herein, the physical properties of composite powder, prepared by spray drying of CaO-B2O3-SiO2 (CBS) glass-ceramic powder and Al2O3 in different mass ratios, are systematically investigated. Meanwhile, a high enthalpy atmospheric plasma spraying equipment is utilized to prepare CBS/Al2O3 composite coatings, and the morphology, physical properties and dielectric properties of the composite coating are analyzed. The XRD and DSC data of the composite coating reveal that the crystallization behavior of β-CaSiO3 and CaB2O4 gradually disappear with the increase of Al2O3 content. Hence, only CaAl2Si2O8 phase is observed during heat treatment. The experimental results confirm that the dielectric properties of CBS/Al2O3 composite coating conform to the rule of mixture for composite materials. Also, the dielectric properties are affected by porosity and crystallization rate.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1111/jerd.12828
Transparent tellurite glass-ceramics for photonics applications: A comprehensive review on crystalline phases and crystallization mechanisms,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdTransparent tellurite glass-ceramics are the new revolution in the photonics era. The novelty of transparent tellurite glass-ceramics (TTGCs) originates from the formation of unique nanostructured crystalline phases which are otherwise unfeasible to compose. Tellurite glass already has the advantage of possessing low host phonon energy which further gets lowered around the local environment of dopant ions upon crystallization. Nevertheless, the flexibility of compositional modification in glasses opens up the opportunity of different crystalline phase precipitation with unique structure and properties. Moreover, the achievement of control over the heat-treatment process helps to attain the glass-ceramics with retention of optical transparency. Most importantly, when the glass-ceramics are doped with rare earths (RE), its capability of playing an intriguing role in the wide photonics field depends on preferential position of dopants in glass-ceramics, either at glassy phase or crystalline phase. Thus, we are aspiring to bring out an overview of important families of transparent tellurite glass-ceramics studied up to date with an in-depth analysis of crystalline phases along with profound survey about their micro/nano-structure and unique properties. After a thorough investigation, the shortcomings of these works are also highlighted along with mentioning the future application of these materials for further improvement.",Progress in Materials Science,10.1111/jopr.13415
Crystallization kinetics and photoluminescence studies on SiO2-ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ glass ceramics,"© 2021 The American Ceramic Society and Wiley Periodicals LLC.SiO2-ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ glass ceramics were prepared by a sol-gel method. The influence of TiO2 addition on the crystallization behavior and photoluminescence properties were investigated in detail. The nonisothermal crystallization kinetic studies based on Kissinger, Ozawa, and Matusita models were performed on the SiO2-ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ glasses with different amount of TiO2. The introducing of TiO2 component as nucleant in the glasses can significantly reduce the crystallization activation energy. The results of the crystallization kinetic calculation and scanning electronic microscope observations indicated that the crystallization of ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ from the glass possessed a surface nucleation and growth mechanism. Near infrared emission of the glass ceramics was obtained under the excitation at 414 nm. The crystal field parameters around Cr3+ and excited state dynamics of Cr3+ were studied in detailed.",International Journal of Applied Glass Science,10.1007/s10854-021-06804-7
Wear behavior of current computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing composites and reinforced high performance polymers: An in vitro study,"© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Objective: To analyze the wear rate of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) composites, polyetheretherketones and glass ceramics. Material and Methods: Our study groups were prepared from two different resin-based composites (Brillant Crios, Cerasmart), a glass ceramic (IPS Emax CAD) and reinforced polyetheretherketone (BioHPP) material (n = 10). Premolar teeth were used as antagonists. The specimens, which were subjected to two body wear tests (240,000 cycles, 1.2 Hz, 50N) in the chewing simulator, were scanned with a 3D laser scanner both before and after the wear test. Volume loss and wear depth were determined by means of the obtained images software program. The wear pattern was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Kruskal Wallis test served for analyzing. Results: The least volume loss and wear depth were seen in the polyetheretherketone material (0.06 ± 0.04 mm3, 0.02 ± 0.01 mm), while the maximum volume loss was seen in the groups containing resin-based composite. (p = 0.05). The volume loss value in glass ceramics is between CAD/CAM composites and polyetheretherketone. Conclusion: The behavior of polyetheretherketone against enamel was different from glass ceramics and composite materials in terms of the amount of wear. Clinical Significance: Polyetheretheketone can be considered as an alternative to other chairside materials in terms of wear resistance.",Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry,10.1111/jopr.13404
Fracture Resistance of Single-Unit Implant-Supported Crowns: Effects of Prosthetic Design and Restorative Material,"© 2021 by the American College of Prosthodontists.Purpose: To evaluate the fracture resistance and fracture patterns of single implant-supported crowns with different prosthetic designs and materials. Materials and Methods: One hundred and forty-four identical crowns were fabricated from zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS), leucite-based (LGC), and lithium disilicate (LDS) glass-ceramics, reinforced composite (RC), translucent zirconia (ZR), and ceramic-reinforced polyetheretherketone (P). These crowns were divided into 3 subgroups according to restoration design: cementable crowns on a prefabricated titanium abutment, cement-retained crown on a zirconia-titanium base abutment, and screw-cement crown (n = 8). After adhesive cementation, restorations were subjected to thermal-cycling and loaded until fracture. The fracture patterns were evaluated under a stereomicroscope. Statistical analysis was performed by using 2-way ANOVA/Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc test (α = 0.05). Results: For each prosthetic design, ZR presented the highest fracture resistance (p ≤ 0.005). Other than the differences with ZLS and RC for screw-cement crowns (p > 0.05) and RC for crowns on zirconia-titanium base abutments (p > 0.05), LGC showed the lowest fracture resistance. P endured higher loads than LDS (p < 0.001), except for the crowns on zirconia-titanium base abutments (p > 0.05). Cementable crowns presented the highest fracture resistance (p < 0.001), other than LGC and LDS. The differences between LGC crowns (p > 0.05) or LDS crowns on prefabricated titanium and zirconia-titanium abutments were nonsignificant (p = 0.133). Fragmented crown fracture was predominant in most of the restorations. Screw and abutment fractures were observed in ZR screw-cement crowns, and all P crowns were separated from the abutments. Conclusions: Restorative material and restoration design affect the fracture resistance and fracture pattern of implant-supported single-unit restorations. Clinicians may restore single-unit implants in premolar sites with the materials and prosthetic designs tested in the present study.",Journal of Prosthodontics,10.1016/j.prosdent.2020.11.002
Investigation DSC and XRD on the crystallization kinetics in the phosphate Li2O–Li2WO4–TiO2–P2O5 glassy ionic system,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Solid electrolytes-based lithium phosphates have achieved a great evolution due to the safety problem in the lithium-ion battery. This work targets to investigate the prepared glasses within the 20Li2O–(50 − x)Li2WO4–xTiO2–30P2O5 system, with 0 ≤ x ≤ 15 mol%. The bonds constituting the framework of these glasses were studied by Raman spectroscopy. The data analysis of the chemical durability showed that the dissolution rates depend on the composition of each glass. Thermal analysis by using the DSC technique was used to determine the activation energy of crystallization, it is found in the glassy composition (x = 5) that Ec= 184.482 kJ/mol. The determinate Avrami parameter is around 1.7, which allows suggesting the mechanism is surface crystallization. The crystallization process of the prepared glasses is carried out by heating samples at a suggested value of temperature around 550 °C for 4 and 12 h, with heating rate of 10 °C/min. The crystallized phases are identified by XRD. The results of the X-ray diffraction analysis confirm that TiO2 acts mainly as network forming units. The crystalline phases Li2WO4 and Li4P2O7 are formed during the crystallization process. The formation of these crystalline phases into the glasses depends on the time of heating at a fixed crystallization temperature. FTIR spectra of the glass–ceramics show nearly the same IR vibrational modes likewise their parent glasses.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,10.1016/j.prosdent.2020.09.035
Effect of CAD/CAM Bur Deterioration on the Surface Roughness of Ceramic Crowns,"© 2021 by the American College of Prosthodontists.Purpose: To evaluate the effect of repetitive milling on the surface roughness of ceramic crowns. Materials and Methods: Twenty feldspathic ceramic crowns (VITABLOCS Mark II; Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany) milled with hard milling protocol, and 20 zirconia crowns (5Y-TZP, inCoris TZI; Dentsply Sirona, York, PA) milled with soft milling protocol, using a 5-axis milling machine (inLab MC X5; Dentsply Sirona) were investigated. Atomic force microscopy (SPM SmartSPM™-1000) was used for surface roughness measurements (Ra, RMS). Pearson correlation between bur deterioration percentage as provided by the software of the milling machine and surface roughness was performed with an (r) range between 1 and –1. Trend analysis between the 2-half and among the 4-quarter bur lifetime was performed with linear contrast analysis and partial eta squared (η) for estimate of effect size. Analysis of mean variance between the zirconia and feldspathic ceramic groups was performed with a t-test, with α = 0.05. Results: Correlation analysis showed small correlation for Ra, RMS (r = –0.02, –0.16 for the feldspathic ceramic crowns and r = 0.044, 0.034 for the zirconia crowns), and no significant differences for the 2-half and 4-quarter groups (p > 0.05) for both crown types. Estimate of effect size was rated as medium for the 2-half groups (Ra = 0.420, RMS = 0.395) and large for the 4-quarter groups (RA = 0.22, F = 1.48, RMS = 0.19, F = 1.26) for the feldspathic ceramic crowns, and small effect size for the 2-half groups (Ra = 0.18, RMS = 0.20) and the 4-quarter groups (Ra = 0.035, RMS = 0.037) for the zirconia crowns. There was no significant difference (p = 0.178, F = 0.016. p = 0.088, F = 0.002) between the feldspathic ceramic and zirconia crowns with medium and large effect size (0.45, 0.57) for RA and RMS. Conclusions: Milling zirconia and feldspathic ceramic crowns had small correlation between bur deterioration and surface roughness when the burs were used within their recommended lifetime. However, hard milled feldspathic ceramic crowns had higher surface roughness than the soft milled zirconia crowns. Bur deterioration had a larger effect on the surface roughness of the feldspathic ceramic crowns than the zirconia crowns.",Journal of Prosthodontics,10.1016/j.prosdent.2020.08.047
Fatigue resistance of composite resins and glass-ceramics on dentin and enamel,"© 2020 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Composite resins and glass-ceramics are both used to restore worn teeth. Which restoration material is more durable is unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the load to failure of thin composite resins and glass-ceramic restorations on enamel and dentin under increasing repetitive loads. Material and methods: Glass-ceramic blocks (IPS e.max CAD; Ivoclar AG) were shaped into cylinders (Ø4.0×1.0 mm), crystallized, and adhesively luted to bovine dentin and enamel substrates that were embedded in polymethyl methacrylate (n=20). Identical direct composite resin restorations (Clearfil AP-X; Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc) were made and directly applied on the same substrates (n=20). All specimens were tested in a pneumatic device with a stainless steel ball that provided a stepwise increase of the load (N) starting at 250 N and increasing by 50 N after every 10 000 cycles to a maximum of 1150 N. Failures were detected by a displacement sensor and defined by chipping of restorative material or catastrophic failure. Results: On dentin, composite resin showed a significantly higher fatigue resistance than glass-ceramic. On enamel, no significant difference was found between the 2 materials. Conclusions: When bonded to dentin, thin direct composite resin restorations were more durable than glass-ceramics. When bonded to enamel, no difference was found.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1088/1742-6596/2230/1/012023
Effect of CAD-CAM tool deterioration on the trueness of ceramic restorations,"© 2020 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Tools will gradually deteriorate with repetitive milling. However, tool lifetime can vary depending on the type of milling machine, the hardness of the ceramic material, and the size of the restoration. Studies evaluating the effect of tool deterioration on the trueness of milled restorations are lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of tool deterioration on the trueness of milled restorations. Material and methods: A patient requiring a ceramic crown was recruited. Repetitive milling of zirconia crowns (inCoris TZI; Dentsply Sirona) with tungsten carbide rotary instruments and glass-ceramic crowns (VITABLOCS mark II; Vita Zahnfabrik) with diamond rotary instruments was performed by using a 5-axis milling machine (inLab MC X5; Dentsply Sirona) until the machine software program indicated replacing the largest tool. The percentage of deterioration for the largest tool was recorded before each milling. The trueness for different crown areas was evaluated by using a 3-dimensional evaluation software program (Geomagic Control X; 3D systems), and the crowns were clinically evaluated. The crowns were grouped into 4 quadrants as per the deterioration percentage. The Pearson correlation (r) between the deterioration percentage and trueness and linear contrast analysis (partial eta squared [η]) among the groups were performed. Results: Glass-ceramic crown areas had low correlation except for mesial (high, r=0.63, high, η=0.37) and distal (medium, r=0.42, high, η= 0.34) areas, whereas zirconia crowns had low correlation for inner and internal areas and medium to high correlation for mesial (r= -0.31, η=0.33), distal (r= -0.53, η=0.36), occlusal (r= -0.32, η=0.164), external (r= 0.69, η=0.52), and marginal (r= -0.44, η=0.19) areas. Zirconia crowns had excellent marginal fit and occlusal contact and light to excellent proximal contact, whereas glass-ceramic crowns had excellent marginal fit, minor to major occlusal correction, and heavy proximal contact. Conclusions: The effect of tool deterioration on trueness depended on material type and crown area. Only proximal areas were affected in the glass-ceramic crowns, whereas external, proximal, occlusal, and marginal areas were affected in the zirconia crowns. Trueness did not necessarily reflect the clinical quality of the crown, as both crown types were clinically satisfactory. Although zirconia crowns were overmilled in comparison with the reference design and glass-ceramic crowns, they had better clinical quality.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1088/1742-6596/2218/1/012082
Effect of screw access channel on the fracture rate of lithium disilicate cement-retained implant-supported posterior crowns,"© 2020 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Whether the presence of a screw access channel on the occlusal surface of a lithium disilicate cement-retained single tooth implant restoration reduces its fracture rate is unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to compare the fracture rate of lithium disilicate cement-retained posterior single tooth implant restorations with or without screw access channels. The study also evaluated whether the crown dimensions and location of the occlusal screw access channel would affect the fracture rate. Material and methods: A split-mouth study was conducted where 40 participants having 2 implants placed to restore single missing posterior teeth with crowns were enrolled. Implants were randomly allocated into a conventional crown group or a screw access group, receiving cement-retained restorations fabricated from lithium disilicate glass-ceramic with and without an occlusal screw access channel. Crown dimensions were recorded in millimeters from the designing software program. Follow-up evaluations were made at 3, 6, and 12 months by observing visible cracks or fractures of the crowns. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality was used. Comparisons were carried out by using the Student and Welch t tests (α=.05). Results: After a 12-month follow-up period, no crowns fractured or revealed visible cracks, resulting in a 100% success rate. No statistically significant differences were found between the conventional crown group and screw access channel group in all crown dimensions (P>.05). Conclusions: The presence of an occlusal screw access channel did not affect the short-term fracture rate of lithium disilicate cement-retained single implant–supported posterior crowns. The amount of axial cantilever, occlusal ceramic thickness, and location of the screw access channel on the occlusal surface of the restoration have no effect on its fracture rate.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.19912/j.0254-0096.tynxb.2020-0562

Scratch Behavior of Materials under Progressive Load by Conical Indenter 圆锥压头递增载荷对材料的划痕行为,"© 2022, Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Materials Research. All right reserved.The scratch characteristics in micron scale on 16 kinds of materials (2 kinds of glasses, 2 kinds of polymers, 4 kinds of ceramics, 4 kinds of metals and 4 kinds of metallic glasses) were assessed by means of Rockwell C diamond indentation with progressive load. The results show that these materials all have the maximum scratch retention rate (the ratio of residual indentation depth to indentation depth) related to elastic recovery, which can be used as the transition point of the apparent friction coefficient curve. The apparent friction coefficient of scratches is composed of adhesive friction coefficient and furrow friction coefficient. The three-dimensional mechanical contact model can be used to accurately characterize the friction coefficient except for metallic glass. The initial friction coefficient of the material is related to the Poisson's ratio. Polymeric materials (PC and PMMA) have special double scratch grooves due to stacking and sinking effects. The ratio of the hardness of scratched materials to the indentation hardness for 16 kinds of materials is 0.33~2.5, and there is a linear relationship between the scratch hardness and the volume modulus. The linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) model and microscopic energy size effect (MESEL) model were used to calculate the fracture toughness of the material. The results show that: LEFM model, Akono's MESEL model and Hubler's MESEL model can accurately characterize the fracture toughness of materials with low fracture toughness (glasses, ceramics and polymers), while the deviation of calculation results for metal materials with high fracture toughness is large. Liu's MESEL model can be used to characterize the fracture toughness of materials with large fracture toughness (metallic materials and some metallic glasses). The fracture toughness of the material has a piecewise linear correlation with Poisson's ratio.",Cailiao Yanjiu Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Materials Research,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.162747

Ultrafast Nanocrystallization of BaF2in Oxyfluoride Glasses with Crystal-like Nanostructures: Implications for Upconversion Fiber Devices,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Transparent glass-ceramic fibers containing fluoride nanocrystals are attracting attention as upconversion devices. In this paper, a material design is proposed that eliminates the need for heat treatment processes. The impact of short- to medium-range structures on the crystallization of glasses was investigated to enable nanocrystallization in the quenching process via ultrafast nucleation. In this study, the short- to medium-range structures of (33.3 - x/3)BaF2-xZnO-(66.7 - 2x/3)B2O3glasses were investigated by 11B- and 19F-magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and the high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction. After heat treatment, glasses with x > 40 formed BaF2nanocrystals with a diameter of ∼5 nm and a small particle size distribution (<1 nm). Based on the high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction, the critical size of the nuclei was estimated to be 4 nm, which was similar to the size of the precipitated crystals. Obvious selectivity in the binding was observed: F-preferred Ba2+and O2-preferred B3+, whereas Zn2+was bound to both anions. The binding selectivity caused a bicontinuous structure of oxide and fluoride domains, and the fluoride-related structure factors and bond distance were very similar to the peak positions of the precipitated crystals. Er3+-doped glasses with x > 40 showed upconversion luminescence with a spectrum similar to that of BaF2. These results suggested the pre-existence of a crystal-like structure with a composition, density, and ordering similar to those of the precipitated crystals. Moreover, glass with the modified composition was successfully crystallized during press-quenching of the melt and the fiber drawing process. These results could facilitate the production of photonic components such as nanocrystallized glass fibers and microspheres for upconversion lasers as well as a wide variety of glass-ceramic products.",ACS Applied Nano Materials,10.1088/1742-6596/2213/1/012009
Carbon nanotube@Mn3O4 composite as cathode for high-performance aqueous zinc ion battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Mn3O4 is viewed as an attractive candidate for rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion battery cathode materials due to the advantages of low cost, eco-friendly nature as well as high capacity. However, it faces inherently poor electronic conductivity and poor cyclability during battery cycling. To improve the electrochemical performance, Mn3O4 nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanotubes (CNTs@Mn3O4) were fabricated by a facile one-step solution process at low temperature. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of nanoscale Mn3O4 and 1D CNTs, the conductivity and electrochemical performance of Mn3O4 are significantly improved.

3D Printing-Enabled In-Situ Orientation of BaTi2O5Nanorods in β-PVDF for High-Efficiency Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) with a three-dimensional (3D) structure are arousing increasing interest because of the ability to efficiently convert mechanical energy into electricity catering for self-powered systems. Among them, 3D PEHs composed of 1-3-type piezoelectric composites which exploit one-dimensional (1D) piezoceramic fillers rather than conventional powders are particularly attractive. However, an issue involving the orientation of the 1D fillers to utilize the piezoelectric effect renders the 3D structural design for high-efficiency energy conversion more challenging. Herein, for the first time, we introduce the fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing to the flexible construction of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based 3D PEHs by incorporating 1D BaTi2O5 (BT2) nanorods as piezoelectric fillers. The shearing force generated by FDM successfully realizes the in situ uniform orientation of BT2 nanorods in the PVDF (98% β crystals) matrix along the nozzle extrusion direction. Besides, by coupling 3D printing with the appealing piezoelectric anisotropy feature of BT2 nanorods, the 3D PEH is able to generate different piezoelectric responses to the same applied external force from X, Y, and Z directions. Furthermore, an optimized 3D conical array structure is constructed to amplify the effective deformation of the PEH to enhance its piezoelectric output. As expected, customized PEH can continuously power commercial electronic devices and monitor various human motions, indicating 3D printing as a multifunctional strategy to fabricate 3D PEHs with 1-3-type piezoelectric composite materials for self-powering microelectronic applications.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2022.125799
"Effect of Borax On Sintering Kinetics, Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Porous Glass-Ceramics From Coal Fly Ash by Direct Overfiring","Copyright © 2022 Zeng, Sun and Peng.The direct sintering process of coal fly ash for the preparation of glass-ceramics is the liquid-phase sintering process, from non-densification to densification. When the temperature exceeds the densification temperature point, the porosity of glass-ceramics on the contrary increases and the pore diameter increases. This provides a basis to prepare porous glass-ceramics by direct overfiring. Adding borax to coal fly ash can reduce the temperature of liquid phase formation, reduce the preparing temperature of porous glass-ceramics, achieve the purpose of energy saving. The effects of borax on the structure, properties and sintering kinetics of porous glass-ceramics prepared from coal fly ash by overfiring were investigated. It is found that the introduction of B-O bond can change the network structure of non-crystalline vitreous in coal fly ash, reduce the melting temperature, promote the formation of liquid phase, and thus increase the porosity of porous glass-ceramics. This paper provides a certain experimental basis for the preparation of porous glass-ceramics by direct overfiring of coal fly ash at low temperature without adding pore-forming agent, and provides a new possibility for the high-value resource utilization of coal fly ash.",Frontiers in Chemistry,10.1016/j.compstruct.2021.115132
Mineral composite materials and their energy storage and energy catalysis applications 矿物复合材料及其能量存储与能源催化应用,"© 2022, Science Press. All right reserved.Mineral composite material is a cross-field of mineralogy and composite material that has emerged in recent years. These materials have specific functional properties of minerals and the unique characteristics of composite materials. Energy-related materials are currently a research hotspot. However, a systematic review of energy storage and energy catalysis in composite materials from natural minerals is few. Mineral composite materials have the following advantages. (1) Minerals are natural composite materials conducive to ecological civilization construction. (2) Mineral resources are abundant on the Earth, which means pronounced cost reduction in composite materials. (3) Mineral-derived tailings wastes can be comprehensively turned into treasure. This study presents the advances in energy storage and catalysis applications of composite materials from a mineral composite perspective. First, we discussed this discipline's evolution, the development process, and classified mineral composite materials. Second, we introduced the applications of mineral composites in the field of energy storage, such as piezoelectric self-power generation, supercapacitors, and secondary batteries. Finally, we summarized the applications of mineral composites in the domain of energy catalysis, including electrocatalysis, energy photocatalysis, and pyroelectric/piezoelectric catalysis. The regulation of mineral functions or auxiliary units can significantly improve energy storage and catalytic activities. Specifically, the mineral loading/recombination strategy for photocatalytic applications helps inhibit the recombination of photo-generated carriers and enhance their light absorption. Stripping the mineral ore and forming a composite material for energy electrocatalysis are beneficial in exposing its active catalytic sites and reducing the activation energy required for hydrogen evolution reaction applications. Mineral composite materials have evolved from mechanical functional mineral composite materials to multi-functional mineral composite materials. However, numerous problems remain on the path to scientific research and industrialization, such as batch preparation and mineral composites' stability. We conclude that strengthening the practical design of multi-functional mineral composites enables us to understand the mechanism of mineral composite materials by combing crystal structure design, physical and chemical characterizations, and theoretical calculation/simulation. Further, we presented future scientific challenges and development opportunities for mineral composite materials.",Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.121386
Multiwalled carbon nanotubes coated with twin-strengthened copper,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.This work reports a facile method to fabricate copper-coated CNTs containing lamellar twins that deliver improved mechanical properties. The coating process is carried out via a wet chemical reduction method with molecular level mixing technique. Detailed optimization experiments reveal the effect of the reduction speed of the precursor on the morphology of the copper-based nanostructures and their efficacy in achieving uniform coating on the CNTs. The origin of the different nanostructures is studied via crystallographic simulation and supported by the LaMer mechanism. The prepared nanocomposites exhibit improved mechanical properties compared to pure Cu as well as other Cu-CNT based materials reported in the literature. The dependence of mechanical properties on the particle morphology of the precursor nanostructures is also examined. This improvement is due to the strong interfacial bonding between Cu and CNTs and the presence of lamellar twins in Cu, as observed from TEM analysis. The measured elastic modulus values of the nanocomposites are in good agreement with the values predicted by Halpin-Tsai and Shear-lag models.",Materials Chemistry and Physics,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.121385
A review on stochastic multiscale analysis for FRP composite structures,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdFibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites have been increasingly applied in engineering structures especially for achieving high demands on structural performance, but they are susceptible to variations in material properties, geometry parameters, etc. mainly arising from manufacturing processes. Due to these uncertainties, FRP structures are usually adopted conservative designs. In order to fully explore the merits of FRP composites, it is therefore of paramount importance to understand and quantify uncertainties in FRP composite structures. Although there are mainly studies on uncertainty quantification for FRP structures, there is a lack of a systematic review. The present study intends to provide a comprehensive review on multiscale uncertainty quantification techniques from the following three aspects: (1) the source of uncertainty: uncertainties induced by manufacturing defects are presented and their influences on the mechanical properties of composite materials are analysed; (2) the prediction of the effective material properties with uncertainties: probabilistic homogenization methods used to propagate uncertainties from microscale to macroscale are described, and influences of microscale uncertainties on the effective material properties are discussed; (3) the probabilistic structural analysis: methods for static analysis, dynamic analysis, buckling stability analysis and reliability analysis with considerations of multiscale uncertainties are presented.",Composite Structures,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.131498
Eu-doped BaO-Al2O3-SiO2−MgF2 glass and glass ceramics,"© 2021Transparent Eu2+-doped BaAl2Si2O8 glass-ceramics have been prepared by traditional glass melting method. The evolution of synthesized materials during thermal treatment in air atmosphere was studied by X-ray diffraction analysis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Thermal treatment of glass in air atmosphere leads to the formation of numerous crystal phases, the main of them is BaAl2Si2O8. Obtained glass-ceramics demonstrate strong blue emission (λmax = 420 nm) related to the 5d-4f7 transition of Eu2+ ions. Prepared transparent Eu2+-doped BaAl2Si2O8 glass ceramics can be considered as potential candidate for practical application in powerful white light-emitting diodes.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.131538
New high nickel-containing glass-ceramics based on Li2O–CaO–SiO2 eutectic (954 °C) system for magnetic applications,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In the present work, the authors partially introduce NiO in the place of CaO into the 23.5Li2O-11.5CaO-55SiO2 eutectic (954 ± 4 °C) glass system to study the effect of composition modification on crystallization characteristics and magnetic behavior. Also, the effects of NiO contents on density, microhardness and chemical durability were examined. Lithium-based silicate glasses were prepared by a conventional melt-quenching technique, followed by a two-step heat-treatment to prepare glass-ceramics. The DTA results indicated that Tg of the synthesised glasses decreased with the increase of NiO content. The XRD indicated that Li-disilicate and their solid solution (Li,Ni)2Si2O5, Li2Ca3Si6O16 and quartz phases were crystallized, in addition to Niopside-CaNiSi2O6 and Ni2SiO4 phases. Adding NiO instead of CaO in the prepared glass-ceramics led to the formation of a dense structure with density values rising from 2.48 to 2.62 g/cm3 and greatly improved in hardness number from 4410 to 5311 MPa. The chemical durability has also improved dramatically. The examined glass-ceramics had excellent magnetic properties with saturation magnetization (0.053 –0.44 emu/g), remanence magnetization (1.7–5.4 emu/g), and coercivity force (50–157 G).The study shows glass-ceramic with excellent properties that have attracted considerable attention in electronic devices, wear-resistance uses, and biomedicine applications.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.131557
EDTA-2Na assisted facile synthesis of monoclinic bismuth vanadate (m-BiVO4) and m-BiVO4/rGO as a highly efficient visible-light-driven photocatalyst,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.An efficient facile synthesis method for BiVO4/reduced graphene oxide (BiVO4/rGO) photocatalyst by a one-pot hydrothermal process was first developed. Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na) rather than nitrate was used to provide an acidic environment to prevent the hydrolysis of Bi3+, which could improve the safety of the process. The photocatalytic activities could be remarkably enhanced by loading BiVO4 on rGO. The degradation efficiency for Rhodamine B (rhB) could reach 98.3% in 180 min. This work offered an ideal method for stable, efficient, and recyclable photocatalysts suitable for the visible light range.",Materials Letters,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.12.060
Fabrication of novel flower-like Co3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction for tetracycline degradation under visible light irradiation,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In this paper, the flower-like Co3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction was successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method, and characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, UV–Vis DRS, PL and BET technologies. In Co3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction, the g-C3N4 presents a graphene-like nanosheet structure, and lts surfaces were deposited with flower-like Co3O4. DRS evidences that the light absorption of the Co3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction shifted to red. PL shows that the effective separation of charge carriers was significantly enhanced, which is due to the construction of P-N heterojunction. Moreover, using TC as a simulated pollutant, the asprepared Co3O4/g-C3N4-3% shows a excellent photocatalytic performance that the degradation rate of TC could reach to 85.32% after 120 min of visible light irradiation. This paper provides a new exemplification of constructing heterojunction microstructures for high-efficiency photocatalytic removing tetracycline pollutants.",Materials Letters,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.163164
Quasi-static compressive behavior of bioactive glass reinforced high density polyethylene composites,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Compressive behavior of additively manufactured bioactive glass (BAG) reinforced high density polyethylene (HDPE) composites under quasi static conditions (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 s−1 strain rates) is investigated in this work. HDPE feedstock filaments with 5, 10 and 20 wt% of bioactive glass are extruded for fused filament fabrication (FFF) based 3D printing (3DP). Compressive properties are extracted from the stress–strain plots. Elastic modulus and yield strength of the samples increase with filler addition and strain rate. Energy absorption increases with increase in strain rate and BAG content. All the samples exhibit homogeneous ductile deformation with distinct barrelling effect without any visible cracks.

Mid infrared fluorescence characteristics and application of Co2+:ZnS doped chalcogenide glass-ceramics,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.A Co2+:ZnS-doped chalcogenide glass with broadband mid-infrared emission was prepared by using a hot uniaxial pressing process. The refractive index difference (Δn) between matrix glass (As2S5) and crystal (Co2+:ZnS) was controlled to be 0.0042 in the emission spectral range of Co2+ to minimize the scattering effect. An ultrabroadband mid-infrared emission of 2–4 μm was observed at room temperature in the samples after excitation by using a commercially available laser diode of 1550 nm. The significant changes in the lifetime and fluorescence intensity of Co2+:ZnS-doped chalcogenide glass were measured in the temperature range of 90–290 K. A resolution of approximately 0.18 K was observed when used as a temperature detector. Furthermore, a gas-sensing device was built by using the strong and broad emissions of the sample, and the detection sensitivity of butane reached 56 ppm. These results show that this glass-ceramics can be used as optical sensing of gas and temperature.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.12.051
Luminescence and energy transfer of Dy3+-Eu3+ co-doped glass-ceramics containing ZnMoO4,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Dy3+-Eu3+ co-doped glass-ceramics (GCs) containing ZnMoO4 were successfully prepared. The temperature range of heat treatment was preliminarily determined by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG). The crystalline phase was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), the structural feature was analyzed on the basis of Rietveld refinement, the morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the absorption coefficients were calculated by light transmission curves. Combined with the above analysis, the optimal heat treatment condition was discussed. Through the fluorescence spectra and decay curve, there existed an energy transfer between Dy3+ and Eu3+, and the energy transfer efficiency from Dy3+ to Eu3+ increased with the increase of Eu3+ concentration. By calculating the critical distance and linearly fitting the data, it could be concluded that the mechanism of energy transfer was dipole-dipole interaction. With the changed of Dy3+-Eu3+ doped concentration, the color coordinates of these samples can be tuned in the white light region, and the 0.4% Dy3+-0.7% Eu3+ co-doped glass-ceramics obtained warm white light emission with low correlated color temperature (CCT). These results clearly showed that Dy3+-Eu3+ co-doped GCs containing ZnMoO4 could be used as a potential candidate material in the field of white light-emitting diodes (w-LEDs).",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.12.065
"Cerium oxide containing canasite based glass-ceramics for dental applications: Crystallization behavior, mechanical and chemical properties","© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The present work aims to investigate the role of CeO2 (cerium oxide) on crystallization behavior, microstructural features as well as mechanical and chemical properties of canasite glass-ceramics for dental applications. The obtained results confirm that further addition of cerium oxide to the glass composition leads to a slight increase of crystallization temperatures and significant decrease of thermal expansion coefficients of the starting glasses. According to the Raman spectroscopy results, cerium ions increase the network connectivity of the parent glasses by increasing the number of bridging oxygens. During the two step heat treatment, the presence of cerium oxide favors crystallization of miserite (K(Ca,Ce)5Si8O22[(OH)F]2) besides calcium fluoride (CaF2) and canasite (Ca5Na4K2Si12O30F4) crystalline phases. Based on the microstructural observations, canasite crystals have the inter-locked blade-like morphology whereas crystals of miserite have the cubic like morphology. Among the studied glass-ceramics, Base-C2 showed the highest value of chemical durability as well as acceptable mechanical properties fulfilling the essential requirements as a restorative dental material.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.11.315
Glass-forming ability and ZrO2 saturation limits in the magnesium aluminosilicate system,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Containerless melting was employed to evaluate the influence of increasing ZrO2 additions on the glass-forming ability of peraluminous melts in the magnesium aluminosilicate system. The saturation limit of this oxide in glasses along the silica-cordierite join (SiO2–Mg2Al4Si5O18) is inversely proportional to the SiO2 content; however, a limited solubility of ZrO2 in melt-quenched silica exists (∼2 mol%). Peraluminous samples (particularly MgO-free samples) exhibited a substantially higher capability of incorporating ZrO2 without undergoing devitrification during cooling. TEM investigations revealed phase separation in all amorphous samples off the MgO = Al2O3 line, with ZrO2 preferentially segregating into a SiO2-depleted phase. These results identify the key role of Al2O3 for the structural incorporation of ZrO2 in silicate melts, opening up alternative pathways for the development of glasses and glass-ceramics respectively based on the homogeneous distribution of ZrO2 or, in turn, on its exploitation to induce phase separation and crystal nucleation.",Ceramics International,10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c01416
Microgrinding of lithium metasilicate/disilicate glass-ceramics,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Lithium metasilicate and disilicate glass-ceramics (LMGC and LDGC) are attractive dental materials but poor surface quality produced in current milling/grinding is a technical bottleneck. This paper reports on the microgrinding characteristics and mechanisms of LMGC and LDGC using micro-pencil diamond tools at different conditions. Surface quality was assessed using 3D laser confocal microscopy in terms of comprehensive roughness parameters. A combination of brittle and localized ductile removal mixture and brittle fracture was featured on the microground LMCG and LDGC surfaces identified through microscopic examination. The generation of brittle and localized ductile areas significantly depended on the diamond grit size and the depth of cut, resulting in different surface asperities. Better surface quality was achieved with reduced diamond grit size and depth of cut. The nanoscale maximum grit cutting depth in microginding achieved the best average and maximum roughness values of 0.241 ± 0.009 μm and 4.380 ± 0.861 μm for LMGC with approximately 80% and 60% reductions in comparison with dental CAD/CAM milling, respectively. Microgrinding of LDGC also achieved the best average and maximum roughness values of 0.168 ± 0.013 μm and 3.693 ± 0.467 μm with more than 90% improvement compared with simulated conventional grinding, simplifying the manufacturing procedure for LDGC restorations. Microgrinding also produced the kurtosis and skewness for both materials comparable to human teeth. More diamond tool wear occurred in microgrinding of high-strength LDGC than low-strength LMGC. Although microgrinding of multiphase LMCG and LDGC in ductile regime can be challenging due to microstructural diversity, the technique can advance current CAD/CAM milling/grinding for high-quality shaping of high-strength ceramic restorations.",Ceramics International,10.1039/d1ce01292d
"Effect of ZnO on the structural, physio-mechanical properties and thermal shock resistance of Li2O–Al2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramics","© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The composition of lithium aluminosilicate (LAS) with different zinc oxide-magnesium oxide (ZnO–MgO) contents that ranged from 0 to 1.45 wt percent (wt%) was investigated to determine the thermal shock resistance properties of the glass-ceramics. The LAS glasses were melted in an alumina crucible at 1550 °C for 5 h, and the green compact samples were then heat-treated at 1100 °C for 3.5 h. The presence of zinc oxide (ZnO) in the compositions did not change the major crystal phase of β-spodumene. However, the addition of ZnO shifted the pronounced peak to a lower angle and increased the percentage of crystallinity from 55% to 59%. Additionally, the function of ZnO in LAS glass-ceramics as the network modifier was confirmed through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The physio-mechanical properties were improved when 1.45 wt% ZnO was added to the LAS glass-ceramics. The results showed increased density (2.42 g/cm3), low porosity (0.85%), high flexural strength (125.23 MPa), and low coefficient of thermal expansion (25–800 °C) (CTE(25–800 °C)) value of 1.73 × 10−6 °C−1. Meanwhile, the thermal shock resistance properties evaluation of the LAS glass-ceramics at different ZnO contents were conducted at different thermal shock temperatures of 200 °C, 500 °C, and 800 °C. The critical temperature of the LAS specimens with 1.45 wt% ZnO demonstrated the ability to withstand a thermal shock at 800 °C while preserving 87% of their initial strength of 108.40 MPa, exemplifying the best LAS glass-ceramics properties for rapid high-temperature change applications.",Ceramics International,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c09456
"Promises of Functionally Graded Material in Bone Regeneration: Current Trends, Properties, and Challenges","© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Functionally graded materials (FGMs) are emerging materials systems, with structures and compositions gradually changing in a particular direction. Consequently, the properties of the materials gradually change in the desired direction to achieve particular nonhomogeneous service demands without abrupting the compositional and behavioral interface at the macroscale. FGMs have been found to have high potential as orthopedic implants; because the functional gradient can be adapted in such a manner that the core of FGM should be compatible with the density and strength of bone, interlayers can maintain the structural integrity and outermost layers would provide bioactivity and corrosion resistance, thus overall tailoring the stress shielding effect. This review article discusses the typical FGM systems existing in nature and the human body, focusing on bone tissue. Further, the reason behind the application of these FGMs systems in orthopedic implants is explored in detail, considering the physical and biological necessities. The substantial focus of the present critical review is devoted to two primary topics related to the usage of FGMs for orthopedic implants: (1) the synthesizing techniques currently available to produce FGMs for load-bearing orthopedic applications and (2) the properties, such as mechanical, structural, and biological behavior of the FGMs. This review article gives an insight into the potential of FGMs for orthopedic applications.",ACS Biomaterials Science and Engineering,10.1039/d1cp03492h

Correlation between Structural Features and Ionic Transport in Lithium-Ion Conducting Glass-Ceramics from the Li1+xCrxGeTi1-x(PO4)3 System,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.NASICON-structured glass-ceramics based on the Li1+xCrxGeTi1-x (PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) system are synthesized by the melt-quenching method followed by glass crystallization. Since Ti4+ and Cr3+ have approximately the same crystal radius in octahedral coordination, this aliovalent substitution should avoid considerable changes in the cell volume, thus allowing us to evaluate the true contribution of the substitution of a tetravalent cation by a trivalent one on other structural factors. The crystal structure of these glass-ceramics is investigated by X-ray and high-resolution neutron diffraction while the electrical properties are accessed by impedance spectroscopy. Fourier differences and bond valence energy landscape analyses are used to determine the additional Li position and occupancies caused by the aliovalent substitution of Ti4+ by Cr3+. The most important change in the structural features caused by the increase in the lithium content in the chemical formula is the occupation of the 36f position followed by the partial depopulation of the 6b sites. Furthermore, the grain-related ionic conductivity and activation energy for lithium conduction are notably dependent on the aliovalent substitution. The correlations between these two main findings are discussed herein.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.15541/jim20210518
Effects of vacancy defects on the interfacial thermal resistance of partially overlapped bilayer graphene,"© the Owner Societies.Graphene has been extensively applied in composite materials due to its high thermal conductivity. Multi-layered graphene has great potential in the construction of a continuous filler network but is restricted by the high interfacial thermal resistance between adjacent graphene layers. This paper investigates the effects of the overlapping area and interlayer sp3 bonding of partially overlapped bilayer graphene on the interfacial thermal resistance using molecular dynamic simulations. The results show the linear relationship between the interfacial thermal resistance and the overlapping area. Then, identical vacancy defects of the same plane coordinates were added to each of the two graphene sheets, and it was found that the presence of an armchair edge restricted the formation of interface sp3 bonding to some extent, while the zigzag edge did not. However, their similar bond length and the phonon density of state of bonded atoms in the models with different edges indicated their similar effects on the heat transfer. Therefore, the thermal resistance of all single sp3 bonds in different models could be approximated to 14.3 × 10-9 m2 KW-1. A formula is proposed to describe the inverse relationship between the number of sp3 bonds and the interfacial thermal resistance. Finally, the vacancy defect on the upper graphene sheet was moved to stagger the two vacancies. The length of sp3 bonds was changed slightly due to the staggered arrangement, and the interfacial thermal resistance was found to be positively correlated with the bond length. This allows valuable interfacial heat-transfer properties of the partially overlapped bilayer graphene to contribute to the thermal management of the 3D filler network.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.2341/20-156-L
A Sprayable and Visible Light Rapid-Cured Strippable Film for Surface Radioactive Decontamination,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Strippable film is effective for removing radioactive contamination. However, it still has some limitations, such as the long curing time (about 30 min~24 h) and the requirement of organic solvents. To address these issues, we report a simple protocol to prepare strippable decontamination films using liquid polybutadiene (LPB) and tert-butyl acrylate (TBA) as the raw materials without solvent and using camphorquinone/ethyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate (CQ/EDB) as a photoinitiator, where the film was formed under household LED panel light or daylight irradiation for about 540 s. After a thorough study of viscosity, real-time Fourier transform infrared (RT-FTIR spectra), gel and volatile organic compound (VOC) contents, mechanical properties and decontamination efficiency, the optimum composition and curing conditions were determined for the decontamination strippable film. VOC content is as low as 12.7 ± 0.7% and the resultant strippable film exhibits good mechanical performances with a tensile strength of up to 5.4 ± 0.4 MPa and elongation of up to 66.6 ± 13%. Most important, the decontamination efficiencies of this strippable film for133 CsCl on glass, ceramic and metal surfaces reach up to 98.1%, 94.3% and 97.6%, respectively.",Polymers,10.2341/20-176-L
Photo Curing and Pressureless Sintering of Orange-emitting Glass-ceramics 橙黄光玻璃陶瓷的光固化成型与无压烧结,"© 2022, Science Press. All right reserved.Because of low thermal conductivity and weak physical and chemical stabilities, traditional ""phosphor in silicone"" color converters are precluded from high-power white LED applications. All-inorganic bulk luminescence materials not only can circumvent organic encapsulation, but also have higher thermal conductivity. However, those bulk materials are high in cost and very difficult to be shaped into three-dimensional structures. Here, based on amorphous silica nanoparticles, a slurry, containing(Gd, Y)AG:Ce phosphor powders and can be polymerized under UV light, were developed. Bulk (Gd, Y)AG:Ce-silica glass composites were prepared successfully through photo curing, debinding in air and pressureless sintering. Under excitation of blue light, these luminescence glass-ceramics exhibit broadband orange emission peaking at 575 nm with internal quantum efficiency higher than 90%. Our results show that the interfacial reaction between (Gd, Y)AG:Ce and silica glass is very weak, and thus the former can be well embedded into bulk silica glass. Such all-inorganic color converters were further used to fabricate high-power warm white LEDs with correlated color temperature smaller than 4500 K, color rendering index higher than 75, and luminous efficiency of 74 lm•W-1. Luminescence saturation threshold of the as-fabricated laser lighting device is as high as 2.84 W•mm-2, where its luminous flux can achieve 180 lm. Moreover, preparation of (Gd, Y)AG:Ce-silica glass compositesis compatible to 3D printing technology, thus allowing the mass manufacturing of color converters with complex 3D structures, which may promote personalization and modularization of high-power white LEDs.",Wuji Cailiao Xuebao/Journal of Inorganic Materials,10.1007/s11204-022-09787-7
Surface Treatment and Cementation of Lithium Silicate Ceramics Containing ZrO2,"©Operative Dentistry, 2022.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of different surface treatments on the shear bond strength (SBS) of lithium silicate (LS) and lithium disilicate (LD) ceramics, after thermocycling. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For SBS test, 72 ceramic blocks (18×14×2 mm) were made (24 blocks from each ceramic material): VITA Suprinity (LSS), Celtra Duo (LSC), and Lithium disilicate (LD). The blocks were polished with sandpaper of increasing grit (#280, #400, #800, and #1200) and embedded in chemically activated acrylic resin. Afterwards, they were randomly divided into 12 groups (6 blocks per group) according to: ""Ceramic"" (LD, LSC, and LSS) and ""Surface treatment"" (HFS: hydrofluoric acid + silane; MEP: Monobond Etch & Prime/Ivoclar). From each treated surface ceramic block, four dual-curing resin cement cylinders (RelyX U200, 3M Oral Care) were prepared using a Tygon tube (Ø=3 mm and h=2 mm) and light cured for 40 seconds (1000 mW/cm2) (N=288/n=24). All specimens were submitted to thermocycling (10,000 cycles, 5°C and 55°C, 30 seconds) and then to SBS test at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min using a 50-kgf load cell. Forty-five additional blocks were made for roughness and SEM analysis. Failure mode was also performed. The data (MPa) were statistically analyzed by oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey test (5%), and Weibull analysis. The Ra was analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn Test (5%). The other variables were analyzed qualitatively. RESULTS: ANOVA revealed that ""surface treatment"" was significant for all ceramic materials (p<0.05). The LD-HFS (18.66±3.49), LSC-HFS (16.81±2.62), and LSS-HFS (16.33±3.08) groups had significantly higher SBS than the LD-MEP (7.00±4.2), LSCMEP (14.12±3.51), and LSS-MEP (13.87±2.52) groups. Complete adhesive failures at the cement-dentin interface were more frequent. Weibull modulus was superior for the LD-HFS (6.22), LSC-HFS (8.8), and LSS-HFS (7.4) groups. CONCLUSION: HF followed by silanization is the most suitable surface treatment for the cementation of LS and LD glass ceramics.",Operative dentistry,10.1007/s10553-022-01363-x
Evaluation of Cleaning Methods on Lithium Disilicate Glass Ceramic Surfaces After Organic Contamination,"©Operative Dentistry, 2022.The purposes of this study were to 1) evaluate the effectiveness of different cleaning methods from a previously etched and silanized lithium disilicate glass ceramic (EMX) surface after contact with organic fluids (saliva or human blood) and 2) assess the effect of applying a new silane layer after the cleaning methods on the microshear bond strength (mSBS) of resin cement to EMX. EMX discs were etched with 5% hydrofluoric acid (HF) and properly silanized. Three control groups were created (n=10): control (without contamination), saliva positive, and human blood positive. Later, after new contaminations, the samples were distributed into four groups according to the cleaning method (n=20): air-water spray (AWS), 35% phosphoric acid, 70% alcohol, or Ivoclean cleaning paste. After the cleaning methods, subgroups were submitted to a new silane layer application, or not (n=10). All samples received a thin layer of a bonding agent and, subsequently, three light-cured resin cement cylinders were prepared on each EMX surface for the mSBS test. This test was performed on a universal testing machine at a vertical speed of 1 mm/minute until rupture. Contaminated and cleaned silanized EMX surfaces were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (n=1). The noncontaminated control group showed an average mSBS of 18.7 MPa, and the positive saliva and human blood control groups yielded a 34% and 42% reduction in bond strength, respectively, compared to the uncontaminated control (p<0.05). For saliva-contaminated surfaces, all cleaning methods were effective and not different from one another or the control group (p>0.05). However, for human blood contamination, only Ivoclean cleaning paste was effective in restoring μSBS to uncontaminated control group levels (p>0.05). SEM images showed a clean surface (ie, with no contaminant residues) after the cleaning methods, regardless of the organic contaminant type.

Research Progress on Preparation of Metal-Based Graphene Composites by Laser Additive Manufacturing Technology 激光增材技术制备金属基石墨烯复合材料研究进展,"© 2022, Science Press. All right reserved.Additive manufacturing technology (3D printing) is an important development direction of advanced manufacturing technology, which has been applied to aerospace, automotive industry, biomedicine and other important fields. Since the first exfoliation of single-layer graphene in 2004, graphene and other two-dimensional crystal materials have gradually become a research hotspot in the field of composite materials. Its excellent mechanical properties and conductivity make it more suitable for reinforced phase materials. By adjusting the content and distribution of graphene reinforcement phase, the mechanical strength, conductivity and other properties of metal matrix materials can be greatly improved, and excellent structure function integrated materials can be obtained. Laser additive manufacturing technology combined with the advantages of high specific surface area and anisotropy of graphene nanosheets, further processing and mixing of graphene and metal powder, and then layer by layer printing to construct 3D structure, has become a new research direction, which is leading the progress of the fourth generation of industrial revolution. Based on laser additive manufacturing technology, metal based matrix graphene composites prepared by laser additive manufacturing technology were summarized from three aspects, that is, graphene based aluminum, nickel and other metal matrix composites prepared by laser additive manufacturing technology. The forming process and material properties were compared, and the possible development direction in the future was analyzed.",Xiyou Jinshu Cailiao Yu Gongcheng/Rare Metal Materials and Engineering,10.1515/mt-2021-2038

All right reserved.The 0-3 type Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-CoFe2O4 (NBT-CFO) composite multiferroic ceramics with embedded structures were prepared by in-situ sol-gel method, and their electrical and magnetic properties were studied. The crystallization behavior was studied by TG-DTA and XRD. Based on the difference between the crystallization temperatures of CFO and NBT, a two-step calcination process was designed to obtain NBT-CFO nano-powders with the average size of 45 nm. 0.9NBT-0.1CFO (0.1CFO-SG) composite ceramics sintered using the nano-powders have embedded structures, where the CFO grains are uniformly distributed inside the NBT grains. Compared to the composite ceramics prepared by the mechanical mixing method, the 0.1CFO-SG composite ceramics with embedded structures have lower dielectric loss in 250 Hz~1 MHz at room temperature, and the loss at 250 Hz is only 30% of the former. The temperature dependent relative permittivities, impedance spectrum and mode spectrum show that composite ceramics with embedded structures exhibit dielectric relaxation behavior caused by the interfacial polarization between NBT and CFO at 350~650 °C, and the activation energy is 0.77 eV. 0.1CFO-SG composite ceramics with embedded structures have larger remanent polarization, higher breakdown strength and greater ferroelectric performances at room temperature.",Xiyou Jinshu Cailiao Yu Gongcheng/Rare Metal Materials and Engineering,10.1007/s10853-022-07054-6
Development and Performance of Urea–Formaldehyde Resin/Montmorillonite Intercalation Composite Horizontal well Plugging Agent,"© 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Accurate identification of the water outlet point after a horizontal well has produced water is difficult, resulting in difficulty in blocking water. This article proposes improved water plugging technology for general plugging of the wellbore. In this technology, the organic polymer UF and the inorganic rigid reinforced particle MMT are combined to obtain composite at the nanometer scale for a horizontal well plugging. FIRT, XRD, TG-DSC, SEM, and other methods are used to characterize the structure of intercalated composite materials. The results show the successful MMT modification and pre-polymer synthesis reaction. The performance of the composite plugging agent is evaluated by a rotating rheometer, mechanical experiment, and plugging experiment. The initial viscosity of the plugging agent in a rheological test is 28.81 mPa·s, which shows that the plugging agent has good injectability and is not affected by shear. The solidified strength of the plugging agent material is 11.45 MPa, which meets the plugging requirements. In the core physical simulation experiment, the breakthrough pressure gradient reaches 86 MPa/m, indicating that the plugging strength of the plugging agent is high, the plugging rate is still more than 90% after 40 hours of water scouring, and the erosion resistance is strong. Compared with other plugging agents, UF-OMMT plugging agent has better thermal stability. Hence, the developed plugging agent has good application prospects.",Chemistry and Technology of Fuels and Oils,10.1088/2631-6331/ac4de9
Solar power harvesting with metal modified windshield glass to obtain hot water,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Energy solar harvesting through low environmental impact resources is an underlying objective for future technological developments.

Effect of particles on tensile and bending properties of jute epoxy composites,"© 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.In this investigation, mechanical properties of composite materials produced from woven jute type were investigated. These composites were produced in the form of epoxy adhesive layers by using hand lay-up method in which aluminum, mica and ceramic particles were added into epoxy as a structural adhesive by 2, 4 and 6 wt%. Samples produced according to ASTM D procedures were subjected to tensile and three point bending loads to examine the effect of the particles. Experimental results were presented in tables and graphs. As a result, it was observed that the tensile and bending failure loads of the composite materials obtained by using the particle reinforced adhesive increased. Also, the biggest rise in tensile strength was achieved with 4 wt% aluminum and the biggest increase in bending strength was observed for 2 wt% aluminum particles.",Materialpruefung/Materials Testing,10.3390/min12030360
"Noble metals Pt, Au, and Ag as nucleating agents in BaO/SrO/ZnO/SiO2 glasses: formation of alloys and core–shell structures","© 2022, The Author(s).Noble metals such as Ag can be used as nucleation agents in glass ceramics. In glasses, it is incorporated predominantly as AgI. At temperatures slightly above the glass transition temperature, Tg, AgI reacts with SbIII to SbV and metallic Ag. Usually, face-centered cubic Ag particles are nearly spherical and get facetted during crystal growth. By contrast, in the case of BaO/SrO/ZnO/SiO2 glasses, silver has, in comparison to other noble metals, another significant, yet different effect. It forms metallic particles (hexagonal phase) with plate-like morphology during thermal treatment at 675 °C. In the second step of thermal treatment at 760 °C, this phase most probably expels some metallic Sb, which is oxidized by SbV (present in the surrounding glass phase) to SbIII. As a result, the plate-like morphology is maintained and a crystalline shell around the metallic core is formed, mainly consisting of ZnO with some SiO2 and antimony oxide, as proved by scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. This shell triggers the volume crystallization of Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn2Si2O7, a phase with low thermal expansion. By comparison, alloying of Au with Sb does not occur according to the phase diagram. Instead, a thermal treatment at temperatures slightly above Tg leads to nanocrystalline, spherical Au particles. Hence, alloying and subsequent decomposition of the alloy is a prerequisite for the formation of plate-like noble metal particles.",Journal of Materials Science,10.3390/polym14051001

"Increasing Acid Concentration, Time and Using a Two-Part Silane Potentiates Bond Strength of Lithium Disilicate– Reinforced Glass Ceramic to Resin Composite: An Exploratory Laboratory Study","© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.There is still a lack of consensus concerning the recommended etching concentration, application time and type of silane when bonding lithium disilicate-reinforced glass ceramics man-ufactured by CAD/CAM. The purpose of this study was thus to conduct an in vitro study which investigates the influence of hydrofluoric acid (HF) concentration, etching time and silane type on the microtensile bond strength (µTBS) of lithium disilicate to resin composites. Thirty-nine IPS e.max CAD blocks were randomly divided between thirteen groups (n = 3). The variables were HF concentration (9.5 or 4.9%), etching time (20 or 60 s) and silane type (Bis-Silane, Monobond Plus and ESPE Sil Silane). The blocks were cut into beams, aged for 10,000 cycles in a thermocycler and submitted to tensile stress to determine µTBS. A control group featuring the Monobond Etch & Prime (MEP) agent that combines etching/silanisation into a simultaneous process was also added. This group was discarded from the analysis due to only having pre-test failures. The data were analysed using a three-way ANOVA (α = 0.05). The HF concentration, etching time and silane type significantly influenced µTBS (p < 0.001). Significant interactions between time and silane type (p = 0.004), HF concentration and silane type (p < 0.001) and among the three factors (p < 0.001) were noted. Etching lithium disilicate with 9.5% HF (60 s), followed by the application of Bis-Silane, resulted in the highest µTBS (16.6 ± 9.0 MPa). The highest concentration and etching time under study, combined with a two-part silane, resulted in the highest bond strength, while the application of MEP showed a complete pre-test failure.",Materials,10.3390/ma15051847
Effect of Gamma Irradiation on Strength Properties of Basalt Composites,"© 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The problem of improving the strength properties of polymer composite materials based of roving made of basalt complex filaments and epoxy resin as a binder was considered. The main objective of the research is to analyze the physical and mechanical characteristics of basalt composites, as well as the possibilities of their modification by embedding the multiwalled carbon nanotubes and the effect of gamma radiation at different doses. The experimental results for both the pure binder and the basalt composite were presented. It was concluded that the complex modification based on gamma irradiation and embedding the multiwalled carbon nanotubes increases more than 20% the compressive strength on the specimens made of EDT-10P epoxy binder. The strength and elastic modulus investigations carried out on the ring specimens made of basalt composite, subjected to nanomodification and gamma irradiation, showed in increase in the strength characteristics at certain radiation doses within 10-15%. Hypotheses, explaining the strengthening effect associated with changes in the intermolecular interactions under an action of gamma-quantum flux were proposed.",Mechanics of Composite Materials,10.3390/app12052572
An Integrated Capture of Red Mud and One‐Step Heat‐Treatment Process to Recover Platinum Group Metals and Prepare Glass‐Ceramics from Spent Auto‐Catalysts,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Co‐treatment for two kinds of hazardous solid waste is an effective method to reduce cost and increase recycle efficiency of value resource. This work developed an integrated process based on capture of red mud (RM) and a one‐step heat‐treatment process to efficiently recover PGMs from spent auto‐catalysts (SAC) and reuse RM simultaneously. Firstly, the iron oxide in RM was reduced to metallic iron to capture PGMs by the reduction process, without the addition of an extra reducing agent, since SAC contained abundant organic volatiles. Then, the mixed waste of SAC and RM was melted under high temperature with additives of CaO and H3BO3. More than 99% of PGMs can be extracted under the optimal conditions of 40–50 wt% of RM addition, 14 wt% of H3BO3 addition, 0.7–0.8 of basicity, 1500 °C of temperature, and 40 min of holding time. In addition, PGM content in obtained glassy slag was less than 1 g/t. The mechanism of iron trapping PGMs was also discussed in detailed, which mainly contained two stages: migration of PGMs and separation of PGM‐bearing alloy and slag phases. Besides, the obtained glassy slag was further prepared into glass‐ceramic by a one‐step heat‐treatment process. It was found that the prepared glass‐ceramic has good thermostability and an excellent stabilizing effect on heavy metals. Overall, the results indicated that the developed integrated smelting–collection process is an efficient and promising method for the reutilization of SAC and RM.",Minerals,10.1016/j.matdes.2022.110521
The Structural Integrity and Fracture Behaviour of Teeth Restored with PEEK and Lithium-Disilicate Glass Ceramic Crowns,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a unique polymer material which has recently been introduced to dentistry. This study aimed to assess the structural integrity of PEEK as a posterior tooth crown and compared it with ceramic-based material. A total of 31 monolithic CAD-CAM PEEK (Juvora™, Strumann, Andover, MA, USA) crowns and 31 lithium disilicate (IPS e.max®CAD, Voclar Vivadent AG, Liechtenstein) crowns were created and cemented on dentin-like teeth (AlphaDie®MF, Schütz Dental GmbH, Rosbach, Germany) in a precise procedure mimicking the physical and mechanical properties of natural teeth and periodontal ligaments. A static compressive strength test using a universal testing machine and a dynamic fatigue test using a chewing simulator machine were used until crown failure to assess the fracture behaviour by mode of fracture (fractographic analysis) and 3D digital subtraction analysis. The results showed that PEEK has a greater fracture resistance than IPS e.max®CAD by 2060 N to 703 N. Additionally, in fatigue limit, IPS e.max®CAD showed a constant failure under 2.0 Kg (=320 N) before 5000 chewing cycles while PEEK survived at a significantly higher load > 11 Kg (930 N). Furthermore, PEEK showed a continued survival at >1,250,000 cycles while the mean fatigue life of IPS e.max®CAD was around 133,470 cycles. PEEK illustrated a significantly less catastrophic failure mode with some plastic deformation at the fracto-graphic stereomicroscope and in the 3D digital subtraction analysis. Using PEEK for crowns looks very promising, however, further clinical studies are required to assure this study’s results.",Polymers,10.3390/polym14050847
Development of monazite glass-ceramic wasteforms for the immobilisation of pyroprocessing wastes,"© 2022, The Author(s).Pyrochemical reprocessing is a potential route for the reprocessing of fuels from next-generation reactors. Lanthanide fission products may be separated from the reprocessing salt by a number of methods; however, salts may be entrained in the resultant product. This work demonstrates conceptual monazite glass-ceramic wasteforms based on the quarternary (100−x)(10Na2O–36Fe2O3–54P2O5)–xLa2O3 (x = 5, 10, 15), with La2O3 as a surrogate for the lanthanide oxide waste stream. Samples were produced by the melting of La2O3 with a sodium-iron-phosphate glass frit and characterised by XRD and SEM–EDX. The monazite phase was successfully formed at all waste loadings with clear segregation of La to the crystalline phase; however, high La2O3 loading (>10 mol%) was found to destabilise the glass system resulting in gross crystallisation. These initial results indicate that monazite glass-ceramics are promising wasteforms for this waste stream.",MRS Advances,10.3390/s22051970
Eu3+ as a Powerful Structural and Spectroscopic Tool for Glass Photonics,"© 2022 by the authors.

High-Temperature Behavior of CaO-FeOx-Al2 O3-SiO2-Rich Alkali Activated Materials,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Alkali-activated materials (AAMs) provide an opportunity to up-cycle several residues into added-value materials. Although generally praised for their performance under thermal loads, the thermal behavior of AAMs is dictated by a multitude of factors and the performance of CaO-FeOx-rich systems may differ from geopolymers. Therefore, this work ascertains the high-temperature resistance of CaO-FeOx-Al2 O3-SiO2-rich AAMs. Mortars were exposed to different heating rates (≤10◦ C/min) and temperatures (≤1100◦ C), and volume and mass loss, apparent density, compressive strength (CS), mineralogical composition, and morphology were evaluated. At low heating rates, the main effects noted were densification and a gradual lightening of color as the temperature rose. CS underwent an abrupt decline at 750◦ C and recovered at higher temperatures, reaching a maximum value of 184 ± 13 MPa at 1100◦ C. With an increased heating rate to 10◦ C/min, the strength loss at 750◦ C persisted, but maximum CS was halved when firing at 900◦ C. At 1100◦ C, a significant reduction of CS was observed, but all samples maintained their integrity. Except for 1100◦ C at 10◦ C/min, all sintered-AAMs presented residual CS above 40 MPa. These results demonstrate that CaO-FeOx-Al2 O3-SiO2-rich AAMs present interesting thermal behavior and can be potentially used to produce glass-ceramics or refractory materials from secondary resources.",Applied Sciences (Switzerland),10.3390/ma15051685
A new strategy to fabricate YIG ferrite joint with novel magnetic Bi2O3-CoO-Fe2O3-B2O3 glass,"© 2022 The AuthorsA new low-temperature magnetic Bi2O3-CoO-Fe2O3-B2O3 (BCFB) glass was designed to acquire magnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG/YIG) joint. This paper investigated the thermal behavior of BCFB glass and its wettability on YIG. The microstructural evolution, mechanical and electromagnetic properties of YIG/YIG joint were systematically studied. CoFe2O4 nuclei were gradually formed, growing up into nano-scale CoFe2O4 crystals in the glass seam. Meanwhile, some CoFe2O4 crystals grew up excessively by swallowing nano CoFe2O4, reaching microns. YBO3 reaction layer was formed and grew into YBO3 whiskers at the interface of YIG/glass with the brazing temperature increasing. The joint shear strength increased, reaching a maximum of 85.2 MPa at 775 °C under the collaborative reinforcement of well-integrated interface and glass-ceramic seam, then declined due to the aggravative reaction. The dielectric constant of YIG/YIG joints decreased with the brazing temperature increasing, varying from 18.5 to 16.6 at the frequency of 10 MHz. AFM/MFM and VSM analyses indicate that the glass seam performed magnetic property. The saturation magnetization of BCFB glass reached about 4.2 emu/g and 5.0 emu/g heat-treated at 750 °C and 775 °C, respectively, which could effectively enhance the magnetism of the glass seam.",Materials and Design,10.3390/ceramics5010011
Development of a Novel Friction Model for Machining Simulations in Unidirectional Composite Materials,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Constant coefficients of friction (COFs) are currently used in the literature to describe the contact mechanics between tool and workpiece for finite element (FE) machining simulation of carbon fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRPs). However, these are solely based on closed-loop tribology experimentation, which insufficiently represent machining conditions. To overcome this gap in the knowledge, this work proposes a novel experimental open-loop tribological testing method to produce a dynamic FE friction model for CFRP machining simulations. The newly proposed dynamic friction model is based on a function of fibre angle, contact pressure and slip rate, and it has been validated to both experimental results and constant COF FE simulations. The main aim of this article is to create a link between machining, tribology and FE simulation, by implementing cutting-edge tribological testing that results in highly accurate FE simulations. This dynamic model has been shown to improve the accuracy of open-loop tribological simulations, giving confidence in future implantation in CFRP machining simulations.",Polymers,10.1007/s10856-022-06651-w
Spatially Resolved Temperature Distribution in a Rare-Earth-Doped Transparent Glass-Ceramic,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Knowing the temperature distribution within the conducting walls of various multilayer-type materials is crucial for a better understanding of heat-transfer processes. This applies to many engineering fields, good examples being photovoltaics and microelectronics. In this work we present a novel fluorescence technique that makes possible the non-invasive imaging of local temperature distributions within a transparent, temperature-sensitive, co-doped Er:GPF1Yb0.5Er glass-ceramic with micrometer spatial resolution. The thermal imaging was performed with a high-resolution fluorescence microscopy system, measuring different focal planes along the z-axis. This ultimately enabled a precise axial reconstruction of the temperature distribution across a 500-µm-thick glass-ceramic sample. The experimental measurements showed good agreement with computer-modeled heat simulations and suggest that the technique could be adopted for the spatial analyses of local thermal processes within optically transparent materials. For instance, the technique could be used to measure the temperature distribution of intermediate, transparent layers of novel ultra-high-efficiency solar cells at the micron and sub-micron levels.",Sensors,10.1134/S1995421222010130
Study on the creep behavior of recombinant bamboo based on a modified generalized Kelvin model,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Recombinant bamboo is one of the commonly used natural fiber-reinforced composite materials in modern engineering. In this paper, the short-term tensile creep behavior of this material was studied. First, the standard tensile fracture experiments were conducted on nine species to provide the basic strength parameter. Then, six groups of tensile creep experiments were carried out based on the different stress levels. Finally, different viscoelasticity constitutive models were chosen to fit the strain–time relationship obtained by the experiment. The fitting results showed that the traditional generalized constitutive Kelvin viscoelasticity model can express the short-term creep behavior of the recombinant bamboo under high stress levels but will result in some errors in analyzing the creep strain history under the low stress levels. While the proposed modified generalized Kelvin model can provide enough accuracy in fitting the time–strain relationship under all stress levels, it is thus more suitable for engineering applications.",Wood Science and Technology,10.1177/00219983211066389
"Enhanced Sinterability, Thermal Conductivity and Dielectric Constant of Glass-Ceramics with PVA and BN Additions","© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.With the rapid development of the microelectronics industry, many efforts have been made to improve glass-ceramics’ sinterability, thermal conductivity, and dielectric properties, which are essential components of electronic materials. In this study, low-alkali borosilicate glass-ceramics with PVA addition and glass-BN composites were prepared and successfully sintered at 770◦ C. The phase composition, density, microstructure, thermal conductivity, and dielectric constant were investigated. It was shown that PVA addition contributes to the densification process of glass-ceramics (~88% relative density, with closed/open pores in the microstructure) and improves the thermal conductivity of glass material from 1.489 to 2.453 W/K.m. On the other hand, increasing BN addition improves microstructures by decreasing porosities and thus increasing relative densities. A glass-12 wt. % BN composite sample exhibited almost full densification after sintering and presented apparent and open pores of 2.6 and 0.08%, respectively. A high thermal conductivity value of 3.955 W/K.m and a low dielectric constant of 3.00 (at 5 MHz) were observed in this material. Overall, the resulting glass-ceramic samples showed dielectric constants in the range of 2.40–4.43, providing a potential candidate for various electronic applications.",Materials,10.1557/s43580-022-00227-0

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Implantation of three-dimensional (3D) bioactive glass-derived porous scaffolds is an effective strategy for promoting bone repair and regeneration in large osseous defect sites. The present study intends to expand the potential of a SiO2–P2O5–CaO–MgO–Na2O–CaF2 glass composition, which has already proven to be successful in regenerating bone in both animals and human patients. Specifically, this research work reports the fabrication of macroporous glass–ceramic scaffolds by the foam replica method, using the abovementioned bioactive glass powders as a parent material. The sinter-crystallization of the glass powder was investigated by hot-stage microscopy, differential thermal analysis, and X-ray diffraction. Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the pore–strut architecture of the resultant glass–ceramic scaffolds in which diopside, fluorapatite, and wollastonite crystallized during thermal treatment. Immersion studies in simulated body fluids revealed that the scaffolds have bioactive behavior in vitro; the mechanical properties were also potentially suitable to suggest use in load-bearing bone applications.",Ceramics,10.1007/s10854-022-07800-1
Improved osteoblast function on titanium implant surfaces coated with nanocomposite Apatite–Wollastonite–Chitosan– an experimental in-vitro study,"© 2022, The Author(s).Background: There is a continuous research in the area of biomimetic coatings on the titanium (Ti) implant surfaces for improved survival and long-term successful outcomes in the field of dentistry and orthopedics. In-vitro approaches are ideal systems for studying cell-material interactions without complexity and interference observed in in-vivo models. Purpose: The present study was undertaken to evaluate the osteoblast characteristics and function on Ti substrates coated with the novel composite coating of ceramic apatite-wollastonite (AW) and polymer chitosan. Materials and methods: Ti substrate coated with composite AW-Chitosan was synthesized, using electrophoretic deposition. MG-63 cells were seeded onto the coated substrates and cellular morphology and growth was assessed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Laser Scanning Microscopy (LSM). Osteocalcin expression of the seeded cells was assessed by FITC tagging and LSM analysis. Alizarin Red S staining and Confocal LSM (CSLM) analysis was used to study the in-vitro mineralization on the titanium samples. Results: The AW-Chitosan coating on Ti samples by electrophoretic deposition exerted significant positive influence on cell proliferation, growth and mineralization as compared to uncoated titanium samples. Scanning electron microscopy and laser confocal microscopy experiments revealed that the coating was non-toxic to cells, enhanced adhesion and proliferation of MG-63 cells. Increased functional activity was observed by increased production of bone-specific protein osteocalcin and mineralized calcium through day 7 and 14. Conclusions: The present study underscores that optimal inorganic-organic phase nanocomposite crack-free coating created on Ti by simple, cost-effective electrophoretic deposition technique may have osteoconductive potential and may have wide application in the field of implantology.

Experimental investigation on the mechanical behavior and damage of 3D printed composites under three-point bending,"© The Author(s) 2022.Three-dimensional (3D) printing has been triumphantly applied for the manufacture of various composite components. In this work, acoustic emission (AE), X-ray micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) are used in conjunction with digital image correlation (DIC) measurement to investigate the mechanical behaviors of 3D printed continuous fiber reinforced composites under three-point bending test. Meanwhile, several mechanical experiments are carried out to study the flexural properties of three kinds of composite specimens, among which the specimens with larger glass fiber content exhibit more superior mechanical properties. Furthermore, AE response characterizations and microscopic damage morphology are also examined. In consequence, the complementary nondestructive testing (NDT) technology combining AE, DIC, and Micro CT is successfully applied to evaluate the mechanical behaviors of 3D printed composites, and the flexural deformation and damage are comparatively investigated for different composite specimens. The cross-validation results of cluster analysis (k-means), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA) show that AE parameters including frequency, amplitude, and RA value (rise time divided by peak amplitude) are closely associated with the damage process of different specimens. The results show that the PCA can confirm the selected K-means cluster analysis parameters (peak frequency and peak amplitude) and the dimensionality reduction effects of 20% glass fiber specimens have the best results, indicating that the proportion of the principal components extracted can represent the original parameters is 81%. It was also confirmed that the supervised learning KNN algorithm corresponding to different damage patterns can verify the unsupervised learning k-means cluster. Correspondingly, the strain fields characterized by DIC are reasonably matched with the AE signal responses. In addition, the critical damage and delamination mechanisms of the 3D printed continuous fiber reinforced composites are clearly revealed by Micro-CT characterization.",Journal of Composite Materials,10.1177/00219983211065549
Characterisation of glass ceramic wasteforms using quantitative image analysis of electron micrographs,"© 2022, The Author(s).Multi-phase material systems make up a significant proportion of the currently proposed and researched wasteforms for sequestration of heterogeneous nuclear material feeds. Quantification of the components for such multi-phase assemblages is typically performed using diffraction-based Rietveld methods, many of which necessitate long measurement times of several hours. Furthermore, careful additions of an internal standard are typically required, to facilitate inclusion of amorphous phases in the quantification. The application of an image analysis method has been investigated, using the z-contrast greyscale of back-scattered electron micrographs to determine the relative quantities of component phases in a suite of monolithic phosphate glass ceramic wasteforms. This work demonstrates an alternate methodology for accelerated quantification which could be applied to other heterogeneous wasteforms and multi-phase materials.

Conveniently controllable design of nano-Al-doped@Co3O4 energetic composite with enhanced exothermic property via exploring electrophoretic assembly dynamics,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Achieving controllable film-forming process is always a difficult issue for practical application, especially for bi-/multiple component composite materials. Thus, this paper firstly developed a conveniently and controllable electrophoretic assembly technique under mild conditions to design nano-Al-doped@Co3O4 energetic film with wide potential applications. The stable suspension consists of isopropyl alcohol with the tracing of polyethylenimine and tween 80. The high crystallinity and uniformity of structure in target films were demonstrated by FESEM, EDX, XRD, and FT-IR techniques. Electrophoretic assembly dynamics of Al/Co3O4 particles were deeply explored to provide a theoretical foundation for optimizing exothermic performance. The exothermic performance of target film can be accurately adjusted, and the output of heat (Q) and activation energy (Ea) can reach up to ~ 3.6 kJ/g (close to 85% of theoretical value) and low to 230.01 kJ/mol, respectively. This breakthrough will substantially push forward the facile functional film-forming process of different kinds of particles used in fields of electronics, military, aviation, etc.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,10.1002/adom.202102483
Masking ability of different ceramics upon various underlying structures,"© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Objective: To evaluate masking ability of different types and thicknesses of ceramics upon various substructures. Materials and Methods: Discs (Ø 12 mm, thickness 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 mm) were prepared from Bruxzir-Anterior® (Bc), Celtra-DUO® (Cc), and Vita-Suprinity® (Vc) (n = 15/group). Substructures (2 mm thickness) were prepared from natural dentine (Ds), tetracycline-stained dentine (Ts), zirconia (Zs), resin composite (Rs), and cast metal (Ms). A spectrophotometer was used to measure the CIE L*a*b* color coordinates of a specimen. Masking ability was determined from the color difference (∆E00) of ceramics between before- and after combining with substructure using ANOVA and Bonferroni test (α = 0.05). ∆E00 value was compared with acceptable clinical threshold (∆E00 = 1.8) and an ideal threshold (∆E00 = 0.8). Results: Type-thickness of ceramics and substructures were significantly affected ∆E00. Ts significantly influenced ∆E00 more than Rs, Ms, Zs, and Ds. No significant ∆E00 upon Ms and Zs was indicated. Bc completely masked Ts and Rs if thickness was ≥0.6 mm, and Zs, Ms, and Ds if ≥0.4 mm. Cc completely masked Ts and Rs if thickness was >1.6 mm, and Zs, Ms, and Ds if >1.4 mm. Vc completely masked Ts if thickness was >1.4 mm, Rs and Ms if >1.2 mm, and Zs and Ds if >1 mm. Conclusion: Ts is the most influential substructure impact on color appearance, requiring a minimum thickness of 0.6 mm Bc, 1.2 mm Vc, or 1.6 mm Cc to be perfectly masked. Clinical Significance: Masking ability was significantly influenced by the type and thickness of ceramic material and underlying structure. Monolithic zirconia had a significantly higher masking ability than lithium silicate/phosphate glass ceramic. Ts indicated the most influencial substructure impacting the color appearance of ceramic restoration, which require a minimum thickness of 0.6 mm Bc, 1.2 mm Vc, or 1.6 mm Cc to achieve ideal masking capability.",Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry,10.1016/j.rinp.2022.105255
Kinetics of viscous flow sintering of glass–zircon composites. Effect of zircon volume fraction and particle size distribution,"© 2022 The Author(s)Viscous flow sintering of glass–zircon composites was studied by isothermal and constant-rate heating experiments. The sintering curves fitted very well to the developed kinetic model, based on the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts (KWW) function. Increasing the zircon volume fraction and decreasing the zircon–glass particle size ratio was verified to slow down the sintering rate. The combined effect of these variables on sintering was interpreted on the basis of percolation theory. The influence of temperature on the composite sintering rate corresponded to the influence of this variable on glass matrix flowability. Dimensionless relationships between the kinetic parameters and zircon volume fraction and the particle size ratio were obtained, which were independent of the thermal treatment used.",Open Ceramics,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2022.103216
Interfacial Morphology between Ramie Fibers and Phenolic Resins: Effects of Plasma Treatment and Cure Cycle,"© The Author(s) 2022.Natural fiber–reinforced polymer composites offer many advantages over conventional composite materials, such as availability, low cost, inexpensive, lightweight, and high specific mechanical properties. However, the applications of these materials are still limited due to the challenges in achieving a good interface between the fibers and matrix. This is highly influenced by the fiber surface characteristics and the polymer matrix properties. Therefore, in this study, the surface characteristics of ramie fibers were modified using low-pressure plasma treatment in order to improve their interface to the phenolic resin. Furthermore, the effects of using two different curing cycles (acid cure and thermal cure) on the properties of short ramie fiber-phenolic composites were also investigated. A new method for making mats of random short ramie fibers was developed and used for the fabrication of composites containing plasma-treated fibers. The flexural properties of all composites were tested and the obtained fracture surfaces were investigated using LV-SEM. The results indicate that both plasma treatment and cure cycle conditions influence the fiber–matrix interface and consequently the flexural properties of the composites.",Journal of Composite Materials,10.1007/s12613-021-2360-9
"LZS bioactive glass-ceramic scaffolds: Colloidal processing, foam replication technique and mechanical properties to bone tissue engineering","© 2022 The AuthorsScaffolds are used in bone replacement because present biocompatibility, three-dimensional structure, and high porosity. However, despite the efforts, there are still significant barriers to the development of reliable, synthetic scaffolds to repair large defects is one of the challenges of regenerative medicine. Therefore, innovative solutions are needed better to meet the requirements of a minimally invasive approach while providing adequate vascularity and strength and mechanical reliability. In this sense, the obtainment of a material that satisfies all these requirements is very important. This work aims to evaluate the mechanical properties of glass-ceramic scaffolds of the LZS (Li2O–ZrO2–SiO2) system produced by the replica method. For this, detailed colloidal processing was carried out to identify the solids content, amount of dispersant, and the binder most suitable to produce scaffolds. Finally, the mechanical reliability of the most suitable composition was evaluated by Weibull statistics. Suspensions containing 47 vol% of LZS relative to glass and 0.2 wt % of dispersant were used. In addition, dispersion times and the amount of binder were adjusted. Scaffolds of bioactive glass-ceramics were obtained at 900 °C, replicating polyurethane foams. Then they were morphologically, structurally, and mechanically characterized. The obtained bioactive glass-ceramic scaffolds presented porosity up to 83%, compressive strengths comparable to those of trabecular bone, up to 1.3 MPa, in addition to pore size >300 μm, desirable to favor biological interests destined to the regeneration and formation of bone tissue, demonstrating the possibility of its use as a material for bone replacement or filling. The Weibull modulus found for the glass-ceramic scaffolds produced is 4.18: within the expected range of mechanical reliability for application in bone regeneration.",Open Ceramics,10.1007/s12613-020-2219-5
Amplified Spontaneous Emission from Perovskite Quantum Dots Inside a Transparent Glass,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe diverse optoelectronics systems can provide interesting design inspiration for photonics devices, ranging from optical modulators to light-emitting displays. With the increasing applications and requirements of optical interconnect in complex environments, an essential operation is increasingly being pursued to exploit the consolidation of various merits of basic components. Here, an optical gain from monodisperse CsPbBr3 quantum dots crystallized in a selected transparent glass is revealed. The threshold of amplified spontaneous emission increases from 7.4 to 100.4 µJ cm−2 with the temperature from 78 K to room temperature, accompanied with a high gain coefficient of 627.9 cm−1. A small fluctuation of the lifetime (≈10.5%) with temperature and the photostability (>12 h) with the excitation of femtosecond laser indicates the robustness of the crystallized CsPbBr3 quantum dots in the transparent glass. These demonstrations present a deep understanding of the optical gain in the composite of metal halide perovskites and transparent glass and pave a path for the potential applications of CsPbBr3-based glass–ceramics as a gain medium for coherent light sources including laser/incoherent diode, fiber laser as well as optical amplifier chips.",Advanced Optical Materials,10.1002/admi.202101869

"Phase evolution and properties of glass ceramic foams prepared by bottom ash, fly ash and pickling sludge","© 2022, University of Science and Technology Beijing.Municipal solid waste incineration products of bottom ash (BA), fly ash (FA), and pickling sludge (PS), causing severe environmental pollution, were transformed into glass ceramic foams with the aid of CaCO3 as a pore-foaming agent during sintering. The effect of the BA/FA mass ratio on the phase composition, pore morphology, pore size distribution, physical properties, and glass structure was investigated, with results showing that with the increase in the BA/FA ratio, the content of the glass phase, Si-O-Si, and Q3Si units decrease gradually. The glass transmission temperature of the mixture was also reduced. When combined, the glass viscosity decreases, causing bubble coalescence and uneven pore distribution. Glass ceramic foams with uniform spherical pores are fabricated. When the content of BA, FA, and PS are 35wt%, 45wt%, and 20wt%, respectively, contributing to high performance glass ceramic foams with a bulk density of 1.76 g/cm3, porosity of 56.01%, and compressive strength exceeding 16.23 MPa.

Highly Transparent and Self-Healable Solar Thermal Anti-/Deicing Surfaces: When Ultrathin MXene Multilayers Marry a Solid Slippery Self-Cleaning Coating,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHSolar anti-/deicing can solve icing problems by converting sunlight into heat. One of the biggest problems, which has long been plaguing the design of solar anti-/deicing surfaces, is that photothermal materials are always lightproof and appear black, because of the mutual exclusiveness between generating heat and retaining transparency. Herein, a highly transparent and scalable solar anti-/deicing surface is reported, which enables the coated glass to exhibit high transparency (>77% transmittance at 550 nm) and meanwhile causes a >30 °C surface temperature increase relative to the ambient environment under 1.0 sun illumination. Such a transparent anti-/deicing surface can be fabricated onto a large class of substrates (e.g., glass, ceramics, metals, plastics), by applying a solid omniphobic slippery coating onto layer-by-layer-assembled ultrathin MXene multilayers. Hence, the surface possesses a self-cleaning ability to shed waterborne and oil-based liquids thanks to residue-free slipping motion. Passive anti-icing and active deicing capabilities are, respectively, obtained on the solar thermal surface, which effectively prevents water from freezing and simultaneously melts pre-formed ice and thick frost. The self-cleaning effect enables residue-free removal of unfrozen water and interfacially melted ice/frost to boost the anti-/deicing efficiency. Importantly, the surface is capable of self-healing under illumination to repair physical damage and chemical degradation.",Advanced Materials,10.1007/s11071-021-07148-x

Polarization impedance at the Na-Na5YSi4O12 interface,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Na-ion solid-state batteries operating at room temperature are typically supposed to have a metallic Na anode for sufficiently high energy density. The less known but due to easy processing very promising Na-conducting Na5YSi4O12 glass ceramic is investigated regarding its interface resistance in contact with metallic Na electrodes. Two types of this material, with and without the addition of P2O5 as a glass-forming sintering additive, are investigated. The surface is treated by polishing to induce a defined roughness. Highly polished surfaces lead to incomplete covering with Na metal. In contrast, surfaces with higher roughness can be covered more homogeneously with Na and thus exhibit significantly reduced interface resistance. These measurements reveal the intrinsically small interface resistance between Na5YSi4O12 glass ceramics and metallic Na, which makes Na5YSi4O12 a promising electrolyte for Na-ion solid-state batteries. Prolonged contact of the electrolyte with humid air, like several days or weeks, leads to a strongly increased interface resistance. Thus, storage conditions and surface treatment of the samples after air contact need to be considered carefully.",Solid State Ionics,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.121377
Multi-mode readout via opto-mechano-photothermo-responsive luminescence from electron trapping material for optical information storage application,"© 2022Optical storage material is one of the promising candidates for next generation of information memory medium owing to large capacity, reusable rewritable, and rapid response performance. However, as the typical optical storage medium, electron trapping materials (ETMs) are limited in applications of information preservation or optical display technology due to their single readout route relying on photostimulated luminescence (PSL). A crucial limitation to the feasibility of multi-mode optical information readout is the inevitable mismatch between trap depth and the energy of external stimuli. In this study, by introducing Bi3+ ions as intermediate levels between deep traps and emitters, we developed a LiTaO3:Tb3+/Bi3+ (LTO) material that can simultaneously response to optical, mechanical, and thermal stimuli efficiently, showing as multiple trap-controlling luminescence. The tantalate material was endowed with opto-mechano-responsive readout capacity when assembled with polymer matrix. Moreover, by utilizing LiCaYb0.5Nd0.5(WO4)3 microcrystals (LCYW) with near-infrared-induced photothermy property, we designed a LTO-LCYW bilayer composite film then achieved non-contact thermo-responsive readout of optical information via photothermo-stimulated luminescence.

Nonlinear forced vibration analysis of composite beam considering internal damping,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.In a structure made of composite material, dynamic behavior must be analyzed in consideration of internal damping that occurs due to the damping property of the matrix material. In the present study, a methodology for modeling the damping properties of composite materials from the measured damping parameters is proposed. The hierarchical finite element method is used to analyze the nonlinear forced vibration of composite beams. The beam element used in the analysis has two nodal points, and each node has three degrees of freedom. The displacement of composite beam elements is expressed using Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, and the strain–displacement relationship is expressed by von Kármán theory. The internal damping of the composite material is calculated from the measured damping parameters. The nonlinear forced vibration equation is solved using the IHB method. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, the results calculated using the Conventional finite element method are compared with the results calculated by the method proposed in the paper. Based on this, a nonlinear forced vibration analysis considering the internal damping of the composite material is carried out and the corresponding conclusions are obtained.",Nonlinear Dynamics,10.1007/s11664-021-09378-6
Next-generation high-performance sustainable hybrid composite materials from silica-rich granite waste particulates and jute textile fibres in epoxy resin,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In recent years, extensive efforts have been made to prepare composite materials using renewable and sustainable raw materials. Albeit significant advancements in bio-based fibre-reinforced composites, high water absorption and eventual degradation in properties remain a persistent issue the needs to be addressed. In this study, the epoxy-based hybrid green composites were prepared, where granite waste particulates were used as filler in synergy with jute fibre reinforcement. Milled granite particulates were characterized for their physical, chemical, mineralogical, and morphological aspects. Composites were prepared using hand layup followed by compression moulding techniques with high filler percentages (30, 50, and 60 wt%) and jute fibre content (2 and 4 layers). The influence of filler and fibres on physical properties (water absorption, thickness swelling, and density), mechanical properties (tensile, flexural, and impact), electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity of the prepared composites were studied. Loading with 60 wt% of granite waste filler and 4 layers of jute fibres resulted in composites with around 5% higher flexural strength, 16% higher tensile strength, 148% higher impact strength, and almost 150% higher thermal conductivity as compared to neat epoxy. The composites also exhibited very low water absorption (0.1%) with a nominal increase in density while containing electrical insulation property despite decreasing volume resistivity. Due to the high amount of mineral waste and natural fibre usage, these materials have very low embodied energy content, thus making them cost-effective, sustainable, and environment-friendly materials for structural and architectural applications. Additionally, the study also provides a potentially viable route for the effective utilization of mineral wastes, such as granite, whose growing accumulation has serious ramifications for the environment, living organisms, and the economy.",Industrial Crops and Products,10.1016/j.dental.2021.12.015

"Eu3+ doped and Er3+/Yb3+ codoped glass ceramics containing NaLa(WO4)2 nanoparticles: Preparation, optical and temperature sensing properties","© 2021Eu3+ doped and Er3+/Yb3+ codoped glass ceramics containing NaLa(WO4)2 nanoparticles have been prepared and their optical and temperature sensing properties have been investigated. Strong diffraction peaks and elliptical NaLa(WO4)2 nanoparticles with well-defined lattice stripes are observed in the X-ray diffraction and transmission electronic microscope results, respectively. Great enhancement of the photoluminescence intensity of Eu3+ ions is observed owing to the selective entering of Eu3+ ions into the precipitated NaLa(WO4)2 nanoparticles. The improvement of visible upconversion emissions and near-infrared photoluminescence emissions of Er3+/Yb3+ ions are also attributable to the enrichment of Er3+/Yb3+ ions in the low phonon-energy NaLa(WO4)2 nanoparticles. The temperature dependence fluorescence intensity ratio was investigated and the temperature sensing characteristics was evaluated.

Influence of Sintering Duration on Crystal Phase and Optical Band Gap of Mn3+ -Doped Willemite-Based Glass-Ceramics,"© 2021, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.A conventional melt quenching technique was used to successfully fabricate Mn2O3 -doped willemite glass-ceramics (Zn2SiO4:Mn3+) produced from the ZnO-SLS glasses. The results from XRD revealed that willemite crystallization is improved by increasing the sintering duration. It was revealed that, as the sintering duration progressed, the phase formation shifted from amorphous to α-Zn2SiO4 crystal. In addition, the structural growth of willemite phases can be seen using FTIR spectroscopy. The results of UV-Vis spectroscopy indicated that the intense absorption occurs in the UV zone, with wavelengths ranging from 250 nm to 400 nm, while the optical band gap showed a decreasing trend from 3.61 eV to 2.52 eV. These results perfectly established that Mn3+ dopant is potentially beneficial for producing willemite glass-ceramics for optoelectronic applications.",Journal of Electronic Materials,10.1111/jace.18228
Do resin cement viscosity and ceramic surface etching influence the fatigue performance of bonded lithium disilicate glass-ceramic crowns?,"© 2021Objective: To assess the effects of a resin cement in high and low viscosity and distinct conditioning of the intaglio surface of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic crowns on fatigue performance of the crowns. Methods: Prosthetic preparations (full-crown) in resin epoxy and crowns in lithium disilicate glass-ceramic were machined and allocated considering 2 factors (n = 10): “surface treatment” (HF – 5% hydrofluoric acid etching, followed by silane application; or E&P–self-etching ceramic primer) and “resin cement” (high or low viscosity). The preparations were etched with 10% hydrofluoric acid and an adhesive was applied. The intaglio surfaces of the ceramic crowns were treated as aforementioned (HF or E&P) and luted with high or low viscosity. The bonded sets were subjected to fatigue testing (step-stress approach: initial load of 200 N, step-size of 50 N, 10,000 cycles/step, 20 Hz) and complementary analyses (fractographic, topographic, and cross-sectional bonded interfacial zone analyses) were performed. Results: Treatment with HF and silane with high viscosity resin cement (955 N/156,000 cycles) and E&P with low viscosity resin cement (1090 N/183,000 cycles) showed the best fatigue performance (statistical similarity between them). The failures originated from defects of the cement-ceramic interface, and the HF treatment induced a more pronounced topographical alteration. Significance: Distinct topographical patterns from the HF and E&P treatments induced better fatigue results for the specific viscosity of the resin cement. Therefore, the fatigue performance depended on the existing topography, type of intaglio surface's defects/irregularities after surface treatment, and how the luting agent filled the irregularities.",Dental Materials,10.1111/jace.18235
Evaluation of the flexural properties and failure evolution of a hybrid composite manufactured by automated dry fibre placement followed by liquid resin infusion,"© 2021The market for composites is developing rapidly due to the widespread general requirement for lightweight design in various industries. However, the proliferation of fibre-reinforced composites is limited partly due to the lack of ductility associated with these materials. Hybridisation of fibres has emerged as an important strategy to increase the ductility of polymer composite materials. In the present work, water based dispersion was used to develop a dry fibre carbon tape and a hybrid glass/carbon tape which are both compatible with automated deposition techniques. Dry fibre preforms were manufactured using laser-assisted dry fibre placement (DFP) and laminates were subsequently manufactured using vacuum assisted liquid resin infusion. The hybrid composite exhibited both higher flexural strength (8%) and higher strain-to-failure (58%) relative to the carbon based laminate. To understand the failure modes, X-ray micro-computed tomography was used in conjunction with interrupted flexural tests to monitor the evolution of damage. The progressive failure analysis revealed that for hybrid composites, damage propagation was delayed due to the staggered arrangement of glass and carbon fibres. The majority of damage in the hybrid composite was located in the carbon fibres tows.",Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.11.014
Surface milled by CAD-CAM system Vs laboratorial methods to simulate the milled surface: Effect on the resin bond strength to lithium disilicate glass-ceramic,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe aim of this study was to assess the resin microshear bond strength (μSBS) and the surface topography of lithium disilicate ceramic milled by CAD/CAM and to compare it with in-lab methods that simulate the topography of milled surfaces; thus, assessing the feasibility of those in-lab methods for in vitro microshear studies. The study was composed of 2 control groups (CAD/CAM group – discs were milled by a CAD/CAM system; POL – polished ceramics surface) and 4 testing groups (SiC – manual grinding simulation with #60 silicon carbide paper; WS – manual grinding with #60 wood-sandpaper; DB – grinding with a fine cylindrical diamond bur; MANDREL – grinding with a CAD/CAM bur coupled to a mandrel). After production, the ceramic samples were crystallized. Surface treatment with hydrofluoric acid (HF) and silane was performed on the bonding surface, then the starch matrices were filled by the resin cement and light-activated. The specimens (n= 45) were submitted to μSBS after 24 h of storage in water (37° C) and the failure pattern was analyzed. Topographic analysis, surface roughness, contact angle, and fractal dimension were performed. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests were run for roughness, while Bonferroni’ post hoc was used for μSBS data. Fractal dimension data was qualitatively assessed. No difference was found in the μSBS between in-lab simulation methods and the milled group, while the polished group presented the lowest μSBS values. The CAD/CAM milled specimens presented the highest roughness values, while the POL the lowest ones. In regards to surface complexity, no difference was found among all simulated groups and the CAD/CAM group, with an exception for the POL group. All conditions presented an increase in surface complexity after HF etching. Therefore, the resin bond strength to lithium disilicate glass-ceramic is not influenced by the in-lab simulation method, meaning they are predictable approaches when evaluating the resin bonding to the tested ceramic; the surface polishing underestimates the bond results in ∼40%.",International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.11.036
The effect of TiO2 and B2O3 on sintering behavior and crystallization behavior of SrO–BaO–B2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramics,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.To explore the influence of TiO2 and B2O3 contents on the sintering behavior and crystallization of SrO–BaO–B2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramics, the glass-ceramics with different TiO2/B2O3 ratios were prepared by sintering at 800 and 850 °C for 10 min. The results showed that the glass transition temperature and sintering temperature increased with increasing the TiO2/B2O3 ratio. The average bridging oxygen number decreased from 2.44 to 2.07, which revealed that the polymerization degree of the glass-ceramics decreased. With increasing the TiO2/B2O3 ratio, the crystallinity of the glass-ceramics and the homogenization of grains size were improved, and the precipitation of the SrTiO3 phase was promoted. The sample with a TiO2/B2O3 ratio of 0.62, which achieved excellent densification sintered at 850 °C for 10 min, showed a dielectric constant of 18.11, a dielectric loss of 3.93 × 10−3, and a thermal expansion coefficient of 10.04 × 10−6 K−1, indicating that the SrO–BaO–B2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramics have great potential in the application of low-temperature cofired ceramics.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.precisioneng.2021.11.009
Germanium-antimony-selenium-tellurium thin films: Clusters formation by laser ablation and comparison with clusters from mixtures of elements,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyQuaternary germanium-antimony-selenium-tellurium (Ge-Sb-Se-Te) thin films deposited from Ge19.4Sb16.7Se63.9−xTex (x = 5, 10, 15, and 20) glass-ceramics targets by radio frequency magnetron sputtering were studied using laser ablation quadrupole ion trap time of flight mass spectrometry. Binary, ternary, and quaternary GeaSbbSecTed clusters were formed and their stoichiometry was determined. By comparison of the clusters obtained from quaternary Ge-Sb-Se-Te thin films and those from ternary Ge-Sb-Te materials, we found that Ge-Te species are not detected from the quaternary system. Furthermore, Ge-Se and Se-Te species are missing in mass spectra generated from Ge-Sb-Se-Te thin films. From the Ge-Sb-Se-Te thin films, 16 clusters were detected while ternary Ge-Sb-Se glasses yielded 26 species. This might be considered as a signal of higher stability of Ge-Sb-Se-Te thin films which is increasing with a higher content of Te. The missing (Se2+, GeaSb+ (a = 1–4), and GeSec+ (c = 1, 2)) and new (Ge+ and SbbTe+ (b = 1–3)) clusters may indicate that some of the structural features of the films (Ge2Se6/2 and Se2Sb-SbSe2) were replaced by (GeSe4−xTex and SbSe3−xTex) ones. In addition, when comparing the stoichiometry of clusters formed from Ge-Sb-Se-Te thin films with those from the mixtures of the elements, only Sb3+ and SbSe+ were observed in both cases. The knowledge gained concerning clusters stoichiometry contributes to the elucidation of the processes proceeding during plasma formation used for the chalcogenide thin films deposition.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/ijac.13949
Glass-ceramic composites as insulation material for thermoelectric oxide multilayer generators,"© 2021 The Authors. Journal of the American Ceramic Society published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Ceramic SocietyThermoelectric generators can be used as energy harvesters for sensor applications. Adapting the ceramic multilayer technology, their production can be highly automated. In such multilayer thermoelectric generators, the electrical insulation material, which separates the thermoelectric legs, is crucial for the performance of the device. The insulation material should be adapted to the thermoelectric regarding its averaged coefficient of thermal expansion α and its sintering temperature while maintaining a high resistivity. In this study, starting from theoretical calculations, a glass-ceramic composite material adapted for multilayer generators from calcium manganate and calcium cobaltite is developed. The material is optimized towards an α of 11 × 10−6 K−1 (20–500°C), a sintering temperature of 900°C, and a high resistivity up to 800°C. Calculated and measured α are in good agreement. The chosen glass-ceramic composite with 45 vol.% quartz has a resistivity of 1 × 107 Ωcm and an open porosity of <3%. Sintered multilayer samples from tape-cast thermoelectric oxides and screen-printed insulation show only small reaction layers. It can be concluded that glass-ceramic composites are a well-suited material class for insulation layers as their physical properties can be tuned by varying glass composition or dispersion phases.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1007/s00170-021-08246-1
Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.4Ti1.4(PO4)3 promising NASICON-structured glass-ceramic electrolyte for all-solid-state Li-based batteries: Unravelling the effect of diboron trioxide,"© 2021 The Author(s)Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are the ubiquitous technology to power portable electronics; however, for the next-generation of high-performing electrochemical energy storage systems for electric vehicles and smart grid facilities, breakthroughs are needed, particularly in the development of solid-state electrolytes, which may allow for enhanced energy density while enabling lithium metal anodes, combined with unrivalled safety and operative reliability. In this respect, here we present the successful synthesis of a glass-ceramic Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.4Ti1.4(PO4)3 NASICON-type solid-state electrolyte (SSE) through a melt-casting technique. Being grain boundaries crucial for the total ionic conductivity of SSEs, the effect of the addition of diboron trioxide (B2O3, 0.05 wt.%) to promote their liquefaction and restructuring is investigated, along with the effects on the resulting microstructures and ionic conductivities. By the thorough combination of structural-morphological and electrochemical techniques, we demonstrate that bulk materials show improved performance compared to their powder sintered counterpart, achieving remarkable ion mobility (> 0.1 mS cm–1 at –10 °C) and anodic oxidation stability (> 4.8 V vs Li+/Li). The addition of B2O3 positively affects the grain cohesion and growth, thus reducing the extension of the grain boundaries (and the related grain/grain interface resistance) and, therefore, increasing the overall ion mobility. In addition, B2O3 is seen to contrast the microcracks formation in the LAGTP system under study which, overall, shows very promising prospects as SSE for the next-generation of high-energy density, safe lithium-based batteries.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1007/s00784-021-04219-6
Anorthite-based transparent glass-ceramic glaze for ceramic tiles: Preparation and crystallization mechanism,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdA series of high hardness anorthite-based transparent glass-ceramic glaze was successfully developed for ceramic tiles. These glazes were prepared by mixing a high-calcium frit (denoted as HCa) that can crystallize anorthite with other fluxes. The effect of HCa content on the crystalline phase, microstructure and properties of the glaze was studied. In addition, the phase transformation, microstructure evolution and crystallization kinetics of anorthite from frit glaze were investigated in detail. The results revealed that when the HCa content was 45–55 wt%, the glazes had excellent transparency with a hardness of 6.4–7.3 GPa, which was higher than conventional glazes. The XRD and SEM tests showed the crystallization of single-phase lamellar-shaped anorthite crystals up to 20–40 μm in length. Anorthite was found to crystallize directly from the frit glaze at 850 °C. The laminated anorthite was composed of thinner lamellae, and cracks were observed inside the large crystals. The activation energy of anorthite crystallization was about 420 kJ/mol, and the Avrami index (n) was 2.03−2.36. The n value indicates that the crystal is grown in two dimensions, which explains the formation of lamellar-shaped anorthite in SEM.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1111/ijac.13899
Semi-ductile cutting regime technology for machining Zerodur glass-ceramic microstructures,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Zerodur glass-ceramic has potential uses in many fields from aerospace to electro-optical industries due to its extremely low thermal expansion coefficient. However, being extremely hard and brittle makes it difficult to process using traditional machining methods. This paper deals with a novel hybrid technology for machining 3-D microstructures using Zerodur glass-ceramic. Based on a Semi-ductile cutting depth, experiments are conducted using different cutting modes: regular cutting, current-feedback cutting, and a current-feedback control strategy with high-frequency vibration-assistance. High-frequency vibration-assisted cutting creates extremely shallow microcracks on the surface of the glass-ceramic that facilitate the removal of material. It was also found that the designed diamond tool with a −70° rake angle and negative rake angle of abrasive-grains can produce an exceptional negative rake-angle press-cut effect helping to suppress brittle-fracturing from occurring. Experimental results show that the proposed ‘high-frequency vibration-assisted cutting’ mode with a ‘self-controlling cutting force’ can automatically adjust the tool feed-rate on-line, increasing the material removal rate and protecting the glass-ceramic against brittle-fracturing. A 3-D microstructure made of Zerodur glass-ceramic is successfully machined under semi-ductile regime cutting, confirming the feasibility of the proposed technology, and opening-up the potential for micromachining hard-brittle materials such as Zerodur glass-ceramics for commercial applications.",Precision Engineering,10.1016/j.net.2021.08.036
"Glass-to-metal seals for solid oxide cells at the Politecnico di Torino, an overview","© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyA summary and update of the research on the design, process, and testing of glass and glass-ceramic to metal seals for solid oxide cells (SOC) conducted during the last 13 years at the Politecnico di Torino, Italy, within our research group and with several international collaborations, is presented and discussed. Glass and glass-ceramic-based materials play a key role in SOC performance and durability as well as in the sealing and joining of metallic interconnects. The sinter-crystallization method is a powerful technique that is used to obtain dense and reliable glass-ceramics capable of providing hermetic joining and seals. The issues, learned from our experience, that have an impact on the lifetime behavior of glass and glass-ceramic to metal seals are briefly reviewed in terms of challenges and working conditions. The mechanical characterization of glass-to-metal seal materials has a crucial impact on the overall performance, as the metal–glass interface plays a key role on the final joining strength and reliability. Several glass compositions are presented along with results on their characterization and behavior as joining materials for metallic interconnects, with a focus on their potential use as SOC seals.",International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology,10.1039/d2tc00552b
Damage study of fiber-reinforced composites drilled by abrasive waterjet —challenges and opportunities,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.Owing to their excellent properties such as lightweight and high strength, fiber-reinforced composite materials are widely used as ideal materials for key structural components in extreme service environments (e.g., aviation, aerospace, and nuclear power). However, due to their non-uniformity and anisotropy, they have become typical difficult-to-machine materials, which are prone to cause damage during machining, thereby reducing the service life of the entire component. This review primarily summarizes the damage (including delamination, thermal damage, tool wear, and other processing damages) and suppression strategies of scholars in the process of traditional and non-traditional machining of fiber-reinforced composite materials in the past few years. Besides reviewing the research progress, the limitations of the current research were presented. From this review, it can be seen that traditional and non-traditional (e.g., laser machining) machining methods are difficult to avoid damage. Abrasive waterjet (AWJ) machining is a green and environmentally friendly machining technology. Some key issues are expected to be furtherly solved during the AWJ drilling of fiber-reinforced composite materials with low damage.",International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,10.11896/cldb.20050183
Fatigue behavior and stress distribution of molars restored with MOD inlays with and without deep margin elevation,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Objectives: This study evaluated the effect of deep margin elevation (DME) and restorative materials (leucite-reinforced glass–ceramics [C] vs. indirect resin composite [R]) on the fatigue behavior and stress distribution of maxillary molars with 2-mm deep proximal margins restored with MOD inlay. Methods: Fifty-two extracted human third molars were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 13): C; DME + C; R; and DME + R. Inlays were fabricated in CAD-CAM and bonded to all teeth. The fatigue behavior was assessed with the stepwise stress test (10,000 cycles/step; step = 50 N; 20 Hz; initial load = 200 N). Fatigue failure loads and the number of cycles were analyzed with 2-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (p < 0.05) and Kaplan–Meier survival plots. The stress distribution was assessed with finite element analysis. The models were considered isotropic, linear, and homogeneous, and presented bonded contacts. A tripod axial load (400 N) was applied to the occlusal surface. The stress distribution was analyzed with the maximum principal stress criterion. Results: For fatigue, there was no difference for DME factor (p > 0.05). For the material factor, the load and number of cycles for failure were statistically higher in the R groups (p < 0.05). The finite element analysis showed that resin composite inlays concentrated more stress in the tooth structure, while ceramic inlays concentrated more stress in the restoration. Non-reparable failures were more frequent in the resin composite inlays groups. Conclusions: DME was not negative for fatigue and biomechanical behaviors. Resin composite inlays were more resistant to the fatigue test, although the failure mode was more aggressive. Clinical significance: DME does not impair mechanical behavior. Resin composite inlays failed at higher loads but with a more aggressive failure mode.",Clinical Oral Investigations,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.162606
Pressureless joining of SiC ceramics with magnesia-alumina-silica glass ceramics,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyLiquid phase sintered SiC ceramics were joined using magnesia-alumina-silica (MAS) glass-ceramic fillers without applied pressure. Four different filler compositions with 9.3–25.2 wt.% MgO, 20.7–33.6 wt.% Al2O3, and 49.2–68.1 wt.% SiO2 were studied. The effects of filler composition and joining temperature (1450–1600°C) on the joint strength were investigated. All compositions exhibited an optimum joining temperature at which the maximum joint strength was obtained. A low joining temperature resulted in poor wetting of the SiC substrate due to the high viscosity of the filler. Whereas a high joining temperature caused dewetting and large unfilled sections in the interlayer due to the deleterious interfacial reactions. The joint strength was inversely proportional to the interlayer thickness, which was a function of filler composition and joining temperature. The SiC ceramic joined at 1525°C with MgO-25 wt.% Al2O3-60 wt.% SiO2 filler exhibited a four-point bending strength of 286 ± 40 MPa.",International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.162673
Partitioning effects and corrosion characteristics of oxyapatite glass-ceramic wasteforms sequestering rare-earth elements,"© 2021Oxyapatite[Ca2Nd8(SiO4)6O2] glass-ceramics have been suggested as wasteforms for the immobilisation of rare-earth radioactive nuclides because of their high waste-loading capability and good chemical durability. In particular, a partitioning effect is predicted to contribute to an enhancement of corrosion resistance in glass-ceramics compared with that of conjugate glasses of the same composition. Because rare-earths are inherently insoluble nuclides, detection of changes in corrosion behavior between glass-ceramics and conjugate glasses under normal conditions is not easy. In this study, therefore, we revealed the partitioning effect by exposing glass-ceramics and glasses to solution of pH 2, 7 and 10 at 90 °C for 20 d. In addition, we proposed the corrosion mechanism for oxyapatite glass-ceramics under various corrosion conditions. Especially, the glassy phase dissolved first, followed by the oxyapatite phase during pH 7 corrosion.",Nuclear Engineering and Technology,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.162644
Tunable luminescence in Pr3+ single-doped oxyfluoride glass ceramic and fibers,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Compared with conventional white light emitting diodes, white lasers are highly desired for application in visible light communication due to their higher modulation bandwidth and light output power. However, the generation of white lasers in a single monolithic material constitutes a significant challenge due to its exacting requirements in the sophisticated design for simultaneous red, green, and blue oscillation. Herein, through a facile strategy, the design and preparation of a single monolithic material (the Pr3+ single-doped transparent glass ceramic (GC)) for emission color manipulation and white light generation are reported. By controlling the growth of 5-30 nm KYF4 nanocrystals in the glass matrix, the local field environment of Pr3+ evolves from an amorphous glass matrix to KYF4 nanocrystals, resulting in the emission color tuning from red via warm white to cold white. Impressively, the GC heat-treated at 520 °C for 2 h exhibits enhanced blue emission intensity which is approximately two orders of magnitude larger than that of glass. The feasibility of the target crystal growth in the glass matrix is validated via molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, a GC fiber with bright white light emission is successfully constructed. This work of tunable multicolor emission and white light generation from the Pr3+ single-doped GC opens up a new avenue for the development of modulated white light GC fiber lasers for application in future visible light communication.",Journal of Materials Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c10230
Research Progress of Rice Husk Based Materials in the Field of Water Pollution Control 稻壳基材料应用于水污染治理领域的研究进展,"© 2022, Materials Review Magazine. All right reserved.With the rapid development of industry, wastewater discharged from electroplating equipment, mining, textile and other industries contains a large amount of heavy metal ions and organic pollutants, which seriously endangers human health. Therefore, how to quickly and effectively treat heavy metal ions and organic pollutants in water bodies is an urgent problem in the field of environmental remediation. Rice husk is widely used in the fields of adsorption materials and photocatalytic materials because of its wide-source, renewable, and environmentally friendly characteristics. A large number of studies have shown that rice husk can remove many types of heavy metal ions and organic matter in polluted water, but its ability to remove most pollutants is not strong, and it is difficult to be further promoted in practical applications. Using rice husk as a matrix material to prepare functional materials with efficient removal ability has been a research hotspot in the field of environmental remediation in recent years. At present, researchers are trying to modify the rice husk by carbonization and chemical modification to increase the specific surface area and porosity, or increase the number of oxygen-containing functional groups, with the adsorption performance also improved. However, the above modified rice husk materials have problems such as weak adsorption capacity and easy secondary pollution.The study found that the magnetic rice husk biochar composite material prepared by loading Fe3O4 not only has strong adsorption performance, but also has the advantages of easy separation, strong stability, and no secondary pollution to the environment. It is a rice husk-based material in practical applications and the promotion laid the foundation. In addition, studies have reported that using SiO2 in rice husk as a support for semiconductor photocatalysts (such as TiO2, Ni2O3) can improve its photocatalytic performance and recycling rate, making it have good performance in the optical field. This article reviews the properties of rice husk itself and the methods of preparing rice husk-based adsorbent by modified rice husk, and discusses the application of rice husk-based and its composite materials as adsorbents and photocatalysts in the field of water pollution control. From the perspective of different types of pollutants, this paper discusses the effects of rice husk doping material function and system action mechanism in the treatment of heavy metal ions and organic pollutants. It also analyzes the important factors affecting the adsorption of pollutants. The application of materials in the field of water treatment is summarized and future research directions are prospected.",Cailiao Daobao/Materials Reports,10.1088/1742-6596/2200/1/012024
Novel 3.1 µm and enhanced 2.7 µm emissions in Er3+ doped fluorotellurite glasses ceramic,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.A detailed spectroscopic analysis was reported in a series of Er3+ doped 60TeO2-30ZnF2-10NaF (mol%, TZNF60) glass ceramics. When compared with the precursor fluorotellurite glass, the corresponding glass ceramic owns broader 2.7 µm emission with a FWHM of 193 nm and relatively invariable decay lifetime of 1.40 ms. In additions, a novel 3.1 µm emission also arised from Er3+ ions 4I11/2→4I13 /2 transition was observed after heating treated the precursor glass. The combination of absolute elimination of OH group (~0.01 cm−1), and lower phonon energy of NaF crystals (~400 cm−1) is beneficial to the realization of the intense 2.7 µm and newfangled 3.1 µm emissions. By analyzing the results of XRD and SEM, it is found that more Er3+ ions embedded into the NaF nano-crystallized circumstance with the prolong of holding time, resulting in bigger stimulated emission cross sections with a maximum of 5.5 × 10−20 cm2 and longer lifetime (≥2.44 ms) and therefore greater FOM value of 12.85 × 10−20 ms cm2 for 3.1 µm emission. As result, it is considered that Er-doped fluorotellurite glass ceramic is a potential host material for the applications of broad band mid-infrared lasers.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1088/1742-6596/2194/1/012042
"Preparation, crystallization kinetics, and optical temperature sensing properties of Er3+-Yb3+ co-doped fluorosilicate glass-ceramics containing ZnAl2O4 crystals","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Er3+-Yb3+ co-doped glass-ceramics were fabricated by the conventional melt-quenching method and subsequent heat treatment. The precipitation of ZnAl2O4 microcrystals with spinel structure was confirmed by the XRD pattern and SEM photographs. Raman spectra show that the glass-ceramics have lower maximum phonon energy compared with the glass matrix. Under the excitation of 378 nm Xenon lamp and 980 nm laser, different degrees of enhancement in the visible, NIR, and up-conversion fluorescence intensity attributed to the transitions of Er3+ ions in glass-ceramics, can be observed by emission spectra. Finally, according to the fluorescence intensity ratio between the transition from the thermal coupling energy level 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 to the ground state 4I15/2, the optical temperature sensing properties of glass-ceramics were evaluated, and the maximum absolute sensitivity Sa-max of 0.006 K−1 can be obtained at 404 K. These results indicate that the Er3+-Yb3+ co-doped ZnAl2O4 glass-ceramics may be utilized as a potential high-sensitivity up-conversion optical temperature sensing material.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1088/1742-6596/2194/1/012013
Exploring the electrochemical properties of Na2S -V2O5-P2O5 glass-ceramic nanocomposites as a cathode for magnesium-ion batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.High charge density of Mg yields the sluggish kinetic of Mg2+ insertion/extraction in the host lattice, this is a main difficulty to realize the commercial applications. As an attempt to overcome this challenge, a glass sample (NSVP) was prepared following the molar ratio (13.5 Na2S – 32.5 V2O5–54 P2O5) mol% using the melt-quenching process in addition to its corresponding glass-ceramic nanocomposites. All samples were employed in a fully assembled Mg ion coin cell at both room temperature and 55 °C. The CV, CA, GCD and EIS were reported for all the present samples. The diffusion coefficient of Mg ions ~10-16 indicates that Mg ion diffusion in the prepared host structures is moderately favorable. The 12 h sample achieved the best electrochemical performance at both temperatures (e.g., the highest initial capacity ~86 mAh g-1, energy density ~11 Wh Kg-1 at 55 °C and high stability). Its coulombic efficiency was 78% at 55 °C after 100 cycles. This can be due to smaller crystalline size (42 nm) and/or due to the flexible structure of β-VOPO4 having corner-sharing VO5 pyramids along with PO4 tetrahedra, similar to VO5F octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra in Na3V2O2F(PO4)2.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1088/1742-6596/2194/1/012039
SnF2-Doped Cs4PbBr6Glass Ceramic as a High-Performance Anode for Li-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Halide perovskite crystal glass ceramics show excellent electrochemical performance as glass anodes. Halide perovskite crystal glass ceramics can not only supply storage location by an open network and perovskite but also stabilize ion channels for lithium by the open network structure, just as [GeOδ] and [BOγ] units and so on. But in the long-running charge and discharge process, the specific capacity is not exactly so well. Herein, a SnF2-doped Cs4PbBr6 halide perovskite crystal glass ceramic was prepared by the traditional melt-quenching method. SnF2 as a notable doped material could increase lithium storage sites in the halide perovskite crystal glass ceramic. The prepared SnF2-GC is divided into two layers: one is a pure phase of crystals (named FLI) and the other is a bulk of mixed phase (named FLII). FLII has shown better electronic performance. The specific capacity of FLII achieved is 773 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, except that Sn participated in the charging and discharging process. F ions could also improve the stability of FLII.

As for the NOMEX paper honeycomb sandwich panels, two types of damage are found: fiber fracture and honeycomb core extrusion fracture. When the punch mass is constant, the greater the impact energy is, the more serious the damage is; and when the impact energy is constant, the greater the punch mass is, the more serious the damage is.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,10.1039/d1nj05015j
Experimental study on bond strength failure of GFRP lap joints,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Bonding has many advantages such as high adhesive strength, peel resistance, good toughness, shrinkage and corrosion-resistance, compared with bolting, welding and other connection patterns, which is the basic connection of the composite materials. The mechanical properties of the bond depend on the type and geometric parameters of the bond. In this paper, experiments were conducted to study the bond strength failure of GFRP single and double lap joints and explore related influencing factors. The variable factors of test specimens include bond type, length and thickness. The quasi-static tensile test was carried out at room temperature to analyze multiple influencing factors of lap joints and characteristic of GFRP bond failure strength. The results showed that the failure of the bond usually occurred at the interface of bond, and bond types, length and thickness have significant effects on the failure of bond. Failure strength increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of adhesive thickness. With the increase of bonding length, the failure mode of the double-lap joint become complex failure mode, which is accompanied by GFRP delamination near the surface of fiber of the bonding.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,10.1039/d1dt03918k
Cold-preventing simulation of low-temperature protective clothing based on an unsteady one-dimensional heat conduction model,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.With the development of science and technology, people are constantly exploring the extreme cold regions. In order to enable people to work normally in extremely cold weather, scientists have been studying low-temperature protective composite materials to protect workers in ultra-low ambient temperatures. This paper studies the cold-proof effect of low-temperature protective clothing composed of three materials.

"In Situ Growth Mechanism of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) Quantum Dots in an Amorphous Oxide Matrix","© 2022 American Chemical SocietyOxide glass matrix embedding is an effective way to improve the stability of halide quantum dots (QDs). However, the in situ growth mechanism of halide perovskite QDs in an amorphous matrix has not been clarified. In this work, the growth process of halide QDs in an amorphous oxide matrix was successfully elucidated via in situ spectroscopy, analytical electron microscopy, and the X-ray scattering/diffraction technique. The results showed that the in situ growth mechanism of the halide QDs in the amorphous oxide matrix was different from that of traditional glass-ceramics, which was more like a halide nanoglass-based phase transition process. Typically, a complex multiphase (halide nanoglass, CsPb2X5, and CsPbX3) transition existed in the amorphous oxide matrix, and the obtained CsPbX3 QD glass showed a halide multiphase coexisting microstructure. More importantly, the crystallization process from the halide nanoglass to QDs can be induced by known ways, including mechanical force, hydration, and heat treatment. The clarified in situ growth mechanism may pave the way toward the development of high-efficiency halide perovskite QD-embedded amorphous materials and optoelectronic devices.",Chemistry of Materials,10.3130/aijt.28.54
Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Li2Si2O5 Whisker-Reinforced Glass-Ceramics,"Copyright © 2022 Yan, Liu, Wu, Wu, Zhang and Li.Lithium disilicate (Li2Si2O5) glass-ceramics are an ideal material for dental restoration; however, their intrinsic brittleness and low defect tolerance limit the scope of their clinical applications. In this study, Li2Si2O5 whiskers were creatively synthesized via a mild-condition hydrothermal reaction. Self-reinforced Li2Si2O5 glass-ceramics were sintered by introducing the Li2Si2O5 whiskers, and their effects on phase, microstructure, and mechanical properties were systematically studied. The crystal-growth and toughening mechanisms were also discussed. The results showed that the Li2Si2O5 whiskers played an important role in inducing crystallization, and improving the microstructure and properties of the glass-ceramics. With increasing amounts of Li2Si2O5 whiskers, the crystallinities increased slightly, and the average crystal size also increased. The microstructure was composed of crystals of bimodal size distributions, in which some large, rod-like Li2Si2O5 crystals epitaxially grew along with the whiskers, and small crystals directly crystallized from the parent glass-ceramic powders. The Li2Si2O5 glass-ceramics exhibited high flexural strength (389.5 ± 11.77 MPa, LDW3), and fracture toughness (3.46 ± 0.10 MPa·m1/2, LDW5). The improved properties were attributed mainly to crack deflection and bridge-toughening mechanisms.",Frontiers in Materials,10.2298/SOS2201059C
Dye contaminated wastewater treatment through metal-organic framework (MOF) based materials,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche ScientifiqueAmong all the resources, water gets polluted greatly due to the extensive usability. Amongst all the anthropogenic pollutants, a variety of synthetic non-biodegradable dyestuffs are being released by various industries that pose a threat to the environment and public health. Hence, it is necessary to treat dye-contaminated wastewater using decontamination processes before the release of these dyes to the environment. The efficient way of removal is adsorption of dyes on cost-effective and solid adsorbents with higher capacity, but the conventional adsorbents are not satisfactorily efficient for removal of dyes. In the last few years, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been investigated for target-specific water treatment, which has led to the development of a class of porous materials and provided excellent platforms for the separation of dyes from water. Here, we intend to review the applications of MOFs and MOF composites in dye remediation from wastewater effluents in the last decade. Dye removal through MOFs has been discussed at length, along with the mechanism of the adsorption process. MOF composite materials, MOF-based membranes, newly formed magnetic MOFs, and aerogels/hydrogels have also been deliberated by comparing the results to other adsorbents used for dye removal. In addition, a thorough study on key factors affecting the dye adsorption process for increasing and improving their scope in practical applications has been done. In the end, the review concludes the study with future challenges and perspectives.",New Journal of Chemistry,10.1088/1742-6596/2206/1/012030
Erbium energy bridging upconversion mechanism studies on BAKL:Er3+/Yb3+ glass-ceramics and simultaneous enhancement of color purity of the green luminescence,"This journal is © The Royal Society of ChemistryBorate oxyfluoride glasses are transparent in the infrared, ultraviolet and visible regions and represent an ideal host matrix for optically active dopants. Due to their lower phonon energies compared to a silicate glass matrix, non-radiative transitions are suppressed and high luminescence efficiency is expected. This work reports on a complete upconversion (UC) luminescence study of the optically active B2O3-Al2O3-KF-LiO (BAKL) glass-ceramics incorporated with Er3+/Yb3+ ions. The triclinic BAKL:Er3+/Yb3+ glass-ceramic (GC) phosphor was synthesized using the conventional melt-quenching technique and the subsequent heat treatment of the precursor glass. The successful synthesis of BAKL:Er3+/Yb3+ GCs was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infra-red and differential thermal analysis measurements. The glasses were crystallized under controlled conditions, and the influence of phase composition (glass-to-crystalline phase ratio) on the wavelength and UC luminescence was thoroughly studied under 980 nm excitation. Interesting color tuning properties (white to intense green emission) of the sample were observed with laser pump power increment. The color tuning properties were explained using a new strategy i.e. the energy bridging mechanism between Er3+ ion clusters through an intermediate Yb3+ level. Moreover, their high color purity is well retained by varying the NIR excitation pump power densities and photometric characterization indicated the suitability in light emitting diodes and Er3+ doped fiber amplifier applications.",Dalton Transactions,10.1016/j.polymer.2022.124541
Microstructure Evolution of Magnetic Glass-ceramic Brazed Lithium Ferrite Joint and Simulation of Magnetic Properties 磁性微晶玻璃连接锂铁氧体接头组织演变及磁性能模拟,"© 2022 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.The glass joining technology of lithium ferrite can overcome the difficulty that the conventional sintering method cannot manufacture microwave ferrite components with complex structures, and the glass-ceramic can precipitate the in-situ magnetic microcrystalline phase in the ferrite joint, thereby realizing the structure-function integration of connected components. The glass-ceramics (LFBi5B,LFBi15B,LFBi25B) are designed for the joining of ferrite. The wettability of glass-ceramic, the effect of glass-ceramic composition and bonding temperature are studied, as well as the source of magnetism in the joint seam. The results show that the three glass-ceramics perform favorable wettability on YIG substrate. LiFeO2 crystals are precipitated in situ in the joint. Some of the precipitated crystals dissolve with the temperature increasing. A small amount of bismuth titanate whiskers are generated. The simulation via the first-principle indicates that the total magnetic moment of the crystal is not equal to 0, the upper and lower spin energy bands are asymmetric, and the state density diagram shows the spin-split state, which proves that the LiFeO2 crystal owns magnetism. The magnetism results from the exchange of electrons in the p and d states of Fe and O atoms. This investigation combines experiment and theory, realizing the in-situ growth of magnetic LiFeO2 microcrystals in YIG joint brazed by glass-ceramic, meanwhile verifying the magnetic source, which provides a new idea for the integrated design of structure and function of magnetic joints.",Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.131273

Characterization of Material Sintered from the Final Flotation Waste and Zeolitic Tuff,"© 2022 Authors. Published by association for ETRAN Society.The paper deals with the characteristics of synthesized glass-ceramics obtained by sintering a mixture of final flotation waste (FFW) with tuff at 1260o C for 7 h, followed by the annealing of pressed samples at 1080o C for 36 h. The experiments were done in order to find the possibility for the valorization of waste material (FFW). By thermal treatment of mixtures of T20 (20 % tuff, 80 % FFW) and T40 (40 % tuff, 60 % FFW) to a temperature of 1260o C over a period of 7 hours, is obtained glass-ceramics with dendritic structure. The synthesized glass-ceramics consists of two phases: iron oxide crystals (maghemite, magnetite, and hematite) and glass with an approximate ratio of phases 32/68 (T20) and 23/77 (T40), respectively. The relatively small shrinkage of the synthesized material (up to 7 %) enables reliable control when designing a given shape indicating that such glass-ceramics can be used as a basis for obtaining construction material. The synthesis of pressed samples of mixtures (T20 and T40) at 1080o C for 36 h produces glass-ceramics that have a high coefficient of sound attenuation, which indicates good acoustic insulating properties.",Science of Sintering,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.125597
Inversion of elastic constants of composite materials by single test based on virtual fields method,"© 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.In this paper, a method of obtaining four elastic constants of orthotropic composites by single tensile test is proposed. The principle of this method is to obtain the full field strain on the surface of the specimen through the tensile test of the specimen with a specific geometry, and to invert the measured in-plane strain field into the virtual fields method (VFM) to obtain the elastic constants. Based on the deformation field data generated by finite element numerical simulation, the effects of design parameters such as effective length, notch position, notch size and fillet radius on the identification results of elastic parameters of V-notch tensile specimen are studied. The results show that the inversion results of symmetrical V-notch specimen with 50 mm length, 12 mm notch size and 3.1 mm fillet radius are the best, and the sum of absolute relative errors of four elastic constants is less than 3%, which verifies the feasibility of the method.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.121346
Silk fibroin-Yb3+/Er3+:YAG composite films and their thermometric applications based on up-conversion luminescence,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSilk Fibroin (SF) is a well-known protein, and has been employed in the development of diverse advanced materials for applications on medical and biological field, drug delivery systems and, also, in the electronic and photonic area. In addition, the up-conversion emission process could be proposed in fibroin-based materials and becomes a challenge for the photonic field based on biocompatible devices obtained from fibroin. To avoid the unwanted upconversion (UC) quenching process, herein, lanthanide ions were used as sensitizer and emitters ions, and them was incorporated into an inorganic particle obtained from spray pyrolysis synthesis. Specifically, we have obtained Yb3+ and Er3+ ions doped YAG (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet, Y3Al5O12) spherical submicrometric particles, without spurious phases. All samples were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and photoluminescence. The spectroscopic studies showed an intense UC emission from Er3+ ions. Furthermore, looking for the development of a new fibroin composite which should be used as sensor or smart ink, we inserted the YAG particles in SF, and a new flexible composite film with controlled amounts of particles and tuned transmittance behavior was obtained. Finally, it was confirmed the characteristic luminescent behavior (as UC emission) of the particles in the composite films. As the emitters levels (2H11/2 and 4S3/2) from Er3+ ions are thermally coupled, all materials (particles and films) were exploited as luminescent thermometer, and data confirmed the thermal sensibility comparable to other systems based on Yb3+/Er3+ ions.",Polymer,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.121339
The critical role of surface area optimization in carbon quantum dots modified g-C3N4 for photocatalytic enhancement,"© 2021G-C3N4 has shown great potential in photocatalytic degradation. However, the layered structure of g-C3N4 may prevent the contaminant adhesion in the interlayers, which greatly limited its active surface area for photocatalysis. Herein, a simple and fast hydrothermal process was optimized: with appropriate synthesis temperature, carbon dots dispersed into the interlayer of g-C3N4 without destroying the frame structure, opened the layer distance of g-C3N4, enlarged its surface area by 3.56 times, and enhanced its photoresponse and photoredox capacity significantly. Excellent photocatalytic activities were observed towards organic dyes Rhodamine B (RhB). This work provides a new approach to optimize the layered g-C3N4 via surface area modification, which enhanced the design and fabrication of a g-C3N4-based photocatalyst.",Materials Letters,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230930
A unified quasi-three-dimensional solution for vibration analysis of rotating pre-twisted laminated composite shell panels,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThis study presents a unified quasi-three-dimensional (quasi-3D) solution for the free vibration analysis of rotating pre-twisted laminated composite shell panels. Based on the 3D elasticity shell theory, Carrera unified formulation is employed to reduce the complete 3D dynamic model to a hierarchical 2D dynamic model with a capacity for 3D solving accuracy. A separate quasi-static analysis is conducted to precisely acquire the centrifugal stresses that occur in the rotating laminated composite shell panels. The present quasi-3D dynamic model considers the Coriolis forces, rotational softening effect as well as prestress stiffening effect. Several case studies are presented including the rotating pre-twisted plates, pre-twisted cylindrical shell panels and untwisted conical shell panels with different lamination schemes and geometric parameters. In each case study, the vibration characteristics predicted from the present theoretical model are compared with the reported studies and those from the commercial finite element software. It indicates that the quasi-3D dynamic model has good accuracy and is appropriate for different types of rotating laminated composite shell panels. The influences of the rotating speed, pre-twisted angle, fiber orientation and subtended angle on the vibration behaviors of the rotating pre-twisted laminated composite shell panels are studied as well.",Composite Structures,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.11.122

The glassy nature of the samples was elucidated. Afterwards, the glasses were submitted to heat treatment, resulting in a glass-ceramic, and UV–visible spectroscopy revealed a red-shift in the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band of CuNPs. The glass-ceramic showed better SERS results in comparison to the glass and glass-metal composite, indicating an efficient enhancement mechanism to be investigated.

Structure/property nonlinear variation induced by gamma ray irradiation of boroaluminosilicate transparent glass ceramic containing gahnite nanocrystallite,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Transparent glass ceramics (TGC) used in radioactive condition should exhibit different characteristics from pure glass and pure ceramic. Boroaluminosilicate TGCs containing gahnite nanocrystallite was synthesized and irradiated with various dose of gamma ray and were comparatively characterized in structure and property. Phase and network microstructural analysis reveal nonlinear evolution of crystalline phase in addition to incidental improved network connectivity of the residual glass phase, which agree well with the derived parabolic relation with gamma dose based on thermal spike and crystallization kinetics models. Consequently, irradiation induced optical absorption of the TGC is lower than the precursor glass despite optical contribution of Ti4+ photoreduction. The variation of optical as well as mechanical properties upon irradiation reaches an extremum at certain dose followed by reversal to saturation at higher dose and is consistent with the nonlinear structural modification as a function of gamma ray dose.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.11.105
Crystallization resistance behavior of Al2O3-doped calcium bismuth borate glasses,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Glass ceramic phosphors provide an effective solution to solve the problems of poor high thermal stability for current commercial WLEDs. The transmittance of sealing glass is one of the key factors to achieve high luminous performance of glass ceramic phosphors. In this work, a relative high transmittance and superior crystallization resistance frit seal of Al2O3-doped calcium bismuth borate glasses were successfully prepared. The crystallization resistance behaviors related to structures, morphologies were investigated. As increasing Al2O3 concentrations from 0 to 6 mol%, the glass structure becomes more compact. The capability of crystallization resistance and transmittance for the second sintering samples increase with increasing Al2O3 contents. 6 mol% Al2O3-doped glass exhibits virtually amorphous state and the transmittance is close to 70%. The glass transition activation energy (Eg) and crystallization activation energy (Ep) of glass sample with low Al2O3 content are about 382 kJ/mol and 280 kJ/mol and the precipitation of crystal phase possibly is Bi4B2O9. The YAG:Ce3+ glass ceramic prepared with 6 mol% Al2O3-doped glass yields a LE of 123.2 lm/W, a CCT of 5856 K and a CRI of 67.6.

"White emitting 5ZnO-(5–2.5x)Ga2O3- 2.5xAl2O3–90SiO2 glass ceramic embedded with Mn doped Zn(Ga,Al)2O4 nanocrystals","© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Dual-emitting manganese ions singly doped 5ZnO-(5–2.5x)Ga2O3-2.5 xAl2O3–90SiO2 glass-ceramic (GCs) samples, containing the alloyed Zn(Ga, Al)2O4 nanocrystals with a size of about 5 nm, were successfully prepared by a sol-gel method under different heat treatment temperatures, demonstrating an excellent white light emission. We found that the formation of the ZnGa2O4 nanocrystals began at 650 °C (absence of Al2O3, x = 0) while that of the ZnAl2O4 crystals required a higher temperature of about 900 °C (presence of Al2O3, x = 2) in SiO2 glasses. A nanostructured Zn(Ga, Al)2O4:Mn2+, Mn4+ in the glass-ceramic was synthesized by Al3+ replacing part of Ga3+. The doping of Al3+ has effectively contributed to the existence of Mn2+, thus realizing the regulation of the valence state of manganese ions. The glass ceramic samples showed red emission arrived from the 2Eg → 4A2g transitions of Mn4+, green emission originated from the 4T1→6A1 transition of Mn2+, and blue emission derived from the self-activation center of ZnGa2O4 nanocrystalline. In particular, the 0.1%Mn doped the 5ZnO-(5–2.5x)Ga2O3-2.5xAl2O3–90SiO2 glass-ceramic samples can provide white color emission depending on the Al doping concentration (x), x = 0.4–0.9 and the annealing temperature, 650–900 °C.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.11.042
KLaF4:Nd3+doped transparent glass-ceramics processed by spark plasma sintering,"© 2021 The Author(s)Transparent oxyfluoride glass-ceramics (GCs) containing KLaF4 nanocrystals (NCs) doped with Nd3+were prepared by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS). Glass powder pellets were sintered under a vacuum atmosphere, optimizing the processing parameters such as particle size, pressure, temperature, and holding time to obtain full densification. Transparency decreased when decreasing the particle size due to higher carbon contamination from the die. The α-KLaF4 crystalline phase was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and its average crystal size was 10–20 nm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) confirmed the presence of KLaF4 nanocrystals with incorporated Nd3+ions. Low-temperature site-selective emission and excitation spectra of Nd3+ions confirmed that α- KLaF4 was the predominant polymorph, although a minor presence of β- KLaF4 was also demonstrated.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.10.247
Enhanced defect emission of TiO2-doped transparent glass-ceramics embedding ZnO quantum dots with optimized heat-treatment schedule,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.This work mainly concentrated on the structural and optical properties of TiO2-doped transparent glass-ceramics embedding ZnO quantum dots (QDs). The results show that the concentration of non-bridging oxygen and related defects in the glasses increases and thermal parameters decreases by the introduction of TiO2. The surface defect concentration of ZnO QDs is greatly improved and the size of ZnO QDs is reduced by heat treatment below the Tg and the introduction of TiO2. The green emission of glasses is mainly derived from oxygen vacancy defects and the yellow emission of glass-ceramics primarily originated from oxygen interstitial defects which show a tendency of enhancing first and then reducing with the increase of TiO2 content. Among them, the optimal content for the strongest emission intensity of TiO2-doped glasses and glass-ceramics was determined to be 1.0 mol%, and the relative exceeds 10 times and 5.4 times that of TiO2-free glasses and glass-ceramics, respectively. The average size of ZnO QDs (∼2.1 nm) remarkably close to its exciton Bohr radius is successfully prepared by the optimal heat treatment condition (630 °C/8 h, below the Tg). The results show that these glass-ceramics embedding ZnO QDs are good yellow emission materials and have application prospects in WLEDs.",Ceramics International,10.1063/5.0074737
Optimizing the energy storage and charge-discharge performance of borate glass-ceramics by adjusting the glass structure,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.In this work, the niobate-based borate glass-ceramic system K2O–Na2O–Nb2O5–B2O3 was proposed for the first time, in which the presence of alkali metal oxides not only tends to form ferroelectric crystalline phase to obtain high permittivity, but also optimizes the borate glass network structure to enhance the breakdown strength. The change of borate glass network structure and the influence on conductivity and carriers migrate is systematically discussed. The results show that the high breakdown performance is attributed to the transformation from [B∅2O−] triangle to [B∅4]- tetrahedron realizes the high extent of glass network polymerization, which effectively impedes carriers migration and reduces the conductivity. The high permittivity and low dielectric loss are obtained in the range of room temperature to 200 °C.

The thermal analysis indicated the presence of two exothermal peaks, the first at approximately 640 °C, characteristic of the crystallization of lithium metasilicate, Li2SiO3, and the second close to 820 °C, corresponding to the crystallization of lithium dissilicate, Li2Si2O5. In order to study the crystallization behavior the glass powder was uniaxially compacted and investigated by dilatometry. The samples were sintered under different conditions: Group 1: sintering at 840 °C with isothermal holding times of 5, 15, 60 and 180 min; Group 2: preheating to 660 °C with an isothermal plateau for 720 min and further heating up to 840 °C with identical holding times of 5, 15, 60 and 180 min. The sintered glass-ceramics were characterized by XRD, Rietveld refinement, SEM, relative density, hardness, fracture toughness and flexural strength. The results showed that the samples of group 1, directly heated up to 840 °C, achieved a relative density ranging between 60 and 70% and a hardness and fracture toughness lower than the second group that was subjected to a differentiated preheating process. The sintered samples for less than 60 min, presented Li2SiO3 and Li2Si2O5 as crystal phases and a microstructure formed by low aspect ratio crystals, besides apparent porosity. The samples sintered at 840 °C for 180 min, independently of the heating up procedure, presented only Li2Si2O5 as crystal phase with elongated grains with an aspect ratio higher than 2 and relative densities in the order of 84 to 91%. The hardness ranged in the order of 5.6 to 6 GPa and the average fracture toughness was 1.5 MPa m1/2. The materials subjected to the preheating process and treated at 840 °C for 180 min exhibited a flexural strength of 160 MPa, while those directly heated to 840 °C and treated for 180 min showed a flexural strength of only 75 MPa.",Ceramics International,10.1021/acsapm.1c01632
Effect of sintering temperature on solidification and migration of non-volatile and volatile heavy metals in glass-ceramic,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Using tailings as material to prepare glass-ceramic is an excellent way to achieve the resource utilization of solid waste. However, at present, researches on the solidification and migration of heavy metals are limited. Therefore, in this study, ten groups of samples were prepared by controlling sintering temperatures. The solidification, migration, and leaching behavior of non-volatile and volatile heavy metals were studied. The research showed that, with the increase of temperature, the properties of the samples were improved. Fe participated in the phase transformation and evolved into insoluble iron pyroxenes solid solution, while Pb was homogeneously distributed in the glass matrix of glass-ceramics. The leaching concentrations of Fe and Pb in the glass-ceramics were 0.055 mg/L ∼0.087 mg/L and 0.074 mg/L ∼0.140 mg/L, which were far below the threshold value. The results showed that heavy metals can be effectively solidified in glass-ceramics and have good environmental benefits.",Ceramics International,10.1021/acsapm.1c01535
Wear of zirconia/leucite glass-ceramics composites: A chewing simulator study,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Leucite and zirconia are commonly used in the production of prosthetic dental materials. Leucite presents attractive optical properties but low toughness and wear resistance, which limits its use. Zirconia has much higher toughness, but due to aesthetic reasons and ageing issues, needs to be glass veneered. Chipping of such veneer is usually responsible for the abnormal wear induced on the antagonist teeth. Leucite reinforced with 25% of nano-zirconia is a promising alternative to overcome these issues, allowing the production of dental restorations without veneer. This study aims to investigate if leucite-zirconia composites have suitable optical, mechanical and tribological properties to be used in dental restoration. Samples with different compositions of leucite and/or nano-zirconia were produced by unidirectional compression and characterized concerning density, surface morphology, roughness, hardness, toughness, and translucency. Wear tests were performed in a chewing simulator using human cusps as counterbodies. Tests were also performed in glazed zirconia for comparison. 25% ZrO2 leads to the lowest wear of the tribological pair among the studied systems, except 100% ZrO2. This can be attributed to the toughening effect of zirconia and reduced size of third body particles. Abrasion was the main wear mechanism observed in this pair. In addition, this was the composite that presented the highest translucency.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.162337
Quantitative evaluation of energy harvesting capabilities on flexoelectric and piezoelectric materials,"© 2022 Author(s).Piezoelectric and flexoelectric materials have attracted increasing attention for mechanical energy harvesting (EH) in various applications, owing to their simple configuration, easy accessibility, high compatibility, and electro-mechanical conversion efficiency. In order to quantitatively evaluate the EH capability of different types of piezoelectric and flexoelectric materials, a coefficient m is proposed in this work, defined as the ratio of the square of electro-mechanical coupling coefficients and dielectric constant. With this proposed coefficient, we elucidate the underlying mechanism for the reason that polymer, ceramics, and ceramic-polymeric composite materials demonstrate different levels of energy conversion capabilities in piezoelectric and flexoelectric EH processes. Additionally, this proposed coefficient was used to guide the selection of piezoelectric EH materials for the power supply of a load cell integrated in a petroleum pumping system under extreme environments.",Journal of Applied Physics,10.1039/d1dt04097a
Potential Load-Bearing Bone Substitution Material: Carbon-Fiber-Reinforced Magnesium-Doped Hydroxyapatite Composites with Excellent Mechanical Performance and Tailored Biological Properties,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.A potential load-bearing bone substitution and repair material, that is, carbon fiber (CF)-reinforced magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite (CF/Mg-HAs) composites with excellent mechanical performance and tailored biological properties, was constructed via the hydrothermal method and spark plasma sintering. A high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to characterize the nanostructure of magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite (Mg-HA). TEM images showed that the doping of Mg-induced distortions and dislocations in the hydroxyapatite lattice, resulting in decreased crystallinity and enhanced dissolution. Compressive strengths of 10% magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite (1Mg-HAs) and CF-reinforced 1Mg-HAs (CF/1Mg-HAs) were within the range of that of cortical bone. Compared with 1Mg-HAs, the fracture toughness of CF/1Mg-HAs increased by approximately 38%. The bioactivity, biocompatibility, and osteogenic induction properties of Mg-HAs and CF/Mg-HAs composites were evaluated in vitro using simulated body fluid (SBF) immersion, cell culture, osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), and expression of genes associated with osteogenesis. When Mg-HAs were immersed in SBF, Mg2+ continued to release for up to 21 days. Mg-HAs demonstrated a satisfactory ability to induce apatite formation in comparison with HAs. The cell proliferation and morphology on CF/1Mg-HAs were similar to those of 1Mg-HAs, suggesting that adding CF had no adverse effect on cellular activity. The expression levels of osteogenesis-related genes [osteocalcin (OPN), osteopontin (OCN), and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2)] on 1Mg-HAs were significantly higher at days 3 and 7 than those on HAs and 0.5Mg-HAs groups. This finding suggests that a certain amount of Mg doping had beneficial influences in the different stages of osteogenic differentiation and could induce osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. The new bone volume to total volume ratio of implanted 1Mg-HAs (30.9% ± 4.1%) and CF/1Mg-HAs (25.4% ± 5.4%) was remarkably higher than that of HAs (21.6% ± 3.9%). 1Mg-HAs and CF/1Mg-HAs tailored an ideal effect of new bone information and implant osseointegration. The excellent mechanical performance and tailored biological properties of CF/Mg-HAs were attributed to nano Mg-doped HA, CF reinforcing, refined microstructure, and controlled composition.",ACS Biomaterials Science and Engineering,10.1063/5.0075518
Polymer Composites with Cork Particles Functionalized by Surface Polymerization for Fused Deposition Modeling,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Cork powder received as a byproduct from local industries is valorized through the development of composite materials suitable for fused deposition modeling (FDM). For this purpose, a polymeric matrix of acrylonitrile-styrene-butyl acrylate (ASA) is used due to its good mechanical resistance and weather resistance properties. Prior to the manufacturing of the composites, the cork particles are characterized and modified by surface polymerization, creating a layer of poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA). Then, filaments for FDM are prepared by solvent casting and extrusion from ASA and composites with unmodified cork (ASA + C) and PBA-modified cork (ASA + Cm). PBA is one of the polymers present in the structure of ASA, which increases the compatibility between the cork particles and the polymer matrix. This is evidenced by evaluating the mechanical properties of the composites and examining their fracture surface by scanning electron microscopy. The analysis of the thermal properties shows that the developed composites also present enhanced insulating properties.",ACS Applied Polymer Materials,10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.127944
Influence of Inorganic Glass Ceramic Particles on Ion States and Ion Transport in Composite Single-Ion Conducting Gel Polymer Electrolytes with Varying Chain Chemistry,"© A major goal of next-generation battery development is the engineering of nonflammable solid-state electrolytes with high enough ionic conductivity to compete with traditional liquid electrolytes. Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs), which combine inorganic fillers or electrolytes with a polymer matrix, are seen as a strategy to boost the ionic conductivity of flexible polymer electrolytes while overcoming the brittle aspect of inorganic electrolytes. In this work, we examine the impact of polymer backbone chemistry on Li+ ion conduction within crosslinked single-ion conducting gel polymer electrolytes (SIPEs) that contain a lithium ion-conducting glass ceramic electrolyte (LICGC). Certain SIPE compositions based on poly(tetrahydrofuran) diacrylate (PTHFDA) crosslinking macromonomers exhibit a significant increase in conductivity with the inclusion of LICGC, a result unexpected from prior literature. With the use of Raman spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, and particle-induced gamma-emission spectroscopy (PIGE), it is proposed that the enhanced conductivity comes from the formation of percolated LICGC particles sheathed in an ion-rich domain. This region develops in the pre-polymer solution due to interactions between the LICGC particle surface and the ionic comonomer, much like the formation of space-charge regions in soggy-sand liquid electrolytes, and persists post-polymerization to yield a CPE of enhanced conductivity. The particle-ionic monomer interactions are modulated by the crosslinking macromonomer polarity, polymer casting solvent, and particle surface area. While there is ample room for continued optimization, the best SIPEs in this study are capable of Li metal dissolution/deposition, and they reach Li+ conductivities greater than 2 × 10-4 S/cm at 25 °C, surpassing the practical use threshold.",ACS Applied Polymer Materials,10.5005/jp-journals-10024-3244
"Long afterglow from multi dopant transparent and opaque glass ceramic phosphor for white, red, yellow, and blue emissions: Zn2SiO4:Eu3+, Dy3+, Mn2+","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In this paper, preparation of long afterglow phosphor with different emission colors in the system Zn2SiO4:Eu3+, Dy3+, Mn2+ was done via melt-quenching technique. The effect of adding mono-di- and tri-dopant on the phosphorescence properties was studied. Also, the effect of applying different heat treatment programs on the appearance of glass-ceramic (GC) to get transparent or opaque materials were optimized. DTA, XRD, SEM, UV–visible - NIR, and fluorescence spectrophotometer were used to characterize the obtained materials. The results revealed crystallization of willemite and zinc borate; both Mn and Dy addition enhanced the degree of crystallization while Eu depressed it. Heat treatment at 650 °C/5 h revealed transparent glass-ceramic (TGC), above this temperature opaque glass-ceramic was appeared. Calculation of optical band gap (Eopt), Urbagh energy (∆E) and refractive index were located in the range: 2.1–2.8 eV, 0.53–0.79 eV and 2.45–2.64 respectively. Lifetime decay was increased by increasing heat treatment temperature; it reaches ~2 h after irradiation at 260 nm for 30 min giving green emission at 558 nm. Visual appearance for the emitting light varies from white, red, yellow to blue color.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1515/mt-2021-2012
Photoluminescence properties of Er3+ and Er3+/Yb3+ doped tellurite glass and glass-ceramics containing Bi2Te4O11 crystals,"© The Royal Society of ChemistryGlass and glass-ceramics containing nanocrystals of Bi2Te4O11 cubic phase co-doped with Er3+ and Yb3+ were prepared by heat treatment of the precursor tellurite glass and investigated for optical applications. Lanthanide doped tellurite glass and glass-ceramics have been extensively investigated because of their optical and photoluminescence performance for technological photonic applications. Er3+ and Er3+/Yb3+ doped TeO2-GeO2-K2O-Bi2O3 tellurite glass compositions were prepared by the conventional melt-quenching method. Photoluminescence results showed the important role played by Yb3+ ions when co-doping with Er3+ ions in comparison with the Er3+ single-doped glass. Due to their larger absorption cross-section, Yb3+ species significantly absorbs 980 nm photons and effectively transfers them to Er3+ ions via a set of mechanisms including ground-state absorption (GSA), excited-state absorption (ESA), and energy transfer upconversion (ETU). Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped sample was chosen for the synthesis of transparent glass-ceramics by controlled heat treatment above Tg for 5 to 120 min. X-ray diffraction patterns, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) from Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped glass-ceramic samples were used to verify the nanocrystal precipitation, crystalline phase, and chemical nature. The structural change resulting from the crystallization of Bi2Te4O11 nanocrystals was evaluated by the Raman shift of the bands between 300-500 cm−1, which are assigned to the formation of Bi-O-Te linkages and the reduction of [TeO3] depolymerized units. The effects of HT time on the glass-ceramic's optical and upconversion photoluminescence properties were studied in the visible range under excitation at 980 nm in terms of the energy transfer mechanisms from Yb3+ to Er3+. Results indicate that Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped tellurite glass and glass-ceramics are potential candidates for photonic applications in lighting, energy conversion, and luminescent solar cell concentrators.",Dalton Transactions,10.13373/j.cnki.cjrm.XY20060042
Identifying delamination in carbon fiber composites based on defect modes in imperfect phononic crystals,"© 2022 Author(s).Delamination is one of the most common types of damage in fiber-reinforced composites. In this paper, borrowing from the concept of defect modes in imperfect phononic crystals, we propose a method for identifying delamination damages in composite materials. Specifically, by periodically arranging concentrated masses on the surface of a finite carbon fiber beam, the carbon fiber beam becomes a phononic crystal, and defect modes in Bragg bandgaps can be observed when there is delamination. With the spectral element method formulation, we show that the frequencies of defect modes are directly related to the length and location of the delamination. By performing algebraic addition and subtraction on the generated defect mode frequencies when applying excitations at the two ends of a defected carbon fiber composite beam, an approximately linear correlation with the length and location of delamination can be obtained. Our analytical and experimental results indicate that, by introducing periodicity on the carbon fiber composite beam and applying appropriate post-processing algorithm to the generated defect modes, rapid and accurate identification of the delamination length and location can be achieved based on the bandgap characteristics of the imperfect phononic crystals.",Journal of Applied Physics,10.1134/S2075113322010270
Hybrid fibroin-nanocellulose composites for the consolidation of aged and historical silk,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Silk artifacts are a valuable artistic and historical heritage, but are prone to degradation that makes the fibers fragile, hindering the preservation of precious collections. Dispersions of self-regenerated silk fibroin (SRSF) can be used to cast films on aged fibers and recover their mechanical properties, but there appears to be a limit to the fibroin concentration in the dispersions, as too concentrated systems produce highly crystalline but mechanically brittle films. Alternatively, we propose here hybrid dispersions of SRSF and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) with the aim to grant the aged fibers improved strength, taking advantage of the SRSF structuration induced by CNC, and of the intrinsic mechanical properties of the cellulose crystals. We demonstrate that CNC speeds up the assembly of fibroin in the hybrid dispersions, leading to the formation of more compact colloidal structures at the nanoscale than the sole SRSF. When the hybrid dispersions film, the presence of CNC favors the formation of crystalline structures (most notably α-helices) even at low fibroin concentration, and the films confer optimal axial strength to aged silk fibers, surpassing the performance of single-component (SRSF or CNC) dispersions at the same concentration of consolidant, and of pure crystalline SRSF. Overall, the hybrid formulations candidate as new sustainable tools for the preservation of historical textiles, employing renewable materials (cellulose and silk scraps) to restore artifacts.",Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects,10.1063/5.0079698

The Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication waiver (http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) applies to the data made available in this article, unless otherwise stated.Aims: The study aims to assess the effect of Arabic Qahwa (AQ) on the color parameters of lithium disilicate glass ceramic (LDGC), IPS e.max computer-aided design (CAD), and multilayered zirconia CAD/ computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) ceramic materials after immersion in AQ and also, to measure the biaxial fracture strength and fracture modes of the tested materials. Materials and methods: Sixty circular specimens were milled from LDGC and zirconia. Before AQ immersion, the color parameters of the specimens L, a, and b were measured and recorded using a spectrophotometer on white, black, and gray background and analyzed after AQ staining and aging for 14 days. Biaxial compressive forces and fracture types were recorded. The collected data were analyzed with SPSS for descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance, and post hoc tests. Results: The overall TP values were 16.79 and 15.85 for LDGC and zirconia, respectively. The recorded ΔE* values were 2.63 and 2.99 for LDGC and zirconia, which have no remarkable difference. The TP values after AQ staining were slightly lesser. Subgroup analysis revealed considerable differences in TP values among zirconia specimens under both backgrounds, whereas substantial differences in ΔE* values were observed between LDGC and zirconia under white background only. Lithium disilicate glass ceramic (LDGC) had higher biaxial fracture forces than zirconia. Reparable, semi-reparable, and non-reparable fractures comprised 60, 30, and 10% of the overall fracture modes, respectively, with significant differences between and within groups (p = 0.034). Conclusion: AQ staining had a marked effect on the TP and ΔE* values of the tested CAD/CAM materials, but the values were within clinically acceptable levels. The optical properties were dependent on the material. Lithium disilicate glass ceramic (LDGC) had higher biaxial fracture forces than zirconia. Reparable fracture was the dominant type among the examined materials. Clinical significance: Glazed surface for any CAD/CAM ceramic prostheses is highly recommended. Both tested materials are strongly recommended to be used for AQ consumers.",Journal of Contemporary Dental Practice,10.3390/polym14040822
Application of machine vision-based NDT technology in ceramic surface defect detection - A review,"© 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.For its good mechanical, thermal, and chemical property, ceramic materials are widely used in construction, chemical industry, electric power, communication and other fields. However, due to its particularity and complex production process, quality problems usually occur, of which the most common one is surface defects. For ceramic products, the defects are usually small and complicated, and manual methods are difficult to ensure the accuracy and speed of detection. Relevant researchers have proposed a variety of machine vision-based ceramic defect detection methods, but these methods still need to break through in solving the key problems of ceramic surface glaze reflection, complex detection environment, low algorithm efficiency and low real-time performance. To this end, this article reviews the application status of machine vision on ceramic surface defect detection in recent years, summarizes and analyzes the existing non-destructive testing (NDT) technology method, and points out the main factors that affect the development of ceramic surfaces defect detection technology and puts forward the corresponding solutions.",Materialpruefung/Materials Testing,10.3390/healthcare10020382
Progress in Application of Anthraquinone Organic Electrode Materials in New Secondary Batteries 蒽醌类有机电极材料在新型二次电池中的应用研究进展,"© Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals. All right reserved.With the rapid development of renewable energy industry, the unstable and unsustainable problems of renewable energy have become increasingly prominent, and efficient energy storage technology has become a research hotspot. The current energy stor-age materials generally used transition metal materials as the electrode of the battery. However, due to the limited reserves, supply shortage and pollution, the development prospects were limited. In recent years, organic electrode materials were increasingly favored by researchers due to their light weight, flexibility, abundant resources and sustainable development. Anthraquinone organic materials were a kind of electrode active materials with low cost and high energy density, which had the advantages of large theoretical specific capacity, high redox activity, strong electrochemical reversibility and designable structure. They showed great potential in energy stor-age. This article reviewed the research progress of anthraquinone organic electrode materials in secondary batteries in recent years. The synthetic methods and electrochemical properties of several typical anthraquinone small molecular compounds, polymers and com-pound(polymer)-composite materials were analyzed, and the partial electrochemical reaction mechanism was summarized. Compared with the traditional inorganic electrode materials involving the deintercalation process of guest cations in the main lattice, and accom-panied by the change of valence state of transition metal cations, anthraquinone organic materials were insensitive to the radius of metal ions and were not easily affected by anti-ions. When the redox potential was 2.27 V(vs. Li+ /Li), the theoretical specific capacity of anthraquinone was 257 mAh•g-1, which had a wide voltage range, high electrochemical reaction activity and strong stability. However, anthraquinone small molecules were easily dissolved in common organic electrolytes. Secondary batteries with anthraquinone as electrode active materials had problems such as easy capacity decay, short battery life, low battery cycle reversibility, and poor rate performance. With the progress of research methods, its electrochemical performance could be adjusted by molecular design. Anthra-quinone organic materials were widely studied as electrode active materials with broad application prospects. The anthraquinone com-pounds with anthraquinone as the center contained two para-carbonyl groups in the unsaturated six-membered ring structure, which could be used as the active center of redox reaction. Since the redox properties of anthraquinone compounds were directly related to their chemical structure, the introduction of substituents(such as-OH, -OLi(Na), -COOLi(Na)and-SO3Na)on the anthraqui-none skeleton could reduce their solubility and increase their specific capacity. The problem of limited actual capacity caused by the high solubility and low conductivity of anthraquinone molecules in aprotic organic electrolytes could be overcome by converting anthra-quinone molecules with substituents into their polymers to improve their comprehensive electrochemical performance. In addition to de-pending on the skeleton structure of polyaniline, different functional groups with conjugated effect with benzene ring could also be in-troduced to participate in the charge-discharge reaction process, thus greatly improving the performance of the material and enhancing its stability. Anthraquinone polymer with stable structure and fast redox kinetics had great potential in achieving high rate performance and cyclic stability. In addition to the above polymerization method, the doping of anthraquinone compounds with conductive sub-strates(such as porous carbon, CNT, graphene, etc.)provided another effective method to reduce the solubility of anthraquinone compounds and enhance their electrical conductivity. Porous conductive substrate had a unique hollow structure, which was conducive to the movement of electrolyte ions. Although the combination of anthraquinone derivatives and conductive substrates provided another option for the preparation of excellent organic materials, how to select the ratio of the two, electrolyte and charge/discharge voltage range to reflect the best performance of the composites remained to be further studied. In general, the formation and transformation of free radical intermediates occurred in the charge-discharge process of anthraquinone organic electrode materials. Free radical interme-diates usually exhibited high reactivity and fast reaction kinetics, which was conducive to improving the capacity and rate performance of materials. However, the high activity unpaired electrons of organic radical intermediates were unstable, which was the main reason for the poor cycle stability of electrode materials. The controllable regulation of the stability of free radical intermediates was of great significance for optimizing the performance of anthraquinone organic electrode materials. The electrode materials based on porous sys-tems such as MOF, CMPs and COF had the synergistic effect of redox active skeleton and large and medium pores. The covalent net-work enhanced the stability of electrode materials, and the open channel promoted the transmission of metal ions, thereby improved the comprehensive electrochemical performance of anthraquinone electrode materials. The structural advantages of anthraquinone po-rous materials proved that they had great development potential in the next generation of energy storage devices. In the future, the fur-ther research directions of anthraquinone organic electrode materials are as follows: by introducing effective active groups, doping car-bon-containing materials, and optimizing the synthetic route, the anthraquinone organic electrode materials with better comprehensive performance are designed by combining experiments with theoretical calculations.",Xiyou Jinshu/Chinese Journal of Rare Metals,10.1002/masy.202100316
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Study of Ice-Based Composite Materials Reinforced with Nanodisperse Aluminum Oxide Fibers,"© 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.Abstract: Pulsed-field gradient NMR spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging methods were used to investigate water suspensions of nanosized fibers of aluminum oxide and ice composite materials based on these fibers. Introduction of the nanofibers was shown to have no noticeable structural effect in the suspensions in the Al2O3 concentration range of 1–10 wt %. High content of the filler was found to change the morphology and texture of the ice matrix in the composites remarkably: it becomes more homogeneous and acquires a higher degree of continuity; the melting front does not visualize internal melting zones or integrity defects in the composite. At the same time, addition of the nanofibers to the ice composites weakly influences the quantitative dynamics of the heat transfer, which is manifested in close values of the propagation speeds of the freezing/melting front in the samples at similar temperatures.",Inorganic Materials: Applied Research,10.3390/cryst12020287
Research on anti-irradiation properties of PDMS/MWCNT composite force-sensitive structure,"© 2022 Author(s).This study aimed to design a polydimethylsiloxane multi-walled carbon nanotube composite force-sensitive structure. Five composite materials with different volume fractions of carbon nanotubes were prepared, and the microscopic morphology of the samples recorded. Conductive pathways were formed inside the composite materials. The force-sensitive performance was verified through tensile experiments on the material. The sample with a content of 3 vol. % had a sensitivity of up to 165, which was good for detecting small strains. The samples were irradiated with 60Co-γrays, and the irradiation doses were 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 kGy. After irradiation with the highest dose of 100 kGy, the sensitivity of the sample with a content of 3 vol. % was reduced to 125. The samples exposed to different irradiation doses were stretched and released 3000 times to verify the repeatability of the force sensitive characteristics; almost no difference was found in the resistance strain results of the sample. Experiments showed that the designed composite force-sensitive structure had high sensitivity, good repeatability, and good resistance to gamma radiation.",AIP Advances,10.3390/nano12040670
An Investigation on Fatigue Resistance of Notched Long Fiber-Reinforced Composite Materials,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A new type of specimen is proposed for further research on the structure of glass-fiber-reinforced resin matrix composite lamina, which holds the potential to significantly improve the fatigue property of materials while having limited effect on the tensile strength. Herein, the fatigue life, based on the monotonic tensile test, was simulated utilizing ANSYS and nCode analysis software. The results show that the tensile strength of the local notched fiber specimens is slightly lower than that of the continuous long-fiber specimens. However, when extending the notches’ longitudinal distance, the impact to tensile strength becomes smaller and smaller. The results show that, when the longitudinal distance of the notched fiber is greater than 80 mm, the reduction in tensile strength is less than 0.65%. At the same time, the fatigue property of the specimens is improved considerably. It has been found in this experiment that when the notches’ longitudinal distance is 100 mm, the notches’ length is 1.5 mm, and the notches’ width is 1.75 mm, the fatigue cycles number of the specimens reaches 126,000 cycles, which is about 180% higher than that of the 0-0 type long fiber specimens without notches. This investigation provides a robust foundation and is a compelling basis for further exploration of new fatigue specimens.",Polymers,10.37188/CJL.20210349

Sinter-Crystallization and Optical Characterization of Dy3+: ZnO-B2O3-RHA Glass-Ceramics,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHIn this current study, the behavior of dysprosium oxide (Dy2O3) doped willemite glass-ceramic (WGC) derived from ZnO-B2O3-RHA: Dy2O3 glasses and rice-husk ash (RHA) works as the active alternative silica has been studied. The fusions of the ternary host system of oxide components doped with rare earth oxide go through the melt-quench technique followed by solid-state sintering on the compacted glass frits. The sintered green samples are characterized utilizing the physical, structural, and optical properties to investigate the effect of different sintering temperatures on the samples accordingly. The bulk density of WGC increases together with the increment of sintering temperature from 2.571 to 2.940 g cm–3. Meanwhile, the increment of sintering temperature escalates the crystallization of the main crystalline phase, Zn2SiO4, corroborated by the enlargement of average crystallite size from 161 to 550 nm. Furthermore, the emission activity in the WGC also intensifies on the green emission region (524 nm) accordingly. This fabricated Dy3+:WGC contributes to the nomination as the potential solid-state lighting material.",Macromolecular Symposia,10.3390/ma15041384
Effect of Gold Nanoparticles on the Crystallization and Optical Properties of Glass in ZnO‐MgO‐Al2O3‐SiO2 System,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Gold nanoparticles precipitated in transparent glass‐ceramics could pave the way for the development of multifunctional materials that are in demand in modern photonics and optics. In this work, we explored the effect of gold nanoparticles on the crystallization, microstructure, and optical properties of ZnO‐MgO‐Al2O3‐SiO2 glass containing TiO2 and ZrO2 as nucleating agents. X‐ ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman, and optical spectroscopy were used for the study. We showed that gold nanoparticles have no effect on the formation of gahnite nanocrystals during the glass heat treatments, while optical properties of the glass‐ceramics are strongly dependent on the gold addition. A computational model was developed to predict optical properties of glass during the crystallization, and the possibility for adjusting the localized surface plasmon resonance band position with the heat treatment temperature was shown.",Crystals,10.3390/biomedicines10020395
The Influence of Argon Cluster Ion Bombardment on the Characteristics of AlN Films on Glass-Ceramics and Si Substrates,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In this paper, the influence of surface modification on the characteristics and properties of AlN thin films on Si and glass-ceramics substrates is investigated. The surface modification was made at various parameters of argon cluster ions. By using XRD and Raman spectroscopy, it was shown that the obtained AlN films have a hexagonal structure with a characteristic direction of texturing along the c axis and slight deviations from it. A comparison of the AlN surface morphology obtained by atomic force microscopy before and after cluster processing was demonstrated. This demonstrated that the cluster ions with low energy per atom (E/N = 10 eV/atom) have a high efficiency of surface smoothing. A decrease in the intensity of the Raman peaks and an increase in their full-width after bombardment with cluster ions were found, which may be caused by a change in the physicochemical state of the surface. The optical properties, the quality of the boundaries, and the distribution map of the thickness of the functional layer of AlN were investigated by the methods of spectral and spatial resolution ellipsometry. By using the cross-sectional SEM, the direction of crystallite texturing was demonstrated. The influence of argon cluster ion bombardment on the stoichiometry of samples was analyzed by EDX spectroscopy. The results obtained demonstrate the efficiency of the cluster ion smoothing of polycrystalline thin films for microelectronics, particularly when creating surface acoustic wave resonators.",Nanomaterials,10.3390/ma15031245
Elaboration and Mid-infrared Emission of KYb3F10: Er3+ Nanocrystals Embedded in Glass Ceramics KYb3F10: Er3+纳米复合微晶玻璃制备与中红外发光特性,"© 2022, Science Press. All right reserved.Mid-infrared lasers operating at around 3 μm have been paid much attention due to their significant potential at civil and military field. Traditional mid-infrared laser glass matrix presents high phonon energy, which causes the radiative transition probability of luminescent ions being greatly weakened, and thus leads to the inability to obtain effective laser output. Therefore, it is of great value to explore efficient and stable gain materials for 3 μm laser. In this paper, we report the in-situ precipitation of KYb3F10: Er3+ nanocrystals from SiO2-ZnF2-KF-YbF3-ErF3 fluorosilicate glass matrix. The obtained glass ceramic can maintain more than 80% transmittance. The nanocrystal species and elemental distribution in the glass were characterized by X-ray diffractometry(XRD) and transmission electron microscopy(TEM) technology. Under 980 nm laser diode(LD) excitation, the mid-infrared emission at 2.7 μm of Er3+for the heat-treated sample is greatly enhanced, which is about 19 times stronger than that of the precursor sample. The related mechanism for the luminescence enhancement is further explained by the results of absorption spectra and steady state fluorescence spectra. The present results may provide reference data and research ideas for the development of ~3 μm laser gain materials.",Faguang Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Luminescence,10.3390/nano12040639
There is still plenty of room for layer-by-layer assembly for constructing nanoarchitectonics-based materials and devices,"© the Owner Societies.Nanoarchitectonics approaches can produce functional materials from tiny units through combination of various processes including atom/molecular manipulation, chemical conversion, self-assembly/self-organization, microfabrication, and bio-inspired procedures. Existing fabrication approaches can be regarded as fitting into the same concept. In particular, the so-called layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly method has huge potential for preparing applicable materials with a great variety of assembling mechanisms. LbL assembly is a multistep process where different components can be organized in planned sequences while simple alignment options provide access to superstructures, for example helical structures, and anisotropies which are important aspects of nanoarchitectonics. In this article, newly-featured examples are extracted from the literature on LbL assembly discussing trends for composite functional materials according to (i) principles and techniques, (ii) composite materials, and (iii) applications. We present our opinion on the present trends, and the prospects of LbL assembly. While this method has already reached a certain maturity, there is still plenty of room for expanding its usefulness for the fabrication of nanoarchitectonics-based materials and devices.

Preparation and Characterization of Glass-Ceramic Foam from Clay-Rich Waste Diatomaceous Earth,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In this study, the potential use of waste diatomaceous earth from the production of di-atomaceous earth for filtration purposes, as an alternative raw material for foam glass production, was explored. The chemical and mineralogical composition and the high temperature behavior of waste diatomite were studied to assess its suitability for foam glass production. Glass-ceramic foams were prepared using NaOH solution as a foaming agent, via a hydrate mechanism. The influence of different pretreatments and firing temperatures on the foam’s structure, bulk density and compressive strength was investigated. High temperature behavior was studied using TG/DTA analysis and high temperature microscopy. Phase composition was studied using X-ray diffraction analysis. Glass-ceramic foam samples of a high porosity comparable to conventional foam glass products were fabricated. The pretreatment temperature, foaming temperature and sintering holding time were found to have a significant influence on foam properties. With increased pretreatment temperature, pyrogenic carbon from the thermal decomposition of organic matter contained in the raw material acted as an additional foaming agent and remained partially unoxidized in prepared foams. The bulk densities of prepared samples ranged from 150 kg/m3 to 510 kg/m3 and their compressive strengths were between 140 and 1270 kPa.",Materials,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.10.101
Ceramic Stereolithography of Bioactive Glasses: Influence of Resin Composition on Curing Behavior and Green Body Properties,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Herein we report on the preparation of a bioactive glass (BAG)-based photocurable resin for the additive manufacturing of BAG scaffolds with high filler loadings. The preparation of glass/ceramics resins for stereolithography with high filler loading is always a challenge, especially for fillers with a high refractive index variance. Various photocurable resin compositions with and without bioactive glass fillers have been investigated to see the influence of bioactive glass on physical properties of the resin and resulting green body. The effect of concentration of monomers, reactive diluent, light absorber (Sudan orange G dye), photoinitiator (PI), non-reactive diluent, and fillers (BAG) on rheology and photocuring behavior of the resin and tomography of the resulting 3D structures have been investigated. The BAG contents affect the rheology of resin and influence the rate of the polymerization reaction. The resin compositions with 55–60% BAG, 10% PEG-200 (diluent), 1% of PI and 0.015% of the dye were found to be suitable compositions for the stereolithographic fabrication. A higher percentage of PI caused over-curing, while a higher amount of dye decreased the cure depth of the resin. The micro-computed tomography (µ-CT) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of the resulting green bodies display a relatively dense glass scaffold without any visible cracks and good interlayer connection and surface finishing. These properties play an important role in the mechanical behavior of 3D scaffolds. This study will be helpful to prepare high density glass/ceramic slurries and optimize their printing properties.",Biomedicines,10.3390/membranes12020167
Bracket Bonding to All-Ceramic Materials with Universal Adhesives,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The need for bracket bonding to ceramic restorations is increasing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of universal adhesives on bracket adhesion to polished or glazed lithium disilicate (LDS) and monolithic zirconia (MZ) surfaces. One hundred and twenty brackets (N = 10) were bonded to either polished or glazed LDS (e.max CAD B32, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) and MZ (In-Ceram® YZ, VITA, Bad Sackingen, Germany) blocks using three different adhesives combined with Transbond™ XT Paste (3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA). Tested universal adhesives were Scotchbond™ Universal Adhesive (SU, 3M St. Paul, MN, USA) and Assure Plus (AP, Reliance, Itasca, IL, USA). Transbond™ XT Primer (XTP, 3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA) served as a control adhesive. Bracket bond strength was measured in shear mode (SBS). Failure type was determined by the Modified Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI). Data were statistically analyzed. On polished LDS, SU yielded bracket SBS significantly superior to those of AP and XTP. On polished MZ, the use of SU and AP significantly enhanced bracket retention as compared with XTP. Low SBS values, below the threshold of clinical acceptability, were reached by all tested adhesives on glazed LDS and MZ specimens. SBS measurements corresponded with failure type observations. Universal adhesives SU and AP could be considered for use on polished LDS and MZ surfaces.",Materials,10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.109849
Electrical Transport in Iron Phosphate-Based Glass-(Ceramics): Insights into the Role of B2O3 and HfO2 from Model-Free Scaling Procedures,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In this work, we report the effect of the addition of modifiers and network formers on the polaronic transport in iron phosphate glasses (IPG) in two systems of HfO2–B2O3–Fe2O3–P2O5, to which up to 8 mol% boron and hafnium are added. The addition of oxides significantly changes the Fe2+ /Fetotal ratio, thus directly affecting the polaron number density and consequently controlling DC conductivity trends for both series studied by impedance spectroscopy. Moreover, we found that short-range polaron dynamics are also under the influence of structural changes. Therefore, we have studied them in detail using model-free scaling procedures, Summerfield and Sidebottom scaling. An attempt to construct a super-master curve revealed that in addition to change in polaron number density, also the polaron hopping lengths change, and Sidebottom scaling yields a super-master curve. The spatial extent of the localized motion of polarons is correlated with polaron number density and two distinct regions are observed. A strong increase in the spatial extent of the polaron hopping jump could be related either to the structural changes due to the addition of HfO2 and B2O3 and their effects on the formation of polarons or to an inherent property of polaron transport in IP glasses with low polaron number density.",Nanomaterials,10.3390/ma15031104
Approximate field measures for ionic polymer-metal composite materials and a simplified order-of-magnitude actuator model,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.As the field of soft robotics grows and new applications for this technology are discovered, the use of simplified models for the soft actuators found in these devices will be critical. In this study we explore arguments based on the magnitude of field gradients that arise in the ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) under large applied voltages and their use for approximating measures of the fields inside the polymer. Using the order-of-magnitude based arguments provides exceptional results for quantifying the field measures of maximum ionic concentration and electric potential within the bulk of the polymer. These measures are leveraged to reconstruct the fields themselves in such a way that the internal bending moments generated inside the actuator may be approximated. With the internal moments, a simplified kinematic model may be used to formulate the steady-state actuator response of the IPMC. This actuator model shows a great deal of accuracy as compared to a full multiphysics model, and we discuss the prospects for future development of this model to account for dynamic actuation.",Smart Materials and Structures,10.3390/en15030893
Near infrared persistent luminescence of transparent Zn-Ga-Ge-O:Cr3+ glass ceramic for optical information storage,"© 2021Cr3+-doped near-infrared (NIR) afterglow phosphors have received wide recognition in the optical storage field because of the high signal-to-noise ratio and broad excitation spectra. In this article, the high-temperature TL intensity of ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ afterglow glass ceramic (ZGO:Cr3+ GC) was enhanced via partial hetero-valence substitution of Ge for Ga, demonstrating the tunability of the trapped electron levels in ZGO:Cr3+ GC. The persistent luminescence phosphor ZGO:Cr3+ GC exhibits a zero-phonon lines emission peaking at 698 nm, attributing to the 2E→4A2g transition of Cr3+ ions. Moreover, the trap levels in Zn-Ga-Ge-O:Cr3+ glass ceramic (ZGGO:Cr3+ GC) are deeper than those of the Ge-free one and the captured electrons in deeper levels cannot be released only by the ambient thermal energy, thus the optical storage capacity of ZGGO:Cr3+ GC is much larger. By means of an additional 980 nm laser photostimulation, an intense NIR emission could be obtained. In consequence, ZGGO:Cr3+ GC has a promising application prospect in optical information storage field.",Ceramics International,10.1007/s10854-021-07521-x
Development of a Membrane Module Prototype for Oxygen Separation in Industrial Applications,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The integration of oxygen transport membranes in industrial processes can lead to energy and economic advantages, but proof of concept membrane modules are highly necessary to demon-strate the feasibility of this technology. In this work, we describe the development of a lab-scale module through a comprehensive study that takes into consideration all the relevant technological aspects to achieve a prototype ready to be operated in industrial environment. We employed scalable techniques to manufacture planar La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ membrane components suitable for the application in both 3-and 4-end mode, designed with a geometry that guarantees a failure proba-bility under real operating conditions as low as 2.2 × 10−6 . The asymmetric membranes that act as separation layers showed a permeation of approx. 3 NmL/min/cm2 at 900◦C in air/He gradient, with a remarkable stability up to 720 h, and we used permeation results to develop a CFD model that describes the influence of the working conditions on the module performance. The housing of the membrane component is an Inconel 625 case joined to the membrane component by means of a custom-developed glass–ceramic sealant that exhibited a remarkable thermo-chemical compatibility both with metal and ceramic, despite the appearance of chemical strain in LSCF at high temperature. The multi-disciplinary approach followed in this work is suitable to be adapted to other module concepts based on membrane components with different dimensions, layouts or materials.",Membranes,10.1007/s00707-021-03113-2
Solvent-free rapid degradation of epoxy composites and recycling application of high performance carbon fibers through the synergic catalysis effect of molten salts and titanium dioxide,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdAlong with the massive application of the carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), the quantity of CFRP wastes are rapidly increasing, becoming an urgent issue to be resolved. Here, an effective solvent-free treatment method was proposed to recycle carbon fiber/epoxy composite wastes and reclaim the carbon fibers with high performance. The resin matrix composed of tetra-functional epoxy/aromatic amine system which is widely used in aircraft components can be decomposed rapidly in KCl/ZnCl2 molten salts due to triggered C-N bond cleavage under the catalytic effect of cations at 350 °C in 90 min, and TiO2 can facilitate the removal of pyrolysis carbon within 10 min subsequently. In addition, the reclaimed fibers had similar chemical structure and graphitization degree to the commercial fibers, and also the tensile strength retention rate was up to 97.8%. The reclaimed carbon fibers showed a comparable reinforcing effect for the polypropylene in comparison to the commercial fibers, without visible influence on processability, thermal stability and crystallization behavior of matrix, showing valuable application potential in the field of composite materials. Therefore, this study devised a novel high-efficiency technique applicable for industry to reclaim high-performance carbon fibers from epoxy composite wastes under a mild condition, which showed a significant application value in term of the environmental protection and sustainable development.",Polymer Degradation and Stability,10.3390/ma15030756
"Influence of R=Y, Gd, Sm on Crystallization and Sodium Ion Conductivity of Na5RSi4O12 Phase","© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.New sodium-based battery concepts require solid electrolytes as ion conducting separators. Besides NaSICON and β-Al2O3 in the Na2O-R2O3-SiO2 system (R = rare earth), a rarely noticed glass-ceramic solid electrolyte with the composition Na5RSi4O12 (N5-type) exists. The present study addresses the investigation of the ionic conductivity of Na5RSi4O12 solid electrolytes sintered from pre-crystallized glass-ceramic powders. The sintering behavior (optical dilatometry), the microstructure (SEM/EDX), and phase composition (XRD), as well as electrochemical properties (impedance spectroscopy), were investigated. To evaluate the effect of the ionic radii, Y, Sm and Gd rare elements were chosen. All compositions were successfully synthesized to fully densified compacts having the corresponding conducting N5-type phase as the main component. The densification behavior was in agreement with the melting point, which decreased with increasing ionic radii and specific cell volume. Alternatively, the ionic conductivities of N5-phases decreased from Y to Gd and Sm containing samples. The highest ionic conductivity of 1.82·10−3 S cm−1 at 20 °C was obtained for Na5YSi4O12 composition. The impact of grain boundaries and bulk conductivity on measured values is discussed. A powder-based synthesis method of this glass-ceramic solid electrolyte using different rare earth elements opens possibilities for optimizing ionic conductivity and scalable technological processing by tape casting.",Materials,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.121317
Enhancing Efficiency of Industrial Centrifugal Fans Using Blade Adjustment Mechanism,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The paper presents research on increasing the efficiency of industrial centrifugal fans, which are the third highest energy-consuming group of devices. This problem is related to the frequent incompatibility of the fan characteristics with the flow conditions of the installation in which they are operated, which lowers efficiency and increases energy consumption. By ensuring high efficiency of these devices, it is possible to significantly reduce the operating costs of such industrial equipment. For this purpose, a unique concept of regulating the flow parameters of centrifugal fans was developed. The scientific basis of this idea is that a relatively small change in the impeller diameter of the fan significantly affects the flow rate and the pressure rise of the fan. Therefore, the idea uses variable length of the impeller blades by dividing them into a fixed and a movable part. It enables adjustment of the length of the blades, which allows extension of the range of effective and efficient operating parameters. On this basis, several technical solutions of the regulation system were developed, which were then tested using simulation and analytical methods. Two material options for the moving part of the blade have also been developed, one made of metallic materials (high-strength steel and aluminum) and the other made of composite materials. The research showed a significant influence of the mass of the movable part of the blade on the load of the control system. Therefore, ultra-light material variants were used for the impeller blades. The flow simulation tests of the new method of adjusting the fan flow parameters confirmed the effectiveness of this solution. As a result, a wider range of highly efficient centrifugal fans equipped with such a control system was obtained.",Energies,10.1007/s10854-021-07487-w
"Influence of R2+ (R = Mg, Ca, Sr) partial substitution for Ba2+ on structures and the thermal properties of BaO–Al2O3–SiO2–B2O3 LTCC materials","© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.A combination of dielectric and thermal properties is the prime factor for developing glass–ceramics for practical aspects in low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology. In this work, we report the low melting-point compositions of BaO–Al2O3–SiO2–B2O3 and BaAl2Si2O8 ceramics at 900 °C. The phase evolutions, microstructure, dielectric, and thermal expansion properties corresponding to the partial replacement of Ba2+ with alkaline earth metal ions R2+, i.e., Sr2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were investigated. The results indicated that, because the lattice distortion of hexacelsian structure was caused by solid solutions of substitution ions to BaAl2Si2O8 ceramics, the phase transition of hexacelsian can be gradually inhabited with the decrease of the substitution ion radius. Notably, the partial substitution of Mg2+ in the Ba2+ can completely inhibit the phase transition and promote the formation of orthorhombic celsian. By the substitution of 40 mol% of Ba2+ to Mg2+, physical properties, i.e., density of 2.22 g⋅cm−3, εr of 4.08 at 12 GHz, and tanδ of 2.7 × 10−3, are obtained. Importantly, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of 4.02 × 10−6/°C close to that of monocrystalline silicon is also successfully achieved. The new BaAl2Si2O8 ceramics with low CTE and reliable thermal stability demonstrated the potential for application in chip packaging.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,10.1016/j.dental.2021.12.018
Residual stresses near the free edge of composite materials,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.The accumulation of residual stresses during the manufacturing of a carbon-epoxy composite induces defects such as interlayer delamination and the formation of microcracks in the matrix. In the present study, the effect of the polymerization process in the thermoset matrix of the laminated composite plate on the stress state near the free edge is investigated. To estimate the residual stresses in the laminate, the simulation of the curing process was accomplished using coupled thermal and structural analysis. The proposed approach was implemented in ABAQUS software via a special user subroutine, and the validation problem of plate distortion after the curing is presented. The modeling of the cut process was performed, which corresponds to the plate machining, for the analysis of the residual stress re-distribution after the cut with formation of a free edge. In addition, the manufacturing process of the laminate with the initial crack was simulated for the analysis of crack growth caused by residual stresses. Finally, the modeling of uniaxial load to the laminate up to failure with the presence of residual stresses and consideration of a crack in the vicinity of the free edge is presented.",Acta Mechanica,10.1016/j.polymer.2021.124492

Elaboration and luminescence of cerium-doped lutetium silicate glass-ceramics via in-situ growth from containerless processed lutetium silicate glass,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Amorphous cerium-doped lutetium silicate scintillator was fabricated through aerodynamic levitation method. The lutetium silicate glass scintillator transformed into glass-ceramics after annealing at 950 °C in air. The crystalline phase of the glass-ceramics was composed with lutetium oxyorthosilicate (Lu2SiO5:Ce, LSO:Ce) and lutetium pyrosilicate (Lu2Si2O7:Ce, LPS:Ce). The crystalline parts of the glass-ceramics, i.e., the micro-sized polycrystalline LPS/LSO particles, consist of nano-sized LPS and LSO grains. The in-line transmittance of the LPS/LSO:Ce glass and glass-ceramics are 86% at 600 nm. The luminescence characteristics of the highly transparent LPS/LSO:Ce glass and glass-ceramics were investigated through Photoluminescence (PL), Photoluminescence Excitation (PLE) and Cathodoluminescence (CL). It suggests that combination of containerless processing and in-situ growth of lutetium silicate from glass matrix is a promising route to fabricate highly transparent lutetium silicate scintillators.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1002/smtd.202101395
"Effect of BaO on crystallization, sintering, and properties of MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 glass–ceramics","© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The effect of BaO on the crystallization, sintering, and properties of MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 glass–ceramics was investigated. The sintering kinetics suggested that doping BaO decreased the sintering activation energy and thus enhanced the densification of MAS glass–ceramics. DSC demonstrated that BaO increased the crystallization temperature of indialite and inhibited the precipitation of indialite. XRD indicated that the addition of BaO promoted the formation of (MgAl2Si3O10)0.6 and even stabilized the existence of (MgAl2Si3O10)0.6 phase. The precipitation of (MgAl2Si3O10)0.6 with high thermal expansion coefficient increased the internal stress and the mosaic structure of co-existed indialite and (MgAl2Si3O10)0.6 markedly improved mechanical properties. MAS glass–ceramics with 3 wt% BaO sintered at 950 °C showed good properties: εr = 6.01, tanδ = 2.5 × 10–3, σ = 310 MPa, φ = 109.3 GPa, and α = 4.52 × 10–6/°C.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230890
Influence of ceramic-coating techniques on composite-zirconia bonding: Strain energy release rate evaluation,"© 2021 The Academy of Dental MaterialsObjectives: To compare ceramic-coating techniques versus conventional techniques on bonding between composite cements and zirconia by means of strain energy release rate (Gc, J/m2). Methods: Two sizes of zirconia bars (30 mm × 8 mm × 1.5 mm and 14.8 mm × 8 mm × 1.5 mm) were fabricated. Two smaller bars were treated and cemented to the surface of a large bar using one of the following methods: (i) AlN-nano-structured alumina coating with RelyX Unicem 2; (ii) HOT-DCM hotbond coating with G-Multi Primer and G-Cem Linkforce; (iii) LiDi-lithium disilicate glass-ceramic coating with Monobond N Primer and Multilink Speed; (iv) COJ-tribochemical silica treatment with RelyX Ceramic Primer and RelyX Unicem 2; (v) GCEM-alumina grit blasting with G-Multi Primer and G-Cem LinkForce; (vi) MUL-alumina grit blasting with Multilink Speed; and (vii) PAN-alumina grit blasting with Clearfil Ceramic Primer and Panavia F2.0. A total of 30 bilayered specimens in each group were stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 h and assigned to three subgroups (n = 10/test group): short-term test, thermocycling for 5000 cycles, and thermocycling for 10,000 cycles and tested in 4-point bending configuration. Results were analysed using two-way ANOVA, followed by one-way ANOVA and Games-Howell (α = 0.05). Failure mode and surfaces were analysed using optical microscopy and SEM. Results: The bonding (J/m2) of COJ and MUL groups was significantly higher than the other groups among all aging conditions. Thermocycling affected the bonding in COJ and GCEM groups. Significance: Surface pre-treatments and artificial aging affect the bonding between composite cements and zirconia.",Dental Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.105037
Poly(N-methylaniline)/magnetite microsphere and its electrical and magnetic dual responses,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdDual electric/magnetic field-responsive magnetite coated poly(N-methylaniline)/magnetite (PNMA/Fe3O4) microspheres were synthesized via a straightforward synthetic route of chemical oxidative polymerization for monodispersed PNMA microspheres and chemical co-precipitation of Fe3O4 onto the PNMA surface. Along with their chemical and physical characterizations such as morphology, size, and crystalline structure, the electrical conductivity, magnetic properties, and dielectric properties were investigated using a low resistivity meter, vibrating sample magnetometry, and an LCR meter, respectively. All tests and analyses on the particles have proved that they have been successfully synthesized and have good magnetic saturation and dielectric properties. Studies have shown that PNMA had an appropriate conductivity so that these particles do not need for de-doping for electrorheological (ER) test. On the other hand, as a superior soft magnetic material, Fe3O4 has a good magnetic susceptibility for magnetorheological (MR) performance. The synthesized PNMA/Fe3O4 microspheres were adopted in both ER and MR fluids. The suspension made of the PNMA/Fe3O4 particles with a volume fraction of 10 vol% showed a good dual ER and MR response via a rotational rheometer. It is also found that the yield stress of ER and MR fluids followed a power-law behavior under electric/magnetic field strength with their slopes of 1.5 and 1.0, respectively. Thus, the synergistic effects of Fe3O4 and PNMA with both electrical and magnetic behaviors demonstrate their suspension possessing both ER/MR characteristics, widening their potential engineering applications.",Polymer,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.105036
Grasping the Lithium hype: Insights into modern dental Lithium Silicate glass-ceramics,"© 2021 The Academy of Dental MaterialsObjectives: Lithium-based glass-ceramics are currently dominating the landscape of dental restorative ceramic materials, with new products taking the market by storm in the last years. Though, the difference among all these new and old products is not readily accessible for the practitioner, who faces the dilemma of reaching a blind choice or trusting manufacturers’ marketing brochures. To add confusion, new compositions tend to wear material terminologies inherited from vanguard dental lithium disilicates, disregarding accuracy. Here we aim to characterize such materials for their microstructure, crystalline fraction, glass chemistry and mechanical properties. Methods: Eleven commercial dental lithium-based glass ceramics were evaluated: IPS e.max® CAD, IPS e.max® Press, Celtra® Duo, Suprinity® PC, Initial™ LiSi Press, Initial™ LiSi Block, Amber® Mill, Amber® Press, N!CE®, Obsidian® and CEREC Tessera™. The chemical composition of their base glasses was measured by X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (XRF) and Inductive Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES), as well as the composition of their residual glass by subtracting the oxides bound in the crystallized fraction, characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld refinement, and quantified accurately using the G-factor method (QXRD). The crystallization behavior is revealed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves. Elastic constants are provided from Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) and the fracture toughness measured by the Ball-on-Three-Balls method (B3B- K Ic). The microstructure is revealed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Results: The base glasses showed a wide range of SiO2 /Li2O ratios, from 1.5 to 3.0, with the degree of depolymerization dropping from ½ to 2/3 of the initial connectivity. Materials contained Li2SiO3+Li3PO4, Li2SiO3+Li3PO4+Li2Si2O5, Li2Si2O5+Li3PO4+ Cristobalite and/or Quartz and Li2Si2O5+Li3 PO4+LiAlSi2O6, in crystallinity degrees from 45 to 80 vol%. Crystalline phases could be traced to their crystallization peaks on the DSC curves. Pressable materials and IPS e.max® CAD were the only material showing micrometric phases, with N!CE® and Initial™ LiSi Block showing solely nanometric crystals, with the rest presenting a mixture of submicrometric and nanometric particles. Fracture toughness from 1.45 to 2.30 MPa√m were measured, with the linear correlation to crystalline fraction breaking down for submicrometric and nanometric crystal phases. Significance: Dental lithium-based silicate glass-ceramics cannot be all put in the same bag, as differences exist in chemical composition, microstructure, crystallinity and mechanical properties. Pressable materials still perform better mechanically than CAM/CAM blocks, which loose resistance to fracture when crystal phases enter the submicrometric and nanometric range",Dental Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.105032

Unraveling the crystallinity on battery performances of chlorine-rich argyrodite electrolytes,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Chlorine-rich argyrodite Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 presents great potential for the application of solid-state batteries (SSBs) due to the high ionic conductivity and relatively low cost. However, the effect of crystallinity for Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 on the electrochemical performances of related solid-state batteries is unclear. Herein, the electrochemical performances of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2/SE/Li–In SSBs with crystalline and glass-ceramic Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 (c- and gc-LPSC) electrolytes are carefully investigated. Electrochemical tests show that SSBs using c-LPSC electrolytes deliver higher capacities and better rate performances than that of gc-LPSC electrolytes at different operating temperatures due to the higher Li-ion conductivity of the former. Moreover, the optimized solid-state battery delivers an initial discharge capacity of 120.2 mAhg-1 at 5C and maintains 64% of the capacity after 3500 cycles under room temperature. At an elevated temperature (60 °C), a much higher discharge capacity of 145.5 mAh g-1 is achieved and 80.8% of the capacity is sustained after 500 cycles. This work unravels the influence of the crystallinity of argyrodite electrolytes on the intrinsic properties, providing a guiding significance for the construction of high-performance solid-state batteries.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.114314
Improving early running-in wear characteristics for dental lithium disilicate glass-ceramics by ion-exchange,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdObjectives: This study examined the effects of Li+→Na+ ion-exchange on the early wear performance of dental lithium disilicate (LD) glass-ceramics. Methods: Specimens with different shapes were prepared using IPS e.max Press as the LD glass-ceramics. Ion-exchange was conducted by placing polished specimens in molten salt containing 25% NaNO3 and 75% KNO3 at 385 °C for 16 or 64 h. The ion-exchanged specimens were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to investigate the structure and the elemental distribution. Thereafter, the specimens were tested for flexural strength, Vickers hardness, and fracture resistance. A portion of the specimens were tested with a pin-on-disk tribometer with 10 N for 40 × 104 wear cycles in artificial saliva. Wear analysis of the specimens was performed using a 3D profilometer and analyzed with one-way analyses of variance and Tukey's post hoc pairwise comparisons. Worn surfaces were examined with scanning electron microscopy. Results: The LD glass-ceramics exhibited strong time-dependent wear behavior, with typical running-in and steady wear stages. Ion-exchange treatments at 385 °C for 16 h and 64 h both enhanced the mechanical properties and decreased the wear rates of early running-in wear stage. The early wear performance of specimens treated with ion-exchange for long time (64 h) was improved significantly. Conclusion: A thicker ion-exchange layer may be obtained by processing ion-exchange for a long time. This protocol improves the early wear performance of the glass-ceramics effectively. Clinical significance: Dental restorations may fail prematurely due to excessive wear. It is important to improve the early wear performance of the glass-ceramics. Ion-exchange has the potential to strengthen dental LD glass-ceramics. Understanding the effect of ion-exchange on the early wear performance of glass-ceramics provides insight improving the early wear performance of these restorations.",Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104987
Effect of Li+/Na+ exchange on mechanical behavior and biological activity of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdLithium disilicate (LD) glass-ceramics with a stoichiometric composition were ion-exchanged in pure NaNO3 or mixed NaNO3 + KNO3 molten salt baths below the glass transition temperature (Tg). The microstructures, surface morphologies, mechanical properties and bioactivities of the ion-exchanged glass-ceramics were studied in detail. It was found that the strength and toughness of LD glass-ceramic could be enhanced from 175 MPa to 0.96 MPa m1/2 before ion-exchange to 546 MPa and 4.31 MPa m1/2 respectively under a lowered ion-exchange temperature because the less stress relaxation. In addition, a gradient of Na+ rich layer in the surface of glass-ceramic was induced by Li+/Na+ exchange, which could be beneficial to the formation of HA (Hydroxyapatite) with nano-size porous after soaking in SBF (Simulated Body Fluid) solution and exhibited better bioactivity compared with the original LD glass-ceramic. The results might provide a reference for the strengthening and biological activation of LD glass-ceramics in bone restoration applications.",Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104989
Sol-gel preparation of ZrO2–Li2Si2O5 ceramics and their sintering properties,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdDespite zirconia (ZrO2) ceramics and lithium disilicate (Li2Si2O5) glass-ceramics have been widely applied on the market for dental restorations, composites that can combine the advantages of both are still demanded. Here we introduced a ZrO2–Li2Si2O5 ceramic with minimized glass phases that fabricated through a sol-gel method and subsequent pressureless sintering. ZrO2–Li2Si2O5 powders were obtained after the gel precursors were heat treated under 800 °C. The gel-derived powders were molded and pressureless sintered under 900–1000 °C to investigate their sintering properties. From the microstructures of the sintered samples, we knew that the densification process was dominated by the growth of Li2Si2O5 grains instead of the growth of ZrO2 grains. Increasing in Li2Si2O5 content can promote ceramic densification. Interestingly, reactions between ZrO2 and Li2Si2O5 were observed with sintering temperature higher than 916 °C, which can increase the porosity of the ceramics. Therefore, both the content of Li2Si2O5 and sintering temperature should be well adjusted to achieve samples with desired properties. Finally, ceramics with flexural strength of 226 MPa and porosity of 0.4% were achieved from powders with moderate Li2Si2O5 content after sintering at 1000 °C.",Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.hydromet.2021.105781
Effect of processing methods on the chipping resistance of veneered zirconia,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdObjectives: To evaluate the edge chipping resistance (ReA) and the fracture toughness (KC) of 3Y-TZP bilayers produced with the following materials/processing combinations: fluorapatite glass-ceramic applied on zirconia using the traditional layering and hot-pressing (press-on) techniques; feldspathic porcelain using rapid layer technology (RLT); and lithium disilicate glass-ceramic using CAD-on method. The influence of the cooling rate (slow and fast) was analyzed for layering and hot-pressing. Methods: Bilayer bars (25x4x2 mm) were made following manufacturers' instructions. The edge chipping test was performed in an universal testing machine, using a coupled Vickers indenter. ReA was calculated dividing the critical load at fracture by the edge distance. Fracture toughness was calculated by a regression fit with a fixed slope of 1.5 correlating the critical chipping load regarding edge distance and also with indentation fracture (IF) method. Data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test (α = 5%). Results: ReA and KC was significantly higher for the CAD-on bilayers. RLT showed intermediate ReA means, and layering and hot-pressing techniques showed the lowest ReA values. For both processing methods there was no effect of the cooling protocol on the ReA and fracture toughness. Conclusions: There is a significant effect of the material/processing association on the edge chipping resistance and fracture toughness of the bilayers. There was no effect of the cooling protocol on the edge chipping resistance and fracture toughness for the specimens processed by both the layering and hot-pressing techniques.",Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0004078
TiO2/nanocellulose hybrids as functional additives for advanced polypropylene nanocomposites,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Polymer composite materials with renewable fillers offering multiple functions, including good mechanical, photocatalytic and antibacterial properties, increased temperature and UV resistance, and enhanced gas barrier properties, are urgently needed in packaging production. The present research concerns a simple and inexpensive mechanochemical fabrication of TiO2/nanocellulose hybrids, where nanocellulose was obtained by enzymatic reactions. The effect of the weight ratio of components (TiO2 and nanocellulose) on the physicochemical and functional properties of the final products was examined. The obtained TiO2/nanocellulose hybrids were tested to determine dispersion, morphological and thermal properties. Composites of polypropylene with TiO2/nanocellulose hybrids were produced by a two-stage extrusion process. These composite materials, not previously reported in the literature, were subjected to detailed structural research using the X-ray diffraction method, analysis of phase transition using differential scanning calorimetry, analysis of nucleation and crystallization processes, as well as testing of mechanical properties. The composites with hybrid fillers produced very high values of tensile strength (approx. 55 MPa) and higher values of Young's modulus (approx. 1700–1800 MPa). Moreover, these unique composites with TiO2/nanocellulose fillers also exhibited very good nucleating properties, including an increase in the crystallization temperature by 5–8 °C, a reduction of half-times of crystallization by approx. 40%, and high nucleation activity and thermal resistance. It was proven that all of the listed important properties of the composite materials strictly depend on the polymorphic structure, chemical composition, and dispersion and morphological properties of TiO2/nanocellulose hybrid fillers. In this work we describe for the first time a method of obtaining innovative polymer composites with TiO2/nanocellulose hybrid fillers, exhibiting properties that indicate a huge potential for application in many industries.",Industrial Crops and Products,10.1007/s11581-021-04373-7
Evaluation of the damping capacity of common CAD/CAM restorative materials,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdObjectives: To evaluate and quantify the damping capacities of common CAD/CAM restorative materials (CRMs) and to assess their energy dissipation abilities by comparing loss tangent and Leeb hardness data. Methods: Leeb hardness (HLD), together with its deduced energy dissipation data (HLDdis), and loss tangent values recorded via dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) were determined for 4 ceramic, 13 composite, and 2 polymer-based CRMs as well as 1 metal. For Leeb hardness, ten indentations per material were performed on two separate specimens (12.0 × 12.0 × 3.5 mm3) after water storage (24 h; 37.0 ± 1.0 °C). For DMA, ten specimens (16.00 × 4.00 × 1.00 mm3 ± 0.05 mm) per material were investigated in distilled water (37.0 ± 0.5 °C) with a dynamic force of 1 N at 1.5 Hz. Each data set was analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with material type and material nested in material type as factors. Post-ANOVA contrasts were performed using a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons (α = 0.05). Correlations between different parameters were tested (Pearson, α = 0.05). Results: HLDdis data revealed the significantly highest damping capacity for metal and the lowest values for ceramics with composites and polymers in between. However, for loss tangent, the metal together with lithium disilicate glass-ceramics exhibited the lowest damping effects and polymer materials the highest results with composites likewise in between. A strong dependency of the loss tangent results on the filler content of the investigated CRMs was indicated (r = - 0.822, p < 0.001), while a positive and only moderate correlation between loss tangent and HLDdis was observed (r = 0.565, p < 0.001), which conversely revealed a very strong correlation (r = 0.911, p < 0.001) if the metal was excluded from the calculation. Conclusions: Although HLDdis and loss tangent values both allowed a distinct differentiation of the damping capabilities of various CRMs and the respective material types, HLDdis data appeared to more accurately describe the damping capacity of CRMs as the energy dissipation mechanism of permanent plastic material deformation, that is commonly observed for metals and some composite-based CRMs, is equally captured. This finding could be particularly interesting for the future development of new CRMs with improved mechanical properties as HLDdis data determination in principle is a very efficient and simple technique to entirely specify unknown damping capacities of materials.",Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.125480
Is the application of a silane-based coupling agent necessary to stabilize the fatigue performance of bonded simplified lithium disilicate restorations?,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThis study evaluated the influence of ceramic surface conditioning and storage regimen (baseline vs. aging) on the fatigue performance of simplified lithium disilicate glass-ceramic restorations. A total of 90 ceramic discs (Ø= 10 mm; thickness= 1.0 mm) were allocated into 6 groups (n= 15), considering 2 factors: “ceramic surface treatment” – CA (only silane-based coupling agent, Monobond N), HF (5% hydrofluoric acid etching), or HF+CA (5% HF acid etching plus silane-based coupling agent); and “storage regimen” – baseline (24 hours – 5 days of distilled water at 37 °C), or long-term aging (180 days of distilled water at 37 °C + 25,000 thermal cycles). After intaglio ceramic conditioning, adhesive bonding (Multilink N) was performed onto epoxy resin discs (Ø= 10 mm; thickness= 2.5 mm) and the bonded sets were subjected to step-stress fatigue tests (initial load: 200 N; step-size: 50 N; 10,000 cycles per step; 20 Hz). Fatigue data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Weibull statistical analyses. Fractography and topography analyses were also conducted. The fatigue findings demonstrated that the performance among groups for both baseline and aging conditions maintained a tendency: the CA groups had the worst behavior (baseline: 893 N/143,667 cycles; aging: 639 N/84,179 cycles), while the surface etching with HF (baseline: 1247 N/214,333 cycles; aging: 816.67 N/128,333 cycles) and HF+CA groups (baseline: 1290 N/222,333 cycles; aging: 900 N/145,000 cycles) had no statistically significant difference between them. The aging protocol reduced the performance of all groups. The groups with better fatigue performance (HF and HF+CA) did not have statistical differences regarding structural reliability (Weibull modulus). Most failures were radial cracks from the cementation interface, except for CA aging specimens, with 27% failing from debonding. The HF etching led to noteworthy surface topographical alterations. Micromechanical interlocking resulting from HF acid etching remained prevalent in the fatigue behavior. Thus, the silane-based coupling agent (Monobond N) does not need to be applied after HF etching in terms of fatigue behavior outcomes.",Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.131282
Enhancement of leaching efficiency for Li by phase transformation from lithium aluminum silicate (LAS) glass-ceramics,"© 2021The mechanism of Li leaching from lithium aluminum silicate glass-ceramics was investigated to facilitate the recovery of Li. The experimental process was divided into the phase transition of the crystal structure through heat treatment and the Li leaching process using NaOH. Phase transition of the crystal structure based on the reaction temperature and heat treatment time was examined through X-ray diffraction analysis. The effects of the NaOH concentration, particle size, stirring speed, reaction temperature, solid/liquid ratio, and reaction time on Li leaching from heat-treated LAS was investigated. The results show that the crystal structure of lithium aluminum silicate glass-ceramics transitioned from hexagonal to tetragonal, and the efficiency of Li leaching from lithium aluminum silicate glass-ceramics before and after heat treatment was 68% and 99.6%, respectively. Accordingly, heat treatment increased the Li leaching efficiency by approximately 1.5-fold. To investigate the cause of the improvement of leaching efficiency, we calculated the lattice constant by using the interplanar spacing and Miller indices obtained from the X-ray diffraction analysis results for the respective powder samples. The results show that the crystal structure expanded approximately four-fold, and the reactivity with NaOH increased.",Hydrometallurgy,10.1007/s11664-021-09308-6
Basalt-Containing Pressed Cement Plates for Construction Systems: Technological and Toxicological Characterization,"© 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.In recent years, industries have been demanded for better disposal methods of byproducts. In addition, civil construction in Brazil has been steadily growing, necessitating the development of new resources and the use of new materials. Thus, to reduce the environmental impact and costs, the use of byproducts in civil construction plays an important role. This study presents experimental results on the development of cementitious material-based plates for the construction system of panel slabs using powder technology to reduce the amount of concrete in the slab. In this study, sand was partially (58.1% by weight, C3) and totally (C1) replaced by basalt powder, a byproduct of the basaltic rock beneficiation process. Cementitious plates were obtained by uniaxial pressing at different compaction pressures. The moulded plates (M) using sand and cement were obtained as references. The bending strength at 28 days of curing was 2.50±0.10 MPa, which is higher than that of the moulded plates (1.94±0.11 MPa). It was concluded that pressing and sand substitution by basalt reduced the linear expansion from 0.059%±0.003% (M) to 0.042%±0.007% (C3), reducing the risk of cracking. The evaluation of the environmental impact showed the potential of replacing sand with basalt, thus reducing the cost of the material. Therefore, pressed plates with the total substitution of sand by basalt achieved better results related to the moulded plates and demonstrated considerable potential for application in the civil construction industry.",Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering,10.1016/j.jre.2021.09.014
The preparation and properties performance of lithium carbonate @ manganese dioxide @ white carbon black electrode materials,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.In this paper, novel composite materials based on white carbon black were synthesized and used to prepare high-performance electrode materials. First, white carbon black was activated by sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to remove the impurities, and the specific surface area of activated white carbon black could be increased to load other conductive materials. Second, the activated white carbon black was respectively mixed with lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and manganese dioxide (MnO2) with different mass ratios. Subsequently, those composite materials were heated to a paste, which were coated on a foam nickel sheet to obtain nickel electrode. Finally, laser particle size, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the electrochemical techniques were applied to characterize those white carbon black composites. On the one hand, when the ratio of white carbon black to Li2CO3 was 1:1, almost no impedance was observed, and the electrochemical performance was the best. On the other hand, the electrochemical performance was the best when the ratio of white carbon black to MnO2 was 1:2. White carbon black-based materials with high specific surface area could be prepared via one step by activation of white carbon black by NaOH. This method was simple to operate and showed the advantage of low cost as well as industrial application potential.",Ionics,10.1016/j.compstruct.2021.114992
Asymmetric magnetization reversal processes in amorphous composites (Fe40Co40B20)x(AL2O3)100-x,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The amorphous composite films (Co40Fe40B20)x(Al2O3)100-x with different content of the metal (Co40Fe40B20)x “(CoFeB)x” and the dielectric (Al2O3)100-x components were obtained in the original ion-beam deposition unit. Sputtering of a composite target from an amorphous Co40Fe40B20 alloy plate with dielectric Al2O3 inserts was carried out in the argon atmosphere at an operating pressure of ∼5.10–4 Torr on glass-ceramic Sitall substrates. The presence of two regions in the IR spectra of composites with different values of х confirms the existence of the metal and dielectric components during the ion-plasma deposition of composites on a sitall substrate as a result of self-arrangement. The magnetic hysteresis was measured at room temperature for (CoFeB)x(Al2O3)100-x thin film samples for x = 1, 75 and from 9 to 69 with the step x = 10 at different angles (φ) when magnetic field applied out of a plane (φ = 90°) and in-plane (φ = 0°) of the films. The obtained results show that at low alloy (CoFeB)x contents the film composites with nominal x = 1, 9, and 19 behave as paramagnetic from the first glance. With an increase of the alloy (CoFeB)x content to nominal x = 29–75 amorphous composites films seems as superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic materials that are characterized as reversal magnetization with no coercivity and remanence. The existence of a magnetic vortex in the samples with x = 59–75 opens different remarkable applications like data storage.",Materials Chemistry and Physics,10.1002/ente.202100343

Electrical Conductivity Enhancement of V2O5-P2O5-Bi2O3 Glasses by Nanocrystallization,"© 2021, The Author(s).The structural and electrical properties of the xP2O5-(40 − x) Bi2O3-60V2O5 (0 ≤ x ≤ 20) glass system have been investigated. The samples were prepared by the conventional melt-quenching technique. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed the amorphous nature of the present glasses. Nanocrystalline grains were found due to the annealing of the glass samples under study. Nanocrystals with an average grain size of 22 nm were implanted in the glass structure and estimated from the XRD patterns of the glass–ceramic samples. DC conductivity of the glass system has been determined in the temperature range 300–500 K. It was found that the general behavior of electrical conductivity was similar for all the glass compositions and found to decrease with increasing phosphate content. The electrical conductivity of the glass–ceramic nanocrystals obtained by annealing at crystallization temperature (Tc) was much higher than the initial glass. The activation energy (W) was enhanced by annealing and was obtained from plots of temperature-dependent DC conductivity, and found to be 0.23–0.31 eV for glasses and 0.19–0.23 eV for the glass–ceramic nanocrystals.",Journal of Electronic Materials,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.10.162

Glass-ceramic ferroelectric composite material BaTiO3/KFeSi for microwave applications,"© 2021Glass-ceramic composites consisting of potassium-iron-silicate glass and barium titanate mixed in various proportions were successfully synthesized by low-temperature sintering. The crystal structure of the obtained composite samples, the porosity and the microhardness were studied by the X-ray diffraction, the electron microscopy, the weight method, and the Vickers method. Electrical characteristics (dielectric permittivity, tunability and losses) of as-prepared and annealed in oxygen medium samples were investigated at microwaves. According to structural analysis, the synthesized samples are a mixture of KFeSi glass, ferroelectric BaTiO3, and dielectric barium polytitanates; the ratio of the latter determines the electrical properties of the composites. Depending on the content of barium titanate, the studied composite samples show a permittivity from 50 to 270 with a dielectric loss level of 0,1–0,02 in frequency range from 3 to 10 GHz. Annealing of composite samples in an oxygen-containing environment leads to an increase in their dielectric permittivity and tunability by 10–25% and a twofold decrease in dielectric loss.",Composite Structures,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.10.161
"Na–Bi–Ge Glass Anode as a High-Performance Network: Studies on Structure, High Rate Capability, and Long Cycle Stability","© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHHerein, the influence of nanosized amorphous intermediate domains such as Na3Bi and NaGe on the electrochemical characteristics of the new Na2O–Bi2O3 glass anode network mixed with “GeO2” nanocrystals is highlighted. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy pictures are evident of Bi2O3 and GeO2 crystals in the amorphous plain bright Na–Bi glass phase which is also justified in the X-ray diffraction studies. The initial (1st) and final (500th) charge and discharge capacities are recorded to be 1097/783 and 621/614, respectively. The columbic efficiency ranged between 71% and 98.8% as the current rate varies from 0.1 to 5 C. The ionic conductivity achieved is quite high even for the 500th cycle. This is due to the lowest value of Rct in the electro impedance spectroscopy spectra, which indicates a rise in electronic conductivity.

Crystal structure determination of a new LaPO4 phase in a multicomponent glass ceramic via 3D electron diffraction,"© 2021A glass ceramic from the MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 system containing additives of ZrO2, TiO2, La2O3 and P2O5 was investigated. Via x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and Transmission electron microscopy(TEM) the crystalline phases present could be identified as MgAl2O4 (Spinel), orthorhombic ZrTiO4 and a polymorph of LaPO4 with a previously unknown crystal structure. The crystal structure of this LaPO4 phase was solved ab initio via 3D ED Data. The polymorph occurs in a distorted barite structure type in the same space group (P21/n) as the stable monazite type polymorph, however the density is higher and the La has a higher coordination number. Furthermore the LaPO4 is present in a spinodal relict microstructure. Potential explanations for the presence of this metastable polymorph are pressure due to residual stresses from the crystallization or surface effects due to the high surface area resulting from the spinodal relict structure.",Ceramics International,10.1111/jace.18165
Synthesis of amorphous KAlSi3O8 for cesium radionuclide immobilization into solid matrices using spark plasma sintering technique,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.An effective sorption material for cesium radionuclides immobilization in highly safe and reliable solid-state matrices was proposed. Prepared aluminosilicate (КAlSi3O8) adsorbent had amorphous mesoporous structure and Cs+ ions sorption capacity of ∼3.7 mmol/g. The physical-chemical characteristics of (Cs, К)AlSi3O8 sample saturated with Cs + ions were studied using XRD, FT-IR, SEM-EDX, and DTA-TG methods. Firstly, solid-state aluminosilicate matrices were obtained using spark plasma sintering (SPS) technology with high values of relative density (up to 99.9%), compressive strength (31.3–79.2 MPa), and Vickers microhardness (0.9–5.3 GPa). The sample obtained at 1000 °C had a low value of Cs+ leaching from matrices (RCs within the range of 10-7 g cm-2·day-1) and cesium diffusion coefficient (De 9.07 × 10-14 cm2/s). It was shown that prepared aluminosilicate cesium matrices comply with regulatory requirements of GOST R 50926-96 and ANSI/ANS 16.1.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jlumin.2021.118553
Fabrication of glass ceramic sealants with ceramic fiber filler for solid oxide fuel cells,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.In this study, ceramic fibers are used as a filler material for glass ceramic sealant in solid oxide fuel cells to improve the thermal cycle behavior. Beside the bare glass ceramic sealant for comparison, multilayered sealants with different ceramic fiber contents are fabricated to investigate the effect of ceramic fiber quantity also. The mechanical performances of the samples are measured via tensile tests by placing them between two metallic interconnector plates after the glass formation process as well as after 1, 5 and 10 thermal cycles. The results show that the mechanical strength in general tends to decrease with increasing the ceramic filler content, which can be attributed to poor adhesion due to reduced glass ceramic composition. On the other hand, thermal cycle behavior of the samples with ceramic fibers is found to be improved at some extend. This may be due to the behavior of ceramic filler network and relatively slow crystallization with increasing the amount of the filler as proven by microstructural observations. Especially for the sample including 4 ceramic fiber interlayers each having 0.030 g ceramic fibers, the mechanical strength shows an increasing trend with the number of thermal cycles.",Ceramics International,10.1111/jace.18173
X-ray radiation shielding of CeO2 doped borosilicate glasses and their luminescence characteristics,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe novel shielding materials from (55-x) SiO2: 13B2O3: 1Al2O3: 4.5BaO: 6.3CaO: 0.2Sb2O3: 20Na2O: xCeO2 where x = 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mol% glasses have been fabricated at different CeO2 concentration by melt-quenching technique and studied the luminescence and radiation shielding properties. The transmission spectra show red-shift in UV range, due to higher Ce concentration in the glass matrix. The emission bands of glasses around 393 nm were observed from the 5d-4f transition of an electron in the Ce3+ ion. In the present glass matrix doped with CeO2 shows oxidation state of both Ce3+ and Ce4+. Decay curves are also investigated and found to be less than 100 ns. The X-rays shielding properties such as half-value layer (HVL), tenth value layer (TVL), mean free path (MFP), and linear attenuation coefficients (μ) of glass were investigated. The HVL values of glass samples at 5 mol% has better shielding behavior than commercial x-ray windows. The obtained results from the measurements suggests that these glasses are potential host for radiation shielding material application and also UV emitting device applications.",Radiation Physics and Chemistry,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.10.016
"Dual-mode optical thermometry based on transparent NaY2F7:Er3+,Yb3+ glass-ceramics","© 2021NaY2F7:Er3+,Yb3+ glass-ceramics (GC) with high transmittance were well manufactured using a melt-quenching technique and subsequent thermal treatment. Structure, morphology and photoluminescence properties of all samples were thoroughly studied via X-ray diffraction, transmission and up-conversion emission spectrum. Due to the improved crystallinity after thermal treatment, the up-conversion emission intensity of GC was significantly higher than the precursor glass. The optical thermometry performances of Er3+ ions at thermally coupled (2H11/2/4S3/2), and non-thermally coupled energy levels (2H11/2/4F9/2) were explored. Their relative sensitivities (SR) are 1.00% K−1 and 0.76% K−1 at 323 K, respectively. Moreover, their maximum temperature measurement errors (ΔT) are 0.09 K and 0.12 K at 563 K, with repeatability (R) exceeding 99% and 98%, respectively. All of the findings suggest that NaY2F7 GC are excellent self-calibration temperature measuring materials, with superior temperature resolution and repeatability.",Ceramics International,10.1007/s10008-021-05063-0
Enhancing glass anode performance for lithium-ion batteries via crystallization,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyWe investigate the thermal and electrochemical properties of xFe2O3-(100-x) P2O5 glass (x = 20, 30, 40, and 50 mol%) and 50Fe2O3-50P2O5 (50FeP) glass-ceramics as anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). The results show that both the glass transition temperature and the energy bandgap monotonically decrease with the increasing Fe2O3 while a critical Fe2O3 content of 30 mol% is found to give glass the highest thermal stability, the largest capacity at 1 Ag-1, and the lowest charge-transfer resistance before cycling. Moreover, Fe3(P2O7)2 crystals formed during heat treatment in 50FeP glass effectively enhances the electrochemical properties. The optimum heat treatment condition for 50FeP glass is found at 1033 K for 4 h, that is, 1033 K-4 h sample enables a reversible capacity of 237 mA h g−1 at the end of 1000 cycles at 1 Ag-1, which is more than 1.5 times higher than that of the 50FeP glass-based anode. These findings suggest that the Fe2O3-P2O5 glass-ceramics hold significant potential for the effective development of new types of glass anodes for future advanced LiBs.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/jace.18162
Enhanced luminescence of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals-glass composite scintillators based on Ce3+-doped borosilicate glass,"© 2021CsPbBr3 nanocrystals-glass composite scintillators based on Ce3+-doped borosilicate glass were prepared by melt-quenching method with further heat-treatment. Incorporating Ce3+ into borosilicate glasses matrix, highly enhanced green emission was observed under 365 nm ultraviolet and X-ray excitation. The transmittance of the prepared CsPbBr3 nanocrystals-glass is as high as 80% at 527 nm, fluorescence lifetime is 21.6 ns, and the luminescent quantum efficiency reaches up to 28% after thermal treatment (550 °C, 12 h). Compared with undoped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals-glass, the X-ray excited luminescence intensity of Ce3+ doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals-glass is around 190%, which indicates that the issue of absorbing ray energy in glass matrix can be effectively solved by incorporation of Ce3+ ions.",Journal of Luminescence,10.1007/s00170-021-08081-4
Sodium zirconium phosphate-based glass-ceramics as potential wasteforms for the immobilization of nuclear wastes,"© 2021 Commonwealth of Australia. Journal of the American Ceramic Society © 2021 American Ceramic SocietyA comprehensive study on the development of sodium zirconium phosphate (NZP)-based glass-ceramic composites as potential wasteforms for the immobilization of nuclear wastes is reported. Two complementary waste treatment routes, the ex situ and in situ crystallisation of NZP with a sodium aluminoborosilicate glass, were investigated with various processing conditions including sintering temperature, cooling rate and NZP to glass ratios. While the ex situ route with mixing of pre-made NZP and glass is a robust and reliable means of producing the glass-ceramic composites, the in situ crystallisation of NZP from an amorphous NZP precursor is a more realistic processing route. The formation of ZrO2 as a minor phase was observed especially for high NZP to glass ratios due to the solubility difference between Zr and P oxides in glass. The addition of extra phosphate can overcome this and yield glass-ceramic composites with appropriate NZP stoichiometry. Overall, the NZP glass-ceramic system is versatile offering multiple processing options for nuclear waste management.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1007/s41779-021-00662-6
Effects of alkali oxides and ion-exchange on the structure of zinc-alumino-silicate glasses and glass-ceramics,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdTypes and contents of alkali metal ions play important role on crystallization and ion-exchange properties in glasses. In this work, effects of Na2O/K2O ratio on crystallization and ion-exchange properties of zinc-alumino-silicate glasses were investigated. The crystalline phases precipitated in glasses changes from ZnO to β-Zn2SiO4 with the progressive replacement of K2O by Na2O in parent glasses. Ion-exchange depth of layer (DOL) decreases gradually with the increase in Na2O content in parent glasses. Precipitation of ZnO and β-Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals facilitated the ion-exchange and enlarged the DOL. Na+ and K+ ions were doped into ZnO and β-Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals during heat-treatment, and the extent of doping was facilitated by ion-exchange. Vickers hardness were improved significantly with the crystallization and ion-exchange. Results reported here are valuable for the controlled preparation and chemical strengthening of ZnO and β-Zn2SiO4 glass-ceramics.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1007/s00784-021-04132-y
Influence of microstructure and crystalline phases on impedance spectra of sodium conducting glass ceramics produced from glass powder,"© 2021, The Author(s).Crystallization of highly ionic conductive N5 (Na5YSi4O12) phase from melted Na3+3x-1Y1-xPySi3-yO9 parent glass provides an attractive pathway for cost-effective manufacturing of Na-ion conducting thin electrolyte substrates. The temperature-dependent crystallization of parent glass results in several crystalline phases in the microstructure (N3 (Na3YSi2O7), N5 and N8 (Na8.1Y Si6O18) phases) as well as in rest glass phase with temperature dependent viscosity. The electrical properties of dense parent glass and of compositions densified and crystallized at 700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C, 1000 °C, and 1100 °C are investigated by impedance spectroscopy and linked to their microstructure and crystalline phase content determined by Rietveld refinement. The parent glass has high isolation resistance and predominantly electrons as charge carriers. For sintering at ≥ 900 °C, sufficient N5 phase content is formed to exceed the percolation limit and form ion-conducting pathways. At the same time, the highest content of crystalline phase and the lowest grain boundary resistance are observed. Further increase of the sintering temperature leads to a decrease of the grain resistance and an increase of grain boundary resistance. The grain boundary resistance increases remarkably for samples sintered at 1100 °C due to softening of the residual glass phase and wetting of the grain boundaries. The conductivity of fully crystallized N5 phase (grain conductivity) is calculated from thorough impedance spectra analysis using its volume content estimated from Rietveld analysis, density measurements and assuming reasonable tortuosity to 2.8 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. The excellent conductivity and easy processing demonstrate the great potential for the use of this phase in the preparation of solid-state sodium electrolytes.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry,10.1007/s10973-021-10690-w
Toward revealing atomic deformation mechanics in lithium disilicate and β-quartz containing glass-ceramics,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyThe mechanics of glass-ceramics subjected to sharp contact or other loading conditions remain elusive, even after being commercialized in many industrial applications. We present work herein to reveal atomic details of such deformations that are otherwise extremely difficult to probe experimentally for a lithium disilicate (LS2) and β-quartz containing glass-ceramics via molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, the materials are comprised of LS2 and β-quartz nanocrystals in a residual glass matrix. Regardless of the deformation mechanism, whether it be nanoindentation or crack propagation for samples with pre-existing flaws, we observe that the LS2 nanocrystal itself undergoes substantial deformation, either by activating dislocations, forming an amorphization zone, or by initiating microcracks at glass-crystal interfaces or weak crystallographic planes. In contrast, the β-quartz nanocrystal is not easily deformed and remains almost intact with minimal plastic deformation, thereby forcing shear flow and crack propagation pathways to predominately occur in the residual glass and/or at interfaces. The dramatic difference between the crystalline phases also manifests itself in the deformation mode of interfaces under pure shear loading, in which shear bands preferably occur at the LS2-glass interfaces, while cavities form at the β-quartz-glass interfaces. These observations significantly advance our understanding of glass-ceramics and pave ways to exploit the understanding for more applications.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1007/s12633-021-00940-9
Exploring the deformation potential of composite materials processed by incremental sheet forming: a review,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.Over the past two decades, incremental sheet forming (ISF) has advanced the development of flexible sheet metal forming, especially for small-to-medium volume and customized production. To be suitable for various applications, researchers have explored the deformation potential of different materials, such as metals, polymers, composites, and so forth. For these materials, ISF-formed shapes and performances of the final components including formability, geometric accuracy, surface roughness, strength, and fatigue, etc. have been extensively assessed via analytical, numerical, and experimental approaches. This review article attempts to summarize the composite materials that are recognized and processed by ISF so far. Besides, deformation and failure mechanisms and constitutive equations used to describe their mechanical behaviors during ISF are discussed as well. The presented summary is aimed at aiding the ISF researchers in designing and manufacturing composite material components with desirable shapes and performances while providing a reference for future material characterizations related to sheet forming research.",International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,10.1007/s12633-021-00948-1
"Effect of isothermal treatment on the structural, microstructure, and physio-mechanical properties of Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 glass–ceramic","© 2021, Australian Ceramic Society.This work aims to investigate the effects of isothermal treatment on the structural, microstructure, and physio-mechanical properties of Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 (lithium aluminosilicate (LAS)) glass–ceramics. The different sintering temperatures affected the final crystalline phase formation leading to a variation of LAS glass–ceramic properties. This work also aims to achieve the most stable crystalline phase at high temperature in LAS glass–ceramics which is β-spodumene (LiAlSi2O6) with improved density, lower porosity, and higher flexural strength. The LAS was isothermally sintered at elevated temperatures of 900 to 1200 °C for 30 min. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed the complete transformation of β-spodumene from β-quartz occurred at 1000 °C. However, the sintering temperature did not change the crystalline phase when sintered above 1000 °C, but the lattice parameter of the crystal structure was slightly altered. It was observed that the LAS glass–ceramic grain size, density, and flexural strength increased with temperature. The smallest mean grain size of 0.61 µm for LAS glass–ceramic sintered at 1100 °C implied the increased flexural strength of LAS glass–ceramic at 146.25 MPa which is also influenced by the full densification at 2.46 g/cm3 with less porosity. The isothermal treatment indicated that sintering at 1100 °C provided a denser, less porous, smaller mean grain size and higher flexural strength LAS glass–ceramics which is preferred for thermal shock resistance applications.",Journal of the Australian Ceramic Society,10.4273/ijvss.14.1.24
Prospective clinical evaluation of chairside-fabricated zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramic partial crowns—5-year results,"© 2021, The Author(s).Objectives: A university-based randomized clinical study evaluated the 5-year performance of chairside-fabricated zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS)-ceramic partial crowns. Material and methods: Forty-five patients were restored with 61 chairside-fabricated ZLS-restorations (Cerec SW 4.2, Dentsply Sirona, Germany; Vita Suprinity, Vita Zahnfabrik, Germany). Deviating from the manufacturers’ recommendations, restorations with reduced minimum material thicknesses (MMT) were fabricated: group 1, MMT = 0.5–0.74 mm (n = 31); group 2, MMT = 0.75–1.0 mm (n = 30). For luting, a self-adhesive cement (SAC) or a total-etch technique with a composite cement (TEC) was applied. Statistical evaluation was performed by time-to-event analysis (Kaplan–Meier). Possible covariates of the survival (SVR) and success rates (SCR), evaluated in a Cox regression model, were MMT, restoration position (premolar/molar), and cementation technique (SAC vs. TEC). Results: Forty patients (54 restorations, premolars, n = 23; molars, n = 31) participated in the 5-year follow-up. Five losses due to ceramic fractures occurred in group 1 (n = 28) (SVR: 83.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71–0.96]). Group 2 (n = 26) showed no losses (SVR: 100%). The success rate for partial crowns placed on premolars was 100% and 69% (95% CI: 0.54–0.84) for molar restorations. Recementation was required in 4 restorations with SAC (SCR: 86% [95% CI: 0.73–0.99]; SCR-DC: 100%). Restorations in group 2 showed a significantly reduced risk of material fracture hazard ratio (HR) = 0.09, p = 0.0292) compared with the restorations in group 1. Molar partial crowns showed an increased risk for a clinical intervention (HR = 5.26, p = 0.0222) compared to premolar restorations. Conclusions: Material thickness and position of the restoration are risk factors influencing the survival and success rate of ZLS-ceramic partial crowns. Clinical relevance: Observation of an MMT of at least 0.75–1.0 mm for ZLS-ceramics is essential to avoid material-related fractures.

"Study of crystallization kinetics, microstructure and optical properties of Ce: YAG glass-ceramics for white LED applications","© 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.CeO2 doped Y2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 (YAS) glass composition was synthesized and devitrified to a single phase Ce: YAG glass–ceramics phosphor with controlled heat treatment process. Kinetic predictions for crystallization of the glass were derived from isoconversional analysis of DTA data using AKTS software. Activation energy of crystallization (E) at reaction progress (α = 0.5) estimated 659 kJ mol−1. The kinetic parameters were calculated as n = m = 2, representing two-dimensional nucleation and crystal growth with constant number of surface nuclei in this glass composition. From microstructure analysis of glass–ceramics we have seen the dendritic growth of crystals in the glass matrix originating from the surface creating a glass–ceramics phosphor layer of ~ 50 μm thick. No nucleation or crystal growth observed in the glass beyond 50 μm depth. Surface roughness found to increase the nucleation and accelerate the crystallization in the glass–ceramics layer. Five glass–ceramics samples prepared with increasing isothermal holding time and their photoluminescence spectra obtained by excitation with a blue LED light source. Intensity of broad band yellow emission increased with the increase in holding time which enhances the amount of Ce: YAG crystalline phase in glass–ceramics.

Dielectric properties of the glass-ceramics were studied in the frequency range 100 Hz-1 MHz at discrete temperature (100–600 °C). Density was found to increase in glass ceramics in comparison to virgin glasses. Room temperature dielectric constants was in the range of 16–24 at 100 Hz. The activation energy decreases (0.42–0.32 eV) with decreasing amount of rice husk ash (RHA) with respect to eggshell powder (ESP).

Model Prediction and Experimental Study of Material Removal Rate in Micro ECDM Process on Borosilicate Glass,"© 2021, Springer Nature B.V.Miniaturization of products has become a major technological challenge in production industries. Material removal in microscopic and sub-microscopic level has become a demand for producing such products. Electro-Chemical Discharge Machining (ECDM) is one of the hybrid non-conventional machining processes to machine materials that are electrically conductive and non-conductive at a micro-level utilizing the principles of Electro Discharge Machining (EDM) and Electro-Chemical Machining (ECM). The most common nonconductive materials machined with this process are various types of glasses, ceramics, composites, etc. In the current paper, a Finite Element Model (FEM) of the ECDM process is carried out in the discharge regime (less than 300 μm) with pulsed DC in a 2D domain to characterize the Material Removal Rate (MRR) as a process output response in borosilcate glass machining. From the model and experiements the value of MRR is found to be 0.373 mg/ min and 0.414 mg/min. It can be considered that there is almost negligible difference in MRR between experimental and model values with 9.9% error variation. Hence the results are validated with experimentation, and there is a good agreement observed between the results.",Silicon,10.1021/acsaem.1c03272
Study of Tensile Strength of Glass Epoxy Laminates with Varied Open Hole Diameter,"© 2022. MechAero Foundation for Technical Research & Education Excellence.Composite materials such as fiber reinforced plastics are massively used in engineering due to their high strength to weight ratio when compared to the other conventional materials. Due to its high effectiveness, it has been applied in the aerospace and defence industry, automotive industry, civil, marine platforms and systems and sports equipment. The holes in the composites are the main cause for the structural failure due to the stress concentration observed in the components whilst loading. It is important to investigate the effect of holes on the properties of the structural components. The tensile strength of glass fiber reinforced plastic was investigated with respect to ASTM D3039 with the loading rate of 2 mm/min. The samples were made by vacuum assisted resin transfer infusion method (VARTM) and the diameter of centric holes considered are 4mm, 6mm, 8mm and 10mm. The results are analysed to understand the damage criteria that caused the structural failure. When compared with specimen without a hole and specimen with a hole of 10 mm diameter, the maximum load-carrying capacity of the specimen was reduced by 47.9%.

Aerostat Airbag Damage Detection Based on VMD Decomposition and GenSVM,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The capsule of the buoy is usually woven with composite materials. The existence of material anisotropy makes it difficult to establish the degradation mechanism model of the capsule, which affects the defect detection and health management of the capsule. To this end, this paper proposes a data-driven airbag defect detection method based on stress wave measurement. Firstly, strain signals under acoustic excitation are collected by sticking strain gauges on the surface of the capsule. Then, VMD is used to decompose the signal and extract the energy characteristics of each modal signal component to construct the feature vector. Finally, the feature vector is input into the GenSVM model for defect type recognition. The example analysis shows the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.121256
A new universal force-field for the Li2S–P2S5 system,"© the Owner SocietiesLithium thiophosphate electrolyte is a promising material for application in all-solid-state batteries. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have been used to investigate the ion conduction mechanisms in single-crystalline and glassy compounds. However, the complexity of real materials (e.g., materials with grain boundaries and multiphase glass-ceramics) causes AIMD simulations to have high computational cost. To overcome this computational limitation, we developed a new interatomic potential for classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations of Li solid-state electrolytes. The training datasets were generated from representative sulfide electrolytes (β-Li3PS4, γ-Li3PS4, Li4P2S6, Li7P3S11, and Li7PS6 crystals and 70Li2S–30P2S5 glass). Using the functional forms of the Class II and Stillinger–Weber potentials, all parameters were optimized by minimizing the differences in forces on atoms, stresses, and potential energies between the CMD and AIMD results. Subsequent validation showed that the optimized parameters can reproduce the dynamics of Li+ as well as the structures of the crystalline and glassy materials. The ionic conductivity of Li7P3S11 crystal was approximately five times that of the isostoichiometric 70Li2S–30P2S5 glass, indicating that CMD simulations using the developed force-field accurately reproduced the effective conduction path in Li7P3S11 from AIMD. The developed force-field parameters make it possible to simulate complex materials including amorphous–crystalline interfaces and multiphase glass-ceramics in the CMD framework.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.121267

Insight into the Inhibition of Shuttle by Metal-Modified Covalent Triazine Frameworks and Graphene Composites with the Solvent Interaction in Lithium Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides is a key problem that has degraded the performance and limited the commercialization of lithium sulfur batteries. Currently, the composites with covalent triazine frameworks (M-CTFs) modified by metals in the fourth period and graphene (M-CTF/G, M = Li, Ti ∼Zn) were designed as host cathodes and are expected to inhibit the shuttling effect through the modification by the polar metal. Using density functional theory, it was demonstrated that M-CTF/G displayed synergistic adsorption performance of Li2S4 with unsaturated metal-N3 coordinated groups as active sites in the M-CTF. In addition, three solvents with different dielectric constants and polarity, namely, dioxolane, dimethoxyethanedimethyl, and tetramethylurea, were used to investigate the solvent effect, and the effective adsorption energy range of Li2S4 on M-CTF/G was evaluated in the presence of solvents.

Influences of Al2O3 content on crystallization and physical properties of LAS glass-ceramics prepared from spodumene,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Low thermal expansion Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 transparent glass-ceramics with low Li2O content and relatively high total content of Na2O and K2O (> 2.00 wt.%) were prepared from spodumene. And the influences of Al2O3 addition on structure and properties of such LAS glasses and glass-ceramics were investigated. The crystallization behavior and structure of the samples were explored by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that the addition of Al2O3 contributes to the precipitation and transition of β-quartz solid solution (s.s.) Besides, the smaller grains can be obtained in glass-ceramics with higher Al2O3 content, resulting in the higher visible transmittance. When the Al2O3 content is 21.00 wt.%, the transparent and low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) samples crystalized at 860 °C present the best mechanical properties.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.121226

The role of gold metallic particles on improving green and NIR emissions of Ho3+ ions in non-conventional SeO2 based glass ceramics,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.This study is devoted to investigate the role of Au0 particles on the improvement of luminescence efficiency of Ho3+ ions in a non-conventional lead boroselenate glass ceramic. Characterization by different spectroscopic techniques indicated that the samples consist of [SeO3]2− and [SeO4]2− structural groups. Among them, the fraction of [SeO3]2− groups exhibited an increasing trend with increase of Au2O3 content. These studies have further revealed that a part of Au3+ ions reduced in to gold nano particles during ceramicization process. Optical absorption (OA) spectra of these samples exhibited a wide absorption band with gradual growth with the Au2O3 concentration. This band is attributed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of gold nanoparticles. Additionally, the OA spectra exhibited several characteristic bands of Ho3+ ions in the spectral region of 450–2000 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of (Ho free samples) containing gold particles exhibited a broad band in the green to red spectral region, identified due to the transition of electrons from sp → d energy bands of gold nanoparticles. PL spectra of co-doped samples exhibited the emission bands in the green, orange and red regions with enhanced intensities as Au2O3 content is increased.

Crystallization and dielectric properties of oxyfluoride aluminosilicate glasses added with Na2O,"© 2021Mineralizers can efficiently promote the transition of barium aluminosilicate (BaAl2Si2O8, BAS) from hexacelsian to celsian (H-M). However, the detailed mechanism regarding the phase transformation of BAS is still unclear, especially in different glass systems. Herein we systematically studied the crystallization behaviors of SiO2-Al2O3-BaF2 glass in supercooled oxyfluoride aluminosilicate liquids with increasing Na2O concentration, and the influence of crystal phases precipitated from the precursor glass on the dielectric properties of oxyfluoride aluminosilicate glass ceramics was analyzed. We observed that the high addition of Na2O promoted no transformation of H-M, but resulted in the precipitation of second phases (e.g., NaAlSi2O6, Ba3AlF9). Our results provide guidance for designing glass ceramics containing celsian (Monoclinic BAS) nanocrystals with superior thermodynamically stable and dielectric characters.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.125369
Rare earth added barium alumino borosilicate glass-ceramics as sealants in solid oxide fuel cells,"© 2021Glasses with composition 50BaO-(5-x) Al2O3-xR2O3–30B2O3–15SiO2 (x = 0,5 and R = Nd, Gd, La, Dy) have been synthesized by conventional melt quenching method. Controlled crystallization has been carried out to convert these glasses to corresponding glass-ceramics. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique has been used to identify the crystalline phases formed in glass-ceramics. Archimede's method has been used to measure the density of glass-ceramics. The co-efficient of thermal expansion of all glass-ceramics lie within the range (11.60 – 12.81) x 10−6/°C, which matches with that of the other components of solid oxide fuel cell. The interaction study of glass-ceramics with Crofer22APU interface and Crofer22APU/Glass-ceramic/Crofer22APU showed no evidence of interfacial failure and cracks. Hence the prepared glass-ceramics can be considered as a suitable candidate for sealant materials in SOFC applications.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.10.058
"Investigation on crystallization behavior, structure, and properties of Li2O–Al2O3–SiO2 glasses and glass-ceramics with co-doping ZrO2/P2O5","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Li2O–Al2O3–SiO2 (LAS) glasses and glass-ceramics with co-doping ZrO2/P2O5 were prepared by the traditional melt quenching method and nucleation-crystallization process in this study. The effect of ZrO2/P2O5 co-doping on crystallization behavior, structure, and properties of the LAS glasses and glass-ceramics was discussed. The results show that the LAS glass ZP/0.5 exhibits better properties as compared to the other LAS glasses. As for the LAS glass-ceramics, ZrO2/P2O5 with mass ratios of 0–1 have little effect on the crystallization behavior. However, with the ZrO2 content increases to 4 wt% (ZrO2/P2O5 with a mass ratio of 2), an effective crystallization promotion behavior is found. Under a crystallization temperature of 950 °C, the LAS glass-ceramic ZP/2 shows improved properties, including lower density (2.526 g/cm3), higher Vickers hardness (7.23 GPa) and bending strength (94 MPa), and excellent acid and alkali-resistance (4.12 and 5.32 × 10−5 g/cm−2 h).",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.09.284
Crystallization kinetics and optical properties of transparent glass-ceramics embedding ZnGa2O4 nanocrystals with enhanced defect luminescence,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In this study, the transparent glass-ceramics containing spinel ZnGa2O4 nanocrystals were obtained by controlling crystallization. XRD, SEM, and TEM results show that after heat treatment at 750–950 °C, ZnGa2O4 nanocrystals with spinel structure can be precipitated in the glass matrix. As the heat treatment temperature increases, the nanocrystal size of ZnGa2O4 in the glass matrix shows an increasing trend, which results in a slight decrease in the transmittance of the glass-ceramics. However, it still maintains high optical transparency in the visible-light range. Under the excitation of 281 and 355 nm ultraviolet light, the transparent glass-ceramics embedding ZnGa2O4 nanocrystals show wide emission bands. Moreover, with the increase of heat-treatment temperatures, the CIE chromaticity coordinates of the glass-ceramics gradually move from the green-light region towards the blue-light region, which indicates that the transparent ZnGa2O4 glass-ceramics have potential applications in blue-green laser and color display.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151406
Analysis of the crack propagation mechanism of multiple scratched glass-ceramics by an interference stress field prediction model and experiment,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The crack propagation mechanism of glass-ceramics is the theoretical basis for the improvement of surface quality after grinding. The unclear mechanism of the multi-scratch interference effect on the crack propagation of glass-ceramics makes it difficult to propose methods to suppress crack propagation and control strategies to improve the surface quality. This research is aimed at understanding the influence of interference between scratches on lateral crack propagation, material removal mode, and surface quality during the grinding of glass-ceramics. In this study, the stress field model of the interference effect is established to reveal the influence mechanism of the interference effect on crack propagation in glass-ceramics. The amplitude and orientation distribution of the characteristic stress for the lateral crack are analysed. The results show that an increase in amplitude and the influence range of tensile stress and expansion merging under interference promote the further propagation of lateral cracks and brittle removal of glass-ceramics. Multiple scratches experiments produced by single grit were conducted, emulating the interference caused by multiple grits, and they were analysed by an interference stress field prediction model. For glass-ceramics, lateral crack/brittle fracture phenomena are predominant in the case of multi-scratch/double-scratch, whereas major plastic deformations are dominated in the case of a single scratch. A significant reduction in the critical cut depth is noted with an increase in the interference intensity which corresponds to the number of scratches. This preliminary work enables the understanding of the implications of the interference effect on lateral crack propagation in grinding glass-ceramics and provides a scientific basis for the establishment of a control method to suppress crack propagation and improve grinding quality.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.molstruc.2021.131533
An investigation about crystallization properties of vermiculite based machinable glass-ceramics,"© 2021This study investigated the crystallization kinetics of a vermiculite-based glass-ceramic system prepared by the melt-quench technique. Four compositions with different boron content consisting of SiO2–Al2O3–K2O–B2O3–MgF2 components were prepared, and then vermiculite mineral was added to these as 50/50 wt%. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) were used for characterization. The activation energies for the precipitation of crystalline phases have been evaluated, and DSC results have studied the crystallization mechanisms. Furthermore, a machinability test was performed to understand the machining performance of the samples. Density function theory (DFT) was used to calculate the interactions between SiO4-BO3 and SiO4-BO4. The glass-ceramics exhibited excellent performance in machinability tests without cracking or deforming. While the boron additive had different effects on crystallization, it caused the machinability to be negatively affected.",Materials Chemistry and Physics,10.1016/j.molstruc.2021.131474
Aluminosilicate glass-ceramics/reduced graphene oxide composites doped with lithium ions: The microstructure evolution and tuning for target microwave absorption,"© 2021Ceramic-based composites are desirable lightweight materials for electromagnetic (EM) energy absorption. However, due to the lack of an effective electromagnetic wave attenuation mode, pure ceramics still face significant challenges in absorbing electromagnetic waves. It is still challenging to obtain advanced electromagnetic wave absorption (EMA) materials with low fillings, thin thickness, super absorption capacity, and effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) through clever microstructure design and appropriate multi-component strategy. Herein, a dielectric aluminosilicate/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposite with different lithium content was constructed via a solvothermal sintering method. The microstructure and heterogeneous dielectric interface form perfect impedance matching, multiple polarization, coupling effects, and have excellent absorption performance. The absorbers display a minimal reflection loss (RLmin) of −51.95 dB by tuning the relaxation intensity, and the broadest covers all X band. In addition, the classic RCS simulation method to evaluate microwave absorption performance has practical application value in the field of radar stealth.",Ceramics International,10.3389/fmats.2021.747169
Superhydrophobic surface based on the self-growing structure of BaAl2Si2O8 glass-ceramics,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Superhydrophobic surfaces have great potential for applications in electric power equipment, photovoltaic cell panels, and other fields due to their unique self-cleaning and dry storage characteristics. However, the common process for preparing superhydrophobic surfaces faces the following problems: complex preparation process, high cost, and easily damaged hydrophobic surface structure. In this study, a self-growing monoclinic phase of BaAl2Si2O8 glass-ceramics with a microscale structure is used as a matrix, which was etched with hydrofluoric acid and then treated with 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane to obtain a kind of superhydrophobic surface with a contact angle more than 150°. The effect of the etching time on the hydrophobicity and the micromorphology of the glass-ceramic surface is analyzed. The results show that the contact angle first increases, then stabilizes, and finally decreases with increasing etching time. This etched structure has a large number of bulges and voids, and parts of the surface hydrophobic groups stay away from direct contact with other objects. Thus, it protects the internal hydrophobic group and improves the mechanical stability of the superhydrophobic surface. This study offers a simple and inexpensive idea for the mass production of ceramic-based superhydrophobic materials.",Ceramics International,10.1039/d1nj04496f
Noble metal free few-layered perovskite-based Ba2NbFeO6 nanostructures on exfoliated g-C3N4 layers as highly efficient catalysts for enhanced solar fuel production,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Two-dimensional (2D) organic semiconductors, such as graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), have gained extensive attention as a green alternative and possible route for photocatalytic applications due to their appropriate bandgap for the effective utilization of the visible light region. This paper presents the development of few-layered 2D exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets (eCN) by exfoliating stacked g-C3N4 layers (CNs) followed by incorporating inorganic perovskite-based Ba2NbFeO6 (BNF) nanostructures for solar fuel production. The optimized BNF/eCN composite material showed a high rate of solar fuel production, such as H2 production (1677 µmol·h−1·g−1), which is ∼ 8-fold higher than simple g-C3N4 and CO2 conversion into CO (32 µmol·h−1·g−1) and CH4 (4.8 µmol·h−1·g−1) production, which is 2-fold higher than eCN. However, only CO production (5 µmol·h−1·g−1) was observed for the simple CN. The enhanced activity of composite material was due to the improved surface-active sites of g-C3N4 through exfoliation, the unique properties of BNF nanosheets, and their combination. The present BNF/eCN composite system showed the highest efficiency compared to earlier reported g-C3N4-based photocatalysts.",Applied Surface Science,10.1039/d1tc03826e
"EPR-TL correlation, in radiation shielding Ba(10-x)MnxLa30Si60 glasses","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The well-known phenomenon, electron paramagnetic resonance, and thermoluminescence are used to investigate paramagnetically, and thermo-luminescent behavior of the materials to advance magneto-thermo-lumina applications. However, still, there is a necessity to introduce a correlation (or) mechanism in between electron paramagnetic resonance, and thermoluminescence to understand the radiation shielding (or) electromagnetic induction shielding phenomenon within the resource like glasses, ceramics, thin film (or) polymers. In this view, the Ba(10-x)MnxLa30Si60 series of glasses are prepared. The non-crystallinity behavior and glass-forming abilities are verified by X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis characterization techniques. The glasses are showing non-homogeneity, de-polymerization, entropic, and de-clustering behavior with increased MnO concentration. The thermal stabilities of the glasses are reported from the DTA studies. Ultrasonic velocities were recorded to evaluate the elastic characteristics of glasses. The radiation shielding studies of glasses suggest the radiation shielding phenomenon purely a function of the MnO concentration. In this view, the results and values of mass attenuation coefficient, radiation protection efficiency, mean free path, and energy absorption build-up factor suggest more glassy thickness is required to attenuate high energy radiation. The electron paramagnetic resonance reports suggest high order of dipole-dipole super exchange interaction and rhombohedral distortion within the glasses. Which also reveals the six-state characteristic trace of the octahedral Mn2+ ions. Upon 50 kGy, γ-irradiation, the thermoluminescence properties of the glasses are reported. Trap depth parameters are calculated, which reveal the resource developed are thermoluminescent at low activation energies. Moreover, to introduce the detailed correlation between electron paramagnetic resonance, and thermoluminescence phenomenon, we have annealed the glasses under 0 to 300°C temperature and upon the 0 to 50 kGy γ - irradiation dose level. In this view, the results upon the electron paramagnetic resonance and thermoluminescence properties obtained for the glasses are highly correlative.",Journal of Molecular Structure,10.1039/d1ce01160j
The characteristics on structural and optical of Co3O4 incorporated Zn2SiO4 for phosphor approaches,© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The melt-quenching method was used to fabricate a series of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) incorporated ZnO-SLS with the empirical formula (Co3O4)0.01 (SLS0.5 ZnO0.5)0.99 in weight percent. The glass samples went through a heat treatment process to transform into zinc silicate (Zn2SiO4) glass-ceramics. The impacts of heat treatment duration on structural and optical properties were investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the appearance of α- Zn2SiO4 peaks. Optical absorption occurs in the UV zone at wavelengths between 500 and 700 nm. The transition of Co2+ was discovered from 4A2 (F) → 4T1 (P). The optical energy band gap narrowed as the heat treatment duration increased. Co3O4-doped samples were found in the blue area of CIE chromaticity coordinates. The findings indicate Co3O4-doped Zn2SiO4 has the potential as a blue phosphor in the optoelectronic device.,Journal of Molecular Structure,10.1021/acsami.1c19799
The Improvement in Surface Properties of Metallic Implant via Magnetron Sputtering: Recent Progress and Remaining Challenges,"Copyright © 2022 Akhtar, Uzair, Rizwan and Ur Rehman.Bioceramic coatings on metallic implants provide a wear-resistant and biocompatible layer, that own ability to develop bone-like apatite in physiological environments to ensure bonding with hard tissues. These bioceramics primarily belong to Calcium Phosphates (CaPs), bioactive glasses, and glass-ceramics. Several techniques are used to deposit these coatings such as; electrophoretic deposition (EPD), plasma spray (PS), and Radio frequency magnetron sputtering (RFMS). Most of these techniques require a high-temperature operation or sintering treatment. This causes either thermal decomposition of bioceramic or results in delamination and cracking of the bioceramic coating due to differences in thermal expansion behavior of metals and bioceramics. RFMS is primarily carried out either at room temperature. However, annealing is performed or substrate is heated at various temperatures ∼400–1,200°C for 2 or 4 h under dry argon (very low temperature compared to other techniques) to ensure crystallization of bioceramics and improve coating adhesion. Chemical composition stability and excellent surface finish are the premium features of RFMS, due to less heat involvement. Moreover, RFMS has the unique ability to develop one-unit/ multilayered composite coatings and the flexibility of in-situ reactions to yield oxides and nitrides. Single or multiple targets can be employed with the insertion of Oxygen and Nitrogen to yield versatile coatings. Due to this attractive set of features RFMS has a strong potential in the field of bioceramic coatings. In recent years, several multifunctional bioceramic coatings have been deposited on metallic substrates using RFMS for biomedical applications. This review focuses on the recent efforts made in order to deposit multifunctional bioceramic RFMS coatings with surface characteristics necessary for biomedical applications and highlights future directions for the improved biological performance of RFMS bioceramic coatings.",Frontiers in Materials,10.3788/CJL202249.0101014
Broadband near-infrared persistent luminescence in Ni2+-doped transparent glass-ceramic ZnGa2O4,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.Transparent glass-ceramics are a highly attractive class of materials for photonic applications. Transition metal ions are promising candidates for luminescence centers thanks to the sensitivity of the ligand ions to d-d electron transition. Here, broadband second near-infrared (NIR-II) photoluminescence was achieved via precipitation of ZnGa2O4:Ni2+ nanocrystals within a zinc gallium-silicate glass matrix by a crystallization process. Excited by 260 nm UV photons, ZnGa2O4:Ni2+ GC displays NIR-II emission peaking at 1240 nm and has a full width at half maximum wider than 288 nm, attributed to 3T2g(3F) → 3A2g(3F) electronic transition of octahedrally coordinated Ni2+ ions. Moreover, broad persistent luminescence of Ni2+ ions can be effectively obtained after irradiation in UV light. Based on the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and a thermoluminescence method, a physical model was constructed to demonstrate the mechanism of persistent luminescence. This developed afterglow luminescent glass-ceramic exhibits potential applications in biological imaging.",New Journal of Chemistry,10.1088/1742-6596/2160/1/012038
Photocatalytic removal of benzene over Ti3C2T: XMXene and TiO2-MXene composite materials under solar and NIR irradiation,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.MXenes, a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides based on earth-abundant constituents, are prospective candidates for energy conversion applications, including photocatalysis. While the activity of individual MXenes towards various photocatalytic processes is still debatable, these materials were proved to be excellent co-catalysts, accelerating the charge separation and suppressing the exciton recombination. Titanium-containing MXenes are well compatible with the classical TiO2 photocatalyst. The TiO2 component can be directly grown on MXene sheets by in situ oxidation, representing a mainstream processing approach for such composites. In this study, an essentially different approach has been implemented: a series of TiO2-MXene composite materials with controlled composition and both reference end members were prepared, involving two different strategies for mixing sol-gel-derived TiO2 nanopowder with the Ti3C2Tx component, which was obtained by HF etching of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis products containing modified MAX phase Ti3C2Alz (z > 1) with nominal aluminium excess. The prospects of such composites for the degradation of organic pollutants under simulated solar light, using benzene as a model system, were demonstrated and analysed in combination with their structural, microstructural and optical properties. A notable photocatalytic activity of bare MXene under near infrared light was discovered, suggesting further prospects for light-to-energy harvesting spanning from UV-A to NIR and applications in biomedical imaging and sensors.",Journal of Materials Chemistry C,10.11896/cldb.20110148
Mapping the elemental and crystalline phase distribution in Cu2+doped 45S5 bioactive glass upon crystallization,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Bioactive glasses (BGs) incorporating metallic ions to impart antibacterial activity and stimulation of osteogenesis and angiogenesis are promising candidates for bone tissue engineering. Silicate BGs of the 45S5 composition (45 SiO2, 24.5 Na2O, 24.5 CaO, 6 P2O5, (wt%)) crystallize readily during the high temperature processing of porous scaffolds. The crystallization slightly suppresses the bioactivity and dissolution of the glass. Structural changes during the higherature processing of metal ion-doped 45S5 BGs are challenging since metal ions may affect the formation of crystalline phases during thermal treatment. In this study, we investigated the effect of Cu on structural changes during the sintering of Cu doped 45S5 BG (Cu-45S5). The Cu-45S5 BG was sintered at 900 °C and 1050 °C for 1 hour, and the resultant microstructures were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), including elemental distribution mappings from energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), and X-ray nano-computed tomography (nano-CT). XRD patterns of thermally treated samples indicate the formation of combeite and rhenanite as crystalline phases. Besides the crystalline fraction, a residual glassy phase is also present, which is enriched with Na and P ions. The results reveal that the crystallinity of Cu-45S5 glass-ceramics can be adjusted over a range of 70-78% by applying appropriate heat treatment profiles. Moreover, the size of the crystals increases with increasing temperature under the investigated conditions. Cu is found to be localized in the residual glassy phase, together with Si and Na, which has an effect on the release of Cu ions in physiological environments.",CrystEngComm,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.125576
Stabilizing Interface between Li2S-P2S5Glass-Ceramic Electrolyte and Ether Electrolyte by Tuning Solvation Reaction,"© Using solid-liquid hybrid electrolytes is an effective strategy to overcome the large solid/solid interfacial resistance in all-solid-state batteries and the safety problems in liquid batteries. The properties of the solid/liquid electrolyte interphase layer (SLEI) are essential for the performance of solid-liquid hybrid electrolytes. In this work, the solvation reactions between Li2S-P2S5 glass-ceramic solid electrolytes (SEs) and ether electrolytes were studied, and their influence on the SLEI was examined. Although 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) reacted with the Li2S-P2S5 glass-ceramic SE to form a dense SLEI, 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) severely corroded the SE, resulting in a loose SLEI. Consequently, a stable SLEI formed with DME. Using a combination of the Li2S-P2S5 glass-ceramic SE and the DME-based liquid electrolyte (LE), stable lithium plating/stripping cycles over 1000 h and a hybrid Li-S battery that retained a specific capacity of 730 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles were demonstrated. The knowledge of the reactions between the sulfide electrolytes and the organic LEs is instructive for the design of stable sulfide-liquid hybrid electrolytes for advanced batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.3389/fmats.2021.793647
High Reflectivity Mid-Infrared Fiber Bragg Grating by Femtosecond Laser Direct Inscription Method 飞秒激光直写高反射率中红外光纤布拉格光栅,"© 2022, Chinese Lasers Press. All right reserved.Objective: Mid-infrared fiber lasers have attracted much attention due to high beam quality, high photoelectric conversion efficiency, excellent heat dissipation performance, and prospect of all-optical fibers. They have important applications in ranging, remote sensing, medical and health care, absorption spectroscopy, atmospheric communication, polymer materials processing, infrared countermeasures, and basic science. A fluoride fiber with a low phonon energy and a low transmission loss is usually chosen as the medium for producing and conducting a mid-infrared laser. The structure of the space cavity mirror laser has such problems as low coupling efficiency, poor robustness, and easy deliquescence of fluoride fiber end faces. A fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based on fluoride fibers can be used to construct all-fiber lasers, which can effectively solve the above problems. However, the preparation of a mid-infrared fluoride fiber Bragg grating has not been reported in China. It is urgent to study the preparation technology of this key device. In this work, a mid-infrared FBG with a central wavelength of 2964.34 nm and a reflectivity of 99.27% is directly prepared in a fluoride fiber by femtosecond laser line-by-line direct writing method. This work is helpful to improve the operation stability, reliability and miniaturization of a mid-infrared fiber laser, and promote the application of corresponding mid-infrared fiber laser technologies. Methods: In this paper, an FBG is prepared by femtosecond laser direct inscription method, and a 513 nm femtosecond laser is selected as the source. The fiber moves uniformly through a high precision three-dimensional displacement platform. The FBG testing device consists of a supercontinuum source, a coupled lens, and a spectrometer. The supercontinuum source (0.53.1 μm) is coupled to a ZBLAN fiber with an FBG through a pair of coupling lenses (lens material of CaF2, focal length f=15 mm), and the end is directly connected to the spectrometer for transmission spectral testing. By comparing various preparation methods of FBGs, the femtosecond laser line-by-line inscription method has the advantages of high efficiency, low cost, flexibility, and good spectral characteristics. We choose the femtosecond laser line-by-line inscription method to achieve the preparation of a mid-infrared FBG. By studying the effects of laser energy and grating length on the preparation of an FBG, the appropriate writing parameters are selected. The preparation of FBGs with different central wavelengths is realized by changing the period interval of each FBG. Results and Discussions: By comparing the grating fringe qualities under different pulse energies (Fig. 2) and FBG lengths (Fig. 4), a second-order FBG with a physical length of 6 mm is written under 150 nJ energy and 100 μm/s inscription speed at 2964.32 nm central wavelength (corresponding to a grating pitch of 1.994 μm). The resulting transmission spectrum of the FBG is shown in Fig. 4. It reveals a strong and sharp Bragg resonance with a reflectivity of 99.27% at 2964.34 nm. The refractive index modulation depth is 7.66×10-4. We study the effect of grating length on the reflectivity of a grating. The reflectivities of gratings with different lengths of 2.991 mm, 3.988 mm, 4.985 mm, and 5.982 mm are 48.2%, 63.47%, 81% and 99.27%, respectively. The grating length is linearly related to its reflectivity. Compared with other works, this paper uses shorter length and faster writing speed to inscribe a high reflectivity FBG (Table 1). In addition, by modifying the grating period interval, we change the grating period to 2080 nm and adopt the same writing parameters. We inscribe an FBG with a reflectivity of 99.12% at 3090 nm (Fig. 5). In the transmission spectrum, there is a side lobe with a central wavelength of 3091.2 nm and a depth of 6.62 dB to the right of the main response peak. When the FBG is applied to the laser, because the main peak is 13.92 dB higher than the side lobe, the gain of the main peak increases, and the parasitic oscillation generated at the side lobe can be effectively suppressed. Therefore, it is completely feasible to write an FBG in the direction of long wavelength by using an InF3 fiber with a long transmission wavelength as the writing sample and adjusting the grating pitch. The response peak of an FBG prepared in this paper is located in the region of the Dy3+ fluorescence emission spectrum, and it has more applications in Dy3+ doped fiber lasers. Conclusions: In this study, we use the femtosecond laser line-by-line method and a 50 × dry objective to study the influence of laser pulse energy on grating fringes. The pulse energy of 150 nJ, the inscribe speed of 100 μm/s, the line length of 50 μm, and the period pitch of 1.994 μm are selected as writing parameters. A mid-infrared FBG with narrow bandwidth and high reflectivity is prepared based on a fluoride fiber. The central wavelength is 2964.34 nm and the reflectivity is up to 99.27%. The mid-infrared FBG with a central wavelength of 3090 nm and a reflectivity of 99.12% is prepared by adjusting the period pitch of this FBG. And it is expected to achieve a long band FBG writing by this method. This work is beneficial to the construction of an ""all-fiber"" mid-infrared fiber laser, which is of great significance to promote the autonomy of the core device of a mid-infrared fiber laser in China.",Zhongguo Jiguang/Chinese Journal of Lasers,10.1016/j.molstruc.2021.131294

Analysis on Temperature Field at Contact Surface of Laminated CFRP Straps in Fatigue Test 层压型CFRP环带疲劳试验中接触面温度场分析,"© 2022, Materials Review Magazine. All right reserved.The laminated CFRP strap is a continuous strap with unidirectional fibers winding in layers similar to the racing track on two separate pins. In this work, the fatigue test of CFRP straps was carried out, and the S-N curve was obtained. Based on the test results, the effects of loading rate and pin material on the straps temperature were analyzed. The results show that the overall temperature distribution of CFRP straps is symmetrical, gradually decreasing from the top of the curve to the straight part, the highest temperature occurs at the intersection between straight and curve segment. On the basis of the experiment, the temperature field model of the CFRP straps was established, and the size parameters of straps were analyzed. According to the analysis results, the influence of the pin radius and the straps thickness on the temperature distribution is similar, and therefore the curvature was used to unify the two parameters. Under the same curvature, changes in pin radius and straps thickness have no effect on temperature gradient. When the curvature increases, the overall temperature and the temperature gradient both decrease. Considering the influence of force and temperature, a reasonable curvature of about 1.5 was recommended.",Cailiao Daobao/Materials Reports,10.2298/JMMB211008001T
Formulation of a truss element for modelling the tensile response of FRCM strips,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdModelling the tensile behaviour of Fabric Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) is not a straightforward task due to the inner complexity of the mechanics of this kind of composite materials. In fact, after that the matrix is cracked, the compatibility between the fibre and the surrounding mortar is lost and the system behaves as two separate elements connected by a brittle interface. For this reason, several research studies proposed computational approaches for evaluating the tensile behaviour of FRCM composites, usually referring to brick-based 3D Finite Element Models (FEM) or to complex numerical procedures. This paper shows the formulation of a simplified coupled truss element for modelling the tensile behaviour of FRCM composites. The proposed element includes the interface slip between fibre and matrix and the brittle failure of the fabric and allows to describe the response of the system between the cracks in closed form. The proposed element is also adopted for assessing the tensile constitutive response of FRCMs through a simplified assembly procedure, proving to be reliable and computationally efficient.",Construction and Building Materials,10.1007/s41779-022-00807-1
Structural Mechanisms in Soft Fibrous Tissues: A Review,"Copyright © 2022 Sharabi.Through years of evolution, biological soft fibrous tissues have developed remarkable functional properties, unique hierarchical architectures, and -most notably, an unparalleled and extremely efficient deformation ability. Whereas the structure-function relationship is well-studied in natural hard materials, soft materials are not getting similar attention, despite their high prevalence in nature. These soft materials are usually constructed as fiber-reinforced composites consisting of diverse structural motifs that result in an overall unique mechanical behavior with large deformations. Biomimetics of their mechanical behavior is currently a significant bioengineering challenge. The unique properties of soft fibrous tissues stem from their structural complexity, which, unfortunately, also hinders our ability to generate adequate synthetic analogs, such that autografts remain the “gold standard” materials for soft-tissue repair and replacement. This review seeks to understand the structural and deformation mechanisms of soft collagenous tissues, with a particular emphasis on tendon and ligaments, the annulus fibrosus (AF) in the intervertebral disc (IVD), skin, and blood vessels. We examined and compared different mechanical and structural motifs in these different tissue types, which are subjected to complex and varied mechanical loads, to isolate the mechanisms of their deformation behavior. Herein, we focused on their composite structure from a perspective of the different building blocks, architecture, crimping patterns, fiber orientation, organization and their structure-function relationship. In the second part of the review, we presented engineered soft composite applications that used these structural motifs to mimic the structural and mechanical behavior of soft fibrous tissues. Moreover, we demonstrated new methodologies and materials that use biomimetic principles as a guide. These novel architectural materials have tailor-designed J-shaped large deformations behavior. Structural motifs in soft composites hold valuable insights that could be exploited to generate the next generation of materials. They actually have a two-fold effect: 1) to get a better understanding of the complex structure-function relationship in a simple material system using reverse biomimetics and 2) to develop new and efficient materials. These materials could revolutionize the future tailor-designed soft composite materials together with various soft-tissue repair and replacement applications that will be mechanically biocompatible with the full range of native tissue behaviors.",Frontiers in Materials,10.4028/p-1c541c
Cu2O-loaded TiO2 heterojunction composites for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production,"© 2021The Cu2O/TiO2 heterogeneous materials were fabricated via simple hydrothermal and physical mixing processes to investigate the photocatalytic H2 production performance. The morphology evolution of Cu2O was systematically explored by adjusting the amount of chemical reagents. The CT-70 (the additive amount of TiO2 was 70 wt%) exhibited superior photocatalytic activity with H2 production of 8.33 mmol g−1 in 6 h, which was about 416 and 49-fold more elevated those of Cu2O and TiO2. The enhancement of H2 generation was ascribed to the proper band gap structure and the heterojunction between Cu2O and TiO2. This work provides a strategy for the simple preparation of composite materials with high photocatalytic activity.",Journal of Molecular Structure,10.4028/p-ru8tl1
Deciphering van der Waals interaction between polypropylene and carbonated fly ash from experimental and molecular simulation,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Pollution emitted from power plants, including a considerable amount of fly ash (FA) and carbon dioxide (CO2), annually increases and is challenging from an environmentally friendly and sustainable point of view. To date, laboratory-scaled approaches cannot efficiently replace the FA-landfilling and mitigate the stress from CO2 emission. Here, a practically operatable fundamental work by combining carbonated FA (C-FA)—immobilizing CO2 in FA—and polypropylene (PP) matrix is reported and reveals abnormal mechanical and thermal features clarified by calculating van der Waals (vdW) interaction from an atomic scale. This is the first study wherein the interaction between instantaneous dipole moment-induced PP and fillers is simulated and examined. The vdW interactions at the (hetero)interfaces are –59.66, –82.30, and −224.39 kJ mol−1 Å−2 for PP, calcium oxide (CaO; before carbonation), and calcium carbonate (CaCO3; after carbonation), respectively, which provides concrete theoretical support for interesting findings such as the independence of tensile strength on filler loadings and “well-grown” interface-induced higher conductivity characteristics of the composites. Therefore, this work can offer practical solutions to mitigate pollution, provide a new perspective on fundamental physical interactions, and guide the development of practical next-generation composite materials.",Journal of Hazardous Materials,10.11607/ijp.2022.4.e
STUDY ON A NEW PROCESS AND ITS KINETICS OF IRON RECOVERY AND GLASS-CERAMICS PREPARATION FROM DESULFURIZATION SLAG PROUČAVANJE NOVOG PROCESA DOBIJANJA ŽELEZO I NJEGOVE KINETIKE I PRIPREMA STAKLOKERAMIKE IZ ŠLJAKE PROCESA ODSUMPORAVANJA,"© 2022, Journal of Mining and Metallurgy, Section B: Metallurgy.All Rights Reserved.This paper creatively proposes a new process with desulfurization slag leached by ammonium chloride as pretreatment, and the main point of this paper lies in the processing of desulfurization residue leached by ammonium chloride. Through component analysis the formula is adjusted with high aluminum coal ash and glass cullet, making the melting point of the reduction slag around 1200°C, which facilitates the separation of iron and slag. At the same time, the reduction slag is adjusted to the target crystallization phase, so that the high temperature reduction slag after carbon thermal reduction can be used to produce glass-ceramics directly. The results show that iron recovery rate is over 99%, and diopside and nepheline glass-ceramics are produced, which shows that the new process is feasible. However, the crystal growth index is less than 3, which means that the crystallization capacity of the glass-ceramics is low, and nucleating agent is needed in the preparation of glass-ceramics","Journal of Mining and Metallurgy, Section B: Metallurgy",10.1007/s00226-022-01421-x
Porous magnetic Fe3O4/bioactive glass–ceramic (CaO-SiO2-P2O5-MgO) scaffold with enhanced self-heating ability for hyperthermia treatment of bone tumor—an in vitro study,"© 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Australian Ceramic Society.Magnetic bioactive glass–ceramic (MBGC) with bioactivity and a self-heating ability under an alternating magnetic field (AMF) is specially designed to treat bone defects resulting from tumor resection, thereby preventing tumor recurrence and regenerating the damaged bone. In this study, to enhance the self-heating ability of MBGC, magnetic Fe3O4/bioactive glass–ceramic (CaO-SiO2-P2O5-MgO) scaffolds were prepared using graphite-modified precursors and by completely covering the raw materials in graphite during the calcination process. The results show that graphite can prevent the oxidation of Fe3O4 in the scaffold, which gives the material good magnetic and magnetothermal properties. Under a magnetic field of 1 × 106 A·m−1, the saturation magnetization and coercivity of the scaffold were 18.2 A·m2·kg−1 and 4.9 × 102 A·m−1, respectively. Furthermore, when exposed to AMF (340 kHz, 1.1 × 103 A·m−1) for 10 s, a block scaffold (Φ 10 mm × 2 mm) showed an increase of 75 °C in temperature at the surface center. Simulated body fluid (SBF) soaking experiments revealed that the highly porous MBGC scaffold had good bioactivity. After immersion in SBF for 14 days, a hydroxyapatite layer covered the scaffold surface. Furthermore, cell experiments showed that the material was not cytotoxic to osteoblasts. An MGBC scaffold (Φ 10 × 2 mm) killed 56.8% of the MG-63 cells in a 30-mm Petri dish when exposed to AMF for 10 min. The good self-heating ability and bioactivity suggest that this novel magnetic glass–ceramic scaffold is a promising biomaterial, which may be used in the repair of bone defects after tumor resection.",Journal of the Australian Ceramic Society,10.1109/ICEM51905.2022.9910746
The Use of Thin-Layer Insulation Material in Technical Installations in Building Reconstructions,"© 2022 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.This article is a part of a scientific work dealing with the research of thermal insulation properties of thin-layer insulation material made of hollow glass-ceramic microspheres in relation to technical equipment of buildings. Until now, there has been a lack of scientific studies describing the effectiveness of thermal insulation properties of thin-layer insulation materials on distribution systems or technical equipment. Thin-layer thermal insulation materials may have a great potential for use in building reconstructions and associated reconstruction of distribution systems, where there is often insufficient space for additional conventional thermal insulation and where energy savings of the whole system need to be addressed. For this reason, a series of laboratory measurements were made and in this particular case, the insulation material was applied in a 2 mm layer to the heat storage tank and the heat losses of two models of the heat storage tank (without insulation and with thin-layer insulation coating) were compared. In addition, for a more comprehensive view of the issue, the two models were compared in two situations that may occur in practice, which are the cases of free and forced convection.",Key Engineering Materials,10.1080/10420150.2022.2136089
Preparation of Inorganic Foam Glass-Ceramic with Utilization of Waste Diatomite as a Raw Material,"© 2022 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.The focus of this research paper is the preparation of inorganic foam glass-ceramic with the utilization of waste diatomite as a raw material. The waste diatomite was first comprehensively characterized by the analysis of the chemical and mineralogical composition, particle size, thermal analyses, and microstructure by scanning electron microscopy. Followed by the pretreatment of the mixtures with the addition of a foaming agent which was sodium hydroxide. The mixtures were then formed by pressing them into pellets and fired by a powder sintering method. The pretreatment drying temperatures and firing temperatures of the prepared mixtures were evaluated. After firing, the resulting properties of the foam glass-ceramic were investigated with the utilization of an X-ray diffraction analysis, bulk density, and compressive strength. The possibility of utilization of waste diatomite in raw material mixtures for the preparation of inorganic foam glass-ceramic was investigated.",Materials Science Forum,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.10.321
Is Zirconia the Holy Grail of All-Ceramic Restorations?,"© Copyright 2022, Quintessence Publishing Company, Ltd.Ceramics have been increasingly promoted as high-strength restorative dental materials, particularly zirconia and lithium-based glass-ceramics. The evidence for zirconia as a well-performing dental ceramic dates back to the late ‘90s. The very first dental zirconia was stabilized with 3 mol% (or 5.8 wt%) yttria and doped with 0.25 wt% alumina as a sintering aid. This material, also known as tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (3Y-TZP), exhibits an exceptionally high flexural strength (often exceeding 1,200 MPa) and a relatively high fracture toughness (typically around 5 MPa /2), but is predominantly opaque and thus primarily used as a strong framework to support weak but esthetic porcelain veneers. Clinical studies have revealed that though zirconia frameworks are comparatively fracture resistant, chip ping and fracturing of porcelain veneers is a frequent issue. In addition, a veneer/core system inevitably increases the restoration thickness, meaning that more underlying tooth structure needs to be removed.",International Journal of Prosthodontics,10.1007/s12633-022-02196-3
An applicable orthotropic creep model for wood materials and composites,"© 2022, The Author(s).Abstract: Despite the engineering importance of creep of composite materials and other fibrous anisotropic load-carrying materials like wood, there is an apparent lack in useful experimental data in 3D. Proposed creep models are generally not commensurate with realistic data from experimental characterization. In the present study, an orthotropic linear viscoelastic model is presented and examined on its performance of predicting the time-dependent nature of wood and composite materials. The constitutive equations are presented using the hereditary approach. A clear description of the finite element implementation of the material model is given. Since constant Poisson’s ratios are a common assumption for viscoelastic composites due to lack of data, this study presents the effects of time-dependent Poisson’s ratio in the study. The model is calibrated against inevitably asymmetric experimental creep data using an optimization approach. With time-dependent Poisson’s ratios, the results show that the model is able to simultaneously capture the time-dependent behaviour in three material axis of orthotropic materials such as European beech wood and a fibre-reinforced composite. However, a relatively poor match was found when the Poisson’s ratios were set to be constant. Thus, the frequently employed assumption of constant Poisson’s ratios should be made with caution.",Wood Science and Technology,10.1111/jmi.13147
Polymeric Enclosures Impact Simulaton: Constitutive Model Optimization,"© 2022 IEEE.Mainly due to their competitive costs an manufacturing versatility, polymeric materials have become widely used among electric machine industries. Several standards have been developed to guarantee the structural performance and safety of polymeric enclosures, including the impact energy that it must withstand. However, applying numerical modeling to polymers under impact loading is not an easy task. This kind of material has a strong dependency on the strain rate, and this must be included in the Constitutive Model. Therefore, in this paper, a numerical methodology is proposed, using nonlinear optimization algorithms, to calibrate the materials model constants, reducing the number of required experiments. The results showed that, with the optimized models, the errors between the experimental and virtual Charpy and Izod Strengths were reduced to 2.27% and 11.25%. Additionally, the experimental validation of ABS fan covers under impact loading was conducted, evidencing the good accuracy of the proposed methodology.","2022 International Conference on Electrical Machines, ICEM 2022",10.1016/j.jre.2022.05.021

Mechanical properties of SPS sintered chalcogenide glass-ceramics with externally doped crystals,"© 2022The low mechanical properties limit the application of chalcogenide glasses in the infrared lens. This paper proposes a general method for enhancing the mechanical strength of chalcogenide glasses. A series of GaAs crystal-doped Ge10As20Se17Te53 and ZnS crystal-doped As2S5 glass-ceramics were prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The effects of crystal doping on the optical and mechanical properties of glass-ceramics were studied utilizing FTIR, XRD, SEM, ultramicroscopy, and Vickers hardness. The results show that adding GaAs crystal and ZnS crystal significantly improves the hardness and fracture toughness of the chalcogenide glasses. The infrared transmittance and mechanical properties can be further improved by reducing the crystal size.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.10.228
"Effect of Pb++/Sr++ Ratio on Physical, Structural, and Mechanical Properties of (Pb-Sr)TiO3 Borosilicate Glass Ceramics","© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.Numerous attempts have been made for the fabrication of bulk glass and glass ceramics (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5) in the system 64[(Pb1-xSrx)TiO3]-25[(2SiO2.B2O3)]-7BaO.3K2O-1La2O3 via a conventional melt-quench and solid state reaction methods. In order to verify the amorphous and crystalline nature of the glass and glass ceramics, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were carried out. Moreover, average crystallite size, and percentage of crystallinity were also determined using XRD data. Further, various physical parameters such as green density, sintered density, molar volume, and oxygen packing density were examined. To evaluate the structural and surface morphological properties of the sintered glass ceramics (SGCs), FTIR and SEM techniques were performed respectively. Further, to study various mechanical properties such as compressive strength, Young’s modulus, and break length of the SGC samples, UTM technique was utilized and found the maximum compressive strength, Young’s modulus, and break length, to be 250 MPa, 1.316 GPa, and 1.08 mm, for SGC sample (GC5), sintered at 850 0C for 4 h respectively.",Silicon,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.10.004
Laser-based sample preparation for high-resolution X-ray-computed tomography of glasses and glass ceramics,"© 2022 The Authors. Journal of Microscopy published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal Microscopical Society.X-ray-computed tomography with sub-micron resolution (nano-CT) is one of the most useful techniques to examine the 3D microstructure of materials down to voxel sizes 10 nm. However, since size and shape of samples have considerable influence on acquisition time and data quality, adapted and universally applicable workflows are needed. Three novel workflows for sample preparation using ultra-short pulsed lasers are presented which allow for reproducible fabrication, safe extraction and mounting of samples. Their application potential is illustrated via nano-CT measurements of glass ceramics as well as a laser-modified glass. Since the according sample geometries take also the requirements of other analytical techniques such as transmission electron microscopy into account, samples prepared according to the new workflows can be furthermore seen as a starting point for correlative microstructural analyses involving multiple techniques.",Journal of Microscopy,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.10.113
"Sm3+ ions doped Sm2Si2O7-based glass ceramics: Crystallization, luminescence and energy transfer process through heat treatment","© 2022 Chinese Society of Rare EarthsSm3+ ions incorporated Sm2Si2O7 crystalline phase formed in the aluminoborosilicate glass matrix synthesized via melting quenching technique followed by heat-treatment process is reported herewith. The preliminary confirmation on the obtained glass ceramics was made through X-ray diffration (XRD) studies. Formation of non-bridging oxygens (NBOs) in the glass network and the modes of vibrations of network units were analyzed through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies. Surface morphology of heat-treated samples at varying temperatures was determined via a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The absorption studies on heat-treated samples signify the low bandgap values and high Urbach energy values due to improved crystallinity in the glass network. Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters identified for visible absorption transitions follow the trend of Ω4 >Ω2> Ω6. Excitation and emission studies on heat-treated samples show improvement in their intensities compared to the unheated base glass. The thermal quenching is observed at higher temperatures (540 and 580 °C for 3 h) of heat-treated samples. Calculations based on luminescence spectra including radiative transition probability, stimulated emission cross-section and branching ratio show good results for glass ceramics prior to precursor glass. Longer lifetimes of Sm3+ ions (milliseconds) in the level 4G5/2 are seen for glass ceramics. Color coordinates suggest the reddish-orange emissions from prepared glass ceramics. Thus, Sm3+ doped Sm2Si2O7 glass ceramics are favorable materials for solid-state lighting and laser applications.",Journal of Rare Earths,10.1142/S0219519422400358
Highly efficient and thermally stable MnII-based phosphor-in-glass towards warm WLED,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Aluminate with the magnetoplumbite-type (LaZnAl11O19) represents a big family technology important compound. Crystallographic sites for transition metal and rare earth ion in the magnetoplumbite structure have always been a hot topic. Here, manganese-based magnetoplumbite-type La(Zn,Mn)Al11O19 phosphors were successfully synthesized via the traditional solid-state reaction and all the samples crystallized into the hexagonal structure. A narrow green emission band at approximately 518 nm with quantum efficiency (∼unit one) is demonstrated in LaZnAl11O19 host with Mn2+ doping equal 0.3. Temperature dependent photo-luminescence indicate that LaZn0.7Mn0.3Al11O19 sample keep excellent thermal stability. Meanwhile, the thermal ionization process was elaborated in detail.

"Evaluation of novel composition (SiO2–CaO–Na2O–P2O5, SrO–CuO) degradable amorphous silicate glasses properties and comprehensive characterization of the thermal features","© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The current work presents and discusses the findings of a comprehensive study on the structural, chemical and thermal properties of SrO and CuO incorporated SiO2–CaO–Na2O–P2O5 amorphous silicate glass with a novel composition. Here, fundamental features (experimental density, oxygen density, and hardness) of all glasses were determined and chemical as well as phase composition of the glasses was verified with XRF and XRD, respectively. Moreover, the thermal behavior (viscos flow and crystallization kinetics) of amorphous silicate glass was investigated by non-isothermal methods using DTA analysis. The activation energies of glass transition (Eg) were calculated in the range of 546–1115 kJ/mol by Kissinger method, whereas the activation energies of crystallization (Ec) were calculated in the range of 164–270 kJ/mol by three different methods (Kissinger, Ozawa, Yinnon and Uhlmann). Avrami exponent (n) values ranged from 1.17 to 3.28 demonstrated that amorphous silicate glasses have different crystallization mechanism. Working temperature, which is one of the parameters indicating glass stability, increased with the incorporation of Sr and Cu from 187 °C to 245 °C. The initial dissolution measurement has been applied to study the degradability behavior of Sr and Cu incorporated amorphous glasses in vitro. Quantitative evaluation of Si4+ (0.156–0.373 kV), Ca2+ (0.043–0.332 kV), Na+ (0.044–0.329 kV), P5+ (0.057–0.289 kV), Sr2+ (0.134–0.385 kV), and Cu2+ (0.090–0.203 kV) depending on the ion activation energy (Ea-ion) and ion concentration at different temperature values (24, 37 and 55 °C) was performed in contact with Tris-HCl solution by ICP-OES analysis. The results revealed that investigated glasses were degradable and incorporation of Sr and Cu affected the glass initial dissolution. Overall, investigated glasses are suitable for various application such as hot-working production, glass-ceramic manufacturing, and glass or glass-ceramic scaffolds fabrication, due to wide working temperature ranges and high crystallization tendencies of the developed glasses.",Ceramics International,10.1117/12.2627690
Enhanced up-conversion luminescence of Tb3+-Yb3+ doped glass ceramics by doping Li+,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Tb3+-Yb3+ co-doped transparent glass ceramics (GCs) containing Y2Ti2O7 crystal phases were synthesized by the melt crystallization. The light transmittance of GCs in the visible region reached 78%, and the average grain size was 278 nm under the optimal heat treatment conditions (720 °C/2 h). The GCs exhibited greater up-conversion luminescence intensity than precursor glass, and the reason for this result was explained in accordance with the Judd-Ofelt theory. Moreover, the introduction of Li+ did not change the crystalline phase of GCs. The emission intensity of the green light of the 8% Li + doped GCs was significantly enhanced by nearly 4.48 times under 980 nm excitation. The XRD refinement results suggest that the enhanced luminescence intensity is correlated with the change of the Y2Ti2O7 crystal lattice caused by Li+ doping. The relevant luminescence mechanism was elucidated. The results suggest that Li+ doped transparent GCs open novel avenues for green UC applications.",Ceramics International,10.1117/12.2628957
Effects of phosphate glass on Cs+ immobilization in geopolymer glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.137Cs is a major element in radioactive waste of nuclear power plant and there have been numerous reports on immobilization of 137Cs in the crystalline structure of pollucite (CsAlSi2O6). In this work, Cs-polluted soil (metakaolin) and a specially formulated phosphate glass were sintered together to form a CsAlSi2O6-based glass-ceramic. Extensive experiments and characterizations by XRD, DSC, SEM, and EDS allowed optimum glass addition to be established. The formation temperature of CsAlSi2O6 in the glass matrix was approximately 900 °C, significantly lower than those used in forming Cs-pollucite by conventional sintering methods. Raman spectroscopy and SEM studies confirmed that Cs+ was immobilized in the crystalline structure of CsAlSi2O6 and further, CsAlSi2O6 crystals were encapsulated in the glass matrix. When the addition of phosphate glass was 10 wt%, the leaching rate was lowest (3.35 × 10-4 g m-2 d-1) and the bending strength was the highest (30 MPa). We believe that this study offers a potential alternative and some useful data for safe processing of radioactive waste at a relatively low temperature.",Ceramics International,10.1117/12.2626863
"EFFECTS OF GRINDING, POLISHING AND AGING ON PHASE TRANSFORMATION AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF DENTAL TRANSPARENT CERAMICS","© 2022 The Author(s). The Author(s).Purpose: This study investigated the effects of grinding, polishing and aging on physical properties using self-made zirconia and commonly used ultraclear ceramic materials and glass ceramics in the clinic. Methods: The samples were prepared using 3% yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic (3Y-TZP) powder containing alumina, which was granulated by ball milling. Then, it is pressed into a circular sheet together with Upcera and Wieland materials. The glass ceramic materials are molded. Finally, all materials were subjected to hydrothermal aging. Results: The self-made zirconia had better permeability than the commonly used ultratransparent ceramic materials and glass ceramics. The polishing after grinding improved the surface morphology and roughness of tooth transparent ceramic materials; Polishing after grinding improved the aging resistance of zirconia materials. The bending strength of self-made samples was less than that of two kinds of ceramics commonly used in clinic, but greater than that of glass ceramics. Aging improved the bending strength of zirconia. Conclusions: The self-made zirconia had better permeability than ultratransparent all-ceramic materials and glass ceramics, and its bending strength was better than that of glass ceramics. Grinding and polishing could improve not only the surface morphology and roughness but also the strength and aging resistance.",Journal of Mechanics in Medicine and Biology,10.1007/s12633-022-02174-9
Optimization design of composite rod lay-up for deployable truss structure,"© COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.In order to improve the dynamic performance of deployable truss structure, a two-level optimization method for composite rods is proposed. The first level optimization takes the number of standard lay-ups as design variable, and the weighted sum of the fundamental frequencies of the truss structure in the folded and deployed states as the objective function. The simulated annealing and Bayesian regularization are employed to obtain the optimal standard spread layers of BP neural network, where the optimal number of standard lay-ups is obtained by the neural network mapping. Based on the results of the first level optimization, the second level optimization takes the orientation and thickness of each layup as the design variables, and a multi-objective optimization is formulated with the objective is to maximize the fundamental frequency and minimize the structural mass. The multi-objective optimization problem is solved by using the NSGA-II algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively increase the fundamental frequency of the deployable truss structure in both the folded and deployed states, and at the same time realize the lightweight design.",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.14716/ijtech.v13i4.4958

"Let's rethink OWL, ZERODUR as mirror-substrate material is available","© 2022 SPIE.Almost two decades ago, astronomers were looking for the next really big telescope. The so-called Overwhelmingly Large Telescope (OWL) rendered a primary-mirror diameter of 100 m. The OWL was a desktop concept study initiated by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in 2001 and completed in 2005. SCHOTT participated in the study as manufacturer of the low-thermal-expansion glass ceramic ZERODUR which successfully had been provided to the Very Large Telescope a few years earlier. However, the VLT blanks, with a diameter of 8.2 m, manifested the size limit of monolithic mirror substrate production. Larger-sized primary telescope mirrors were proposed by combining hexagon segments to complete the large mirror optical surface. This approach had been established in the twin KECK telescopes, combining 36 hexagonal segments to form a primary mirror of 10 m in diameter. The OWL study, incorporating the segmented-mirror approach, was targeting at the next level of telescope size: the Extremely Large Telescopes. Three different options on segment size were investigated in the study, yielding segment counts between 1500 and 5000 combined for primary and secondary mirror together. SCHOTT evaluated the technical feasibility of product specification and the process technology required to yield segments at a production frequency large enough to finish the scope of work within a reasonable timescale and budget. Today's market demands for industrial applications, as well as large telescope projects, triggered SCHOTT to increase capacity and capability via investments enhancing ZERODUR production along the entire production sequence. This contribution comments on the ZERODUR production capacity driven by industrial applications with regard to design options of the OWL study. Today's installed capacity will enable SCHOTT to deliver the OWL mirror substrates within a timeline comparable to the ELT M1 segment-blank contract. Further capacity expansion required by continuously increase industrial demand will enable even faster timelines.",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1111/jerd.12977
Resilience of ZERODUR glass ceramic under ionizing radiations,"© COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Spaceborne optical systems should ideally stay dimensionally stable under the conditions met over the orbital mission, e.g. stable under strong thermal gradients resulting from the instrument alternatively exposed to the sun then shielded by the terrestrial umbra and penumbra. In this situation, materials exhibiting a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mitigate the effect of thermal transients. However, deformations of the optics are not only due to thermal effects but can also be induced by environmental ionizing radiations resulting in compaction. Here we investigated the compaction of the glass-ceramic mirror material ZERODUR® under different types of ionizing radiations (3, e-, H+) and for different deposited doses representative of the environment met over typical orbits. A phenomenological model binding the compaction to the estimated deposited dose based on the experimental data is proposed and compared with the data published.",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1111/jace.18825

The initiated glass-ceramics formation was created by melting the basalt powder at a temperature of 1,250°C for 2hrs to obtain the glass phase. Glass parent crystallization begins with the stage of nucleation growth. The nucleation process occurs at a temperature 600°C for 1hr. The crystallization temperature at variations of 850, 950, or 1,050°C for 3 and 8hrs. The mechanical hardness test result was 637.28 HV1N of the sample with 1,050°C heating for 3hrs. The highest hardness value is at 837.33 HV1N for a sample of 1,050°C heating for 8hrs. The hardness value was decreased at samples for 3hrs heating, while it increased for 8hrs of a heating process. All of the heating treatments formed olivine and Anorthite phase but a pyroxene phase was initiated from 950oC heating process for 3hrs. The use of glass ceramic as an engineering material and biomaterials are promising. It is necessary to continue the development studies on the production process of local basalt resources.",International Journal of Technology,10.1515/ntrev-2022-0477
Two-wavelength excitation–driven robust operation of green up-conversion emission in Er3+-doped oxyfluoride glass–ceramic,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.Efficient optical modulation enables a significant improvement of optical conversion efficiency and regulation of optical response rate, showing great potential for optoelectronics applications. However, the weak interaction between photons poses a strong obstacle for manipulating photon–photon interactivity. Here, upon simultaneous excitation of 850 and 1550 nm, a fast–slow optical modulation of green up-conversion (UC) luminescence in oxyfluoride glass ceramics containing NaYF4:Er3+ nanocrystals can be achieved. Compared with the sum of luminescence intensity excited by the two single-wavelengths, green UC luminescence excited by simultaneous two-wavelength presents an obvious increase by approximate six times. Interestingly, the response rate of green UC luminescence relies on the pump strategy of two-wavelength excitation, showing as high as two times of the fast–slow response difference. The fast–slow optical modulation of green UC luminescence under two-wavelength excitation is promising for emerging applications in all-optical switching.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.378
Triple scan evaluation of internal and marginal adaptation of overlays using different restorative materials,"© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Objective: Problems in the confection of indirect restorations may increase the marginal and internal gap. This study aimed to quantify the marginal and the internal fit of overlays fabricated with three different materials. Materials and methods: Standardized cavities were prepared on endodontically treated human third molars and digital impressions were done using an intraoral camera (Trios 3). Restorations were designed (n = 15) and fabricated with three materials: Hybrid ceramic (Cerasmart; GC Corp, EUROPE), high-strength lithium disilicate (GC Initial® LiSi Press; GC Corp, Tokyo, Japan), and zirconia reinforced Lithium Silicate Glass Ceramic (Vita Suprinity; Vita, Germany). Axial, marginal, pulpal, and gingival gaps were calculated by measuring the distance between the restoration and the tooth at several reference points. Two-Way analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. The significance level was set at α = 0.05. Results: Mean gap was significantly influenced by the material (p < 0.001), gap localization (p < 0.001), and interaction between the factors (p = 0.002). For all materials, the highest gap was observed at gingival and pulpal surfaces (p ≤ 0.015). LiSi Press achieved the overall lowest values at axial values measurements (p ≤ 0.003). Conclusions: The performance of a CAD/CAM system relative to marginal adaptation is influenced by the restorative material used. High-strength lithium disilicate seems to be showed the best marginal adaptation. Clinical significance: Marginal and internal adaptation of CAD/CAM restorations could be influenced by the type of material chosen.",Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.10.036
Chipping of ceramic-based dental materials by micrometric particles,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.Chipping caused by micrometric particles poses a threat to the structural integrity of modern dental prosthetic materials. It can degrade their fracture strength and cause wear of both artificial crowns and antagonist teeth. Here, surface chipping of the main types of commercial ceramic-based dental materials at the microcontact/particle level is investigated by means of indentation tests. Conical tips of different sizes (radii 20 and 200 μm) under axial and sliding loading are employed to simulate individual microcontacts. Both decreasing particle size and adding a lateral contact force decrease the chipping load below typical bite forces. Specific damage mechanisms are identified as predominantly brittle fracture in ceramics with small, equiaxed crystals, with significant quasi-plastic damage in ceramics containing large, elongated crystals and composites. Critical loads for the occurrence of chipping are quantified (lowest values in equiaxed glass–ceramics; greatest in zirconia) and analyzed within the framework of fracture mechanics. The brittleness index (BI) is proposed as a simple indicator of the resistance to chipping of dental materials—the lower the BI, the greater the resistance. Special attention is paid to the effect of the materials’ microstructure, which can result in transformation toughening (as in zirconia) or quasi-plastic behavior (as in lithium disilicate), both highly beneficial to increasing the chipping resistance. Finally, practical implications for the selection of current dental materials as well as for the development of novel materials with improved durability are discussed.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.dental.2022.09.008
State of Art Review on Applications and Mechanism of Self-Healing Materials and Structure,"© 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE).Self-healing materials (SHEM) have extensive characteristics that significantly influence structural and polymeric components’ damage detection and healing behaviour. The composite materials with self-healing capabilities can automatically repair themselves after damage and lessen the economic losses. The present work aims to explore the recent successes in these endeavours from numerous kinds of research published over the last few years and focuses on methodologies/mechanisms, material types, and the excellent abilities of SHEM in various fields. The three objectives of the current article are: (i) to deliberate the motivation behind materials that can either extrinsically or intrinsically heal. (ii) investigate research on self-healing composites, emphasizing several healing systems or mechanisms. (iii) to review the most recent developments and applications of self-healing materials in different sectors.

"Characterization, biocompatibility and in vivo of nominal MnO2-containing wollastonite glass-ceramic","© 2022 Samah S. Eldera et al., published by De Gruyter.The present work pointed out the effect of adding different concentrations of MnO2 (0.25, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00 wt%) on the structure and crystallization performance of wollastonite glass. Nominal MnO2-containing wollastonite glass was prepared with the addition of 10% Na2O to decrease the melting temperature through melt quenching technique. The thermal history of glasses indicated that the crystallization temperature was between 864 and 895°C. The heat treating of glasses at ∼900 and 1,100°C gave combeite (Na4Ca4Si6O18), rankinite (Ca3Si2O7), pseudowollastonite (Ca3Si3O9), bustamite (CaMnSi2O6) and cristobalite. The later sample densities increased with the incorporation of MnO2 from 1.88 to 2.24 g/cm3 concomitant with decrease of porosities from 32.59 to 20.83%. The microstructure showed nano-size crystals in rounded, angular or irregular micro-size clusters, whereas after soaking in simulated body fluid for 1 month showed submicron crystals of carbonated calcium phosphate phase. Both fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray delineated the samples' biocompatibility. Also, the negative zeta potential results enabled bone cell activity. Moreover, the bone healing with complete mineralization was remarked in case of the in vivo implantation of the G0.50 group. These results can be of a great significance in the application of MnO2-containing combeite, rankinite phases for bone treatment and biomedical applications.",Nanotechnology Reviews,10.1007/s10854-022-09194-6
"Effect of Ta2O5 addition on the structure, crystallization mechanism, and properties of CaO–B2O3–SiO2 glasses for LTCC applications","© 2022CaO–B2O3–SiO2–Ta2O5 (CBST) glass-ceramics, with different Ta2O5 content, (up to 6 mol%), have been prepared by using glass melt quenching followed by heat treatment between 800 and 880 °C. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) results showed that the stronger the attraction of Ta5+ to the oxygens in the BO33− and SiO32− structures, the more easily the B–O and Si–O bonds will be destroyed. The underlying reason is most probably the high field strength of Ta5+, which results in a weakening of the vibration intensities of the [BO3] and [SiO4] units. Moreover, the Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) results showed that the softening point (Tg), crystallization starting temperature (Tc1), and exothermic crystallization peak temperature (Tp1), of the CaSiO3 phase, shifted to higher values with the addition of Ta2O5. Also, the crystallization activation energy (Ea) and the glass stability factor (ΔT) of the CaSiO3 phase increased, which indicated that the CaSiO3 phase of the glass became inhibited by the addition of Ta2O5. It was, thus, obvious that there was a need of glass characterization. The results of the crystallization kinetics showed that the critical cooling rate decreased with the addition of Ta2O5, which indicated that the viscosity of the system had increased. The CBST glass-ceramics, containing 1 mol% Ta2O5, that were sintered at 875 °C for 15 min showed excellent dielectric properties: εr = 6.22 and tanδ = 1.19 × 10−3 (1 MHz). To sum up, CaO–B2O3–SiO2–Ta2O5 glass-ceramics are potential low temperature co-fired ceramic substrate materials.",Ceramics International,10.2320/matertrans.MT-M2022094
Effect of the crystal structure on the optical properties and Ag sensitization of Tb3+/Yb3+ ions in silica-zirconia glasses and glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The role of the material structure in the energy transfer between Ag and Tb3+/Yb3+ ions is studied in silica-soda-zirconia sol-gel glasses and glass-ceramics. The preparation of Tb3+ and Yb3+ doped silica-soda-zirconia layers was carried out by sol-gel and dip-coating, followed by thermal annealing. The precipitation of zirconia nanocrystals was obtained by controlling the annealing temperature: from a full amorphous glass at 700 °C into a glass-ceramic at 1000 °C. A different crystalline structure of zirconia nanocrystals, tetragonal or cubic, was controlled by the rare-earth doping and investigated in relation to the Tb3+/Yb3+ optical properties. Moreover, Ag codoping was introduced by ion-exchange, obtaining a significant photoluminescence enhancement, both in the intensity and in the broadness of the excitation band, covering the whole UV region and part of the violet-blue region. Ag-sensitized Tb3+/Yb3+ doped silica-soda-zirconia glass-ceramics were attested to be potential candidates for energy-related applications, such as spectral conversion layers for solar cells, lasers and light-emitting devices (LEDs) in the visible and NIR spectral regions.",Ceramics International,10.1007/s00784-022-04728-y
Cyclic fatigue vs static loading for shear bond strength test of lithium disilicate and dentin substrates: A comparison of resin cement viscosities,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Objective: To explore the effect of resin cement viscosities on the shear bond strength under static and fatigue load of lithium disilicate and dentin substrates. Methods: Bonded tri-layer samples (lithium disilicate ceramic cylinder, resin cement, and substrate – ceramic or dentin) was performed considering 2 factors (n = 15): “resin cement viscosity” (high, HV; or low, LV) and “loading mode” (static, s-SBS; or fatigue shear bond strength, f-SBS). The specimens were subjected to s-SBS (1 mm/min, 1 kN load cell) and f-SBS (cyclic fatigue, initial load: 10 N; step-size: 5 N; 10,000 cycles/step; underwater). Failure mode, topography, and finite element analysis (FEA) were performed. Results: The resin cement viscosity did not influence the s-SBS and f-SBS of lithium disilicate substrate; however, it affected the bond strength to dentin, with HV presenting the worst fatigue behavior (f-SBS = 6.89 MPa). Cyclic loading in shear testing induced a notorious detrimental effect with a relevant decrease (16–56 %) in bond strength and survival rates, except for dentin substrate and LV. Most failures were adhesive. A distinct pattern comparing the disilicate and dentin was identified and FEA demonstrated that there was a stress concentration on the top of the cement layer. Significance: Cyclic fatigue loading in shear testing has detrimental effects on the adhesive behavior and survival probabilities of bonded lithium disilicate sets, regardless of resin cement viscosity. In contrast, resin cement viscosity affects the bond strength and the survival rates of dentin substrate submitted to cyclic loading mode, in which a low viscosity results in better performance.",Dental Materials,10.1002/jbm.b.35166
Thermal and Mechanical Properties of Glass–Ceramics Based on Slate and Natural Raw Materials,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.In recent years, utilization of raw materials was increased to produce natural low-cost glass–ceramic materials with distinct properties and appropriate for various applications. Therefore, five glass–ceramic samples were prepared using slate and natural raw materials known as limestone, dolomite and silica sand. Sample batches were melted in an electric furnace at temperatures between 1500 and 1550 °C for 2–3 h, casted, and heat-treated at 1100 °C for 2 h based on the results of differential thermal analysis to induce crystallization. The obtained samples of glass–ceramic were studied using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, microhardness and bending strength testing, and thermal expansion analysis. It was found that the glass–ceramic samples mainly comprised of β- wollastonite, diopside, and anorthite with ultra-fine grains and uniform textures. Furthermore, the fabricated glass–ceramic samples possessed high hardness values ranging from 9720 to 10,052 MPa, bending strengths between 97 and 142 MPa, and thermal expansion coefficients varying from 84.54 × 10−7 to 68.53 × 10−7 °C−1 in the range of temperature 20–800 °C. Thus, the good mechanical properties and thermal expansion coefficients of these natural glass–ceramic samples make them promising and suitable for many civil, engineering and industrial applications.",Silicon,10.1109/TMTT.2022.3203966
Mechanical and Dielectric Modeling of Adhesive Bonded Fiber Reinforced Composite Single Lap Joints,"© Proceedings of the American Society for Composites - 37th Technical Conference, ASC 2022. All rights reserved.Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites have long since been dominating the structural materials industry due to its superior specific strength and its ability to be designed for desirable mechanical and electrical properties. Using this formidable class of materials as structural components lead to the need of joining and bonding them. Adhesive bonding of composite materials are preferred over conventional mechanical fasteners, rivets, welding etc. as these tend to weaken the structure by introducing additional sources of stress concentrations. However, the complexity from the anisotropy of FRPs and the added convolution of anisotropic (composite adherend) and isotropic (adhesive) interfaces poses significant challenge to properly evaluate and model the adhesive bonded joints of composites. Significant experimental investigations have revealed correlations of material state degradation with the dielectric state variable defined as Dielectric Relaxation Strength (DRS). Due to the lack of appropriately defined physics in commercial simulation software packages, modeling such behaviors were challenging. In this paper a phenomenological modeling approach is taken to simulate the evolution of dielectric properties with the degradation of materials state. Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BbDS) tests were carried out while applying tension on the specimen. The experiment allowed for an in-situ measurement of dielectric property evolution with material state degradation. The experimental data obtained were used to formulate equations relating material's mechanical properties with dielectric variables such as real and imaginary permittivity. These equations were inserted into the material model as constitutive equations and the evolution of dielectric properties with material degradation were simulated using an 1D Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model.","Proceedings of the American Society for Composites - 37th Technical Conference, ASC 2022",10.1177/00405175221126529
Design of a BaO–Al2O3–SiO2–B2O3 glass-ceramic for microwave LTCC substrate material based on glass-ceramic + ceramic composite,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.BaO–Al2O3–SiO2–B2O3 (BASB) glass-ceramic designed to replace the glass additive in traditional glass + ceramic composite system as LTCC material has been investigated. The influence of additive amount of glass former B2O3, network modifier BaO and network intermediate Al2O3 on the thermodynamic properties of BASB glass-ceramics is studied. The results show that the increase of both B2O3 and BaO can lower the softening and crystallization temperatures of the glass-ceramic. At the same time, the increase of BaO content leads to the reduction in sintering shrinkage rate. The addition of Al2O3 can decrease the crystallization temperature, but the softening temperature will exhibit a complicated variation of decreasing at first and then rising. Based on the aforementioned results, an optimum BASB glass-ceramic consisting of 13 mol% B2O3, 24 mol% BaO, 12 mol% Al2O3, 50 mol% SiO2, 1 mol% ZrO2 and 1 mol% Li2O is produced, with the softening temperature of 650 °C, main crystalline phase of BaAl2Si2O8 after being sintered at 850 °C and the crystallization activation energy of 292.25 kJ/mol. The received glass-ceramic is then employed as sintering aid to fabricate low-temperature-sintered BASB glass-ceramic + Al2O3 ceramic composite. The 55 wt.% BASB + 45 wt.% Al2O3 composite sintered at 850 °C shows attractive comprehensive properties with a density of 2.79 g/cm3, dielectric constant of 5.88@10 GHz and dielectric loss of 1.54 × 10–3@10 GHz, which makes it a good candidate for microwave LTCC substrate application.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.307
Effect of Crystalline Ceramic Oxide on the Densification-Crystallization Behavior of Binary Lithium-Di Silicate Glass Compositions,"© Proceedings of the American Society for Composites - 37th Technical Conference, ASC 2022.

A 30 mol% Li2O-70 mol% SiO2 LD system was modified using Al2O3, P2O5 and ZrO2 by keeping SiO2/Li2O ratio constant at 2.33. The role of 2 to 5 mol% Al2O3, P2O5 and ZrO2 were studied in terms of Differential Scanning Calorimetry, XRD and SEM. The DSC results suggest that glass transition temperature increased with the inclusion of Al2O3 and ZrO2. It is also found that, inclusion of Al2O3 and ZrO2 helped lowering melting temperatures which reduced energy cost for melt processing. The study also suggested that densification was aided by the inclusion of P2O5 and ZrO2,.","Proceedings of the American Society for Composites - 37th Technical Conference, ASC 2022",10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.302
Ionic Conductivity and Microstructure of Li4GeO4-Based Solid Electrolytes,"© 2022 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials.Li4GeO4-based solid electrolytes can be synthesized at low temperatures, and their formability is improved by adding Li2SO4. Glassceramic Li4GeO4 exhibits a relatively high ionic conductivity of approximately 1016 S cm11 at room temperature, which is higher than that of glass Li4GeO4. Thus, Li4GeO4 has promising applications in all-solid-state lithium ion batteries. To understand the correlation between the ionic conductivity, formability, and microstructure of the synthesized materials, the microstructures and crystallization process of glass and glassceramic Li4GeO4 and 80Li4GeO4·20Li2SO4 (Li3.6Ge0.8S0.2O4) were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Since Li3.6Ge0.8S0.2O4 glass exhibits a halo diffraction pattern, the addition of Li2SO4 to Li4GeO4 stabilizes its amorphous phase. In addition, glassceramic samples were found to be characterized by an amorphous state containing nanocrystallites with a crystallinity degree of approximately 40%, which improves the ionic conductivity of the material.",Materials Transactions,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.236
Failure loads of heat-pressed versus milled lithium disilicate endocrowns,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Objectives: This study aimed to compare the failure load of heat-pressed versus milled lithium disilicate endocrowns. Materials and methods: Twenty extracted mandibular molars were sectioned 1.5 mm above the CEJ. Root canal treatment and endocrown preparation were done for all teeth. Samples were then divided into two groups: heat-pressed glass ceramic endocrowns (HP group) (n = 10) and milled endocrowns (CAD group) (n = 10). Cementation was done using self-adhesive resin cement, and a compressive load was applied on the occlusal surface of the specimens until failure occurred. Results: The mean failure loads were significantly higher in the HP group (2546.5 ± 339 N) compared to the CAD group (1759.9 ± 114.2) (p < 0.05), and majority of failures were due to fracture of the restoration. Conclusions: Failure loads of heat-pressed lithium disilicate endocrown are superior to milled endocrown. Clinical relevance: Molars restored with lithium disilicate endocrowns have higher failure loads than the maximum human bite force regardless of the fabrication method. Although heat-pressed endocrowns have superior failure loads to milled ones, both are indicated for restoring endodontically treated molar teeth.",Clinical Oral Investigations,10.1002/pc.27061
Bioactive fluorcanasite reinforced magnesium alloy-based porous bio-nanocomposite scaffolds with tunable mechanical properties,"© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Magnesium (Mg) alloy-based porous bio-nanocomposite bone scaffolds were developed by powder metallurgy route. Selective alloying elements such as calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) and strontium (Sr) were incorporated to tune the mechanical integrity while, bioactive fluorcanasite nano-particulates were introduced within the alloy system to enhance the bone tissue regeneration. Green compacts containing carbamide were fabricated and sintered using two-stage heat treatment process to achieve the targeted porosities. The microstructure of these fabricated magnesium alloy-based bio-nanocomposites was examined by Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and x-ray micro computed tomography (x-ray μCT), which revealed gradient porosities and distribution of alloying elements. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies confirmed the presence of major crystalline phases in the fabricated samples and the evolution of the various combinations of intermetallic phases of Ca, Mg, Zn and Sr which were anticipated to enhance the mechanical properties. Further, XRD studies revealed the presence of apatite phase for the immersed samples, a conducive environment for bone regeneration. The fabricated samples were evaluated for their mechanical performance against uniaxial compression load. The tunability of compressive strengths and modulus values could be established with variation in porosities of fabricated samples. The retained compressive strength and Young's modulus of the samples following immersion in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution was found to be in line with that of natural human cancellous bone, thereby establishing the potential of the fabricated magnesium-alloy-based nanocomposite as a promising scaffold candidate for bone tissue engineering.",Journal of Biomedical Materials Research - Part B Applied Biomaterials,10.1109/ICEPT56209.2022.9873172

Stretchable three-dimensional tunable frequency selective fabric of U-shaped units and its electromagnetic response mechanism,"© The Author(s) 2022.Three-dimensional frequency selective fabric, based on textile or textile composite materials, is formed by adding another dimension in the longitude along the two-dimensional (2D) plane, and has the characteristics of miniaturization and multi-resonant frequency compared to the traditional 2D frequency selective fabric. In this paper, tunable three-dimensional frequency selective fabric (3D TFSF) forming a U-shaped array is proposed. The U-shaped unit is composed of two velvets and a dipole at the bottom. Through analysis of the physical samples, the geometric model of the 3D TFSF stretched along the x-axis and the y-axis during the stretching process was established. The velvets of the 3D TFSF were studied in both oblique and upright states during stretching. The 3D TFSF has good tunability, while the velvets remain upright when stretched, and it has the characteristics of stable resonance frequency under small strain and adjustable resonance frequency under large strain. By stretching, because the shape and size of the U-shaped conductive units can be changed, the equivalent inductance (L) and capacitance (C) of 3D TFSF can change during stretching to realize the tuning of resonant frequency. The 3D TFSF offers more design freedom and possibilities. Significant effects of wave absorption or selective filtering by the periodic structure can be achieved by regulating the structural parameters and material parameters together.",Textile Research Journal,10.1080/1023666X.2022.2123575
Tailoring luminescent patterns with rare-earth photonic materials for anti-counterfeiting applications: A lightkey,"© 2022 The AuthorsAnti-counterfeiting strategies are competitively developed against fast-growing counterfeit markets as a cornerstone for the next generation of luminescent security inks, so it will be more difficult to mimic by ever increasing sophisticated counterfeiters. In particular, rare-earth doped up-conversion luminescent materials present important advantages such as invisibility in ambient light, excitation by low cost NIR irradiation, lack in background noise and negligible auto-fluorescence from the surface. Here we present colour tuneable up-conversion emissions in two families of rare-earth doped photonic materials (sol-gel derived nano-glass-ceramics and glasses prepared by melt quenching technique) for tailoring the overall emitted luminescence, as a sort of “lightkey”. In particular, intensity ratios among UV and VIS up-conversion emission bands can be tuned by modifying doping concentration level and excitation power density, as an additional security feature itself, giving rise to a multi-digit security code based on light-responsive encrypted patterns.",Ceramics International,10.1111/jace.18805

Preparation of self-foamed glass ceramics based on the cooperative treatment of various solid wastes: Characterization of structure-properties and analysis of self-foaming behavior,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Utilization of solid waste can be a preferable waste management solution. In this study, a type of self-foamed glass ceramic material was prepared using lead zinc mine tailings, red mud, and silica sand tailings through in-situ decomposition foaming. The effect of silica sand tailings content on the pore morphology, microstructure, and basic performances of the prepared specimen was analyzed. Meanwhile, the differences in the pore morphology and self-foaming behavior of the foamed glass ceramics were discussed. The obtained results indicated that the addition of silica sand tailings facilitated the formation of the glass phase in samples, and the composition, content, and viscosity of the glass phase could be changed by adjusting the content of silica sand tailings, resulting in a uniform distribution of the formed pores. Owing to their well-distributed pore structure, foamed glass ceramics exhibit excellent comprehensive properties (light weight and high strength), making them a potential non-load-bearing material. In this study, the comprehensive properties of the sample prepared with 40 wt% silica sand tailings were determined to be the best: exhibiting the lowest bulk density (0.63 g/cm3), highest porosity (72.6%), and an applicable mechanical strength (9.7 MPa). This study utilized three solid wastes through a reasonable combination based on their chemical composition, and proposed a novel technique for the preparation of self-foaming glass ceramics via the cooperative treatment of various wastes.",Ceramics International,10.1088/1742-6596/2338/1/012041
The electromagnetic wave absorption properties of woven glass fiber composites filled with Sb2O3 and SnO2 nanoparticles doped mica pigments,"© 2022 Society of Plastics Engineers.In this study, the electromagnetic wave absorption properties of woven glass fiber reinforced epoxy composites with Sb2O3 and SnO2 nanoparticles doped mica pigments were investigated. Herein, we synthesized SnO2/mica, Sb2O3/mica, and Sb2O3:SnO2/mica pigments using the sol–gel method. Subsequently, mica pigments filled glass fiber/epoxy composite panels were fabricated with a vacuum assisted resin mold. The phase, crystal, and morphological examinations of particles confirm the deposition of SnO2 and Sb2O3 nanoparticles on the mica surfaces. The electromagnetic wave absorption properties of samples were measured using the S parameters and obtained dielectric data. Sb2O3:SnO2/mica particles display higher complex permittivity and dielectric loss values due to the strong interfacial polarization between conductive nano metal-oxide shells and mica surfaces. According to the calculated reflection loss values, Sb2O3:SnO2/mica particles exhibit superior electromagnetic wave absorption performance with a minimum reflection loss of −25.62 dB for 2.4 mm thicknesses with effective bandwidth between 9.3 and 12.4 GHz. The S parameters of the prepared structural composites with the size of 30 cm × 30 cm × 3 mm was determined by the free-space technique using the transmission line technique.

The effects of B2O3content and Ca/Si ratio on the densification behavior and microwave dielectric properties of the CaO-B2O3-SiO2glass-ceramics for LTCC application,"© 2022 IEEE.In this work, the sintering behavior, crystallization, densification, and microwave dielectric properties of CaO-B2O3-SiO2 (CBS) glass-ceramics have been systematically studied with different Ca/Si ratios and B2O3 contents. TMA curves demonstrated that with increasing B2O3 content from 1.5 mol% to 16.5 mol%, the softening temperature (TS) was decreased from 776.5 °C to 691.5 °C, and the shrinking rate was increased from 13.81% to 30.32%, then decreased to 11.25%. With further increasing Ca/Si ratio from 1 to 1.30, the sintering behavior was greatly improved with the linear shrinkage increasing from 11.25% to 53.22%, which led to the increase of ϵr from 5.563 to 6.469 and decrease of tanδ from 1.99 × 10-3 to 1.54 × 10-3. Especially, the CBS glass-ceramics with Ca/Si ratio of 1.20 and B2O3 content of 16.5 mol% sintered at 850°C for 30 min exhibited excellent microwave dielectric properties, with ϵr ~ 6.092 (@11.37GHz), tanδ ~ 9.69× 10-4 and Q×f ~ 11737.47 GHz, τf ~ -17 ppm/°C, which are attractive for LTCC substrate application.","2022 23rd International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology, ICEPT 2022",10.1088/1742-6596/2338/1/012044

Polymers and polymer composites are employed in a variety of industries, from structural materials to electronics, as well as in our daily lives. PLA@LiYO2 nanocomposites films were subsequently fabricated by a simple solution casting at various concentrations for the development of electronic materials. The effective doping and homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles in PLA polymer is characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrophotometer, Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), elastic and dielectric properties of PLA composites films. XRD analysis showed that the crystalline characteristics of the nanocomposites increases with increase in dopant concentration. The FTIR absorption spectra of neat PLA and PLA@LiYO2 nanocomposites are almost equivalent to each other, from TGA analysis there will be less percentage of weight loss in the composite’s films as the concentration of the nanocomposites increased into PLA matrix, Moreover, a significant increase in Tg with an increase in NPs content from 0 to 4 wt% was also observed, the different elastic moduli such as E, K and G of PLA + LiYO2 films are indirectly proportional to the addition of LiYO2 in to PLA matrix.

Degradation behavior of heat-treatment silicate adhesive under special working conditions,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Inorganic adhesive is widely used in the sealing and connection of electronic devices. Its insulation is highly important in the performance of installation. In this paper, the insulation resistance and tensile strength of different composite silicate samples were measured by test machines. The morphology and surface composition were analyzed by electronic microscope and energy spectrum analyzer. The results show that: In a humid environment, the resistance insulation of adhesive increases with the rising of heat treatment temperature, and decreases with the increment of wet environment. When the modulus ratio of colloidal liquid is in the range of 7.2∼9.1 and the heat-treatment temperature is larger than 600°C, the effect of moisture resistant is remarkable. The tensile strength of adhesive deteriorates with the increasing of humidity. Furthermore, with ascending heat treatment temperature, the tensile strength rises when the modulus ratio of adhesive is less than 7.2, and declines when it is more than 9.1.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,10.1002/lpor.202200523

Effect of particle size on flowability of Lithium hydroxide powder,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In order to improve the flowability of lithium hydroxide powder, the lithium hydroxide powder in a company was selected under the conveying condition. The degree of circularity was used to quantitatively characterize the micro-morphology of the powder, and the influence of particle size on the flowability of lithium hydroxide powder was studied by the angle of repose method, HR method and Carr flowability index method. The results show that the lithium hydroxide powder gets better with the increasing of particle size. But the flowability of fine particles (≤ 100μm) is poor, while the flowability of medium particles (100∼200μm) and coarse particles (≥ 200μm) is good. Based on the experimental results. It is suggested that the inclination angle of silo should be designed to be no less than 500 and the content of powder with particle size less than 100μm in lithium hydroxide should be controlled to improve the conveying efficiency of lithium hydroxide powder.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.312

Near-infrared-shielding energy-saving borosilicate glass-ceramic window materials based on doping of defective tantalum tungsten oxide (Ta0.3W0.7O2.85) nanocrystals,"© 2022 The AuthorsNIR-shielding window materials were fabricated by direct embedding of Ta0.3W0.7O2.85 nanocrystals in bulk borosilicate glass-ceramics during a facile melt-quenching process. Optical and thermal performance of the prepared windows can be adjusted by varying the concentration of H2WO4 and Ta2O5 in the starting materials. The optimized window fabricated from raw materials containing 4.5 mol% H2WO4 and 0.3 mol% Ta2O5 exhibited high visible light transmittance 74.4% and strong NIR-shielding ability ΔT = 68.9%. Its thermal insulation performance is much better than soda lime glass or ITO glass, and its visible light transmission is higher than cesium-tungsten-bronze-based film coated glass. The distribution of Ta0.3W0.7O2.85 functional nanocrystals in the glass matrix was confirmed by sample characterization using XRD, Raman, XPS, HRTEM and EDS. The NIR-shielding property has been attributed to local surface plasmon resonance due to oxygen vacancies in the Ta0.3W0.7O2.85 nanocrystals.

Physical characterization and radiation shielding features of B2O3–As2O3 glass ceramic,"© 2022 Korean Nuclear SocietyThe synthetic B2O3–As2O3 glass ceramic are prepared to investigate the physical properties and the radiation shielding capabilities with the variation of concentration of the As2O3 with 10, 20, 30, and 40%, respectively. XRD analyses are performed on the fabricated glass–ceramic and depicted the improvement of crystallinity by adding As2O3. The radiation shielding properties are studied for the B2O3–As2O3 glass ceramic. The values of linear attenuation coefficient (LAC) are varied with the variation of incident photon gamma energy (23.1–103 keV). The LAC values enhanced from 12.19 cm−1–37.75 cm−1 by raising the As2O3 concentration from 10 to 40 mol% at low gamma energy (23.1 keV) for BAs10 and BAs40, respectively. Among the shielding parameters, the half–value layer, transmission factor, and radiation protection efficiency are estimated. Furthermore, the fabricated samples of glass ceramic have low manufacturing costs and good shielding features compared to the previous work. It can be concluded the B2O3–As2O3 glass ceramic is appropriate to apply in X-ray or low-energy gamma-ray shielding applications.",Nuclear Engineering and Technology,10.1055/s-0042-1753457
Effects of Al2O3 addition on microstructure and luminescence of transparent germanosilicate glass-ceramics with incorporated spinel Ga-oxide nanocrystals,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Ga-oxide spinel nanocrystals are wide band gap systems, which can be incorporated in a glass matrix by phase separation mechanisms. In suitable conditions, this kind of processes can give rise to transparent nanostructured glass-ceramics with UV excitation and luminescence properties potentially interesting in several technological areas. Nanophase size dispersion and volume fraction have been demonstrated to be controllable, at some extent, by suitable thermal treatments for nucleation and nano-crystallization in low-alkali gallium germanosilicate system. Here we report the results on the role of Al2O3 additions on the microstructure and optical response of the glass-ceramics fabricated in this system. Data of differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy show that Al2O3 addition, up to 4.5 mol%, turns out to have a considerable impact on the size and number density of precipitated nanocrystals, which are solid solutions of γ-Ga2-xAlxO3 resulting from the partial incorporation of Al3+ ions into the crystalline phase. We show that the use of Al2O3 as an additive in the composition of gallium germanosilicates facilitates glass melting and leads to glass-ceramics with significantly modified photoluminescence characteristics such as decay lifetime and integrated intensity of light emission. The possible reasons are discussed.",Ceramics International,10.1002/lpor.202200553

Aiming for high-performance white LD, herein, a brand-new material form for Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce) garnet, that is, the integrated composite of YAG:Ce phosphor-in-silica glass ceramic/phosphor-in-silica ceramic (PiSGC/PiSC) film-on-sapphire plate (SP), following an “amorphous → polycrystalline” phase transformation mechanism, is developed. Remarkably, nearly full crystallization from glass in a controllable manner can be achieved. The in situ precipitated SiO2 microcrystals with high thermal conductivity (TC) favor to build efficient local heat dissipation network inside this opto-functional composite, and therefore, substantially increase luminescence saturation threshold and luminous brightness under blue LD irradiation. Upon material optimization, bright and directional white light is generated with luminous flux (LF) of 1350 lm@10.5 W mm−2, correlated color temperature (CCT) of 7916 K, and color rendering index (CRI) of 69.3, enabling the application in high-brightness long-distance illumination scenarios.

The efficiency of ErCr:YSGG laser on the debonding of different thicknesses of ceramic veneers,"© 2022,Brazilian Journal of Oral Sciences. All Rights Reserved.Aims: To verify the efficacy of Er,Cr:YSGG laser for debonding of lithium disilicate (LD) reinforced glass ceramic veneers of different thicknesses. Methods: Forty bovine teeth were prepared and randomly divided into four groups (n=10/group) according to the ceramic disc thickness: C0.5 (Control group) and L0.5 (Laser irradiated group) in which LD discs had a thickness of 0.5mm and 5mm diameter; C1 and L1 in which LD discs had a thickness of 1mm and 5mm diameter. The lithium disilcate discs (IPS E.max®, shade HTA2) were fabricated following the manufacturer’s recommendations and cemented to the prepared tooth surface. The Er,Cr:YSGG laser was applied to the laser groups at 2.5W and 25Hz for 60seconds. Universal testing machine was used to evaluate the shear bond strength for all samples at a cross head speed of 1mm/min in an inciso-gingival direction parallel to the sample surface. After debonding, the samples were examined under stereoscope to evaluate the mode of failure according to the adhesive remnant index (ARI). Results: Laser irradiation significantly diminishes the shear bond strength from 10.868 MPa to 3.778 MPa for C0.5 and L0.5 groups respectively (p=0.00) and from 14.711 MPa to 4.992 MPa for C1 and L1 groups respectively (p=0.00). The shear bond strength required for debonding increased with increasing thickness of discs, but without significant difference (p=0.110). Higher ARI scores were seen in the laser groups (more cement remaining adhered to the tooth) when compared to the control groups. Conclusions: The Er,Cr:YSGG laser could be an effective and useful tool in debonding of lithium disilicate ceramic veneers as it decreases the shear bond strength required for veneer debonding.",Brazilian Journal of Oral Sciences,10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.07.011
Tuning high and low thermal expansion coefficients of Li2O–BaO–Al2O3–B2O3–SiO2/quartz LTCC composites by replacing quartz partly with α-Al2O3 or ZrO2,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Low-temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC) with adjustable coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) based on Li2O–BaO–Al2O3–B2O3–SiO2/quartz LTCC composites (glass/ceramics) have been employed in electronic packaging to address the interface thermal mismatch problem caused by different thermal expansion coefficients. In the present study, sintering behavior, phase structure, and CTE of LTCC composites is controlled by replacing quartz partly with α-Al2O3 or ZrO2. Accordingly, LTCC composites with the highest and lowest CTE values are achieved. The results show that the major phases of α-Al2O3 substituted LTCC composites are hexacelsian, β-spodumene, and virgilite. Correspondingly, CTE values are in the range of 5.67–8.62 × 10−6/°C. Whereas, ZrO2 substituted LTCC composites have exhibited increased CTE values to 12.27 to 13.2 × 10−6/°C with major phases of cristobalite, hexacelsian, and bazirite. Moreover, the negative effects of phase transformation of hexacelsian can be inhibited to a certain extent upon substitution of α-Al2O3 up to 15 wt%. This work provides suitable methods for preparing LTCC composites with gradient CTE and resolving the thermal mismatch effects at different interfaces (e.g., chip/LTCC, metal electrode/LTCC) in electronic packaging structures.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.074
Investigation through novel tool-electrode feeding approach on electrochemical discharge machining of glass,"© IMechE 2022.The electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) process is a promising advanced machining process to remove material from electrically non-conductive materials like glass, ceramics, etc. Till now fabricating a channel with a high aspect ratio on the glass surface is a challenging job as the generated gas bubbles are escaped from the machining area without developing gas film and consequent discharges. In this study, two novel approaches of tool feeding such as side feeding and bottom feeding along with usual top feeding approach have been introduced to keep the gas bubbles at the tool-electrode tip so that the development of gas film and spark discharge are taken place uniformly at the machining zone. Tool-electrode feeding at the bottom surface and at the side surface of workpiece have been employed and compared with the usual top feeding tool-electrode at the top surface of workpiece. The concentration of aqueous sodium hydroxide electrolyte and the feed rate of tool are varied for experimental investigations. The side feeding of tool-electrode has been found as the most suitable feeding approach for ECDM process. During side feeding approach, the overcut of the machined channel has been reduced by 11% as compared to that of top feeding. Also, depth of the channel has been increased significantly during machining by side feeding and bottom feeding. The tool wear has been reduced more in case of side tool-feeding approach than other two tool-feeding approaches.","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture",10.1016/B978-0-12-821867-9.00003-2
Stable borosilicate glass doped with CsPbBr3 quantum dots for efficient photodetectors,"© 2022Cesium halide lead perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have attracted great attention in the field of optoelectronics due to their excellent photoelectric characteristics. Unfortunately, the susceptibility to anion exchange, instability in air and poor water resistance of perovskite QDs hinder their practical applications. In this study, borosilicate glass doped with CsPbBr3 QDs were prepared by traditional melt quenching and heat treatment procedures, which dramatically enhances the stability of perovskite QDs. The microstructures and luminescence properties of glass ceramics were carefully investigated. Intense green emissions were observed in the QDs doped glass under the excitation of ultraviolet light. More importantly, the photodetectors based on the CsPbBr3 QDs doped glass possess a high on/off photocurrent ratio of 104. The dynamic linear response range is large and the response speed is fast under low bias working condition. The results suggest that CsPbBr3 QDs doped glasses with high emission yield could find potential applications in highly efficiency photodetectors.",Ceramics International,10.15828/2075-8545-2022-14-4-294-299
Cerium Oxide Polishes Lithium Disilicate Glass Ceramic via a Chemical–Mechanical Process,"© 2022. The Author(s).Objective The aim of the present study was to evaluate the chemical–mechanical polishing (CMP) effect of cerium oxide (ceria [CeO2]) as an abrasive to polish lithium disilicate glass ceramic. Materials and Methods For the polishing experiment, 22 lithium disilicate glass ceramic samples were prepared, polished with sandpaper using a polishing machine, their surface roughness (Ra) was measured using a profilometer, and they were randomly divided into two groups (n = 10). The samples were polished for 30 seconds with ceria paste with different ratios of deionized water:ceria by weight: 1:0.5 (C0.5) and 1:1 (C1) according to their group and the Ra values were determined. The Ra measurement was repeated after an additional 30 seconds of polishing until 120 seconds of polishing had been performed. The surface images of the postpolishing (120 seconds) samples were obtained using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate the surface morphology. For the adsorption experiment, 10 lithium disilicate glass ceramic specimens were prepared and soaked in 50-mL deionized water. After 24 hours, the specimens were removed. Each liquid sample was divided in two halves. The first half was stored and ceria particles were added into the second half. After 24 hours, the solutions were filtered. The silicon concentration in the liquid samples was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. Statistical Analysis The difference in mean Ra value between groups was analyzed using two-way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the difference in mean silica concentrations before and after adding ceria particles was analyzed using the paired t-test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Ra decreased as the ratio of ceria and polishing time increased. The surface morphology of the samples analyzed by SEM corresponded with their Ra values. The mean silicon concentration after adding ceria particles was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Conclusion Using a ceria-polishing paste to polish lithium disilicate glass ceramic generates a significantly smoother surface compared with baseline roughness. Moreover, CeO2 has a mechanical action and chemical reaction with lithium disilicate glass ceramic. Therefore, it can be used as a CMP paste to create a smooth surface.",European Journal of Dentistry,10.1007/s00289-022-04450-5
Phosphor-in-Silica-Glass: Filling the Gap between Low- and High-Brightness Solid-State Lightings,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.High-brightness phosphor-converted solid-state light (SSL) sources based on blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or laser diodes (LDs) will enable versatile optical applications other than general illumination. However, luminescence ceramics/crystals are too expensive for widespread use, while phosphor-in-glass converters suffer from low conversion efficiency at high-power-density excitation and poor chemical and thermal stabilities of low-melting glasses. Herein, an ultrathin interface (<50 nm) is reported in Lu3Al5O12:Ce3+ phosphor-in-silica-glass (LuAG:Ce-PiSG) despite being sintered at 1250 °C, endowing them with high internal quantum efficiency (>95%) and excellent stabilities. Combined experimental results and first-principles calculations reveal that the large formation energy of SiAl point defects makes the undesired interfacial reaction between aluminate garnets and silica glass intrinsically suppressed. Phosphor-converted LEDs/LDs fabricated by LuAG:Ce-PiSG exhibit high luminous efficiency (195 lm W−1 @ 20 mA) and high brightness (1914 lm @ 13.4 W mm−2), approaching the performances of their ceramic counterparts. The results not only provide a way to balance the brightness and the price for SSL sources but also unleash the potential of silica glass as an inorganic matrix for emerging optical applications.",Laser and Photonics Reviews,10.1080/10667857.2022.2120041
Up-Converted Long Persistent Luminescence from CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals in Glass,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.All-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have stimulated the enthusiasm of the research on light emitting diodes (LEDs), laser, X-ray detection, and information encryption, thanks to their excellent optical performance. Exploiting CsPbBr3 NCs with fascinating long persistent luminescence (LPL) is significantly important for expanding their potential applications. In this work, the room temperature LPL is successfully achieved in CsPbBr3 glass-ceramics (GCs) through the optical write with a femtosecond (fs) laser. The carriers captured by the generated trapping centers for the crack of non-bridged oxygen bonds in the glassy matrix are released by the thermal disturbance of room temperature. Moreover, the LPL performance is modulated flexibly for doping with La3+, Dy3+, Nd3+, and Lu3+ ions in the CsPbBr3 GCs, endowing the successful construction of a time-resolved anti-counterfeiting mode. Furthermore, the high stability and high color purity (97.04%) of the as-obtained CsPbBr3 GCs are demonstrated. The results open a window for fs laser induced perovskite with myriad applications in optical storage devices.",Laser and Photonics Reviews,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.331
Incidence of endodontic therapy after complete or partial coverage glass-ceramic restorations with a follow-up time of over 30 years: A prospective clinical study,"© 2022 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Long-term clinical data are lacking on the comparison of the incidence of endodontic therapy in adhesively luted complete and partial coverage glass-ceramic restorations, as well as on the effect of technique and clinical variables. Purpose: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to assess the long-term incidence of teeth requiring endodontic therapy after receiving either complete or partial coverage glass-ceramic restorations. Material and methods: Participants requiring single anterior complete, posterior complete, or posterior partial (inlay or onlay) coverage restoration, or a combination of these on a vital tooth were recruited from a clinical private practice. Only the participants who chose glass-ceramic partial and complete coverage restorations without the need of endodontic therapy were included in the study. The overall clinical performance of these glass-ceramic restorations was assessed by clinical factors determined at recall. The effect of various clinical parameters (type of restoration, dental arch, tooth position in the dental arch, age and sex of participant, and ceramic thickness) was evaluated by using Kaplan–Meier survival curves to account for attrition bias and other reasons for failure. The statistical significance of differences between parameters was determined by using the log rank test (α=.05). Results: A total of 1800 participants requiring 4511 glass-ceramic anterior and posterior restorations were evaluated. The mean age of the participants at the time of restoration placement was 62 (range 20 to 99 years, 710 men and 1090 women). Of 4511 restorations, 1476 were anterior complete coverage, 2119 posterior complete coverage, and 916 posterior partial coverage. Endodontic therapy after restoration placement was needed for 76 restorations (10 anterior complete, 50 posterior complete, and 16 posterior partial). The total time at risk was 50 436 years providing an estimated need for endodontic therapy risk of 0.15% per year. The estimated 35-year cumulative survival was 97.36%. The majority of endodontic treatments (67%, 52/76) occurred in the first 5 years. The estimated cumulative survival of anterior complete coverage, posterior complete coverage, posterior partial inlay, and posterior partial onlay restorations was 98.89% (n=1476, 10 endodontic treatments), 96.38% (n=2119, 50 endodontic treatments), 96.78% (n=553, 11 endodontic treatments), and 98.53% (n=363, 5 endodontic treatments), respectively. Statistically significant differences occurred between anterior complete coverage, posterior complete coverage, and posterior partial coverage inlay restorations, with a higher incidence in posterior complete coverage and posterior partial inlay restorations (P<.05). First molars had the highest rate of endodontic therapy after restoration in both arches. Age and restoration thickness were significant factors, recording statistically higher number of endodontic treatments in participants >52 years and restorations with all surfaces ≥1 mm (P<.05). Other clinical variables, dental arch and sex of the participants, were not significantly related to endodontic treatments (P>.05). Conclusions: The clinical performance of 4511 units over 30 years in service was excellent, with the estimated cumulative survival of 97.36%. Posterior complete coverage and posterior partial inlay restorations had a significantly higher need for endodontic therapy than anterior complete coverage restorations. Their overall clinical performance relative to endodontic treatment was excellent with a cumulative survival of 96.38% and 96.78% over 30 years. There was no difference in the endodontic treatment rate between posterior complete and partial coverage restorations. Thickness of the restoration affected the endodontic treatment rate, with ≥1 mm resulting in higher incidence. The age of the participants influenced the endodontic treatment rate, with higher incidence in the >52-year age group. Other confounding clinical variables did not have a significant effect on the endodontic treatment rate.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1088/1742-6596/2298/1/012013

It was focused on the mechanical behavior between YSZ-glass composite seals and Fe–16Cr alloy under various thermal cycles by shear force testing and tensile force testing. The shear strength and the tensile strength between H4-20 seals and Fe–16Cr alloy were higher than that of H1-20. Two composite seals differed in characteristic temperature, viscosity, and crystalline phase with possible impacts on the joint strength. The interfacial composition between H1-20 and Fe–16Cr alloy was different from that of H4-20. Based on examination results, four possible fracture modes were proposed to illustrate the failure mechanism between composite seals and alloy.",Ceramics International,10.1111/ijag.16609
Angiogenesis induction by bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Bioactive glasses (BGs) have an outstanding place in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies. These synthetic materials were historically used for the treatment of bone and dental tissues; recent studies have proved their effectiveness in managing soft tissue injuries as well. BGs exhibit several biological properties in favor of tissue healing, including the ability to attach to tissues and promoting cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The release of therapeutic ions from BG structure into the surrounding environment is commonly regarded as the main mechanism associated with their biological properties. The ability to induce new blood vessel formation (i.e., angiogenesis) is among the most interesting characteristics of BGs, which may be beneficial for accelerating tissue wound healing. This capacity can be easily improved by adding specific concentrations of angiogenesis-inducing elements (e.g., copper and cobalt) to the basic formulation of BGs. All categories of BGs, including silicate-, phosphate-, and borate-based glasses, were evaluated and successfully doped with proangiogenic elements. In addition, BGs are known as suitable platforms for loading and delivery of a wide range of proangiogenic bioactive molecules like growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines. Utilizing BGs in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds may be considered for the next generation of proangiogenic bone tissue substitutes.",Biomaterials for Vasculogenesis and Angiogenesis,10.1109/FLEPS53764.2022.9781557
Fillers for polymer composite materials,"© Mazitova A.K., Zaripov I.I., Aminova G.K., Ovod M.V., Suntsova N.L., 2022.Introduction. For the production of building products made of PVC, compositions are used that, along with the poly-mer, include additives: plasticizers, stabilizers, modifiers. This leads to a decrease in the chlorine content in the composition and increases the flammability of the productitself. Therefore, nanoparticles of various fillers are added into the compositions. Fillers inPVC compositions (more often inorganic, less often organic substances) are solid additives that differ from the polymer matrix in chemical composition and structure.In most cases, the main function of fillers is to reduce flammability and cut costs of the products obtained, in some cases they serve to impart or improve the following properties: reducing plasticizer absorption, changing in dielectric properties, increasing rigidity and hardness, reducing noise transmission, reducing toxicity of combustion products. Main part. Fillers are classified according to various criteria. According to the state of aggregation, they are divided into gaseous, liquid and solid. By their nature, they are divided into organic and inorganic; according to the source of receipt – reinforcing, strengthen-ing, reinforcing, neutral; bythe size, particle shape and structure – into 4 main types: dispersed (powder); fibrous (fibers, threads, bundles, etc.); sheet (film) with a given structure (fabrics, paper, tapes, sheets, films, nets); volumetric (framework) with a continuous three-dimensional structure (bulk fabrics, felt, skeletal and porous frameworks). The most commonly used solid fillers, which are also called dispersed. The introduction of dispersed fillers into polymer composite materials (PCM) is more appropriate for creating mass-produced materials, more technologically advanced, with a low level of strength characteristics. Dispersed fillers are introduced into thermoplastics with high fracture energy to reduce their cost, increase stiffness and compressive strength, and improve their technological characteristics during processing. At the same time, their tensile strength and impact strength decrease due to reduc-tion in the proportion of polymer in the filled composition. The introduction of solid and hard particles leads to an increase in the elastic modulus (E); and soft, elastic or gaseous fillers – to its decrease. According to the mechanism of action, dispersed fillers can be divided into inert ones, which do not affect the properties of the matrix and are introduced into its composition to reduce the cost of the composition, and active ones. Dispersed fillers are divided into mineral, organic and metal. The commonest of those are minerals. Conclusion. Thus, at present, there are a large number of substances and materials used as fillers and making it possible to obtain PCM with low shrinkage and shape stability of products, high mechanical properties and the necessary set of special proper-ties. Due to fillers, PCM can compete with other materials such as glass, ceramics and even metal in most areas of human activity.",Nanotechnologies in Construction,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.194
"Study the microstructure, optical, mechanical, and dielectric characteristics of Cu2+/Zn2+-codoped PVA for CUT-OFF laser filters","© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Recent research aims to study the structural, optical, mechanical, and dielectric characteristics of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) filled with Cu2+/Zn2+ doped-PVA polymeric composite films. Cu2+/ Zn2+/PVA films were prepared by the solution casting method and examined by different techniques such as XRD, UV–Vis, tensile testing, and dielectric measurements. PVA’s crystallinity is affected by the interaction of the PVA’s main chain and metal ions doping. The Cu2+-ions codoped Zn/PVA composite films reveal the absorbance spectrums in the visible region due to the surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) phenomenon for Cu-particles. It is found that the mechanical characteristics were improved, where the strength, Young’s modulus, and ductility were increased through the increase of Cu2+-ions content in Zn/PVA composite films. The dielectric measurement of the as-prepared polymeric composite films has investigated and demonstrated a highly attractive dielectric constant for the polymeric dielectric media. The obtained dielectric behaviors, alternating-current conductivity, and dielectric modulus depended on the Cu2+-ions content. The power output is reduced by increasing Cu2+-ions content, and therefore, the optical limiting of polymeric films becomes better. Finally, Cu2+-ions doped Zn/PVA composite films showed unique properties to be used as flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices, especially in dielectric media, CUT-OFF laser filters for biomedical laser applications.

The effect of SiO2/LiO2 ratio on the mechanical and biological properties of lithium metasilicate glass ceramic,"© 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Initial lithium silicate glass frits with different SiO2/Li2O ratio were prepared by the melting method. In this study, the obtained glass frits were hot-pressed at different temperatures of 550, 650 and 750°C; however, only samples sintered at 750°C were sintered and densified. The properties of the obtained lithium metasilicate glass ceramics (LMSGC) were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, microstructural observation, wettability and cytotoxicity. The rise of SiO2/Li2O ratio resulted in the enhancement of wettability and hardness and less cell viability. The properties of LMSGC could be tailored by changing the SiO2/Li2O ratio. So, the SiO2/Li2O ratio is an important parameter in LMSGC fabrication for dental applications.",Materials Technology,10.3290/j.jad.b3240691
Controlling the microstructure and properties of lithium disilicate glass-ceramics by adjusting the content of MgO,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.In order to obtain lithium disilicate glass-ceramics for dental restoration with both high strength and high translucency, lithium disilicate glass-ceramics with different MgO contents were prepared by melt-casting and heat treatment method. The effects of MgO content on the crystallization temperature, microstructure and flexural strength of lithium disilicate glass-ceramics were investigated. The results indicate that Mg2+ exists in the form of [MgO4] in the network of lithium disilicate glass-ceramics when the MgO content is 0.56 mol% (M0.56), which is beneficial to increasing the homogeneity and thermal stability of the glass system, and short rod-like lithium disilicate crystals can be formed after heat treatment at 840°C. Thus, the obtained lithium disilicate glass-ceramics exhibit excellent comprehensive performance, with the flexural strength being 312 ± 23 MPa, and the average transmittance of visible light being 37.3% (d = 1.62 mm). Especially, the glass-ceramic sample shows better translucency than the commercially available products.

Effect of starting materials of nucleation agents on crystallization of CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 glass,"© 2022 The Authors. International Journal of Applied Glass Science published by American Ceramics Society and Wiley Periodicals LLC.The effect of the starting materials of the nucleation agents for glass–ceramics (GCs) was explored. The number of hexagonal platy particles of metastable-CaAl2Si2O8 in CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 (CAS) GCs was increased by changing the sizes of molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and carbon particles used as starting materials of the nucleation agents. X-ray diffraction patterns indicated that all of GC specimens display reflections attributed to metastable-CaAl2Si2O8 solely. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that, compared with the CAS GC with precipitated hexagonal platy particles of metastable-CaAl2Si2O8 (CAS GC-H) prepared using MoO3 particles with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 3.5 m2/g and 10–50 μm carbon particles, CAS GC-Hs prepared using MoO3 particles with a BET surface area of 1.2 m2/g or carbon fibers 10–50 μm in length and ∼5 μm in diameter resulted in approximately a twofold increase in the number of platy particles of metastable-CaAl2Si2O8 and a decrease in the average particle size from 13 to 11 μm. The microstructures of the CAS GC-Hs are closer looks. In addition, no major differences in volume fractions estimated using the binarized SEM images are observed between those GC specimens. These results indicated that the starting materials of nucleation agents affect the crystallization of CAS GCs.",International Journal of Applied Glass Science,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.171
Flexible all-organic composites with ultrahigh energy storage density for wearable electronics,"© 2022 IEEE.A novel approach to fabricate flexible energy storage ultracapacitors is introduced in this work. Dielectric polymers have been used in the fabrication of energy storage capacitors. To improve the energy storage performance of the dielectric polymers, composite approach has been extensively studied in last two decades with the focus on inorganic-polymer composites. Here. composites of polymer and organic small molecules are studied. The all-organic composites are flexible, even better than the dielectric polymer itself. More interestingly, the energy storage performance is enhanced. For example, energy storage density of the all-organic composites of P(VDF-CTFE) and silane is more than 64% higher than P(VDF-CTFE) itself. All these make the all-organic composites great candidates for the development of flexible energy storage devices for wearable electronics.","FLEPS 2022 - IEEE International Conference on Flexible and Printable Sensors and Systems, Proceedings",10.1080/02670844.2022.2111853
Effects of Er3+ and/or Cr3+ doping on crystallization activation energy and fluorescence properties of transparent ZnGa2O4 glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Er3+ and/or Cr3+ doped transparent ZnGa2O4 glass-ceramics were successfully obtained by one-step heat treatment. The results showed that Er3+ ions can enrich around ZnGa2O4 crystal to reduce the crystallization activation energy and promote the growth of ZnGa2O4 crystal. Cr3+ ions may successfully occupy the Ga3+ sites in the ZnGa2O4 lattice but will increase crystallization activation energy and inhibit the growth of the ZnGa2O4 crystal. Before and after crystallization, the coordination-field intensity of Cr3+ ions increased from 2.17 to 2.86, resulting in the peak position of its emission spectra moving from 850 to 688 nm. By excitation at 378 nm, the precursor glass co-doped with Er3+ and Cr3+ ions only showed the characteristic emission peaks belonging to Er3+ ions. After heat treatment, the characteristic emission peaks belonging to Er3+ and Cr3+ ions existed simultaneously, and the emission color changed from green to yellow. By excitation at 980 nm, there were only characteristic emission peaks belonging to Er3+ ions of the Er3+/Cr3+ co-doped glasses before and after heat treatment. The results showed that the Er3+ and/or Cr3+ doped ZnGa2O4 glass-ceramics have adjustable luminescence ability and show potential application value in the field of luminescence display.",Ceramics International,10.1109/ICLO54117.2022.9840279
MicroCT evaluation for CAD/CAM occlusal veneer fit using two materials and three cement space settings,"© 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica. All rights reserved.This study was aimed to evaluate the fit of occlusal veneer restoration for two CAD/CAM materials with different cement space settings, using microCT scans. Sixty resin dies were made and divided into two groups (n=30) according to the materials, (I): Hybrid all-ceramic, and (II): zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic. Each group was subdivided into three subgroups (n=10) according to the cement space parameters (30, 40, and 50 μm). Occlusal veneers for the six subgroups were milled. A circle with 20 different sections was placed at the center of every scanned specimen to measure four different locations (Occlusal, Axial, Marginal, and Absolute marginal discrepancy). Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA at a 0.05 level of significance. There was no statistically significant effect of material type on the mean values of internal and marginal gaps for the three cement space parameters (P>0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the occlusal and axial gap between the cement space parameters, furthermore, there were statistically significant differences in marginal gap distances and absolute marginal discrepancies (P>0.05). Hybrid all-ceramic showed smaller marginal and internal discrepancies than zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic without statistically significant differences, and, for both materials, 50 μm cement space significantly improved the marginal fit and absolute marginal discrepancy.",Brazilian Dental Journal,10.1109/ICLO54117.2022.9839804

To view a copy of this license, visit http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/or send a letter to Creative Commons, PO Box 1866, Mountain View, CA 94042, USAPurpose: To evaluate the effect of two surface conditioning methods, namely conventional hydrofluoric acid vs self-etching primer, and the application of adhesive on the bond strength of composite cement to CAD/CAM glass-ceramics. Materials and Methods: Blocks (N = 96) (12 x 10 x 2.5 mm) were manufactured, 24 for each tested ceramic type: lithium silicate ceramic (LS), polymer-infiltrated ceramic (PIC), leucite-reinforced feldspathic ceramic (FD), and lithiumdisilicate glass-ceramic (LD). For bond strength testing, 64 blocks were randomly divided into 16 groups (4 blocks per group) according to the following factors: ceramic: 4 levels; etching: 2 levels (HFS: hydrofluoric acid + silane or Monobond Etch & Prime [MEP]); and adhesive application: 2 levels, with (signified as A) and without. Then for each group, 15 composite cement cylinders (AllCem Dual, FGM) were built up. All specimens were subjected to thermocycling (10,000 cycles) and to shear bonding strength testing (SBS) (100 kgf, 0.5 mm/min). Mean shear stresses (MPa) were statistically analyzed by three-way ANOVA, Tukey’s test, and Weibull analysis. Results: The mean bond strength of group PIC-HFS-A (28.45 ± 7.6 MPa) was significantly higher than that of groups LS-HFS-A (12.11 ± 2.7 MPa) and FDHFSA (20.86 ± 2.0 MPa). Group PIC-HFS bond strength (25.02 ± 6.5 MPa) was significantly higher only when compared to group LS-HFS (15.82 ± 4.4 MPa). The LS group presented lower SBS compared to all other groups. No significant differences were found between HFS and MEP surface treatments. Conclusion: Surface treatment with MEP promotes adhesion similar to that of HFS. Additional application of adhesive after the surface treatments did not improve the bond strength.",Journal of Adhesive Dentistry,10.1109/ICLO54117.2022.9839889
Design of high isolation CWDM narrow-band pass filter,"© 2022 IEEE.According to the relation between the transmission characteristics and wavelength of coarse wavelength division multiplexer (CWDM), the crosstalk between each channel is considered to lead to the increase of bit error rate between each transmitted signal. The CWDM narrow-band pass filter is coated on glass-ceramics substrate, so that the signal light in 1260-1620nm band has high isolation degree and low cross talk coefficient, and the transmission isolation degree of adjacent channel and non-adjacent channel of reflection band is greater than 40dB.

Study on preparation of glass-ceramics from multiple solid waste and coupling mechanism of heavy metals,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Solid wastes, such as municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI FA) and tailings, contain a large number of harmful components, which makes harmless and recycling treatment a challenge. Through high-temperature reconstruction, the solid waste containing heavy metals is prepared into glass-ceramics, which is an effective method to realize the harmless and resource utilization of solid waste. In this work, glass-ceramics were successfully prepared by using MSWI FA, waste glass, and lead-zinc tailings. The utilization rate of solid waste reached 91.74%. The coupling mechanism of heavy metals with Fe as the dominant factor and Zn, Cu, and Pb coexisting was explored. The results showed that the critical threshold of sintering temperature was 1000 °C. The properties of glass-ceramics can be greatly optimized when the temperature was higher than 1000 °C. Fe played a leading role in the migration and solidification process. Because of its higher displacement capacity, Fe was preferentially solidified in the form of hedenbergite and magnetite. Zn, Cu, and Pb solidified in the form of (Mg,Fe,Zn,Cu)Fe2O4 and Pb2+ respectively. The order of stabilization effect was Fe > Zn > Cu > Pb. All leaching concentrations of heavy metals were lower than the standard threshold, even if the heavy metals reached 20 wt%.",Ceramics International,10.1109/ICLO54117.2022.9839754
The harnessing of the waste arising from Y-TZP dental ceramics manufactured by CAD/CAM to be used as alternative dental materials,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.A large amount of yttria-stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) waste is produced during the manufacture of dental prostheses by the CAD/CAM milling process. This work investigated the recycling and processing of zirconia waste powder (ZWP), generated from the manufacture of dental prostheses (CAD/CAM milling process). The physical and mechanical characteristics of the bodies produced with ZWP were evaluated. The received ZWP was calcined at 500 °C and de-agglomerated with a roll jar mill under different experimental conditions. The grinding condition with a relation between grinding medium mass (GM) and ZWP mass of 13 and a milling time of 90 min presented the best results. This procedure produced ZWP with the smallest mean particle size (0.4 μm) and the lowest tetragonal-monoclinic transformation (16.9%). The water absorption, apparent porosity, bulk density, and mechanical properties were evaluated from ZWP non-deagglomerated and ZWP de-agglomerated after sintering at 1300 °C, 1400 °C, and 1500 °C. ZWP de-agglomerated samples reached bulk density, microhardness, and flexural strength values of 5.8 ± 0.1 g/cm3, 1523 ± 173 HV, and 342.8 ± 66.7 MPa, respectively. The achieved values of bulk density and microhardness were similar to those of commercial ZrO2 bodies processed under the same conditions, 6.0 ± 0.1 g/cm3 and 1412 ± 70 HV, respectively. But flexural strength of ZWP bodies was lower than that of commercial ZrO2, 680.5 ± 96.0 MPa. However, the achieved strength is higher than that observed for porcelain and glass-ceramic dental materials used for single-unit anterior or posterior prostheses (<200 MPa), which depicts the ZWP potential as an alternative low-cost and high-strength material in ceramic prostheses.",Ceramics International,10.1109/ICLO54117.2022.9840001
Abrasion-resistant CMAS glass-ceramic coatings incorporated with B4C particles,"© 2022 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.One of the most significant mechanical characteristics of glass-ceramic coatings (GCCS) is abrasion resistance, which is particularly pertinent when contamination from the coated metallic surface is not desired. The influence of incorporating boron carbide (B4C) as a hard particle into the CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 GCC on the abrasion resistance was examined in this study. A PEI Abraser was used to evaluate the abrasion resistance over 5000 cycles, with mass loss recorded every 1000 cycles. Mass loss following the abrasion test was observed to decrease when the amount of added B4C was increased, indicating that the abrasion resistance was enhanced by B4C addition. The addition of 16 wt-% B4C has had the strongest interface among the matrix/B4C particles, resulting in higher abrasion resistance due to reduced crack formation and porosity, and yielded a decrease in mass loss of about 54%, colour change of <2 in terms of ΔE and gloss change about 40%.",Surface Engineering,10.1109/ICLO54117.2022.9840272

Modeling of Modulus of elasticity of Nano-Composite Materials: Review and Evaluation,"© 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.To improve the mechanical properties of polymer, the mineral particles are added to produce composite material. For example, the mineral particles are added to polymer to improve the stiffness of polymer because of the higher stiffness of mineral particles. When the micron-sized particles are used in composite usually cause a reduction in impact resistance. On the other hand, adding the nano scale minerals leads to improve the impact and wear properties of the composite materials (nanocomposites). Several factors effect on the mechanical properties of nanocomposites like adhesion between the polymer and nanoparticles. If the interfacial deboning of particles from the matrix decreases, the tensile strength of the composite could be reduced.

"Structural, thermal and superconducting properties of Ag2O-doped YBa2Cu3O7-x composite materials","© 2022A composite material with superconducting properties, consisting of YBa2Cu3O7-x doped with Ag2O, was obtained after 233 h of sintering at 960 °C and followed by a special cooling program in oxygen atmosphere. Preferential orientation of YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO-123) crystallites was evidenced through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Small increase of c parameter for orthorhombic YBCO-123 crystalline unit cell together with a slight decrease of oxygen content (7-x) versus Ag content, were encountered. The dimensions of YBCO-123 crystallites are dependent on Ag content. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) during heating in flowing air atmosphere from room temperature (RT) to 1100 °C, showed that total mass loss is depending on Ag content. The cooling (from 1100 °C to RT, in air atmosphere) endows optimal oxygen accumulation only for 0 and 5 wt% Ag, while final masses for 10 and 20 wt% of Ag content, are more than 10% less. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed peritectic melting points for YBa2Cu3O7-x dependent on Ag percentage. DSC graphics also highlighted the endothermic effects: silver melting; melting and decomposition of Ag2O (in 225.81–345.12 °C temperature range) only for 10 and 20 wt%, but completely missing in the case of 5 wt% Ag content. We concluded that some of Cu sites from YBCO-123 superconductor were substituted by Ag ions.

CURING TEMPERATURES EFFECT ON EXPLOSIVE SPALLING IN ALUMINA CEMENT-BASED CONCRETES,"© 2022 ISEC Press.Alumina cement (AC) based refractory concretes are the primary building materials for steel, cement, glass, ceramics, and chemical industries. Those advanced materials are efficient at high operation temperatures (up to 1500 °C), conforming to thermal shock and mechanical and slag resistance requirements. For these purposes, fine-grade or ultra-fine powders partially replace the cement. However, that increases the material density and, depending on the first heating cycle regime, the evaporated steam pressure can cause cracking and even explosive spalling of the concrete. The coarse aggregates and temperature-melting fibers can regulate the water evaporation process—the melted fibers form micro-channels, allowing excessive water removal from the heated material. However, the concrete curing conditions also affect the hydration products’ structure (density) and chemical composition, altering the water removal kinetics from the refractory material. This investigation focuses on the hardening conditions’ effect on the hydration process and explosive spalling resistance of the AC refractory concretes. The research object is the refractory concrete with a 130 MPa target compressive strength and 7wt% of AC. The alternative mixture contains polypropylene fibers (0.1wt%). The cylinder samples were cured at different temperatures, representing “normal” (20 °C), “summer” (35 °C), and “winter” (10 °C) conditions. The test results demonstrate the fiber efficiency in preventing the spalling failure characteristic of the samples produced without fibers. On the other hand, the curing temperature was the essential parameter, affecting the water removal kinetics of the refractory material with fibers—the “winter” concrete samples tend to explosive spalling due to the formed hydrates.",Proceedings of International Structural Engineering and Construction,10.1111/ijag.16601
Optimization in Mathematics Modeling and Processing of New Type Silicate Glass Ceramics,"© 2022 Ling Qin, published by Sciendo 2022.This paper applies the Gaussian random field to the mathematical modeling of new-Type silicate glass-ceramic trachoma detection. The article established a three-dimensional numerical model of trachoma structure based on the anisotropic random field. Then, the open and closed operations in mathematical morphology are used to obtain the strongly connected boundaries of the new-Type silicate glass-ceramic trachoma image. At the same time, the connected domain detection in binary morphology is used to remove the noise to obtain the target image of the silicate glass-ceramic pore.

Influence of nanosized defects on photoluminescence efficiency of Er3+ ions co-doped with Au2O3 in a lead boroselenate glass ceramic system: a novel approach using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy,© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.This study consists of the results of an investigation into the influence of the free-volume space (fv) defects on luminescence efficiency (LE) of erbium ions in Au2O3-doped PbO–B2O3–SeO2 (PBS) glass ceramics. Glass ceramics containing fixed concentrations of Er3+ ions and varied concentrations of Au2O3 were synthesized. X-ray diffraction studies indicated that the samples contained Au2(SeO3)3 crystalline phase and nano gold metallic particles. The concentration of defects entrenched in the glass ceramics estimated in terms of Au2O3 content using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy measurement indicated the highest content in the glass ceramic containing 0.075 mol% of Au2O3. Optical absorption and the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the glass ceramics were studied in the visible region. The observed increase of PL efficiency was attributed to the enhanced concentration of free-volume imperfections in the samples. A perfect correlation could be achieved between the free-volume fraction and the PL efficiency of erbium ions in these glass ceramics.,Luminescence,10.1016/j.matpr.2022.07.131
Self-protection systems for domestic induction heating based on ferromagnetic materials with low Curie temperature,"© 2022 IEEE.In cooking processes, regardless of the technology used (glass-ceramic, induction or gas), it is necessary to have a protection system that can prevent the cooktop from burning in case of forgetting or abandoning the cookware during the process. In this paper it is presented a design of a self-protection system against over-temperatures, for domestic induction heating applications, based on electrical measurements. It is proposed the fabrication of cooking vessels using materials with electro-magnetic properties that change with a predefined temperature and whose changes can be detected with the current induction cooktops on the market. The use of this method does not require any additional sensor, as opposed to other systems that use different types of sensors to detect the temperature, which would reduce the complexity and costs of the induction cooktop. The different materials and designs proposed for use in cooking vessels have been experimentally tested and it has been defined an impedance threshold value, to be implemented in the control system, for which the system can consider that the safety temperature has been exceeded.",IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics,10.1088/1742-6596/2198/1/012056
Machine learning on thermographic images for the detection and classification of damage on composites,"© COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Composite materials unarguably represent the important structure parts in most modern transport applications such as the aerospace sector. One area that shows great potential in the battle against aircraft structural damage and the diagnosis of composite materials. Very often, detection and diagnosis tools offer a valuable and quick mechanism to the analysts and assist them in the monitoring of the health integrity of the composite materials. Although numerous initiatives to develop damage detection techniques and make operations more efficient were launched, there is still an on-going need to develop/improve upon the existing methods. In this work, Pulsed Thermography (PT) technique was used to acquire healthy and faulty datasets from specially designed composite samples of the same dimensions (300 mm x 300 mm x 2 mm) with three different geometries (planar, curved and trapezoidal). Three plates from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) were tested. The same defects distribution was first introduced to the different samples and the variation of surface temperature over time, and the flow of transient heat generated through an energy stimulus in the samples were then monitored. A machine learning (A Cubic Spine Support Vector Machine) based technique was applied to the resulting thermographic images in order to detect and classify damage on composite structures. The proposed classification model was evaluated for its performance using the common metrics such as the overall accuracy, sensitivity, precision, specificity, etc. It was concluded that the classification approach could provide a reliable estimate of composite material conditions and eventually could lead to 'go/no-go' decisions.",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1088/1742-6596/2198/1/012052
Numerical Analysis of Unidirectional GFRP Composite Mechanical Response Subjected to Tension Load using Finite Element Method,"© The Authors 2022. Published by University Malaysia Pahang Publishing. This is an open access article under the CC BY licenseComposite material is a well-known structural material which is increasingly adopted as an engineering structure material. Glass fiber reinforced polymer offers the lightweight and high strength characteristics that is required for the modern industry, such as aviation, automotive, wind power, and marine technology. One of the important mechanical characteristics of the composite materials are the tensile properties, because it is well known as the material strength. Therefore, the investigation of mechanical response on the glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) tensile test using numerical analysis is important for the estimation of structural response of the GFRP complex structure, such as boat construction. The objective of this research is to assess and estimate the mechanical response of the GFRP composite material subjected to tension load using finite element method. The linear transversely isotropic model is developed to estimate the unidirectional glass fiber GFRP with the configuration of fiber orientation angles of 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90°. The results show that FE simulation are capable to detect the specimen response during the tensile test. The maximum discrepancy of the estimated stress strain diagram is about 16.5% to 32% compared to experimental data. The larger orientation angle has shown the larger discrepancy value. It is found that the increment of discrepancy value is generated by the nonlinearity behavior of the material due to the domination of polymer material behavior on the large orientation angle. Otherwise, the FE models have estimated accurately the ultimate strength, maximum displacement and fracture load. It can be concluded that the linear transversely isotropic model is adequately accepted as the estimation method of the GFRP composite structure response",International Journal of Automotive and Mechanical Engineering,"10.3290/j.ijcd.b2585503,"

A critical review of bioactive glasses and glass–ceramics in cancer therapy,"© 2022 The Authors. International Journal of Applied Glass Science published by American Ceramics Society and Wiley Periodicals LLC.There is an ongoing profound shift in using glass as a primarily passive material to one that instills active properties. We believe and demonstrate that bioactive glasses (BGs) and glass–ceramics (BGCs) as functional biomaterials for cancer therapy can transform the world of healthcare in the 21st century. Melt/gel-derived BGs and BGCs can carry many exotic elements, including less common rare-earth, and trigger highly efficient anticancer properties via the combination of radiotherapy, photothermal therapy, magnetic hyperthermia, along with drug or therapeutic ions delivery. The addition of these dopants modifies the bioactivity, imparts novel functionalities, and induces specific biological effects that are not achievable using other classes of biomaterials. In this paper, we have briefly reviewed and discussed the current knowledge on promising compositions, processing parameters, and applications of BGs and BGCs in treating cancer.

Features of crystallization of cast glass-ceramic spinel-pyroxene materials under non-equilibrium conditions,"© 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.Morphometrical parameters of the structural components of the glass-ceramic materials obtained from the melts are critical for the desired properties; these parameters largely depend upon the crystallization sequence. The objective of the present work is to study the features of crystallization of the glass-ceramic spinel-pyroxene materials from the melt under non-equilibrium conditions. The research uses a melt of the following composition, weight %: SiO2 - 45; MgO - 15.5; CaO - 12.5; Al2O3 - 15.5; FeO - 6.5; Fe2O3 - 3.5; TiO2 - 1; Na2O+K2O - 3; CaF2 - 1.5; Cr2O3 - 1.5, and the material obtained through its crystallization and solidification. Two types of samples were obtained; both were subjected to solidification in sand-clay molds but at different process parameters of crystallization, the cooling rate of the molds right after casting being 100 and 200 °C/h, respectively. The study of peculiarities of formation of the structure of cast glass-ceramic spinel-pyroxene materials under non-equilibrium conditions has established that: (1) the morphological parameters of structural components, in particular, spinels, under non-equilibrium crystallization are influenced not only by the cooling rate, but also by the conditions of solidification (contact with air, with mold, no contact); the milder is the mode of crystallization, that is the lower is the cooling rate, the higher is the density of spinel distribution and the size of the largest components; (2) when crystallizing the casts in the mold, five typical zones are distinguished: a zone of the direct air contact; a transition zone between air cooling and cast center; a zone without contact with external environment; a transition zone between the cast center and the zone of contact with the mold's wall; a zone of direct contact with the mold; (3) the length of some of the zones depends on the mode of crystallization: the less equilibrium it has, the shorter is the no-contact zone and the longer are the zones of contact with air and mold; (4) there is a mechanism that causes microzoning of the structure: during crystallization, a specific critical size of spinel is achieved when the spinel acquires its own ""zone of influence""; that is, a particular area of the melt proportional to the size of the spinel becomes a material for formation of a shell around the spinel by way of epitaxial growth",Procedia Structural Integrity,10.15407/fm29.02.228
Simulation Prediction and Forming Quality Control of Hemming Structure with Dissimilar Materials Oriented to Process Chain,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Multi-material mixed-use has become an important way to realize autobody lightweight. However, due to the difference of material properties, the structure is prone to material mismatch when using thin and dissimilar materials. In this paper, a deformation compensation method oriented to the process chain is proposed to eliminate the quality defects. Based on the simulation and prediction of the process chain, the final deformation is advanced to the spreading preparation stage to realize the geometric pre-compensation of the structure. Firstly, in the spreading and hemming stage, the prediction of hemming with adhesive was realized by establishing SPH (Smoothed particle method)-FEM (Finite element method) coupling model. Then, a coupled thermal-chemical-structural model is established to predict the curing deformation. Finally, the deformed dimension is fed back to the spreading stage to achieve the deformation compensation. The results show that the multi-field coupling model can achieve accurate prediction, and the structural deformation is reduced to more than 95%. This provides a basis for material matching and optimization of the whole process chain.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,10.1016/j.jre.2021.11.010
Glass-Ceramics from Trachyte Rock- Limestone or Magnesite,"© 2022, The Author(s).Inexpensive sintered glass-ceramic glaze was prepared from a mixture of Egyptian trachyte with either limestone or magnesite. A represented trachyte rock was pulverized to powder (<0.083 mm) and also both limestone and magnesite. The well mixed batches were melted near 1450 °C/3 h temperature then the glass melt was quenched in water, dried, pulverized to powder and finally shaped in moulds. The sintering process of the pre-shaped glasses, within 1000-1100 °C range, gave augite and olivine in case of trachyte-magnesite whereas wollastonite and Ca-olivine in case of trachyte-limestone. However, cristobalite was developed in both cases. The microstructures in both cases showed glassy matrix scattered with submicron and nano-size crystals either in irregular shape in case of trachyte-limestone or clear crystals in case of trachyte-magnesite. The densities of the sintered samples were in the range of 2.36 and 2.57 g/cm3 in case of the trachyte-limestone and 2.36 and 2.64 g/cm3 in case of the trachyte-magnesite. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and the hardness of the sintered glass-ceramic were in the range of 6.2-8.5 × 10−6 °C−1 and 440-563 GPa respectively. However, the CTE values decreased in case of trachyte-limestone whereas the hardness values were high in case of trachyte-magnesite.

Synthesis and optical properties of novel Gd3+-doped BaZn2(PO4)2 glass-ceramics for radiation detection applications,"© 2021 Chinese Society of Rare Earths45P2O5–15BaO–25ZnO–15B2O3 glasses doped with different concentrations (0 mol%, 0.1 mol%, 0.25 mol%, 0.5 mol%, and 0.75 mol%) of Gd3+ were prepared by a melt-quenching method and treated to fabricate glass-ceramics containing BaZn2(PO4)2 crystals by controllable crystallization. The structural, optical, and dosimetric properties were investigated. FTIR spectra indicate that the glasses are composed of [PO4], [BO3], and [BO4] basic structural units. The XRD pattern analysis indicates that the samples contain BaZn2(PO4)2 crystals. In the photoluminescence (PL) spectra, two emission bands are observed at 307 and 313 nm due to the 6P5/2→8S7/2 and 6P7/2→8S7/2 transitions of Gd3+, respectively. The OSL dosimetric properties of glass-ceramics were studied further under beta radiation of 90Sr. The optimal Gd3+ doping concentration of 0.5 mol% was determined. The fading of the OSL signal shows that the CW-OSL signal of Gd3+-doped BaZn2(PO4)2 glass-ceramics decays by about 58.95% within 120 h, and the intensity remains stable thereafter. The thermoluminescence (TL) curve has three peaks at 164, 240, and 344 °C. Minimum detectable dose (MDD) of the 0.5 mol% Gd3+-doped BaZn2(PO4)2 glass-ceramics was calculated as 0.675 mGy. The samples also exhibit good signal reusability and a broad linear dose–response range (0.3–500 Gy). Results show the excellent dosimetric properties of Gd3+-doped BaZn2(PO4)2 glass-ceramics and their potential application in radiation dosimetry.",Journal of Rare Earths,10.1117/12.2622425
Carbothermal reduction of red mud for iron extraction and sodium removal,"© 2022 Huaixuan Feng et al., published by De Gruyter.In this work, the technology of carbothermic reduction was used to extract iron and remove sodium from red mud. The effect of various parameters like reduction time, temperature, and basicity on melting separation and de-alkalization was studied. At the optimum reduction temperature of 1,450°C, the basicity of 1.5, and reduction time of 12 min, the metallization rate and sodium removal reach 96.63 and 90.62%, respectively. Melting and separating conditions gradually improve with the temperature increasing from 1,350 to 1,450°C. At high basicity (R = 2), the condition of melting and separation is poor due to a large amount of Ca2Al2SiO7 produced, which has a high melting point. Subsequently, in order to explore the aggregation state of iron ions under different basicities, the microstructure of pellets was observed by scanning electron microscopy. It was found that when the basicity is 1.5, the aggregation degree of iron particles significantly increases. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the reduced pellets indicated that at different basicities, the final phase composition of reduced pellets is mainly Ca2Al2SiO7, which is the basic material for preparing cement materials and glass ceramics.

Structural and impedance spectroscopic investigations of eco-friendly alkali phosphoborate glass–ceramics containing zirconium ion,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Glass–ceramics with novel composition xZrO2.7P2O5.19CaO.24Na2O.(50-x)B2O3 (x = 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mol%) have been synthesized using melt quench technique. The synthesized compositions were characterized and analyzed by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, infrared absorption, and impedance spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction profiles of prepared samples confirm the existence of phases corresponding to Na3Ca6(PO4)5 crystal (with crystallite size ~ 23 nm). Infrared absorbance spectra reveal the presence of phosphate and borate units (PO3, PO4, BO3, BO4) in the glass matrix. Different dielectric parameters such as dielectric loss, electric modulus, and tangent loss were evaluated. Their variations with temperature and frequency confirm the non- Debye relaxation behavior of prepared samples. A phenomenal description of the capacitive behavior was studied by considering the circuit having a parallel combination of constant phase element and bulk resistance. The conduction is found to be governed by overlapping large polaron tunneling (OLPT) and follow OLPT model. The results indicate that ZrO2 substituted alkali phosphoborate glass–ceramics can be used as eco-friendly and safe dielectric materials.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,10.1117/12.2624442
Detection Method of Power Saving Mode of Household Photovoltaic-Storage Integrated Power Supply,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Nowadays, more importance has been attached to the energy consumption of household energy storage inverters. This paper proposes a design scheme of original-auxiliary dual power supply for household energy storage inverters, so that the inverter uses a large-capacity power supply when it is loaded with medium or large loads, and uses a small-capacity power supply when it is loaded with light loads or no load, and avoids large losses caused by the two-stage inverter when using a large-capacity power supply with a small load with the purpose of energy saving. The solution adopts a peak detection circuit on the AC power supply side, which can accurately detect the tiny current when the 1∼3W-load is connected, so as to accurately judge the access and exit of the load, so that the power supply can enter or exit the power saving mode of the small-capacity power supply in a timely and flexible manner. In this paper, the feasibility and rationality of the scheme are tested by simulation, and it is proved that the power saving effect of the scheme is remarkable.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,10.1117/12.2621978

Dental Ceramics: From Science and Technology to Clinical Application,"© 2022. Quintessence Publishing Company, LtdDental ceramics have been around in various forms for over two centu ries. Up to the 1960s they were limited to use for denture teeth, inlays and onlays, and porcelain jacket crowns for anterior teeth. Ceramics bring esthetics, but are traditionally limited by their brittleness, as they are susceptible to short-term (fracture) and long-term (fatigue) failures. The role of modern ceramics in dentistry began to become more prominent with the development of resilient metal copings or strong ceramic cores to support weak porcelain veneers.1 Subsequently, new high-strength ceramics, specifically aluminas, zirconias, and lithia-based glass-ceramics, have expanded their usage to more demanding dental prostheses, such as crowns and fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). The challenge has always been to improve high structural durability while maintaining esthetic qualities. Over the last few decades, dental companies and researchers have strived to meet this challenge. With a burgeoning number of new ceramics enter ing the market, today’s clinician has a wide range of material choices for restorative procedures",International Journal of Prosthodontics,10.1117/12.2621968
THE USE OF GRANULAR FOAM-GLASS CERAMIC IN THE ARCTIC CONSTRUCTION OF LOW-RISE BUILDINGS,"© Melnikov V. P., Melnikova A. A., Ivanov K. S., 2022.Construction on permafrost in the harsh climatic conditions of the Arctic requires the use of both innovative materials and special engineering solutions. It is well known that the heat released during the operation of buildings can cause thawing of a frozen base, which leads to a loss of stability, irreversible deformations and the occurrence of accidents. One of the problem solutions is to maintain the base of the structure in a frozen state throughout the entire period of operation by using heat-insulating materials. The Arctic zone of Russia has inexhaustible local raw materials: opal-cristobalite and zeolite rocks for obtaining environmentally friendly heat-insulating material and providing the regional construction industry. Thus the authors propose a new technology of low-rise construction on permafrost foundations with the use of granulated foam-glass ceramic. They aim the study at the establishing the effect of a heat-insulating layer of granules on the temperature regime of permafrost foundation of low-rise building. The use of the mathematical modeling method enables the authors to analyze the thermal interaction of a heated building with permafrost foundation and assess the effectiveness of the proposed technology. The main properties of granulated foam-glass ceramic are: granule size 10–20 mm, bulk density 250 kg/m3, com-pressive strength in a cylinder 1,8 MPa, effective thermal conductivity of the granule layer in the compacted state 0,08 W/(m·°C). Based on the calculated data, the authors select design solutions that allow the operation of low-rise buildings while maintaining the bases in a frozen state, as a result of which, the stability and bearing capacity increase. The research results contribute to the trouble-free operation of buildings in the permafrost zone and the rational development of the Arctic zone of Russia. Taking into account the remoteness of the Arctic from the industrially developed regions, a significant economic effect in low-rise construction can be achieved through the creation of a production of granular foam-glass ceramic near construction sites.",Arktika: Ekologia i Ekonomika,10.1117/12.2622130
Tellurite-germanate ZnTe: glass-ceramics doped with EuF3 for optical fiber application,"© 2022 SPIE.Eu3+ - doped oxyfluoride tellurite-germanate glass-ceramics were fabricated by the controlled crystallization method. The microstructure and structure of samples were analysed using x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and infrared spectroscopy (IR). The EuF3 introduction caused the rise of the non-bridging oxygens/fluorides in glass network in a consequence of the [TeO,F4] and [GeO,F4] structural units transformation into the [TeO,F3]/[TeO,F3+1], and [GeO,F6], respectively. These changes were caused by Eu3+ ions, which played the role as a network modifier and led to the new non-bridging oxygens/fluorides Te-O,F−...Eu3+...O,F−-Te, and Ge-O,F−...Eu3+...O,F−-Ge, linkages formation and the ZnTe crystalline phase. The structure changes caused by the Eu3+ ions incorporation in the crystalline phase have been discussed in accordance to analysed the photoluminescence (PL) spectra and decay curves. It was showed a significant increase of the 5D0 → 7F1 magnetic-dipole transition intensity and decay times for transparent glass-ceramics sample. It confirmed the migration of Eu3+ ions from the amorphous network into ZnTe nanocrystals.",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1117/12.2620488
Colour tuneable upconversion photonic materials for anti-counterfeiting security inks,"© 2022 SPIE.Ultimate generation of luminescent security inks have been used to detect counterfeiting including applications in banknotes, quick response codes (QR codes), barcodes, security documents, drug packaging and food security. Anti-counterfeiting strategies are competitively developed against fast-growing counterfeit markets. So far, most security inks are based on the down-conversion effect, that is transforming UV incident radiation into visible light. But the substrates are sensitive to this UV “reading light”, which leads to a reduction of the contrast between the substrate and the printed sample. Therefore, rare-earth doped upconversion luminescent materials present significant advantages compared to standard fluorescent dyes, such as invisibility in ambient light, excitation by low cost commercial NIR irradiation and a lack in background noise, due to negligible auto-fluorescence from the surface. However, more attention needs to be paid on the codification of overall emitted luminescence, so it will be more difficult to mimic by ever increasing sophisticated counterfeiters. Thus, we present upconversion emissions in rare-earth doped nano-glass-ceramics (nGCs) under NIR excitation at 980 nm. Intensity ratios among UV and VIS upconversion emission bands can be tailored by modifying doping concentration level. Specific doping level, excitation wavelength and focusing conditions give rise to additional security features based on light-responsive encryption security patterns. A multi-digit code based on these intensity ratios can be set from resulting spectra, providing a proof-of-concept test for light-responsive encryption security patterns.",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1080/15397734.2022.2068577
Enhancing Photocatalysis by means of up-conversion photonics materials for pollutant degradation and hydrogen generation: “Bridge the gap”,"© 2022 SPIE.Enhancing the efficiency of solar energy harvesting schemes, particularly photocatalytic processes, by means of spectral converting materials stands up as an emerging route not yet fully explored. In this context, there is a growing interest in harvesting energy from the large near-infrared (NIR) range of solar radiation (approx. 60% in terms of the photon number or 40% of the energy from the sun's total incoming radiation) for various energy and environmental applications. The immediate goal is to bridge the gaps of photocatalysts by shifting NIR photons into UV-VIS ones through up-conversion photonic mechanisms. Here we present different photonic materials (glasses, crystals and solvothermal core-shell nanocrystals) showing high intense NIR-to-UV-VIS upconversion luminescence. Photocatalytic degradation of organic dye methylene blue as a pollutant model has been successfully attained under NIR radiation. We have also successfully achieved hydrogen and oxygen evolution via water-splitting using Al-doped SrTiO3 (STO:Al) photocatalyst, loaded with rhodium-chromium oxide (RhCrOx) as a hydrogen evolution cocatalyst in order to enable the overall water-splitting reaction. Both experiments have been carried out under low-power commercial 980 nm laser irradiation. Up-conversion driven photocatalysis is proved, as a solely photonic effect, converting incident NIR radiation before reaching the contaminated solution. We also explore the implementation of rare-earth doped upconversion materials with the performance of luminescent solar concentrators (LSC), as a promising option for enhancing the efficiency of optical devices.",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1088/1742-6596/2285/1/012009
"Transparent glass-ceramics based on Ti3+-doped ZnAl2O4 nanocrystals: synthesis, structure and optical properties","© 2022 SPIE.Trivalent titanium ions (Ti3+) are known for their broadband emission in the visible and near-IR. Zinc aluminate spinel, or gahnite (ZnAl2O4) is known as a host matrix for transition-metal ions. We report on the structure and spectroscopic properties of transparent zinc aluminosilicate glass-ceramics (GCs) nucleated by TiO2 and based on Ti3+-doped ZnAl2O4 nanocrystals. The initial glasses were melted under different redox conditions. After heat-treatments at the temperatures in the range of 720 to 1100 °C, transparent GCs were obtained. The materials were studied by the DSC method, XRD analysis, Raman, absorption and luminescence spectroscopy. The main crystalline phase in GCs is ZnAl2O4 with a cubic structure. The crystals are 5 - 21 nm in size. Their unit cell parameters vary with the heat-treatment temperature due to the titanium ions entering the gahnite nanocrystals. The volume fraction of gahnite nanophase increases with the heat-treatment temperature. At 1000 - 1100 °C, TiO2 (rutile) crystals with a size of 11 - 37 nm also appear. In GCs obtained from glasses melted under reducing conditions, broadband absorption is observed in the visible and near IR due to the Ti3+ ions in Oh positions in ZnAl2O4 crystals, the absorption of Ti3+ - Ti4+ pairs and the appearance of Ti3+ self-doped rutile. By changing the redox conditions of the glass synthesis, one can control the content of titanium ions in various oxidation states and the spectral properties of GCs.",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1016/j.matpr.2021.08.261
Alkali-germanate glass-ceramics doped with manganese and chromium ions,"© 2022 SPIE.This work is devoted to investigation of the spectral and luminescent properties of lithium-germanate, lithium-sodium-germanate and lithium-zinc-germanate glass ceramics obtained by high-temperature heat treatment of the initial glass doped with manganese and chromium ions. It is shown that when sodium is added to Mn-doped lithium germanate glass-ceramics, the luminescence intensity of Mn4+ ions increases from 5 to 37% of the quantum yield. In lithium-zinc-germanate glass-ceramics, the simultaneous presence of Mn4+ ions in an octahedral environment with red luminescence near 670 nm and Mn2+ ions in a tetragonal environment with long persistent green luminescence at 540 nm is found. The maximum quantum yield for red luminescence was 47%, for green luminescence - 23%. The intensity ratio of different luminescence bands depends on the ratio of lithium/zinc ions in the glass composition. In all studied glass-ceramics, Cr3+ ions demonstrate weak luminescence with a maximum in the region of 690-698 nm. The possibility of using the materials under study as a luminescent red radiation source material is considered.",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1016/j.matpr.2021.09.398

Spectral properties of cesium lead iodide perovskite nanocrystals in borogermanate glass at different temperatures,"© 2022 SPIE.The aim of this work is to investigate temperature effect on spectral properties CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals nucleated in borogermanate glass by isothermal heat treatment at different temperatures. The temperature dependence of the first exciton absorption intensity in the heating-cooling cycle has a form of hysteresis loop, which helps determine crystallization and melting temperatures. Considering anomalies on heat curves, a phase transition from a non-perovskite to a cubic crystal structure is found in the range of 420-460℃. The increase of initial nucleation temperature from 470 to 550℃ results in a change of phase transitions temperatures: melting, crystallization, and transition from a non-perovskite to a cubic crystal structure increase in the regions 454-475, 281-301 and 421-459℃ respectively due to quantum-sized effect. Results demonstrate that the cesium lead halide perovskite properties can be stabilized up to 440℃, which greatly exceeds the chemical resistance of perovskites in organic matrix.",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1117/12.2620624

Spectroscopic properties of fluoroindate glass and glass-ceramics doped with Eu3+ ions,"© 2022 SPIE.Fluoroindate glass is characterized by low phonon energy (500 cm-1), which enables most of the radiative transitions in the lanthanides to occur in the range VIS-NIR. It allows considering this matrix as a potential host glass for NIR emission and light sources. This work reports the fabrication and analysis of luminescence properties, and structure of the fluoroindate glasses and glass-ceramics (GC) co-doped with Eu3+ ions. The materials' microstructure and structure were analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman measurement techniques, respectively. It has been shown that the basic structural units in the glass network are [InF6] octahedrons tetrahedrons. The luminescence analysis was performed in the glass and glass-ceramics samples doped with EuF3 showing the excitation and emission properties and changes in the lifetimes. The excitation at 395 nm resulted in different emissions in blue, green, and red which correspond to the transitions from 5DJ (J=0 to 3) multiples to the 7FJ (J= 0 to 6), which is the effect of the low phonon energy of the matrix and is comparable with other low phonon materials. In the glass-ceramics, the effect of network ordering around the Eu3+ ions was noticed. The fluorescence intensity ratio R/O related to 5D0→7F2 and 5D0→7F1 transitions in Eu3+ decreased from 0.74 to 0.56 value. Obtained results allowed to consider this GC material as a potential host for luminescent material and possibly glass fiber sources.",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1155/2022/9662805
Photoluminescence of Er/Yb-doped zinc-silicate glass and glass ceramics with ZnO and Zn2SiO4 nanoparticles,"© 2022 SPIE.Zinc-silicate glass-ceramic materials based on ZnO and Zn2SiO4 nanoparticles distributed in amorphous silica matrix represent one of the most perspective options to improve the photoluminescence properties of Er3+ ions, thanks to their low phonon energy and the possibility of energy transfer between the ZnO/Zn2SiO4 nanoparticles and Er3+ ions. In this paper, we focus on the investigation of crystallization in the sodium- and potassium-zinc-silicate system and the photoluminescence properties of Er3+-doped glass-ceramic materials. It was found that the presence of Na2O promotes the crystallization of Zn2SiO4 resulting in non-transparent glass-ceramic material at 750 °C, whereas the K2O-ZnO-SiO2 material remained transparent in the entire heat treatment range. Nevertheless, the crystallization of ZnO and Zn2SiO4 leads to an increase of photoluminescence intensity of Er3+ ions by up to 300 % compared to the pre-cursor glass. The Stark-splitting of the Er3+ emission spectra at 1.5 μm after 978 nm excitation as well as shortening of the fluorescence lifetime suggest the incorporation of Er3+ ions inside the highly symmetric environment of ZnO and Zn2SiO4",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1155/2022/8605099
A comparative study on hybrid fatigue stress-life model of RC beams strengthened with NSM CFRP,"© 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Near Surface Mounted Carbon Fiber-reinforced Polymers (NSM FRP) are becoming widely used in the rehabilitation field of concrete structures. Several studies were conducted to evaluate the fatigue performance of Reinforced Concrete (RC) bridges strengthened with NSM FRP composite materials. Most stress-life (S-N) fatigue models of RC beams are based on fatigue testing that has been conducted in the region of load cycles ranging between 103 and 107. This might cause an inaccuracy in the stress-life predictions when the common S-N formulations are used. This paper presents a review of the recent research on the fatigue behavior of RC beams and proposes a hybrid fatigue stress-life model of RC beams strengthened with NSM CFRP. An analytical fatigue S-N model was developed based on experimental fatigue data of constant amplitude of tension-tension cyclic loading obtained from the literature. A hybrid formulation was used, combining both exponential and power regression analyses to enhance the accuracy of prediction in low and high cycle fatigue regions. Moreover, Muratov’s method was used to determine the endurance limit of strengthened RC beams. A three-dimensional finite element RC beam strengthened with NSM CFRP was modeled to investigate the accuracy of the proposed hybrid model. The RC beam was modeled in ANSYS with similar dimensions and material properties to experimental specimens in the literature. The hybrid model was compared to experimental and numerical data, and satisfactory precision was observed with a correlation coefficient of 0.86. The proposed hybrid model helps to provide comprehensive fatigue stress-life estimation for design purposes.",Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines,10.4012/dmj.2021-224

The influence of different CAD/CAM materials on the marginal fit of endocrown with different cavity depths (A comparative in-vitro study),"© 2022To evaluate and compare the influence of dissimilar CAD-CAM material on the marginal fitness of endocrown with different cavity depths. Freshly extracted human maxillary first premolar teeth (n = 40) were selected for this study. Teeth were decapitated 2 mm above the cement-enamel junction from proximal surface and endodontic treatment were performed for all teeth. Samples were allocated at two main groups (n = 20), according to cavity depth. Group A: 2 mm cavity depth; Group B: 4 mm cavity depth; and further subdivided into two sub-groups according to material used (n = 10): (A1 and B1) resin-based material; (A2 and B2) ceramic-based material. Teeth were prepared with butt joint margin and 10° internal axial wall divergence. Afterwards, samples scanning was performed using InLab digital scanner. Endocrown restoration fabricated by Sirona Cerec InLab MCXL milling device and adhesively luted with a resin cement (RelyX™ Ultimate ClickerTM, 3 M ESPE). All samples were subjected to thermocycling. After thermocycling, marginal gaps were measured using stereomicroscope at a magnification of 45X. The recorded measurements were collected, scaled and statistically analyzed. A resin-based endocrown showed significantly a smaller vertical marginal gap than ceramic-based, an endocrown with 2-mm cavity depth showed significantly lower marginal gap than one with 4-mm cavity depth. Increasing the cavity depth of endocrown preparation negatively affect the marginal fit. Resin-nanoceramic endocrown showed better marginal fit than glass ceramic endocrown.

Fracture resistance of CAD/CAM restorative materials in mismatched removable partial denture rests: An in vitro experimental and finite element analysis,"© 2022, Japanese Society for Dental Materials and Devices. All rights reserved.To evaluate the fracture resistance of computer-aided design and computer-assisted manufacturing restorations as the abutment of removable partial dentures, experimental blocks, with the rest seat made of feldspar, hybrid resin composite, lithium disilicate glass ceramic, or zirconia, were subjected to loading by a metallic occlusal rest. The rest contacted the rest seat with an accurate fit and two mismatch contact conditions: bottom and sidewall contact. Zirconia exhibited the highest fracture load, and the fracture load of the accurate fit was significantly higher than that of the sidewall contact (p<0.05) and insignificantly higher than that of the bottom contact (p>0.05).

In Vitro Performance of Different Universal Adhesive Systems on Several CAD/CAM Restorative Materials After Thermal Aging,"©Operative Dentistry, 2022.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the microshear bond strength (mSBS) of 10 universal adhesive systems applied on five different CAD/CAM restorative materials, immediately and after thermal aging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five CAD/CAM materials were selected: 1) feldspathic glass ceramic (FeCe); 2) pre-polymerized reinforced resin composite (ReRC); 3) leucite-reinforced glass ceramic (LeGC); 4) lithium disilicate (LiDi); and 5) yttrium-stabilized zirconium dioxide (ZiDi). For each material, 15 blocks were cut into four rectangular sections (6 × 6 × 6 mm; n=60 per group) and processed as recommended by the respective manufacturer. For each indirect material, the following adhesive systems were applied according to the respective manufacturer's instructions: 1) AdheSE Universal [ADU]; 2) All-Bond Universal [ABU]; 3) Ambar Universal [AMB]; 4) Clearfil Universal Bond [CFU]; 5) Futurabond U [FBU]; 6) One Coat 7 Universal [OCU]; 7) Peak Universal Bond [PUB]; 8) Prime&Bond Elect [PBE]; 9) Scotchbond Universal Adhesive [SBU]; 10) Xeno Select [XEN, negative control]. After the application of the adhesive system, cylinder-shaped transparent matrices were filled with a dual-curing resin cement (NX3) and light cured. Specimens were tested in shear mode at 1.0 mm/min (mSBS), after 24 hours and 10,000 thermal cycles (TC). All data were submitted to statistical analysis (α=0.05). RESULTS: For FeCe, there was no significant decrease in mean mSBS for AMB, FBU, and SBU after TC when compared at 24 hours. For ReRC, AMB and SBU showed higher mean mSBS when compared to CFU and XEN, after 24 hours and TC. For LiDi, FBU and OCU showed higher mean mSBS when compared to CFU and XEN, after 24 hours and TC. For LeGC, AMB and PUB showed higher mean mSBS when compared to XEN, after 24 hours and TC. For ZiDi, OCU and SBU showed higher mean mSBS when compared to XEN, after 24 hours and TC. In addition, PBE and XEN showed the lowest mean mSBS after TC with higher percentage of bond strength reduction. CONCLUSIONS: The mean mSBS among the different universal adhesives varied widely for each CAD/CAM material used. In addition, most universal adhesives underwent a statistically significant bond strength reduction after TC.",Operative dentistry,10.1177/14644207221100043
Structure and luminescent properties of Sm/Dy-doped Sr2MgSi2O7 glass–ceramics,"© 2022 The Authors. International Journal of Applied Glass Science published by American Ceramics Society and Wiley Periodicals LLC.Sm3+-doped and Sm3+/Dy3+ codoped SiO2–SrO–MgO glasses were prepared by conventional melt quenching and Sr2MgSi2O7 based glass–ceramics from sintering and crystallization of the glass powders. The thermal, structural, and optical properties of the glasses and glass–ceramics were investigated as a function of the dopant concentration. The optical characterization includes the photoluminescence spectra and the lifetimes of the 4G5/2 (Sm3+) and 4F9/2 (Dy3+) excited states. In Sm3+ single-doped samples, the emission intensity increases up to a concentration of 0.3 mol% Sm3+ ions and then decreases due to nonradiative energy transfer processes. The emission spectra in the glass–ceramics show a more resolved structure and higher intensity compared to the glass samples, suggesting a different and crystalline environment for the Sm3+ ions. The non-radiative processes also influence the experimental decays of the glass samples which deviate from a single exponential with lifetimes decreasing as Sm3+ concentration increases. The emission and excitation spectra of the codoped samples do not show significant energy transfer between Sm3+ and Dy3+ ions. Different emitting colors can be obtained in the codoped glasses by changing the excitation wavelength. The studied glass–ceramics could be applied as enamels on ceramic or metallic substrates.",International Journal of Applied Glass Science,10.1016/j.matpr.2022.04.818
Constructing an electrical microenvironment based on electroactive polymers in the field of bone tissue engineering,"© 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.The process of bone tissue repair and regeneration must occur in a suitable electrical microenvironment, which is one of the most important microenvironments. Electroactive materials appropriately simulate the bioelectric nature of bone and provide the electrical microenvironment required for bone repair, which accelerates bone repair and regeneration. The concept of electrical stimulation-induced osteogenesis promotes the development of electroactive materials as orthopedic implants. This article reviews the general bioelectric phenomena in organisms and the electrical response of natural bone, and briefly explains the promotion of bone regeneration by the electrical microenvironment. Electroactive materials in the field of bone tissue engineering are divided into two categories, such as piezoelectric polymers and conductive polymers, and the material properties, research progress, and applications of each will be described in detail. This article analyzes the limitations of piezoelectric and conductive materials for constructing an electrical microenvironment, reveals the potential of these two materials for overcoming the application limitations of a single type of electroactive material, and discusses the principles. The future challenges and developmental prospects of electroactive materials are discussed. This review comprehensively emphasizes the important characteristics of electroactive biomaterials and points out the direction of development for composite applications of different electroactive materials.",International Journal of Polymeric Materials and Polymeric Biomaterials,10.4028/p-44ir6o
Comparison of Al2O3-reinforced sintered and extruded AA2014 nano-hybrid composite particle size effects on mechanical and metallurgical characteristics,"© The Electrochemical SocietyResearchers are interested in developing new nano-composite materials because of aluminium metal matrix composites (AMCs) have unique properties. An important goal of this research is to compare the effects on the AA2014 hybrid nano-composite of varying weight percentages of Al2O3 particles (micro-size 30-60 nm and nano-size (60-90 nm)). In order to fully characterize the composites, mechanical and metallurgical tests are performed on them. Alumina-reinforced particles weight percentages (1-10 %) are varied to perform a comparative analysis. Mechanical characteristics such as Yield Strength-280 MPa and Ultimate Tensile Strength-290 MPa are significantly improved in the AA2014 hybrid composite third sample-compared to the other samples. In the sintered samples, the interfacial bonding between AA2014 and Al2O3 was found to be as small as possible (90 Vickers Hardness Number). Extruded composite in third sample (330 MPa) has 1.157 times the compressive strength of a sintered sample. The analysis of the AA2014 hybrid composite identifies agglomeration and segregation of alumina-reinforced nanoparticles.",ECS Transactions,10.1039/d2tc00906d
"Synthesis, microstructure and ferroelectric properties of PbO-TiO2-B2O3 based glass ceramics","© 2022The following compositions were utilised to make these glasses: PbO (50-X) TiO2 (25 + X) and B2O3 (X = 0, 5, 10, and 12.5 mol percent) are the main components of this mixture. A two-stage heat treatment process was used to make glass-ceramics. In the glass ceramics, tetragonal lead titanate and lead borate were found to be the main crystalline phases, according to XRD data (PbB2O4).

On the influence of the elastic characteristics of composite materials on the vibrating properties,"© The Author(s) 2022.Economical composite materials such as PA66GF35 (glass-fibre-reinforced polyamide matrix) are being increasingly used in the automotive industry. Their good mechanical characteristics combined with low density, very high workability, low production cost and high availability are attractive prerogatives that induce engineers to adopt it in complex technological challenges. Injection moulding is the most common production technology used to realize composite components. While in industrial design this type of material is considered as isotropic, it is well known that injection moulding process gives orientation to the reinforcing fibres, leading to anisotropic mechanical behaviour. Starting from these considerations, attention has been turned to the vibrating properties of such materials and to the comparison between vibration modes and mechanical properties. In fact, composite materials are also used to produce components in the automotive field significantly affected by noise problems. Since the noise derives from a fluid-structure interaction, the own frequencies and the vibrating modes cover an important role on the Noise, Vibration and Harshness performance of the components. A comparison of the vibration modes of a plate in PA66GF35, numerically modeled both as isotropic and anisotropic material according to Folgar and Tucker theory, was carried out and compared with experimental measurements. The anisotropy of the composite material is demonstrated by the variation of the mechanical characteristics obtained from the static tensile tests. Results show that injection moulding confers different mechanical properties to real components due to the intrinsic fluid-dynamic phenomena of the production process.",JVC/Journal of Vibration and Control,10.1039/d1ta11066g
Experimental investigation on the strength and durability aspect of bacterial self-healing concrete with GGBS and dolomite powder,"© 2022Because of its strength and long-term durability, concrete is one of the most important construction materials. Because of the brittleness that happens when concrete structures are strained, their ductility and cracking decrease. On a daily basis, a range of enhancements are being produced based on continuing research throughout the world to solve the inadequacies of cement-concrete construction. Current concrete technology research is aimed at overcoming the challenges of developing special concrete structures while considering the faster construction, high strength, and durability of concrete made from industrial waste materials such as fly ash, ground-granulated blasting slag (GGBS), silica fume, metakaolin, and dolomite powder, among others. In recent years, the application of these biomineralization principles to concrete has resulted in the creation of a unique material known as “bacterial concrete.” Using bacteria as a model, this experiment was carried out and the findings were presented. In a model laboratory, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus sphaericus, and Bacillus pasteurising, among other bacteria, are cultured for this technique. When microorganisms are used, calcium carbonate precipitates in concrete. This precipitation will occur naturally as a consequence of biological activity and will be pollution-free. In a number of studies, cement has been partially replaced with GGBS and dolomite powder, ranging from 0% to 50% replacement; specimens have been cast with bacteria and specimens have been cast without bacteria in various trials. When comparing specimens that contain and do not contain microorganisms, the compressive strength of the samples is evaluated. According to the findings, adding bacteria to concrete enhances the mix's compressive strength. Bacterial concrete has been shown to have long-term durability (RCPT, Mercury Porosity, Acidity). As seen above, this bacterial concrete calcite manufacturing technology is not only ecologically benign but also cost-effective.",Materials Today: Proceedings,10.1007/978-981-16-8341-1_6
Physical properties of cullet-clay glass ceramic containing titanium nitride,"© 2022Recycle glass as a major component in ceramic fabrication has received tremendous attention due to multi advantages as a starting material. A series of glass ceramics based on recycled glass cullet-kaolin clay containing titanium nitride has successfully been made. The X-ray diffraction technique has been used to characterized the ceramic. Meanwhile, the physical properties such as density have been determined using the Archimedes Principle and their mechanical characteristic such as Vickers hardness and Young's Modulus has been determined in a usual manner. It is found that the ceramic is characterized by the occurrence of major crystalline peaks of Quartz and Tridymite while alumina and titania coexist as the minor phases. The density is observed to vary depending upon the cullet content while the hardness and elasticity are very much dependent on the concentration of titanium nitride. The SEM image indicates that for higher TiN content, the pores on the microstructural surface seem to be dispersed thus producing a smoother surface.",Materials Today: Proceedings,10.1590/1678-7757-2021-0475
Systematic evidence on migrating and extractable food contact chemicals: Most chemicals detected in food contact materials are not listed for use,"© 2022 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Food packaging is important for today’s globalized food system, but food contact materials (FCMs) can also be a source of hazardous chemicals migrating into foodstuffs. Assessing the impacts of FCMs on human health requires a comprehensive identification of the chemicals they contain, the food contact chemicals (FCCs). We systematically compiled the “database on migrating and extractable food contact chemicals” (FCCmigex) using information from 1210 studies. We found that to date 2881 FCCs have been detected, in a total of six FCM groups (Plastics, Paper & Board, Metal, Multi-materials, Glass & Ceramic, and Other FCMs). 65% of these detected FCCs were previously not known to be used in FCMs. Conversely, of the more than 12’000 FCCs known to be used, only 1013 are included in the FCCmigex database. Plastic is the most studied FCM with 1975 FCCs detected. Our findings expand the universe of known FCCs to 14,153 chemicals. This knowledge contributes to developing non-hazardous FCMs that lead to safer food and support a circular economy.",Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition,10.2186/jpr.JPR_D_20_00276
Erosion wear characteristics of step-wise layered polymer composite materials by silica sand particles,"© IMechE 2022.Polymer composite materials (PCMs) can sustain themselves in harsh environments without suffering any loss of properties of the constituents. The present study focussed on erosion wear behavior of step-wise layered polymer composite materials (LPCMs). Samples were fabricated with epoxy as matrix and aluminum as filler particles using hand lay-up technique. Volume fraction of the filler was varied at four different layers along the direction thickness. Experiments were conducted at room temperature using angular shaped silica sand erodent impacting at 151 m/s and at impingement angles of 30°, 45°, 60° and 90°. Due to the variation in filler content, testing of samples was performed at two different orientations: i) top to bottom (T-B) and ii) bottom to top (B-T). The increased filler content reduced the erosion wear as tested from B-T, while a reverse trend was observed along T-B. Moreover, erosion wear was found to be higher at 45° impingement angle indicating the semi-ductile nature of LPCMs. At this angle, the erosion wear rate at top layer was 76.47% lower compared to bottom due to the presence of high filler content.","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications",10.1007/s12633-022-01907-0
Enhancing the material properties of carbon fiber epoxy composite by incorporating electrospun polyacrylonitrile nanofibers,"© 2022Composite materials are a superior class of material used in almost every field of engineering like construction, military, aerospace, ocean structures, communication, and various other high-performance applications owing to their high specific strength and modulus, increased design flexibility, desirable thermal expansion characteristics good resistance to fatigue and corrosion, and economic efficiency. However, their ply-by-ply nature makes them susceptible to delamination, which originates from the propagation of microcracks in the weak resin-rich layers. Many attempts have been made to address the lack of mechanical properties of this weak interlaminar region. A particularly promising approach involves the incorporation of nanofibers between the reinforcement layers as the composite is laid up. This work involves studying the property improvements in carbon fiber epoxy composite by interleaving electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers. Experimental testing involving Tensile, Izod, Charpy and high velocity impact tests showed improved material properties for the PAN nano-interleaved composite. These improvements achieved by nanofiber interleaving shows a greater potential in addressing major concerns for critical application of composite materials in future.",Materials Today: Proceedings,10.1109/ICIPTM54933.2022.9754054

Ultra-stable narrowband green-emitting CsPbBr3 quantum dot-embedded glass ceramics for wide color gamut backlit displays,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryPerovskite quantum dots are considered to be one of the most promising materials for next-generation backlight displays due to their narrow emission width, high color purity and tunable luminescence. However, the deterioration and failure of perovskite quantum dots under stimulation from the external environment (e.g., light, heat, and humid air) limit their practical applications. Herein, CsPbBr3@glass with excellent stability and optical properties was successfully prepared by optimizing the quantum dot nucleation/growth conditions. The CsPbBr3@glass@PDMS hierarchical structure film with a full width at half maximum of ∼17 nm and photoluminescence quantum yield of ∼80% was obtained via the physical dilution method to eliminate the internal filtering effect. Benefiting from the dual protection of the inorganic glass network and PDMS polymer matrix, the film exhibited excellent water/heat resistance. As an application demonstration, a white LED backlit unit was designed by coupling a CsPbBr3@glass@PDMS green film and Mn4+:K2SiF6 red film with a home-made blue light guide panel, endowing the LCD with a wide color gamut (a color gamut of 159% for commercial LCD, 108% for NTSC, and 81% for Rec. 2020), confirming its great potential in the display industry.",Journal of Materials Chemistry C,10.1021/bk-2022-1411.ch011

This work is licensed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Acrylic resin is the dominant material that is broadly utilised to produce partial and complete dentures. The exposure of the denture-base acrylic resins to the oral environment as well as storing media for a certain period causes saliva sorption. In this study, composite materials-based polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) reinforced with 1 wt% of glass fibres and (3, 6 and 9 wt%) yttrium oxide (Y2O3 ) have been prepared, and the addition influence upon some mechanical tests (tensile, flexural, hardness and surface roughness) has been investigated. Afterward, the mechanical properties of composite materials after immersion in artificial saliva for seven days have been evaluated. The results show that the Y2O3 percentage is 6%, which possesses a perfect feature. Thus, such a sample may be an encouraging material for achieving the needed properties for denture use. Furthermore, all mechanical properties were decreased after immersion in synthetic saliva.",Journal of Physical Science,10.1021/bk-2022-1411.ch001
Interface engineering on a Li metal anode for an electro-chemo-mechanically stable anodic interface in all-solid-state batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryDespite the extensive interest in Li metal-based all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) with sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs), the physically, chemically, and electrochemically unstable anodic interface has impeded the achievement of performance retention at the commercial level for this system. Herein, we report Li metal anodes protected from interfacial instability by an intervening layer composed of a Li-In alloy and LiI in an Li2S-P2S5 glass ceramic matrix synthesized by a solution process. At a unique precursor composition of Li2S:P2S5:InI3, complexation of the precursor for complete dissolution in the solvent is achieved, producing a homogeneous precursor solution for coating. The elaborate solution synthesis enables the formation of a dense and void-free thin protective interlayer for the complete separation of Li metal and SE. The chemical affinity between the Li2S-P2S5 glass ceramic matrix and Li3PS4 SE adds physical stability to the anodic interface. The combined physical stability, the chemical inertness of Li-In and LiI against Li metal, and fast Li migration through the Li-In alloy, LiI, and Li2S-P2S5 glass ceramic matrix give the anodic interface electro-chemo-mechanical stability. The full ASSB paired with the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode exhibits notably superior stability, particularly at a high current, proving the suppression of dendritic growth of Li by the protective layer.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.13168/cs.2022.0010

Residual stress estimated by nanoindentation in pontics and abutments of veneered zirconia fixed dental prostheses,"© 2022, Faculdade De Odontologia De Bauru. All rights reserved.Glass ceramics’ fractures in zirconia fixed dental prosthesis (FDP) remains a clinical challenge since it has higher fracture rates than the gold standard, metal ceramic FDP. Nanoindentation has been shown a reliable tool to determine residual stress of ceramic systems, which can ultimately correlate to failure-proneness. Objectives: To assess residual tensile stress using nanoindentation in veneered three-unit zirconia FDPs at different surfaces of pontics and abutments. Methodology: Three composite resin replicas of the maxillary first premolar and crown-prepared abutment first molar were made to obtain three-unit FDPs. The FDPs were veneered with glass ceramic containing fluorapatite crystals and resin cemented on the replicas, embedded in epoxy resin, sectioned, and polished. Each specimen was subjected to nanoindentation in the following regions of interest: 1) Mesial premolar abutment (MPMa); 2) Distal premolar abutment (DPMa); 3) Buccal premolar abutment (BPMa); 4) Lingual premolar abutment (LPMa); 5) Mesial premolar pontic (MPMp); 6) Distal premolar pontic (DPMp); 7) Buccal premolar pontic (BPMp); 8) Lingual premolar pontic (LPMp); 9) Mesial molar abutment (MMa); 10) Distal molar abutment (DMa); 11) Buccal molar abutment (BMa); and 12) Lingual molar abutment (LMa). Data were assessed using Linear Mixed Model and Least Significant Difference (95%) tests. Results: Pontics had significantly higher hardness values than premolar (p=0.001) and molar (p=0.007) abutments, suggesting lower residual stress levels. Marginal ridges yielded higher hardness values for connectors (DPMa, MMa, MPMp and DPMp) than for outer proximal surfaces of abutments (MPMa and DMa). The mesial marginal ridge of the premolar abutment (MPMa) had the lowest hardness values, suggesting higher residual stress concentration. Conclusions: Residual stress in three-unit FDPs was lower in pontics than in abutments. The outer proximal surfaces of the abutments had the highest residual stress concentration.",Journal of Applied Oral Science,10.1021/bk-2022-1411.ch009
"Effect of tooth brush abrasion on the color, gloss and surface roughness of internally and externally stained monolithic ceramic materials","© 2021 Japan Prosthodontic Society.Purpose: To measure the durability of the color, change in surface roughness and gloss of stained monolithic ceramic materials subjected to artificial tooth brush abrasion. Materials and methods: Standardized specimens were manufactured from pressable lithium-disilicate glass ceramic (PC; IPS e.max Press), machinable lithium-disilicate glass ceramic (MC; IPS e.max CAD), and zirconia (ZR; Zenostar). Ceramic staining was applied before (internal; in) and after crystallization/sintering (external; ex). Of each ceramic material, specimens without staining were prepared (no staining; no). Porcelain-fused-to-metal specimens served as control (PFM). Each group consisted of 15 specimens. Tooth brushing was simulated with tooth brushing strokes of 21.6 k, 43.2 k, and 64.8 k. Color, gloss and roughness were measured at baseline and after cycle intervals. Kruskal-Wallis and paired Post-hoc Conover tests were applied to detect statistical differences between treatment groups. Differences before and after aging were calculated by Wilcoxon signed rank test (α=0.05). Results: In all groups, color difference (∆E) was statistically significant after aging: no-PC (P<.001, 95% CI[0.14,0.84]), no-MC (P=.003, 95% CI[0.23,1.12]), no-ZR (P=.003, 95% CI[0.33,0.62]), in-MC (P=.003, 95% CI[0.35,0.73]), in-ZR (P=.003, 95% CI[0.09,0.32]), ex-PC (P=.003, 95% CI[0.54,0.98]), ex-MC (P<.001, 95% CI[0.23,1.26]), ex-ZR (P=.003, 95% CI[0.27,0.55]), and PFM (P=.002, 95% CI[0.22,0.34]). Aging increased surface roughness and decreased the gloss within all subgroups showing statistical significance. Conclusion: Color, gloss and roughness of stained monolithic ceramic materials changed significantly by means of tooth brush abrasion in vitro. Color changes were below the threshold value for the detection by the human eye (∆E 1.8).",Journal of Prosthodontic Research,10.1016/j.matpr.2022.04.154

EFFECT OF CRYSTALLISATION TEMPERATURE ON LAS TRANSPARENT GLASS-CERAMICS CONTAINING A HIGH Al2O3 CONTENT,"© 2022 University of Chemistry and Technology, Faculty of Environmental Technology. All rights reserved.The influence of the crystallisation temperature on the structure and properties of Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 (LAS) glass-ceramics with a high aluminium content was investigated. Glass-ceramics with ultra-low CTE and high transmittance were successfully prepared by the melt-quenching method and a two-step heat treatment. The crystallisation behaviour of the glass was studied via DSC and XRD. Besides, FTIR, Raman and FE-SEM were used to explore the structure of the samples under different crystallisation temperatures. The results showed that a β-quartz solid solution with nano-size precipitated from the glass after the heat treatment and when the crystallisation temperature was 820 °C, the bending strength and microhardness reached 156 MPa and 1082.09 HV, respectively.",Ceramics - Silikaty,10.1080/10408436.2022.2066624

Structural and spectroscopic studies of V2O5 incorporated lithium-bismuth-boro-tellurite glass ceramics,"© 2022The effect of dopant concentration on the spectroscopic characteristics of multi-component glass ceramics with the composition 25Li2O-(15-x) Bi2O3-45B2O3-15TeO2-xV2O5(x = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10 mol %) fabricated using traditional melt-quenching process is shown in this study. The prepared glass ceramics were extensively characterised using XRD, FTIR, EPR, etc. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) study reveals that the glasses were semi-crystalline (ceramic) in nature. In addition, Rietveld refinement was used to investigate the crystalline component in the glass network that is responsible for a ceramic nature of the prepared samples. Structural results reveal that the Bi2O3 was found in the crystalline cubic structure of 2 and 5 mol% V2O5 doped glass systems. In other words, the incorporation of V2O5 into the host glass matrix alters the structure of the glass, resulting in semi-crystallization of glass samples. Surprisingly, crystalline structure of LBBTV samples decreases as the V2O5 concentration was increased, owing to the stabilizing of the glass structure at higher doping concentrations. Physical parameters for instance, molar volume is in accordance (decreases till 5 mol % and then increases) with the XRD data. As the vanadium content increases, the FTIR spectra indicate a drastic shift in borate units. EPR spectra of glass ceramics and glasses show resonance signals typical of VO2+ ions.",Materials Today: Proceedings,10.5114/JOS.2022.114349

Effect of Photobiomodulation on Osteoblast-like Cells Cultured on Lithium Disilicate Glass-Ceramic,"© 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Biomaterials are employed to aid bone regeneration in localized bone defects, especially when there is a great loss of tissues, compromising their ability to repair. A new generation of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic presents favorable characteristics for bone reconstruction, such as high strength and bioactivity. In turn, photobiomodulation therapy has been studied in order to stimulate bone metabolism since it acts as a modulating agent for tissue regeneration. In this study, we evaluated the effect of photobiomodulation therapy on the interaction between osteoblastic cells and lithium disilicate glass-ceramic. MG63 cells suspension was seeded on lithium disilicate and glass discs. After 24 h samples were irradiated with a LED device (= 660 nm) with 50 mW/cm2, 2 J/cm2 for 40 s. Cell viability was assessed 2, 7, and 12 days after irradiation using MTS assay. Samples previously stained with alizarin red S were observed at a confocal microscope to evaluate calcification of bone matrix. We first observed an increase in the number of cells adhered to lithium disilicate, compared to glass discs on day 2. LED irradiation promoted an increase in the number of cells on day 12 in both irradiated groups, being quantitatively higher on disilicate discs. Disilicate discs also showed a higher deposition of calcium on the extracellular matrix compared to glass. Red light anticipated mineral deposition for all irradiated groups, being earlier for disilicate samples. In conclusion, photobiomodulation therapy anticipated the positive effects of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic on bone matrix formation and mineralization.",IFMBE Proceedings,10.13168/cs.2022.0005
Development of New Vitrified Bond for Diamond Grinding of Polycrystalline Diamond Compacts,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.It is well-known that diamond, be it natural or industrially man-made is the hardest material. Therefore, machining diamond parts such as polycrystalline diamond compacts (PDC) is a serious challenge because there is second to none in terms of hardness. This work presents an investigation and the development of a new vitrified material based on Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 glass ceramics, which was subsequently used to manufacture a grinding wheel. The performance of the developed diamond grinding wheel is studied here in a cylindrical grinding process of PDCs. The factors that influence the properties of grinding wheel such as amount of vitrified bond and the types and the amount of stuffing and additives in grinding wheel matrix were also investigated. It was found that additives such as Al2O3 or SiC reduced the grinding wheel life. Importantly, it was noticed that the new vitrified bond firmly held the diamond grains providing an extended wheel life of about 2.5–3 times of that of resin bond. The precision of the PDCs ground parts was improved from 0.03 μm to 0.01 μm. The grinding time was reduced by a factor of two, and the process was quieter than grinding with resin bonded wheels.",Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.01.027
Preparation and property analysis of solid carbonate-oxide composite materials for an electrolyte used in low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,"© 2021 IEEE.The oxide-carbonate composite electrolyte material with high ionic conductivity at low temperature has been thought that it can be used to develop LT-SOFC. However, the carbonate composite electrolyte is not easy to make it dense, especially mixing and packing oxide and carbonate to fabricate the composite electrolyte simply. In this article, rare-earth-doped CeO2 (RDC) (R = La, Sm, Gd, and Gd + Y) series samples were prepared by wet ball-milling, then sintered into fully dense and porous oxide bulk at 1500a 1600 C and 1000 C. Melted carbonate LNCO, composed of Li2CO3 and Na2CO3 at a molar ratio of 1:1, was combined with porous oxide bulk materials using a bath method at 500 C for 10 h to prepare a dense carbonate-oxide composite electrolyte. The dense oxide-carbonate composite electrolyte always obtains by this fabrication process. Boiling water was used to remove carbonate from these composites. Lattice parameters were obtained through Rietveld refinement, and a calculation procedure for quantifying the composite density was proposed. The quantified composite density results were verified through scanning electron microscopy microstructure observations. The Ce valence in the RDC oxides and RDC-carbonate composite was analyzed by X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy to observe the effects of heat treatment temperature and carbonate on the Ce4+/Ce3+ mixed-valence state in doped CeO2.",Science and Technology for Energy Transition (STET),10.1109/ASET53988.2022.9734818
Numerical Analysis of Tool Material in Ultrasonic Machining Process,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.The hard and fragile materials like glass, ceramic, titanium-aluminium composites can be machined by ultrasonic machining process. This process is influenced by various parameters such as types of abrasives, types of tool and workpiece materials, different types of horn and tool geometries, frequency, amplitude. The tool is one of the foremost components used in the USM process. The present study is considered the design of a stepped tool using dissimilar materials (tungsten carbide, stainless steel, and titanium) in dynamic conditions. A commercial software, COMSOL Multiphysics, is utilized to analyse the influence of materials on the tool performance. In the modal analysis, there are six different axial and non-axial modes generated for all the tool materials. The preferred mode at which axial mode of vibration is generated at the sixth mode for all the tool materials. The maximum eigen frequency (i.e. 1.3418E5 Hz) is generated in the ultrasonic tool which is made of tungsten carbide. In the harmonic analysis, the maximum von Mises stress is generated in the tool which is made of stainless steel, i.e. 233 MPa. No significant variation is observed for the proposed tool materials through harmonic analysis. Tungsten carbide is one of the appropriate materials for tool design followed by stainless steel and titanium due to its high axial mode of vibration.",Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,10.1109/ASET53988.2022.9735061
Advanced tools for unveiling nucleation in nanostructured glass-ceramics,"© 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Nucleation is of great interest to materials scientists, physicists, and chemists studying fundamental scientific aspects of this phenomenon, as well as engineers working to develop glass-ceramics. Fundamental research in this field is indispensable for understanding the nature of the glassy state and the development of new products such as nanostructured glass-ceramics. However, experimental results on nucleation in inorganic oxide (mostly silicate) glasses and their theoretical interpretation in the framework of various mathematical models are still the subjects of significant debate. Difficulties during the early studies of nucleation partly arose from restrictions in experimental tools employed to study micron-sized or larger crystals, which cannot be directly applied to study nuclei of critical sizes or medium-range order in the parent glass, which are on a length scale of a few nanometers. Advanced tools, e.g., transmission electron microscopy, anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering, small-angle neutron scattering, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, advanced optical spectroscopy, together with computational modelings provide critical insight into the complicated and rapidly changing environments in which nucleation happens. The new findings from these sophisticated techniques and modeling approaches helps us evaluate hypotheses, modify available models, and develop new nanostructured glass-ceramics. Therefore, this paper reviews state-of-the-art solutions in instrumental and modeling analyses to measure and ultimately control nucleation. We propose adopting these tools and future impactful research in this exciting and challenging open field.",Critical Reviews in Solid State and Materials Sciences,10.1109/ASET53988.2022.9734885
Detection and Localization of Small Defects in Large Glass-ceramics by Hybrid Macro and Micro Vision,"© MYU K.K.A method of hybrid macro and micro vision to detect and locate sub-millimeter defects in meter-sized glass-ceramics is proposed.

THE INFLUENCE OF RESIN CEMENT THICKNESSES ON SHEAR BOND STRENGTH OF THE CEMENT-ZIRCONIA,"© 2022 Polish Dental AssociationIntroduction: Zirconia is a polycrystalline ceramic with no glassy phase like other glass ceramics. To gain a suitable retention, zirconia present some inherent problems. Surface treatment of etched zirconia with hydrofluoric acid does not adequately roughen the surface for the purpose of retention, while grinding zirconia to create surface roughness is often used as an option to improve its' mechanical bonding. Objectives: The study examined the influence of resin cement thicknesses on shear bond strength of zirconia treated with a universal adhesive. Material and methods: Forty zirconia specimens were prepared, surface-treated with universal adhesive, and divided into 4 groups according to resin thicknesses (50, 80, 160, and 240 μm). All samples were stored in 37°C distilled water for 24 hours. Shear bond strength was performed using a universal testing machine at a 0.5 mm/min crosshead speed, until failure. Failure modes were analyzed using stereomicroscope at a magnification of ×50. Results were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison tests. Results: The shear bond strength for each group was 30.28 ± 3.09, 26.86 ± 2.21, 25.98 ± 2.96, and 18.22 ± 1.71, respectively, and 50 μm significantly showed highest bond strength than in other groups (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in bond strength between 80 μm and 160 μm (p > 0.05), while 240 μm significantly showed lowest bond strength than in other groups (p < 0.05). Adhesive failure was mostly found in all groups. Conclusions: Resin cement thicknesses had influence on zirconia shear bond strength treated with a universal adhesive. The thinner resin cement showed higher shear bond strength than the thicker resin cement thicknesses.",Journal of Stomatology,10.3290/j.jad.b2916451
Shear Bond Strength of Lithium Disilicate Bonded with Various Surface-Treated Titanium,"© 2022 Laongdao Amornwichitwech and Mali Palanuwech.Purpose. Retention is one of the most important factors for fixed dental prostheses, especially in implant dentistry. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to evaluate the level of shear bond strength between titanium (Ti) subjected to different surface treatments and lithium disilicate glass-ceramics. Materials and Methods. In this work, 90 titanium alloy specimens were divided into six groups as follows: the control group (CT), 50 μm alumina airborne-particle abrasion group (SB), silica-coated group (CJ), anodization group (AN), anodization followed by alumina 50 μm airborne-particle abrasion group (ANSB), and anodization followed by silica coating group (ANCJ). Titanium specimens were bonded to lithium disilicate specimens with resin cement (Multilink N). The specimens were restored in water at 37°C for 24 h, and then, shear bond strength (SBS) tests were performed using a universal testing machine (Shimadzu, Japan). The SBS values were statistically analyzed. The failure mode of the debonded titanium was classified after viewing the samples under a stereoscope. Results. The results demonstrated that the mean SBSs of CT and AN were significantly lower than those of the other groups (p<0.05). The SB group showed the highest SBS (29.47 ± 2.41 MPa); however, there was no significant difference between SB, ANSB, ANCJ, and CJ. The stereoscopic analysis demonstrated that the failure mode of AN was predominantly adhesive failure; whereas, the other groups showed cohesive and mixed failures. Conclusions. In this study, it was found that the surface treatment with 50 μm alumina airborne-particle abrasion, silica coating with Cojet™ sand, anodization followed by 50 μm alumina airborne-particle abrasion, and anodization followed by silica coating with Cojet™ sand improved the SBS between titanium and lithium disilicate luted with Multilink N resin cement.",International Journal of Dentistry,10.1007/978-3-030-89784-0_7
EFFECTS OF THE SiO2-B2O3 RATIO ON THE STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF B2O3-ZnO-SiO2-BaO-LiO2-Al2O3-Na2O-CaO PARENT GLASS AND GLASS-CERAMICS,"© 2022 University of Chemistry and Technology, Faculty of Environmental Technology. All rights reserved.The experimental results show that a decrease in the SiO2/B2O3 ration reduced the glass transition temperature, but had little effect on the crystallisation temperature. The basic glass powder pressed into strip samples were sintered at a temperature of 630 to 690 °C. With a decrease in the SiO2/B2O3 ratio, the structure of glass and glass-ceramics changed, and the same change also occurred in the crystal phase in the glass-ceramics. When the SiO2/B2O3 ratio was 0.29, the glass-ceramics sintered at 670 °C reached the best properties, including the bending strength, density, and acid resistance. When the SiO2/B2O3 ratio was 0.29, the coefficient of thermal expansion of the glass-ceramics sintered at different temperatures were maintained in the range of 6.3 – 7.2 × 10-6 K-1",Ceramics - Silikaty,10.1590/1807-3107bor-2022.vol36.0022
CAD-CAM resin-ceramic material wear: A systematic review,"© 2022 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: The increasing use of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) systems has led to the development of resin-ceramic materials that meet the requirements of minimally invasive dentistry, including the resin nanoceramic (RNC) and polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN). The wear characteristics of these materials are unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review was to compare the wear resistance of resin-ceramic materials when compared with one another or with lithium disilicate glass-ceramics. Material and methods: The PubMed, Scopus, and DOSS search engines were used to identify articles published between 2013 and 2021. Two independent researchers conducted the systematic review by following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and by following a combination of keywords. Results: Of a total of 310 articles, 26 were selected, including only 1 clinical study. Among these, 15 compared resin-ceramic materials with each other, while 11 compared resin-ceramic materials with lithium disilicate ceramics. Two types of wear were used to compare the materials: attrition and abrasion. The most commonly studied materials were 2 RNCs (Lava Ultimate and Cerasmart), 1 PICN (Vita Enamic), and 1 ceramic (IPS e.max CAD). Among the resin-ceramic materials, the PICN (Vita Enamic) showed less wear than the RNCs. Of the RNCs, Cerasmart had less attrition wear and less wear of the opposing teeth. Conclusions: Lithium disilicate glass-ceramics have a higher wear resistance than resin-ceramic materials, but they cause more wear of the opposing teeth.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1016/j.matpr.2021.11.491
Wear resistance of glass and carbon fibers/epoxy composites,"© 2022 IEEE.Fiber-reinforced polymer composite materials are slowly but substantially replacing traditional metallic materials due to their high specific strength and improved wear resistance. However, composites are still more expensive than traditional materials. In this work, composites fabricated from carbon fiber and glass have been compared for hardness and wear resistance. The FRP composites were prepared using hand lay-up technique. The results revealed that the hardness of pure epoxy composite was 83HV. However, it was 415.2 HV and 319.8HV for carbon and glass fiber composite respectively. The applied load has significant effect on the wear rate of both composites and it increase with the applied load. Furthermore, it was observed that carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites are more resistant to wear than glass fiber reinforced epoxy composites.","2022 Advances in Science and Engineering Technology International Conferences, ASET 2022",10.1039/d1ra08050d
Higher than one. Triggering crystallization in mold flux slag.,"© 2022 Associazione Italiana di Metallurgia. All rights reserved.Mold flux is a family of formulated materials for industrial application in cast steel production, exhibiting the primary characteristic of melting at working temperature, into a liquid slag with controlled rheological properties. It is relevant for the present study the fact that this molten slag, when cooled down, undergoes a crystallization/devitrification reaction, which is phenomenological triggered by the basicity index, I.B., calculated as CaO/SiO2(wt./wt.), equal or higher than 1. Thermodynamics and kinetics of this reaction have been thoroughly studied in the past. Nevertheless, an effective explanation of the mechanism of its triggering remains mostly unexplained. Indeed, a value of IB ≥ 1.0 corresponds to a molar ratio CaO/SiO2≥1.07, which is significantly less than 2.0, being that the ratio of the same components within the composition of the main crystallizing phase for this system. This consideration suggests that I.B. value is triggering some kinds of clustering phenomena in the liquid phase, which is then responsible for observed crystallization/ devitrification reaction. This hypothesis is of particular interest since this system is a typical calcium fluor-aluminosilicate glass, material that covers a wide field of application from glass-ceramics, electronic, optoelectronic to dental applications. Spectroscopic studies have shown that calcium fluoro-alumino-silicate glasses cannot be considered as structurally and compositionally homogeneous at the nanometer scale, mainly due to cluster formation of Ca-F structures. Moreover, it has been shown that metal cations mix non-randomly in the alumino-silicate glass structures, producing a well-defined local order. Phenomena of medium-intermediate range order in cation distribution of calcium silicates and calcium alumino-silicates glasses are long time studying topic, counting a substantial number of investigation methods and published research papers Then, supposing that this phenomenon of clustering is naturally relevant in mold flux related fluor-alumino-silicate glasses itšfs of particular interest to understand, as stated before, how specific values of I.B. can eventually trigger this and how this is related to primary crystallization reaction in this systems. The present study tries to assess the occurrence of this phenomenon in well-defined formulations of commerciallike mold fluxes. Based on an extensive investigation with DTA, DSC and XRD measurements, a possible mechanistic explanation is also suggested.",Metallurgia Italiana,10.1080/10426914.2022.2049300
Thermo-mechanical analysis of a glass-ceramic piston for potential use in combustion engines,"© 2022 IEEE.The temperature of combustion engine pistons, e.g., 370 °C, along with their high thermal coefficient of expansion, are limiting design factors. The use of ceramic in the majority of the present literature is directed toward exploring its potential as a coating only, i.e., a thermal barrier. This work, however, investigates the applicability of glass-ceramic as a construction material for the engine piston in replacement of its metallic conventional candidates. Firstly, in attempts to find the most suitable ceramic material, a selection screening of several grades is performed using ANSYS Granta Edupack software. Secondly, a thermo-mechanical analysis is performed to compare between glass-ceramic, Aluminum and stainless steel that can best fit the piston application. It was found that the maximum induced Von-Mises stresses are reduced by more than 200% when glass-ceramic was used. Similarly, the maximum deformation was seen to be extremely lower compared to Aluminum and stainless steel. Different other possible high-strength glass-ceramic materials are also discussed. Overall, the FEA outcomes in conjunction with the findings of high-strength glass-ceramics present an attractive foundation as future candidates to pistons potentially used in aerospace applications.","2022 Advances in Science and Engineering Technology International Conferences, ASET 2022",10.5802/crgeos.111

Influence of the Interface of Carbon Nanotube-Reinforced Aluminum Matrix Composites on the Mechanical Properties – a Review,"© The Author(s) 2022. Open Access.Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a good reinforcement for metal matrix composite materials; they can significantly improve the mechanical, wear-resistant, and heat-resistant properties of the materials. Due to the differences in the atomic structure and surface energy between CNTs and aluminum-based materials, the bonding interface effect that occurs when nanoscale CNTs are added to the aluminum alloy system as a reinforcement becomes more pronounced, and the bonding interface is important for the material mechanical performance. Firstly, a comparative analysis of the interface connection methods of four CNT-reinforced aluminum matrix composites is provided, and the combination mechanisms of various interface connection methods are explained. Secondly, the influence of several factors, including the preparation method and process as well as the state of the material, on the material bonding interface during the composite preparation process is analyzed. Furthermore, it is explained how the state of the bonding interface can be optimized by adopting appropriate technical and technological means. Through the study of the interface of CNT-reinforced aluminum-based composite materials, the influence of the interface on the overall performance of the composite material is determined, which provides directions and ideas for the preparation of future high-performance CNT-reinforced aluminum-based composite materials.",Archives of Foundry Engineering,10.1007/978-981-16-7282-8_42
Producing Particulate Composite Using 3D Printing Plastics Waste,"© 2022 IEEE.In this present paper, the mechanical characteristics of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), PP (polypropene), PVA (Poly(vinyl alcohol)),PLA (Polylactic acid), and nylon, composites reinforced with Nano-silica particles were studied and produced. Silica has features that allow its incorporation into polymer composites that lead to an improvement in the quality characteristics as well as better physical attributes. In order to create the composite material, different silica percentages were used in cooperation with twin extruders following that heat compression, and the results were quite promising. In general, it is noticeable that adding silica to polymers enhanced the strength tensile of the materials. When silica concentrations were high, the morphological study indicated that the particles were dispersed randomly and that agglomerates were formed as a result. When the amount of filler used in the samples was increased, the apparent density of the samples dropped as a result. Because of the inclusion of silica, the properties of the polymeric materials changed significantly. The qualities described in this research may also be utilized to further investigate the design process, transport and communication, and industrial techniques, with the goal of supporting the recyclability of waste material in a similar technique as it was originally created with the required characteristics.","2022 Advances in Science and Engineering Technology International Conferences, ASET 2022",10.1016/j.prosdent.2021.11.017
The Formation of a New Phase during Crystallization of TiO2-Doped Nd2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 Glasses,"© 2022 Indian Ceramic Society.Glasses with the general compositions xNd 2O3.20Al2O3.(80–x)SiO2 and 15Nd2O3.yAl2O3.(85–y)SiO2 (x = 10, 15, 20, and y = 20, 25, 30) were prepared by melting at 1550°C. The glasses also contained varying amounts of TiO2 as nucleating agent. The microstructural evolution of the undoped and TiO2-containing glass-ceramics was then studied. Crystallization of the glasses was feasible in the range 1000° to 1250°C. The crystallization rates were evaluated. TiO2 addition influenced only the growth rate and not the nucleation of the crystalline phases observed in this study. Glasses of higher SiO2 content showed a rise in growth rate. It was found that when TiO2 was present, a new unreported crystalline compound with the stoichiometric composition of TiO2.Nd2O3.Al2O3.2SiO2 was formed.",Transactions of the Indian Ceramic Society,10.1007/978-981-16-7787-8_11
Effect of Incorporation of Bioactive Glass-Ceramic into Self-etch Adhesives,"© This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. To view a copy of this license, visit http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/or send a letter to Creative Commons, PO Box 1866, Mountain View, CA 94042, USA.Purpose: This study evaluated the effect of incorporating different concentrations of biosilicate in an experimental self-etch adhesive (SE). Materials and Methods: Biosilicate microparticles (0, 2, 5, and 10 wt%) were incorporated into the primer, and degree of conversion (DC) and wettability were tested (one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s test, p < 0.05). The two best concentrations were selected (2% and 5%) for μTBS evaluation. Sound human molars (n=20) were sectioned into quarters and randomly assigned to 4 experimental groups: 1. experimental SE + 0% biosilicate (Exp0%; negative control); 2. experimental SE + 2% biosilicate (Exp2%); 3. experimental SE + 5% biosilicate (Exp5%); 4. AdheSE (Ivoclar Vivadent, positive control). After adhesive application, Filtek Z350 (3M Oral Care) composite was built up incrementally to 5 mm. Each quarter tooth was sectioned into sticks (0.9 mm2) and stored in distilled water (37°C) for 24 h, 6 months, or 1 year. After storage, sticks were submitted to μTBS (0.75 mm/min). The Ca:P ratio was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s correction, with statistical siginificance set at p < 0.05. Fracture patterns were observed under a digital microscope and adhesive interfaces with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: Exp2% presented the highest DC (p < 0.05), Exp5% exhibited the lowest μTBS (p < 0.05), and adhesive failures were predominant in all groups. TEM suggested remineralized areas in Exp2% and to a lesser degree in Exp5%. Exp2% and Exp5% showed a higher Ca:P ratio after aging (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The incorporation of biosilicate microparticles can improve the properties of self-etch adhesives. It increased the DC of the experimental adhesive as well as mineral deposition. However, the adhesive properties are concentration dependent, as a higher concentration of microparticles can adversely affect the mechanical properties of an adhesive.",Journal of Adhesive Dentistry,10.1080/17436753.2022.2045165
Theory of Nucleation and Glass Formation,"© 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.Nucleation is the first step in most first-order phase transitions, which include processes such as gas condensation, solidification, and the fabrication of glass ceramics. It also plays a key role in some biological processes and is fundamentally important in the pharmaceutical industry. Nucleation is commonly described within the framework of the classical nucleation theory, which was first developed to describe gas condensation almost 150 years ago. The classical theory is often called the liquid drop model, assuming the formation of small clusters of the new phase that have a sharp boundary with the original phase. It assumes a single nucleation pathway with clusters growing and shrinking by the addition or subtraction of single molecular units and adopts interface-limited kinetics. However, it is now becoming increasingly clear that nucleation is much more complicated than this. Experiments and computer modeling have demonstrated that the cluster interface is broad, not sharp. Studies of nucleation in colloidal and protein liquids, as well as in silicate glasses, have shown that there can be multiple nucleation pathways, not only one. Nucleation can couple with other phase transitions and ordering processes. The local atomic and chemical order in the original phase, even if it is a liquid or a glass, can couple to the nucleation barrier and may play a role in glass formation in some cases. Finally, studies of nucleation in liquids under a microgravity environment have revealed the important role that stirring can have in nucleation. These points will be briefly covered in this chapter, highlighting experimental and computer modeling results and discussing some new models for nucleation that take account of the diffuse interface and cases where long-range diffusion becomes comparable with the interfacial kinetics.","Minerals, Metals and Materials Series",10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.01.011
Bioactive glass-ceramic for bone tissue engineering: an in vitro and in vivo study focusing on osteoclasts,"© 2022. All Rights Reserved.Despite the crucial role of osteoclasts in the physiological process of bone repair, most bone tissue engineering strategies have focused on osteoblast-biomaterial interactions. Although Biosilicate® with two crystalline phases (BioS-2P) exhibits osteogenic properties and significant bone formation, its effects on osteoclasts are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects of BioS-2P on osteoclast differentiation and activity. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in osteoclastogenic medium (OCM) or OCM conditioned with BioS-2P (OCM-BioS-2P), and the cell morphology, viability, and osteoclast differentiation were evaluated. BioS-2P scaffolds were implanted into rat calvarial defects, and the bone tissue was evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after 2 and 4 weeks to determine the gene expressions of osteoclast markers and compare them with those of the bone grown in empty defects (Control). OCM-BioS-2P favored osteoclast viability and activity, as evidenced by an increase in the TRAP-positive cells and matrix resorption. The bone tissue grown on BioS-2P scaffolds exhibited higher expression of the osteoclast marker genes (Ctsk, Mmp 9, Rank) after 2 and 4 weeks and the RankL/Opg ratio after 2 weeks. Trap gene expression was lower at 2 weeks, and a higher number of TRAP-stained areas were observed in the newly formed bone on BioS-2P scaffolds at both 2 and 4 weeks compared to the Controls. These results enhanced our understanding of the role of bioactive glass-ceramics in bone repair, and highlighted their role in the modulation of osteoclastic activities and promotion of interactions between bone tissues and biomaterials.",Brazilian Oral Research,10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.01.008

Municipal solid waste incineration residues recycled for typical construction materials- a review,"© 2022 The Author(s).Focusing on the great potential of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) residues in the construction sector, the applications of recycling MSWI residues in construction materials are discussed in this review. Incineration is a promising method for managing the great quantity of municipal solid waste (MSW). Careful handling of incineration residues including fly ash, air pollution control (APC) residues, and bottom ash is required for this approach. The yield of these residues is large, and they contain many toxic and harmful substances. On the other hand, these residues contain valuable components such as SiO2, CaO, Al2O3, MgO, which are important components of building materials. Therefore, MSWI residues present huge opportunities for potential recycling and reuse in the construction and building industry. This paper summarized and discussed the application of MSWI residues in four typical building materials including cast stone, glass-ceramic, cement, and concrete. Before utilization, three types of pretreatment methods can be used to reduce the toxicity of the residues and improve the performance of the products. In addition, the current issues and the prospects of this field, and the environmental impacts of this application were discussed. It was concluded that MSWI residues can be used to prepare building materials after proper treatment which can improve the mechanical and chemical properties of the residues. The recycling can gain significant economic and environmental benefits at the same time. However, further researches on treatment methods for fine particles are needed.",RSC Advances,10.1080/02533839.2022.2034055
Process parameters effect on environmental sustainability of composites FFF technology,"© 2022 Taylor & Francis.The present study aims at investigating the effect of process parameters on environmental sustainability of 3D printing of short fiber-reinforced polymer composites. A preliminary study allowed defining the printing parameters, in terms of printing speed, extrusion temperature and layer thickness, which guarantee low energy consumption. Then, the environmental behavior of two 3D printable composite materials, glass fiber-reinforced (GlassPA) and carbon fiber-reinforced (CarbonPA) polyamide, was investigated using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology, to provide a comprehensive overview of the considered materials and to support the sustainable development of industrial additive manufacturing processes. The functional unit was chosen taking into account the mechanical properties of the two short fiber-reinforced composites. To this purpose, tensile and flexural tests were performed on specimens produced by Fused Filament Fabrication process to evaluate the mechanical properties of printed materials. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the different filament morphology affecting the materials performances. Experimental tests showed that CarbonPA exhibits mechanical performances higher than those of GlassPA. Due to the weight reduction that can be accomplished by means of carbon fibers, CarbonPA results the most environmentally friendly alternative in tensile loads applications. On the contrary, for flexural loads applications, GlassPA exhibits lower environmental footprint.",Materials and Manufacturing Processes,10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.01.030

All rights reserved.The paper presents experimental results obtained in the microwave field manufacturing of an economic and ecological glass-ceramic foam using as raw materials clear flat glass waste and coal fly ash and silicon carbide as a foaming agent. The experiments have shown that under the influence of microwave irradiation, foamed products have a good microstructural homogeneity, although it is known from the literature that the flat glass is not suitable for a foaming with uniform pore distribution. The optimal sample of glass-ceramic foam sintered at 977 ºC had thermal insulation properties (apparent density of 0.42 g/cm3 and thermal conductivity of 0.085 W/m·K) and high compressive strength of 2.4 MPa, being suitable for using as a thermal insulation building material. The product has the required characteristics of a thermal insulation material used in the field of construction and industrial. This material is a replacement for those commonly used. The advantages of using this product are: the low cost of the raw material consisting of a waste and an industrial by-product, the favorable ecological consequences and the low energy consumption of the unconventional manufacturing process.","UPB Scientific Bulletin, Series B: Chemistry and Materials Science",10.1117/12.2624491

Microshear bond strength of resin cement to glass-ceramics after intaglio surface staining,"© 2021 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Applying stains to the intaglio surface of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) monolithic ceramic restorations has been proposed as an option to help mask darkened substrates. However, little is known about the effects of this procedure on the adhesion between the resin cement and the ceramic. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of intaglio surface staining on the microshear bond strength between 2 CAD-CAM ceramics and a resin cement. Material and methods: Lithium disilicate (Gmax) and leucite-reinforced (Gpress) ceramic blocks were sectioned, crystalized when indicated, and polished. They received either none, 1, or 2 layers of ceramic stains and a glaze liquid mixture followed by a firing cycle. The surfaces of groups Gmax0, Gmax1, and Gmax2 were etched with 9% hydrofluoric acid etching (HF) for 20 seconds, and those of groups Gpress0 and Gpress1 were etched for 60 seconds. After rinsing and drying, a ceramic primer was applied and air-dried. Resin cement rods (n=24 per group) were built from a silicone mold. Specimens were stored in distilled water for 24 hours before microshear bond testing. Failure mode was observed under a digital microscope. Data were analyzed by using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests (α=.05). Results: Intaglio staining negatively affected the microshear bond strength for both ceramics. A significant difference was observed between Gmax1 (3.5 ±1.73 MPa) and Gmax2 (3.7 ±2.1 MPa) when compared with Gmax0 (14.2 ±4.4 MPa) and also between GPress0 (25.7 ±5.1 MPa) and Gpress1 (1.8 ±2.7 MPa). No difference was observed between 1 and 2 stain layers for Gmax. Most failures were adhesive for Gmax0, mixed for Gpress, and cohesive within the stain layer for experimental groups. Conclusions: Intaglio surface staining with a stain and glaze mixture caused a significant reduction in bond strength between resin cement and both ceramics tested.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.14704/nq.2022.20.2.NQ22026

Strengthen the bonding of self-glazed zirconia to enamel by sol–gel coating,"© 2022 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining. Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.Sol–gel coating technology was applied to modify the bonding surface of self-glazed zirconia (SZ). Its effect on the bond strength of SZ to enamel was evaluated in vitro in comparison with the conventional milled zirconia treated by airborne-particle abrasion (CZa) and the heat-pressed lithium disilicate glass-ceramics treated by etching and silanization (LDe). All ceramic specimens were bonded to the etched bovine enamel with adhesive resin cement. Shear bond strength of both sol–gel coated SZ groups with different strategies (SZc1 and SZc2) was 20.00 ± 7.07 MPa and 18.32 ± 3.63 MPa, respectively, which was comparable to that of LDe, 18.44 ± 2.27 MPa (p > 0.05) and significantly higher than that of CZa, 11.72 ± 1.48 MPa, and SZ, 3.06 ± 1.66 MPa (p < 0.05). Lots of voids between zirconia clusters were observed on the bonding surface of SZc1, yet that of SZc2 showed homogeneous honeycomb nanoporous structure. All groups exhibited mixed failure except SZ, and the fracture surfaces of SZc1, SZc2, and LDe showed better wettability than CZa. Sol–gel coating could improve the bond strength of SZ to enamel, and the sol–gel coated SZ might have the potential to make minimally invasive restorations.",Advances in Applied Ceramics,10.1016/j.nanoms.2022.01.002
Effect of universal adhesives and self-etch ceramic primers on bond strength to glass ceramics: A systematic review and meta-analysis of in vitro studies,"© 2022 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: To simplify dental procedures, multicomponent products such as universal adhesives and self-etch ceramic primers have been recommended for glass-ceramic bonding; however, studies have shown a wide range of results. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the in vitro bond strength promoted by hydrofluoric acid+silane-containing universal adhesives and a self-etch ceramic primer to glass-ceramics and compare it with that of conventional treatments. Material and methods: A systematic search was conducted in the PubMed/Medline, Scopus, LILACS, and ISI Web of Science databases up to April 2021. In vitro studies assessing the resin-mediated bond to glass-ceramics by using a self-etch ceramic primer and hydrofluoric acid+silane-containing universal adhesives and/or compared with traditional hydrofluoric acid+glass-ceramic primers were included. Selection of studies, data extraction, and risk-of-bias analysis were performed. Statistical analysis was performed by using a review management software program using a random effects model (α=.05). Results: A total of 33 studies were included in the qualitative analysis and 26 studies in the quantitative analysis. Bond strength to lithium disilicate ceramic was higher when a hydrofluoric acid+glass-ceramic primer was used than when using a hydrofluoric acid+silane-containing universal adhesive (P<.05), except when 9% to 10% acid concentration was used in combination with static aging (P=.100). A self-etch ceramic primer promoted bond strength values to lithium disilicate that were similar to those of the hydrofluoric acid+glass-ceramic primer (P>.100). Conclusions: Hydrofluoric acid+silane-containing universal adhesive was not as effective as the hydrofluoric acid+glass-ceramic primer in promoting bond strength to glass-ceramic. Bond strength values generated by a self-etch ceramic primer to glass-ceramic were similar to those generated by the conventional treatment.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1080/13287982.2022.2038406
Efficacy of two polishing systems in reestablishing the surface smoothness of posterior monolithic lithium disilicate restorations: One-year results of a split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial,"© 2022 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Selecting the optimal polishing procedure to reestablish surface smoothness after occlusal adjustment is essential for the long-term success of glass-ceramic restorations. While in vitro studies have shown different effective polishing protocols, clinical trials are lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this split-mouth controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 polishing systems in reestablishing the surface smoothness of posterior monolithic lithium disilicate ceramic restorations. Material and methods: Ninety-six restorations that required occlusal adjustment after bonding were randomized into 2 groups: Forty-eight restorations were polished by using the Exa Cerapol polishing kit, and the other 48 restorations were polished by using the Shofu polishing kit. The restorations were replicated with epoxy resin at 3 study times—after bonding (t1), after occlusal adjustment (t2), and after polishing (t3)—for quantitative roughness analysis (Ra). Representative specimens from each group were qualitatively analyzed by using a confocal laser microscope. Clinical analyses were performed after the polishing procedure and at 30, 180, and 365 days after the polishing procedure by following the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. ANOVA and the Tukey multiple comparisons parametric tests were computed (α=.05). The Kaplan-Meier test was used to analyze the survival rate of restorations. Results: No statistically significant difference was found between the Exa Cerapol and Shofu groups (P=.086). A statistically significant difference was found between study times t1 and t2 and between t2 and t3 (both P<.001) in both experimental groups. No statistically significant difference was found between study times t1 and t3 (P=.181) in either experimental group. For the clinical criterion “integrity of restorations,” all the elements analyzed indicated an alfa grade at all study times. The survival rate of the restorations was 100%. Conclusions: Both polishing kits were effective in reestablishing the surface smoothness of restorations after occlusal adjustment.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1007/978-981-16-8129-5_104

Mechanical characterization and morphological behavior of a novel composite of ABS polymer strengthened by cellulose,"© 2022 The Chinese Institute of Engineers.The present work is a novel investigation of the mechanical behavior of a fabricated cellulose-fiber-reinforced acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymer matrix composite. Polymer matrix composite (PMC) samples were prepared by varying ratios of ABS and cellulose weight percentages such as pure ABS, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, and 50:50. In comparison with pure ABS, the maximum improvements of mechanical behaviors observed from the fabricated materials are 22.22% of flexural strength, 51.11% of impact strength, 15% of hardness, and 50% of compression strength; also, morphological studies like X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy were carried out, and their correlations were obtained for similar ABS matrix composite materials. The addition of 20 weight percent of cellulose reinforcement with 80 weight percentage of the ABS matrix composite improved the flexural strength to 63MPa, impact strength to 34 J/m2,, hardness to 83.1, and shore D and compressive strength to 18 MPa. DMA (Dynamic Mechanical Analysis) analysis of the fabricated specimen showed increased storage modulus and reduced damping factor over the pure ABS matrix material.

Effect of partially stabilized zirconia thickness on the translucency and microhardness of resin cement,"© 2022 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Partially stabilized zirconia has been introduced as a more translucent iteration. However, knowledge of the effect of the thickness of partially stabilized zirconia on the microhardness of resin cement is sparse. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of thickness and material type on the translucency of partially stabilized zirconia and the microhardness of the resin cement polymerized beneath. Material and methods: Specimens were prepared from 2 translucent zirconias with different yttrium content (Ceramil Zolid HT+ [HT] and Ceramil Zolid FX [SHT]) and a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (e.max CAD [EX]) of different thicknesses (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mm) (n=10). Color coordinates were recorded by using a spectrophotometer, and the relative translucency parameter (RTP) was calculated by using the CIEDE2000 formula. The microhardness of the resin cement polymerized under ceramic specimens was measured. Two-way analysis of variance, the Tukey honestly significant difference, and independent samples t tests were used to analyze the data (α=.05). Results: Material type (P<.001), thickness (P<.001), and their interaction significantly affected the RTP (P=.001) and hardness values (P<.001). Regardless of the thickness, EX had the highest RTP (P≤.027), and the resin cements polymerized under EX showed the highest microhardness (P≤.002). However, the difference between HT and SHT for RTP (P≥.082) and resin cement hardness (P≥.984) was not significant. Specimens of 0.5 mm resulted in higher RTP (P≤.001) and resin cement hardness (P≤.006) than the 1.5- and 2-mm specimens of each ceramic. Conclusions: Increasing material thickness reduced the translucency of the partially stabilized zirconia and the hardness of the resin cements polymerized beneath.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1134/S0036023622010053
Influence of Simulated Oral Conditions on Different Pretreatment Methods for the Repair of Glass-Ceramic Restorations,"© 2022, Journal of Adhesive Dentistry. All Rights Reserved.Purpose: The present study investigated the influence of simulated intraoral conditions (increased temperature and humidity) on two different surface pretreatment methods to repair a lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic (LDS).Materials and Methods: A total of 540 rectangular lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic bars were manufactured (3×7×9 mm; IPS e.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent). Further specimen preparation was performed in an incubator with controlled relative humidity (RH) and temperature to simulate three different environmental settings: laboratory conditions (LC, n = 180, 23°C, 50% RH), rubber-dam conditions (RC, n = 180, 30°C, 50% RH) or oral conditions (OC, n=180, 32°C, 95±5% RH). One-third of the bars under each condition (n=60) were grit blasted (GBL) with alumina (35 μm at 1 bar pressure for 10 s and a working distance of 4±1cm) and primed (60 s, Monobond Plus, Ivoclar Vivadent). Another third (n=60) were pretreated with a self-etching glass-ceramic primer (MEP, Monobond Etch & Prime, Ivoclar Vivadent). One group without surface pretreatment (n=60, NoPT) served as a control. All pre treated surfaces were coated with Heliobond (Ivoclar Vivadent). Two bars from the same pretreatment method were luted perpendicular to each other with a resin composite to form a square adhesion area of 9 mm2(TetricEvo Ceram, Ivoclar Vivadent), and light cured for 20 s on each side (1200 mW/cm2, Bluephase 20i, Ivoclar Vivadent). All specimens were stored for 24 h in distilled water at 37°C. Half of the specimens from each environmental set ting and pretreatment method (n=15) were thermocycled (TC, 5000 cycles, 5/55°C, 30-s dwell time), and tensile bond strength (TBS) testing was performed for all groups using an x-bar rope-assisted set-up. Data were statisti cally analyzed using two-way ANOVA (α=0.05) with Bonferroni adjustment.Results Regardless of the environmental and storage conditions (24 h or TC), MEP showed a significantly higher mean TBS than GBL. A decrease in TBS was recorded in specimens under OC compared to RC and LC for both pre treatment methods independent of the storage condition. No significant difference in mean TBS was found be tween RC and LC within the MEP pretreatment group for the 24 h stored and thermocycled specimens. For all MEPs and GBLs, TC reduced the mean TBS in all environmental conditions. The NoPT groups showed no adhesion regardless of environmental or storage conditions.Conclusions: Increased temperature and high humidity significantly reduced TBS. However, MEP was less sensitive to environmental influences than GBL, which makes it a promising candidate for intraoral ceramic repair. These findings suggest that clinical intraoral repair of lithium-disilicate glass-ceramics should be performed using a rub ber-dam, primarily when using GBL.",Journal of Adhesive Dentistry,10.1103/PhysRevE.105.014609

Effect of the Spectroscopic Parameters of the Processed Material and Polishing Powder on the Parameters of Polishing of Optical Surfaces,"© 2022, Allerton Press, Inc.Abstract: As found from the results of studying the effect of spectroscopic parameters of the processed material and polishing powder on the efficiency of polishing and the roughness of polished surfaces of parts made of optical glass, glass ceramics, optical and semiconductor crystals, ceramics, and polystyrene, the intensity of removal of the processed material increases linearly with an increase in the number of molecular fragments in the sludge particle removed from the treated surface and decreases with an increase in the ratio of natural oscillation frequencies of molecular fragments in the particles of the polishing powder and treated material. It is shown that the roughness parameters of polished surfaces decrease linearly with an increase in this ratio. It is established that the wear intensity of the polishing powder decreases linearly with an increase in the ratio between the frequencies of oscillation of molecular fragments in the processed material and polishing powder particles.",Journal of Superhard Materials,10.15541/jim20210480
Accuracy of Different Complete-Arch Digital Scanning Techniques with a Combined Healing Abutment–Scan Body System,"© 2022 by Quintessence Publishing Co IncPurpose: Investigate the effects of three different complete-arch digital implant scanning techniques used with a combined healing abutment–scan body (CHA-SB) system on the accuracy (trueness and precision) and scan time. Materials and Methods: A poly(methyl methacrylate) master model simulating an edentulous maxilla was fabricated with four parallelly inserted dental implants. A CHA-SB system was attached to each implant. The model surface was scanned using a structured blue light industrial extraoral scanner to achieve a reference model standard tessellation language ﬁle (MRM-STL). Three different scanning techniques—(1) conventional technique with unmodiﬁed master model, (2) scan body splinting technique using orthodontic elastic ligatures and plastic splint materials, and (3) land-marking technique using pyramid-shaped glass-ceramic markers—were performed. Fourteen consecutive digital scans were made by using an intraoral scanner (IOS) for each technique, converted to an STL ﬁle, and superimposed on the MRM-STL. Trueness and precision were calculated for each technique. The scan time was also recorded. The data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey honest signiﬁcant difference (HSD) tests (α =.05). Results: Effects of different scanning techniques on the trueness (distance and angular deviations; P <.001) and scan time (P =.002) were statistically signiﬁcant. For precision, different scanning techniques had only a signiﬁcant effect on the distance deviation (P <.001). Conclusion: Regarding trueness and precision, none of the scanning techniques was superior to others. The scan body splinting technique led to signiﬁcantly less scan time",International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Implants,10.1016/j.omx.2022.100140

EAO Position Paper: Material Selection for Implant-Supported Restorations,"© 2022 Quintessence Publishing Co Inc. All Rights Reserved.In recent years, numerous new dental materials have been introduced as alternatives to metal-ceramics for restorations on teeth and implants. This position paper presents the current evidence and respective clinical recommendations of the European Association for Osseointegration (EAO), one of the scientific partners of the International Journal of Prosthodontics, on material selection for single crowns (SCs) and multiple-unit implant-supported fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). Metal-ceramic restorations can be utilized in most clinical indications and are preferred to ceramic restorations in incidences such as long clinical implant crowns; cantilever implant restorations where one implant is supporting two crowns; implant-supported FDPs with extension units extending more than 7 to 8 mm (premolar size); implant-supported FDPs with more than two pontics; and implant-supported FDPs with small connector diameters due to limited intraocclusal space. Veneered or monolithic zirconia-ceramic and veneered or monolithic reinforced glass-ceramic implant-supported SCs are indicated for most SC cases in both the anterior and posterior areas. Today, implant-supported zirconia-ceramic FDPs that are conventionally veneered cannot be considered the material of first priority due to the pronounced risk for fracture of the framework and catastrophic fracture of the veneering material. Monolithic zirconia FDPs are a promising alternative to veneered implant-supported zirconia-ceramic FDPs. The mechanical stability of the translucent and shaded zirconia differs significantly between the grades of translucency. This must always be considered when clinical indications are recommended. As this specific area of prosthodontics is evolving fast, numerous studies evaluating different material options in implant prosthodontics are currently performed worldwide, and future consensus meetings will refine the present recommendations. The EAO will therefore regularly publish updated position papers on relevant topics.",International Journal of Prosthodontics,10.1088/2053-1591/ac4a2e

Ternary combined industrial wastes for non-fired brick,"© 2022 Engineers Australia.The demand for bricks in South Asia is increasing significantly due to growth in the construction sector. Bricks produced using traditional firing technique and fertile clay contribute significantly to some of the worst air pollution in the world. Therefore, the utilisation of other environment-friendly alternative to conventional bricks is considered an urgent need to conserve a clean environment and help in saving its fertile soil. This research aimed to explore geopolymerisation technique with ternary combined industrial waste/by-products as binders including high volume Ladle Furnace Slag (LFS), Fly ash and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) to produce non-fired and clay-free brick alternatives. The first two byproducts are locally produced in the related iron and power industry while GGBS are being imported by the cement industry. The results indicated that all the prepared samples conform to the minimum compressive strength requirement of 20.7 MPa and maximum water absorption rate of 17% for common brick with severe weathering as per ASTM C62. This highly promising performance pronounced the use of locally available high volume LFS and other industrial waste/by-products materials in non-fired building block production to achieve a cleaner, environmental-friendly sustainable society as well as a sustainable route for industrial waste management.",Australian Journal of Structural Engineering,10.1007/s11015-022-01260-y
Under Insulation Microwave Non-destructive Testing Using Dual-Ridges Open-Ended Rectangular Waveguide,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.Composite materials emerged as a promising class of engineering materials, providing new prospects for modern technology. However, manufacturing defects, including the improper laying of laminae, low curing temperature and pressure applied to the insulation materials can cause a growth of delamination between the insulation and the metal surface and crack of metal. Such defects could dramatically reduce the strength and stiffness after impact. Hence, it becomes essential to report and repair the area non-destructively before it spreads any further. In this paper, a novel of microwave non-destructive testing (NDT) technique for composite coatings is proposed. This technique is based on scanning the surface of the coating with a dual-ridges open-ended rectangular waveguide. The reflection coefficient is analysed. Here, a sample with miniatured delamination is scanned using rectangular waveguides operating from 6.5 to 18 GHz. After applying Wavelet transform to the waveguide reflection coefficient, the surface plot showed the delamination with significantly better depth resolution. The results reported in the paper illustrates the advantages of Wavelet transform to picturise the delamination depth. The information of depth defects can be used to further develop improved methods for maintenance schedule involving significant localised damage and for checking in a production quality control system.",Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,10.1017/aer.2021.121
Effect of different endodontic access preparations on the biomechanical behavior of lithium disilicate and resin nanoceramic onlay restorations: An in vitro and 3D finite element analysis study,"© 2022 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: The effect of different sizes of endodontic access preparations on the performance of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic and resin nanoceramic onlay restorations is unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro and 3D finite element analysis study was to assess the effect of a conservative endodontic access cavity and a traditional endodontic access cavity on the fracture resistance and stress distribution of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic and resin nanoceramic onlays. Material and methods: Sixty caries-free human mandibular molars were anatomically prepared for onlays and divided into 6 groups. After restoration with a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (N=30) or resin nanoceramic (N=30), each material was further divided into traditional or conservative endodontic access cavity or intact tooth groups. After endodontic therapy and thermocycling, all specimens were submitted to a cycle fatigue test and then loaded until fracture. Failure type and location after debonding or fracture were classified and recorded. Furthermore, stress distribution in the 6 models was analyzed by using a finite element analysis software program. The data were compared by using a 2-way ANOVA test and the Tukey post hoc test (α=.05). The Weibull modulus and Weibull failure probabilities were also estimated for each group. Results: The lithium disilicate glass-ceramic onlays had lower fracture resistance values than the resin nanoceramic onlays in both the traditional and conservative endodontic access cavity groups (P<.05). The fracture resistance of the 2 materials for onlays with endodontic access was significantly lower than that for the intact restorations (P<.05). No significant difference was found between the fracture resistance of Lava Ultimate restorations with traditional endodontic access and conservative endodontic access, while the fracture resistance of EMAX restorations with traditional endodontic access was significantly lower than that of restorations with conservative endodontic access (P<.05). A higher percentage of irreparable fractures was found in the 3 resin nanoceramic restoration groups. The von Mises stresses were higher in the lithium disilicate glass-ceramic restorations than in the resin nanoceramic restorations with the same access cavities. The von Mises stresses in the tooth structure were higher with the resin nanoceramic restorations than with the lithium disilicate glass-ceramic restorations with the same access cavities. Conclusions: An endodontic access cavity had more influence on the lithium disilicate glass-ceramic onlays than on the resin nanoceramic onlays, and a traditional endodontic access cavity significantly decreased the fracture resistance of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic onlays.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,10.1016/j.jtice.2022.104223
Flexural Strength of Vitreous Ceramics Based on Lithium Disilicate and Lithium Silicate Reinforced with Zirconia for CAD/CAM,"© 2022 Hazel P. R. Corado et al.The dental prosthesis market is rapidly evolving to meet patient and clinical demands. These new materials must have good flexural strength, toughness, aesthetic properties, and reliability in performance for structural applications. The present work aimed to compare the bending strength of 4 types of chairside lithium disilicate (Li2Si2O5) glass-ceramics used for dental prosthesis and to analyze the influence of heat treatment on the transformation of lithium metasilicate (Li2SiO3) into lithium disilicate. The three-ball test for the biaxial flexion test (B3B) was used. Weibull statistical analysis was used, and it showed that samples with a higher percentage of zirconia have a greater tendency to fail. The flexion tests showed that the addition of more than 10% of zirconia reduced the flexural strength. The heat treatment process improves and provides greater mechanical strength. The XRD results indicated that the samples with the lowest percentage of zirconia exhibited greater crystallinity and corroborated the microstructural analysis. SEM analyses showed a greater amount and elongated crystals of lithium disilicate when comparing samples with a higher percentage of zirconia. Therefore, samples with lower zirconia showed greater flexural strength than samples with higher additions of zirconia.",International Journal of Biomaterials,10.1109/TAP.2021.3102037
Bioglass 45S5 Doped with Zirconium Dioxide: Preparation and Properties,"© 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.Abstract: A method for synthesis of bioactive glass and glass ceramics by doping Bioglass 45S5 with zirconium dioxide has been proposed. The method is based on pyrolysis of a mixture of organic solutions containing sodium oleate, calcium oleate, tetraethoxysilane, tributyl phosphate, and zirconyl oleate. Doping in a wide range (5–60 wt % ZrO2) has been employed. Effect of zirconium dioxide on glass properties has been studied by X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray electron spectroscopy, extremal solutions, and immersion in SBF. The doping has been found to change physical and chemical properties of Bioglass 45S5. X-ray amorphous state and reduced chemical solubility retain on increase in zirconium dioxide content in glass up to 10 wt %. Doping above 10 wt % partially removes sodium and silicon from glass network to insoluble crystalline phase, which enhances chemical solubility of resultant glass ceramics. No loss of bioactive properties of the material has been observed in this case. A method for preparing dense glass ceramics based on ZrO2 has been proposed, where Bioglass 45S5 behaves as a bioactive phase. The material shows strength >450 MPa and can be used in reconstructive surgery as loadable implants.",Russian Journal of Inorganic Chemistry,10.1016/j.yofte.2022.102821
Mediated interactions between rigid inclusions in two-dimensional elastic or fluid films,"© 2022 American Physical SocietyInteractions between rigid inclusions in continuous three-dimensional linearly elastic solids and low-Reynolds-number viscous fluids have largely been quantified in the past. Prime example systems are given by functionalized elastic composite materials or fluid colloidal suspensions. Here, we address the significantly less frequently studied situation of rigid inclusions in two-dimensional elastic or low-Reynolds-number fluid films. We concentrate on the situation in which disklike inclusions remain well separated from each other and do not get into contact. Specifically, we demonstrate and explain that the logarithmic divergence of the associated Green's function is removed in the absence of net external forces on the inclusions, in line with physical intuition. For instance, this situation applies when only pairwise mutual interactions between the inclusions prevail. Our results will support, for example, investigations on membranes functionalized by appropriate inclusions, both of technical or biological origin, or the dynamics of active microswimmers in appropriately prepared thin films.",Physical Review E,10.1111/jerd.12877
The Preparation of Inorganic Materials to Consume and Stabilize Chromium-Containing Waste: A Review,"© 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.Currently, a large amount of chromium-containing solid waste (CCSW) is still accumulating, and has caused a series of ecological problems that are difficult to solve. Inorganic materials have been extensively studied for their capability to consume CCSW. This paper reviews the research on four groups of inorganic materials: glass ceramics, sintering ceramics, cement, and geopolymers. Furthermore, their properties, chromium solidification ability, and mechanism are summarized. Based on these experimental data and theories, future research in the field will likely focus on the following aspects: (1) establishing a systematic database of inorganic materials used to treat CCSW, comprehensively considering their chromium solidification ability and maximum waste consumption; (2) saving energy, simplifying the processes, and generating products with high added value; and (3) investigating the long-term chromium-leaching behavior of inorganic materials in different environments in order to improve the safety evaluation of materials prepared from CCSW.",JOM,10.1063/5.0076106
Synthesis of Zn0.4(CuGa)0.3Ga2S4/CdS Photocatalyst for CO2 Reduction Zn0.4(CuGa)0.3Ga2S4/CdS光催化材料的制备及其CO2还原性能,"© 2022, Science Press. All right reserved.Conversion of CO2 into fuels by photocatalysis is promising in solving the energy crisis and the greenhouse effect. Among various photocatalytic materials, Zn1-2x(CuGa)xGa2S4 materials possess visible light response and high conduction band potential, which are ideal CO2 reduction materials from thermodynamics aspect. However, their photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity is still low which is urgent to improve its activity in terms of kinetics. In this study, Zn0.4(CuGa)0.3Ga2S4 was synthesized and composited with CdS nanoparticles with different proportions to form Zn0.4(CuGa)0.3Ga2S4/CdS heterojunction photocatalysts. A series of characterizations suggest that CdS is uniformly grown on surface of Zn0.4(CuGa)0.3Ga2S4 microcrystals to form Z-scheme type all-solid heterojunction composite materials. Such a structure effectively suppresses the recombination of electron-hole pairs and improves the photocatalytic performance. In the solution CO2 reduction system, the as-prepared Zn0.4(CuGa)0.3Ga2S4/CdS can effectively reduce CO2 into CO under visible light irradiation. The optimal molar ratio of Zn0.4(CuGa)0.3Ga2S4 and CdS in composite materials is 2 : 1, whose photocatalytic performance is 1.7 times of that of Zn0.4(CuGa)0.3Ga2S4/ CdS and 1.6 times of that of CdS. This work constructs all solid Z-scheme type Zn0.4(CuGa)0.3Ga2S4/CdS heterojunction materials with enhanced photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction, which is promising for designing novel photocatalysts in the field of artificial photosynthesis.",Wuji Cailiao Xuebao/Journal of Inorganic Materials,10.1590/0103-6440202103951
"A review on rare-earth activated SnO2-based photonic structures: Synthesis, fabrication and photoluminescence properties","© 2022Rare-earth-activated photonic structures are fundamental actors in widespread applications such as luminescence sources, lasers, integrated photonics, solar cells, biomedical sensors and imaging, biomarkers, and theragnostics. However, there are several critical problems to face, concerning the quantum yield of the rare-earth (RE) based photonic systems such as: low absorption cross-section of rare-earths, physical and chemical clusterings, and non-radiative relaxation processes. Exploiting semiconductors as RE host-sensitizers is among appealing approaches to overcome these matters. By incorporating rare-earth ions in semiconductor nanocrystals, several advantages concerning the quantum yield of the systems can be achieved: (i) high absorption and emission cross-sections, (ii) reduction of the non-radiative relaxation processes, and (iii) tailoring of the ion-ion interaction by the control of the rare-earth ion partition. In this review paper, a survey on the investigation of SnO2 nanocrystals, a wide bandgap semiconductor, as luminescence sensitizers for a range of rare-earth ions such as erbium (Er3+), europium (Eu3+), samarium (Sm3+), terbium (Tb3+), holmium (Ho3+), neodymium (Nd3+), and ytterbium (Yb3+) is provided. Photoluminescence measurements of various rare-earth-doped SnO2 thin films or nanoparticles, and SiO2–SnO2 glass-ceramic systems are presented to put in evidence the role of SnO2 nanocrystals as efficient REs sensitizers. Synthesis and fabrication methods to obtain the rare-earth activated SnO2-based photonic structures are also summarized.",Optical Materials: X,10.1680/jsuin.21.00077
Biosafety evaluation of Li2Si2O5whisker-reinforced glass-ceramics,"© 2022 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.Lithium disilicate (Li2Si2O5) glass-ceramic is a commonly used dental ceramic material. In this study, Li2Si2O5 whiskers were prepared by the hydrothermal method, mixed with Li2Si2O5 glass powders, and Li2Si2O5 whisker-reinforced glass-ceramics were prepared by reaction sintering. The biosafety of the new Li2Si2O5 glass-ceramics were evaluated by in vitro cytotoxicity, hemolysis, oral mucosal irritation, acute systemic toxicity, and subacute systemic toxicity (oral route) tests according to ISO 7405/ISO 10993 standards. The cytotoxicity test results showed that the cell growth of the experimental group was good, and the cell number and morphology were not significantly different from those of the blank group (P> 0.05). The toxicity grading for both experimental and blank control groups were 0. The hemolysis rate of the material was 1.25%, which indicated that it did not cause hemolytic reaction. The material was non-irritating to the oral mucosa. In acute systemic toxicity test, animals in the experimental group showed increased body weight, moved freely, with no signs of poisoning. The food utilization rate and relative growth rate (change of the weight) of rats in the subacute systemic toxicity test were not statistically different from those of the control group (P > 0.05). Preliminary evaluation of the biosafety of the Li2Si2O5 whisker-reinforced glass-ceramics showed that it met the existing regulatory standards, and further biosafety experiments can be conducted, following which the material may be expected to be applied in clinical practice.",Biomedical Materials (Bristol),10.3390/cryst12010109
Development of Al-SiC composite material from rice husk and its parametric assessment,"© 2022 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.In this research work, the development of Al-SiC composite material from rice husk and its parametric assessment is done using a CNC milling machine. They are further surface characterized, and mechanical properties such as BET surface area, SEM-EDX, and XRD, fracture toughness, tensile, and bending strength are studied. The machinability of the components is investigated for selected values of input-output parameters. Three castings, each with different particulate reinforcement combinations, are made with aluminum alloy (6061) using the stir casting method. BET surface area of extracted silica and Al-SiC composite material was found 374 m2 g-1 and 150 m2 g-1, respectively. From results of BET surface area revealed that silica obtained from rice husk is more heterogeneous with a large surface area. A heterogeneous surface with larger pores was found through SEM images. XRD diffraction peaks show changes of amorphous silica into crystallinity in the composite material. The results also indicate that fracture toughness is very good at low temperatures and good machinability on CNC milling machines makes it suitable for aerospace applications.",Materials Research Express,10.1007/s00289-022-04087-4
Performance Evaluation of Rotational-Magnetorheological Glass–Ceramic Polishing (R-MRGP) Process Setups,"© 2022, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.Ultrafine glass–ceramic polishing is very challenging due to structural inconsistencies, chemical inhomogeneity and high stiffness. In the modern optics sectors, glass–ceramics are extensively used. In the present study, two different experimental setups of rotational-magnetorheological glass–ceramic polishing (R-MRGP) process are used to super-finish the complex freeform curved profiles of the glass–ceramic workpiece. After polishing, the performance of both R-MRGP process setups is compared in terms of uniformity in surface roughness, surface reflectance characteristics, surface topographical images and material removal rate (MRR). Further, magnetostatics fluid-flow analysis is performed for both R-MRGP process setups to study the distributions of magnetic flux density (MFD), axial velocity and shear stress along the glass–ceramic profile. This finite element analysis (FEA) helps in recognizing the polishing capability of R-MRGP process setups. In the current study, finishing force analysis is also performed to develop a theoretical model for predicting and comparing the obtained MRR in both R-MRGP process setups. The final outcome demonstrates that the workpiece has an excellent surface quality, with a minimum achieved roughness of 1.91 nm after using the R-MRGP process setup-II. The versatility of the R-MRGP process makes it a viable option for ultra-precision polishing of glass–ceramics.",Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering,10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.1048.65

An extended invariant approach to laminate failure of fibre-reinforced polymer structures,"© The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of Royal Aeronautical Society.This paper presents the extension and validation of omni-failure envelopes for first-ply failure (FPF) and last-ply failure (LPF) analysis of advanced composite materials under general three-dimensional (3D) stress states. Phenomenological failure criteria based on invariant structural tensors are implemented to address failure events in multidirectional laminates using the ""omni strain failure envelope""concept. This concept enables the generation of safe predictions of FPF and LPF of composite laminates, providing reliable and fast laminate failure indications that can be particularly useful as a design tool for conceptual and preliminary design of composite structures. The proposed extended omni strain failure envelopes allow not only identification of the controlling plies for FPF and LPF, but also of the controlling failure modes. FPF/LPF surfaces for general 3D stress states can be obtained using only the material properties extracted from the unidirectional (UD) material, and can predict membrane FPF or LPF of any laminate independently of lay-up, while considering the effect of out-of-plane stresses. The predictions of the LPF envelopes and surfaces are compared with experimental data on multidirectional laminates from the first and second World-Wide Failure Exercise (WWFE), showing a satisfactory agreement and validating the conservative character of omni-failure envelopes also in the presence of high levels of triaxiality.",Aeronautical Journal,10.1016/j.jos.2021.12.019
Trash to Energy: A Measure for the Energy Potential of Combustible content of Domestic solid waste generated from an industrialized city of Pakistan,"© 2022 Taiwan Institute of Chemical EngineersBackground: The current study was designed to calculate the approximate energy potential of combustible fraction shared in the overall domestic solid waste stream generated from Faisalabad, the 3rd largest city and an industrial hub of Pakistan through ASTM standards. Methods: Characterization of samples were collected during the rainy season from June-August 2020 and January-March 2021 from three discrete socio-economic classes (lower income class [Rs. 15,000 (US $100)], middle-income class [Rs. 50,000 (US $350)] and high-income class [Rs. ≥1,00,000 (US $1,000)]) and segregated into 13 different physical components consisting of organic waste, yard waste, wood, cardboard, textile, plastic, paper, metal, rubber, glass, ceramic, diapers, dust, stone and miscellaneous. Significant Findings: More than 70% of the overall generated solid waste was shared by organic waste in the study area, comprising 64.75% moisture content on average. Among all the physical elements of solid waste, combustible content was estimated at 37% in dry mass with 19.23% of ash content and 80.77% of the volatile organic compound. The results of the study approximate about 27.18 MW of energy generation from the available combustible fraction of 1,155 t of domestic solid waste generated from the city daily which can fulfil the need of almost 5,00,000 houses having an average usage of 500 W electricity on monthly basis. The study concludes the conversion of solid waste into energy is the suitable practice for solid waste generated but needed to make this solution practicable with the help of government officials with the involvement of appropriate private sector which will definitely generate new jobs for unemployed persons. The summary demands appropriate adaptation in current waste disposal practice to convert the combustible fraction of generated waste into energy to combat the shortfall of energy/electricity in the city of industries.",Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers,10.2514/6.2022-0501
Characterizing Carbon Fiber Conductivity for Structural Antenna Applications,"© 1963-2012 IEEE.This study explores the potential applications of carbon fiber composite material for structural antennas. Carbon fiber composite materials provide excellent specific strength and stiffness; however, their electrical properties, such as conductivity, are not well established, especially in the very high-frequency (VHF) range. Knowledge of a material's conductivity is required for electrical performance estimation through simulations. Through combined experimental and simulated analysis of multiple carbon fiber antennas, the effective conductivity for a biaxial weave carbon fiber composite was determined to be between 7000 and 13 000 S/m in the VHF spectrum. Carbon fiber antenna performance is found to be particularly sensitive to the contact between the carbon fibers and the copper feed; however, radiation efficiencies (REs) of carbon fiber composite antennas are found to be within 2%-10% of a geometrically identical copper antenna, and their bandwidths are nearly identical. The electrical performance of carbon fiber composite antennas demonstrates significant promise for structural antenna applications in the VHF range.",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,10.3390/ma15020657
A high-sensitivity optical fiber temperature sensor with composite materials,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.An arc-shaped misaligned structure interferometer based on a single-mode fiber is proposed herein, in which a layer of composite material is coated onto the structure to improve its temperature sensitivity. Experiments show that the sensor has high sensitivity and linearity with respect to temperature, and the response to strain can be ignored. The temperature sensitivity reaches approximately −0.953 nm/°C, which is ∼79.4 times higher than that of the uncoated sensor. Owing to the advantages of a simple preparation method, low cost, and compact structure, this inter-mode interference-based fiber sensor is expected to be an ideal instrument for high-precision temperature sensing fields.",Optical Fiber Technology,10.1007/978-981-16-8599-6_19
Prospective 5-year clinical evaluation of posterior zirconia fixed dental prostheses veneered with milled lithium disilicate (CADon),"© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Objective: Bi-layer zirconia-based posterior fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) have reportedly a high incidence of veneering ceramic fractures. The CADon technique employs zirconia frameworks veneered with milled lithium disilicate glass–ceramic to overcome these shortcomings but long-term clinical studies are missing. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of posterior 3-unit CADOn FDPs over a 5-year period. Materials and Methods: A total of 25 patients, 16 male and 9 female with a mean age of 55.6 years, received a total of 25 posterior three-unit CADOn FDPs. Patients were recalled for baseline and for follow-up visits at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months. Parameters evaluated were fracture, marginal adaptation, marginal discoloration, wear, polish, color match, surface staining, and retention of these restorations as well as secondary caries of the abutment teeth. Results: A total of 21 FDPs evaluated at 60-months revealed a 100% survival rate. All evaluated clinical parameters were satisfactory (alpha or bravo) and there was no statistically significant difference at different time points, except for surface staining, which was also worse at 60 months compared to baseline (p (Formula presented.) 0.001). Conclusions: CADOn three-unit posterior FDPs demonstrate excellent fracture resistance after 5 years of clinical function. All evaluated clinical parameters were satisfactory, except for surface stain, which also increased over time.

The influence of roughness on the resistance to impact of different CAD/CAM dental ceramics,"© 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica. All rights reserved.This study aimed to investigate the effect of surface roughness (polished vs. CAD/CAM milling simulation) on impact strength of five dental ceramics for manufacturing CAD/CAM monolithic restorations. Specimens of five ceramics (FC- feldspathic glass-ceramic; PICN- polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network; ZLS- zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic; LD- lithium disilicate glass-ceramic; YZ- yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal ceramic) to be tested under impact (15×10×2mm3; n= 15) were divided into two groups, according to surface treatment: Polishing (pol) and grinding (gri) as CAD/CAM milling simulation. Impact strength was tested using the Dynstat method. Roughness, topographic, fractographic and finite element analyses were performed. The impact strength data were analyzed by Weibull, and Pearson correlation was used to correlate roughness and impact strength data. The CAD/CAM milling simulation led to significantly (p<0.05) greater roughness (Ra and Rz) and statistically reduced the impact strength for PICN (polPICN= 4.59 to griPICN= 1.09; ±76% decrease), for LD (polLD= 17.69 to griLD= 10.09; ±43% decrease) and for YZ (polYZ= 74.99 to griYZ= 20.67; ±72% decrease) ceramics; and also promoted a more irregular topography with scratches and grooves. Fractographic and FEA analyses depicted the origin of failure at the higher stress concentration side during the impact test, where the pendulum impacted. The CAD/CAM milling simulation significantly decreased the impact strength of the evaluated ceramic materials.",Brazilian Dental Journal,10.3390/met12010164
Functionally-oriented composite layered materials with martensitic transformations,"© 2022 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.The studies carried out show that the task of ensuring the reliability and expanding the functionality of products operating under multifactorial effects (temperature, force, deformation) can be successfully solved by functionally oriented surface composite materials with thermoelastic martensitic transformations (TMT). The authors proposed the technology of layer-by-layer synthesis of functionally-oriented composite layered materials with TMT in argon environment, implemented on patented equipment in a single technological cycle. This technology determines not only the novelty, but also the economic feasibility of technical solutions. We also suggested step-by-step methods of thermal and thermomechanical treatment of composite layered materials with TMT, which contribute to the structure stabilization while decreasing residual stress. On the basis of complex X-ray diffraction and electron microscopic studies, we determined the structural parameters of High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) materials obtained by HVOF with subsequent thermal and thermomechanical treatment and ceramic materials ZrO2-Y2O3-CeO2-Al2O3 stabilized with Al2O3 with subsequent heat treatment. We investigated the microhardness of surface high-entropy and ceramic materials.

Spectroscopic and Surface Crystallization Characterizations of Yttrium-Doped Phosphate Glasses,"© 2022 by the authors.The composition, structure, and thermal behaviors of yttrium-containing phosphate glasses were studied in this work, and the glass-ceramics were prepared via the two-step crystallization method. The XRD and SEM-EDS results show the forming range of the phosphate glass system and the formation of YPO4 (xenotime) due to the addition of excessive Y2O3. The spectroscopic characterization of these glasses presented shifts of the infrared and Raman bands, demonstrating the depolymerization of the glass network and the formation of novel P–O–Y bonds, and the deconvoluted Raman spectra also exhibited the occurrence of the disproportionation reaction in the glass melting process. The content of non-bridging oxygen (NBOs) from the UV–vis spectra first increased and then decreased with increasing Y2O3. The thermal behaviors show that the Y2O3 reduced the crystallization peak temperature and the thermal stability of the glasses. The crystalline behaviors of the phosphate glass matrix were investigated at different crystallization times of 2–10 h, and a transformation of the crystallization mechanism from surface to volume crystallization was found. The yttrium phosphate glass-ceramics crystallized for 10 h exhibited transformation of the main crystalline phases with increasing Y2O3, and the grain-oriented crystalline surface became irregular.",Crystals,10.1007/s10717-022-00418-z

Long-term outcome of primary total hip arthroplasty with cementless bioactive glass ceramic bottom-coated implants and highly cross-linked polyethylene: A minimum 10-year analysis,"© 2022Background: Cementless glass ceramics containing apatite and wollastonite (AW-GC) bottom-coated titanium hip implants were developed; early excellent clinical and radiographic results have been reported previously. This study aimed to investigate the long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes in detail, and the wear rate of HXLPE. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 99 patients (117 hips) between November 2001 and December 2007. The survival rate was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Hip joint function was evaluated using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score. The extent of radiographic signs was determined from the radiographs performed at the last follow-up. Polyethylene wear was measured using Martell's Hip Analysis Suite. We assessed the possible factors affecting the steady-state linear wear rate. Results: The mean follow-up period was 14.8 ± 2.1 (10–18.6) years. The mean JOA score improved to 88.7 ± 9.4 (59–100) at the final follow-up from 47.8 ± 12.5 (17–76) before surgery. The overall survival rate with the end point of all-cause revision and wear-related revision was 99% and 100% respectively. There was no osteolysis or loosening of either the acetabular or femoral component. All hips were classified as having bone ingrowth fixation. The mean steady-state wear rate was 0.008 ± 0.025 mm/year. We found no significant correlation between the wear rate and age, body weight, body mass index, cup inclination and femoral head size. Conclusion: The combination of AW-GC bottom-coated implants and HXLPE showed excellent implant survival and wear resistance for 15 years.",Journal of Orthopaedic Science,10.1088/1361-665X/ac3a97
Building Life-Cycle Enhancement Multifunctionality into Glass Fiber Reinforced Composite Laminates via Hierarchical Assemblies of Aligned Carbon Nanotubes,"© 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.For aerospace vehicles, where weight reduction is important, studies have been performed on composites to include different functionalities besides their primary structural function. Some of these functionalities include energy savings, self-health monitoring, ice protection system, and self-curing sensing capabilities, and have been demonstrated individually in carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites. Nano-engineering techniques enable integrating these functionalities in composite systems to add multifunctionalities with insignificant changes in dimension or weight of the composite system, while ensuring that the mechanical properties such as strength are maintained or enhanced.

"Structure and Crystallization of High-Calcium, CMAS Glass Ceramics Synthesized with a High Content of Slag","© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In this work, more than 70 wt % of ferromanganese slag (containing 40 wt % CaO) was used to synthesize high-calcium, CaO-MgO-Al2 O3-SiO2 (CMAS) glass ceramics. The effect of SiO2 /CaO on the structure, crystallization behavior and microstructure of high-calcium, CMAS, slag glass ceramics was studied by IR, NMR, DSC, XRD and SEM. The results showed that in the high-calcium, CMAS glass ceramics, the main existing forms of silicon–oxygen tetrahedra (Qn) were Q0 and Q1. With the increase in the SiO2 /CaO, Qn changed from Q0 and Q1 (main units) to Q1 (main units) and Q2, and then to Q1 and Q2 (main units). The polymerization degree of Qn changed from low to high, making the glass more stable, which led to the increase in crystallization temperature and the decrease in crystallization kinetic constant (k) and frequency factor (υ). At the same time, the change in the Qn structure resulted in a gradual change to the main crystal, from akermanite to diopside–wollastonite.",Materials,10.1111/jerd.12864

"Luminescence of SiO2-BaF2:Tb3+, Eu3+ Nano-Glass-Ceramics Made from Sol–Gel Method at Low Temperature","© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The synthesis and characterization of multicolor light-emitting nanomaterials based on rare earths (RE3+) are of great importance due to their possible use in optoelectronic devices, such as LEDs or displays. In the present work, oxyfluoride glass-ceramics containing BaF2 nanocrystals co-doped with Tb3+, Eu3+ ions were fabricated from amorphous xerogels at 350◦C. The analysis of the thermal behavior of fabricated xerogels was performed using TG/DSC measurements (thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)). The crystallization of BaF2 phase at the nanoscale was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the changes in silicate sol–gel host were determined by attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy. The luminescent characterization of prepared sol–gel materials was carried out by excitation and emission spectra along with decay analysis from the5D4 level of Tb3+ . As a result, the visible light according to the electronic transitions of Tb3+ (5D4 →7FJ (J = 6–3)) and Eu3+ (5D0 →7FJ (J = 0–4)) was recorded. It was also observed that co-doping with Eu3+ caused the shortening in decay times of the5D4 state from 1.11 ms to 0.88 ms (for xerogels) and from 6.56 ms to 4.06 ms (for glass-ceramics). Thus, based on lifetime values, the Tb3+/Eu3+ energy transfer (ET) efficiencies were estimated to be almost 21% for xerogels and 38% for nano-glass-ceramics. Therefore, such materials could be successfully predisposed for laser technologies, spectral converters, and three-dimensional displays.",Nanomaterials,10.1007/978-981-16-7435-8_2
Large Thermal Expansion LTCC System for Cofiring with Integrated Functional Ceramics Layers,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.We have studied the sintering behavior of CT708 LTCC tapes with large CTE of 10.6 ppm/K. This low-k dielectric LTCC material is a quartz-based glass ceramic composite system with partial crystallization of celsian upon firing. The shrinkage, densification and dielectric properties were ex-amined using different heating rates and a sintering temperature of 900◦ C. The maximum shrinkage rate is at 836◦ C (for a heating rate of 2 K/min) with a sintering density of 95% and a permittivity of ε’ = 5.9 and tan δ = 0.0004 (at 1 GHz). Due to their similar shrinkage and thermal expansion properties, CT708 tapes may be cofired with functional ceramic layers. As an example, we report on cofiring of a multilayer laminate of CT708 and a Sc-substituted hexagonal ferrite for applications as integrated microwave circulator components. This demonstrates the feasibility of cofiring of functional ceramic tapes and tailored LTCC tapes and documents the potential for the realization of complex LTCC multilayer architectures.",Materials,10.1007/978-981-16-7439-6_10
Effect of Fe2 O3 on the Crystallization Behavior of Glass-Ceramics Produced from Secondary Nickel Slag,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In this paper, glass-ceramics were prepared from secondary nickel slag by the melting method. The effects of Fe2 O3 on the crystallization behavior of glass-ceramics were investigated by differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The properties of glass-ceramics such as Vickers hardness, bending strength, and acid and alkali resistance were systematically discussed. The results indicate that the crystallization temperature (Tc) and transition temperature (Tg) of the glass show a trend of decreasing and then increasing with the increase in Fe2 O3 content. The precipitation and refinement of the crystalline phase were promoted significantly when the Fe2 O3 content was lower (≤9.32 wt%), while the crystallinity decreased slightly when the Fe2 O3 content increased to 12.42 wt%. The promotion of crystal precipitation led to the depolymerization of the glass network. When the Fe2 O3 content was 9.32 wt%, the sample exhibited the best crystallization ability, consisting of uniformly distributed anorthite, ferrobustamite and glass phases, while the Vickers hardness and bending strength were 11.42 GPa and 121 MPa, respectively.",Metals,10.1016/j.jmrt.2021.12.131

It was found that the Ni2+-luminescence efficiency increased on account of both an increase in the degree of crystallinity of glass with Al2O3 and an increase in the strength of the crystal field around the Ni2+ ions on account of Al3+ incorporation into the structure of the precipitated nanocrystals.",Glass and Ceramics (English translation of Steklo i Keramika),10.3390/ma15010365
Mechanism of hopping conduction in Be–Fe–Al–Te–O semiconducting glasses and glass–ceramics,"© 2022, The Author(s).Electrical properties of beryllium-alumino-tellurite glasses and glass–ceramics doped with iron ions were studied using impedance spectroscopy. The conductivity was measured over a wide frequency range from 10 mHz to 1 MHz and the temperature range from 213 to 473 K. The D.C. conductivity values showed a correlation with the Fe-ion concentration and ratio of iron ions on different valence states in the samples. On the basis of Jonscher universal dielectric response the temperature dependence of conductivity parameters were determined and compared to theoretical models collected by Elliott. In glasses, the conduction process was found to be due to the overlap polaron tunneling while in glass–ceramics the quantum mechanical tunneling between semiconducting crystallites of iron oxides is proposed. The D.C. conductivity was found not to follow Arrhenius relation. The Schnakenberg model was used to analyze the conductivity behavior and the polaron hopping energy and disorder energy were estimated. Additionally, the correlation between alumina dissolution and basicity of the melts was observed.",Journal of Materials Science,10.1007/s00339-021-05204-2
Sodium-Ion Conductivity and Humidity-Sensing Properties of Na2O-MoO3-P2O5 Glass-Ceramics,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A series of glass-ceramics were prepared by heat-treatments of 40Na2O-30MoO3-30P2O5 (in mol%) glass in a temperature range from 380 (Tg) to 490 °C (Tc) and for 1–24 h. The prepared glass-ceramics contain from 2 to 25 wt.% of crystalline NaMoO2PO4. The sodium-ion conductivity in these materials decreases up to one order of magnitude with an increase in the degree of crystallization due to the immobilization of sodium ions in crystalline NaMoO2PO4. The transport of sodium ions in these materials occurs primarily through the dominant continuous glassy phase, and it is weakly affected by the sporadically distributed crystalline grains. However, the prepared glass-ceramics exhibit high proton conductivity in a humid atmosphere and remarkable humidity-sens-ing properties; this could be related to crystalline NaMoO2PO4, which provides sites for water ad-sorption. The glass-ceramic prepared at 450 °C for 24 h shows the best humidity-sensing performance among all samples, showing an increase in proton conductivity for more than seven orders of magnitude with the increase in relative humidity from 0% to 95%. Under a highly humid atmosphere (95% relative humidity and 25 °C), the proton conductivity of this glass-ceramic reaches 5.2 × 10−3 (Ω cm)−1. Moreover, the electrical response of these materials on the change in the relative humidity is linear and reversible in the entire range of the relative humidity, which indicates that they are novel promising candidates for application as humidity sensors.",Nanomaterials,10.1007/978-3-030-88166-5_180
Effects of Water Saturation and Low Temperature Coupling on the Mechanical Behavior of Carbon and E-Glass Epoxy Laminates,"© 2022, The Society for Experimental Mechanics.Advanced composite materials exhibit many desirable characteristics which make them viable candidates for utilization in harsh marine environments. An experimental investigation has been conducted to quantify the effects of coupled water saturation and low temperatures on the mechanical and dynamic behavior of E-glass and carbon epoxy laminates. The relative performance of the materials as a function of water saturation and decreasing temperature was characterized through detailed experiments, specifically in-plane (tensile/compressive) and shear material properties, static and dynamic Mode-I fracture, and impact/flexure after impact strength. The temperature range considered in the study corresponds to a range from room temperature (20 °C) down to Arctic seawater and extreme ocean depth conditions (−2 °C). The materials utilized in the study, carbon/epoxy and E-glass/epoxy, are chosen due to their primary interest to the marine and undersea vehicle communities.

Ultrasonic guided wave-based debond identification in a GFRP plate with L-stiffener,"© 2021 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.This paper presents a robust assessment of debond in a glass fibre-reinforced polymer composite structure with L-stiffener attachment. Towards this, the ultrasonic guided wave (GW) propagation based laboratory experiments have been carried out on a stiffened composite panel with piezoelectric transducers for the excitation of GWs and a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer for sensing the GW propagation. To study the changes caused by the stiffener and debond a signal processing based multi-point analysis has been carried out. The proposed methodology consists of two steps. Step 1 using the full wavefield root mean square energy map-based approach to check the presence of debond. Step 2 using point-wise measurements to study debond localization and size estimation using a baseline free signal coefficient difference algorithm (SCDA). The proposed processing approaches are applied for an in-depth analysis of the experimental signals that provide information about the interaction of GWs with stiffener and debond. The mentioned approaches take advantage of the asymmetry caused by the damage. For the applied SCDA methodology there is no need for full-wavefield measurements, healthy case measurements, as only a few measurement points can be enough for the assessment of stiffener debond in such structures.",Smart Materials and Structures,10.1007/978-3-030-88166-5_110

The required hardware comes in different biomaterials which each have advantages and disadvantages based on their material and structural properties. 3D printing has been proposed as a method for accurate preoperative planning, patient and trainee education, intraoperative guidance systems, and intraoperative implants.",Springer Series in Biomaterials Science and Engineering,10.1007/s11837-021-04992-5
An investigation into the morphology and crystallization process of lithium borate glass containing vanadium oxide,"© 2021 The Author(s)A series of lithium borate glasses with V2O5 were successfully prepared by melt annealing. The glass-ceramics were made by heating the glass to the glass transition temperature (Tg), then heating it to the crystallization temperature (Tc), converting it from a vitreous state to a crystalline state. This study found a link between the glass transition (Tg) and V2O5 ratio in the host glass, with Tg rising from 345 °C for base glass to 419 °C for glass containing 2% V2O5. The glass stability of the base sample was higher than that of the V2O5 samples. XRD analysis revealed the main crystalline phase in the derived glass-ceramics to be Li2B4O7 tetragonal, with crystalline traces of Li2B2O4.16H2O phase. Similarly, crystallite growth on plane (112) decreased from 253 Å (the base) to 239 Å (2% V2O5). Vitreous structure was existed in the glass samples, while spherical particles were found in the derived glass-ceramic materials. The spherical particles began to take on large geometric shapes as the V2O5 content increased from 1% to 2%. All glass-ceramic samples have traces of vitreous material. Glass and glass-ceramics with structural units of BO3, BO4, boroxol rings, and B–O–B linkages were also presented. The phonon-energy (Eph) and optical transition (Eg) showed a strong correlation with V2O5 content. As V2O5 increased between the conduction and valence bands, Eph increased from 99 to 232 meV and Eg decreased from 3.164 to 2.250 eV.",Journal of Materials Research and Technology,10.1016/j.optmat.2021.111828
What Is the Most Effective Technique for Bonding Brackets on Ceramic—A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Background: There has been an increase in demand for orthodontic treatment within the adult population, who likely receive restorative treatments using ceramic structures. The current state of the art regarding the most effective method to achieve an appropriate bond strength of brackets on ceramic surfaces isn’t consensual. This systematic review aims to compare the available surface treatments to ceramics and determine the one that allows to obtain the best bond strength. Methods: This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines and the PICO methodology was used, with the question “What is the most effective technique for bonding brackets on ceramic crowns or veneers?”. The research was carried out in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. In vitro and ex vivo studies were included. The methodological quality was evaluated using the guidelines for reporting of preclinical studies on dental materials by Faggion Jr. Results: A total of 655 articles searched in various databases were initially scrutinized. Sevety one articles were chosen for quality analysis. The risk of bias was considered medium to high in most studies. The use of hydrofluoric acid (HF), silane and laser afforded the overall best results. HF and HF plus laser achieved significantly highest bond strength scores in felsdphatic porcelain, while laser was the best treatment in lithium disilicate ceramics. Conclusions: The most effective technique for bonding brackets on ceramic is dependent on the type of ceramic.",Bioengineering,10.1016/j.ast.2021.107257
Effect of Corrosive Media on the Chemical and Mechanical Resistance of IPS e.max® CAD Based Li2 Si2 O5 Glass-Ceramics,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The influence of 4% acetic acid (pH~2.4) and an alkaline solution of NaOH (pH~10) on the corrosion resistance and micromechanical properties of disilicate crystals containing glass-ceramics (LS2-GC’s) is studied. Partially crystallized lithium metasilicate crystal containing glass-ceramics (LS-GC’s) are annealed to fully LS2-GC’s using a one stage and a two-stage heating to induce nucleation. Materials with various chemical and wear resistance are prepared. The content of the crystalline phase in the material annealed in the two-stage process A is 60.0% and increases to 72.2% for the material heated in the one-stage process B. The main elements leached in the acidic medium are lithium and phosphorus, while lithium, silicon, and phosphorus leached into the alkaline environment. Material B exhibits better chemical resistance to the corrosive influence of 4% acetic acid under quasi-dynamic conditions. In the alkaline corrosion medium, silicon is leached from material A faster compared to the material B. After prolonged exposure to acidic or basic environments, both materials show evidence of surface structural changes. A decrease of the sliding wear resistance is observed after corrosion in the acidic environment under dynamic conditions. In both materials, the wear rate increases after corrosion.",Materials,10.1016/j.engfracmech.2021.108139
"Characterization, bioactivity, and antimicrobial activity of CuO-containing devitrite glass–ceramic","© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.Bioactive glass–ceramic was prepared from devitrite (Na2Ca3Si6O16) glass. Limestone and sodium carbonate were used as starting materials. The prepared materials were characterized by different techniques (DTA-Thin film XRD- FTIR- SEM/EDX). Moreover, in vitro degradation studies, bioactivity in simulated body fluid (SBF), and antimicrobial effects against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were also investigated. Material characterization reveals that the sintering process of the glasses displayed the crystallization of both pseudowollastonite and devitrite. Moreover, the photomicrographs showed interlocked rods and some accumulated irregular leaf-like crystals at nanometer thickness. The bioactivity results revealed that all samples could form a hydroxyapatite layer either after 2 or 4 weeks in SBF. Furthermore, the microstructure indicated accumulated round clusters containing nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite. Likewise, the increase in densities supports the formation of hydroxyapatite on the sample surfaces after soaking in SBF. The antibacterial results illustrated that all samples had antibacterial properties against the tested bacteria. However, the sample containing more copper had a significantly higher antibacterial effect than the other two samples.",Applied Physics A: Materials Science and Processing,10.17341/gazimmfd.893761
Carbon Nanotubes Strengthened Interphase in Textile Reinforced Mortar (TRM) Composites,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Performance of inorganic matrix composite materials for structural purposes is strongly dependent on the matrix-to-fabric interphase bond strength. Consequently, owing to lack of congruence between the fabric and the matrix, design performance parameters are strongly penalised. Besides, yarn inner filaments (the core) easily slide over outer filaments (the sleeve) in the so-called telescopic failure. Broad experimental evidence supports the adoption of epoxy coatings to improve matrix-to-fabric strength and prevent telescopic failure, although the presence of the organic phase partially impairs the remarkable advantages associated to the inorganic matrix, such as thermal stability and water vapour permeability. Silica coatings appear as a promising alternative to traditional epoxy, by inducing localised pozzolanic reactivity, firmly linking synthetic fibres and hydraulic lime through the formation of highly cementing products at the interphase. In this work, the effect of a dispersion of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in a silica nano-coating is assessed in uni-axial traction tests. The silica coating is prepared through sol-gel deposition in which carbon nanotubes are dispersed. The overall amount of carbon nanotubes in the silica sol is fixed at 0.5% wt. Silica-coated AR-glass and carbon fabric composite specimens, embedded in a commercially-available lime mortar matrix, are tested and compared. Carbon nanotubes provide a remarkable enhancement in both ultimate strength and elongation for AR-glass TRM, yielding an impressive two-fold increase in terms of strength. Differently, coated carbon fabrics composites show an increase up to 31% in terms of ductility, in view of an unexpected strength loss.",Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,10.1007/978-3-030-79983-0_29
Design Procedure for the FRCC Strengthening of Beam-Column Joints,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Existing reinforced concrete buildings were mainly designed with old code provisions. This resulted in lack of proper seismic details and, in turn, the occurrence of premature brittle failures as frequently observed in the aftermath of recent seismic events. The shear failure of the joint panel is one of the main reason limiting the seismic performance of existing structural systems. Several retrofit solutions were proposed in the recent years to improve the joint panel shear strengthening and, nowadays, composite materials are frequently used in the common design practice. The widespread use of fibre-reinforced cement composites (FRCC) and high-performance fibre-reinforced cementitious composites (HPFRCC) opened new frontiers in the design of the shear capacity of RC members. The high tensile strength, toughness, and tolerance for damage make these materials attractive for the use in earthquake-resistant structures, with emphasis on RC members with shear-dominated response. Although several experimental tests demonstrated the effectives of these materials in the seismic retrofit of existing beam-column joint a proper design formulation is still lacking. This research paper presents a novel procedure for the design of the exterior FRCC jacketing of poorly detailed on beam-column joints. A mechanical model based on the principal tensile stress approach is proposed. The model is later validated against a comprehensive database of experimental tests at global and local level. The proposed procedure allows the designers to calculate the thickness of the FRCC jacketing to avoid the joint panel shear failure and promoting a more ductile failure mode.",Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,10.1080/09506608.2021.1994108
Cyclic Tests on Masonry Vaults Strengthened Through Composite Reinforced Mortar: The Role of the Connection with the Abutments,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Experimental cyclic tests on full-scale, isolated vaults, carrying their self-weight and subjected to a uniformly distributed transversal load were performed so to investigate on the effectiveness of the Composite Reinforced Mortar strengthening technique. It is based on the application, at the vault extrados or intrados, of a 30 mm thick mortar coating with Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer meshes embedded. In the tests, the reinforced layer was connected to the masonry abutments through steel bars and GFRP elements. The actual performances of these connections in preventing slides and uplifts at the spring sections, which reduce the strengthening effectiveness, are analyzed in the paper. The comparisons of the results with previous experimental tests (without connection at the abutments) and numerical simulations, evidence a good effectiveness of the strengthening intervention, with significant benefits in both resistance and displacement capacities, and permit to assess the actual effectiveness of the tested connection strategy.",Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,10.1002/adma.202107346
Investigation on Utilization of Sodium Silicate Synthesized from Agricultural Waste as a Dispersant in Clay-Based Slip for Ceramic Production,"© 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Thailand is the world’s largest rice exporter, tend to continuous increasing the agricultural waste. Burning, to eliminate an agricultural waste, pollutes the air with CO and CO2 emissions which is considered by many in the science community to be a cause of global warming. However, the calcined agricultural waste with the optimum temperature, results in a rich source of active-SiO2. Active-SiO2 was reacted with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form sodium silicate (Na2SiO3), called as waterglass or soluble glass. Therefore, sodium silicate is often used as a deflocculant in clay-based ceramic slip production to reduce viscosity instead of adding large amounts of water. In this work, rice straw and rice husk are an agricultural waste and used as a starting material. Before used, the reaction temperature of agricultural waste is checked by using DTA-TGA technique. The waste was first calcined at 600 °C for 2 h in air to remove organic matter and produce high purity of active-SiO2. This was then added to NaOH as the starting material for Na2SiO3 synthesis. Then used synthesized Na2SiO3 as a dispersant in clay-based ceramic slip. The phase, viscosity, porosity, and particle arrangement were tested and compared with commercial grade of Na2SiO3. Sodium silicate from agricultural waste exhibited high-performance deflocculant behavior, with reduced viscosity and water demand of clay minerals. Card pack particle arrangement resulted in increased density and low porosity, and directly endowed the ceramic products with high strength. For reducing waste and environmental impact, the result suggested that sodium silicate produced from agricultural waste, can be utilized as a promising and alternative natural deflocculant to clay-based ceramic slip in the ceramic manufacturing process to decrease production costs.",Integrated Ferroelectrics,10.1016/j.addma.2021.102481
"Crystallization Kinetics, Structure and Phase Formation of Magnetic Nanocrystals in Bioactive Glass Systems","© 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.We have investigated the magnetic properties of nanostructured magnetic crystals embedded in strontium hexaferrite-bioglass (SF-45S5). The crystallization kinetics, structure and phase formation of nanoparticles were also studied. The incorporation technique was employed to synthesize 45S5 glass. The crystallization rate constant (n) of the magnetic bioactive glass was found to be approximately 3. This suggests that bulk crystallization is occurs by a three-dimensional crystal growth. The presence of SrFe12O19, CaP4O11, Na2Ca3Si6O16 and Fe2O3 in all of the quenched glass samples was evidenced by X-ray diffraction results. Micrographs of the crystallized base glass SF-45S5 system, obtained from scanning electron microscopy, showed the presence of granular-like crystals in the glass ceramics.

"Waste-to-reuse foam glasses produced from soda-lime-silicate glass, cathode ray tube glass, and aluminium dross","© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by/ 4.0/).Aluminium dross is a hazardous industrial waste generated during aluminium production. It contains metallic oxides of aluminium and magnesium, other phases (aluminum nitride), and residues of fluxes and salts from the melting process of aluminium. Discarding this by-product is considered an environmental and economic challenge due to the high reactivity of dross with water or even air humidity. After removing the hazardous components from the as-received dross, one of the optional approaches is to incorporate the treated dross into construction materials. Dross is applied in several types of research as a secondary raw material source for alumina, clinker, cement or glass-ceramic production, but only a few papers focus on the usage of dross as a foaming agent for foams. Even fewer research are reported where dross was applied as a basic component of foam glasses. In this work, foam glasses were produced completely from waste materials: Aluminium dross, container (SLS) glass, and cathode ray tube (CRT) glass. The research holds several specificities, i.e., combining two industrial waste materials (CRT glass and dross), and adding an increased amount from the wastes. The physical and mechanical characteristics were examined with a special focus on the effect of the foam glass components on the microstructure, density, thermal conductivity, and compressive strength.",Inorganics,10.1002/pssa.202100494
Material removal predictions in the robot glass polishing process using machine learning,"© 2021, The Author(s).Abstract: Robot polishing is increasingly being used in the production of high-end glass workpieces such as astronomy mirrors, lithography lenses, laser gyroscopes or high-precision coordinate measuring machines. The quality of optical components such as lenses or mirrors can be described by shape errors and surface roughness. Whilst the trend towards sub nanometre level surfaces finishes and features progresses, matching both form and finish coherently in complex parts remains a major challenge. With increasing optic sizes, the stability of the polishing process becomes more and more important. If not empirically known, the optical surface must be measured after each polishing step. One approach is to mount sensors on the polishing head in order to measure process-relevant quantities. On the basis of these data, machine learning algorithms can be applied for surface value prediction. Due to the modification of the polishing head by the installation of sensors and the resulting process influences, the first machine learning model could only make removal predictions with insufficient accuracy. The aim of this work is to show a polishing head optimised for the sensors, which is coupled with a machine learning model in order to predict the material removal and failure of the polishing head during robot polishing. The artificial neural network is developed in the Python programming language using the Keras deep learning library. It starts with a simple network architecture and common training parameters. The model will then be optimised step-by-step using different methods and optimised in different steps. The data collected by a design of experiments with the sensor-integrated glass polishing head are used to train the machine learning model and to validate the results. The neural network achieves a prediction accuracy of the material removal of 99.22%. Article highlights: First machine learning model application for robot polishing of optical glass ceramicsThe polishing process is influenced by a large number of different process parameters. Machine learning can be used to adjust any process parameter and predict the change in material removal with a certain probability. For a trained model,empirical experiments are no longer necessaryEquipping a polishing head with sensors, which provides the possibility for 100% control.",SN Applied Sciences,10.1002/lpor.202100346

Optical properties of Tb3+/Yb3+ co-doped silica-hafnia glass and glass-ceramic thin film,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In this paper, optical properties of Tb3+/Yb3+ co-doped 70SiO2 - 30HfO2 glass and glass-ceramic thin films prepared by dip coating on Si O2 substrate are investigated using transmittance measurements. Such systems are usually used for down-converting the high-frequency sunlight in order to tune the solar spectrum into the bandgap of the semi-conductor based photovoltaic system. The interference modulated transmission spectra τ(λ) of 70SiO2 - 30HfO2- x Tb3+−y Yb3+ (with molar ratio x/y = 1.8/0, 1.8/7.2, 3/12) at normal incidence were recorded in the spectral wavelength region from 250 nm up to 2500 nm. The corresponding optical constants and thicknesses were deduced by analyzing the transmittance spectra using the straightforward method proposed by Swanepoel. The dispersion of the real part of the refractive index and the absorption were then deduced. The results show thatthe increase in the concentration of rare earth ions leads to a slight increase in the refractive index, this is also observed in thickness variation.Furthermore, the energy bandgap has been determined from the absorption coefficient values using the direct transition model proposed by Tauc. The corresponding value is around 3 eV with a slightly higher bandgap for glass films as compared to glass-ceramic films.",Optical Materials,10.1007/s11581-021-04320-6
Agglomerated impact of CNT vs. GNP nanofillers on hybridization of polymer matrix for vibration of coupled hemispherical-conical-conical shells,"© 2021 Elsevier Masson SASThis paper is dedicated to study the vibrational behavior of Coupled Hemispherical-Conical-Conical Shells (CHCCS) structures made composite materials reinforced with nanofillers. One of the most important issue in nanocomposites is the agglomeration effect of nanofillers in hybridization procedure. In this study, two well-known nanofillers including Carbon Nano Tubes (CNTs) and Graphene Nano Platelets (GNPs) are used for reinforcement of polymer matrix. In addition, the distribution of agglomerated nanofillers throughout the thickness of the structures is assumed to be uniform and functional. Therefore, three patterns of distribution including X, O and V are employed. To study these topics, first, the authors obtain the displacement fields of CHCCS using Donnell's shell theory. In this formulation, the First Order Shear Deformation Theory (FOSDT) is utilized to consider the shear deformation effect. Second, the Hamilton's principle is used for achieving the governing equations of motion associated with the CHCCS structure. Afterwards, an efficient and robust approximation numerical solution method, namely Generalized Differential Quadrature (GDQ) method, is employed to discretize the governing system of differential equations, apply boundary and connective conditions related to the CHCCS. Since there is no applicable benchmark for this analysis, the authors prove their proposed formulation by comparing the obtained results with the outputs of FEM program for some specific problems. Furthermore, several new and complex problems are designed and solved to investigate the effect of various factors such as geometrical characteristics, weight proportions, and distribution patterns of CNTs and GNPs on the vibration parameter of CHCCS. It is worth mentioning that the effect of agglomeration parameters associated with these nanofillers on the vibrational behavior of CHCCS structures is also studied numerically.",Aerospace Science and Technology,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.121217
A deep learning method for damage prognostics of fiber-reinforced composite laminates using acoustic emission,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdDamage prognostics of fiber-reinforced composites using advanced nondestructive test techniques is of great significance due to their complicated damage mechanisms. This paper employs the acoustic emission (AE) technique to monitor the performance degradation process and to estimate the residual load-bearing abilities of glass fiber/epoxy composite laminates with the damage evolution of various failure modes. Based on the prior knowledge of AE signals, a prognostic model by combining the feature evaluation algorithms and deep learning methods is developed. First, the model conducts the feature evaluation on twenty-four AE features and filters out the degradation-insensitive features from the multiple perspectives of different AE sensors. Second, a convolutional neural network model is built and trained on five informative features for the degradation estimation. The estimation accuracy is validated to be generally high that depends on the degradation stage. Third, the effect of the number of AE signals in an input sequence on the estimation is further investigated. Results show that such a prognostic model provides a feasible path to quantify the degradation process and damage tolerance of composite materials.",Engineering Fracture Mechanics,10.1111/ijac.13921
Flash sintering effect on fly ash microstructure Flas sinterleme yönteminin uçucu kül mikroyapisina etkisi,"© 2022 Gazi Universitesi Muhendislik-Mimarlik. All rights reserved.Purpose: In this study, densification of fly ash, (FA, industrial waste glass ceramic material) powder is carried out by electric field assisted flash sintering method. Theory and Methods: FA obtained from Tunçbilek Thermal Power Plant (Kütahya, Turkey). During the flash sintering experiment, 450 V/mm electric field is applied on sample with 0.85 amp current cutoff value. Results: According to XRD analysis, glassy phase, quartz, hematite, magnetite, magnesioferrite and mullite structures are in the structure. Based on the results of chemical analysis (XRF), reported in the literature, the sintering of ceramic materials formed by SiO2, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 individually or all together occurs at temperatures of 1500 °C and above. By electric field assisted flash sintering technique, the sintering temperature is decreased from 1500 to 1137°C along with a decrement in sintering time from 3 hours to 70 seconds. The sintering process with this method was performed at a lower temperature and in a shorter time than traditional sintering methods. With the SEM micrographs, it has been proven that fly ash flash sintering processes have a more dense structure compared to the conventional sintering. Conclusion: Flash sintering is accomplished in 70 sec at ≈ 1137°C. By electric field assisted flash sintering technique, the sintering temperature is decreased from 1500 to 1137°C along with a decrement in sintering time from 3 hours to 70 seconds.

Modeling of High-Speed Interaction of Composite Barrier and Steel Striker,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Numerous studies, carried out in the field of reinforcement of building constructions with composite materials using carbon composites, necessitate the creation of adequate mathematical models and methods of strength analysis of such structures under the action of static and dynamic loads. Currently, there are specification documents and recommendations, regulating the procedure for strengthening load-bearing structures with external reinforcement systems under the action of static loads. The development of mathematical models and methods for assessing the dynamic strength of composite materials under the action of high-intensity loads of impact and explosion of civil defence shelters and special facilities is an urgent task. The presented work deals with the results of theoretical studies of deformation, destruction and open penetration of single-layer and combined multilayer barriers at high-speed impact of ball-shaped strikers. The authors have proposed a mathematical model, describing within the framework of flow mechanics the processes of deformation and destruction of composite structures of concrete slabs, reinforced by an external reinforcement system under shock-wave loading conditions. In the range of meeting speeds of 1000–1500 m/s, the influence of the front and rear layers of reinforcement with carbon unidirectional fabric on the epoxide target from fine concrete on the process of penetration with a steel indenter at the approach angle of 90˚ has been investigated.",Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.09.047

Ultrafast Synthesis of I-Rich Lithium Argyrodite Glass–Ceramic Electrolyte with High Ionic Conductivity,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHLithium argyrodites are one of the most promising sulfide electrolytes due to their high ionic conductivity and ductile feature. Among them, Li6PS5I (LPSI) exhibits better stability against Li metal but a rather low ionic conductivity (only ≈10−6 S cm−1) because of the absence of S2−/I− disorder. Herein, argyrodite Li6−xPS5−xI1+x glass–ceramic electrolytes with high iodine content are synthesized using ultimate-energy mechanical alloying method. S2−/I− disorder is successfully introduced into the system by doping LiI during this one-pot process. Determined by 6Li magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the introduction of iodine promotes Li+ inter-cage jumps, leading to an enhanced long-range Li+ conducting. The Li5.6PS4.6I1.4 glass–ceramic electrolyte (LPSI1.4-gc) possesses high ionic conductivity (2.04 mS cm−1) and excellent stability against Li metal. The Li symmetric cell with the LPSI1.4-gc electrolyte demonstrates ultralong cycling stability over 3200 h at 0.2 mA cm−2. LiCoO2/Li6PS5Cl/Li all-solid-state battery applying LPSI1.4-gc as the anode interlayer also presents prominent cycling and rate performance.

Additive manufacturing of lithium aluminosilicate glass-ceramic/metal 3D electronic components via multiple material laser powder bed fusion,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Multiple material additive manufacturing technology with the capability to integrate glass-ceramic and metallic materials is essential to the development of high-performance functional components for high temperature applications. Here we show the feasibility and characteristics of additively manufactured glass-ceramic/metal 3D electronic components via single-process multiple material laser powder bed fusion (MMLPBF). Copper (II) oxide (CuO) powder is mixed with α-spodumene (lithium aluminosilicate, Li2O·Al2O3·4SiO2) glass-ceramic powder to improve the laser absorbance, reduce the melting point of glass-ceramic to match that of copper and to improve bonding between copper and the glass-ceramic. Up to 92% relative density of the glass-ceramic is realized. The monoclinic crystal α-spodumene has been transformed to tetragonal crystal β-spodumene after laser melting. Sodium chloride (NaCl) and graphite mixed powder is printed as the substrate for the glass-ceramic component for its rapid removal. Embedded conductive copper wires and plates as the main conductive structures are successfully built within the glass-ceramic from powder feedstocks. The electrical resistivity of the printed copper structures is examined.

Preparation and characterization of SiC-ZAC composite material for immobilizing the simulated radioactive graphite,"© 2021For the safe treatment and disposal of radioactive graphite, SiC-ZAC (ZAC: ZnO-Al2O3-CaO glass-ceramic) composite materials were designed, in which ZAC is used as a sintering additive. The performance of ZAC was firstly studied by ASTM C1285 leaching test to obtain a formula composition with high chemical stability. Then, using the optimized formula of ZAC, the SiC-ZAC composites were prepared by vacuum calcination at 1350 °C–1410 °C for the immobilizing of simulated radioactive graphite, and the structure and compositions of SiC-ZAC composites were studied by XRD, SEM, EDS. The material Gibbs free energy function method was used to calculate the thermodynamics of SiC-ZAC composites to investigate the reaction ways among Si, C and ZAC. The results show the Z30 (30 wt% ZnO, 44.91 wt% Al2O3, 25.09 wt% CaO) glass-ceramic is the applicable formula composition due to its high chemical stability, in which the normalized elemental mass loss of Zn, Al, Ca are 10−6g/m2-10−5 g/m2, 10−1 g/m2, 10−1 g/m2 respectively. Calcined at 1350 °C for 2 h, the B-Z30(0)-1(70.05 wt% Si, 29.95 wt% C) sample can be obtained with the phase compositions of β-SiC, α-SiC and a small amount of residual graphite. Moreover, the formations of Ca2Al2SiO7 and CaAl4O7 crystalline phase had a negative effect on the immobilization of simulated radioactive graphite in SiC-ZAC composites.",Progress in Nuclear Energy,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.09.195
Energy Transfer and Quenching in Sol–Gel-Derived Silica Glass Green Phosphors Doped with Tb3+ and Ce3+ Ions: Distinct Difference between P- and Al-Codoped Glasses,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe (Tb,Ce)−P-codoped silica glasses containing (Tb,Ce)PO4 nanocrystals (silica−(Tb,Ce)PO4 glass-ceramics) and (Tb,Ce)−Al-codoped silica glasses are prepared by a cosolvent-free sol−gel method. They emit bright green photoluminescence (PL) attributed to the 5D4 → 7Fj (j = 1 − 6) transition of Tb3+ ions under excitation at 290 nm into the 4f−5d transition of Ce3+ ions. The (Tb,Ce)−P-codoped silica glass prepared at the P to rare-earth (RE) molar ratio of 2 exhibits the internal and external PL quantum efficiencies of ≈0.99 and ≈0.95, respectively, and realizes negligible concentration quenching in (Tb,Ce)PO4 nanocrystals with photoactive RE concentration as high as ≈1.5 × 1022 cm−3. Rapid energy migration over Tb3+ ions in these nanocrystals is confirmed by almost complete PL quenching by the intentional dilute doping of quenching centers (Nd3+ ions). The PL quantum efficiencies are much lower in the (Tb,Ce)−Al-codoped silica glasses, in which RE ions are dispersed. However, the similar Nd3+ doping only mildly decreases the PL quantum efficiency of this type of glass. These phenomena are consistently explained by the different degree of dispersion of RE ions in the (Tb,Ce)−P- and (Tb,Ce)−Al-codoped silica glasses.",Physica Status Solidi (A) Applications and Materials Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151375
NaAlSiO4: Eu2+ Glass Ceramics: Self-Reduced In Situ Growth and High-Power LED/LD Lighting,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHCurrently, exploiting luminescent materials with super thermal stability and high luminous efficiency are highly urgent to meet the needs of fast developing high-power solid-state lighting (SSL). Glass ceramic (GC) bulk material is an optimal medium with rigid glass network structure and controllable glass crystallization. Herein, an in situ glass crystallization strategy combined with self-reduced Eu2+ is developed to fabricate Eu2+ doped NaAlSiO4 (NASO) GC composites in air. Structural and spectroscopic characterizations verify that the in situ precipitated NASO nanocrystals with high crystallization density can accommodate Eu2+ emitting centers in the same glass region, which facilitates the separation of Eu2+ dopants from glass into crystalline lattice without the requirement of long-distance ionic diffusion and provides strong crystal-field environment for Eu2+ 5d-4f transition. Particularly, the present composites can produce intense greenish-yellow emission with apparent photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of ≈70%, intrinsic PLQY of ≈100%, superior thermal stability with 90% PL remained at 150 °C and excellent water-resistance. Employing NSAO: Eu2+ GC as a color converter, the performance of constructed light-emitting diode (LED)/laser diode (LD) lighting devices is extraordinary and stable during long-term working. These findings would expand the application of GC composites and open up new avenues for exploration of novel GC materials and glass crystallization strategies.",Laser and Photonics Reviews,10.1111/ijag.16538
Metal-organic framework-derived graphene porous carbon matrix based lithium hydroxide chemical heat storage composite materials for residential heating,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.As a promising candidate for converting renewables into chemical energy, lithium hydroxide based chemical heat storage (CHS) materials have gained great investigate enthusiasm by virtue of their outstanding storage capacity and long storage lifespan. But salt hydrates still cannot get rid of the inherent shortcomings of poor thermal conductivity, sintering, low hydration rate, and serious heat storage density degradation, Hence, it is highly desirable to create a salt hydrate CHS material that can achieve improved thermal conductivity, heat storage capacity and water storage content while maintaining good cycle stability for efficient utilization of low grade heat and residential heating. Here, we develop a lithium hydroxide composite CHS material with zeolitic imidazolate framework produced graphene-based (ZIF-8/GO) porous carbon templates as the host porous carbon matrix (ZHPCM). This Li/ZHPCM composite has huge storage strength (Max. 1483.8 kJ kg−1), low reaction activation energy and high hydration capacity attribute to the adequate specific surface area and massively porous of ZHPCM, which not only boosts the spreading of lithium hydroxide, but also assuages the sintering of lithium hydroxide, thus increasing the conversion rate of LiOH to LiOH·H2O, and ultimately lead to an improvement in the storage strength. Moreover, compared to lithium hydroxide, this Li/ZHPCM composite shows remarkable cycle property for 15 times of hydration conversion without conspicuous weakened and good thermal conductivity. Besides, the calculated energy barrier that Li/ZHPCM(800)-50 (35.7 kJ mol−1) needs to overcome is also significantly lower than that of lithium hydroxide (50.7 kJ mol−1), which not only implies that the resistance to the reaction of Li/ZHPCM(800)-50 is smaller, but also further proves the important role of ZHPCM(800) in improving the performance of lithium hydroxide. This novel LiOH composite CHS material may paves a new way for residential heating and the further application of ZHPCM in the future.",Energy and Buildings,10.1111/jace.18106
Improved Na+ ion storage capacity of Na2O-Bi2O3 glass anode network: effect of TiO2 nanocrystals,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.This investigation highlights the influence of nanosized amorphous intermediate domains such as Na3Bi and Na2Ti on the electrochemical characteristics of the new Na2O-Bi2O3 glass anode network mixed with TiO2 nanocrystals. Amorphous domains (h-Na3Bi and h-Na2Ti) are indexed with hexagonal structures precipitated during the charging and discharging process, which might improve the high electrochemical performance of the glass anode network to a greater extent. The first discharge and charge capacities are recorded as 700 and 1060 mAh/g, respectively. Moreover, the Coulombic efficiency achieved is between 66 and 98% as the current rate varies from 0.1 C to 5 C. The value of Rct in the EIS spectra gradually decreases up to 500 cycles, indicating an increase in the electronic conductivity, eventually boosting the ionic conductivity. These results will create a potential interest to design and develop various glass and glass–ceramic anode networks to realize Na-ion technology for large-scale energy storage applications.",Ionics,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.08.377
"Crystallization, structure, and properties of TiO2-ZrO2 co-doped MgO-B2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramics","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.TiO2–ZrO2-codoped MgO–B2O3–Al2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramics were prepared using the traditional melting method. The effects of replacing TiO2 with ZrO2 on the glass stability (GS), crystallization behavior, structures, and properties of the obtained samples were studied. Results showed that the addition of ZrO2 increased the GS, which decreased the crystallization ability of the samples. When the heat treatment temperature was increased from 900 °C to 1000 °C, the mullite and quartz phases first precipitated in the glass matrix, and then converted into cordierite. Because of the low solubility of TiO2 and ZrO2 in this glass system, the rutile and zircon phases will precipitate from the parent glasses. Owing to changes in the composition and structure of the samples, the density and Vickers hardness increased, while the coefficient of thermal expansion of the samples first decreased and then increased when TiO2 was replaced with ZrO2.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.125216
Fabrication of magnetically controllable glass ceramics with completely dense microstructure by hot pressing,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyCompletely dense magnetite-based aluminosilicate glass ceramics with adjustable magnetic properties were successfully synthesized by method of hot pressing. The influences of sintering conditions and magnetite contents on magnetic properties and microstructure of samples were analyzed. It was found that increases in sintering temperature and time could improve the densification degree of samples. However, precipitation of crystalline phases from glass would worsen the densification of samples. The optimum parameters of hot pressing were 950°C for 1 h, under which condition, the glass ceramics containing 10–65 wt.% magnetite showed a fully dense microstructure. As the magnetite content increased from 10 to 65 wt.%, magnetization and area of hysteresis loops of glass ceramics increased, while coercivity showed an opposite trend. However, when the magnetite content increased to 70 wt.%, pores appeared and the degree of densification decreased.",International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology,10.1111/jace.18089
A novel approach for processing CaAlSiON glass-ceramics by spark plasma sintering: Mechanical and electrical properties,"© 2021Lithium containing glassy materials can be used as solid electrolytes or electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries due to their high energy density. Conventional melt-quenched Ca11Al14Si16O49N10 glass powder containing 24 e/o N, doped with Li-ions (1, 3, and 6 wt. %) and sintered by spark plasma sintering technique (SPS) was studied. The benefits of using SPS to produce glass-ceramics are rapid heating rates compared to conventional consolidation techniques and tuning of properties, adjusting the temperature, holding time (closed to Tg temperature), heating rate (solidification), and pressure (densification) profile during the heat treatment using SPS. Pure glass and glass-ceramic were obtained under identical SPS conditions and compared with pristine oxynitride and soda-lime-silicate (float) glasses. XRD and SEM analysis confirmed that increasing the amount of Li increases the crystallinity in the glass matrix. Nano-indentation analysis showed a decreased hardness and reduced elastic modulus values with the addition of Li-ions. The direct current conductivity increases with the addition of Li due to the high mobility of Li-ions. However, the float glass sample doped with 6 wt.% of Li exhibits even higher values of D.C. conductivity, than the analogously doped Ca11Al14Si16O49N10 glass. The magnitude of activation energy (more than 1 eV) is typical for an ion hopping mechanism and the D.C. conduction mechanism is dominated by Li+ hopping.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1111/jace.18094
Combining good mechanical properties and high translucency in yttrium-doped ZrO2-SiO2 nanocrystalline glass-ceramics,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdIt is challenging to develop a material that combines good mechanical properties and high translucency since these properties are generally not coincident in one material. In this study, we prepared ZrO2-SiO2 nanocrystalline glass-ceramics that combines the above two types of properties. Raw powder with 55 mol%, 65 mol%, and 75 mol% ZrO2 and each with 5 mol% yttrium as a dopant was prepared by sol-gel method, followed by spark plasma sintering to obtain dense glass-ceramics. XRD results demonstrated that the glass-ceramics with 65 mol% and 75 mol% ZrO2 were composed of tetragonal-ZrO2, whereas, that with 55 mol% ZrO2 was composed of cubic-ZrO2. The as-sintered glass-ceramics showed black/brown discoloration, but they obtained high translucency after thermal treatment. X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) results in scanning electron transmission microscopy (STEM) mode demonstrated yttrium dopants were predominately distributed in ZrO2 nanocrystallites. The glass-ceramics with 65 mol% ZrO2 had the highest flexural strength, achieving an average value of 673 MPa. The glass-ceramics with different compositions sintered at different temperatures showed fracture toughness values ranging from 5.25 MPa m1/2 to 6.69 MPa m1/2. The strong and translucent ZrO2-SiO2 nanocrystalline glass-ceramics showing great protentional to be used in many fields.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.combustflame.2021.111704
Preparation of monolithic transparent mullite-based glass-ceramics by the sol–gel method,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Monolithic transparent mullite-based glass ceramics were prepared in the system SiO2–Al2O3–B2O3–ZnO–K2O by the sol–gel method. Heat treatment of the resulted monolithic xerogels at 950 °C for 6 h, in air atmosphere resulted dense, homogeneous and transparent glass-ceramics. The activation energy for crystallization, the Avrami constants and the mechanism of crystallization were determined by the Marotta, Augis-Bennet and the modified Kisinger methods, using the differential thermal analysis. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope were also used to determine the crystallinity of the specimens, and the morphology of the precipitated crystalline phase. Also, transparency of the prepared sol and the synthesized glass and glass ceramics were evaluated by UV–vis spectrophotometer. In addition, the volume percent of the precipitated mullite, which was calculated by the internal standard method, was 34%. The transmission of the samples in the range of visible wavelengths was about 79%. According to the results, the Avrami constant for crystallization was 1.24 that means mullite was precipitated in the glassy phase through the surface crystallization mechanism.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,10.1111/jace.18078
Joining dense Si3N4 to porous Si3N4 using a novel glass-ceramic interlayer with precipitated β-LiAlSi2O6/Mg2SiO4,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdIn this work, we developed a new β-LiAlSi2O6/Mg2SiO4 glass-ceramic interlayer to join dense Si3N4 and porous Si3N4 ceramics for high-temperature applications. The microstructure and phases of the joint were investigated using systematic analysis methods and the mechanism for the interfacial bonding was proposed. The double crystalline phases of β-LiAlSi2O6 and Mg2SiO4 precipitated in the joint seam during the joining process, forming a novel glass-ceramic interlayer with high crystallinity. Due to the good wettability of liquid glass on porous Si3N4, a gradient and dense infiltration layer was formed in porous Si3N4 and reinforced it, which improved the mechanical strength of the whole joint. In this case, the shear strength of the joint reached 78 MPa, and it could still maintain 74 MPa up to 850 °C, which fully demonstrated the high-temperature resistance of the joint.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1111/jopr.13414
Effect of BaTiO3 addition on the microwave dielectric properties of MgO–Al2O3–SiO2–TiO2 glass-ceramic,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Barium titanate added MgO–Al2O3–SiO2–TiO2 (MAST) glass ceramic was prepared to obtain a range of dielectric constant 6–8 for microwave application using naturally occurring materials, e.g. talc, alumina and china clay. Firstly, the MAST glass was prepared by the conventional melt quench process. Barium titanate (BaTiO3) powder (5–30 wt%) was added to the obtained MAST glass frit. Ceramic pellets were prepared from homogeneously ground and mixed powders by uniaxial pressing. X-ray diffraction patterns of the sintered pellets (at 1200 °C) show well-defined peaks of cordierite, BaTi5O11 and Ba2Ti9O20, and some anorthite and magnesium titanium oxide phases. The evolution of BaTi5O11 and Ba2Ti9O20 compounds is very much desirable since they possess excellent microwave dielectric properties. Their high dielectric constant and high quality factor would increase the dielectric constant of the compositions without degrading the loss tangent value. The microstructure shows the crystalline and amorphous (glass) phases. The dielectric constant of the prepared glass ceramic samples varies in the range 6.0–8.0 with the tan delta of 10−2 in the X-band, depending on the composition, phase and microstructure of the specimens. The tailored dielectric constant glass ceramic will be useful for microwave device applications.",Materials Chemistry and Physics,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149830
"Structure, up-conversion luminescence and optical temperature sensitive properties of glass ceramics containing Ca5(PO4)3F with double luminescence centers","© 2021In this study, CaF2–ZnO–P2O5–CaO–SiO2 system glass ceramics containing Ca5(PO4)3F nanocrystals were prepared via melting and crystallization, and their structure, up-conversion luminescence properties and energy transfer were investigated. Owing to the different temperature dependences of the three emitting bands at 523, 547 and 659 nm, dual-mode temperature measurement can be realized according to the employed fluorescence intensity ratio technology. Using thermal-coupled energy levels, the maximum relative sensitivity (Sr-max) and absolute sensitivity (Sa-max) were found to be 1.71% K-1 and 0.69% K-1, respectively. Moreover, the maximum relative sensitivity (Sr-max) and absolute sensitivity (Sa-max) were found to be 2.19% K-1 and 0.11% K-1, respectively, based on the nonthermal coupled energy levels. This shows that fluoroapatite transparent glass ceramics have latent application prospects in the optical temperature measurement field.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.gr.2021.07.020
Insight on the structural changes of Glass-Ceramics during nanoindentation derived from Reactive Force-Field-Based molecular dynamic simulations,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Glass-ceramics (GCs) are preferred over glass or ceramics in certain optical applications including those requiring lower porosity than ceramics and higher transition temperatures than glass. However, due to its material heterogeneity, it is difficult to precisely control the microstructure in GCs to meet specific property targets. The chemical mechanism behind the microstructural changes in the two-phase heterogeneity has not yet been clearly elucidated. In this work, the continuous Reactive Force Field molecular dynamics nanoindentation algorithm was developed and used to study the mechanism of structural evolution during nanoindentation. It was found that crystalline phases (CP) had the maximum load at the same indentation depth. The number of point defects of CP was more than glass-crystalline phase (GCP) at the end of loading. However, after total unloading, the opposite was observed with the number of point defects in GCP more than that in CP. The details in GCP bonding indicated that the formation of irreversible supersaturated bonds hindered the healing of defects while promoting the annihilation of pores. The evolution of pores and the typical chemical changes of GCP in the nanoindentation process had also been explored, which proves to be helpful in understanding the behaviors of two-phase heterogeneous materials at the nanoscale.",Applied Surface Science,10.1080/03122417.2021.1955597
Structure and mechanical properties of pyrope (Mg3Al2Si3O12) glass: Effect of high pressure,"© 2021 The American Ceramic Society and Wiley Periodicals LLC.The effect of high pressure and/or high temperature on the structure and mechanical properties of pyrope glass (Mg3Al2Si3O12) was investigated. The local structure of the glass was characterized by the total pair distribution functions derived from synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The short-range order of the Si–O and Al–O pairs was not affected by densificationat 8 Gpa at room temperature. Small irreversible changes were observed in the intermediate range order of the glass, reflected in increasing density from 2.74 to 2.78 g/cm3, hardness from 8.1 to 8.7 GPa, and elastic modulus from 86 to 99 GPa. Thermal treatment of the parent glass at atmospheric pressure induced the crystallization of forsterite and cordierite, while thermal treatment in situ at 8 Gpa induced the crystallization of the cubic phase of pyrope, with density of 3.54 g/cm3, hardness of 16.4 Gpa, and elastic modulus of 195 GPa. This study helps to understand the effect of high pressure on geologically important materials and provides valuable insights for designing and manufacturing new glass-ceramics containing metastable phases with improved properties.",International Journal of Applied Glass Science,10.1111/jace.18057
Examining the phase evolution of lithium disilicate glass-ceramics with lithium tantalate as a secondary phase,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyLithium disilicate glass-ceramics were discovered in the 1950s, and the evolution of the main target phase of these materials is well known. However, the lithium disilicate system is still an area of active research, especially when a secondary phase is introduced since the phase evolution of secondary phases is not currently understood. The present study examines the main target phases, as well as a secondary phase of lithium tantalate, via X-ray diffraction. A large data set is obtained to investigate the evolution of all phases. It is found that the nucleation of the precursor lithium metasilicate phase is coupled to both the nucleation of the primary target phase, lithium disilicate, and the nucleation of lithium tantalate. A reaction equation describing this relationship is proposed.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1080/01694243.2021.1940657
"Chromium in lead metasilicate glass: Solubility, valence, and local environment via multiple spectroscopy","© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.In this article the doping of chromium in a lead metasilicate glass is explored using Raman, UV–Vis, and Cr K-edge XANES spectroscopy. Our results indicate that the Cr ions are predominantly present as CrO42− complexes, with a minor amounts of Cr(III). The solubility of Cr is limited to ∼1 mol % Cr2O3. This boundary was inferred from the intensity changes to the CrO42− stretching vibrations and confirmed by the inability to produce a homogeneous glass containing 2 mol % Cr2O3. The establishment of the solubility limit of Cr in lead glasses is important to design more effective glass compositions depending on the desired application. Finally, this low solubility indicates that Cr2O3 could be used as a potential nucleating agent for lead-silica based glass-ceramics.",Ceramics International,10.1002/jbm.b.34889
Crystallization of the glasses within the SiO2-Li2O-TiO2 system,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Glasses from the ternary system SiO2-Li2O-TiO2 with increasing titania content replacing silica were prepared by melting-annealing technique. Structural FTIR, thermal and differential thermal analysis (DTA) properties of the glasses were measured and evaluated. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope investigations were done to identify the crystalline phases formed together with revealing their morphological features. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) data of glass-ceramic samples are identified to be between 80.83 × 10−7 °C−1 and 120.04 × 10−7 °C−1 (23–500 °C). The increase of the CTE is assumed to be concomitant with the increase of the crystallization of lithium metasilicate (Li2SiO3) phase or quartz (SiO2). Titania is assumed to behave primarily partly as a modifier oxide and at high titania content; it is assumed to act as former (TiO4) groups. X-ray diffraction patterns indicate that the pure lithium silicate glass produces lithium disilicate (LS2) and quartz (SiO2) as crystalline phases and with increasing TiO2, first it acts as a nucleating agent initiating the formation of different crystalline silica phases beside (LS2) then titania is separated at 15 %TiO2 and 30%TiO2 as lithium titanate. The microhardness and densities values are calculated. The studied samples show promising thermal and mechanical properties especially for both CTE and microhardness values, beside their chemical stability which could be applied for commercial uses.",Materials Chemistry and Physics,10.1007/s00784-021-03991-9
Controllable multi-color upconversion in glass ceramics through engineering crystal lattice distortion,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyLanthanide-doped up-conversion (UC) materials with color tunable property show promising application in many fields, such as biological imaging, optical multiplexing, and information security. Although great efforts have been devoted to regulate UC emission color via modifying chemical composition, crystal structure, or external stimuli condition, it is remain a daunting challenge to develop a general strategy that probably suitable for various lanthanide-doped nano-systems. Herein, we verify the cross-relaxation possibility between sensitizer Yb3+ and activator Er3+ as well as Er3+- Er3+ pairs can be well modified by engineering the crystal lattice distortion of matrix, leading to the evident UC emission color variations. Specifically, with incorporating Al3+ or Ca2+ ions into the Yb/Er co-doped BaF2 nanocrystals (NCs) contained glass ceramics (GCs), the contraction of the crystal lattice lead to the change of UC emission color from green to red. On the contrary, the high laser excitation power results in the lattice expansion of the Al3+-doped BaF2:Yb/Er GCs at different Yb3+ concentration as well as Al3+ doped CaF2 GCs, which leads to the greatly increased green-to-red ratio. These multi-color UC GCs show potential application in anti-counterfeiting filed. Our results open up a general avenue for the control of UC emission color via engineering crystal lattice distortion.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1007/s00784-021-03993-7
Treatment of zeolite adsorbed material as a potential nuclear waste glass-ceramic matrix,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyZeolite, as a common adsorption material, should be safely treated after adsorbing different nuclear wastes. In this study, different types of simulated zeolite wastes were successfully immobilized based on the exploring result of suitable experiment conditions. Firstly, sintering temperature was selected based on TG-DSC and phase results, which represented mainly as glassy phase. Then, the holding time was chosen through density and Vickers hardness results. For the sintering of zeolite, the suitable temperature is 1500℃ and the holding time is 1 h. Through the fitting process, FT-IR results demonstrate that the main microstructures compose of sheet silicates. Three types of simulated zeolite wastes can successfully transform into matrix and all the waste contents were uniformly immobilized. Finally, SEM-EDS results prove that the matrix is glass-ceramic which can well immobilize the considered nuclear wastes. This work proposes the idea of treatment of zeolite adsorbed material as a potential nuclear waste glass-ceramic matrix and the suitable conditions were also investigated.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/jopr.13361
Direct observations of ultrasonically generated hot spots in polymer composite energetic materials,"© 2021 The Combustion InstituteThermally dissipated energy from periodic mechanical action can lead to the creation of areas of intense, localized heating in heterogeneous composite materials, called hot spots. Measurements of hot spots have been performed in shock, impact, and friction studies of energetic materials, amongst others. In this work, high-frequency contact loading allows for the controlled development of hot spots near explosive crystals embedded in polymer with temperature gradients suitable for shadowgraph visualization. Heat dissipation initiated the delamination of crystal-binder interfaces, which led to increased heating from interfacial motion and further delamination propagation. A variety of explosives were considered. Low melting point explosives were driven to reaction despite a hypothesized reduction in interfacial friction upon melting, and crystals with controlled surface morphology still experienced damage. Shadowgraphy allows nonintrusive access to internally developing hot spots which, in turn, enables the identification of heat generation mechanisms to inform our understanding of explosive initiation.",Combustion and Flame,10.1111/ijag.15917
Modeling the relaxation and crystallization kinetics of glass without fictive temperature: Toy landscape approach,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyRelaxation and crystallization are key kinetic processes that must be understood to build a comprehensive understanding of the supercooled liquid and glassy states. Traditional approaches have been unable to capture the underlying physics accurately due to assumptions about phenomenological order parameters such as fictive temperature. In this work, we show that glass relaxation can be accurately modeled through a simplified “toy” enthalpy landscape approach, bypassing the use of fictive temperature. Moreover, the same simplified enthalpy landscape provides insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of crystallization. The toy landscape approach recovers key predictions from the traditional fictive temperature description, but it is based on a more accurate physical framework, giving fundamental knowledge of the glass relaxation and crystallization processes.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1007/s12633-021-01002-w
Endocrowns Clinical Performance and Patient Satisfaction: A Randomized Clinical Trial of Three Monolithic Ceramic Restorations,"© 2021 by the American College of ProsthodontistsPurpose: The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, clinical trial was to assess the survival of endocrowns made from three different monolithic ceramic materials, and to evaluate patient satisfaction. Materials and Methods: Fifty-three patients (sixty root canal treated molar teeth) were enrolled. Teeth were prepared to a flat butt-joint margin and randomly divided between three material groups: lithium disilicate-reinforced glass-ceramic, monolithic zirconia and polymer infiltrated hybrid ceramic. Predefined cementation protocols were used. Clinical assessment using modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria was carried out after two years by two independent clinicians blinded to the material used. Radiographic examination was conducted to check for the presence of caries, excess cement, and periapical infection. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests as well as the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate. Results: Forty-eight patients were available for assessment after 2 years (recall rate 90.6%). The overall Kaplan-Meier survival estimate among all groups was 90.9% with no statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.17). Three zirconia endocrowns debonded after 9, 10 and 13 months (82.4% survival rate), while 2 hybrid ceramic endocrowns chipped/fractured (89.5% survival rate). Lithium disilicate endocrowns had a 100% survival rate. The Kruskal Wallis test revealed no statistically significant difference between the groups in the USPHS criteria ratings and the radiographic assessment (P>0.05). Patient satisfaction ranged from 82.3% in the zirconia group to 100% in both the lithium disilicate and hybrid ceramic groups. Conclusions: Endocrowns provide a predictable option for the restoration of endodontically treated molar teeth in the short term. Lithium disilicate-reinforced ceramic had fewer complications and required less intervention compared with zirconia and hybrid ceramics. Long-term follow-up is required to substantiate these study results.",Journal of Prosthodontics,10.1007/s12633-020-00827-1
"Slag design and iron capture mechanism for recovering low-grade Pt, Pd, and Rh from leaching residue of spent auto-exhaust catalysts","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Recovery of platinum group metals (PGMs) from secondary resources has attracted worldwide attention from environmental and economic points of view. Pyrometallurgical routes exhibit the superiority in terms of efficiency and contamination control compared to hydrometallurgical process. However, traditional pyrometallurgical processes face the challenges of excessive flux and energy consumption. In this paper, an iron capture process was proposed to recover low-grade PGMs from leaching residue of spent auto-exhaust catalysts. Slag design was explored aimed at reducing the addition amount of flux. The optimized smelting conditions were as follows: 1400 °C for 30 min, adding 40.0 wt% CaO, 22.7 wt% Na2CO3, 5.0 wt% Na2B4O7, 5.0 wt% CaF2, 15.0 wt% Fe, and 5.0 wt% C. The concentrations of Pt, Pd and Rh remaining in the smelting slag were 0.83 g/t, 4.99 g/t, and 1.47 g/t, respectively. Furthermore, the 50 kg-scale experiment implied positive economic feasibility because of saving flux dosage and smelting time. The capture mechanism was revealed by investigating the formation of the metals phase and slag phase. Matrix formed slag phase and separate with metals phase owing to differences in chemical bonding, density, viscosity, and surface tension. PGMs were proved solubilized in α-Fe as substitutional solid solutions. The formation energies for Fe[sbnd]Pt, Fe[sbnd]Pd, and Fe[sbnd]Rh alloys were −4.149 eV, −4.040 eV, and −4.360 eV, respectively. Finally, the obtained CaO-SiO2-Al2O3-Na2O glass slag was used for producing glass ceramics. To sum up, the iron capture process realized low energy and material consumption, high recovery efficiency of PGMs, and resource utilization of the glass slag.",Science of the Total Environment,10.1016/j.prosdent.2020.06.027
"Fault-controlled carbonate-hosted barite-fluorite mineral systems: The Shuanghe deposit, Yangtze Block, South China","© 2021 International Association for Gondwana ResearchFault-controlled carbonate-hosted Ba-F deposits occur in many major orogenic belts of the world and are important repositories of fluorine production required in various fields of chemical, metallurgical glass, ceramic, and cement industries. Here we investigate the poorly documented Shuanghe barite-fluorite deposit in the Yangtze Block of South China. This deposit offers an excellent case for studying the processes of formation of fault-controlled carbonate-hosted barite-fluorite mineral system. The orebodies in Shuanghe are hosted in carbonate rocks belonging to the early Ordovician Honghuayuan Formation and are dominantly controlled by NE-trending faults. Fluorite and barite exhibit similar rare earth element patterns with positive Eu anomalies and negative Ce anomalies. We report fluorite Sm–Nd isotopic data which yielded an isochron age of 103.1 ± 1.3 Ma. The δ18OV‐SMOW values range from +0.2‰ to +1.1‰ and the δDV‐SMOW values show a range of –33.1‰ to −26.3‰. The δ34SV-CDT values for barite range from 31.1‰ to 38.2‰. The bulk and in-situ Sr values for fluorite and barite show a range of 0.709081 to 0.712258. The petrological and geochemical data reported in this study suggest the following processes: (1) derivation of the ore-forming fluid from basinal water mixed with meteoric water; and (2) origin of the ore-forming components from Cambrian carbonate rocks, black shale, and Ordovician limestone. We propose a model that correlates the tectonic background of mineralisation with the Late Cretaceous subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Oceanic plate.",Gondwana Research,10.1016/j.bsecv.2020.07.005
"Aboriginal uses for introduced glass, ceramic and flint from the former Schofields Aerodrome, Western Sydney (Darug Country), New South Wales","© 2021 Australian Archaeological Association Inc.Since permanent colonial incursion in 1788, Aboriginal groups around Australia incorporated introduced materials for a variety of tasks. However, relatively little is known about Aboriginal uses of bottle glass and ceramic flakes because there have only been two published use-wear analyses concerning bottle glass and none for ceramic. Excavations at the historical site of the former Schofields Aerodrome in New South Wales yielded flakes of both materials as well as introduced flint. We draw on actualistic experiments to inform interpretations of use-wear among the 279 archaeological specimens. Results demonstrate that glass, ceramic and flint were indeed used at the former Schofields Aerodrome site, for tools to work other materials. This is the first evidence for such use of ceramic flakes, which had previously only been known to have been used as end-products, such as spear tips. Use-wear also indicates that, contrary to common assumptions, thicker parts of glass bottles were not always preferred for tools and that across each raw material, tools were predominantly shards rather than intentionally knapped flakes. We infer that while ascribing motives to past behaviours is complex, the use of the introduced materials represents agency in Aboriginal people’s engagement with the incoming colonial culture.",Australian Archaeology,10.1016/j.bsecv.2020.07.002
Spray-dried sol-gel glass-ceramic powders based on the tunable thermal expansion of quartz and keatite solid solutions,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyLithium aluminosilicate glass-ceramic powders were synthesized by the heat treatment of spray-dried sol-gel glassy nanobeads, obtaining quartz solid solution (Qss) and keatite solid solution (Kss) crystals. Their composition ranged between 75 mol% SiO2 and pure silica along the spodumene join. The metastable crystals displayed tunable coefficients of thermal expansion ranging from +30 × 10−6 to −2.7 × 10−6 K−1 at room temperature, as obtained from their crystallographic characterization. The solid solution boundaries of Kss could be extended to 85 mol% SiO2. Concurrently, X-ray diffraction measurements performed in situ at high temperature and at cryogenic conditions confirmed the known linear shift of the high-low quartz inversion temperature upon increasing Al+Li doping. The obtained results qualify aerosol synthesis as a very versatile method for the production of glass-ceramic powders in the LAS system.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,
Shear bond strength of bi-layered all ceramics systems with finite element and acoustic emission analysis,"© 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Success of all-ceramic dental restorations depends on the cohesive strength of the strong ceramic core, the esthetic veneer and the bonding of their interface. Shear bond strength and failure modes of commercially available all-ceramics systems (IPS e.max Ceram/Press and IPS e.max Ceram/Katana) with adhesively luted experimental ceramic was investigated in the study. The maximum principal stresses (MPS) in finite element analysis and the amplitude intensities during acoustic emission analysis (AE) were further correlated with their failure modes during shear bond test. Shear bond strength between the core-veneer specimens were tested with a universal testing machine at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min with acoustic emission sensors to investigate fracture mode. Three dimensional geometric models were built to simulate shear bond test. Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney post hoc test were used to compare the shear bond strength and AE amplitudes between the groups. Median and interquartile ranges of shear bond strength in glass-ceramic systems were 26 MPa (10.74) and in zirconia, was 22 MPa (8.5) respectively. Cohesive core fractures in glass-ceramics and mixed mode/adhesive fractures were observed in zirconia and experimental ceramic. MPS values in glass-ceramic and zirconia groups were comparable. Statistically significant differences between initial, final fracture loads and AE amplitudes were seen within the ceramic groups. Fracture modes in glass-ceramic core-veneers suggest a strong core-veneer bonding than in zirconia. Finite element and acoustic emission analysis can be explored to predict the failure modes of bi-layered ceramics.",Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology,
"Dissolution, bioactivity behavior, and cytotoxicity of 19.58Li2O·11.10ZrO2·69.32SiO2 glass–ceramic","© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Glass and bioactive glass–ceramic can be used in several applications. In bone growth where good bone/biomaterial adhesion was required, bioactive coatings for implants can improve bone formation. The glass and glass–ceramics of the LZS (Li2O-ZrO2-SiO2) system are very interesting because of their mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. Very recently, their biological response in contact with human osteoblast has been evaluated. However, despite several initiatives, there are still no studies that systematically assess this system's bioactivity, dissolution, and cytotoxicity in vitro. This work aims to investigate the dissolution, bioactivity behavior, and cytotoxicity of LZS glass–ceramic. LZS glass–ceramics were produced from SiO2, Li2CO3, and ZrSiO4 by melting followed by quenching. The obtained glass frits were milled and uniaxially pressed and heat-treated at 800 and 900°C and submitted to physical–chemical, structural and mechanical characterization. Their dissolution behavior was studied in Tris–HCl, while bioactivity was performed in simulated solution body fluid (SBF). The cytotoxicity test was performed using glass–ceramic in direct contact with mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (SC) isolated from human exfoliated deciduous teeth. Structural and microstructural analyzes confirmed bioactivity. The results show that it was possible to produce bioactive glass–ceramic from LZS, proven by the formation of new calcium phosphate structures such as hydroxyapatite on the surface of the samples after exposure to SBF. The SC viability test performed indicated that the materials were not cytotoxic at 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/ml. The glass–ceramic system under study is very promising for a medicinal application that requires bioactivity and/or biocompatibility for bone regeneration.",Journal of Biomedical Materials Research - Part B Applied Biomaterials,
Fatigue behavior of endodontically treated maxillary premolars with MOD defects under different minimally invasive restorations,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Objectives: To analyze the stress distribution and subsequent fracture resistance of human maxillary premolars with mesial-occlusal-distal (MOD) defects restored with different minimally invasive restorations. Materials and methods: Seventy non-carious human maxillary premolars were selected and divided into seven groups (n = 10). Ten teeth without further preparation served as control. The remaining teeth were endodontically treated and received three restorative patterns: inlays without cusp coverage (I), onlays with palatal coverage (O), overlays with both buccal and palatal coverage (Ov). Lithium disilicate glass ceramics (EM) and machinable composite resin (LU) were used for restoration. Specimens were tested under cycling loading with tongue direction of 45° for 1.2 × 106 cycles at a 50-N load and 2.0-Hz frequency. The survival time and two fracture mode classifications were assessed. Three-dimensional models of each group were designed. The magnitude and pattern of stresses were analyzed under the same condition of the in vitro test using finite element stress analysis. Results: Although the overlay model pattern produced more favorable stress distribution, three restorative patterns restored with the same material had no difference in survival curves (P > 0.05). Only the survival curve of the EM-Ov group had no statistical difference with that of the control group (P > 0.05). EM groups presented mainly interface adhesive failure, while LU groups were mainly material cohesive failure. Conclusion: For the endodontically treated maxillary premolars with MOD defect, the lithium disilicate glass ceramic overlay pattern can reach the best restorative effect. Clinical relevance: Comparing with restorative pattern, restorative material had a greater influence on the minimally invasive restoration of posterior teeth.",Clinical Oral Investigations,
"Therapeutic effect of a novel bioactive glass-ceramics on early caries lesions: a single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial","© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Objectives: To investigate the therapeutic effect of a novel bioactive glass-ceramics (BGC) called Huaxi BGC (HX-BGC) on early caries lesions. Materials and methods: A total of 195 patients who meeting inclusion criteria were recruited and randomized to three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. The patients in the treatment group received fluoride varnish which contained 5% sodium fluoride (NaF) or distilled water which contained 7.5% HX-BGC once a month for 3 months, and the control group received placebos. Quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) images were taken at baseline and at the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. Results: The three groups had similar baseline characteristics, including age, gender, and QLF parameters (ΔF, area, and ΔQ). Compared with baseline, the ΔQ values were significantly decreased in the HX-BGC and NaF groups at 1 and 3 months (p<0.005), while no statistically significant changes were found in that of the control group. After adjusting for baseline measurements, both of the 5% NaF and 7.5% HX-BGC showed a significant therapeutic effect in the treatment of initial enamel lesions at 1 month and 3 months, when compared to those receiving placebos (ΔQ, p<0.05). Moreover, the ΔQ value of the HX-BGC group decreased by a slightly more amount than that of the NaF group at 1 month (p=0.048). Similar trends were also found for the values of ΔF and area. Conclusion: Our results suggest that HX-BGC may serve as a promising bioactive material for the treatment of early caries lesions. Clinical relevance: HX-BGC holds a great promise to be used as a novel bioactive material for the treatment of early caries lesions.",Clinical Oral Investigations,
Impact of the Microstructure of CAD/CAM Blocks on the Bonding Strength and the Bonded Interface,"© 2021 by the American College of ProsthodontistsPurpose: To investigate the relationship between the microstructure of CAD/CAM blocks and the quality of adhesion as function of the surface treatment and resin cement type. Materials and methods: Two nano-ceramic composite resin CAD/CAM blocks, Lava Ultimate (LU) and Cerasmart (CS), and two Leucite-reinforced glass ceramic CAD/CAM IPS blocks, Empress® CAD (EM) and InitialTM LRF (IR), received either Hydrofluoric acid (HF) or sandblasting (SB) surface treatments. The blocks were then luted using two dual-cure resin cements, LinkForce (LF) and Multilink Automix (ML) with their corresponding silanes, resulting in 16 study groups. The luted blocks were then thermal-cycling (TC) for 5000 cycles and subjected to a microtensile bond strength (μTBS) test. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the treated surfaces were analyzed using ImageJ software and XRD analyses were performed for the two ceramic blocks. The data obtained were submitted to Games-Howell post-hoc nonparametric test to compare combinations of groups or treatments and a linear mixed-effects model for the factors surface treatment, block type, and resin cement, together with their first-degree interactions (α = 0.05). Results: The lowest mean μTBS values were obtained with LU-HF, whereas the highest mean μTBS values were obtained with CS regardless of resin cement type and surface treatment method. IR-HF mean μTBS were significantly higher than IR-SB, EM-SB, and EM-HF. Analysis using ImageJ software demonstrated significant differences in the density and pore size after HF surface treatment. Conclusions: The specific microstructure of each block material within the same family group impacted the micromechanical retention and the bonded interface strength.",Journal of Prosthodontics,
Crystallization and sintering studies on an anomalous Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 glass for making tunable thermal expansion ceramic,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyThis work is an attempt to understand the crystallization behavior of unconventional LAS (1:1.2:7) composition having MgO, BaO, K2O, and ZrO2. Crystallization parameters were determined using thermo-analytical models based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The activation energy of crystallization, E, and frequency factor, (Formula presented.) were calculated to be 354.40 kJ mol–1K–1 and 1.63 × 1015, respectively. Effect of sintering temperature on density, phase constitution, thermal expansion, and microstructure is reported herein. The temperature range between 1373 K and 1473 K was found to be the optimum window for sintering the glass particles. Glass-ceramic with CTE matching the Fe–Ni alloy is reported herein. Considering the LAS glass system's better sinterability, efforts were made toward sintering alumina with LAS glass as a sintering aid. The 5 wt%. LAS/Al2O3 composite was prepared with density: 3.6 g/cm3, relative permittivity 10.5, and dielectric loss tangent 2.45 × 10-3. This composition was found to be a potential CTE compensator material while processing tailorable CTE ceramics.",International Journal of Applied Glass Science,
Optical Properties of SiO2 – TiO2 – La2O3 – Na2O – Y2O3 Glasses and A Novel Process of Preparing the Parent Glass-Ceramics,"© 2021, Springer Nature B.V.Quaternary glasses with the composition 50SiO2 – 25TiO2 – 5La2O3 – (20-x) Na2O – xY2O3 where x : (0 ≤ x ≥ 10) were synthesized using the melt-quench technique. XRD examined the nature of prepared glasses. UV-spectroscopic of investigated glass system studied at room temperature. Both optical bandgap and refractive index of the present glass have been increased. The polarizability and basicity were determined. Thermal parameter values increased as Y2O3 increased. Under controlling heat, the glass-ceramic were prepared and confirmed using XRD. Glass-ceramics are examined using SEM to evaluate a microstructure. Ultrasonic velocities and elastic-moduli of glass-ceramic samples are increased because of the increase in internal energy. The role of Y2O3 modifier in the glass system is clearly demonstrated. Y2O3 also works as an excellent nucleating agent that can induce crystallizations, supporting in the creation of the sub-phase of glass-ceramics.",Silicon,
"Physical, Radiation Shielding and Crystallization Properties of Na2O-Bi2O3- MoO3-B2O3- SiO2-Fe2O3 Glasses","© 2020, Springer Nature B.V.The melt-quenching method has been used to fabricate 9Na2O-(30-x) Bi2O3- xMoO3-40B2O3- 20SiO2-1Fe2O3 glass system where x = (0 ≤ x ≤ 15 mol%). The XRD diffractometer procedure was used to check the status of these samples. Inter-ionic distance (Ri) between Mo–Mo, Polaron radius rp, and inter-nuclear distance ri reduce with the Mo content due to reduce of molar volume. The two-photon absorption coefficient TPA increase with the increase of MoO3 this increased connected to Eg. The values of ionicity Ib slightly increase and the covalency of these glasses reduce with a growth in MoO3 content. The XRD patterns of glass-ceramic show (Na2B4O7), B2Si2O5, Na2SiO3, Fe7BSi3O18, and LiBi (MoO4)2. The morphological of the glass-ceramic has been studied by SEM. FT-IR spectroscopic investigations of the glass-ceramic samples were applied to check the characteristic structure. Mass attenuation coefficient of the prepared samples decreased with the energy increase and with the addition of MoO3.",Silicon,
Comparison of mechanical properties of different reinforced glass-ceramics,"© 2020 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Data concerning the mechanical properties of the newly developed lithium disilicate ceramic HS10PC are lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the flexural strength (FS), Martens hardness (HM), indentation modulus (EIT), fracture load (FL), and wear resistance (WR) of HS10PC compared with those of the established glass-ceramics IPS e.max Press and IPS Empress Esthetic. Material and methods: Four pressable glass-ceramics were examined: HS10PC (estetic ceram ag), IPS e.max Press low translucency (LT) and high translucency (HT; Ivoclar Vivadent AG), and IPS Empress Esthetic (ES; Ivoclar Vivadent AG). For each material, a total of 85 specimens were fabricated. Specimens were subdivided into 4 groups for FS (n=30), HM, EIT (n=10), and FL measurement according to the Voss test after artificial aging in an autoclave (n=15), artificial aging in a mastication simulator (n=15), and no artificial aging (n=15). In addition, WR (n=10) was measured after 240 000, 600 000, and 1 200 000 masticatory cycles. Data were statistically analyzed using the global univariate ANOVA, the Scheffé post hoc and paired t tests, and Weibull distribution (α=.05). Results: HT showed the highest FS, while ES presented the lowest FS of all groups (P<.001). ES showed lower values for HM (P<.001), EIT (P<.001), and FL for specimens treated in an autoclave and mastication simulator (P<.001) compared with all other groups. An increase in the wear of the ceramic and enamel antagonist between 240 000 and 1 200 000 masticatory cycles was observed for all groups (P<.001). After 1 200 000 masticatory cycles, HS10PC presented less wear of the ceramic than the other 3 materials (P=.003). Conclusions: The newly developed lithium disilicate ceramic HS10PC showed comparable results with the established IPS e.max Press for FS, HM, EIT, FL, and WR. Lithium disilicate ceramics presented higher mechanical results than the leucite-reinforced ES, with all the ceramics showing similar results for the WR of the enamel antagonist.",Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,
Basaltic glass-ceramic: A short review Vitrocerámica basáltica: una breve revisión,"© 2020 SECVBasalts, which cover about 70% of the Earth's surface, are igneous rocks originating from cooling and solidifying the magma on the Earth's surface. Products obtained from the melting of rocks have a wide market and can be considered the precursors of glass-ceramic technology. These materials are promising due to the possibility of converting low-cost natural raw materials into products with excellent mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties.

Mechanochemical and in vitro cytocompatibility evaluation of zirconia modified silver substituted 1393 bioactive glasses Evaluación de citocompatibilidad mecanoquímica e in vitro de vidrios bioactivos 1393 sustituidos con plata modificada con zirconia,"© 2020 SECVZirconia and silver oxide substituted 1393 bioactive glasses (1393Zr and 1393Zr–1Ag) were prepared by sol-gel technique and sintered at 900–1100 °C. ZrO2 incorporation into the glass was on the sole purpose of mechanical performance augmentation, while Ag2O being antibacterial, their incorporation on microbial efficacy, in vitro bioactivity and cytocompatibility were assessed. The Ag2O incorporated glass showed minimal effect on bioactivity of the parent glass. Both the cytocompatibility (U2-OS cells using MTT assay) and antibacterial efficacy (by using Bacillus subtilis; and Escherichia coli) were found significantly improved in silver doped glass than the undoped one. Excellent mechanical performance was also observed in 1393Zr-1Ag compared to the both pure 1393 glass and 1393Zr. Thus, Ag2O incorporation into 1393Zr not only introduced the bactericidal efficacy, but also enhanced the mechanical properties of the glass, while leaving bioactivity unharmed. Thus the Ag2O incorporated 1393Zr seems a potential biomaterial for bone tissue engineering application.",Boletin de la Sociedad Espanola de Ceramica y Vidrio,
