General Synthesis of Single-Atom Catalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reactions and Room-Temperature Na-S Batteries
Universality in preparing samples with atomic metal dopants is vital to expand the diversity of single-atom materials and their widespread applications. We provide a comprehensive library of single atoms for systematically investigating their different electrocatalytic behaviors in HER and RT Na-S batteries. In particular, the tuning of single-atom local structures can achieve unexpected performance in general electrochemistry. Herein, we report a comprehensive strategy to synthesize a full range of single-atom metals on carbon matrix, including V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ge, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, In, Sn, W, Ir, Pt, Pb, and Bi. The extensive applications of various SACs are manifested via their ability to electro-catalyze typical hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and conversion reactions in novel room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries (RT-Na-S). The enhanced performances for these electrochemical reactions arisen from the ability of different single active atoms on local structures to tune their electronic configuration. Significantly, the electrocatalytic behaviors of diverse SACs, assisted by density functional theory calculations, are systematically revealed by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and in situ transmission electronic microscopy, providing a strategic library for the general synthesis and extensive applications of SACs in energy conversion and storage.
