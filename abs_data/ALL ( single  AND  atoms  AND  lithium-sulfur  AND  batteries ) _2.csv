Modulation of the electronic and magnetic properties of pyridinic N-doped graphene with Ni/Cr,"© 2023 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.We have explored the interaction of Ni/Cr with pyridinic N-doped graphene and its influence on the electronic and magnetic characteristics of graphene using a density functional theory (DFT) approach. A 5 × 5 graphene supercell with a single vacancy is modeled. Initially, the concentration of nitrogen atoms is varied in the pyridinic configuration of graphene. The structures, thus obtained, are decorated with Ni/Cr atoms. For configurations without transition metals (TMs), the calculated electronic band structures show a downward shift in Fermi level that decreases as nitrogen concentration increases. Furthermore, it is found that these structures manifest metallic behavior along with some flat bands near the Fermi level. With the addition of Ni/Cr atoms, the movement of the Fermi level toward the conduction band is noticed. The opening of the bandgap at the K-point also varies slightly with the concentration of N atoms and/or the presence of TM atoms. The structures P1N-Ni and P2N-Ni transmute into semiconductors. A significant increase in the magnetic moment is found with the adsorption of the Ni/Cr atom. The analysis of spin-polarized partial density of states proves that higher magnetic moments following TM absorption are mainly on account of the Ni/Cr-3d orbitals and their hybridization with C-2p orbitals. These findings suggest that functionalizing TMs on pyridinic N (Nitrogen)-doped graphene can drastically alter their electronic and magnetic properties.",International Journal of Computational Materials Science and Engineering
"Cobalt/nitrogen co-carved carbon nanorod for efficient Fenton-like reaction: Degradation efficacy, reaction mechanism and singlet oxygen generation","© 2022The Fenton-like process shows promising potential to generate reactive oxygen species for the remediation of increasingly environmental pollutants. However, the slow development of high-activity catalysts with strong stability and low leaching of metal ions has greatly inhibited scale-up application of this technology. Here, cobalt (Co)/nitrogen (N) atom co-curved carbon nanorod (CoNC) containing highly uniform CoNx active sites is developed as a Fenton-like catalyst for the effective catalytic oxidation of various organics via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation with high stability. As confirmed by the experimental results, singlet oxygen (1O2) is the dominant active species for the degradation of the organics, with a proportion of 100%. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations indicate that CoN2C2 is the most effective ligand structure with more negative adsorption energy for PMS and the shortest length Co–O bond, while the most reasonable generation pathway for 1O2 was CoN2C2–PMS → CoN2C2–OH* → 2O* → 1O2. Further studies demonstrate that the electron can be transferred from the highest occupied molecular orbitals of the organics to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the PMS via CoN2C2 action. In addition, the CoNC presents strong resistance to inorganic ions and natural organic matter in the Fenton-like catalysis process. The presence of CoN2C2 active centre can significantly shorten the migration distance of the 1O2 generated from PMS activation, which further enhances the Fenton-like catalytic activity in terms of mineralising various organic contaminants with high efficiency over a wide pH range.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
Iodine-doped single-atom cobalt catalysts with boosted antioxidant enzyme-like activity for colitis therapy,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Doping with heteroatoms was performed as an effective strategy for modulating the electronic structure of single metal atom and further enhancing the catalytic activity of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Single-atom cobalt catalysts anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon (CoCN) have achieved considerable attention in biosensors and anti-inflammation therapy. How to further improve the antioxidant activity of CoCN for satisfying their biomedical applications is a hot topic. Here, we synthesized a series of halogen-doped CoCN, obtained CoCNF, CoCNCl, CoCNBr and CoCNI. We found the catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) -like catalytic activities of CoCNCl, CoCNBr and CoCNI significantly increased than that of CoCN. Especially, CoCNI exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity. Finally, we used CoCNI as the remarkable reactive oxygen species (ROS) eliminating material in protecting cellular against oxidase stress in vitro and colitis therapy in vivo. Our work opens a new insight to design SACs with high catalytic activities by halogen doping for ROS-relative disease therapy.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Unraveling the hierarchical porous structure in natural pollen-derived Fe-containing carbon to address the shuttle effect and dead sulfur problems in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Mesoporous carbon–metal composites with the merits of strong adsorption ability over soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), excellent sulfur dispersion, high conductivity, low cost, and rapid catalytic conversion rate to suppress the shuttle effect are promising in lithium-sulfur batteries. However, their application is usually limited by structural collapse and fast fading because of the poorly dispersed metal-based compounds in the mesoporous carbon host during high-temperature synthesis. Herein, a 3D rape pollen-derived carbon (RPDC) containing Fe-based compounds as the sulfur host is prepared through the solid-state reaction of simultaneous carbonization between natural rape pollen and ferrous oxalate. Characterizations confirm that Fe-RPDC composites have stronger physiochemical adsorption and catalytic ability than pure RPDC, Fe-doped commercial activated carbon, and pure Fe3O4. Then, soluble LiPSs are adsorbed, fixed on the surface of the Fe-RPDC composites and catalyzed by Fe-based compounds to reduce the “dead sulfur”. Finally, a mature natural structure-derived hollow carbon-iron compound system is developed. The lithium-sulfur battery assembled using Fe-RPDC as host showed excellent long-term stability and a high electron transport rate. The Fe-RPDC@S composite with 69.6 wt% sulfur content exhibits the highest initial discharge capacity of 955.7 mA h g−1 at a rate of 1 C and can be maintained at 556.3 mA h g−1 even after 150 cycles. The decay rate is only 0.03 % per cycle, and the average Coulomb efficiency is approximately 98 %. Hence, the reasonable design of Fe-RPDC composites is of great significance for promoting the transformation of polysulfide intermediates and chemically anchoring soluble LiPSs to restrain “dead sulfur” and can be used to realize low-cost, green and large-scale production.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Sulfur-induced electron redistribution of single molybdenum atoms promotes nitrogen electroreduction to ammonia,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is considered a sustainable approach that endows NH3 production from N2 and H2O under ambient conditions. Due to the sluggish adsorption/activation of N2 and the strong competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction, advanced NRR electrocatalysts with both high activity and selectivity are required. Herein, we demonstrate a local modulation strategy that simultaneously promotes NRR selectivity and activity on molybdenum-based single atom catalysts (SACs) by sulfur-induced electronic redistribution, delivering a NH3 yield rate of 46.6 μg·h−1·mgcat−1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 28.9% at a potential of − 0.2 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M HCl under ambient conditions. This study provides a promising strategy for synergizing the selectivity and activity of electrocatalysts toward multistep NRR. Moreover, such an atomic-level engineering strategy should be applicable to other SACs in general and may have a major impact on their use in electrocatalytic applications.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Synergistic coupling of Ni3ZnC0.7 decorated with homogeneous multimetal CoNiCuFe nitrogen-codoped carbon matrix as high-entropy catalysts for efficient overall water splitting,"© 2022Due to unique electrical properties and high catalytic efficiency, transition metal nitrogen-codoped carbide (TM–N–C) has attracted tremendous interest as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. Unlike traditional single-source modification, herein a novel pomegranate-like high-entropy (HE) electrocatalyst of Ni3ZnC0.7 decorated with homogeneous multimetal (Fe, Co, Cu, and Ni) nitrogen-codoped carbon matrix (Ni3ZnC0.7@CoNiCuFe–NC) is reported. It can be implemented by the simple thermal annealing method of multimetal codoped zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF). Benefiting from the synergistic effects of plentiful TM–N–C species, template effect of ZIF and distinct nanoporous structure, HE electrocatalyst Ni3ZnC0.7@CoNiCuFe–NC exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance. When applied in strong alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH), the overpotentials of Ni3ZnC0.7@CoNiCuFe–NC present as low as 202 and 97 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm−2 current density. Surprisingly as a bifunctional electrode, it can achieve the low cell voltage of 1.53 V at 10 mA cm−2 current density for overall water splitting, which is comparable to conventional IrO2||Pt/C electrode and superior to the recently reported analogous bifunctional catalysts. Thus, the work proposes the direction for the rational design of homogeneous distribution of TM–N–C material for water splitting in the green hydrogen energy industry.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
"Synergistic engineering of cobalt selenide and biomass-derived S, N, P co-doped hierarchical porous carbon for modulation of stable Li-S batteries","© 2022Hierarchical porous carbon co-doped with heterogeneous atoms has attracted much attention thanks to sizable internal void space accommodating electrolyte, high-density microporous structure physically confining polysulfides (LPS), and heterogeneous atoms serving as active sites to capture LPS. However, solely relying on carbon material defects to capture LPS proves ineffective. Hence, metal compounds must be introduced to chemisorb LPS. Herein, cobalt ions are in-situ grown on the polydopamine layer coated on the surface of biomass-derived S, N, P co-doped hierarchical porous carbon (SNP-PC). Then a layer of nitrogen-doped porous carbon (MPC) dotted with CoSe nanoparticles is acquired by selenizing. Thus, a strong-polar/weak-polar composite material of SNP-PC studded with CoSe nanoparticles is obtained (SNP-PC@MPC@CoSe). Button cells assembled with SNP-PC@MPC@CoSe-modified separator enable superb long-cycle stability and satisfactory rate performance. An excellent rate capacity of 796 mAh g−1 at a high current rate of 4 C with an ultra-low capacity fading of 0.06% over 700 cycles can be acquired. More impressively, even in a harsh test condition of 5.65 mg cm−2 sulfur loading and 4 μL mg−1 ratio of electrolyte to active materials, the battery can still display a specific capacity of 980 mAh g−1 (area capacity of ∼5.54 mAh cm−2) at 0.1 C. This work provides a promising route toward high-performance Li-S batteries.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
Deep eutectic solvent induced ultrathin Co4N/N-doped carbon nanosheets self-supporting electrode for boosting hydrogen evolution integrated with biomass electrooxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal nitrides are considered promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction integrated with electrooxidation reaction of biomass due to their metal-like properties. However, the synthesis of metal nitrides involves multi-step reactions and requires continuous reactions under a large amount of NH3 atmosphere. Herein, we exploit deep eutectic solvent (DES) to induce in-situ synthesize N-doped carbon (NC) composite Co4N ultrathin nanosheets self-supporting electrode on carbon cloth (Co4N/NC@CC) without additional input NH3 atmosphere. XAFS spectra showed that the strong interaction between Co4N and NC accelerated the electron transport at the interface, and the ultrathin nanostructure of Co4N/NC is beneficial to increasing the catalytic active sites, thereby effectively improving the catalytic performance of Co4N/NC@CC. During the HER process, Co4N/NC@CC only needs 62, 98, and 60 mV overpotentials to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm2 in alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes. When Co4N/NC@CC is used to produce 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and hydrogen fuel synchronously in alkaline electrolytes, only a low voltage of 1.38 V is required at 10 mA/cm2, and the conversion rate of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is close to 100 % and the selectivity of FDCA is 98.6 %.",Applied Surface Science
A metal-organic framework derived approach to fabricate in-situ carbon encapsulated Bi/Bi2O3 heterostructures as high-performance anodes for potassium ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Bismuth-based materials are regarded as promising anode materials for potassium ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity and low working potential. However, the large volume expansion and sluggish kinetics during cycling are major limitations to their practical application. Herein, a unique Bi/Bi2O3-C heterostructure was designed through a simple Bi-metal–organic framework (MOF) modulation-pyrolysis process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction revealed that the Bi and Bi2O3 can form hetero-particles, which were uniformly embedded in a plate-like carbon skeleton, constructing a Bi/Bi2O3-C heterostructure. The carbon skeleton and the formation of numerous hetero-interfaces between Bi, Bi2O3, and carbon can effectively promote the interfacial charge transfer, shorten the K+ diffusion pathway, and alleviate the volume expansion of Bi/Bi2O3 during potassiation. Consequently, the Bi/Bi2O3-C heterostructure exhibited a high reversible capacity of 426.0 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1, excellent cycle performance of 251.8 mAh g−1 after 350 cycles with a capacity retention of 76.6 %, and superior rate capability of 82.7 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, demonstrating its promising potential for the application of PIBs anode.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
NiMn-based metal-organic framework with optimized eg orbital occupancy as efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for lithium-oxygen batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Rational design and synthesis of highly efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is significant for rechargeable lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs). In this work, a bimetal coupling strategy has been adopted to fabricate Ni/Mn bimetal-organic framework (Ni/Mn-MOF). The LOBs equipped with NiMn0.05-MOF electrocatalyst exhibit excellent performances with large specific capacity of 28,464 mAh/g and extraordinary stability of 524 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Combining with the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, it is found that the doped Mn cations enable triggering the redistribution of 3d electron in Ni sites, adjusting eg orbital occupancy of Ni and strengthening the hybridization between Ni −3d and O −2p orbits due to the intense electron coupling between Ni and Mn ions, which greatly optimizes the inherent absorption capability of NiMn0.05-MOF for LiO2 intermediate and thus decreases the energy barriers of oxygen redox reactions.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects on further development of efficient COF-based photocatalysts are indicated.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Metal-organic framework-based catalysts for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been regarded as one of the most promising successors to lithium-ion batteries owing to their high energy density, low cost and environmental friendliness. However, their practical applications are seriously hindered by the poor overall performance arising from the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and polysulfide shuttle effect. Over the last few years, introducing catalysts in the cathodic part to accelerate the polysulfide conversion and fundamentally inhibit the shuttle effect has become extensively studied research topics. Various catalytic materials have been employed to boost the whole performance of LSBs. Among them, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as a new family of porous coordination polymers have aroused enormous research interest because of their tunable structure, diverse compositions and functional versatility. Herein, recent progress of MOF-based catalysts toward facilitating polysulfide conversion for LSBs is systematically reviewed for the first time. First, the involved redox mechanism and catalysis in LSBs are briefly summarized. Then, pristine MOF, MOF composites and MOF derivatives as catalysts for improving the electrochemical performance are discussed.

Unveiling the synergistic catalysis essence of trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni phosphides for lithium–sulfur chemistry,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) have emerged as prospective candidates for energy storage systems due to their high energy density and low cost of sulfur. However, the fast capacity degradation stemming from the fatal lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle and sluggish redox reaction kinetic acts as the bottleneck for the real implementation of LSBs. Herein, we propose a well-designed nanosphere functionalized with trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni phosphides (FCNP) to host sulfur and promote the sulfur redox reactions. The well-dispersed trimetallic phosphides can not only enhance polarity and electron conductivity but also supply sufficient conversion sites and short sulfur evolution pathway. Therefore, the elaborated trimetallic phosphides on carbon nanosphere effectively inhibits LiPSs escaping from the cathode to anode. Further, the systematic electrochemical measurements and synchrotron X-ray three-dimensional nano-computed tomography (X-ray 3D nano-CT) results provide clear evidence that FCNP as a bidirectional electrocatalyst smoothly accelerates the generation and decomposition of Li2S. Accordingly, the S/FCNP cathode exhibits a remarkable discharge capacity of 1172.3 mA h g−1 at 0.2C in coin cell, 1164.0 mA h g−1 at 0.1C in pouch cell and the favorable cycling performance.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Ultrafast microwave-induced synthesis of lithiophilic oxides modified 3D porous mesh skeleton for high-stability Li-metal anode,"© 2022The wide application of Li metal anodes is hindered by the inhomogeneous growth of Li dendrites. Herein, we propose an ultrafast microwave-induced synthesis method for a lithiophilic 3D porous mesh skeleton converted by commercial brass mesh. Due to the lithiophilic oxides (FeO and CuO) granular layer and 3D porous structure, this novel skeleton can be used as a current collector to achieve a high-stability of Li metal anode. A dendrite-free deposition morphology Li metal anode is obtained with noticeable cycling stability up to 1000 h (2500 cycles) at 5 mA cm−2 current density with 1 mA h cm−2 capacity. This skeleton is used to assemble the full-cell with the commercial LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode. A stable full-cell is obtained with 87.2 % capacity retention after 500 cycles at 0.5C. The microwave-induced synthesis method in this work can prepare 3D lithiophilic skeleton in a brief period, which provides guidance for the design of Li metal anode.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Valence engineering at the interface of MoS2/Mo2C heterostructure for bionic nitrogen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The natural nitrogenase is still the most efficient catalyst on earth to reduce the ambient N2 into ammonia. The central part of the molecular machine is powered by a metallic core, usually a molybdenum atom, whose coordination valence state remains an enigma for us to unveil and mimic. Unlike the flexible bio-enzyme, inorganic heterogeneous catalysts are usually rigid in the coordination structure, making their valence states invariable, except some localized defects. In this study, we successfully synthesized a two-dimensional MoS2/Mo2C electrocatalyst, which contains a heterostructured interface with efficient charge and magnetism separation, exhibiting a gradual and broad valence state transition from Mo4+ to Mo2+.

Status and prospects of electrocatalysts for lithium-sulfur battery under lean electrolyte and high sulfur loading conditions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The high theoretical energy density (2600 Wh kg−1) and high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh/g) have led to the emergence of lithium-sulfur battery (LSB), which makes it one of the most potential energy storage systems to achieve commercialization in place of lithium-ion battery. Unfortunately, the slow kinetics and the shuttle effect of polysulfides in LSB severely hamper its rate performances and operating life. The cycling performances and sulfur utilization of LSB have been improved by most sulfur host materials as electrocatalysts under excess electrolyte. However, considering the practical application of LSB, lean electrolyte and high sulfur loading conditions are necessary. In this review, research progress of electrocatalysts in LSB under lean electrolyte and high sulfur loading conditions are introduced. Electrocatalysts are mainly divided into nonmetallic catalysts and metal-based catalysts. Nonmetallic catalysts include nonmetallic compounds, graphene, carbon nanotubes and heteroatom-doped carbon materials. Metal-based catalysts are composed of cobalt-based catalysts, molybdenum-based catalysts, iron-based catalysts and multi-metal-based heterostructures. The improvement battery performances and the related catalytic mechanism of electrocatalysts are comprehensively discussed.

Selective catalysis of single V atoms and VN1-x nanodots enables fast polysulfides conversion in lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022The application of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are mainly hindered by the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides and the sluggish kinetics of sulfur redox reaction. Hence, a bidirectional catalyst, in which single vanadium (V) atoms with V-N4 coordination and vanadium nitride nanodots with abundant nitrogen vacancies (VN1-x) are decorated on nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (VN1-x@V-NC), was designed to modify the separators for Li–S batteries. Theoretical calculations and experiments show that V-N4 and VN1-x sites display catalytic selectivity for the formation and decomposition of Li2S, respectively. Additionally, nitrogen-deficient VN1-x displays a strong affinity toward soluble polysulfides through V-S and Li-N bonds, and polysulfides are preferentially adsorbed near the nitrogen vacancies. Specially, the strong adsorption ability facilitates the subsequent conversion reaction at the dual-site. Consequently, a Li–S battery with VN1-x@V-NC modified separator based on pure S cathode displays a stable long-term cycling performance over 500 cycles at 2C. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance of pouch cell with 4 mg cm−2 S loading demonstrates the potential of the VN1-x @V-NC modified separator for practical application.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Application of transition metal boride nanosheet as sulfur host in high loading Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Two-dimensional (2D) metal boride material (MBene) has aroused concern recently. However, the research and application exploration for MBene materials with more exposure sites are seriously restricted due to lack of suitable preparation methods. Herein, a kind of composites of monolayer MBene nanosheets and carbon nanotube (mono-MBene/CNT) is prepared through ice template method for the first time and applicated as a novel cathode host in high-loading lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Benefiting from multifunctional advantages of mono-MBene/CNT cathode including anchoring lithium polysulfides (LiPS), multiple functional sites and fast lithium-ion transport, the cells with S@mono-MBene/CNT cathode exhibit superior long-term cycling performance over 1000 cycles. Most notably, even if the sulfur loading is up to 15.28 mg cm−2, the cells with S@mono-MBene/CNT cathode deliver an initial area capacity of 12.73 mAh cm−2 and the capacity can also maintain at 11.07 mAh cm−2 after 120 cycles (86.96 % capacity retention) with current density of 21.80 mA cm−2, which is approximately 3 times higher than the capacity of commercial lithium-ion batteries.

In this paper, MIL-88A(Fe) derived Fe3O4/C is designed as an efficient carrier to entrap Keplerate-type POM and form Mo72V30@Fe3O4/C composite catalyst. Due to the confined and synergistic effect of Fe3O4/C framework, as compared to other reported catalysts, Mo72V30@Fe3O4/C exhibits the highest catalytic activity and selectivity in aerobic oxidation of HMF with a 99.4 % conversion and a 100 % selectivity to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF). The Mo72V30@Fe3O4/C catalyst still shows a high activity even after ten cycles. A possible synergistic catalytic mechanism is proposed that Mo72V30@Fe3O4/C oxidizes HMF to DFF through a proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) process indicating the polymetallic center in Mo72V30@Fe3O4/C synergistically promotes this reaction.

Alleviating the self-discharge and enhancing the polysulphides conversion kinetics with LaCO3OH nanocrystals decorated hierarchical porous carbon,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been recognized as one of the most promising energy storage devices due to their ultrahigh energy density of 2600 Wh kg−1. However, their practical implementation is greatly impeded by the sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics, detrimental “shuttle effect” and severe self-discharge. In this work, LaCO3OH nanocrystals decorated nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet arrays (MNCS-La) are fabricated via an etching-embedding method, which is further applied as an advanced sulfur reservoir for Li-S batteries. The hierarchical porous architecture of carbon nanosheet arrays provides a huge pore volume, which not only buffers the volume fluctuation of active materials during the discharge–charge process, but also facilitates the electrolyte infiltration and ion diffusion. More importantly, the monodispersed LaCO3OH nanocrystals inhibit the shuttle effect and self-discharge by forming a strong La-S bond with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and simultaneously enhance the electrochemical conversion kinetics. Attributed to these synergistic features, the sulfur electrodes based on MNCS-La achieve enhanced electrochemical performance, such as an initial discharge capacity of 1230 mAh/g at 0.2 C and a low capacity attenuation of 0.048% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 1 C. This work provides a feasible structural design of host for the applications of Li-S batteries and calls more attention to lanthanide metals-based composite materials.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Recent progress of hollow structure platform in assisting oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Hydrogen production by water electrolysis has received extensive attention, mainly due to the fact that the process does not emit carbon dioxide and other pollutants. Whereas, the kinetic process of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is very sluggish due to the four-electron proton coupling mechanism, which seriously affects the hydrogen production efficiency.

Directed self-assembled pathways of 3D rose-shaped PtNi@CeO2 electrocatalyst for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of high electrocatalytic activity and low-cost Pt-containing catalyst is highly feasible for hydrogen evolution reactions under alkaline conditions. In this study, a series of three-dimensional (3D) rose-shaped cerium (IV) oxide (CeO2)-supported Pt and Ni alloy nanocomposite catalysts were prepared by a direct solvothermal method (PtxNiy @CeO2), and the catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts in hydrogen evolution reactions was studied. The experimental results show that the rose-shaped CeO2 as a carrier can provide abundant oxygen vacancies, and when combined with Pt and Ni, it will trigger the rearrangement of metal electrons. At the same time, this special structure can provide a larger specific surface area and expose more active sites. Bimetallic catalysts have higher hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity than monometallic catalysts due to the interaction between metals. In the composite catalyst with a molar ratio of Pt to Ni of 1:1 (Pt1Ni1 @CeO2), electrons are transferred from Ni to Pt. At this time, the catalyst exhibits the most excellent HER catalytic performance. Exhibits low HER overpotential (59 mV) and Tafel slope (56.50 mV dec−1) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. In addition, the composite catalyst exhibits distinguished long-term electrochemical stability within 15 h.

Application of Ag-based materials in high-performance lithium metal anode: A review,"© 2022Li metal is a promising candidate for battery anodes due to its high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g−1) and low electrochemical potential (−3.04 V).

In addition, the relationship between their fabrication strategies, micro/nanostructures, and electrochemical performances is systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for the future research and application of Ag-based materials in lithium metal batteries are proposed based on the available academic knowledge.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology

This ascribes to the adjustable relaxation polarization, which plays a decisive role in microwave loss and the frequency modulation mechanisms. Besides the ideal regulation range of relaxation polarization for dielectric loss materials was confirmed (0.09–3.1) by conforming to the optimal impedance matching principle. In addition, the Sn/rGO and paraffin composite absorbers with reflection loss values of − 39.5 dB at 3 mm were obtained in X-band (5 wt%). The enhanced polarization loss and microwave absorptivity can be explained in terms of the intrinsic carrier concentration and the carrier migration. Overall, the hereby proposed strategy and theoretical analysis do provide a new perspective for designing absorbing devices in practical application.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Magnetron sputtering engineering of typha-like carbon nanofiber interlayer integrating brush filter and chemical adsorption for Li–S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdEnhancing the adsorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides is critical in improving the cycling stability of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. Herein, an ultralight typha-like carbon nanofiber (CNF) based interlayer (MoS2/Al2O3@CNF) is constructed by scalable electrospinning and eco-friendly magnetron sputtering, to act as a “police constable” between the cathode and separator. The co-sputtering of MoS2 and Al2O3 endows the interlayer with both chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion active sites. Besides, the typha-like nanofibrous interlayer serves as both membrane and brush filters, leading to more efficient polysulfide blocking. The structural superiority of this interlayer compared to the CNF membrane results in a 693.8% higher specific surface area of 254 m2 g−1. In addition to these benefits, the unique structure allows for a 6.9-fold increase in exposure of active sites. The cell with such an interlayer delivers stable long-term cycling performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.035% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 0.5C. The long-term cycling performance can be attribute to the structural stability of the typha-like nanofibrous membrane, as evidenced by the postmortem SEM images. This work provides a valuable strategy for designing functional interlayers toward the long-term cycling stable Li–S batteries.",Carbon
A multifunctional separator based on dilithium tetraaminophthalocyanine self-assembled on rGO with improved cathode and anode performance in Li–S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLi–S batteries are strong candidates for next-generation energy-storage applications. However, practical cells face critical challenges including the dissolution and shuttling of polysulfides on the cathode as well as the uncontrolled dendrite growth and degradation of the anode. Herein, we demonstrate a multifunctional separator based on dilithium tetraaminophthalocyanine (Li2TaPc) self-assembled on rGO that exhibits a comprehensive regulation effect on important ion transport properties to address the above issues in one configuration. Li2TaPc presents strong sulfiphilic/lithiophilic binding sites for the confinement of polysulfides within the cathode region to improve sulfur utilization. Charge transfers from the central cavity of the TaPc ligand to the rGO promotes the dissociation of Li+ cations to produce additional charge carriers. The negatively-charged TaPc ligand exhibits strong electrostatic repulsions to the salt anions and hinders their migration across the separator. The apparently increased Li+ transference number (0.41–0.89) suppresses dendrite formation and improves the reversibility of the Li anode. Meanwhile, the strong coordination effects of Li+ with Li2TaPc enable a high retention of Li + conductivity. The comprehensive functionalities of the separator result in significantly improved electrochemical performance of Li–S full cells. Pouch cells with a high areal sulfur loading and limited electrolyte addition are also demonstrated.",Carbon
Synthesis and application of single-atom catalysts in sulfur cathode for high-performance lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022Lithium–sulfur (Li-S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising energy storage devices because of their low cost, high energy density, and environmental friendliness. However, Li-S batteries suffer from sluggish reaction kinetics and serious “shuttle effect” of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), which causes rapid decay of battery capacity and prevent their practical application. To address these problems, introducing single-atom catalysts (SACs) is an effective method to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries, due to their high catalytic efficiency and definite active sites for LiPSs. In this paper, we summarized the latest developments in enhancing the electrochemical performance of cathode for Li-S batteries through introducing different SACs. Furthermore, we briefly introduced the catalytic mechanism of SACs and discussed the strategies of synthesizing SACs, including the spatial confinement strategy and the coordination design strategy. Finally, the challenges and prospects in this field are proposed. We believe that this review would help to design and fabricate high-performance Li-S batteries via introducing SACs and boost their practical application.",Chinese Chemical Letters

In this study, a series of bimetallic catalysts were synthesized by pyrolyzing a mixture of g-C3N4 and Fe, Co-tannic complex with various Fe/Co atomic ratios. The initial Fe/Co atomic ratio (3.5:0.5, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3) could regulate the electronic state, which effectively promoted the intrinsic electrocatalytic ORR activity. The alloy metal particles and metal-Nx sites presented on the catalyst surface. In addition, N-doped carbon interconnected network consisting of graphene-like and bamboo-like carbon nanotube structure derived from g-C3N4 provided more accessible active sites. The resultant Fe3Co1 catalyst calcined at 700 °C (Fe3Co1-700) exhibited high catalytic performance in neutral electrolyte with a half-wave potential of 0.661 V, exceeding that of the commercial Pt/C (0.6 V). As expected, the single chamber microbial fuel cell (SCMFC) with 1 mg/cm2 loading of Fe3Co1-700 catalyst as the cathode catalyst afforded a maximum power density of 1425 mW/m2, which was 10.5% higher than commercial Pt/C catalyst with the same loading (1290 mW/m2) and comparable to the Pt/C catalyst with 2.5 times higher loading ( 1430 mW/m2). Additionally, the Fe3Co1-700 also displayed better long-term stability over 1100 h than the Pt/C. This work provides an effective strategy for regulating the surface electronic state in the bimetallic electro-catalyst.",Environmental Research

However, the poor electrical conductivity and large volume change during lithiation/delithiation process, resulting in poor cycling stability, and seriously hindered the practical application in LIBs. Herein, a multiple Si/FexSiy@NC/CNTs composite is synthesized and investigated as advanced anode materials for LIBs via a simple one-step method. Such multiple Si/FexSiy@NC/CNTs composite has several merits including the FexSiy can not only accommodate the huge volume change of Si nanoparticles, but also enhance the conductivity upon discharge/charge process. Furthermore, the in-situ growth CNTs may help establish a long-range conductivity, and the Nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer can further improve the conductivity of Si, as well as inhibit the direct contract between electrolyte and Si during cycling process. Accordingly, the Si/FexSiy@NC/CNTs-1 exhibits excellent cycling stability (a high capacity of 994.4 mAh g−1 is maintained at 1.0 A g−1 after 600cycles) and outstanding rate capability (a suitable capacity of 441.7 mAh g−1 was obtained even at 5.0 A g−1). Moreover, the assembled full cell can achieve a capacity of 141.4 mAh g−1 after 65 cycles at 1.0C, exhibiting outstanding cycling stability.

Progress in metal-organic-framework-based single-atom catalysts for environmental remediation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In 2011, Zhang's research team discovered the first atomically dispersed Pt1/FeOx catalysts worldwide and proposed the concept of “single-atom catalysis”. The excellent atomic utilization rate of single-atom catalysts (SACs) in combination with their high specific catalytic activity makes them extremely appealing for environmental remediation. As research in this field has progressed, many methods of preparing SACs have emerged. However, strategies for the construction of high stability SACs with reasonable generality are still urgently needed to be developed. As metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) possess a well-defined structure and a high specific surface area, they can be considered viable and promising materials for the manufacture of SACs. MOF-based SACs can combine the advantages of SACs and MOFs, showing conspicuous performance in environment-related catalysis. In this review, we summarize the reported synthesis methods and explain how MOF-based SACs can be constructed according to their structural characteristics. We briefly examine accessibility characterization techniques for SACs. Additionally, several representative reports are presented on the successful preparation of MOF-based SACs for environmental remediation (mainly advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)). Finally, we conclude by suggesting several future development directions for MOF-based SACs.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews

Herein, ultrafine CoFe alloyed nanoparticles (NPs) homogeneously decorated on N-doped carbon nanosheets (CoFe@NCS) are synthesized by annealing the precursor of NCS supported CoFe-based Prussian-blue-analogues. The optimal CoFe@NCS delivers prominent electrocatalytic behaviors for both the ORR (0.88 V of half-wave potential) and OER (340 mV of overpotential at 10 mA cm−2) in an alkaline electrolyte. The outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activities are ascribed to the synergistic interplay of structural and compositional advantages, including the hierarchically porous structure as well as the strong coupling of ultrafine CoFe species and NCS. Simultaneously, the assembled flow ZAB with CoFe@NCS as the air-cathode catalyst manifests a superior battery performance to the device catalyzed by the noble-metal benchmark (Pt/C + RuO2).

Emerging catalytic materials for practical lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesHigh-energy lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have experienced relentless development over the past decade with discernible improvements in electrochemical performance. However, a scrutinization of the cell operation conditions reveals a huge gap between the demands for practical batteries and those in the literature. Low sulfur loading, a high electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio and excess anodes for lab-scale LSBs significantly offset their high-energy merit. To approach practical LSBs, high loading and lean electrolyte parameters are needed, which involve budding challenges of slow charge transfer, polysulfide precipitation and severe shuttle effects. To track these obstacles, the exploration of electrocatalysts to immobilize polysulfides and accelerate Li-S redox kinetics has been widely reported. Herein, this review aims to survey state-of-the-art catalytic materials for practical LSBs with emphasis on elucidating the correlation among catalyst design strategies, material structures and electrochemical performance. We also statistically evaluate the state-of-the-art catalyst-modified LSBs to identify the remaining discrepancy between the current advancements and the real-world requirements. In closing, we put forward our proposal for a catalytic material study to help realize practical LSBs.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

Science and engineering for non-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts to boost their ORR performance: A critical review,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal-air batteries (MABs) and fuel cells (FCs) critically rely on electrocatalytic O2 activation, and O2 reduction reaction (ORR), with noble metal-free materials. However, the inception of their synergist reactivity is still unclear due to several electronic and structural limitations. Therefore, the correlation between their science and engineering and their experimental as well as theoretical activity descriptors can pave the way for the development of novel cheap, and efficient catalysts. Moreover, with this framework, several volcanic correlations were established, indicating that catalyst activity increases linearly with increasing binding energy of ORR intermediates up to a certain point, but after that, the activity decreases as binding energy increases. The motivation of this review is to highlight (i) recent designs and developments on non-noble-metal-containing electrocatalysts for ORR, (ii) correlations between science and engineering and existing activity descriptors to improve the electrocatalyst's ORR performance, and (iii) prospects and challenges with non-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts.

Oxygen vacancies in open-hollow microcapsule enable accelerated kinetics for stable Li-S battery,"© 2022The fast development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is catching more attention to improve cycling stability and kinetics. Herein, a hierarchical porous Ni/NiO/C microsphere (NIONC) with openings assembled by ultrathin nanosheets is introduced to solve the poor conductivity, shuttle effect, and slow electrochemical kinetics of Li-S batteries. The structure of NIONC open-hollow microcapsules combines several advantageous properties for the improvement of electrochemical performances. Primarily, a well-developed hollow structure and openings can perform as containers and doors for sulfur immobilization. Therefore, the confinement effect to sulfur species is obtained by this hollow sphere.

"Mechanism exploration of highly conductive Ni-metal organic frameworks/reduced graphene oxide heterostructure for electrocatalytic degradation of paracetamol: Functions of metal sites, organic ligands, and rGO basement","© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The highly conductive Ni–metal–organic framework/reduced graphene oxide (Ni-MOG/rGO) heterostructure shows an excellent catalytic activity through the modification of active sites, considerably enabling the electron transfer between rGO and Ni-MOF. However, the detailed mechanisms, i.e., the functions of separate metal sites and organic ligands and electron transfer orientation between Ni-MOFs and rGO, remain to be discussed. Here, the electrocatalytic mechanism of Ni-MOF/rGO was experimentally analyzed on the basis of the density functional theory. The dominant active sites of radical and nonradical generation were determined. Findings indicated that radicals (O2•− and •OH) and nonradicals (1O2 and active chlorine) contributed to paracetamol (APAP) degradation. Moreover, metal sites (Ni) were favorable to generate O2•− and partly •OH to initiate the reaction. By contrast, organic frameworks in Ni-MOF and rGO basement favored to generate •OH and nonradicals (1O2 and active chlorine). In this case, N sites (in Ni-MOF), which seized electrons from Ni sites, acted as the primary bonding bridge to accelerate the electron transfer from rGO to Ni-MOF. This study provided essential information to decipher the mechanism of Ni-MOF/rGO heterostructure applicable to the electrocatalytic system.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
"MXene terminating groups [dbnd]O, –F or –OH, –F or [dbnd]O, –OH, –F, or [dbnd]O, –OH, –Cl?","© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesMXenes are a novel family of two-dimensional (2D) materials that are fast gaining popularity due to their versatile characteristics. The surfaces of these materials are often functionalized by negatively charged terminal groups, such as [dbnd]O, OH, and F during their synthesis, and it has been hypothesized that regulating the surface terminators enables to control the material characteristics. However, there is still a large gap between computational and experimental investigations regarding comprehending the surface functional groups. Surfaces with mixed terminations are consistently synthesized in experiments, although pure terminated surfaces are predicted by computational research. Here we summarized the nature of chemical bonding in transition metal carbide materials (MXenes) by 1H and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Raman, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)/scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TGA-MS) characterizations. Previous literature reveals that [dbnd]O, –OH, –F, and –Cl are typical MXene surface terminators. However, recent comparative investigations on the valence band intensity distribution in MXenes reveal that the –OH cannot be considered an intrinsic termination species in MXenes. The surface terminals ([dbnd]O, –OH, –F, and –Cl) of several MXenes, particularly V2CTx and Ti3C2Tx, will be identified and quantified here. We have also discussed different etching approaches for the synthesis of MXene, the dependence of MXene conductivity on MXene terminating groups, and the emission of various gaseous products that evolved during its chemical transformations.

Here, we firstly report the design of expanded graphite cohered by N, B bridge-doping carbon patches (NBEG) for efficient K-ion adsorption/diffusion and long-term durability. It is the B co-doping that plays a crucial role in maximizing doping-site utilization of N atoms, balancing the adsorption-diffusion kinetics, and promoting the charge transfer between NBEG and K ions. Especially, the robust lamellar structure, suitable interlayer distance, and rich active sites of the designed NBEG favor the rapid ion/electron transfer pathways and high K-ion storage capacity. Consequently, even at a low N, B doping concentration (4.36 at%, 2.07 at%), NBEG anode shows prominent electrochemical performance for KIBs, surpassing most of the advanced carbon-based anodes. Kinetic studies, density functional theory simulations, and in-situ Raman spectroscopy are further performed to reveal the K-ion storage mechanism and confirm the critical actions of co-doping B. This work offers the new methods for graphite-electrode design and the deeper insights into their energy storage mechanisms in KIBs.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

The diffusion of soluble discharge intermediate is the root cause of the above problems. Herein, we synthesized a porous organic framework material (HUT-8) based on triazine network, the polar groups above the hollow structure can not only adsorb LiPSs through electron donating effect, but also anchored cobalt (II) ions provide a large number of binding sites for the in-situ growth of CoS2. This ensured maximized exposure of catalytic centre and improve their interactions with sulfur redox species under the confinement of mesopores, which can catalytically accelerate capture/diffusion of LiPSs and precipitation/decomposition of Li2S. Based on the synergistic effect of the composite materials, the CoS2-HUT-8/S cathode maintained a capacity of 583 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 C, and a minimum capacity fading rate of 0.046% per cycle.

Herein, Co/N-carbon implanted Li+-montmorillonite (Co/N[sbnd]C@Li-MMT) is designed to inhibit PS shuttle and maximize PS redox kinetics in Li-S battery. The Co/N[sbnd]C@Li-MMT 2D nanomaterial is fabricated by exfoliation of the Li-MMT nanosheets using melamine and Co(II)(acac)2, followed by one-step thermal reduction. The exfoliated Co/N[sbnd]C@Li-MMT with high Li+ and electrical conductivity can expose abundant active sites for efficient PS adsorption via Co-S and Si-S and Li bonds and for fast PS electrocatalytic conversion via Co and Co[sbnd]N[sbnd]C catalytic active sites.

Facet-tunable coral-like Mo2C catalyst for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing efficient and stable transition metal-based electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media remains a great challenge due to slow water dissociation kinetics. Here, a novel coral-like porous nitrogen-doped Mo2C electrocatalyst (3D Mo2C) derived from ZIF-8 doped with phosphomolybdic acid hydrate (POM) was proposed for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction via facet regulation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations clarified that the Mo2C (0 0 2) facet accelerated water dissociation, while the Mo2C (1 0 1) facet more easily adsorbed H* to generate H2. Thus, Mo2C facets (1 0 1) and (0 0 2) with a suitable ratio showed synergistic effects to exhibit excellent alkaline HER performance. The coral-like porous Mo2C exposed sufficient active sites and facilitated electron and mass transfer to accelerate alkaline HER. The 3D Mo2C (1:1) catalyst exhibited excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 110 mV and a small Tafel slope of 73.9 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Towards an ultra-long lifespan Li-CO2: electron structure and charge transfer pathway regulation on hierarchical architecture,"© 2022Lithium-CO2 batteries are recognized as an essential strategy for efficient carbon sequestration and energy storage to achieve carbon neutrality. Their cycle-ability and polarization voltage, however, are hindered by high decomposition voltage (≈4.3–4.5 V) of insulating Li2CO3. Herein, we report a significant advance toward the rational design of self-supporting and ultra-long cycle lifetime cathode for Li-CO2 batteries, dependence on a favorable hierarchical architecture and rich charge transfer constructed by homogeneously distributed MnO2 nanoplates rooted in the MXene surface supported by carbon paper. Detailedly, it exhibits impressive ultra-long-term stability of 1087 cycles (4348 h) with a low polarization gap (≈ 0.47 V) at a high current of 200 μA cm−2, which is outperformed by all the liquid electrolyte-based Li-CO2 batteries reported previously. Electronic structure analysis reveals that facile charge transfer occurs between catalytic surface and Li2CO3, springing from the –OH functional group (in MXene) to MnO2 by –OH⋯O hydrogen bonds, which acts as charge transfer channels, improving the metallicity of Li2CO3 and facilitating its decomposition and extending battery cyclability.

CO2-derived free-standing carbon interlayer embedded with molecular catalysts for improving redox performance in Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The use of a free-standing carbon interlayer is a promising approach for the development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries because it suppresses the shuttle phenomenon and provides outstanding flexible characteristics. However, the thickness required to maintain the unique properties of the free-standing interlayer inevitably inhibits the transport of Li ions, causing sluggish redox kinetics. This work tackles the critical problem of the interlayer by synthesizing a composite in which Fe-based molecular catalysts are atomically incorporated into carbon nanofibers with superior pore characteristics realized by CO2 treatment. The templates self-generated during CO2 annealing provide high porosity and surface area, leading to effective Li-ion diffusion, and homogeneous distribution of the catalytic sites in the form of Fe-N2 to the free-standing paper. The Fe-N2 configuration thermodynamically aids in overcoming the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step of Li2S4 to Li2S conversion while minimizing the shuttle phenomenon. Based on the effective Li-ion transport by improved pore properties, and the superior redox reaction ability of Fe-N2, the assembled cell maintains a coulombic efficiency of 95% up to 1600 cycles at 3.0 C. In addition, a maximum areal capacity of 2.9 mAh cm−2 is delivered for a high loading electrode with 4.2 mg cm−2 at 45 °C.",Chemical Engineering Journal
A 3D multifunctional nitrogen-doped RGO-based aerogel with silver nanowires assisted self-supporting networks for enhanced electromagnetic wave absorption,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.We designed a promising three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide-based aerogel (NGA) with silver nanowires (Ag NWs) assisted self-supporting networks for enhanced electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption. 3D AgNWs@NGAs (8–12 mg/mL) were synthesized by a three-step strategy of sonication, reduction, and lyophilization. The results show that introduced sp3 defects and disordered sites in nitrogen doping from a rarely-reported liquid nitrogen source of acetonitrile remarkably improved electronic dipole polarization relaxation and EMW absorption ability. Besides, electronic band structure and density of states of the NGA were investigated by first-principles calculations to indicate that the carrier mobility became smaller during nitrogen doping. The Ag NWs were distributed on an NGA as the 3D network structure of an elastic support and a conductive and compatible unit, which limited the aggregation of NGA flakes, and further strengthened conductive loss. Significantly, the synthesized ultralight AgNWs@NGA exhibits excellent performance at 9.52 GHz, with a strong minimal reflection loss of –79.99 dB, a small thickness of 2.660 mm, a wide effective absorption bandwidth of 3.5 GHz, and an ultra-low filler content of 5 wt%. Furthermore, a large specific surface of 331.5 cm3/g, a good conductivity of approximately 50 S/cm, a high resilience, and an excellent heat insulation capability, guarantee the durable stability in EMW absorption of AgNWs@NGAs to resist distortion and heat attacks.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Simultaneous regulation of Li-ion intercalation and oxygen termination decoration on Ti3C2Tx MXene toward enhanced oxygen electrocatalysis for Li-O2 batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Active and robust bifunctional oxygen catalysts are the crucial factors to commercialize Li-O2 batteries (LOBs). However, most of the reported catalysts lack the competence to consistently achieve low overpotentials toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during long-term cycling under high rates. Here, the bifunctional activity of Ti3C2Tx MXene is subtly motivated by surface engineering via simultaneous regulation of Li-ion intercalation and O termination decoration. The post-treated Ti3C2Tx (t-Ti3C2Tx) MXene catalysts exhibit superior ORR/OER activities to the pristine Ti3C2Tx counterpart, where the conditions of alkalization by 3 M LiOH and annealing under 400 °C offer the optimum performance. The LOB using t-Ti3C2Tx achieves very low ORR/OER overpotentials of 0.16/0.57 V for discharge/charge process, and a large discharge capacity of 17627.3 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1, far outperforming that using the pristine Ti3C2Tx (0.19/0.66 V and 13119.7 mAh g−1, respectively). Remarkably, the t-Ti3C2Tx cell achieves unprecedented cycle performances for 300 cycles under the limited capacity of 500 mAh g−1 and 200 cycles under 1000 mAh g−1 at a high rate of 2000 mA g−1, meanwhile outputting the discharge voltages above 2.5 V throughout the whole cycles. The superb catalytic capability of t-Ti3C2Tx is mainly attributed to the synergistic contributions from the uniform O termination groups, abundant intercalated Li ions, expanded interlayer spacing and the consequent increase in active sites for facile formation and decomposition processes of Li2O2 discharge product, and the suppression of excessive oxidation of Ti surface atoms.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Nickel-cobalt Cyclo-tetraphosphate decorated hollow carbon nanocages as effective polysulfide promoters for stable Lithium-Sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promising next-generation energy storage systems. The construction of high-efficiency electrocatalysts to overcome the barriers of sluggish lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion and shuttle effect is urgent. Herein, nickel–cobalt cyclo-tetraphosphate (NiCoP4O12) nanoparticles embedded in hollow carbon polyhedrons are elaborately prepared and used as excellent polysulfide promoters in LSBs. The well-controlled core–shell structure physically blocks and strongly captures LiPSs, thereby boosting LiPSs conversion kinetics over the large exposed NiCoP4O12 active sites. Meanwhile, the carbon matrix build a conductive network that enables high-speed electron and ion transport, thus forming a rapid and robust “capture-diffusion-transformation” network. As a result, the assembled S@NiCoP4O12 cathode delivers an excellent rate capacity (518.7 mAh g−1 at 5 C), impressive stability (a small capacity decay of 0.0396 % per cycle over 1500 cycles at 1 C), and favorable durability of thick sulfur cathodes under lean electrolyte condition (with 4.13 mg cm−2 sulfur loading and 5.0 µL mg−1 electrolyte) over 120 cycles.",Chemical Engineering Journal
New electron transfer bridge construction between Ni3(HTTP)2 and graphene oxide layers for enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of tetracycline hydrochloride,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electron transfer capability as crucial properties of anode is directly related to electrocatalytic performance. However, the contributions of electron transfer were always under estimated due to the ambiguous mechanism of electrocatalysis. In this paper, a new electron transfer bridge was constructed in Ni3(HTTP)2/GO to provide a new insight into electrocatalytic performance enhancement. The contributions of active sites candidates, including metal sites, ligands (metal bridging atoms), and electron transfer bridges were innovatively separated. As replacement experimental results (of metal sites and metal bridging atoms), both metal sites and metal bridging atoms contributed slightly as the active center directly for the electrocatalytic degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH). The great improvement was attributed to the generation of “GO-C-O-S-C-Ni3(HTTP)2” bridges, in which S atoms from ligands were critical anchoring sites for the connection of two 2D layers (Ni3(HTTP)2 and GO layer). The experimental and density functional theory results showed Ni3(HTTP)2 could donate electrons to GO layers, leading the electrostatic imbalance of charge density to facilitate electron withdrawal from pollutions (not only TCH, but also dyes and complex microbial flora). The results of this paper provide a new strategy for improving electrocatalytic efficiency by adjusting electron transfer for novel practical applications of Ni3(HTTP)2/GO composites.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Graphitic carbon nitride engineered α-Fe2O3/rGO heterostructure for visible-light-driven photochemical oxidation of sulfamethoxazole,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Rational design of semiconductor photocatalysts is an effective way to achieve efficient visible-light-driven environmental remediation. Herein, a series of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) engineered hematite (Fe2O3)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) photocatalysts were synthesised and employed in visible-light-driven photo-Fenton-like degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The exceptional performance of the optimal photocatalyst (0.4-FerGCN-3) was achieved because of the successful structural integration of g-C3N4/Fe2O3/rGO for efficient separation and migration of photoinduced charge carriers (e−/h+). Photochemical decomposition efficiency was also optimised by analysing the important reaction parameters such as initial catalyst loading, initial H2O2 dosage, pH, and reaction temperature. Detailed studies on the generation of reactive species and degradation intermediates were performed to propose a possible mechanism for SMX degradation. The findings may provide not only a strategy for nanostructure engineering of semiconductor photocatalysts but also insights into the effective remediation of emerging contaminants such as SMX.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Methylene blue adsorption derived thermal insulating N, S-co-doped TiC/carbon hybrid aerogel for high-efficient absorption-dominant electromagnetic interference shielding","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of absorption-dominant electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with high-efficiency EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) and low reflection (R) is crucial but challenging for next-generation electronics devices and telecommunication. In this regard, a facile and environmentally friendly approach was proposed to fabricate N, S-co-doped TiC/carbon hybrid aerogels with hierarchically porous architecture through MXene/cellulose hybrid hydrogels as precursors for adsorbing dyes, followed by freeze drying and carbonization process. Profiting from the synergistic effect of highly interconnected three-dimensional (3D) porous structure, heterogeneous conductive network with greatly conductive difference as well as heteroatoms-doping induced dipole polarization, the resultant aerogel with an ultra-low density (47.1 mg/cm3) achieves a highly efficient EMI SE of 84.3 dB at 12.4 GHz (average 81.8 dB in the X-band) and a superior absorption coefficient of 0.68 simultaneously. Meanwhile, the highly porous structure endows the prepared aerogels with outstanding thermal insulating capacity, which is essential to provide infrared stealth and radar stealth for military equipment and to protect sensitive electronic devices from high-temperature attacks. This work offers a prospective strategy for constructing high-performance absorption-dominated EMI shielding materials with excellent thermal insulation properties, and the obtained aerogels present broad application prospects in the fields of aviation, portable electronic equipment and national defense industry.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Microenvironment engineering of Fe-single-atomic-site with nitrogen coordination anchored on carbon nanotubes for boosting oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline and acidic media,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing cost-effective and high-performance non-precious electrocatalysts for ORR in acidic and alkaline media is an urgent need for clean energy generation. A significant improvement in the ORR performance has been realized by the single-atom catalysts (SACs). However, activity deterioration caused by the dissolution of catalyst structure is still a lingering challenge. Herein, we report a simple strategy for protecting the structure of SAC by implanting/decorating Fe-ZIF-derived carbon nanotubes with Fe-N4, denoted as FeSA@CNTs. The as-developed FeSA@CNTs catalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR activity in an alkaline medium with onset potential (Eo) = 0.998 V and half-wave potential E1/2 = 0.898 V, which are 28 mV and 29 mV higher than commercial 20% Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, FeSA@CNTs in an acidic medium show an impressive high half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.8290 V) comparable to Pt/C (E1/2 = 0.8292 V) which is better than most recently reported ORR catalysts. The density functional theory (DFT) validates that the smaller difference in the energy orbitals of Fe in Fe-N4 and O2 improved the electron transfer onto the reaction intermediate (OH*) in the rate-determining step, which provides the higher catalytic activity for FeSA@CNTs' in both acidic and alkaline media.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Lamellar-structured anodes based on lithiophilic gradient enable dendrite-free lithium metal batteries with high capacity loading and fast-charging capability,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium (Li) metal batteries have attracted much attention due to extremely high energy density. However, safety concerns and limited lifetime associated with dendrite growth of Li anodes, especially at high capacity loadings and high rates, hamper their practical application. Here, we report the construction of lamellar-structured lithium host containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs), MXene nanosheets, and SnO2 nanoparticles via a simple step-by-step vacuum filtration method. The architecture is based on the lithiophilic gradient of each component, in which highly-lithiophilic SnO2 nanoparticles uniformly anchor on the lithiophilic MXene current collector, and lithiophobic CNTs act as the top protective layer. In this way, Li electrodeposition is spatially guided in a bottom-up mode free from dendrite growth. Consequently, the CNT/MXene/SnO2 scaffold accommodates a high capacity loading of 8 mAh cm−2 with only 4.6 % volume expansion. Furthermore, the Li@CNT/MXene/SnO2 electrode achieves fast-charging capability and long-term cycling stability in both symmetric cells (40 mA cm−2) and full cells (10C). This work demonstrates an efficient approach to construct dendrite-free anodes for durable and high-power lithium metal batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal

However, for balancing electrochemical performance, mechanical properties and safety issues, the development of high-performance electrodes and electrolytes is still a challenge in this field. Herein, a 3D nitrogen-doped carbonaceous foam (N[sbnd]C) was synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and the covering of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) dramatically increase its flexibility without decreasing the electrochemical performance. The complete quasi-solid-state LICs using N[sbnd]C/PVDF-HFP as anode, N[sbnd]C/activated carbon (AC)/PVDF-HFP as cathode and PVDF-HFP as the skeleton of gel electrolyte are fabricated and shows good cycle stability (72.2 % after 2000 cycles).

"Emerging electrocatalytic activities in transition metal selenides: synthesis, electronic modulation, and structure-performance correlations","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Engineering high-performance, stable, and scalable electrocatalysts that can meet clean energy demands and solve environmental problems are urgently needed. Despite having been developed only recently, transition metal selenides (TMSes) have emerged as rapidly growing electrocatalysts due to their tunable bandgap, atom environments, and electronic structures, as well as multiphase structures with different conductivities. On account of the lack of guiding reviews, this progress report summarizes the synthetic methods, modulation strategies, structure-performance correlations, and the corresponding emerging electrocatalytic activities of TMSes.

Overall, this cutting-edge and comprehensive review will offer multidisciplinary guidance on discussing the experimental and theoretical progress of TMSes and unveiling the current critical challenges for their future developments in electrocatalytic energy conversion systems.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Hierarchical aerogels with hollow Co3O4 nanoparticles and graphitized carbon vesicles embedded in multi-channel carbon nanofibers for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Low ionic diffusivity, sluggish charge transfer kinetics, and volume shrinkage/expansion during charging/discharging of transition metal oxides and conductive carrier materials seriously reduce capacity and damage cycle stability of electrodes. Herein, we demonstrate an in situ structural transformation strategy for fabricating hierarchical aerogels with hollow Co3O4 (H-Co3O4) nanoparticles embedded in multi-channel carbon nanofibers (MCNFs) by electrospinning polyacrylonitrile/polystyrene/metal organic framework mixtures, freeze-drying, carbonization and oxidation. The positive electrode prepared with MCNF@H-Co3O4 aerogel as the active material exhibits high specific capacity of 244.5 mA h g−1 (1600.6 F g−1) at 1 A g−1, and ultra-long cycle life of retaining 90.5 % of its initial specific capacity after 30,000 cycles at 20 A g−1. Furthermore, N and O co-doped hollow MCNF (NO-HMCNF) aerogels with hollow carbon vesicles embedded in the MCNFs are also prepared by acid-etching. The negative electrode prepared with the NO-HMCNF aerogel as the active material exhibits a high specific capacitance of 362.5 F g−1 at 0.3 A g−1, and retains 95.5 % of its initial specific capacitance after 30,000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The assembled MCNF@H-Co3O4//NO-HMCNF asymmetric supercapacitor provides a high energy density of 51.9 W h kg−1 (750.3 W kg−1) and retains 90.1 % of its initial specific capacity after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1.

"Regeneration of textile sludge into Cu8S5 decorated N, S self-doped interconnected porous carbon as an advanced bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The utilization of hazardous textile sludge as a precursor for energy production has broad practical application prospects for both sustainable economic and environmental development. Herein, a novel Cu8S5 decorated N, S self-doped interconnected porous carbon (Cu8S5/NSC) with abundant mass transfer channel is successfully designed through a direct pyrolysis strategy of textile sludge waste.

Anion dependency of spinel type cobalt catalysts for efficient overall water splitting in an acid medium,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing effective electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an important task in sustainable water splitting for manufacturing green hydrogen. In the present study, we report a bifunctional catalyst prepared with an easy and cost-effective synthesis method for designing a spinel-structured, cobalt-based, and carbon-supported electrocatalyst (Co3O4@rGO and Co3S4@rGO). X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that Co-O and Co-S bonds are formed at the edge between cations and anions in the Co3O4, Co3S4 on the surface of reduced graphene oxide, which can alter the electronic structure of electrocatalysts. Fabricated Co3S4@rGO nanostructure catalysts showed best catalytic activity toward HER (ƞ10: 151 mV) and OER (ƞ10: 350 mV) comparable to those of commercial Pt-C and IrO2, respectively. This showed a significant improvement of water splitting performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte as compared to Co3O4@rGO electrocatalyst, with an operating voltage of 1.82 V at a current density 10 mA cm−2.

TiO2-carbon porous nanostructures for immobilization and conversion of polysulfides,"© 2022Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are among the most promising series of next-generation high density energy storage systems. However, the problem of “shuttle effect” caused by dissolution and migration of polysulfide intermediates has severely inhibited their practical applications.

Interfacial modification to anomalously facilitate thermal transport through cathode-separator composite in lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Effective thermal management is the key to ensuring lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)’ lifetime and performance. However, the high thermal resistance across the cathode-separator interphase considerably limits the fast heat transfer. Adopting the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) approach, various organic molecules were selected as the heat controllers to modulate the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) between the cathode, lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), and the separator, polyethylene (PE). Silane-based SAMs molecules with different groups, including –NH2, –SH, and –CH3, were assembled into the LCO-PE composite's interphase. Through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, our results demonstrate SAMs molecules-decorated LCO-PE nanocomposites give a notably improved interfacial heat transfer but are of different magnitude. Such difference mainly results from the different non-bonded interactions and compatibility between SAMs molecules and PE. Of the three SAMs molecules, the assembled 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (APTMS) featuring –NH2 groups improves the ITC the most, about 303.29% in comparison with the pristine interface. Furthermore, these findings help elucidate the underlying mechanisms of how SAMs molecules improve heat transfer across the LCO-PE interphase. Specifically, such enhancement is greatly attributed to the unique SAMs molecules, which build the new heat transfer pathways between LCO and PE, straighten SAMs molecules’ morphology, remove the discontinuities in the temperature field, develop the strong non-bonded interactions between SAMs molecules and PE, and strengthen the coupling vibration of two materials. These investigations provide a new perspective for designing composite's interphase to mediate the heat transfer and achieve more effective thermal management across the interphase.",Applied Surface Science
Se and Fe co-doping in Ni2P/Ni12P5/NF: Highly active and ultra-long stability of the oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Hydrogen production by water splitting is a promising hydrogen production technology, but limited by the slow OER reaction kinetics, the development of high-performance OER catalysts is urgently needed. Herein, a three-step process of hydrothermal, electrodeposition and phosphorization was carried out to grow nanoparticulate Se, Fe-Ni2P/Ni12P5 on NF (Se, Fe-NiP/NF) in this work. The catalyst exhibits excellent OER electrocatalytic performance, requiring an overpotential of only 225 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA·cm−2 with a Tafel slope of only 33 mV · dec−1, and can maintain stability for more than 100 h under alkaline conditions. Remarkably, the surface of the nanoparticles after stability testing was rougher, exposing many very small nanoflakes thus exposing more active sites, which is responsible for its extremely long time stability. The results show that the co-doping of Se and Fe can effectively reduce the energy barrier of electrocatalytic reactions and improve the morphology, which provides a new approach to explore high-performance and corrosion-resistant electrocatalysts.",Applied Surface Science
Two-Dimensional metal-free compounds of BC4N and BC6N2 with boron atoms as highly efficient catalytic centers toward sulfur redox in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as ideal next-generation energy storage devices, the commercial applications of them are hindered by their inherent drawbacks of shuttle effect and sluggish conversion among lithium polysulfides (LiPs). To tackle these issues, significant research efforts have been devoted to designing high-performance metal-based catalysts implemented in the sulfur cathodes, which however face the challenges of source scarcity and cycling instability. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we investigated our previously predicted two-dimensional (2D) metal-free boron-containing catalysts of BC4N and BC6N2 and found that they possess strong trapping capability for LiPs adsorption energy as low as −6.41 eV beneficial for suppressing shuttle effect. Moreover, BC4N exhibits even superior catalytic performances toward the redox of sulfur, which can be evidenced by the low free energy change of the rate determining step of reduction reaction and small energy barrier of 0.80 eV for Li2S decomposition, outperforming most previously reported metal-based catalysts. Our research can pave a new way for designing new 2D metal-free catalysts in Li-S batteries, which highlights the importance of boron atoms in suppressing shuttle effect and catalyzing sulfur redox.",Applied Surface Science
The surface functional modification of Ti3C2Tx MXene by phosphorus doping and its application in quasi-solid state flexible supercapacitor,"© 2022The surface modification of MXene by heterogeneous atoms shows great potential in improving the charge storage capacity of MXene. Herein, a strategy of rapid in-situ phosphorus doping at low temperature is demonstrated for preparing functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ti3C2Tx-P) using sodium hypophosphate as phosphorus source. The phosphorus doping can increase the layer spacing of Ti3C2Tx and yield P[sbnd]O and P[sbnd]C bonds in Ti3C2Tx, resulting in more rapid paths for the migration of electrolyte ions into electrode and more active sites for pseudocapacitance effects. As flexible electrode of supercapacitor, the specific capacitance of Ti3C2Tx-P reaches as high as 476.9F g−1 (745.4F cm−3), which is far larger than that of the raw Ti3C2Tx (344.4F g−1, 438.5F cm−3). In addition, a flexible quasi-solid supercapacitor device assembled by Ti3C2Tx-P film shows high specific capacitance of 103F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. When the power density is 250 W kg−1 and 10000 W kg−1, the corresponding energy density reaches 15.8 Wh kg−1 and 6.1 Wh kg−1, respectively. Therefore, our work not only reveals the role of P atom doping in improving the structure, composition and electrochemical performance of Ti3C2Tx, but provides a method for surface modification and functionalization of MXene materials.",Applied Surface Science
Co and N co-doped hierarchical porous carbon as peroxymonosulfate activator for phenol degradation via nonradical pathway mechanism,"© 2022Developing catalysts with high metal utilization rates for activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) has attracted extensive attention. Herein, Co and N co-doped hierarchical porous carbon (Co/HOPNC) was synthesized successfully for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation to degrade phenol. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) confirmed that this hierarchical porous carbon indeed offered a site for the highly dispersed with low doping amount of Co. The 1.5 % Co/HOPNC exhibited the optimal removal efficiency and admirable adaptability to pH, temperature and different co-existing ions, which was credited to the highly dispersing Co atoms. Furthermore, the leaching of Co showed a neglectable impact on catalytic efficiency, revealing metal leaching was indeed inhibited. Remarkably, singlet oxygen (1O2) and high-valence Co-oxo species were verified as major contributors to enhance the catalytic activity. This finding gives a unique insight in PMS activation mechanism triggered nonradical pathways of hierarchical porous carbon materials. Moreover, the 1.5 % Co/HOPNC displayed an outstanding effect on phenol degradation in actual wastewater which expressed great potential in practical applications.",Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects
Effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant concentrations on the novel strontium copper oxide nanostructures for enriching hydrogen evolution reaction electrochemical activity in alkaline solution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Nowadays, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has gained more attention than the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water-splitting. The OER, which involves a four-electron process, is more complex whereas the HER, which involves a two-electron process, is more easy. Hydrogen is one of the promising and efficient energy carriers for renewable and sustainable energy yield. In this work, we have successfully prepared a low-cost electrocatalyst of strontium copper oxide (SCO) through a simple co-precipitation method, followed by an annealing process. The X-ray diffraction is consistent with an orthorhombic structure of SCO. The different modes of vibrations containing Cu, Sr, and O bonds were identified by using the Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectra. The scanning electron microscopy images confirmed that the introduction of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant allowed to control the size and morphology of the prepared material. Electrochemical measurements indicated that 2 wt% SDS-assisted SCO material exhibited excellent HER performance and high stability. It achieved 166 mV to deliver 10 mA/cm2 and attained the low 124 mV/dec Tafel slope value, indicating that hydrogen evolution reaction followed the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. Compared to the pure and 1 wt% SDS-SCO, 2 wt% SDS-SCO material exhibited a high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 19.3 cm2 and showed a low 0.33 Ω charge-transfer resistance, indicating the presence of supplementary active sites and enhanced electrical conductivity than the reference electrocatalysts. Hence, this work could be considered as a successful approach in exploring the performance of alkaline-based metal oxides in electrochemical hydrogen evolution reactions.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Three-dimensional SnCu scaffold with layered porous structure enable dendrite-free anode of lithium metal batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium metal anode with unparalleled theoretical specific capacity, ultra-low redox potential is a magic weapon to further enhance the energy density of the rechargeable batteries. Unfortunately, fragile solid electrolyte interphase, notorious dendritic growth and infinite volume expansion seriously hindered its commercialization process. Herein, a dendrite-free 3D SnCu scaffold is obtained by a simple, flexible replacement reaction. The porous SnCu with ordered layered structure can induce uniform Li deposition, suppress dendrites growth by reducing the local current density. What's more, the introduction of metal Sn enhance the lithiophilicity of Cu substrate, therefore decreasing the Li nucleation overpotential. Compared with planar Cu foil scaffold, the synthesized 3D SnCu current collector with dendrite-free morphology significantly improve the electrochemical performance of anode. The as-prepared SnCu scaffold obtains a highly Coulombic Efficiency of 94.2 % after 250 h in half-cells, and symmetrical Li@ 3D Sn/Cu cells exhibit stable cyclic for more than 1000 h at different current density (1and 5 mAh cm−2).",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
The generation of carbon/oxygen double defects in FeP/CoP-N-C enhanced by β particles for photic driving degradation of levofloxacin,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Carbon-based materials have been widely studied for their special electronic structure and excellent catalytic performance. In this work, polypyrrole carbon-based precursors were prepared by the polymerization of pyrrole and phytic acid with the high coordination ability of Fe and Co. Then, an FeP/CoP-N-C-X catalyst with a three-dimensional net][work structure was obtained by high-temperature calcination, which was used for the degradation of levofloxacin (LEV). The obtained results showed that FeP/CoP-N-C-700 could completely remove LEV within 40 min. XPS, Raman spectroscopy and EPR spectroscopy demonstrated the existence of a typical carbon/oxygen double-defect structure in FeP/CoP-N-C-700. XPS results shows that the percentage of oxygen defects in the O element of FeP/CoP-N-C-700 was 73.05 %. DFT calculation results shows that the d-band center of FeP/CoP-N-C-700 with carbon/oxygen double defect was −1.35 eV, while that of FeP/CoP-N-C-700 without carbon/oxygen double defect was −1.78 eV. These results indicates that the carbon/oxygen double defects could change the distribution of local electrons in FeP/CoP-N-C-700, which made it exhibit higher n-type conductivity and charge separation efficiency. After each five photocatalytic cycles, FeP/CoP-N-C-700 was treated by electron beam irradiation, and the removal rate of LEV increased from 81.2 % to 96.32 %. XPS, Raman spectroscopy and EPR spectroscopy demonstrate that carbon/oxygen double defects in FeP/CoP-N-C-700 can be regenerated by electron beam irradiation, which could greatly improve the service life of the catalyst. Furthermore, LC-MS results indicates that FeP/CoP-N-C-700 preferentially dissociates the piperazinyl group in levofloxacin and exhibits a single degradation pathway for it. This work not only provides a new idea for the regeneration of materials and the improvement of cycle performance, but also provides a new strategy for the application of electron beam irradiation in the field of photocatalysis.",Separation and Purification Technology
Spaced-confined heterostructure engineering enables rapid ion transport in MoS2–Co9S8@C yolk-shell polyhedron for efficient lithium storage,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The out-of-plane van der Waals interaction between stack molybdenum sulfide layers is not conducive to ion transport in Li-ion capacitors, resulting in the decreasing cycling and rate performance. To improve the ion transfer ability, it is an effective strategy to optimize interatomic forces by using refined architectures to construct interface atomic structure. Herein, a space confined molybdenum sulfide-cobalt sulfide heterostructure embed in carbon (MoS2–Co9S8@C) with yolk-shell polyheron morphology is reported via a sequential ion exchanging strategy. The refined heterostructure facilitates to build strong built-in electric field, enabling high ion transport efficiency in MoS2–Co9S8@C polyhedron anode. The space confined yolk-shell structure contributes to buffer the volume expansion effect.

Enhanced radical generation and utilization efficiency by interfacial enrichment and electronic regulation of CuMnO2/CeO2: Processes and mechanism,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.As a radical predominant reaction, how to enhance the generation and utilization efficiency of radical through interface regulation then to improve its catalytic activity has been the long-term goal to promote its practical application. Realized the redox carrier may play multifunctional roles in catalytic reaction, CeO2 supported CuMnO2 (CuMnO2/CeO2) was successful constructed and the catalytic performance, reaction process and the relevant mechanism were compared with its simple physical mixed form (CuMnO2 + CeO2). It was found that the introduction of CeO2 provided a large specific surface area to strengthen the enrichment of pollutants at the interface (10 % vs 5 % for ofloxacin and 32 % vs 27 % for tetracycline hydrochloride). In addition, the activated CeO2 support enhanced the interfacial electron transfer process and promoted the generation of more highly active Ce3+ in CuMnO2/CeO2. Their synergistic effects shortened the migration distance from the formed radicals to target pollutants, thus improving the generation and utilization efficiency of radicals. So, the ofloxacin degradation rate in CuMnO2/CeO2 catalytic system was 3.25 times higher than that in CuMnO2 system (0.091 min−1 vs 0.028 min−1). Moreover, the ion dissolution experiment further confirmed that the CuMnO2/CeO2 catalytic system can effectively reduce the ion dissolution, which was one of the most important parameters for practical application. Thus, this work proposes a strategy for developing high activity and environmentally friendly heterogeneous Fenton catalysts based on the principles of interface enrichment and electronic regulation.",Separation and Purification Technology
Heterostructured ZIF-67@α-MnO2 based nanofibrous membranes for highly effective removal of low-molecular-weight pollutants from wastewater,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, a thorn ball-like three-dimensional (3D) heterostructured ZIF-67@α-MnO2 catalyst consisting of ZIF-67 nanocages impaled by α-MnO2 nanorods were robustly embedded in polyacrylonitrile nanofibers by electrospinning technique for highly efficient removal of low-molecular-weight pollutants (LMWPs, like dyes and antibiotics) from wastewater. Benefiting from abundant active sites and enhanced charge transfer abilities provided by ZIF-67@α-MnO2 nanoparticles, the optimal ZIF-67@α-MnO2 nanofibrous membranes (NFMs) showed a significant response towards acid fuchsin (AF) in terms of comparable adsorption capacity (2495 mg/g) and impressive catalytic activity (degradation degree of 99 % AF within 20 min). In addition, the resultant membranes possessed satisfactory versatile catalytic activity toward tetracycline (95.3 %), norfloxacin (98.4 %) and doxycycline hyclate (89.2 %). Besides, the resultant membranes had high permeability of 1302 L·m−2·h−1 driven by gravity and could efficiently treat 370.5 L·m−2 AF (20 ppm), which was significantly higher than that of pure ZIF-67 NFMs (141.8 L·m−2). The successful fabricating of such membrane with extraordinary adsorption and catalytic performance provided a promising approach for high-performance catalytic membranes.",Separation and Purification Technology
Polyoxometalates-rich separator for fast polysulfide conversion kinetics and dense lithium deposition toward stable Li–S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium−sulfur batteries have great potential in the field of next-generation energy-storage devices owing to their high theoretical energy density. However, the polysulfide intermediates shuttling seriously result in fast capacity degradation and poor cycling stability, thus hindering their commercial applications. In this paper, we choose polyvinylidene fluoride containing polar functional groups in its polymeric chain as polymer carrier to construct the H3PW12O40 firmly and uniformly decorated nanofibers membrane by electrospinning technique. Benefiting from the feature of “electron sponges”, H3PW12O40 can act as polysulfide mediator to significantly facilitate the liquid-liquid reaction kinetics of polysulfides in the electrode/separator interface. Besides, fewer cracks, pulverization and adhesion of dead lithium particles occurred in the lithium metal anode, demostrating a more homogeneous Li-ion flux distribution after using this membrane with three-dimensional network structure and abundant redox active sites. The cell with such bifunctional separator delivers a specific capacity of 966 mAh g−1 at 1.0 C, and retained a capacity of 682 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles, corresponding to an average capacity loss of 0.09% per cycle.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
"Two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks: From synthesis to biomedical, environmental, and energy conversion applications","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (2D MOFs) are currently intelligent multifunctional nanostructure materials receiving accelerated attention for different applications in biomedical, environmental remediations, and energy conversion. This is due to their exceptional properties and advantages over conventional materials. They have appealing two-dimensionalities, crystallinity, connecting metal ions with organic linkers, ultrahigh surface areas, nanoscale structures, tunable cage/porous sizes, large surface-to-volume ratios, a larger number of active metal ion sites, flexible skeletons, proficiency in electron transports and transfer capability, and reasonable design strategies. Distinctly, the current study presents recent advances in the 2D MOFs for environmental remediations, energy conversion, and biomedical applications. It started with a comprehensive review of the synthesis strategies of the 2D materials, followed by the strategic modification approach for 2D MOFs for different applications. Unlike the available reviews in the field, the study includes detailed discussions in the biomedical (including biosensing, therapeutic delivery, bioimaging, biocatalysis, photodynamic therapy, biocompatibility, and toxicity), environmental remediations of pollutants (focusing on the various organic and inorganic pollutants remediations), and energy conversion (including nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), overall water splitting, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with the corresponding performance of 2D MOFs in these fields, fundamental concepts and mechanisms. The new engineering strategic protocols for accelerating the performance of 2D MOF materials for various applications and some insights into future research discussed in the present study were absent in the available literature. To bridge the knowledge gaps, some associated weaknesses and strengths, and the treatment strategies of the past studies were discussed. In addition, some vital outlooks and recommendations for advancing the 2D MOFs and the corresponding applications in biomedical, environmental remediations of organic and inorganic pollutants, NRR, CO2RR, OER, ORR, HER, and overall water splitting toward realistic industrial expectations were discussed. This review will help the scientific community to understand the research hotspot and the necessity for the fabrication of more viable novel 2D MOFs for clean energy, environmental, and biomedical security in a more eco-friendly approach to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions, global energy shortage, biomedical and environmental insecurity challenges.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Two-dimensional HfTe2 monolayer treated by dispersed single Pt atom for hazardous gas Detection: A First-principles study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing sensing materials with high response and selectivity to hazardous gases is crucial in industry, environmental area, and human life safety. In this work, the adsorption and sensing behavior of pristine and single Pt atom doped HfTe2 monolayer to six different hazardous gases (NO2, NO, CO, SO2, H2S, and NH3) were proposed theoretically. The adsorption configurations, adsorption energies, electron transfers, and the ratio of long-range interactions were compared. To discuss the response and desorption process, the work function, occupation function, and desorption time were investigated. It is found that, for pristine HfTe2, the ratio of long-range interactions is larger than 0.5 for most of hazardous gases except NO, but after the introduction of Pt, the adsorption energies increase while the ratio of long-range interactions decrease for all six hazardous gases. This phenomenon is ascribed to the conspicuous enhancement of the chemical and short-range interactions between adsorbed gas molecule and Pt atom. In addition, Pt-HfTe2 has high selectivity to CO at room temperature to about 400 K, and if CO is absent, Pt-HfTe2 shows high selectivity to NO2 at room temperature. The response of Pt-HfTe2 depends on the change of the work function. This study explored the theoretical sensing behavior of single Pt doped HfTe2 as work function-based gas sensor toward different molecules.",Applied Surface Science
A hierarchically porous TiN/N-C electrocatalyst with high interface utilization for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-Sulfur Batteries (LiSBs) are prevented to apply in practice by the irreversible loss from the cathode and difficult conversation kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). An ideal S host material should possess high conductivity and sufficiently dispersed catalytic active sites to precisely restore the dissolved LiPSs to the surface of the S host material. In traditional catalyst design, porous carbonaceous materials are often selected as carriers for the nano-catalytic activity sites. However, non-polar pure carbon interfaces, where without nano-catalytic activity sites covered, have a very weak affinity to LiPSs. Here, we use ammonia as a nitrogen source to anneal the reduced aerogel (graphene oxide (rGO) supported nano-TiO2) at high temperatures. The N element is atomically doped into the lattice of the carbon matrix, and the nano-TiO2 is converted to nano-TiN. A hierarchically porous and high conductivity TiN/N-C is prepared, in which the nano-TiN is well dispersed on the surface of N-doped rGO as an active center for catalyzing LiPSs conversion. The doped-N elements significantly increase the proportion of the polar surface. The S@TiN/N-C composite cathode delivered an excellent long-life cycling performance, and the reversible discharge specific capacity faded from 1224 ± 16 to 675 ± 31 mAh g−1 after 930 cycles. More importantly, after 150 cycles with a high S loading, a reversible areal capacity of 4.1 mAh cm−2 can be achieved.",Applied Surface Science
Advanced MOF-derived carbon-based non-noble metal oxygen electrocatalyst for next-generation rechargeable Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Zn-air batteries (ZABs) are considered as one of the most prospective green electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices due to their low-cost, high-energy density, environment friendly and satisfactory safety. However, the performance of ZABs is largely limited according to the activity of oxygen electrocatalysts. Precious metal Pt-based catalysts are often used together with Ru- or Ir-based catalysts for rechargeable ZABs. However, the high price and scarce resources limit their commercialized production. Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials have been considered as a valuable candidate for cathode material of ZAB due to their suitable price, unique porous crystal structure and adjustable chemical characteristics. However, the poor electrical conductivity and insufficient chemical stability severely limit their applications in electrocatalysis. In this work, the recent development of MOF-derived carbon-based non-noble metal carbon materials as cathode catalysts for rechargeable ZABs including morphology design, chemical composition and electrochemical performance is reviewed. The catalytic mechanism of MOF-based non-noble metal carbon materials is systematically summarized, and the main points determining the electrochemical performance of MOF-derived carbon-based non-noble metal electrocatalysts are discussed in detail. Promising strategies for improving bifunctional catalytic activity are then highlighted. Finally, the sustainability research, challenges and prospects of MOF-derived carbon-based non-noble metal materials used in ZABs are proposed.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Multi-enzyme activity nanozymes for biosensing and disease treatment,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In cells, multi-step biochemical reactions catalyzed by multi-enzyme biocatalysts are critical. While, multi-enzyme biocatalysts have evolved to catalyze these diverse reactions in biological systems. Based on this, multi-enzyme biocatalysts have tremendous potential in biocatalysis, bioassays, and therapeutic applications. However, the construction of multi-enzyme systems often suffer from intrinsic shortcomings, such as being time-consuming, complicated, and expensive. Recently, many nanomaterials have demonstrated multi-enzyme activity, among which multi-enzyme activity nanozymes are ideal candidates for multi-enzyme biocatalysts. Then, this review summarized the up-to-date research developments in the field of multi-enzyme activity nanozymes. We systematically introduced the detailed classification of multi-enzyme activity nanozymes based on the redox reaction, followed by a discussion of the possible catalytic mechanisms of the representative metal. In addition, we summarized several strategies employed to regulate the multi-enzyme activity of nanozymes as well as their potential applications in biosensing and disease treatment. Finally, the opportunities and challenges pertaining to these nanozymes are proposed. This review is expected to provide a paradigm for the design of nanozymes with multiple enzymatic and the regulation of their activities for biomedical applications.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Electrophoretic deposition of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheet N-carbon cloth as binder-free supercapacitor electrode material,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Despite the existing advances of Ti3C2Tx MXene as supercapacitor electrode material, its capacitance can be further enhanced through the composite strategy. In this work, the nitrogen-doped superhydrophilic carbon cloth (ENCC) was firstly prepared by N-doping of carbon cloth (CC), and then Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets were electrophoretically deposited to yield the binder-free Ti3C2Tx(EPD)/ENCC as supercapacitor electrode material. As a result, the composite electrode exhibited an area-specific capacitance of 2080.1 mF·cm−2 at 1 mA·cm−2 current density. The analysis implied that the varying Ti valence states provided certain psedocapacitance to the capacitance of the as-prepared electrode, though the main contribution was still dominantly from the electric double layer capacitance (EDLC). Further, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor yielded a wide voltage window of 1.8 V, and a good cyclic stability with 91% capacitance retention after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles at 20 mA·cm−2. Overall, the employed composite strategy enabled the good dispersion of the MXene flakes on the surface of the flexible substrate. Meanwhile, the large number of functional groups (-OH, -F, etc.) on the surface of Ti3C2Tx MXene interacted with the carbon layer through hydrogen bonding effects, which endows it as an ideal electrode for electrochemical capacitors.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Synergy of physical and chemical constraints for stable lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur battery is an appealing battery system, but it also suffers from the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) and an unstable cycling life. Physical constraints to polysulfide via coating and chemical constraints from Lewis Acid-Based catalysis are considered as two promising solutions to achieve improvements. Herein, we design a porous polypyrrole-coated cobalt-rich bimetallic oxide (CoFe2O4 @PPy) via a simple method. It endows the cathode with abundant pore structure and adsorption/catalytic sites (N/O and Fe/Co), which can alleviate the polysulfide shuttle phenomenon and protect from sulfur lost. Because of an important synergy between physical and chemical constraints applied to LiPS, CoFe2O4 @PPy/S composite cathode shows excellent performance with a low capacity decay rate of 0.035 % per cycle after 300 cycles at 1 C.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Abundant oxygen vacancies constructed by deep reduction strategy to achieve ultra-high peroxomonosulfate activation efficiency for degrading organic pollutions in water,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Herein, peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-like Fenton oxidation catalyst (DR-Vo-Co3O4) with rich oxygen vacancies and carved flower-like structures were constructed using Co3O4 as precursor via deep reduction strategy. DR-Vo-Co3O4 could activate PMS to achieve almost 100% degradation of sulfadiazine (SD) within 1 min with ultra-high efficiency, possessing a degradation rate constant (k) value as high as 5.9 ± 0.2 min−1, which was 86 and 5 times higher than the unreduced and reported maximum, respectively. Furthermore, the catalytic system showed unparalleled reactivity towards 14 different types of contaminants, with the maximum k value even exceeding 20 min−1. The carved flower-like structure of DR-Vo-Co3O4 catalysts not only facilitated PMS adsorption, but also provided more reaction sites for PMS activation. Meanwhile, rich oxygen vacancies could effectively tune the DR-Vo-Co3O4 surface electronic state to further accelerate charge transfer, significantly enhancing PMS oxidation efficiency. Catalytic mechanism analysis revealed that 1O2 and O2•− played a dominant role in contaminant degradation.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Isomorphic substitution of goethite by cobalt: Effects on the pathway and performance of peroxymonosulfate activation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Isomorphic substitution of Goethite (α-FeOOH) by metal elements with similar radii can greatly alter its physicochemical properties. Herein, a cobalt-substituted α-FeOOH (FeCox) was synthesized by simple coprecipitation on the atomic scale. The effect on the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) was explored using tetracycline (TC) as a model pollutant. Compared with the α-FeOOH, the performance of FeCo10 on PMS activation was greatly enhanced, and 95.4 % of TC was removed within 10 min. Cobalt substitution significantly decreased the metal ion leaching of the catalyst, and the iron and cobalt leaching of FeCo10 was only 4.023 and 33.614 μg/L. Co substitution altered the activation pathway of α-FeOOH for PMS. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and quenching experiments indicated that singlet oxygen (1O2) was the dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the reaction system. The activation of PMS was achieved by the process that PMS was first complexed with hydroxyls (–OH) on the surface of FeCo10, after which Fe and Co species in FeCo10 broke the peroxide bond. The reaction system could operate efficiently under different concentrations (2–250 mM) of Cl-, HCO3-, SO42- and NO3-. The excellent catalytic performance of FeCo10 was due to the structural defects caused by the introduction of Co, which significantly increased the –OH sites and electron transmission capacity of the catalyst. This work has proved that isomorphic substitution was an effective strategy for improving the PMS activation performance of α-FeOOH.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Single-walled carbon nanotube gutter layer supported ultrathin zwitterionic microporous polymer membrane for high-performance lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Development of efficient lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery requires the need to develop an appropriate functional separator that allows strong facilitation and transport of lithium ions together with limited passage of polysulfides. In this work, a multifunctional separator (TB-BAA/SWCNT/PP) is developed through spin coating of a novel zwitterionic microporous polymer (TB-BAA) on the gutter layer constructed from single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), where commercially available polypropylene (PP) separator is used to act as the mechanical support. SWCNT in this study serves as the first modification layer to decrease the size of the macropores in the PP separator, while the ultrathin TB-BAA top barrier layer with the presence of zwitterionic side chains allows the creation of confined ionic channels with both lithiophilic and sulfophilic groups. Due to the presence of available chemical interactions with lithium polysulfides, selective ion transport can be foreseen through such separator. In this regard, shuttle effect that is frequently encountered in Li-S battery can be suppressed effectively via implementing the as-obtained functional separator, resulting in the creation of credible and stable sulfur electrochemistry. The TB-BAA/SWCNT/PP-based Li-S battery has been investigated to possess high cycling ability (capacity fading per cycle of 0.055% over 500 cycles at 1 C) together with decent rate capability (736.6 mAh g−1 at 3 C). In addition, a high areal capacity retention of 5.03 mAh cm−2 after 50 cycles can be also obtained under raised sulfur loading (5.4 mg cm−2).",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Tunable MOFs derivatives for stable and fast sulfur electrodes in Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The commercialization of Li-S batteries is hampered by the poor conductivity of sulfur species, shuttle effects, and sluggish reaction kinetics. Due to their high porosity and specific surface area, abundantly exposed active sites, and interactive conductive networks, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) derivatives have been used as efficient sulfur adsorbents and reaction promoters. Herein, this review clarifies the clear correlation between MOFs derivatives and advanced sulfur electrode to precisely guide the functional design of MOFs derivatives for stable and fast sulfur electrodes. First, the reaction mechanism, challenges, and design principles of sulfur electrodes in Li-S batteries are briefly summarized. Meanwhile, the significance of MOFs derivatives in advanced sulfur electrodes is emphasized. Second, the characteristics of MOFs derivatives are highlighted. On this basis, a bridge between problem-feature-function is proposed. Specifically, MOFs derivatives with morphology modulation, structural engineering, various composition regulation, and the corresponding electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries are highlighted, respectively. Finally, a perspective on the future development of MOFs derivatives for stable and fast sulfur electrodes are given.

Bifunctional copper-cobalt spinel electrocatalysts for efficient tandem-like nitrate reduction to ammonia,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3−, NO3RR) provides an effective strategy to mitigate water pollution of human-caused but obtain high-value ammonia (NH3) under environmental conditions based on renewable energy. In this study, we prepared porous carbon nanofibers (CFs)-supported CuCo2O4 composite (CuCo2O4/CFs) electrocatalyst by electrospun-pyrolysis method for efficient conversion of NO3− to NH3. The experimental results revealed that the CFs could contribute to charge transfer and inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which preferentially catalyzes NO3−-to-NO2−. On the other hand, internally confined CuCo2O4 nanoparticles conduce to stabilize adsorbed nitrite intermediate (*NO2) for further conversion to NH3. The CuCo2O4/CFs exhibit the maximum NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 81.9 % at − 0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE) with a yield rate of 394.5 mmol h−1 g−1 at ambient conditions. The theoretical analysis demonstrated that the *NH3 desorption is a potential rate-determining step (RDS) with an uphill energy change of 0.76 eV over CuCo2O4. Furthermore, CuCo2O4/CFs as difunctional catalysts, coupling NO3− reduction with methanol oxidation (NO3RR||MOR) to substitute water splitting simultaneously at a low voltage. This work provides a strategy for combining NH3 electrosynthesis with methanol oxidation to high value-added chemicals under ambient conditions.",Chemical Engineering Journal
An integrated strategy for upgrading Li-CO2 batteries: Redox mediator and separator modification,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In Li-CO2 battery, redox mediators (RMs) are considered to have bright prospects due to their advantages of optimizing the mediated reaction pathway and reducing over-potential. However, some inherent defects caused by RMs, such as induced Li anode degradation and electron shuttle, limit its application in Li-CO2 battery. In this work, ruthenium acetylacetonate (Ru(acac)3) was innovatively applied as an efficient RM to boost the performance of Li-CO2 battery, and the “shuttle effect” of Ru(acac)3 to Li anode was also confirmed. To avoid the anode degradation caused by “shuttle effect” of RM, a novel Zn-MOF nanoplate modified glass fiber (M-GF) separator is skillfully prepared and used as a dual-function separator for Li-CO2 battery. Experiments coupled with density functional theory simulations verifies that M-GF can protect Li anode by preventing Ru(acac)3 from entering Li anode by physical and chemical interactions. Moreover, the highly ordered micropores in Zn-MOF also induce uniform deposition of Li+ on the Li anode to delay the degradation process of anode, and thus prolonged the cycle life of the battery. Thanks to the bidirectional support of Ru(acac)3 and M-GF strategy, the electrochemical performances of the Li-CO2 battery, especially the round-trip efficiency and cycle life, has been greatly improved.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Synergistic construction of bifunctional interface film on anode via a novel hybrid additive for enhanced alkaline Al-air battery performance,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Aluminum-air battery is considered to be a hopeful source of clean energy. However, the serious self-corrosion of Al anode hinders its commercial application. Herein, we propose an original hybrid additive consisting of 4-amino-6-hydroxy-2-mercaptopyrimidine (AHMP) and zinc oxide (ZnO) to inhibit self-corrosion of Al-6061 in alkaline Al-air battery. It induces a dense bifunctional film formed on the anode. The anode utilization rate reaches 60%, and the mass capacity of full cell increases from 879 mAh g−1 (blank) to 1785 mAh g−1 (with the hybrid additive). Surprisingly, this film simultaneously functions to activate the anode, boosting the discharge voltage of full cell. Experiments and theoretical calculations jointly reveal the mechanism formation of this unique bifunctional interface film: “site-directed bridging” of double metals (Al, Zn) to distinct adsorption sites on AHMP molecules. Our work investigates the origin of the synergistic effect for hybrid additives and provides a new strategy for screening functionalized additives to construct characteristic aluminum/electrolyte interface film for Al-air battery.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Surface energetics of graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide determined by inverse gas chromatographic technique at infinite dilution at room temperature,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Graphene is of great interest for many far-reaching applications that involve interparticle interactions in adsorbents, coatings, and composites. A deep understanding of the surface components has been crucial but achieving the most accurate and reliable values of these, unaffected by experimental conditions or the analytical techniques used, remains a major challenge. To this end, we have proposed in this paper a novel approach for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, to determine London dispersive and specific (polar) components including the Lewis acid-base character of the surface free energy of graphene materials (graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and graphite) using inverse gas chromatography (IGC) technique at an infinite dilution. We have estimated the London dispersive surface energy values of graphite, GO, and rGO as van der Waals interaction to be 156–179, 89–106, and 110–119 mJ m−2, respectively, in the temperature range of 320–360 K. These are attributable to the surface properties impacted by the oxygen moieties, defects, and micropores on the carbon frameworks. Further, the acceptor (KA) and donor (KD) parameters of GO were found to be 0.71 and 0.96, respectively, while those of rGO were 0.54 and 1.05. Notably, the GO is more of the Lewis acid character that could be amphoteric, while the Lewis base characteristics of both GO and rGO are not significantly changed. These results provide foundational knowledge to understand the physicochemical properties of graphene surfaces, which should be helpful to designing interface engineering in various applications.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Here, the multi-functional nanocomposite involving Co-doped molybdenum phosphide (Co-MoP) nanofibers and porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) is designed and prepared through electro-blow spinning and phosphating process, which possesses multiple adsorption and catalytic sites and is acted as the functional material for LSBs separators. In this multifunctional nanocomposite, the prepared Co-MoP nanofibers can provide internal adsorption and catalytic sites for LiPSs conversion. And the interconnected nitrogen-doped PCNFs can be elaborated an efficient LiPSs mediator and accommodate the huge volume changes in the reaction process for LSBs. Benefiting from the multiple adsorptive and catalytic sites of the developed functional materials, the assembled LSBs with a Co-MoP/PCNFs modified separator display outstanding electrochemical performances, including an admirable capacity retention of 770.4 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles at 1.0 C, only 0.08 % capacity decay per cycle at 2.0 C, rate performance up to 5 C, and also decent areal capacity even under a high sulfur loading of 4.9 mg cm−2.

We employed poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN) as a self-sacrificial template to fabricate hollow nanofibers by coaxial electrospinning and pyrolysis. Furthermore, macroporous interconnected hollow carbon nanofibers were achieved by fine-tuning the particle size of ZIF-8 and electrospinning parameters. Remarkably, as a proof-of-concept application, the Co/Co3O4-Ni/NiO decorated self-standing macroporous interconnected hollow carbon nanofibers (MHCNFs) electrodes exhibited significantly electrochemical performance, including a long-term cyclability (163 cycles) and maximum capacity (16623 mAh/g).

Herein, we report an elaborate heterostructure (Ti3C2/CPNC), composed of Ti3C2 nanosheets-encapsulated CoP nanocages with abundant lithiophilic/sulfiphilic sites for suppressing polysulfide shuttling and dendritic growth in Li-S batteries. Functioning as a separator mediator, the Ti3C2/CPNC heterostructure affords a synergistic effect of strong chemical interactions and fast conversion kinetics toward LiPSs. A half cell with the Ti3C2/CPNC interlayer exhibits a remarkable cycling stability with a capacity decay of only 0.039 % per cycle at 1C after 1150 cycles.

Lean-electrolyte lithium-sulfur batteries: Recent advances in the design of cell components,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have attracted considerable attention as next-generation secondary battery due to their significantly higher theoretical energy density (2,600 Wh kg−1) compared to that of commercialized lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In the last decade, most of the achievements in LSBs were attained based on excessive electrolyte usage. However, high electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S ratio) conditions degrade not only cost competitiveness but also actual energy density, eventually hindering the commercialization of LSBs. Therefore, it is essential to develop lean-electrolyte LSBs exhibiting excellent performance with advanced components even under harsh internal environments. In this perspective, this review focuses on the state-of-the-art advances of LSBs under lean electrolyte conditions and categorizes imperative strategies to overcome its serious problems.",Chemical Engineering Journal
FeCo/Fe3C-cross-linked N-doped carbon via synergistic confinement and efficient catalyst to enable high-performance Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSB) with high specific energy capacity and low material costs promise to be the next generation of energy storage devices. However, their commercialization is holding back by the poor cycling stability and fast capacity fading resulting from the shuttle effect and slow redox reaction. In this work, the FeCo/Fe3C-CNC composite was prepared by anchoring FeCo/Fe3C nanoparticles onto the crosslinked N-doped Carbon (CNC). The results showed that the addition of Co element improved the electrochemical activity of Co-Fe alloy through tuning the electronic structure of Fe atoms. The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown around Co-Fe alloy and Fe3C nanoparticles exhibited a strong affinity to polysulfide species and superior catalytic capability as nano-reactors. The N-doping CNTs/carbon sheets (CS) facilitated the formation of Li2S compound by promoting the Li+ ions transport while hindering the polysulfide shuttle effect. Hence, the issues of slow redox reactions and loss of polysulfide species were effectively rectified. As a result, the composite cathode FeCo/Fe3C-CNC-based LSB delivered a good specific capacity of 1401 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, and a low apacity fading rate of 0.029% per cycle at 1C. Besides, the structural stability of the FeCo/Fe3C-CNC composite confirms its potential for the deployment in LSB applications.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
A functional additive to in-situ construct stable cathode and anode interfaces for all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.All-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries (ALSBs) using poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based composite solid-state electrolytes (CSEs) are regarded as one of potential high energy storage devices; however, they still face two core problems of polysulfide shuttle and lithium dendrite during long cycle. Herein, based on a passive-type strategy, magnesium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide [Mg(TFSI)2] as a novel functional additive of the PEO-Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (PEO-LLZTO)-based CSE, has been proved to be successful on both retarding polysulfide species shuttle and stabilizing lithium anode. Study results show that magnesium polysulfide precipitate, formed on the interface between the S/C cathode and CSE, can hinder the shuttle of diffluent lithium polysulfide; and meanwhile, a robust LixMg layer generated on the surface of lithium anode can suppress the formation of dendrite. As a consequence, the Mg(TFSI)2 additive-functionalized PEO-LLZTO CSE obviously prompts a critical current density up to 1.0 mA cm−2 from 0.6 mA cm−2 of the sole PEO-LLZTO CSE, and maintains very stable cycling over 500 h at 0.2 mA cm−2 for a symmetric cell. Furthermore, the ALSB with the Mg(TFSI)2 additive-functionalized PEO-LLZTO CSE delivers robust cycle performances, with specific capacities of 877 mAh g−1 at 0.1C (1C = 1675 mA g−1) after 50 cycles (capacity retention ratio of 100 %) and 331 mAh g−1 at 0.5C over 300 cycles (capacity retention ratio of 94.1 %) under 50 °C. This work provides a realistic reference in designing novel additives to ameliorate the electrode–electrolyte interfaces for stabilizing ALSB.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Porous and heterostructured molybdenum-based phosphide and oxide nanobelts assisted by the structural engineering to enhance polysulfide anchoring and conversion for lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022Lithium-sulfur batteries have ultra-high theoretical energy densities, which make them one of the most promising next-generation energy storage systems. However, it is still difficult to achieve large-scale commercialization because of fast capacity fade and poor rate capabilities. These problems are mainly caused by the severe shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) and slow redox kinetics. To solve these barriers, herein a modification strategy of functional separator is prepared by coating heterostructured and defective MoP-MoO2 with porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) on the surface of a commercial separator. Moreover, for the first time, we detailly explored the formation processes of various heterojunction (MoP-MoO2, Mo3P-MoO2 and MoP-Mo3P) derived from MoO3 nanobelts and put forward some conceptions for the constituting heterostructured MoP-MoO2 through the phosphorization of MoO3 precursor. The functional coating layer exhibits both satisfactory interception ability for LiPS shuttle and fast LiPS conversion ability due to abundant anchoring sites of heterostructured MoP-MoO2 nanobelts and shortened lithium ion channels of the prepared PCNFs. Benefiting from these advantages, the assembled Li-S battery with MoP-MoO2/PCNFs separator delivered a high specific capacity of 1078.9 mAh g−1 at 1C and 1056.7 mAh g−1 at 2C, excellent cycling stability (856.9 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles at 1C and 630.1 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 2C). The cell with MoP-MoO2/PCNFs separator manifested outstanding cycle performance with fading rate of 0.08 % at 0.5C after 300 cycles under a sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm−2. The novel work will provide a new strategy by which the modified separator with the heterostructured transition metal phosphides and oxides can be applied for high-performance Li–S batteries and shows great potential for practical application.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Dilithium phthalocyanine as electrolyte additive for the regulation of ion solvation and transport towards dendrite-free Li metal anodes,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The application of Li metal anodes in high energy–density batteries is hindered by the uncontrolled dendrite growth and rapid capacity fading. Herein, we demonstrate that dilithium phthalocyanine (Li2Pc) is highly effective for the regulation of ion solvation and transport towards dendrite-free Li metal anodes. The strong interactions of Li2Pc with the solvents generate an apparent solvation sheath surrounding the large phthalocyanine ligand, where the dipole–dipole interactions of the solvents are weakened. This promotes the anion solvation in the outer solvation sheath, which suppresses the mobility of the anions for apparently increased Li+ transference number and facilitates the dissociation of the solute for a higher ionic conductivity. The resulting uniform Li+ flux alleviates the space charge to impede the growth of dendrites. Stable Li plating/stripping of 800 h (1 mA cm−2, 1 mAh cm−2) and dendrite-free Li deposition up to 10 mA cm−2, 10 mAh cm−2 are achieved in Li/Li cells and the Li/Cu cells exhibit a high average CE of 98.3% over 150 cycles at 1 mA cm−2, 1 mAh cm−2. Stable cycling of Li-S full cells at the condition of N:P = 2:1 are also demonstrated with high average CEs of 98.29%.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Interfacial microenvironment-regulated cascade charge transport in Co6Mo6C2-MoO2-CoNC@ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst for efficient hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.High-quality interfacial coupling can effectively boost photogenerated charge separation/transfer efficiency. Herein, we develop a multicomponent photocatalyst, Co6Mo6C2-MoO2-CoNC@ZnIn2S4 (CMN@Z), featuring directional and swift carrier transfer ability through interfacial microenvironment modulation. The distinctive CMN@Z displays a ten-times enhanced photocatalytic H2-production performance of 4728 μmol·g−1·h−1 than pure ZIS, accompanied by optimized apparent quantum efficiency of 25.06 % at 420 nm. Typically, the well-tuned Schottky barrier readily balances its bifunctionality in rectifying effect and powerful photogenerated electron extraction impetus. Moreover, the gradient work function variation enables the interfacial potential as a robust driving force to expedite charge transfer. Therefore, the resulting cascade charge channel and intimate interfacial contact endow CMN@Z photocatalyst with optimized H2-production performance by virtue of high-efficiency carrier spatial separation and utilization. Our work deeply explores the role of multiple interfacial in coupling photocatalytic systems, which offers new insight into the rational design of cascade photocatalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Cooperative catalytic Mo-S-Co heterojunctions with sulfur vacancies for kinetically boosted lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The intelligent design of catalytic materials with unique architectures has a significant impact on regulating the polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion and boosting the performance of Li − S batteries. Here, starting from 2D catalytic MoS2 nanosheets and combined with the first-principle calculations, the covalent heterojunction and S vacancy are simultaneously developed in MoS2 to regulate the electronic structure and improve the LiPSs conversion kinetics. The S vacancy and heterojunction (MoS2-x-Co9S8-y) engineering can significantly improve the electrical conductivity of MoS2 by incorporating shallow donor levels into the MoS2. Moreover, the incorporation of Co9S8-y greatly improves the chemisorption ability of heterostructure towards LiPSs. The LiPSs are preferentially adsorbed at the catalytic Mo-S-Co heterojunction, where both Li+ and e- are easy to access. The coupled fast Li+/e- transportation of MoS2-x-Co9S8-y enables direct and fast LiPSs “adsorption-conversion” at the catalytic Mo-S-Co heterojunction with enhanced bidirectional catalytic properties. Due to the ingenious co-engineering of S vacancy and heterointerface, the Li − S cell with MoS2-x-Co9S8-y/rGO interlayer delivers high sulfur utilization (1382.5 mAh/g at 0.1C), excellent rate capability (710.2 mAh/g at 3C), and long cycle life over 600 cycles (0.06 % capacity decay per cycle). This work demonstrates the great potential of anion deficiency and heterojunction co-construction for high-performance Li − S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Mn-doped FeS with larger lattice spacing as advance anode for sodium ion half/full battery,"© 2022Owing to their high theoretical capacity, transition metal sulfides are appearing as reliable electrode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), but achieving both high capacity and enduring cyclic stability remain a serious challenge. Here, multi-core Mn-doped FeS/NC was synthesized by one-pot solvothermal and annealing process. Larger lattice spacing, inducing by doping Mn-atoms, provides more space to store sodium ions. The doping of Mn-atoms increases the conductivity, enhancing the transport of charge carrier and rate performance. Multi-core structure and attached carbon can improve tolerance of volume expansion, which is beneficial to the long-term cyclic performance. In addition, it is also proved by density functional theory (DFT) that Mn-doping FeS can enhance the conductivity and lattice spacing. As a result, Mn-doped FeS/NC delivers high reversible capacity (563.3 mAh·g−1 at 0.5 A·g−1), excellent rate capability (442.8 mAh·g−1 at 8 A·g−1) and enduring cyclic stability (206.2 mAh·g−1 after 8000 cycles) as an anode for SIBs. Specially, a cathode of Na3V2(PO4)3/C is paired with the anode of Mn-doped FeS/NC to assembled into a full battery, showing a highly energy density (281.4 Wh·kg−1 at a power density 625.3 W·kg−1) and capacity retention rate. The present work provide a promise strategy to improve electrochemical performance of the monometallic sulfide.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Sulfur-doped unsaturated Ni-N3 coordination for efficient electroreduction of CO2,"© 2022Tuning coordination environment of metal atoms in catalysts can improve intrinsic performance of CO2 reduction and accelerate kinetics of CO formation. However, constructing unsaturated coordination configuration of metal single-atom by heteroatom doping still remains a challenge. Herein, a novel electrocatalyst of S/N co-coordinated Ni single-atom (denoted as Ni-SNC) was synthesized by calcining SO42- doped Zn/Ni ZIF for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The existence of single-atom Ni was verified by HAADF-STEM, while formation of “unsaturated” Ni-N3-S active sites was confirmed by XANES and EXAFS. The energy barrier of pivotal steps in CO2RR reaction process was reduced on “unsaturated” Ni-N3-S active sites, and sulfur doping improved current density of electrocatalytic process. The energy barrier of CO2→COOH* over Ni-SNC catalyst was only +0.69 eV, which was much less than that (+2.02 eV) over Ni-NC catalyst. The Ni-SNC exhibited CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of >90% at -0.6 ∼ -0.9 V vs. RHE with the highest FECO of 95% at −0.8 V.",Chemical Engineering Journal
A novel insight into deterioration of heavily sulfur-loaded cathode in Li-S battery,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdActive-substance (S8 and Li2S) deposition layer formed on polar interfaces is more reactive than that formed on apolar interfaces. However, when deposition layer reaches a certain thickness, by-path active-substance deposition takes place because of polysulfide disproportionation, which aggravates active-substance segregation to decrease the reactivity. This leads to a significant capacity decay and failure to accomplish polysulfide delithiation after certain cycles, which is understood as the results of decreased active-substance utilization and formed local micro-short-circuits, respectively. The finding of correlation between active-substance segregation and cathode deterioration inspires the design of polytetrafluoroethylene-based self-supported cathode to suppress active-substance segregation through avoiding increase of interphase contact resistance during cycling. With S-loading of 4.0 mg cm−2, the as-prepared cathode demonstrates excellent cycleability, retaining a capacity of 300 mAh g−1 at a rate of 2C after 1000 cycles. When increasing S-loading up to 36.5 mg cm−2, the as-obtained cathode delivers an ultra-high areal capacity of 24.6 mAh cm−2 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. However, increasing S-loading aggravates Li2S segregation which then narrows down Li+ transportation, leading to formation and growth of Li-shunts which in turn stimulates active-substance segregation. Such an inductive interaction between Li-shunt growth and active-substance segregation results in the fast formation of local micro-short-circuits, causing the constant supply of Li from Li shunts to cathode, and eventually accelerating cathode deterioration.",Electrochimica Acta
A novel electrochemical sensor for simultaneous detection of Cd2+ and Pb2+ by MXene aerogel-CuO/carbon cloth flexible electrode based on oxygen vacancy and bismuth film,"© 2022Herein, a novel MXene aerogel-CuO/carbon cloth (MXA-CuO/CC) electrochemical sensor was constructed, and the synergistic adsorption of heavy metal ions by oxygen vacancies and Bi (III) was investigated with Cd2+ and Pb2+ as detection targets. The oxygen vacancies of CuO have a strong affinity for heavy metal ions, which promoted the adsorption of Cd2+ and Pb2+ on the electrode surface. In addition, the introduced Bi (III) can form alloys with heavy metal ions, which effectively enhanced the adsorption capacity of sensing electrodes for Cd2+ and Pb2+. Differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) was used to study the performance of MXA-CuO/CC sensitive electrode for the detection of Cd2+ and Pb2+ separately and simultaneously. The constructed sensing electrode has excellent detection performance, and can detect Cd2+ (4 μg L−1– 800 μg L−1) and Pb2+ (4 μg L−1– 1200 μg L−1) simultaneously with detection limits of 0.3 μg L−1 (Cd2+) and 0.2 μg L−1 (Pb2+), respectively. The proposed sensor electrode also has good anti-interference performance, excellent stability and reproducibility. It is worth mentioning that the proposed method can accurately detect Cd2+ and Pb2+ in food and water samples, which is consistent with the detection results of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS).",Science of the Total Environment
N-doped hierarchically porous carbon based on MnO2 nanotubes as self-sacrificial reaction templates for supercapacitors and oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, N-doped hierarchically porous carbon (PDHC) has been prepared when MnO2 nanotube and polyaniline are selected as self-sacrificial reaction template and carbon source, respectively. Benefiting from the suitable N-doping degree inherited from polyaniline, and the hierarchical porous structure originated from the synergistic adjustment of self-sacrificial template and activation treatment, PDHC exhibits significant advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Typically, the PDHC has the high specific capacitance (467 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and rate performance (71.9% capacitance retention at 20 A g−1) in three-electrode systems. PDHC-based coin type symmetric supercapacitors are assembled with 1 M H2SO4 electrolytes and ionic liquid electrolytes, respectively, and they all exhibit a considerable synergistic power-energy output (752 W kg−1 at 31.1 Wh kg−1 and 750 W kg−1 at 74.8 Wh kg−1) and an acceptable cycling stability (6.5% and 13.9% loss over 5000 cycles). Meanwhile, the electrocatalytic performance of PDHC towards oxygen reduction reaction is also investigated, where a superior catalytic activity and a outstanding durability via 4e- pathway in the alkaline solution are confirmed, heralding the possibility of its practical application in fuel cells.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Assembly of MXene/ZnO heterojunction onto electrospun poly(arylene ether nitrile) fibrous membrane for favorable oil/water separation with high permeability and synergetic antifouling performance,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The two dimensional MXene nanosheets lamellar membranes have emerged as the promising candidates for oil/water separation. However, to deal with the large-scale discharge of complicated oily wastewater (including oils, organics, microorganism, etc), developing advanced membrane materials with high permeate flux and enhanced antifouling is still big challenge. Herein, the MXene/ZnO heterojunction was prepared by electrostatic attraction, which was modified by tannic acid (TA) and further self-assembled onto the poly (arylene ether nitrile) (PEN) fibrous mat to construct the multi-functional separation membrane (ZnO/M-TA@PEN fibrous composite membrane). In the hierarchical functional layer, the improved hydrophilicity of TA and the hierarchical micro-/nano-roughness build by ZnO NPs contributed to the super-hydrophilic/underwater super-oleophobic feature (WCA = 0°, UOCA>152°), leading to high separation efficiency and ultra-low oil adhesion. Uniquely, the decoration of ZnO NPs achieved the “intercalation effect” and effectively tuned the interlayer spacing between MXene nanosheets, which conquered the stacking problem of MXene nanosheets lamellar membrane and greatly enhanced the permeation flux of membrane. For separating various oil emulsions, the resulting ZnO/M-TA@PEN fibrous composite membrane displayed superior emulsion separation flux (1815.34 ± 44.73–2053.35 ± 42.62 L/m2·h) and separation efficiency (>99.4%), even in high-temperature and salty environments. More importantly, the heterojunction structure of MXene/ZnO hybrid endowed the fibrous composite membrane with enhanced antibacterial ability and photocatalytic self-cleaning performance toward the degradation of methylene blue, which realized the synergetic antifouling and favorable cycling ability of the fibrous composite membrane. This combination of anti-fouling and high permeability renders the membrane as attractive candidate for dealing with the oily wastewater containing multicomponent pollutants.",Journal of Membrane Science
In situ synthesis of MXene/Ag nanocomposites based flexible SERS substrates on PDMS for detection on fruit surfaces,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Pesticides are often overused in production and life, which harms the environment and human health. However, the current tools for detecting pesticides are not effective enough due to lower flexibility and stability. With regards to this, we synthesized a flexible substrate of PDMS modified by MXene (Ti3C2Tx)/Ag. The MXene-noble metal composite substrate can detect 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4MBA) at a low concentration of 1.0 × 10−11 M. Furthermore, MXene can inhibit the oxidation of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and efficiently localize the molecules to be tested within the hot spots. In particular, the flexibility of the substrate enables the detection of trace amounts of thiabendazole (TBZ) by collecting samples directly from uneven surfaces such as fruits and vegetables. The substrate is also capable of detecting a mixture of TBZ and 4MBA simultaneously. Using intrinsic Raman peak of PDMS as the internal standard can eliminate the influence of environmental factors on the detection results, which makes the detection results more quantitative. The resultant noble metal-semiconductor substrates show great potential applications in food safety and environmental monitoring fields.",Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects

Here, we found that in-situ generation of acidic species and Pd-Cl active sites bring high selectivity and activity towards hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived 5-(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF) to DMF. Gratifyingly, 92% DMF yield was achieved from CMF for 15 min, which indicates that space-time-yield is at least one order of magnitude higher than previous literature employed 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as substrate. Kinetic studies showed that the in-situ formed acid has ignorable negative effect on polymerization of substrate to humins. DFT explicitly elucidate that the decorated Pd nanoparticles by Cl species provided lower adsorption energy and energy of C-O cleavage than Pd sites. Furthermore, the strategy of in-situ formation of homogeneous acid and halogen-modified metal is also efficient for catalytic conversion of other chlorinated carboxides to hydrocarbons with the ring intact.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

Universal rapid Joule carbothermal synthesis of flexible carbon/metal oxide lithiophilic membranes for high-performance lithium metal batteries,"© 2022 Author(s).Surface engineering of carbon materials induces structural modulation with appealing functionalities for versatile applications. However, practical deployment demands simplified modification steps and time-saving operations. Microwave technology can produce a strong instant magnetic-heating effect, avoiding the presence of a temperature gradient to cause nanoparticle agglomeration and multiple synthesis stages. Herein, we propose a rapid Joule carbothermal synthesis of a 3D flexible carbon cloth with ultrasmall metal oxide nanoparticles (MOx@CC) upon microwave irradiation within several minutes. Owing to the extensive selection of metal precursors, this approach can be applied to achieve a variety of active metal oxide nanoparticles decorated on carbon cloth. Furthermore, the modified carbon cloth can serve as a lithiophilic framework to efficiently homogenize Li+ flux and mitigate the dendrite formation. Ascribed to these merits, a prototype of the prelithiation MOx@CC anode paired with the LiFePO4 cathode exhibits satisfactory performance upon repetitive cycling, highlighting the possibility for a safe battery system.",Applied Physics Reviews
Well-defined metal-N4 sites coordinated defective carbon as efficient electrocatalysts for high performance lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe practical application of lithium–sulfur batteries has been limited by the detrimental shuttling behavior and sluggish conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), especially under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte dosage. Although experimental and theoretical studies show that introducing defect and Fe–N4 site in carbon materials is the desirable strategy to expedite LiPSs conversion, the synergetic effect between them for sulfur redox chemistry is hardly explored. Herein, derived from a well-define Fe–N4 macrocyclic pristine iron phthalocyanine molecules (FePc) coordinated on the defective carbon nanosheets (FePc-DC), the marriage and synergetic effect between defective carbon and FePc molecules can induce remarkable Fe center electron delocalization and regulate the local electron redistribution between FePc-DC interfaces, thus brings improved LiPSs adsorption ability and conversion reaction rate. Meanwhile, the robust two-dimensional flake texture with large surface area and abundant porosity ensures robust physical confinement and fast electron/ion transfer. Attributed to such unique features, the lithium–sulfur batteries with FePc-DC cathode delivers good electrochemical performance with high areal capacity of 5.53 mAh/cm2 under high sulfur mass loading of 4.9 mg/cm2 and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6.5 μL/mg, demonstrating great potential in advanced Li–S batteries.",Materials Today Energy

Multi-Dimensional Composite Frame as Bifunctional Catalytic Medium for Ultra-Fast Charging Lithium–Sulfur Battery,"© 2022, The Author(s).The shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) between electrodes and slow reaction kinetics lead to extreme inefficiency and poor high current cycling stability, which limits the commercial application of Li–S batteries. Herein, the multi-dimensional composite frame has been proposed as the modified separator (MCCoS/PP) of Li–S battery, which is composed of CoS2 nanoparticles on alkali-treated MXene nanosheets and carbon nanotubes. Both experiments and theoretical calculations show that bifunctional catalytic activity can be achieved on the MCCoS/PP separator. It can not only promote the liquid–solid conversion in the reduction process, but also accelerate the decomposition of insoluble Li2S in the oxidation process. In addition, LiPSs shuttle effect has been inhibited without a decrease in lithium-ion transference numbers. Simultaneously, the MCCoS/PP separator with good LiPSs adsorption capability arouses redistribution and fixing of active substances, which is also beneficial to the rate performance and cycling stability. The Li–S batteries with the MCCoS/PP separator have a specific capacity of 368.6 mAh g−1 at 20C, and the capacity decay per cycle is only 0.033% in 1000 cycles at 7C. Also, high area capacity (6.34 mAh cm−2) with a high sulfur loading (7.7 mg cm−2) and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (7.5 μL mg−1) is achieved.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters

Transition metal oxides (TMOs) nanostructures supported on MXene nanosheets based on van der Waals interactions are facile, highly efficient, and low-cost, with self-assemble properties that can easily control their packing density. The resulting TMOs/MXene nanocomposites perfectly integrate the advantages of both components. MXene nanosheets can serve as conductive substrates to grow TMOs nanostructures which can facilitate fast electron and ion transport to prevent aggregation of TMOs nanostructures in energy applications. In turn, the TMOs nanostructures act as spacers to isolate the MXene nanosheets and prevent their re-stacking during assembly, enriching interfacial contacts and preserving the active sites.

Li-decorated borophene–graphene heterostructure under gas adsorption,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdTwo-dimensional materials show great application potentials in gas sensor due to its high surface-to-volume ratio. In this regard, we investigate the adsorption energies of five gases: NH3, NO, NO2, H2S, and SO2, on borophene, with the help of the density functional theory (DFT). The results show the high adsorption capacity of borophene, but gas adsorption can lead to its structural instability with the greatest influence of nitrogen. However, the heterostructure of borophene and graphene (B/G) can inhibit the deformation and optimize the adsorption capacity of borophene. In order to enhance the adsorption of gas molecules on B/G, lithium is doped in the borophene layer, and it shows that the adsorption of sulfur gas can be significantly enhanced. In addition, the transport properties of Li-decorated B/G inhibitors are simulated by non-equilibrium Green's function method. The graphene composite and Li doping are found to have a great impact on the gas-sensitive properties of borophene, which provides new ideas for the application of borophene in sensors.",Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids
Nitrogen atom coordination tuned transition metal catalysts for NO oxidation and reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdDeveloping an efficient catalyst for NO oxidation and reduction at ambient temperature is a significant challenge. Recent studies have suggested that the N-coordinated transition metal (TM) single atom catalysts (SACs) have high catalytic activity and stability. Herein, we report the activation potential of a series of 3d TM atoms supported on N coordination-tuned graphene (GR) for NO oxidation and reduction. The results show that the N coordination pattern can greatly alter the catalytic reactivity of TM on the catalysts, and the TM atom on the catalysts with three-coordinated pyridinic nitrogen TM-N3@GR exhibit the strongest chemical activity. Among the TM-N3@GR catalysts, Ti–N3@GR is the most promising candidate. The rate constants and equilibrium constants were calculated to evaluate the kinetic and thermodynamic feasibility of the catalytic reaction, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the reduction of NO to N2 on Ti–N3@GR can occur at ambient temperature with a large exotherm of 6.99 eV, and the oxidation of NO to NO2 on Ti–N3@GR can easily proceed when the temperature reaches 360 K with a large equilibrium constant. Our studies are of great significance for understanding the performance of N coordination-tuned catalysts and designing Ti-based catalysts for NO oxidation and reduction.",Chemosphere
Multi-functional yolk-shell structured materials and their applications for high-performance lithium ion battery and lithium sulfur battery,"© 2022Lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells have aroused widespread concern regarding as prospective compositions for most commonly energy storage devices because of high specific capacity and excellent energy density. But some weaknesses still exist such as high cost and low theoretical specific capacity of Li-ion cell, which is difficult to meet people's increasing demand for high energy density. And unsatisfactory conductivity and notorious “shuttle effect” of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) for Li-S cell, which will affect the commercialization. In various structures of battery materials, yolk-shell structured materials, possessing hollow shell and interior core, show outstanding applied potential for the cells because of having appropriate pore sizes, abundant active sites, prevented aggregation of active materials, accommodated volume expansions and more facilitated channels for electrons and Li+ transportation and functional groups to effectively adsorb LiPSs. Thus many novel yolk-shell structured materials are applied to cell materials to resolve the problems mentioned above. In this review, recent progresses on yolk-shell structured materials used in the cells including their preparation methods, geometric morphology design, action mechanisms in enhancing electrochemical performances and safety are generalized.

Hierarchical porous carbon nanofibers embedded with ultrafine Nb2O5 nanocrystals for polysulfide-trapping-conversion Li-S batteries,"© 2022The practical application of lithium–sulfur (Li‒S) batteries is severely impeded by the sluggish redox kinetics and polysulfides shuttling. Herein, hierarchical porous carbon nanofibers (HPCNF) embedded with ultrafine Nb2O5 nanocrystals (denoted as Nb2O5-HPCNF) are designed and served as a duplex-functional separator for polysulfide trapping and kinetic enhanced Li–S batteries.

High-yield aqueous synthesis of partial-oxidized black phosphorus as layered nanodot photocatalysts for efficient visible-light driven degradation of emerging organic contaminants,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe layered nanodot derived from 2D materials is an emerging member of the advanced functional material family. However, its development in applications is still facing inevitable challenges, and one of them is the synthesis strategy with environmental consideration. Herein, we report an aqueous strategy for high-yield fabrication of black phosphorus (BP) layered nanodots. Without using any organic solvent, the initial red phosphorus (RP) fine powder is successfully converted to BP nanostructures at 180–205 °C under the low pressure of 2.7–7.8 MPa and the high yield of 78% is achieved. The synthesized BP nanodots are partial-oxidized, and demonstrate proficient photocatalytic abilities in the visible-light driven degradation of emerging organic contaminants. The photocatalytic mechanism of BP nanodots is dependent on the specific electronic band structure with an acceptor energy level at 0.6 eV above the valence band. The first principle calculation reveals that the surface oxidation layer assists the passivation by hydrogen in aqueous circumstance and establishes the receptor function of BP nanodots. Therefore, our study not only accomplishes a novel route for the environment-friendly fabrication of BP layered nanodot photocatalysts for efficient degradation of emerging organic contaminants, but also contributes to the in-depth understanding of layered nanodots.",Journal of Cleaner Production
Recognition of the catalytic activities of graphitic N for zinc-iodine batteries,"© 2022Rechargeable aqueous Zinc-iodine (Zn-I2) battery is attractive because of its high energy density, intrinsic safety and eco-friendly. However, the formation of highly soluble triiodide (I3−) intermediates due to the sluggish iodine redox kinetics greatly compromise its durability and practical energy density. Here, we report that the formation and crossover of the triiodide could be suppressed by catalyzing the iodine conversion with nitrogen doped porous carbons, which afford a robust zinc iodine battery with high energy density (320 Wh·kg−1) and ultra-long cycle life of 10,000 cycles. Our fundamental studies reveal the electrocatalytic activities are sensitive to the type of N heteroatoms, as confirmed by the decreased activation energy, Tafel slope and improved faradic current density of the iodine redox took place on the graphitic N enriched host. These merits are stemmed from the significant electron redistribution from graphitic N in carbon to iodine molecules after interaction, which not only thermodynamically strengthen the adsorption/redox conversion efficiency but also dynamically boost the triiodide/iodide conversion by lowering the dissociation energy barrier. In addition, the favorable nucleation/electrodeposition of solid iodine on graphitic N during cycling also benefits such direct one step conversion. This work provides the reference basis for the correlation of the catalytic activities and performance of Zn-I2 batteries.",Energy Storage Materials

All-in-one Janus separator for lithium–sulfur batteries with lithium polysulfide and dendrite growth suppressed at temperature gradient effect,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Designing an optimum separator configuration that can address severe lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling and uncontrollable Li dendrite growth at the evaluated temperature is imperative for developing a high-performance, reliable, and safe Li–S battery (LSB). Herein, a promising LSB separator design is proposed, which consists of LiPS catalytic layer (LCL) and thermal conductive layer (TCL) fabricated by dual side filtrating the flower-like vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) microspheres and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanosheets, respectively. The LCL between the separator and S-cathode as combined LiPS trapper and catalyst significantly improves the redox reaction and sulfur utilization. At the anode/separator interface, the TCL uniforms Li-ion flux and thermal distribution to prevent undesirable Li dendrite growth under the temperature gradient (TG) effect. The Janus-type LCL-TCL separator with two parallel functions can achieve synchronous improvements in cathodic and anodic performance in LSB. Consequently, the LSB with Janus-type LCL-TCL separator exhibits excellent cycling stability with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.036% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 1C and superior rate capability up to 4C.

Tandem Co–O dual sites on halloysite with promoted reaction kinetics for sulfur reduction,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesFacilitating sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) is a promising pathway to tackle the polysulfide shuttle effect and enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Catalysts with a solo active site can reduce a reaction barrier of a certain transition-intermediate, but the linear scaling relationship between multi-intermediates still obstructs overall SRR. Herein, we construct tandem Co–O dual sites with accelerating SRR kinetics by loading highly dispersed cobalt sulfide clusters on halloysite. This catalyst features Co with upshifted d-orbital and O with downshifted p-orbital, which cooperatively adsorb long-chain polysulfide and dissociate an S–S bond, thus achieving both optimal adsorption–desorption strength and reduced conversion energy barrier of multi-intermediates in SRR. The Li-S coin batteries using the electrocatalyst endows a high specific capacity of 1224.3 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C after 200 cycles, and enhances cycling stability with a low-capacity decay rate of 0.03% per cycle at 1 C after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the strategy of the tandem Co–O dual sites is further verified in a practical Li-S pouch battery that realizes 1014.1 mAh g−1 for 100 cycles, which opens up a novel avenue for designing electrocatalysts to accelerate multi-step reactions.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

Nonetheless, synthesizing some specific phases of metastable transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) remains a challenge due to the restricted selectivity under chemical and physical treatments, especially for direct growth of specific phase of TMDs on 2D substrates to form heterostructures. Taking the merits of MXene with tunable atomic vacancies and surface chemistry via surface functionalization, the phase of epitaxially grown TMDs on 2D MXene can be significantly affected. In this work, 1 T′-MoS2 and 1 T-MoSe2 were directly grown on electrochemically synthesized MXene under controlled oxidization conditions and selected MXene substrate. Owing to the synergistic effect of TMDs and MXene, the TMDs/MXene heterostructure catalysts exhibit good electrochemical activity under acidic conditions, with a low overpotential of 167 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Our work not only demonstrates the distinct chemical characteristic of various MXenes feasible for surface engineering which promotes the direct and in situ growth of phase controlled TMDs on MXene substrates but also displays the high electrochemical activity in TMDs/MXene heterostructure catalysts.",Nano Energy
Strain-regulated Gibbs free energy enables reversible redox chemistry of chalcogenides for sodium ion batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s).Manipulating the reversible redox chemistry of transition metal dichalcogenides for energy storage often faces great challenges as it is difficult to regulate the discharged products directly. Herein we report that tensile-strained MoSe2 (TS-MoSe2) can act as a host to transfer its strain to corresponding discharged product Mo, thus contributing to the regulation of Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) and enabling a reversible sodium storage mechanism. The inherited strain results in lattice distortion of Mo, which adjusts the d-band center upshifted closer to the Fermi level to enhance the adsorbability of Na2Se, thereby leading to a decreased ΔG of the redox chemistry between Mo/Na2Se and MoSe2. Ex situ and in situ experiments revealed that, unlike the unstrained MoSe2, TS-MoSe2 shows a highly reversible sodium storage, along with an evidently improved reaction kinetics. This work sheds light on the study on electrochemical energy storage mechanism of other electrode materials.",Nature Communications

In this work, we assembled a van der Waals heterostructure of TiS2/Ti2CS2 and investigated its possibility as an anode material for Li/Na/K-ion batteries (LIBs/NIBs/KIBs) by first-principles calculations. The results show that the TiS2/Ti2CS2 has excellent stability and metallic nature. The Li, Na and K ions exhibit extremely low diffusion barriers (below 0.4 eV) in the TiS2/Ti2CS2 interlayer, which predicts that it has remarkable rate performance. For NIBs and KIBs, the average open circuit voltages (0.626 V and 0.995 V) of TiS2/Ti2CS2 are in the range of 0–1 V and the theoretical specific capacities (566 mA·h/g and 283 mA·h/g) are higher than those (35 mA·h/g and 279 mA·h/g) of graphite anode for the corresponding batteries.

Construction of Ultrathin Layered MXene-TiN Heterostructure Enabling Favorable Catalytic Ability for High-Areal-Capacity Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s).Catalysis has been regarded as an effective strategy to mitigate sluggish reaction kinetics and serious shuttle effect of Li–S batteries. Herein, a spherical structure consists of ultrathin layered Ti3C2Tx-TiN heterostructures (MX-TiN) through in-situ nitridation method is reported. Through controllable nitridation, highly conductive TiN layer grew on the surface and close coupled with interior MXene to form unique 2D heterostructures. The ultrathin heterostructure with only several nanometers in thickness enables outstanding ability to shorten electrons diffusion distance during electrochemical reactions and enlarge active surface with abundant adsorptive and catalytic sites. Moreover, the (001) surface of TiN is dominated by metallic Ti–3d states, which ensures fast transmitting electrons from high conductive MX-TiN matrix and thus guarantees efficient catalytic performance. Calculations and experiments demonstrate that polysulfides are strongly immobilized on MX-TiN, meanwhile the bidirectional reaction kinetics are catalytically enhanced by reducing the conversion barrier between liquid LiPSs and solid Li2S2/Li2S. As a result, the S/MX-TiN cathode achieves excellent long-term cyclability with extremely low-capacity fading rate of 0.022% over 1000 cycles and remarkable areal capacity of 8.27 mAh cm−2 at high sulfur loading and lean electrolytes.

Revisiting the Role of Physical Confinement and Chemical Regulation of 3D Hosts for Dendrite-Free Li Metal Anode,"© 2022, The Author(s).Lithium metal anode has been demonstrated as the most promising anode for lithium batteries because of its high theoretical capacity, but infinite volume change and dendritic growth during Li electrodeposition have prevented its practical applications. Both physical morphology confinement and chemical adsorption/diffusion regulation are two crucial approaches to designing lithiophilic materials to alleviate dendrite of Li metal anode. However, their roles in suppressing dendrite growth for long-life Li anode are not fully understood yet. Herein, three different Ni-based nanosheet arrays (NiO-NS, Ni3N-NS, and Ni5P4-NS) on carbon cloth as proof-of-concept lithiophilic frameworks are proposed for Li metal anodes. The two-dimensional nanoarray is more promising to facilitate uniform Li+ flow and electric field. Compared with the NiO-NS and the Ni5P4-NS, the Ni3N-NS on carbon cloth after reacting with molten Li (Li-Ni/Li3N-NS@CC) can afford the strongest adsorption to Li+ and the most rapid Li+ diffusion path. Therefore, the Li-Ni/Li3N-NS@CC electrode realizes the lowest overpotential and the most excellent electrochemical performance (60 mA cm−2 and 60 mAh cm−2 for 1000 h). Furthermore, a remarkable full battery (LiFePO4||Li-Ni/Li3N-NS@CC) reaches 300 cycles at 2C.

Recent progress on enhancing the Lithiophilicity of hosts for dendrite-free lithium metal batteries,"© 2022The renaissance of lithium (Li) metal batteries points the direction for next-generation high-energy-density electrochemical energy storage systems. Unfortunately, their practical implementation has been plagued by the uncontrolled growth of Li dendrites, which is considered to be closely related to the properties of substrates/hosts for Li metal deposition. Poor lithiophilicity of substrates can lead to a high nucleation barrier, in turn inducing the inhomogeneous deposition of Li metal. Over the past few decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to improving the lithophilicity of deposited substrates. However, there is not any endeavor to systematically summarize the impressive progress and circumvent this difficult problem. In this work, we start with an introduction of the importance of Li nucleation behavior for Li metal deposition. Then, we classify and screen out the methods to quantitatively characterize the lithophilicity of deposited substrates. Afterwards, the existing strategies to enhance the lithiophilicity of deposited substrates are highlighted. Finally, personal insights and perspectives on the development direction of Li metal batteries focusing on superior lithiophilicity are proposed, which may broaden the horizons for the understanding of lithophilicity nature and provide guidance for the design of Li metal batteries.",Energy Storage Materials

Herein, a hierarchically porous membrane loaded with fully dispersed single-layered MXene is fabricated via a facile phase inversion method for a high-areal-capacity Li-S battery. The 3D hierarchical porous structure can strengthen Li+ and electron transporting, accommodate the volumetric expansion of sulfur, enable high sulfur loading and provide ample active sites for LiPSs anchoring. More importantly, the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets disperse uniformly in the framework prevents restacking of the MXenes layer, which makes full use of both sides of the nanosheets, thus further improves the diffusion of Li+ and enriches active sites for adsorption and catalysis of LiPSs. Benefitting from the above-multiplexed functionality, the Li-S batteries show high specific capacity and cycle stability at high sulfur loading.

Flexible self-supporting metal-free N-doped graphene membrane as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022The exploration of highly active and low–cost non–noble metal or even metal–free electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) prove much vital for the development of advanced energy storage and conversion systems. Metal–free carbon–based electrocatalysts attract much attention due to their rich resource and low expenditure, but their practical application still remains as a huge challenge. In this work, flexible self–supporting metal–free N–doped graphene (NG) membrane is prepared by a blade coating assisted hydrothermal method. The morphology, structure and other physicochemical properties of this NG membrane are systematically characterized and analyzed. The results reveal that the resultant NG membrane shows unique flexible self–supporting architecture and achieves successful N doping, which guarantees excellent flexibility and tensile strength, and strengthens the intrinsic catalytic activity, electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity of NG membrane. As a consequence, when directly used as the OER electrocatalyst, the obtained NG membrane displays much promoted catalytic activity and stability, which is comparable or even superior to those previously reported metal–free electrocatalysts for OER. Obviously, this work provides a good guidance on developing low–cost and high–performance metal–free electrocatalysts for energy–related electrocatalytic reactions.",Applied Surface Science
"Using the aluminum decorated graphitic-C3N4 quantum dote (QD) as a sensor, sorbent, and photocatalyst for artificial photosynthesis; a DFT study","© 2022 Elsevier Inc.In this project, we have investigated the possibility of mimicking the natural photosynthesis, as well as sensing and adsorption application of aluminum decorated graphitic C3N4 (Al-g-C3N4) QDs (toward some air pollutants containing CO, CO2, and SO2). The results of the potential energy surface (PES) studies show that in all three adsorption processes, the energy changes are negative (−10.70 kcal mol−1, -16.81 kcal mol−1, and -79.97 kcal mol−1 for CO, CO2, and SO2 gasses, respectively). Thus, all of the adsorption processes (mainly SO2) are spontaneous. Moreover, the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) investigations indicate that the Al-g-C3N4 QD could be used as a suitable semiconductor sensor for detection of CO, and CO2 (as carbon oxides) in one hand, and SO2 gaseous species on the other hand. Finally, the results reveal that those QDs could be applied for artificial photosynthesis (in presence of CO2; Δμh-e = 1.43 V), and for water splitting process for the H2 generation (Δμh-e = 1.23 V) as a clean fuel for near future.",Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling
First-principles study on electronic and optical properties of van der Waals heterostructures stacked by g-ZnO and Janus-WSSe monolayers,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this paper, we designed van der Waals heterostructures by stacking g-ZnO and Janus WSSe monlayers with each other, and selected two most stable structures of them for in-depth study. The AA-stacking g-ZnO/Janus-WSeS heterostructure shows a type-I band arrangement. Staggered gap of AB-stacking g-ZnO/Janus-WSS heterostructure indicates it exhibits a typical type-II band arrangement. Further investigations show that the band alignment of AB-stacking g-ZnO/Janus-WSS heterostructure meets the requirement of water redox potentials at PH = 7. To explore the regulation effect on these two heterostructures, a biaxial strain parallel to the stacking layers from −6 to 8 % is applied. Results show the type-I AA-stacking g-ZnO/Janus-WSeS vdW heterostructure can be transformed to type-II under a moderate negative biaxial strain. For AB-stacking g-ZnO/Janus-WSSe vdW heterostructure, a suitable strain can be applied to tune the band gap and the band alignment to meet the requirement of photoelectric devices. In addition, the absorption coefficients of these two heterostructures at different strains were calculated. Results show negative strain will enhance the absorption of UV light and weaken the absorption of visible light. The favorable band edge positions and strong absorption in visible light and UV light make the AB-stacking g-ZnO/Janus-WSSe vdW heterostructure as a potential UV irradiation catalyst for water splitting.",Applied Surface Science

However, the underestimated but non-negligible dendrites of Li anode have been observed to shorten battery lifespan. Herein, a composite separator (TiO2−x@PP), in which TiO2 with electron-localized oxygen vacancies (TiO2−x) is coated on a commercial PP separator, is fabricated to homogenize lithium ion transport and stabilize the lithium anode interface. With the utilization of TiO2−x@PP separators, the symmetric lithium metal battery displays enhanced cycle stability over 800 h under a high current density of 8 mA cm−2. Moreover, the LMBs assembled with high-loading LiFePO4 (9.24 mg cm−2) deliver a stable cycling performance over 900 cycles at a rate of 0.5 C. Comprehensive theoretical studies based on density functional theory (DFT) further unveil the mechanism. The favorable TiO2−x is beneficial for facilitating fast Li+ migration and impeding anions transfer. In addressing the Li dendrite issues, the use of TiO2−x@PP separator potentially provides a facile and attractive strategy for designing well-performing LMBs, which are expected to meet the application requirements of rechargeable batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Atomically Dispersed Iron Active Sites Promoting Reversible Redox Kinetics and Suppressing Shuttle Effect in Aluminum–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s).Rechargeable aluminum–sulfur (Al–S) batteries have been considered as a highly potential energy storage system owing to the high theoretical capacity, good safety, abundant natural reserves, and low cost of Al and S. However, the research progress of Al–S batteries is limited by the slow kinetics and shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides intermediates. Herein, an interconnected free-standing interlayer of iron single atoms supported on porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (FeSAs-NCF) on the separator is developed and used as both catalyst and chemical barrier for Al–S batteries. The atomically dispersed iron active sites (Fe–N4) are clearly identified by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge structure. The Al–S battery with the FeSAs-NCF shows an improved specific capacity of 780 mAh g−1 and enhanced cycle stability. As evidenced by experimental and theoretical results, the atomically dispersed iron active centers on the separator can chemically adsorb the polysulfides and accelerate reaction kinetics to inhibit the shuttle effect and promote the reversible conversion between aluminum polysulfides, thus improving the electrochemical performance of the Al–S battery. This work provides a new way that can not only promote the conversion of aluminum sulfides but also suppress the shuttle effect in Al–S batteries.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters

The as-synthesized catalyst exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with an overpotential of 91 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 74 mV/dec in alkaline solution, and outstanding stability owing to the high conductivity, abundant interfacial active sites, and synergistic effect between Ni and Mo2C nanoparticles. This electrocatalyst as bifunctional electrode possesses an applied voltage of 1.64 V at 10 mA/cm2 and long-term durability in an electrolysis cell. Moreover, density functional theory calculations reveal that the electron transfer across Ni/Mo2C heterointerfaces could optimize the water adsorption/dissociation and H adsorption/desorption capacities, thereby boosting the intrinsic HER activity.",Materials Today Nano
Pyrazine and crown ethers: functional covalent organic polymers for (solar-assisted) high capacity and rate performance lithium-organic battery,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMultifunctional two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic polymers (COPs) benefiting from unique features display great potential in lithium-organic batteries yet are rarely reported. In this work, we fabricate a novel conjugated polymer (TQ-COP) functioned with flexible crown ethers and pyrazine redox-active sites, used as an organic rechargeable battery cathode. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and 13C cross-polarization and magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) verify the chemical identity of redox-active units formed during polymerization. In this structure, pyrazine-redox components exhibit a maximum six-electron transfer per active site, resulting in an initial specific capacity of 162 mA h/g(20 mA/g). Because of macrocyclic cavities and preferential coordination with the alkali metal ions of crown ethers, the rate determining step is changed into a charge transfer process, urging TQ-COP to emerge with a superior rate performance (132 mA h/g at 2 C, 81% vs. 0.1 C). Furthermore, the introduction of crown ethers facilitates photo-excited charge-carriers transfer by narrowing the HOMO-LUMO gap, rendering a photo-assisted lithium-organic battery with significant photovoltage responses and ∼10% improvement of battery round-trip efficiency under illumination, demonstrating its promising capability of solar energy utilization. This work proposes new insights into multifunctional COPs for advanced lithium-organic batteries.",Materials Today Chemistry
Recent advancements in the synthesis and electrocatalytic activity of two-dimensional metal–organic framework with bimetallic nodes for energy-related applications,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Bimetallic 2-D materials especially metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a fascinating class of materials because of their high active surface area and synergistic effect of bimetals. The ultrathin structure helps in enhancing the conductivity with the increase in exposed active sites which ultimately facilitates the catalytic activity of the 2-D bimetallic MOFs for energy applications. The catalytic activity of 2-D bimetallic MOF can be explained using electroanalytical methods like impedance, cyclic voltammetry, and Tafel plots. To understand catalysis at the molecular level in terms of the charge transfer kinetics and study the effect of unsaturated metal sites on catalysis density functional theory can be employed.

Strain engineering on the electronic properties and interface contact of graphene/GeN3 van der Waals heterostructure,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Graphene-based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have shown great potential in electronic and optoelectronic nanodevices. Herein, we investigate the electronic property and Schottky barrier of graphene/GeN3 vdW heterostructure by first-principles calculations. It is noted that the electronic natures of graphene and GeN3 monolayers are well preserved in the heterostructure lattice due to the weak vdW interaction. Interestingly, the p-type Schottky contact in graphene/GeN3 heterostructure with a barrier height of 0.21 eV can be effectively tuned by both vertical and horizontal strains. Herein, the carrier concentration in the graphene layer reaches ∼1013 cm−2 level by strain engineering. It is noteworthy that the designed optoelectronic field-effect transistor based on graphene/GeN3 heterostructure exhibits distinguished responsivity of 0.297 AW−1 and impressive external quantum efficiency of 54.5% under illumination based on further non-equilibrium Green's function simulations.

An extraordinary Na-S battery enabled by a carbon nanosheet host loaded with Fe-accelerator and TiO2-inhibitor,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The inexpensive room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery has attracted extensive attention due to its various potential application but is still suffering from the low utilization of sulfur, the shuttle effect and the sluggish reaction activity of sodium polysulfides (SPSs). In this work, a TiO2/sulfur/atomic-iron loaded carbon nanosheet cathode is designed for high performance RT Na-S battery. When the atomic iron exists, a much higher electrochemical activity of sulfur was obtained, indicating the atomic iron can accelerate the conversion of SPSs. Furthermore, the TiO2 layer can inhibit the shuttle effect of SPSs and the side-reaction between the intermediates and carbonate electrolyte. As a result, the constructed sulfur cathode exhibits a high reversible capacity (569.9 mAh g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of 57.57%) at 0.1 A g−1 and outstanding cycling performance (507 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles).

Nanosheets-stacked Al2O3-flower anchoring Pt catalyst for intensified ethylene production from ethane dehydrogenation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdCatalytic ethane dehydrogenation (CEDH) to ethylene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes due to the shale gas revolution, but the dominant Pt-based catalysts still suffer from fast deactivation, caused by coke formation and Pt sintering. Herein, we report a catalyst of nanosheets-stacked Al2O3-flower anchoring Pt species onto pentacoordinated Al (AlV) sites with a low Pt loading of only 0.07 wt%. This catalyst was prepared by a simple wet impregnation method without introducing any promoter, exhibiting a stable ethane conversion of 25–27 % (close to thermodynamic equilibrium conversion) with ethylene selectivity of 95–97 % within a single running of 300 h (590 °C, 33 vol% C2H6/N2, GHSVC2H6 of 2100 mL h−1 g−1), and moreover, a high TOF value of 6084 h−1 could be achieved. This work offers a promising CEDH catalyst, with both very high Pt dispersion (from appropriate amount of AlV sites) and intensified mass transfer (from nanosheet feature).",Fuel
In situ confined pyrolysis preparation of graphene-wrapped FePt nanoparticles anchored on N-doped hierarchically porous graphitic carbon nanoflakes for boosting oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Development of high-efficiency and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is significant for commercial manufacturing of fuel cells. Herein, graphene-wrapped FePt alloyed nanoparticles anchored on N-doped hierarchically porous graphitic carbon nanoflakes (G-FePt@N-GCFs) were prepared by confined pyrolysis of the mixed metal precursors and dicyandiamide. Notably, dicyandiamide in situ polymerized to graphitic carbon nitride to further adsorb and confine metal ions, finally harvesting graphene-wrapped FePt nanoparticles under high temperature, accompanied by forming the N-doped graphitic carbon nanoflakes. The controlled experiments substantiate significance of the pyrolysis temperature and metal types. The resultant G-FePt@N-GCFs showed appealing ORR activity (Eonset = 1.01 V; E1/2 = 0.86 V vs. RHE), and durability (E1/2 negatively shifts for 12 mV within 2000 cycles), outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst in the alkaline environment.

Development of high-energy non-aqueous lithium-sulfur batteries via redox-active interlayer strategy,"© 2022, UChicago Argonne, LLC, Operator of Argonne National Laboratory.Lithium-sulfur batteries have theoretical specific energy higher than state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. However, from a practical perspective, these batteries exhibit poor cycle life and low energy content owing to the polysulfides shuttling during cycling. To tackle these issues, researchers proposed the use of redox-inactive protective layers between the sulfur-containing cathode and lithium metal anode. However, these interlayers provide additional weight to the cell, thus, decreasing the practical specific energy. Here, we report the development and testing of redox-active interlayers consisting of sulfur-impregnated polar ordered mesoporous silica. Differently from redox-inactive interlayers, these redox-active interlayers enable the electrochemical reactivation of the soluble polysulfides, protect the lithium metal electrode from detrimental reactions via silica-polysulfide polar-polar interactions and increase the cell capacity. Indeed, when tested in a non-aqueous Li-S coin cell configuration, the use of the interlayer enables an initial discharge capacity of about 8.5 mAh cm−2 (for a total sulfur mass loading of 10 mg cm−2) and a discharge capacity retention of about 64 % after 700 cycles at 335 mA g−1 and 25 °C.",Nature Communications

Quantum Dots Compete at the Acme of MXene Family for the Optimal Catalysis,"© 2022, The Author(s).It is well known that two-dimensional (2D) MXene-derived quantum dots (MQDs) inherit the excellent physicochemical properties of the parental MXenes, as a Chinese proverb says, “Indigo blue is extracted from the indigo plant, but is bluer than the plant it comes from.” Therefore, 0D QDs harvest larger surface-to-volume ratio, outstanding optical properties, and vigorous quantum confinement effect. Currently, MQDs trigger enormous research enthusiasm as an emerging star of functional materials applied to physics, chemistry, biology, energy conversion, and storage. Since the surface properties of small-sized MQDs include the type of surface functional groups, the functionalized surface directly determines their performance. As the Nobel Laureate Wolfgang Pauli says, “God made the bulk, but the surface was invented by the devil,” and it is just on the basis of the abundant surface functional groups, there is lots of space to be thereof excavated from MQDs. We are witnessing such excellence and even more promising to be expected. Nowadays, MQDs have been widely applied to catalysis, whereas the related reviews are rarely reported. Herein, we provide a state-of-the-art overview of MQDs in catalysis over the past five years, ranging from the origin and development of MQDs, synthetic routes of MQDs, and functionalized MQDs to advanced characterization techniques.

Increasing N active sites by in-situ growing conformal C3N4 layer in hierarchical porous carbon-based networks for fast Li+ transfer and polysulfide anchoring in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022Various challenges remain to be overcome in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, including the volume expansion and low conductivity of sulfur, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and the sluggish redox reaction in the cell. Herein, we propose a multilayered conductive framework by the in situ growth of a conformal graphene-like C3N4 (GCN) coating on porous CNT@NC networks with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the core and N-doped carbon (NC) as the crosslinking shell. The abundant N in the GCN coating increased the surface N concentration of the framework from 14.38% to 18.77%, which enriched the active sites in the frameworks for the adsorption and catalysis conversion of LiPSs and Li2S with a low energy barrier. Furthermore, the scalable frameworks can provide an 85% porosity for a sufficient reaction interface and accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur. The synergistic effect between GCN and the highly conductive hierarchical structure can accelerate the transport of Li+ and electrons as well as the diffusion of electrolyte. Benefitting from the above advantages, the Al-free CNT@NC@GCN electrode exhibits a reversible capacity of 647.6 mAh g−1 after cycling for 450 cycles at 1C with a low capacity fading rate of 0.09% per cycle.

Phase interface engineering of metal selenides heterostructure for enhanced lithium-ion storage and electrocatalysis,"© 2022Biphasic or multiphase heterostructures hold attractive prospects in engineering advanced electrode materials for energy-related applications owing to the appealing synergistic effect; however, they still suffer from unsatisfied electrochemical activity and reaction kinetics. Herein, guided by density functional theory calculation, a well-engineered selenides heterostructure with high-density Ni3Se4-NiSe2 biphasic interfaces that fastened in N, O-codoped carbon matrix, was developed for high-performance lithium storage and electrocatalysis. By controlled selenylation of metal–organic framework (MOF), a series of NiSex@C hybrids (Ni3Se4@C, Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-1, Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-2, and NiSe2@C) with tunable biphasic components and grain sizes were prepared. Abundant two-phase interfaces with higher interface density are generated inside the Ni3Se4/NiSe2-1 induced by much smaller nanograins in comparison with the Ni3Se4/NiSe2-2, so that significant charge redistribution and faster electrons/Li+ ions transfer kinetics are achieved within the selenides, which are proved by the mutual verification of experiment and theoretical analysis. Benefitting from this optimized heterointerfaces, the Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-1 electrode manifests reduced polarization, superior rate capability, and prolonged cyclic stability (621.3 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 for 1000 cycles; 362.3 mAh g−1 at 4 A g−1 for 2000 cycles) with respect to the Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-2, as well as excellent performance in LiCoO2//Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-1 full cell. Detailed electrochemical analysis confirmed rapid electrons/Li+ diffusion rates and more pseudocapacitive energy for the Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-1. Therefore, the Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-1 showcases superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and lithium storage performance. This work demonstrates the significance of interface modulation to boost the electrochemical performance of multiphase heterostructures for energy storage and conversion.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Hollow nanospheres constructed by ultrafine few-layered MoS2 partially with amorphous fragments homogeneously incorporated in N-doped amorphous carbon for enhanced lithium storage performance,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The rational design of ultrathin and few-layered structures for three-dimensional MoS2 nanospheres is crucial for achieving attractive lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, hollow nanospheres constructed by ultrafine and few-layered MoS2 homogeneously incorporated in N-doped amorphous carbon (HUF-MoS2/NC) have been successfully synthesized as high-performance anode for LIBs. Using Mo-glycerol spheres as templates and dopamine hydrochloride as coordination ligands, hollow Mo-glycerol-polydopamine precursors are formed with Mo-containing groups which are surrounded by organic carbon species. Consequently, the MoS2 is confined to the nanoscale and grows partially amorphous fragments while being uniformly embedded in NC. This unique architecture can not only hinder the substantial restacking between MoS2 interlayers, offering more active sites, but also vastly enhance the electrical conductivity and relieve the mechanical stress ascribed to volume changes. As a result, the HUF-MoS2/NC composite anode exhibits excellent cyclic stability (980 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 0.2 A g−1) and superior rate performance (498 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1) for LIBs.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Ultra-dispersed copper nanoparticles constructing crystalline-amorphous interface sites for alkaline water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.In literature, the creation of an interface between a highly conductive crystalline phase and an amorphous phase with unsaturated sites has been proven to be an effective strategy in the design of electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the procedural complexity and limited formation of interfaces have compromised the envisioned effects. In this work, the dense crystalline Fe2O3/amorphous Cu interface was created simultaneously by the combination of solverthermal and annealing processes. The results showed that the ultra-dispersed Cu nanoparticles attributed to the formation of crystalline-amorphous (c-a) interface sites, which facilitated the electron transfer with the tuned electronic structures as well as the favorable adsorption of surface oxygen species. As a result, the developed Fe2O3/Cu-PNC catalyst outperformed most of the competing bifunctional catalysts reported for both OER and HER operations.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Sandwich-Structured flexible interlayer with Co3O4 nanoboxes strung along carbon nanofibers on both sides for fast Li+ transport and high redox activity in High-Rate Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The conductivity and Li+ transfer of Co3O4 nanoboxes can be significantly improved by running conductive carbon nanofiber “wires” through them. Herein, a membrane is designed with N-doped carbon (NC) nanofiber core sandwiched between NC nanofibers embedded in Co3O4 nanoboxes (Co3O4@NC). Intertwined carbon nanofibers serve as flexible conductive support for transporting Li+ and electrons. Hollow Co3O4 nanoboxes are strung along the surface nanofibers to form a necklace-like structure, which is robust against volumetric expansion of sulfur, enables high sulfur loading, and provides additional active sites for anchoring lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and their catalytic reactions. During discharging, LiPSs anchored on Co3O4 surface are rapidly converted to Li2S when Li+ and electrons enter the nanoboxes. During charging, solid Li2S reverts to sulfur on Co3O4 surface while Li+ and electrons leave along the nanofibers. Moreover, strong bonding of Li+ with exposed oxygen atoms on the Co3O4 (3 1 1) plane helps separate Li+ from Li2S and decrease the Li2S dissociation energy barrier. The synergy between fast Li+/electron transfer and high catalytic activity effectively suppresses the shuttle effect and significantly improves the high-rate performance and cycling stability. Li-S cells using this Co3O4@NC-NC-Co3O4@NC interlayer deliver a specific capacity of 703.1 mAh g−1 after 450cycles at 1.0C. Even at a high sulfur loading of 4.94 mg cm−2, the cells maintain 718.2 mAh g−1 after 120cycles at 0.2C.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Constructing double-shell structured N-C-in-Co/N-C electrocatalysts with nanorod- and rhombic dodecahedron-shaped hollow morphologies to boost electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution and triiodide reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.With the increasing energy demands and impending climate change, significant concerns have been raised over the metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived porous carbons and their utilization for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and triiodide reduction reaction (IRR). However, the provision of high intrinsic activity, active-site accessibility, and structural stability of MOF-derived Co-embedded N-doped carbon (Co/N-C) for HER and IRR is challenging. In this work, core-shell MOF-in-MOF precursors are designed to construct novel double-shell N-C-in-Co/N-C electrocatalysts with nanorod- and rhombic dodecahedron-shaped hollow morphologies (NR-H-C and RD-H-C). The double-shell structured NR-H-C and RD-H-C significantly enhance the HER and IRR activity of Co-MOF-derived Co/N-C. Specifically, NR-H-C achieves a high N-content (10.35 at.%), large specific surface area (590.87 m2 g−1), and hierarchical porous configuration (micropores and mesopores). When NR-H-C is applied as the HER catalyst in alkaline electrolyte, it exhibits an admired overpotential of 123 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec−1. The solar cell adopting NR-H-C as counter electrode for IRR achieves a high short circuit current density of 16.77 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.745 V, a fill factor of 0.682, and a power conversion efficiency of 8.51%, higher than that of Pt-based solar cell (16.26 mA cm−2, 0.744 V, 0.602, and 7.28%). The elucidatory Volmer-Heyrovsky HER mechanism and reversed Volmer-Heyrovsky IRR mechanism give a better understanding of the enhanced dual-functional activity of NR-H-C.

Here we present a high-rate and robust quasi-solid-state Zn-air battery enabled by atomically dispersed cobalt sites anchored on wrinkled nitrogen doped graphene as the air cathode and a polyacrylamide organohydrogel electrolyte with its hydrogen-bond network modified by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide. This design enables a cycling current density of 100 mA cm−2 over 50 h at 25 °C. A low-temperature cycling stability of over 300 h (at 0.5 mA cm−2) with over 90% capacity retention at −60 °C and a broad temperature adaptability (−60 to 60 °C) are also demonstrated.",Nature Communications

Dynamic observation of dendrite growth on lithium metal anode during battery charging/discharging cycles,"© 2022, The Author(s).Lithium metal is considered one of the most promising anode materials for application in next-generation batteries. However, despite decades of research, practical application of lithium metal batteries has not yet been achieved because the fundamental interfacial mechanism of lithium dendrite growth is not yet fully understood. In this study, a series of reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was performed to investigate the electrochemical dynamic reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. It allows quantitative characterization of morphological phenomena and real-time interfacial visualization of the dynamic growth of dead lithium and dendrites during repeated charging. This computational protocol was utilized to investigate the dendrite mitigation mechanism when an electrolyte additive (hydrogen fluoride) is dissolved in an organic ethylene carbonate (EC) electrolyte solvent. It was confirmed that beneficial decomposition reactions between electrolyte components form a protective film on the anode surface, suppressing large interphase volume changes and unnecessary degradation reactions.",npj Computational Materials
Direct observation of elemental fluctuation and oxygen octahedral distortion-dependent charge distribution in high entropy oxides,"© 2022, The Author(s).The enhanced compositional flexibility to incorporate multiple-principal cations in high entropy oxides (HEOs) offers the opportunity to expand boundaries for accessible compositions and unconventional properties in oxides. Attractive functionalities have been reported in some bulk HEOs, which are attributed to the long-range compositional homogeneity, lattice distortion, and local chemical bonding characteristics in materials. However, the intricate details of local composition fluctuation, metal-oxygen bond distortion and covalency are difficult to visualize experimentally, especially on the atomic scale. Here, we study the atomic structure-chemical bonding-property correlations in a series of perovskite-HEOs utilizing the recently developed four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques which enables to determine the structure, chemical bonding, electric field, and charge density on the atomic scale. The existence of compositional fluctuations along with significant composition-dependent distortion of metal-oxygen bonds is observed. Consequently, distinct variations of metal-oxygen bonding covalency are shown by the real-space charge-density distribution maps with sub-ångström resolution. The observed atomic features not only provide a realistic picture of the local physico-chemistry of chemically complex HEOs but can also be directly correlated to their distinctive magneto-electronic properties.",Nature Communications
High-Energy Batteries: Beyond Lithium-Ion and Their Long Road to Commercialisation,"© 2022, The Author(s).Rechargeable batteries of high energy density and overall performance are becoming a critically important technology in the rapidly changing society of the twenty-first century. While lithium-ion batteries have so far been the dominant choice, numerous emerging applications call for higher capacity, better safety and lower costs while maintaining sufficient cyclability. The design space for potentially better alternatives is extremely large, with numerous new chemistries and architectures being simultaneously explored. These include other insertion ions (e.g. sodium and numerous multivalent ions), conversion electrode materials (e.g. silicon, metallic anodes, halides and chalcogens) and aqueous and solid electrolytes. However, each of these potential “beyond lithium-ion” alternatives faces numerous challenges that often lead to very poor cyclability, especially at the commercial cell level, while lithium-ion batteries continue to improve in performance and decrease in cost. This review examines fundamental principles to rationalise these numerous developments, and in each case, a brief overview is given on the advantages, advances, remaining challenges preventing cell-level implementation and the state-of-the-art of the solutions to these challenges. Finally, research and development results obtained in academia are compared to emerging commercial examples, as a commentary on the current and near-future viability of these “beyond lithium-ion” alternatives.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
Two-dimensional biphenylene: a promising anchoring material for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s).Trapping lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) on a material effectively suppresses the shuttle effect and enhances the cycling stability of Li–S batteries. For the first time, we advocate a recently synthesized two-dimensional material, biphenylene, as an anchoring material for the lithium-sulfur battery. The density functional theory calculations show that LiPSs bind with pristine biphenylene insubstantially with binding energy ranging from −0.21 eV to −1.22 eV. However, defect engineering through a single C atom vacancy significantly improves the binding strength (binding energy in the range −1.07 to −4.11 eV). The Bader analysis reveals that LiPSs and S8 clusters donate the charge (ranging from −0.05 e to −1.12 e) to the biphenylene sheet. The binding energy of LiPSs with electrolytes is smaller than those with the defective biphenylene sheet, which provides its potential as an anchoring material. Compared with other reported two-dimensional materials such as graphene, MXenes, and phosphorene, the biphenylene sheet exhibits higher binding energies with the polysulfides. Our study deepens the fundamental understanding and shows that the biphenylene sheet is an excellent anchoring material for lithium-sulfur batteries for suppressing the shuttle effect because of its superior conductivity, porosity, and strong anchoring ability.",Scientific Reports
"Chemical vapor deposition-grown nitrogen-doped graphene’s synthesis, characterization and applications","© 2022, The Author(s).The physical properties of carbon materials can be altered by doping. For instance, the electronic properties of graphene can be modulated by controlling the substitutional doping of the carbon lattice with N. In addition, C–N bonding configurations with three ring types are recognized: pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N. Controlling the type and relative density of various types of substitutional N is an important objective that requires an extremely high level of precision when the atomic lattice is constructed. This control can be accomplished only via bottom-up methods, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The number of reports on N-doped graphene (NDG) grown via CVD has increased over the past decade, but a reliable wafer-scale production strategy that can realize the desired atomic-precision growth of NDG is still lacking. To identify the most promising strategies and analyze the consistency of the results published in the literature, we review the CVD growth and characterization of two-dimensional NDG and two of the most popular applications of NDG films: field-effect transistors and energy storage devices.",npj 2D Materials and Applications

Structural control of a novel hierarchical porous carbon material and its adsorption properties,"© 2022, The Author(s).Novel hierarchical porous carbon materials (HPCs) were fabricated via a reactive template-induced in situ hypercrosslinking procedure. The effects of carbonization conditions on the microstructure and morphology of HPCs were investigated, and the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) on HPCs was explored. The as-prepared HPCs has a hierarchical micro-, meso- and macropore structure, which results from the overlap of hollow nanospheres possessing microporous shells and macroporous cavities. The carbonization temperature, carbonization time and carbonization heating rate played important roles in tailoring the nanostructures of HPCs. The BET specific surface area and micropore specific surface area can reach 2388 m2 g−1 and 1892 m2 g−1, respectively. Benefitting from the well-developed pore structure, the MB removal efficiency can exceed 99% under optimized conditions. The adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics can be well described by a pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model, respectively. Furthermore, such adsorption was characterized by a spontaneous endothermic process.",Scientific Reports
Single-dispersed polyoxometalate clusters embedded on multilayer graphene as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient Li-S batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s).The redox reactions occurring in the Li-S battery positive electrode conceal various and critical electrocatalytic processes, which strongly influence the performances of this electrochemical energy storage system. Here, we report the development of a single-dispersed molecular cluster catalyst composite comprising of a polyoxometalate framework ([Co4(PW9O34)2]10−) and multilayer reduced graphene oxide. Due to the interfacial charge transfer and exposure of unsaturated cobalt sites, the composite demonstrates efficient polysulfides adsorption and reduced activation energy for polysulfides conversion, thus serving as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. When tested in full Li-S coin cell configuration, the composite allows for a long-term Li-S battery cycling with a capacity fading of 0.015% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 2 C (i.e., 3.36 A g−1). An areal capacity of 4.55 mAh cm−2 is also achieved with a sulfur loading of 5.6 mg cm−2 and E/S ratio of 4.5 μL mg−1. Moreover, Li-S single-electrode pouch cells tested with the bifunctional electrocatalyst demonstrate a specific capacity of about 800 mAh g−1 at a sulfur loading of 3.6 mg cm−2 for 100 cycles at 0.2 C (i.e., 336 mA g−1) with E/S ratio of 5 μL mg−1.",Nature Communications
High-Index Faceted Nanocrystals as Highly Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for High-Performance Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s).Precisely regulating of the surface structure of crystalline materials to improve their catalytic activity for lithium polysulfides is urgently needed for high-performance lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. Herein, high-index faceted iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanocrystals anchored on reduced graphene oxide are developed as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts, effectively improving the electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries. The theoretical and experimental results all indicate that high-index Fe2O3 crystal facets with abundant unsaturated coordinated Fe sites not only have strong adsorption capacity to anchor polysulfides but also have high catalytic activity to facilitate the redox transformation of polysulfides and reduce the decomposition energy barrier of Li2S. The Li–S batteries with these bifunctional electrocatalysts exhibit high initial capacity of 1521 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and excellent cycling performance with a low capacity fading of 0.025% per cycle during 1600 cycles at 2 C. Even with a high sulfur loading of 9.41 mg cm−2, a remarkable areal capacity of 7.61 mAh cm−2 was maintained after 85 cycles. This work provides a new strategy to improve the catalytic activity of nanocrystals through the crystal facet engineering, deepening the comprehending of facet-dependent activity of catalysts in Li–S chemistry, affording a novel perspective for the design of advanced sulfur electrodes.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters

Using polyaniline as carbon source not only realized the doping of carbon with nitrogen, but also allowed homogeneous dispersion of Ni3Fe nanoparticles to achieve multiple reflection interfaces. The content of Ni3Fe can be used to control the impedance matching of the composites, while the dual loss mechanism of dielectric loss and magnetic loss was realized to promote EMW absorption performance. The polyaniline-derived carbon/Ni3Fe (PDC/Ni3Fe) nanocomposite with optimized composition had a minimum reflection loss (RL) of − 80.91 dB.

Heterostructured Mn clusters/N-doped carbon foams enhancing the polysulfides immobilization and catalytic conversion,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are favored for their high theoretical energy capacity and low production costs. However, their wide applications are currently challenged by the polysulfide shuttle effect and slow redox reactions resulting from the poor polysulfides immobilization-conversion kinetics in the sulfur cathodes. In this work, the heterostructure Mn Clusters/N-doped Carbon Foams composite catalyst was prepared by using the molten NaCl as template. The optimal electrode sample exhibited the improved chemisorption and catalytic conversion of the polysulfides. Sequentially, the polysulfide shuttle effect and volume expansion during the reaction were effectively alleviated. As a result, the assembled sulfur electrode achieved a discharge specific capacity of 505.8 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 1 C with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.065 % per cycle.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
MOF-808-derived Ce-doped ZrOF composite as an efficient polysulfide inhibitor for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The notorious polysulfide shuttle and sluggish kinetics seriously challenge the commercialization process of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, even though their addictive theoretical energy density and specific capacity. Herein, a MOF-808-derived Ce-doped ZrOF (Ce-ZrOF) composite is constructed by the impregnation of Zr-based MOF-808 film with Ce salt and carbonization as an efficacious polysulfide inhibitor in Li-S batteries, which is anchored on carbon cloth. With a hierarchical porous structure, sufficient adsorption sites and Ce-doping, the proposed structure is qualified for efficaciously trapping polysulfides through adsorption. Meanwhile, the metal Ce and oxygen vacancies facilitate the catalytic conversion of polysulfides, enabling the accelerated redox kinetics. Based on the above synergistic effect, the developed interlayer delivers a high initial capacity of 1048 mAh g−1 with a durable cyclability of a limited decay of 0.025% per cycle for 500 cycles under 1 C, a considerable rate performance of 744 mAh g−1 at 5 C and an outstanding area capacity of 9.6 mAh cm−2 with the high sulfur loading (10.8 mg cm−2).",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Zirconia-supported cobalt nanoparticles as high-performance sulfur cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is now a promising technology for energy storage. However, rapid capacity decay due to sulfur dissolution and shutting effect severely limit its commercial development. In this work, a NH2-UIO-66 metal organic framework-derived porous composite (Co-ZrO2@NC) consists of nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) and zirconium oxide (ZrO2) loaded with cobalt nanoparticles was prepared. The porous NC component not only increases the accommodation of sulfur in the cathode, but also benefits the charge transfer in sulfur electrochemistry. The Co and ZrO2 would act as active centers to enhance the adsorption/conversion of lithium polysulfide and improve its electrochemical utilization. When used in sulfur cathode, the Co-ZrO2@NC electrode shows excellent electrochemical performance with an initial specific capacity of 1073 mAh g−1 at a rate of 0.2 C and a reversible capacity of 1015 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, corresponding to a capacity retention of 94.6%. Furthermore, after 300 cycles at 1.0 C, corresponding to a capacity retention of 75.4%. Moreover, the cell also exhibits good rate performance (640 mAh g−1 at 3.0 C). Even at high sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm−2, the S/Co-ZrO2@NC cathode is able to deliver an areal specific capacity of 4.8 mAh cm−2",Nanotechnology
Advanced separator containing metallic cobalt-molybdenum carbide@ 3D porous carbon for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have many good prospects for electrochemical energy storage, but they still face some important challenges, such as lithium polysulfide shuttles, which leads to irreversible loss of active materials. In this work, for the first time, metallic cobalt-molybdenum carbide wrapped within 3D porous carbon, served as a functional layer (MoCo@CHS3) on the separator of high-performance Li-S batteries. The MoCo@CHS3 obtained through the sol-gel method composite renders superior cycling performance and structural stability. Electrochemical performance confirms that the 3D porous framework with large specific surface area and pore volume can reuse the sulfur, improve conductivity, and effectively suppress the shuttling problem on account of the polysulfide capture capability. Additionally, the MoCo@CHS3 electrocatalyst provides multiple adsorption sites to capture polysulfides and promote redox reactions of polysulfides, which limit the shuttle of polysulfides. Consequently, the Li-S battery with MoCo@CHS3-PP coated separator shows an excellent capacity of 1026.7 mAh g−1 at 1 C (sulfur load, 1.9–2.2 mg cm−2), and excellent cycle stability (after 600 cycles, the capacity decay rate was only 0.066%). A high discharge specific capacity of 1022.4 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C is obtained after activation and it remains at 780.7 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles when the sulfur load is 5.0 mg cm−2. The separators modified by MoCo@CHS3 have excellent application prospects in Li-S batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Carboxylate-assisted ZIF-derived Co nanoclusters anchoring hierarchically porous carbon as high-efficient zinc-air batteries cathode catalysts,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal and nitrogen-doped carbon (M-N-C) catalysts are generally considered to be ideal substitutes for platinum-based noble metal oxygen reduction catalysts. Owing to the significant Fenton effect of the Fe element and the subsequent instability, the Fenton-free Co-based N–C catalyst should perform better in ORR. Pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is commonly used to make Co-based N–C catalysts. Still, most of the MOF-derived catalysts reported so far have a microporous structure, which results in hindered mass transfer and partial Co-Nx active sites that cannot function as catalysis. Herein, Co nanoclusters (NCs) with high loading (7.96 wt%) were prepared on hierarchically porous carbon substrates via a carboxylate-assisted strategy. The mesoporous structure of Co nanoclusters/nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous carbon (Co NCs/HPNC) can facilitate mass transport. The smaller size Co nanoclusters can increase the contact area between the carbon matrix and Co-Nx active sites to effectively expose more active centers and increase the density of Co-Nx active sites. A synergistic effect of the two can greatly improve ORR results. Surprisingly, the Co NCs/HPNC catalyst shows excellent ORR activity under alkaline conditions, and Co NCs/HPNC has a better half-wave potential (0.88 V vs. 0.84 V) compared with 20 wt% Pt/C. And it only loses 5% of its current density after 36,000 s of operation, which is significantly less than Pt/C (20%). Furthermore, Co NCs/HPNC battery have a greater open-circuit potential, power density, and specific capacity than Pt/C-based zinc-air batteries (1.51 V, 109.6 mW cm−2, 818.1 mAh gZn−1 vs. 1.46 V, 92.4 mW cm−2, 716.8 mAh gZn−1). This discovery paves the way for high-efficiency electrocatalysts with hierarchically porous architectures and a large number of metal loads to be developed.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
"Molecular-level solvation and selectivity behavior of Na+, K+, and Li+ within glycerol-derived solvents","© 2022 Elsevier LtdEther-based acyclic solvents have a tendency to confine positively charged atoms, forming structures called podands. Due to the stability of these structures, podands have been identified as promising candidates for several different electrochemical applications. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the solvation and selectivity of Na+, K+, and Li+ by different glycerol-derived solvents. The structural properties suggest that the solvent-cation association is stable over a very wide temperature range. A strong correlation is observed between the more electronegative oxygen sites and preferential interaction with the cations, which suggests that the electrostatic oxygen-ion interactions dominate the coordination between these species. Significantly more intense interactions are observed between the solvents and Li+, versus Na+ or K+. These molecular-level thermodynamic insights provide fundamental support for further exploring the performance of glycerol-derived podand complexes in Li+ capture applications and/or electrolyte formulations.",Chemical Engineering Science
Bifunctional separator with a light-weight coating for stable anode-free potassium metal batteries,"© 2022The anode-free potassium metal battery (AF-KMBs, N : P = 0 : 1) with liquid electrolyte has been proposed through a separator composite directing strategy. A facile and feasible lithium niobate/Graphene (LiNbO3@G) composite was exploited to modify the glass fiber separator, which can realize high-performance AF-KMBs comprising a configuration of Cu||LiNbO3@G||K0.51V2O5. Due to the ferroelectric and polarization of LiNbO3, a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) was steadily formed at the anode interface after preliminary electrochemical activation. Combined with morphology observation and electrochemical characterization, it was proved that potassium was uniformly nucleated and selectively deposited on copper foil without obvious K dendrite. Attributed to the high conductivity of potassium ions and stable SEI, good Coulombic efficiency and long cycle life of the obtained AF-KMBs have been achieved. Consequently, our work demonstrates of great necessity to further explore the high-performance potential of anode-free potassium metal battery.",Electrochimica Acta
Modified Co electronic states in double-anionic CoPS nanocrystals induce highly efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Pyrite-type CoS2 with half-metal properties has attracted more attention in the energy field because it is a kind of non-precious metal electrocatalyst with inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and sustainable merits. Particularly, it can produce significant spin-polarized electrons from Co electronic states to run efficient hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). In this work, we focus attention on double-anionic CoPS nanocrystals (NCs) and explore electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Theoretical calculations indicate that phosphorus introduction into CoS2 shifts the d-band of Co atom towards the Fermi surface, making the surface activation barrier of CoPS (0.98 eV) far lower than that of CoS2 (1.41 eV). By growing the rod-like Co3(PO4)2 with surface decoration of CoPS NCs on the CoS2 wrapped carbon fiber paper as electrochemical cathode, we show that such a composite structure can effectively improve the escape efficiency of H2 due to large specific surface area. The current density reaches 10 mA cm−2 at 47 mV. The tafel slope is only 52 mV dec−1, which is far smaller than that of CoS2. Spectroscopic characterization suggests that the modified electronic states of CoPS NCs and good charge transport kinetics in the compound are responsible for the observed high-efficiency HER performance. This study provides a useful strategy for designing and fabricating efficient electrocatalysts with synergistic effect of double anions and hierarchical activity.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Synthesis of nickel@N-doped carbon nanotube foams for high sulfur-loading lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The practical applications of lithium sulfur batteries have been greatly restricted by the polysulfide shuttle effect and non-conductivity of sulfur. Here, we report a nickel-catalyzed carbonization method to synthesize three-dimensional (3D) nickel@N-doped carbon-nanotube (CNT) foams for lithium-sulfur batteries. The corresponding carbon/sulfur cathode with a high sulfur loading of 3.71 mg cm−2 possesses a high initial capacity of 855.6 mAh g−1 at 135 mA g−1 and good cyclic stability with a low fading rate of 0.153% per cycle for 100 cycles at 270 mA g−1. The growth of carbon thin layers on the nickel nanoparticles results in the encapsulation of the nanoparticles in the CNTs, which makes the carbon forms highly conductive and prevents the metal nanoparticles from being oxidized by polysulfides. The high conductivity is favorable for the electron transfer between polysulfides and carbon electrode. Moreover, the doped nitrogen atoms on the CNTs have strong chemical adsorption ability for polysulfides, accelerating redox reaction of polysulfides on the carbon electrode (i.e., suppressing the shuttle effect). These unique structural characteristics well explain the excellent electrochemical performance of the assembled batteries. It is believed that the fabricated carbon foam is a promising material for high sulfur-loading lithium-sulfur battery.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Effective adsorption and acceleration redox conversion towards lithium polysulfide by nanorod-like Sb-doped SnO2 nanofibers for high-performance lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have attracted increasing attention due to high theoretical energy density and low cost of sulfur. However, there are still many challenges regarding sulfur cathodes such as the “shuttle effect” of polysulfides, insulating properties of sulfur and Li2S2/Li2S, and the sluggish redox kinetics. In this study, the nanorod-like Sb-doped SnO2 nanofibers (ATO NFs) with hollow structure were prepared by the electro-blown spinning technology and calcination processes, and used as a sulfur host for cathode materials. The internal hollow structure and the nanorod-like structure on the surface of the nanofibers with the increased specific surface area are beneficial to load sulfur and improve transport channels of electrons and lithium ions. And the hollow nanofibers also can well accommodate to huge volume changes in the reaction process. More importantly, the ATO NFs with hollow structure have good physical confinement and chemical adsorption performance to polysulfides. Based on these merits, the ATO NFs composite cathode exhibits a high initial discharge specific capacity of 765.3 mAh g−1 and maintains 550.6 mAh g−1 after 900 cycles at a rate of 2 C with 1.9 mg cm−2 sulfur loading. More importantly, high initial area discharge specific capacity of the electrode is 5.5 mAh cm−2 at 0.1 C with sulfur loading of 5.6 mg cm−2. Even, at a rate of 0.2 C, the area capacity still is stabilized at 3.5 mAh cm−2 after 100 cycles. The work illustrates that the ATO NFs for LSBs exhibit good cycling stability over a long period of time, entering the ranks of high performance and ultra-stable capacity. And it also facilitate to expand the scope of application of ATO NFs in other related energy storage fields.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are considered to be one of the most promising batteries due to their high energy densities. However, severe problems have restricted their development during the progress of LSBs, including the poor conductivity of sulfur, the volume expansion during discharge, and the shuttle effect caused by polysulfides. Relevant studies have shown that hollow nanocomposites can alleviate the above-mentioned problems when used as cathode carriers for LSBs, attribute to versatile advantages of large specific surface area, adjustable pore structure, and controllable morphology. Therefore, an increasing number of researchers have conducted extensive research on the synthesis and applications of hollow nanocomposites.

However, the sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LPS) and its shuttling effects have impeded the practical applications of Li-S batteries. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomically dispersed metal-based sites have been applied as a promising candidate for electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries. Herein, we design and demonstrate a single atom Fe-N/C catalyst impregnated with N, P–doped carbon (FeN6–NPC), N, P–doped carbon material (NPC), as well as Fe2P nanoparticles anchored with N, P–doped carbon (Fe2P–NPC). In-depth XANES and FT-EXAFS analyses were used to characterize the precise architecture of SACs containing Fe-N/C active sites. The electrochemical results of SACs with Fe-N/C active site configuration reveal the highest catalytic lithium polysulfide conversion compared to the NPC and nanoparticle anchored samples. In addition, the SACs enable FeN6–NPC/S electrode to deliver a high discharge capacity of 1115 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and maintain 570 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles with excellent Columbic efficiency (>99%). This work successfully develops organic-based strategies for SACs that suppress lithium polysulfide formation, improve cyclic stability, and increase Coulombic efficiency for lithium-sulfur batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Integrating LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase and in-situ formed gel blocking layer for Li–S battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Engineering stable interface protective films are imperative to enable lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries long-term cycling as they can suppress the growth of Li dendrites and shuttle effect of Li polysulfides, which have been recognized as two major challenges for plaguing the practical implementation of Li–S batteries. However, most of these efforts only pay attention to one side of Li metal anode or cathode. Herein, we report a facile yet effective strategy that simultaneously overcomes the aforementioned challenges by using Li hexafluorophosphate/fluoroethylene carbonate (LiPF6/FEC) solution immersed separator, resulting in a LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase film at the surface of Li metal anode and an in-situ formed gel blocking layer on the separator-cathode interface. With joint theoretical calculations and characterization techniques, we confirm that the Li–S battery using the LiPF6/FEC soaked separator can achieve a better rate performance and cycling stability than that of using routine PE separator.

Here, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with nanometre-scale pores (pore size of ~8 Å) are designed as composite membranes to selectively conduct monovalent ion (Na+ ~7.1 Å vs Mg2+ ~8.6 Å) by size sieving. Compared with the commercial Neosepta CMX membrane, the COF composite membrane effectively inhibits the penetration of Mg2+ without sacrificing Na+ penetration flux in RED, which to a large extent reduces the energy loss in RED caused by the penetration of Mg2+. Even for Mg2+ solution with high molar fraction of 30 %, the maximum power density (Pd, max) of CCM only shows a slight decrease of 1.7 %. In contrast, the Pd, max of the commercial Neosepta CMX membrane severely decreases by 35.8 %. This study highlights the prospects of COFs as the significant material for designing monovalent ion selective membranes which can improve energy efficiency in RED.",Desalination
Removal of perfluorinated compounds at environmentally relevant concentrations on non-equivalent dual sites regulated by single-atom-strengthened biochar,"© 2022Removal of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) at environmentally relevant concentrations in drinking water is challenging. A novel K single-atom-strengthened biochar (K1-BC) is designed to effectively adsorb the representatives of PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), from 1 μg/L to below 70 ng/L (CPFOA+PFOS) in tap water under dynamic mode, which meets a health advisory level in drinking water from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Furtherly, an adsorption theory of non-equivalent dual sites (N-EDS) is firstly proposed to clarify the adsorption process and mechanisms, that is, the sites of K single-atom and adjacent C are the main adsorption sites for PFOA and PFOS. The difference charge density and adsorption energy reveal that the introduction of K single-atom could change the local environment to form the N-EDS, which could strengthen the adsorption ability of K1-BC to electronegative PFOA and PFOS. Moreover, the Bader charge transfer value of K1-BC is larger than that of Blank BC, implying that N-EDS construct a channel for electron transfer to enhance the adsorption ability and stability. This proposed adsorption theory is of vital significance to guide the synthesis of single-atom-strengthened biochar and the application for PFOA/PFOS removal at environmentally relevant concentrations in drinking water.",Separation and Purification Technology
Robust potassium metal anodes realized by ferroelectricity and high conductivity separator,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLow-cost potassium (K) metal batteries (KMBs) have drawn broad attention due to the prospect of wide applications. However, the applications of KMBs have been severely troubled by the problems from the K dendrites and dead K. The disordered K dendrite growth causes repeated fracture and repair of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and the aggregation of dead K detached from current collectors around the cathode region leads to rapid capacity attenuation in KMBs. Herein, a barium titanate/reduced graphene oxide (BaTiO3@rGO) composite on glass fiber (GF) separator was prepared with ferroelectrically spin-polarized and high conductive, which highly effective in inhibiting disorderly K dendrite growth and activate the inactive dead K by improving electrochemical performance without affecting the transport of positively charged K ions. The capacity retention ratio (CRR) and attenuation rate of full-cell of KMBs adopting BaTiO3@rGO separator are 87% and 0.02% after 380 cycles at 0.5A g−1, respectively. This research defines an effective strategy to inhibit K dendrites and activate dead K in KMBs.",Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing
A systematic review on recent advances of metal–organic frameworks-based nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The progress of environment friendly and cost-effective energy storage and conversion technologies to combat pollution and the impending energy problem has recently attracted the attention of the energy research society. The fabrication of materials to accumulate charge or expedite mass and electron transference in energy storage and transformation fields is imperative. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively utilized as worthy precursors for the production of carbon resources, metal–metal composites, and their combinations with variable and governable nanoscale structures and elemental configurations for electrochemical energy applications through evolving crystal-like mesoporous organic and inorganic hybrid constituents have been reported. However, the poor electrical conductivity and constricted nanopores of MOFs have been highlighted. Henceforth, MOF combinations, where MOFs are linked with a diversity of efficient components, have been found to alleviate the drawbacks of distinct modules. 0D nanomaterials, like quantum dots, 1D nanomaterials, like nanotubes, 2D nanolayered materials, and 3D nanostructured materials could be combined with MOFs to develop numerous MOF composites. In this review, we described several synthesis procedures of MOF compounds, with a special focus on the expansion of MOF based materials for several electrochemical energy storing and transformation submissions, such as, lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, supercapacitors, water splitting, oxygen reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, N2 reduction reaction, and photovoltaic cells. The organizational and compositional strategies of MOF derivative nanomaterials were comprehensively reviewed in order to provide inspiration and advice for imminent improvement of metal–organic frameworks-based nanomaterials for the electrochemical energy applications.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Overpotential regulation of vanadium-doped chitosan carbon aerogel cathode promotes heterogeneous electro-Fenton degradation efficiency,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.This work aimed at exploring the effect of optimal overpotential discrepancy between two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (OP2eORR) and metal reduction reaction (OPMRR) of the cathode on electro-Fenton (EF) system performance, and proposing strategy to eliminate overpotential discrepancy. Therefore, series of vanadium-doped chitosan carbon aerogel (xCCA-V) cathodes were fabricated by controlling graphitization degree. With carbonized temperature of 900 °C, the OP2eORR of the 900CCA-V was −0.5 V vs. SCE, the same with the OP for vanadium reduction reaction (OPVRR). This identical OP of the 900CCA-V endowed excellent EF performance, with ciprofloxacin removal of 98.1%, and TOC removal significantly increased by 41.8% compared with Ferrum-doped CCA (900CCA-Fe). Density functional theory calculation revealed efficient active sites for H2O2 adsorption on the 900CCA-V surface. Degradation pathways of ciprofloxacin and intermediates toxicity were determined. This work provides inspiration for developing strategy for overpotential regulation and design novel and efficient cathodes for enhancing EF performance.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Formation of hollow frameworks of dual-sided Fe/Fe3C@N-doped carbon nanotubes as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Rational design of effective bifunctional inexpensive oxygen electrocatalyst is highly important for Zn-air batteries (ZABs), which can accelerate both oxygen reduction/evolution reactions at the oxygen electrode. Herein, we present the formation of hierarchical hollow frameworks of dual-sided Fe/Fe3C@N-doped carbon nanotubes (FNCHFs) through a template-engaged method. Benefitting from the synergistic effect between the robust hollow frameworks and in-situ grown dual-sided N-doped carbon nanotubes, the FNCHF electrocatalyst presents enhanced mass/electron transport with high structural stability. As a result, the FNCHFs based bifunctional oxygen electrode demonstrates a desirable oxygen electrocatalytic activity and stability with a half-wave potential of 0.863 V for oxygen reduction and an overpotential of 340 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for oxygen evolution. The corresponding ZAB exhibits a high peak power density of 206 mW cm−2, a high specific capacity of 781 mAh gZn−1, and a good cycling stability more than 300 h.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Heteroatom-doped Ginkgo Folium porous carbon modified separator for high-capacity and long-cycle lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Alleviating the shuttle effect is the core issue to realizing the practical application of lithium-sulfur battery (Li-S battery). In this study, heteroatom-doped Ginkgo Folium porous carbon (HDGF) was synthesized. The HDGF has micro-mesoporous composite structure, super large specific surface area, and excellent electrical conductivity. Attractively, HDGF-modified separator forms a unique 3D porous structure, which improves the affinity with electrolyte and accelerates the transport of Li+. Coupled with the strong chemical adsorption of polysulfides by heteroatoms, the battery exhibits excellent performance. The battery with the HDGF separator can reach discharge capacity of 1150 mAh/g at 0.5C and with only 0.094 % attenuation rate of capacity per cycle after 500 cycles. Even at high sulfur loading (3.32 mg cm−2), the discharge capacity is 860.6 mAh/g after cycling 120 cycles at a current density of 0.5C. Furthermore, using in-situ Raman tests, the evolution and shuttle mechanism of polysulfides were probed, and the efficient limitation of polysulfides by HDGF was demonstrated.

Illumination enabling monoatomic Fe and Pt-based catalysts on NC/TiOx for efficient and stable oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Although various alloys have been extensively explored to enhance catalyst activity and stability in oxygen reduction, degradation of performance due to long-term operation has plagued the crowd. Here, we develop a catalyst synthesis strategy based on the coexistence of monoatomic Fe and Pt-based clusters/alloys on NC/TiOx. Fe/PtCo-NC/TiOx exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.948 V and mass activity of 3.69 A mgPt−1 at 0.9 V, the latter being approximately 32.1 times higher than that of 20% Pt/C (0.115 A mgPt−1). Additionally, it also shows maximum power densities of 952.2 mW cm−2 and 215.8 mW cm−2 in the H2/O2 fuel cell and Zn-air battery, respectively. The combination of illumination and calcination promotes the electron transfer between Pt and TiOx, thus enhancing the catalytic activity and stability. We also explore the approach and mechanism of using illumination to suppress catalyst performance degradation. The intermittent irradiation inhibits the dissolution of Pt to facilitate the Fe/PtCo-NC/TiOx durability beyond that of most reported metal catalysts, with a half-wave potential degradation of only 14 mV after 30,000 cycles. The ingenious use of illumination provides a simple and feasible strategy for the sustainable utilization of catalysts.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Selective catalytic oxidation of pollutant H2S over Co-decorated hollow N-doped carbon nanofibers for high-performance Li-S batteries,"© 2022Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is one of the most harmful pollutants to human health and the environment. Using carbon-based catalysts, H2S can be selectively oxidized to elemental sulfur (S) at room temperature and carbon-sulfur composites are produced, which enlightens a facile solution combining desulfurization with cathode preparation for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, a heterogeneous catalyst of cobalt decorated N-doped hollow carbon nanofibers (Co-NHCFs) is designed for realizing the integrated application, in which the electron redistribution arising from long-range interactions of Co/N-doped carbon significantly promotes the oxygen radical generation and H2S dissociation, leading to its robust catalytic activity for H2S oxidation. Benefiting from the hollow framework with capacious storage space for rapid gas diffusion, the in-situ fabrication of high S-loading carbon-based cathodes (S@Co-NHCFs) used for LSBs is achieved during the H2S oxidation processing. Due to the more favorable diffusion of H2S gas than liquid S, this kind of chemical reaction-induced deposition can realize a more uniform distribution of solid S upon carbon than the traditional method by molten infusion, which, coupled with the catalysis of heterogeneous effect on the reversible sulfur-redox reaction, results in superior electrochemical performance of S@Co-NHCFs in LSBs.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Double-active-site enables 2D B2S and B2S3 catalyst with suppressed shuttle effect and improved polysulfides redox kinetics in lithium-sulfur batteries: A first-principles study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The sluggish transformation kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the notorious shuttle effect induced by the emergence of highly soluble LiPSs have become the main obstacles preventing the application of lithium-sulfur batteries. The development of bifunctional catalysts capable of accelerating the LiPSs redox kinetics and anchoring these soluble LiPSs is highly desirable for achieving improved cycling performance and Coulombic efficiency. Herein, a two-dimensional B2S/B2S3 catalyst with atomically dispersed boron and sulfur sites was investigated as a potential additive to boost the anchoring of soluble LiPSs and the subsequent LiPSs transformation reaction. Based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrated that the adsorption strengths of soluble LiPSs on B2S/B2S3 monolayers are neither strong nor weak. This effectively inhibits the dissolution of LiPSs while retaining their structural integrity. Importantly, B2S/B2S3 exhibits remarkable catalytic activity toward the liquid-solid (Li2S4 to Li2S2) and solid-solid (Li2S2 to Li2S) reactions in the discharging process as well as the decomposition of Li2S in the charging process. This is crucial for achieving improved rate performance. Moreover, a high Li-ion mass transfer efficiency on B2S and B2S3 was achieved with Ebar values of 0.43 and 0.41 eV, which is beneficial for reducing diffusion-dependent polarization issues. Our results provide an alternative route for developing advanced sulfur cathode catalysts with a suppressed shuttle effect and desirable rate performance.",Applied Surface Science
Ti2CO2/Ti2CF2 van der Waals heterostructure with robust Schottky barriers under electric fields,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transition metal carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides (MXenes) are considered as multifunctional materials due to their various elemental composition possibilities, surface functional tunability, various magnetic orders, and large spin–orbit coupling. Herein, a novel Ti2CO2/Ti2CF2 heterostructure is designed and its electronic and interfacial properties are investigated based on first-principles calculations. Our results reveal that the band structures of Ti2CO2 and Ti2CF2 layers are well preserved in the heterostructure due to the van der Waals interaction between the two layers, and a n-type Schottky contact forms due to the band bending at the interface. The most striking and much novel property is that the Schottky barrier height is nearly independent of the intensity of external electric field which is kept along the direction perpendicular to the Ti2CO2 or Ti2CF2 plane. The result denotes that a Fermi level pinning behavior occurs upon varying the intensity of electric field, which can change the doping concentration of electrons in the Ti2CO2 layer. This robust Schottky barrier opens the possibility of MXenes device designs for nanoelectronics.",Applied Surface Science
Co-Mo microcolumns decorated with trace Pt for large current density hydrogen generation in alkaline seawater,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrolysis in seawater is cost-saving but challenging approach for hydrogen production. In this study, self-supported anticaustic three dimensional (3D) microcolumns anchored with trace Pt clusters on nickel foam (NF) is prepared through solvothermal followed by thermal reduction procedures (Pt-Co-Mo). The as-synthesized electrode owns superhydrophilic and aerophilic surface which favors close contact between the electrode and electrolyte and release of the generated hydrogen bubbles. Besides, the strong synergistic effect between Pt and matrix lead to a significantly improved HER intrinsic activity. Thanks to the above merits, the self-supported Pt-Co-Mo electrode presents outstanding HER activity, which only requires an extremely low overpotentials of 179.2 mV and 194.1 mV to reach a large current density of 2000 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH seawater, respectively. For overall water splitting, cell voltages down to 1.50 V and 1.51 V are necessary to drive 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH and alkaline seawater, respectively.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

In this work, Ni-CaO-Ca12Al14O33 and Ni-CaO-MgO bi-functional materials were prepared from carbide slag for H2 production in sorption-enhanced steam gasification experiments of cellulose/polyethylene mixtures. The H2 production and CO2 capture performances of Ni-CaO-Ca12Al14O33 and Ni-CaO-MgO in sorption-enhanced steam gasification of cellulose/polyethylene were studied and compared. Density functional theory calculations, including the density of states, electron differential densities, and adsorption energies were performed to investigate the effect of supports on the stability and reactivity of Ni-CaO-based bifunctional materials at a microscopic level. The results exhibit that polyethene contributes to improving the H2 production effectiveness of cellulose sorption-enhanced steam gasification, the optimum mass ratio of cellulose to polyethene is 0.5:0.5. The CO2 capture capacity, H2 yield, and H2 concentration using Ni-CaO-Ca12Al14O33 can be respectively 2.0, 2.6, and 1.4 times as high as those using Ni-CaO-MgO in the 20th cycle, which indicates the higher cyclic stability and catalytic activity of Ni-CaO-Ca12Al14O33. Density functional theory results also indicate that Ca12Al14O33 can better retain the stable structure of Ni-CaO-based materials, which is consistent with the experimental results. Compared with MgO, Ca12Al14O33 is a better framework for Ni-CaO-based bifunctional material for H2 production in the sorption-enhanced steam gasification process.",Fuel
Dissecting π-conjugated covalent-coupling over conductive MOFs toward efficient two-electron oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The metal-ligand (M-L) covalent coupling is of very significance for tailoring the activity and selectivity of metal-organic-framework (MOF) functional nanomaterials, yet it still remains elusive. Herein, based on the π-conjugated coordination chemistry, we have developed several conductive MOFs as active oxygen reduction (ORR) electrocatalysts with tunable H2O2 selectivity. Through tailoring the central metal and the first coordination sphere, weakly-electrophilic Cu sites coupled with strongly-oxidized aromatic 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) linkers are of high favor in a two-electron ORR pathway, resulting in an impressive H2O2 selectivity of 95 % and a superior H2O2 yield rate of 792.7 mmol·gcat−1·h−1 during ORR for conductive Cu-HHTP MOF catalysts. By correlative in situ synchrotron radiation XAFS and FTIR spectroscopies, the potential-dependent dynamic-coupling hydroxyl over Cu sites is found to effectively trigger the self-polarization of π-conjugated metal-ligand Cu-O-C centers of Cu-HHTP MOF via shrinking the first Cu-O coordination sphere, realizing fast 2e- ORR kinetics.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Nickel nanoparticles embedded N-doped mesoporous graphitized carbon nanoflake as multifunctional sulfur host for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries has long been obstructed by the critical problems of the lithium polysulfides shuttle effect and the intrinsically sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. In this study, nickel nanoparticles were embedded in N-doped mesoporous graphitized carbon nanoflakes (Ni-NMC) through the pyrolysis of polydopamine-coated nickel flakes followed by an acidic etching process. Homogeneous mesopores and highly graphitized carbon are formed by the thermal aggregation and catalytic effect of the nickel nanoparticles during the high-temperature pyrolysis. The nickel nanoparticles remain embedded in the substrate after the acidic etching process due to the protection provided by the carbon layer. The obtained Ni-NMC consists of ca. 3-nm thickness nanoflake, with a high specific surface area of 812.2 m2 g–1, a pore volume of 1.59 cm3 g–1, and a pore size distribution of 6–8 nm. When used as a multifunctional sulfur host, the as-synthesized Ni-NMC, due to its mesoporous and thin-flake architecture, high conductivity, and catalytic effect, is simultaneously able to confine sulfur species within the carbon host and bidirectionally promote the conversion of sulfur to the final lithium sulfide. As a result, a high-performance Li-S battery with a reversible capacity of 869 mA h g–1 at 0.2 C after 100 cycles and a remarkable specific capacity of 705 mA h g–1 at 1.0 C after 200 cycles with a decay rate of 0.05 % per cycle, was realized.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Nitrogen-doped carbon encapsulated Ru-decorated Co2P supported on graphene oxide as efficient catalysts for hydrogen generation from ammonia borane,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing high-performance hydrogen generation/storage materials and technologies is an essential step for applying hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells under the background of carbon peak and carbon neutralization strategy. Ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) features a high volumetric and gravimetric density of hydrogen, showing great potential for chemical hydrogen storage. Exploring low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts is an essential prerequisite for hydrogen generation through AB hydrolysis under mild conditions. Herein, with rationally designing Ru/Co metal-organic framework (RuCo-MOF), a series of Co2P nanoparticles doping with low-content Ru embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon supported on graphene oxide (Ru-Co2P@N-C/GO) were synthesized via a one-pot phosphorization process.

Boosting sulfur catalytic kinetics by defect engineering of vanadium disulfide for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The incomplete sulfur conversion and serious shuttle effect caused by sluggish sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) have hindered the practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries for many years. Developing efficient catalysts and fundamentally understanding the catalytic mechanism can largely promote the application of Li-S batteries. In this work, the metallic sulfur-defect vanadium disulfide (D-VS2) nanosheets with large specific areas have been synthesized by a one-pot solvothermal method, and introduced as a modified layer on a polypropylene (PP) separator. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and electrochemical investigations have revealed the essential catalytic mechanism from atomic level to macro-scale. The introduced sulfur vacancies in D-VS2 can increase the coordination unsaturation sites, lead to the charge re-distribution on VS2 nanosheets, and remarkably promote the chemical anchoring and catalytic kinetics of LiPSs in Li-S batteries. As a result, the D-VS2 modified Li-S battery achieves a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1492.2 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and excellent cycling stability with a decay rate of 0.07% over 1000 cycles at 1.0C. Even under a high sulfur loading of 8.26 mg cm−2, the battery can still obtain a superb areal capacity up to 6.2 mAh cm−2 after 60 cycles at 0.1C. These results suggest that the proposed defect engineering strategy is promising for advanced Li-S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Construction of composite separator with 3D hierarchical spinel structure in Lithium-Sulfur batteries,"© 2022Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered the most promising candidate for achieving a low-cost high-energy–density system. One of the biggest deterrents during the practical application of Li-S batteries is the shuttle effect which causes fast capacity degradation and poor rate performance. 3D CoNi2S4 with 3D interconnected porous nitrogen doping carbon was prepared by sulfurizing the precursor Prussian blue analogues. The CoNi2S4 nanoparticles are confined in the carbon framework, affording interconnected macro-mesoporous channels. The constructed 3D CoNi2S4 modified separator effectively accommodates enough electrolytes and provides more exposed active sites that suppress the shuttle effect through trapping polysulfides and accelerating the lithiation of S8 to Li2S. Thus, Li-S batteries with 3D CoNi2S4-PP separators exhibit high-rate capacity and remarkable cycle stability. Furthermore, based on the modified separators, a high sulfur loading cathode delivers an areal capacity of 5.62 mAh cm−2. The separator size expands further to assemble the 1Ah Li-S pouch cell, confirming the practicality. This work provides an efficient strategy with a modified separator for high-performance Li-S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Three-dimensional structural confinement design of conductive metal oxide for efficient sulfur host in Lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The design of sulfur hosts with good conductivity, stable hierarchical porosity, and highly active sites is essential for efficient lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. In this study, a porous structured conductive Nb-doped and oxygen-deficient TiO2 (Nb-TiO2−x) is developed to serve as high-performance sulfur host. The introduction of oxygen vacancies and Nb-doping not only benefits the electrical conductivity of the oxide matrix, but also promotes the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) trapping and catalytic conversions. Moreover, the Nb-TiO2−x host matrix is designed into a three-dimensional ordered macroporous (3DOM) skeleton implemented with microporous N-doped carbon (NC) fillers. The 3DOM framework provides large and stable space for sulfur accommodation, whereas the hollow NC polyhedrons afford additional microsporosity and active sites for sulfur confinement. Benefited from these unique superiorities, the NC@Nb-TiO2−x-based sulfur cathode exhibits a capacity fading rate of 0.025 % per cycle in 1000 cycles, and a 8.06 mAh cm−2 areal capacity at a raised sulfur loading of 8.0 mg cm−2 in coin-cell configuration. Moreover, the corresponding pouch cells demonstrate decent workability at flexible scenario as well as stable cycling behavior under 3.5 mg cm−2 sulfur loading and electrolyte-to-sulfur (E/S) ratio of 9.5 μL mg−1.

Moreover, for PIBs anode, Fe7Se8@C nanotubes also exhibit outstanding rate behaviour and maintainable capacity 222 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 upon 500 cycles). The superior electrochemical performance of Fe7Se8@C nanotubes is ascribed to the unique structure, where the hierarchical hollow tubular characteristic of Fe7Se8@C composites can mitigate the volume expansion of Fe7Se8 and supply effective transmission paths for both Na+(K+) and electrons within repeated cycle processes, and additionally, N-doped carbon layer can further protect the integrality of Fe7Se8@C nanotubes from destruction within the cycle processes, and enhance electronic conductivity.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Encapsulation of Co/Co3O4 hetero-nanoparticles within the inner tips of N-doped carbon nanotubes: Engineering Mott-Schottky nanoreactors for efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocalysis toward flexible zinc-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of economical, efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of paramount importance for the substantial advancement of flexible and rechargeable metal-air batteries. The delicate manipulation of metal/semiconductor heterointerfaces represents a powerful leverage to boost the electrocatalytic performance due to the Mott-Schottky effect. Herein, we demonstrate a typical Mott-Schottky electrocatalyst by ingeniously encasing Co/Co3O4 hetero-nanoparticles within the inner tips of N-doped carbon nanotubes (abbreviated as Co/Co3O4@N-CNTs hereafter) through a facile and scalable hydrogel-bridged pyrolysis strategy. Experimental and theoretical findings collectively manifest that the spontaneous charge redistribution at the Co/Co3O4 heterointerfaces is essential to promote the charge transfer capability, lower down the reaction barriers for oxygen electrocatalysis, and ultimately boost the intrinsic activities. Accordingly, the well-designed Co/Co3O4@N-CNTs exhibit admirable ORR and OER activities and long-term robustness in KOH medium, exceeding the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, the Co/Co3O4@N-CNTs-assembled flexible all-solid-state zinc-air battery displays a high power density, remarkable rate capability, excellent rechargeablity and outstanding mechanical flexibility even under severe deformations, predicting the great potentials in diverse next-generation wearable electronic devices.

Organothiols for dual-interface modification of high performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as one of the most likely to be the next generation energy storage systems. However, the shuttle effect and interface instability of lithium metal anode plague their electrochemical performance. Researchers have made great efforts to solve these issues by introducing suitable electrolyte additives. Herein, we find a new electrolyte additive, Trithiocyanuric acid (TMT), greatly improving the Li-S battery electrochemical performance. The TMT decreases the polysulfides concentration in the electrolyte and inhibits the shuttle effect by changing the reaction pathway of active materials. Moreover, a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the lithium metal anode with TMT enables the Li/Cu cell with an overpotential of about 0.02 V at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 for over 500 h. Li-S batteries with TMT show an extremely high reversible capacity of 674.5 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 0.5C and a low capacity fading rate of 0.12% per cycle for 300 cycles. Most importantly, Li-S pouch cells (300 Wh kg−1) with TMT exhibit stable long cycle with a high specific capacity of 602 mAh g−1 after 170 cycles at 0.1C, which greatly promotes the practical applications of Li-S batteries. This work demonstrates that multi aspect modifying together can better realize high-performance Li-S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
In-situ construction of dual lithium-ion migration channels in polymer electrolytes for lithium metal batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are expected to play an important role in high-energy lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Unfortunately, SPEs suffer from inadequate room-temperature ionic conductivity and sluggish interfacial charge transport, which severely limit their widespread applications in LMBs. Herein, we in-situ construct dual lithium-ion migration channels based SPEs by combining ring-opening polymerization of 1,3-dioxolane and solid-state organic ionic plastic crystals. “Coordination-dissociation” with the oxygen atoms in polymer chain segments and fast ion migration inside the organic ionic plastic crystal are two migration modes formed in-situ to synergistically enhance the ionic conductivity and interfacial charge transfer of SPEs. As a result, the in-situ formed poly(1,3-dioxolane)-based solid electrolytes (PDEs) not only afford an integrated battery structure with stabilized electrodes/electrolyte interface but also achieve outstanding oxidation stability, uniform lithium deposition (greater than1200 h under 0.5 mAh cm−2 in symmetric Li cells). Based on PDEs, the Li-LiFePO4 batteries demonstrate excellent cycle stability (almost no capacity decay after 500 cycles under 2C at 25 °C) and a wide operating temperature (-15 ∼ 45 °C). Also, applications of PDEs in Li-LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 batteries further demonstrate the compatibility of PDE with high voltage battery systems. Our study provides a facile and practical approach for creating solid electrolytes that meet both the ionic conductivity and interfacial charge transport requirements for practical solid-state batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Laser-induced rapid construction of Co/N-doped honeycomb-like carbon networks as oxygen electrocatalyst used in zinc-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) template method is a general strategy for synthesising metal-nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts, especially in oxygen electrocatalysts. However, the traditional heat treatment method that transforms MOFs into carbon material requires high temperature, long preparation time, and a harsh gas environment. Herein, we reported a laser-induced carbonized strategy (LIC) that rapidly converts the MOFs into conductive carbon network structures in milliseconds ambient conditions. Interestingly, through LIC, the ZIF-67 derived Co/N-doped honeycomb-like carbon networks present a better bifunctional electrocatalyst performance than the carbon catalyst treated by the traditional carbonization process. This could ascribe to their high specific surface area (SSA) and unique honeycomb-like opening channel structure, which is beneficial for electrolyte storage and mass transfer process.

A biophotoelectrocatalytic system for pollutant removal based on carbon fiber cloth supported TiO2 photoanode with oxygen vacancy defects and CuO/g-C3N4 photocathode,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdAs an advanced oxidation technology, photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) has been widely explored to degrade refractory contaminants in the environment. Meanwhile, enzymatic biodegradation provides an effective approach to removal of organic pollutants under mild conditions. Herein, we developed a biophotoelectrocatalytic system to remove bisphenol A (BPA) based on the combination of PEC and enzymatic biodegradation. We utilized carbon fiber cloth (CFC) as substrate to construct a dual-photoelectrode biophotoelectrocatalytic system based on three dimensional (3D) nanostructured TiO2 photoanode with oxygen vacancy defects (Ov-TiO2/CFC) and enzyme-coupled CuO/g-C3N4/CFC photocathode. The excellent PEC performance of Ov-TiO2/CFC photoanode significantly promoted the formation of reactive radicals for the degradation reaction, ascribed to efficient separation and migration of photogenerated carriers. The proposed system displayed good synergistic effect between PEC and enzymatic catalysis for BPA removal, with more than 99% degradation efficiency after 90-min treatment.

The core of the NiCo2O4 nanowires forms the nanoarray backbone on carbon cloth while the shell of NiCo-LDH nanosheets extends the electrochemical active sites and generates mesoporous hierarchical channels to facilitate electron and ion transport. Therefore, with the optimized mass ratio of 1.9 between NiCo-LDH and NiCo2O4, such a core-shell structure enhanced the areal capacitance of the as-prepared NiCo2O4@NiCo-LDH electrode up to 6092 mF/cm2 (or areal capacity of 0.846 mAh/cm2 at 2 mA/cm2 for the battery type pseudocapacitor) and obtain high specific capacitance of 1882 F/g under 1 A/cm2. The capacity retention rate can maintain 83.9 % after 5000 cycles at 30 mA/cm2. Furthermore, an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled using NiCo2O4@NiCo-LDH//activated carbon. Such an ASC exhibits a very high energy density of 49 Wh/kg at the power density of 750 W/kg and retains 30 Wh/kg at 7500 W/kg. The ASC shows its excellent cycling stability by keeping 83.3 % of initial capacity retention rate after 2000 cycles under 5 A/g. The assembled flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor with NiCo2O4@NiCo-LDH//activated carbon exhibits good mechanical stability and high specific capacity of 157 F/g under 1 A/g. The significantly improved electrochemical properties demonstrates the practical applications of the core-shell structure of NiCo2O4@NiCo-LDH on carbon cloth for novel ASC configuration design and development of next energy storage devices.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Construction of frustrated Lewis pairs at N and Mo2C double sites boosts efficient electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe polysulfide shuttle effect and uncontrollable Li-dendrite growth on Li anode are the major reasons limiting the commercial development of Li-S batteries. Transition metal compounds on the carbon vector on the transition of polysulfides have been widely reported. However, there are few reports on the principle of simultaneous transformation and the effect of double active site spacing. Herein, we are based on the mechanism of the anchoring effect of doped elements on the carbon vector. Molybdenum carbide nanoparticles are mounted onto N-doped carbon nanosheets and coated on commercial separators (Mo2C-NCNS) for modification to satisfy the synchronization of S cathode and Li anode. The uniformly dispersed N element promotes the dispersion, homogenization and micro size regulation of Mo2C nanoparticles by anchoring Mo atoms. At the same time, the Mo2C site adjacent to N forms a spatially frustrated Lewis pairs with it. The reasonable spacing between them promotes the uniform deposition of lithium ions, the rapid transformation of polysulfides and the synchronous synergy between them. Characterization by XPS showed that using carbon as a bridge site further enhanced the strong metal-vector interaction between C3N4 and Mo2C, so as to improve the reaction kinetics. Thus, it has an initial specific capacity of 1186 mAh g−1 at 1C, and after 1000 cycles, 400 mAh g−1 remained, with a decay rate of only 0.06% per cycle. At a current density of 1 mA/cm2, the symmetric cell with Mo2C-NCNS modified separator exhibits steady cyclability over 1500 h, with a small overpotential of 76 mV.",Chemical Engineering Science

Oxidation mechanism of a near β-Ti alloy,"© 2022 The AuthorsNear β-Ti alloys, a perfect candidate material for numerous applications in the aerospace, are expected to exhibit high temperature endurability. Here, in order to evaluate the high temperature oxidation mechanism of the near β-Ti alloy, detailed microstructural characterization was performed on a near β-Ti alloy, Ti-55511 alloy after isothermal heat treatment at 600 °C in a tube furnace. Parabolic oxidation kinetics was observed. The oxide layer consisted of Al2O3, TiO2, VO2, and Magnéli phases. Polymorphic phase transformations and Magnéli phases played critical roles in the oxide layer thickening. The formation of defects was highly correlated with the incorporation of oxygen into Al2O3 and VO2, which resulted in lattice distortion of the oxides. Continuous oxidation led to the formation of the higher-valence oxide V2O5 in VO2 particles.",Materials and Design
Acetylene black interlayer regulated sulfur deposition for lithium-sulfur batteries with high utilization and long-term life,"© 2022Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered to be competitive next-generation energy storage systems. However, practical applications are limited due to the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the poor electronic conductivity of the sulfur cathode, especially at high-rate currents. Here, we applied commercialized Acetylene black (AB) as separator coating in Li-S batteries. The stacking of AB nanospheres forms a void space that can physically adsorb polysulfides, store electrolytes, and promote lithium-ion diffusion; Simultaneously, it forms an excellent electronic conduction network that significantly improves the utilization of higher-order LiPSs. The thickness and composition of the coating can regulate the nucleation of crystalline S and Li2S to promote the uniform deposition of solid-phase particles. AB-150 releases an initial capacity of 961.3 mAh g−1 and still maintains at 825 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 85.8% at 0.2C. Even remains at 371.2 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1C with a weak capacity decay rate of 0.06% per cycle. These understandings can also be extended to the design of polar/catalytic interlayer materials driving the large-scale application of Li-S batteries.",Electrochimica Acta

These carbon nanomaterials improve their attributes for unexpected properties and applications by doping with foreign atoms. Nitrogen‑phosphorus-codoped and functionalized carbon nanotube sponges (NP-CNTSs) were synthesized, using the aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) method. We used acetonitrile and triphenylphosphine (TPP) as nitrogen and phosphorus precursors. According to our results, the NP-CNTSs were formed by entangled multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) of diameters ranging between 60 and 300 nm with Fe2P and Fe3C nanoparticles in the walls and inside the carbon nanotube sponges (CNTSs) respectively. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) characterization revealed the vibrational modes of aromatic and aliphatic C[sbnd]H, P[dbnd]O, P[sbnd]H, and O[dbnd]C[sbnd]N bonds. The NP-CNTSs undergo a quasi-reversible hydroquinone/quinone redox process as revealed by cyclic voltammetry studies. They also efficiently retain organic solvents, absorbing up to 40 times their weight for dichlorobenzene. The XPS and Raman characterizations show the presence of pyridinic nitrogen, which might be responsible for the formation of cavities in the wall of the CNTSs and the entanglement of carbon nanotubes, which promotes the growth of the NP-CNTSs.

Modeling coupled electrochemical and mechanical behavior of soft ionic materials and ionotronic devices,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdRecently there has been an increase in demand for soft and biocompatible electronic devices capable of withstanding large stretch. Ionically conductive polymers present a promising class of soft materials for these emerging applications due to their ability to realize charge transport across the polymer network, while preserving the desired mechanical and chemical features.

Stable single layer structures of aluminum oxide: Vibrational and electronic characterization of magnetic phases,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The structural, magnetic, vibrational and electronic properties of single layer aluminum oxide (AlO2) are investigated by performing state-of-the-art first-principles calculations. Total energy optimization and phonon calculations reveal that aluminum oxide forms a distorted octahedral structure (1T′-AlO2) in its single layer limit. It is also shown that surfaces of 1T′-AlO2 display magnetic behavior originating from the O atoms. While the ferromagnetic (FM) state is the most favorable magnetic order for 1T′-AlO2, transformation to a dynamically stable antiferromagnetic (AFM) state upon a slight distortion in the crystal structure is also possible. It is also shown that Raman activities (350–400 cm−1) obtained from the vibrational spectrum can be utilized to distinguish the possible magnetic phases of the crystal structure. Electronically, both FM and the AFM phases are semiconductors with an indirect band gap and they can form a type-III vdW heterojunction with graphene-like ultra-thin materials. Moreover, it is predicted that presence of oxygen defects that inevitably occur during synthesis and production do not alter the magnetic state, even at high vacancy density.

Modulating eg orbitals through ligand engineering to boost the electrocatalytic activity of NiSe for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesAccelerating the sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by electrocatalysis is essential to achieve high performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. However, the issue of insufficient catalytic activity remains to be addressed. Herein, a strategy of modulating eg orbitals through ligand engineering has been proposed to boost the catalytic activity of NiSe for rapid LiPSs redox conversion. The X-ray spectroscopic measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that partial substitution of Se with N disrupts the octahedral coordination of Ni atoms in NiSe, leading to the reduced degeneracy and upward shift of eg orbitals of Ni 3d states. As a consequence, the bonding strength of N-substituted NiSe (N-NiSe) with LiPSs is enhanced, which facilitates the interfacial charge transfer kinetics and accelerates the LiPSs redox kinetics. Therefore, the Li-S batteries assembled with N-NiSe present a high capacity of 682.6 mAh g−1 at a high rate of 5 C and a high areal capacity of 6.5 mAh cm−2 at a high sulfur loading of 6 mg cm−2.

Herein, we construct MoP nanoparticles which are embedded in N-doped carbon hollow nanostructure (MoP@NC) as host with multiple synergistic mechanism to facilitate multiphase sulfur redox reaction kinetics, inhibit polysulfide shuttle and buffer the side effects of volume expansion in Li-S battery. In consequence, MoP@NC/S cathode shows a surprisingly discharge capacity of 1587 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, and a stable long cycle life over 1000 cycles at 1 C with low capacity loss of average 0.04% per cycle. The MoP@NC/S cathode effectively solves the essential problem and further promotes the commercialization of Li-S battery.",Separation and Purification Technology

Toward unveiling structure and property relationships from ionic ordering in Li/S battery electrolytes: Neutron total scattering and molecular dynamics simulations,"© 2022With their high energy density and environmental friendliness, lithium/sulfur (Li/S) batteries represent a promising candidate for the post-lithium-ion era. However, complex degradation mechanisms and a lack of microscopic insight into the molecular structure of the polysulfide (PS) and ether-based electrolyte materials have hindered the broad commercialization of this energy storage system so far. Here, neutron scattering experiments combined with electronic-continuum corrected molecular dynamics simulations of typical ether-based electrolytes for lithium/sulfur batteries were used to elucidate the complex electrolyte and PS structure. We find that a delicate balance between ion-ion and ion-solvent interactions steers the ordering and undesired clustering of Li+ and PS ions at moderate concentrations (> 1 M). In particular, ‘solvent-separated’ Li+ ions and PS/anions induce a cation and anion short-ranged alternating structure. At these moderate concentrations, we show the onset of the decoupling of diffusion processes of Li+ ions into caged and jump diffusions within the 3D TFSI− networks. Our study and the presented combination of methods are extendable to other electrolytes and compositions and provide a significant step forward in the modeling and understanding of next-generation battery materials.",Energy Storage Materials

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivative as electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Efficient storage of energy is the key to improving the utilization of clean energy. It is urgent to design and prepare a battery system with high specific volume, long cycle life, and fast charge–discharge characteristics. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivative materials have both the functional characteristics of metal ion host and organic ligand guest and have the advantages of large surface area, adjustable pores, structure, and composition. They can be directly applied, and they can be compounded to derive specific structural materials, showing unique advantages and application prospects in energy conversion and storage applications. This paper is mainly based on MOFs and their derivative materials, focusing on lithium-ion batteries with high specific energy, environmental friendliness, and large-scale energy storage. The optimization and application of MOFs and their derivatives in the microstructure and composition control of lithium-ion battery electrode materials are discussed in terms of preparation methods and battery performance, which is conducive to constructing electrode materials with abundant active sites and improving the charge transport movement of electrode materials.

Bamboo-shaped Co@NCNTs as superior sulfur host for Li-S batteries,"© 2022Functional and active carbon material is of great concern in facilitating the performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery. In this work, we develop a bamboo-like nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Co@NCNTs-2) with low cobalt metal content, which acts as not only the host matrix for sulfur loading but also an efficient catalyst for the adsorption and conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The characterization results show that the Co particles are mainly encapsulated inside the Co@NCNTs-2, and the N species are mainly distributed on the outer surface of Co@NCNTs-2. The Co particles are the growth sites of carbon nanotubes and are wrapped by carbon to form Co@NCNTs-2. It is confirmed that the uniform graphitized structure contributes to charge transfer, while the enriched N species assist the trap and catalytic conversion of the polysulfides, thus helping to restrain the shuttle effect. As a result, the resultant Co@NCNTs-2-S cathode presents high reversible capacity at different current densities and exhibits superior cycling stability for 300 cycles at 0.5 C.",Applied Surface Science
Hexamethylenetetramine-derived pyridinic N abundant porous carbon-supported Co/Co-Nx nanoparticles as highly efficient oxygen reduction catalyst and zinc-air battery cathode,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdFuel cells and metal-air batteries attracted extensive research attention owing to high power density, renewability, and environmental friendliness. Hence, developing heteroatom-doped pyridinic N abundant porous carbon materials with large surface area have an extensive effect on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cell and metal-air battery. Herein, high content of pyridinic N porous carbon-supported Co/Co-Nx nanoparticles were synthesized as ORR catalysts by carbonizing complexes of hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O with silica template. The HMT-Co@SiO2-900 with high content of pyridinic N, large specific surface area, and porous structure exhibits a more positive half-wave potential (0.85 V) than 20% Pt/C and the outstanding performance oxygen evolution reaction behavior. The low Tafel slope of HMT-Co@SiO2-900 revealed the faster reaction kinetics during ORR. The HMT-Co@SiO2-900 zinc-air battery showed a high excellent cyclic stability in continuous charge/discharge cycles for 420 times at 10 mA/cm2.

Superior indicative and regulative function of Fe doping amount for MnO2 catalyst with an oxygen vacancy in NH3-SCR reaction: A DFT + U study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.MnO2 was a promising catalyst in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reaction at low temperature. In this research, density functional theory calculations were carried out to evaluate the NH3-SCR performance of MnO2 catalyst with an oxygen vacancy (MnO2-x). Results demonstrated that MnO2-x became the thermodynamically most preferred structure after Fe doping, and its structure was kept stable as the doping amount increased. The adsorption behaviors of gaseous molecules on the MnO2-x showed that NH3 and H2O preferred to be adsorbed on the Mn Lewis acid sites, while NO and SO2 preferred O sites. Good SO2-tolerance also exhibited in MnO2-x for its enhanced acidity after Fe doping. Moreover, outstanding linear relationships were emerged in doping ratio with oxygen vacancy formation energy and adsorption energy, suggesting its important role in the balance of redox and acidity properties. Thermodynamic calculation results confirmed the inhibitory effect of temperature on adsorption and found the implication of doping amount to H2O-tolerance. Overall, Fe2-MnO2-x catalyst performed best in our work. Strong indication of doping amount was found by further calculations of four physical quantities. In general, doping amount was an outstanding indicator to reflect the characteristics of catalysts, and can be employed in the future directional catalyst designs.",Applied Surface Science
Microrods-evolved WO3 nanospheres with enriched oxygen-vacancies anchored on dodecahedronal CoO(Co2+)@carbon as durable catalysts for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) play the vital roles in energy-conversion devices, especially for Zn-air batteries (ZABs). However, it is always a challenge to explore a stable bifunctional catalyst. Here, WO3-anchored ZIF-67-derived CoO@graphitized carbon is wrapped by a thin carbon-layer to obtain CoO@GC/WO3@CL catalysts. The well-crystallized WO3 nanospheres are evolved from WO3 microrods via an intra-particle maturation. For ORR, the peak-potential of CoO@GC/WO3@CL-800 (800 ℃) (0.81 V vs. RHE) is higher than that of Pt/C (0.79 V). Synergies between WO3 (oxygen vacancies) and CoO (Co2+) improve mass/charge transfer to boost the 4e− pathway. For OER, CoO@GC/WO3@CL-800 has a lower overpotential (330 mV) than RuO2 (490 mV) at 10 mA cm−2. The O2 evolution rate can reach 0.125 mmol s−1 with a high Faraday efficiency of 96.7 %. Cooperation between CoOOH and oxygen vacancies promotes the H2O-oxidation to boost the O2-generation. A relatively low ΔE [Ej=10(OER)-E1/2(ORR)] of 0.72 V confirms the highly-stable ORR/OER activities of CoO@GC/WO3@CL-800, which obtains a higher power density (138 mW cm−2) than Pt/C + RuO2 cathode in primary ZABs. This study indicates a new direction to build a multilayer-structured ORR/OER catalyst by using ZIFs as templates.",Applied Surface Science
Nickel-induced charge redistribution in Ni-Fe/Fe3C@nitrogen-doped carbon nanocage as a robust Mott-Schottky bi-functional oxygen catalyst for rechargeable Zn-air battery,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Designing earth-abundant and advanced bi-functional oxygen electrodes for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are extremely urgent but still ambiguous. Thus, metal-semiconductor nanohybrids were developed with functionally integrating ORR-active Ni species, OER-active Fe/Fe3C components, and multifunctional N-doped carbon (NDC) support. Expectantly, the resulted NDC nanocage embedded with Ni-Fe alloy and Fe3C particles, as assembled Mott-Schottky-typed catalyst, delivered a promoted half-wave potential of 0.904 V for ORR and a low overpotential of 315 mV at 10 mA/cm2 for OER both in alkaline media, outperforming those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2 counterparts. Most importantly, the optimized Ni-Fe/Fe3C@NDC sample also afforded a peak power density of 267.5 mW/cm2 with a specific capacity of 773.8 mAh/gZn and excellent durability over 80 h when used as the air electrode in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, superior to the state-of-the-art bi-functional catalysts. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the introduction of Ni into the Fe/Fe3C@NDC component could well manipulate the electronic structure of the designed electrocatalyst, leading to an effective built-in electric field established by the Mott-Schottky heterojunction to expedite the continuous interfacial charge-transfer and thus significantly promote the utilization of electrocatalytic active sites. Therefore, this work provides an avenue for the designing and developing robust and durable Mott-Schottky-typed bi-functional catalysts for promising energy conversion.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Recent progresses of metal-organic framework-based materials in electrochemical energy storage,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdBatteries and supercapacitors have become the two most important technologies in the forefront of the electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems due to their important roles in hybrid vehicles, portable electronic devices, and unmanned aerial vehicles.

Furthermore, the universal design principle of MOF-based materials for EES system is extracted, in the hope of establishing a roadmap for the design of materials.",Materials Today Sustainability
Interfacial charge and surface defect regulation for high-efficiency CdIn2S4-based photoanodes,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.As an n-type narrow band gap ternary sulfide semiconductor, CdIn2S4 exhibits favourable photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. However, severe photogenerated carrier recombination and slow surface dynamics at the interface of monomer CdIn2S4 restrict its application. Herein, we addressed the problem by fabricating a TiO2/CdIn2S4-annealed photoanode by two-step anodization method, hydrothermal method and annealing treatment. As a result, the TiO2/CdIn2S4-annealed photoanode exhibited 6.21 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was much higher than the pure CdIn2S4 (0.05 mA/cm2) and TiO2 (0.14 mA/cm2), and was 9 times higher than TiO2/CdIn2S4 (0.68 mA/cm2). This excellent performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of interfacial charge regulation (introducing TiO2 NTs as electron transport layer) and surface defect regulation (introducing sulfur vacancies as OER active centers to facilitate hole transport). By this way, the photogenerated electrons and holes of CdIn2S4 were simultaneously extracted in opposite directions. Experimental characterizations confirmed the introduction of TiO2 and sulfur vacancies can enhance the separation and injection efficiency of carriers. This work provides a new idea for regulating interface charges and surface defects to improve the PEC activity of CdIn2S4.",Applied Surface Science
Preparation of Flaky Hexagonal Nanoporous Au-Cu and Au Particles via Dealloying,"© 2022, The Chinese Society for Metals (CSM) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Nanoporous metals have attracted significant attention owing to their excellent physical, chemical, and biological properties. However, preparing ultrafine nanoporous metal particles (1–5 μm) with specific geometries remains challenging. Herein, we report a simple strategy to prepare ultrafine flaky hexagonal nanoporous Au-Cu and Au particles via dealloying. Mg-based alloy ribbons with ultrafine flaky hexagonal Mg-Au(Cu)-Gd particles dispersed in a Mg-Cu(Au)-Gd metallic glassy matrix were prepared. The size and morphology of the precipitated flaky hexagonal Mg-Au(Cu)-Gd particles were controlled by the solidification process of a Mg61Cu21Au7Gd11 alloy melt. Ultrafine flaky hexagonal nanoporous Au-Cu particles (diagonal diameter 2.58 ± 0.44 μm, ligament size ~ 28 nm), Au-1 particles (diagonal diameter 2.38 ± 0.35 μm, ligament size ~ 83 nm) and Au-2 particles (diagonal diameter 2.39 ± 0.44 μm, ligament size ~ 66 nm) were prepared via ultrasonic-assisted dealloying of Mg61Cu21Au7Gd11 alloy ribbons in 0.25 M HCl/ethanol, 1 M HCl/ethanol and 0.25 M HNO3/ethanol solutions, respectively. The ultrafine flaky hexagonal nanoporous Au-Cu and Au particles with a large specific surface area have a uniform particle size and shape, implying that they possess adequate powder fluidity and excellent catalytic properties. Moreover, the formation mechanism of the MgAu(Cu)Gd phase in solidified Mg-Cu-Au-Gd alloys was discussed. This study provides a novel approach for synthesizing nanoporous metal particles with a specific geometry.",Acta Metallurgica Sinica (English Letters)

In particular, the mechanism and key parameters of each etching strategy on various MOFs are fully discussed, followed by the utilization of etched MOFs and etched MOF-derived materials in diverse applications. Finally, current challenges and research directions for the further development of etching MOFs are proposed.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Defect engineering tuning electron structure of biphasic tungsten-based chalcogenide heterostructure improves its catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution and triiodide reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The design and exploration of high-efficiency and low-cost electrode catalysts are of great significance to the development of novel energy conversion technologies. In this work, metal and nonmetal heteroatoms co-doped biphasic tungsten-based chalcogenide heterostructured catalyst (Co-WS2/P-WO2.9) with rich defects is successfully synthesized by a vulcanization technique. The electrocatalytic performance of WS2/WO3 in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and triiodide reduction reaction is significantly enhanced by modifying and optimizing its electronic structure through a defect engineering strategy. As an electrocatalyst for HER, the optimized Co-WS2/P-WO2.9 exhibits a low overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 of 146 and 120 mV with small Tafel slopes of 86 and 74 mV dec−1 in alkaline and acidic electrolyte, respectively. In addition, a Co-WS2/P-WO2.9 assembled solar cell yields a short circuit current density of 15.85 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.74 V, a fill factor of 0.66, and a competitive power conversion efficiency (7.83%), which is comparable or higher than conventional Pt-based solar cell (16.02 mA cm−2, 0.70 V, 0.63, 7.14%). The formation of a heterostructure in Co-WS2/P-WO2.9 leads to the presence of a built-in electric field in the interfacial region between Co-WS2 and P-WO2.9, which leads to an increased open-circuit voltage from 0.70 V for Pt to 0.74 V for Co-WS2/P-WO2.9. This work can provide a technical support for developing high-performance heterostructured catalysts, which open up a way for improving catalytic performance of heterostructured catalysts in the field of electrocatalysis.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Prussian blue analogue/KB-derived Ni/Co/KB composite as a superior adsorption-catalysis separator modification material for Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Lithium‑sulfur batteries (LSBs) are gradually replacing conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), credited to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and non-toxicity. Nevertheless, the substantial capacity degradation caused by the polysulfide shuttling during charging and discharging has seriously hindered the commercialization of LSBs. Separator modification with functionalized carbon materials has been found to catalyze the breakdown of polysulfides, thereby improving the efficiency of LSBs. Herein, we synthesized Ni/Co-PBAs with KB structures to subsequently derive Ni/Co/KB composites by a carbonization process, which were later used as a modifier layer on the barrier in LSBs in order to effectively alleviate the shuttle problem. The capacity of the Ni/Co/KB composite decorated separator is found to be 1032 mAh/g at 0.5 C with a coulombic efficiency closer to 100%. In the long-term cycling capability evaluation, the initial cycle is approximately 802.9 mAh/g at 1 C, while capacity retention after 400 cycles is also 678.8 mAh/g, with a high-capacity retention rate of 84.5%.

Reconfiguring the interface charge of Co@Carbon polyhedron for enhanced capacitive deionization,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, the Co-metal organic framework (ZIF-67) is employed as the template to prepare 3D mesoporous Co@carbon polyhedron (Co@CP) for capacitive deionization (CDI) anodes with improved salt removal capacity. The as-prepared Co@CP exhibits a novel dodecahedron structure with abundant nanopores and embeds with Co nanoparticles which are uniformly distributing on the carbon skeleton. Such structure not only enhances the conductivity and structural durability of the whole electrode, but also provides a convenient transport channel for ions/electrons and thereby promoting the desalination kinetics. Remarkably, the reversible electrochemical conversion between the Co0 to some extent improves the storage of Na+, accompanied by the desalination/regeneration. Regarding the preparation, as the temperature increased from 600 to 800℃, the dominant particle size rises from 5 to 7 nm to 12–18 nm. The density functional theory calculation features that the conductivity and charge transport ability of Co@CP can be reinforced by optimizing the Co-C interface. Accordingly, the charge density difference simulation demonstrates that the Co doping and the existence of defects benefits to generate great potential active sites, leading to the enhanced adsorption of Na+. As a result, the optimized Co@CP possesses the large pore volume, high degree of graphitization and large specific surface area (515.6 m2/g). Towards the desalination, the highest desalination capacity reaches to 47.8 mg/g in 1000 μS/cm NaCl at 1.2 V with adsorption rate of 3.28 mg/g/min.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Confined Co9S8 nanocrystals into N/S-Co-doped carbon nanofibers as a chainmail-like electrocatalyst for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries with high sulfur loading,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Accelerating phase transposition efficiency of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) to L2S and hampering the solution of LiPSs are the keys to stabilizing lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Hence, the sulfiphilic ultrafine Co9S8 nanoparticles embedded lithiophilic N, S co-doping carbon nanofibers (Co9S8/NSCNF) are prepared via the dual-template method, which are then used as sulfur host in Li-S batteries. Particularly, the double active sites (Co9S8 and N, S) in Co9S8/NSCNF are prone to form “Co-S”, “Li-O” or “Li-N” bonds, and then simultaneously improving the chemisorption and interface transposition capability of LiPSs. In case of the S@ Co9S8/NSCNF composites with high sulfur loading of 89% are employed as cathode, the cell possesses optimized “sulfiphilicity” and “lithiophilicity”, which achieves remarkable sulfur electrochemistry, including outstanding reversibility of 816.8 mAh g−1 over 500 cycles at 1.0 C, excellent rate property of 742.2 mAh g-1at 5.0 C, and long-term cycling with a low attenuation of 0.011% per cycle over 1800 cycles at 3.0 C. Impressively, a remarkable areal capacity of 11.51 mAh cm−2 is retained under the sulfur loading of 15.3 mg cm−2 for 50 cycles.

Mechanistic insights into the formation of surface oxygen vacancies with controllable concentration and long-term stability in small-molecule bonded bismuth-based semiconductor hybrid photocatalyst,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Constructing oxygen vacancies (OVs) with desired concentration and stability on the surfaces of semiconductors has been demonstrated to be a powerful tactic to enhance their photocatalytic performances. Nevertheless, forming OVs usually requires rigorous conditions, and OVs harshly suffer from deactivation during photoreaction. Herein, a facile strategy is developed to introduce surface OVs with tunable concentrations and long-term stability in bismuth-based semiconductors (BBS) through organic small-molecule surface-bonding. Taking I-doped BiOCl (I-BiOCl) as a model photocatalyst and catechol and its derivatives as ligands, a series of organic/I-BiOCl bonded hybrid photocatalysts are successfully synthesized. Compared with I-BiOCl, hybrid photocatalysts exhibited substantially enhanced catalytic activity toward multiple contaminants removal. Experimental characterizations and DFT calculations reveal a strong interfacial interaction between organic ligands and BBS through the formation of Bi[sbnd]O[sbnd]C bonds, which lengthen Bi-O bonds within [Bi2O2]2+ structural units and reduce the formation energy of OVs, facilitating the escape of lattice O atoms and thus producing abundant surface OVs. More importantly, the concentration of OVs can be easily regulated by controlling the number of organic ligands, and the OVs exhibit high stability during photoreaction, attributing to the existence of high-valence-state Bi(3+x)+ that is near the OVs, which would not be re-oxidized by oxidative species like the low-valence-state Bi(3-x)+, that is, they would not be reset to original Bi3+. As a verification of its universality, the surface bonded strategy has been successfully extended to other BBS.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
A bifunctional interlayer fabricated by FeS2-embedded N-doped carbon nanocages with efficient polysulfide trapping-catalyzing capability for robust Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Shuttling behavior and sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are fundamental reasons that impede the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, a novel FeS2-embedded N-doped carbon (FeS2-NC) nanocage is reported as a separator coating material to alleviate these problems. It is also for the first time that FeS2 is applied to the separator coating of LSBs. The yolk-pleat-shell structure of FeS2-NC was synthesized via the pyrolysis of iron complexes prepared by Schiff base condensation and subsequent sulfurization treatment. The large internal space of FeS2-NC not only physically confines LiPSs but also forms a high-speed electron–ion transport network in cooperation with the highly polar compound FeS2, providing abundant chemical adsorption and catalytic sites for fast conversions of LiPSs. Theoretical calculation further confirms that FeS2 has strong adsorption energy for both Li2S6 and Li2S8, while in-situ Raman analysis also reveals the interaction between FeS2 and LiPSs. In addition, coin cells with the light functional separator (coating loading: 0.2 mg cm−2) have a ultrahigh initial capacity of 1613.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and a satisfactory cyclability of 652.3 mAh g−1 at 1C over 600 cycles with an attenuation rate of 0.049% per cycle. Even the high-sulfur-loaded (2.73 mg cm−2) pouch cell release a lasting high areal capacity of 2.38 mAh cm−2 at 0.4C. These results demonstrate that FeS2-NC has the efficient capability as polysulfide trapping-catalyzing nanoreactor for LSBs application.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Focus on using nanopore technology for societal health, environmental, and energy challenges","© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.With an increasing global population that is rapidly ageing, our society faces challenges that impact health, environment, and energy demand. With this ageing comes an accumulation of cellular changes that lead to the development of diseases and susceptibility to infections. This impacts not only the health system, but also the global economy. As the population increases, so does the demand for energy and the emission of pollutants, leading to a progressive degradation of our environment. This in turn impacts health through reduced access to arable land, clean water, and breathable air. New monitoring approaches to assist in environmental control and minimize the impact on health are urgently needed, leading to the development of new sensor technologies that are highly sensitive, rapid, and low-cost. Nanopore sensing is a new technology that helps to meet this purpose, with the potential to provide rapid point-of-care medical diagnosis, real-time on-site pollutant monitoring systems to manage environmental health, as well as integrated sensors to increase the efficiency and storage capacity of renewable energy sources.

However, the preparation of related carbon materials is energy-consuming and tedious. Herein, by directly using spent graphite (SG) from the spent LIBs without complex treatment as a substrate, a SG/S cathode has been prepared for lithium-sulfur batteries for the first time. Repeated charge/discharge cycles bring the SG surface not only rich functional polar groups, but also metal elements like Ni, Co and Mn through the dissolution of active cathode materials (in LIBs). These factors increase the conductivity, and efficiently promote the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) conversion kinetics in a way that the SG effectively adsorbs and fixes LiPS to reduce the shuttle effect in lithium sulfur batteries. Additionally, the SG/S cathode with high sulfur content of 78.4% has obtained an initial discharge capacity of 1377 mAh g−1 at the rate of 0.2 C with an excellent cycling stability. Even after 500 cycles, the cathode specific capacity remains as high as 765 mAh g−1 with a low average decay rate (0.006% per cycle) at 0.5 C. This work not only realizes the re-utilization of spent graphite, but also fabricates lithium-sulfur batteries with excellent electrochemical performances.",Carbon
Tuning the adsorption and diffusion capabilities of titanium disulfide monolayers by doping and strain engineering: Implications for lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Doping and strain engineering are effective tuning approaches for improving the electrochemical performance of materials in batteries and catalytic applications. This work investigates the adsorption and diffusion properties of lithium (Li) atoms on two-dimensional (2D) titanium disulfide (TiS2) using first-principles calculations. This work also investigates the effects of strain and heteroatom doping with manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), and copper (Cu) on the performance of 2D TiS2 and the prospects for its use in Li-ion batteries. Compared to other 2D materials such as VS2 and MoS2, our findings reveal that pristine TiS2 has a strong Li-ion adsorption energy of −2.03 eV, which improves to −2.07 eV and −2.62 eV by strain and doping, respectively. While no noticeable decrease in the diffusion energy barrier of the material is observed due to strain, the substitution of Ti with Co atoms results in a considerable reduction in the energy barrier from 0.19 eV to 0.12 eV. We also observed a dramatic enhancement of the open circuit voltage by ∼43% when a tensile strain of 4% is applied, and by ∼54% when the Co doping concentration is increased to 22.2%. The results indicate that 2D TiS2 is a potential contender for battery anodes as well as electrocatalytic applications, with doping and strain engineering further enhancing the properties of the material.",Applied Surface Science
Sb-etching-doping engineering TiSe2@C core–shell with low polarization effect enabling enhanced lithium storage performance,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The critical challenge of TiSe2 anode for lithium-ion battery (LIB) lies in the severe polarization due to the accumulation of excessive lithium ions and Li3TiSe2 phase during charge/discharge process, resulting in reduced active sites and sluggish interfacial transport kinetics. To solve the issues, Sb doped TiSe2@C core–shell is synthesized via a combined ion etching-doping route. During the process, the introduced Sb element in MIL-125 triggers a synergistic etching-ion exchanging reaction, leading to a structure change of TiSe2 from bulk to core–shell as well as homogeneous Sb-doping in TiSe2. The unique structure demonstrates nano-crystallization of bulk TiSe2 and the formation of local built-in electric field, providing enough achievable active sites and enhancing interfacial charge/ion transfer kinetics. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of structural engineering and electronic structural engineering, polarization effect is weakened and pseudocapacitance storage ability is improved, leading to the high specific capacity and cycle stability of 502 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. Therefore, the synthetic route of Sb doped TiSe2@C core–shell anode can be extended to related nanostructured systems for high performance energy storage device application.",Applied Surface Science
"Tailoring microstructure, mechanical and tribological properties of amorphous CNx films by incorporating Fe","© 2022Amorphous carbon nitride (α-CNx) films are perfect protective materials for advanced tribological application due to low coefficients of friction and chemical stability. However, their lower nano-hardness and poor degree of graphitization during sliding, result in the limited lubrication effect and inevitable wear, which greatly limits its wider potential for protective films. Herein, α-CNx/Fe films were constructed at different deposition temperatures by magnetron sputtering. The results indicated that the α-CNx/Fe film deposited at 600 °C has the highest hardness of ~27.3 GPa (2.13 times that of the pure α-CNx film), which is mainly attributed to the high sp3/sp2 carbon ratio. Besides, the Fe[sbnd]N bond of the film can induce the formation of self-lubricating tribofilm on the worn surface, which leads to low friction coefficient (μ = 0.18) of the α-CNx/Fe film during sliding, only 46 % of pure α-CNx films. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectra, and Electron energy loss spectra further confirmed that most of the tribofilm on the worn surface is composed of graphitized onion-like carbon structure scrolls, which is the critical factor for the decrease of friction coefficient. These results demonstrated that the obtained CNx/Fe films have excellent lubrication characteristics, providing guidance for CNx-based films in advanced precision machining and tribological applications.",Surface and Coatings Technology

The deficiency of rational strategies to solve the issues of intrinsic activity, synergistic sites deficiency, and structural simplicity for TMSes restricts their application in LIBs. Herein, a hierarchical multi-metal (Fe, Co) modified nanorod-like selenide with nitrogen-coordinated porous carbon support (CoFeSe/NC) is synthesized to intensify the intrinsic activity and structural stability of the derived material via a well-designed Fe-doped ZnCo-based multi-metal organic framework as a precursor. Profiting from the synergistic effect of the N-coordinated porous carbon support, multi-metal components, and well-retained integrated architecture, the CoFeSe/NC anodes exhibit exceptional electrochemical performances with a discharge capacity retention of 775 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.2 A g−1 and ultralong cycling stability (423 mAh g−1 at 3 A g−1 up to 1000 cycles). Further detailed kinetic analysis and in situ and ex situ characterizations indicate the improved electrochemical kinetics compared to the single-metal selenides and elucidate the lithium storage mechanism of the CoFeSe/NC anodes.

2D metal–organic frameworks and their derivatives for the oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical half reaction for energy conversion and storage technologies such as water electrolysis, rechargeable metal–air batteries, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and so on. Unfortunately, large overpotential is needed to overcome the sluggish kinetics of OER. With ultra-thin thickness, large specific surface area, rich and adjustable pore structure, and well-defined metal centers, two dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely investigated for OER. By virtue of the desirable chemical composition and diverse structural type, 2D MOFs are also employed as precursors and sacrificial templates to prepare metal-decorated porous carbon, metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal sulfides, metal phosphides, and so on. These 2D MOFs derivatives with high surface area and abundant metal sites exhibit excellent OER performance. Herein, the current advances on 2D MOFs and their derivatives as (pre)electrocatalysts are summarized, including the synthetic strategy and OER performance.

Boosting the overall electrochemical water splitting performance of pentlandites through non-metallic heteroatom incorporation,"© 2022 The Author(s)We report on synthesis of the heterotrimetallic pentlandite-type material Fe3Co3Ni3S8 (FCNS) in presence of suitable phosphorus-(FCNSP) and nitrogen-(FCNSN) donors for the overall electrochemical water splitting. Throughout the experiments, a preferential incorporation of N into the FCNS-lattice is observed whereas the addition of phosphorus generally leads to metal-phosphate-FCNS composites. The obtained FCNSP, FCNSN, and FCNSNP facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 100 mAcm−2 in 1.0M KOH with overpotentials of 479, 440, and 427 mV, respectively, outperforming the benchmark IrO2 (564 mV) and commercial Ni metal powder (>600 mV). Likewise, FCNSN and FCNSNP reveal an improved performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5M H2SO4, outperforming the pristine FCNS. All materials revealed high stability and morphological robustness during OER and HER. Notably, DFT calculation suggests that N and P doping boost the OER activity of the pristine FCNS, whereas N doping enhances the HER activity.",iScience
Efficient electrochemical hydrogen peroxide generation using TiO2/rGO catalyst and its application in electro-Fenton degradation of methyl orange,"© 2022It is very important to develop efficient and noble-metal-free catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to satisfy the commercial demand of H2O2. Herein, a reduced graphene oxidation (rGO) supported TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2/rGO) composite was synthesized for ORR by a sol-gel process followed by hydrothermal reduction. The SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman and XPS were used to characterize the TiO2/rGO and the results showed that TiO2 particles were uniformly embedded in the three-dimensional structure of rGO. The ORR process on TiO2/rGO was dominated by two-electron transfer, indicating the generation of hydrogen peroxide. The optimized TiO2/rGO catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity towards H2O2 electro-generation in acid solution with a H2O2 accumulated concentration of 41.69 mg/L and current efficiency of 8.21 % after 120 min of electrolysis. The activity of TiO2/rGO was also investigated as electro-Fenton catalyst for the degradation of methyl orange (MO). The MO and COD removal efficiencies at TiO2/rGO cathode reached 98.40 % and 85.14 %, respectively after 120 min of electrolysis. Free radical capture and quenching experiments showed the •OH played a vital role for the MO degradation in electro-Fenton process. Furthermore, the possible degradation pathway of MO was proposed by analyzing the intermediates. This work demonstrated that the prepared TiO2/rGO is a promising catalyst for H2O2 electro-generation.",Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects
Tuned-Potential Covalent organic framework Electrochemiluminescence platform for lutetium analysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a novel class of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) materials on account of its highly tunable structure and versatile properties. However, decoding the ECL property and its luminophor structure to improve the luminous performance remains challenging, which hinders its deeper development and wider application. Herein, by condensing triphenylarene aldehydes with varying number of nitrogen atoms with 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene-1,3,5-tricarbonitrile, a series of COFs were prepared to regulate the ECL potential, opening up a new way to precisely improve ECL performance. The electron and spatial changes in the precursor are transferred to the generated COFs skeleton, resulting in a progressively decrease in the reduction potential and a gradual increase intensity in ECL with the precise increase of nitrogen content in the skeleton. Introduction of nitrogen into COFs brings electrocatalysis and planarization of the framework for more efficiently carrier transport. The conclusion is confirmed by optical, electrical tests, as well as density functional theory calculations. As a proof-of-methodology, an ECL method was developed for the selective determination of lutetium ion with a detection limit as low as 1.6 nM (S/N = 3). This work exhibits that the advanced potential-tunable ECL-COFs can be obtained accurately and easily through design structure at the molecular level, which is expected to promote the exploration of the relationship between ECL potential and framework structure, and further apply to environment-related sensing analysis.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
Rational design of dual catalysts towards efficient polysulfides conversion for high performance Li–S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and high energy density. However, severe active materials losing and capacity decay caused by shuttle effect restrict its practical application. Inspired by bipolar magnet, here we proposed dual catalysts embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon with different polar sites towards efficient lithium polysulfides conversion. The dual catalysts are composed of interlacing metal Co and Eu2O3 particles, in which the electronegative O2− in Eu2O3 and Co metal sites synergistically accelerate intermediates conversion. With this rational design, the cathode delivered an areal capacity of about 2.6 mAh cm−2 at the current rate of 1C during 100 cycles with the sulfur areal loading of 4.2 mg cm−2. Furthermore, the cathode could deliver a reversible capacity over 1000 mAh g−1 at 0.5C, and performed an excellent rate and cycling stability.",Journal of Power Sources
Thermoresponsive MXene composite system with high adsorption capacity for quick and simple removal of toxic metal ions from aqueous environment,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.High-performance adsorption and easy-to-recycle property of adsorbents are desirable in wastewater treatment, and a suitably smart adsorbent with responsive phase separation capacity is promising in this regard. Herein, a thermoresponsive composite system is designed through the combination of transition metal carbides (MXene) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) for removal of toxic metal ions from water. As a thermoresponsive switch, the PNIPAM endows such composite system with superior thermoresponsiveness (i.e., gel-water phase separation) in water, which facilitates to the control of adsorption. The gel phase triggered by an elevated temperature (e.g., 40 °C) quickly adsorbs toxic metal ions, and then a solid-liquid extraction way is used to conveniently separated the gel phase from water phase for simple removal of toxic metal ions. A very high adsorption capacity (e.g., ~224 mg·g−1 for Cu2+) can be achieved due to the synergistic effects of the composite system. Moreover, the separated gel can be back to a redispersed state at low temperature (e.g., 20 °C), enabling its effective regeneration and recovery. Notably, the PNIPAM as a protective agent prevents the oxidation of MXene so as to retain good stability during the multiple adsorption/desorption cycles. This simple and smart adsorption strategy is great promising for water purification application.",Journal of Hazardous Materials
A review of Li-ion batteries for autonomous mobile robots: Perspectives and outlook for the future,"© 2022 The AuthorsThe development of advanced autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) is essential for achieving the flexible work environment necessary for smart manufacturing. Complex perception, locomotion and navigation systems comprised of many sensors and powerful processors allow AMRs to continuously monitor their surroundings and internal systems. AMRs that can move freely around an industrial facility are increasingly required for 24/7 industrial processes. The energy requirements of AMRs can include the need for high power for tasks such as lifting and transporting as well as low power for the various onboard sensors. Total operating time between charges is dependent on factors such as distance travelled, payload power consumption, payload/cargo mass and AMR attachments such as tilt trays or robotic arms. This review discusses pre-existing commercial AMRs, their power consumption and compares the specifications of battery packs which are being used in the current generation of AMRs. This is followed by a detailed discussion about lithium-ion battery operation and recommendations for cathode and anode materials to replace traditionally used electrode materials to meet the growing power demands of next generation AMRs in the short to medium term (5–10 years) and in the long term (10+ years).",Journal of Power Sources
From S-rich polyphenylene sulfide to honeycomb-like porous carbon with ultrahigh specific surface area as bifunctional electrocatalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdPorous carbon materials possessing high specific surface area (SSA) are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. However, it is difficult to synthesize porous carbon with high SSA and endow them with high catalytic activity. Herein, Fe, N, S co-doped honeycomb-like porous carbon (Fe–N/S-HPC) with ultrahigh SSA (2223.31 m2 g−1) was achieved through a combined process of KOH activation and pyrolysis using S-rich polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) fibers as precursors. The ultrahigh SSA of Fe–N/S-HPC greatly increases the electrode/electrolyte contact area, while the introduction of heteroatoms (Fe, N, and S) as highly efficient active centers enables the efficient catalytic activity of Fe–N/S-HPC. Notably, the introduced metal presents a unique core-shell structure in Fe–N/S-HPC, with FexOySz as the shell and FexNySz as the core, which can great improve the catalytic activity and durability. Under alkaline conditions, the Fe–N/S-HPC catalyst exhibited outstanding bifunctional oxygen catalytic performance and facilitates the practical application of rechargeable Zn-air batteries. This study not only provides a solution for the rational utilization of PPS fiber waste does not decompose in nature, but also provides new insights for the construction of ultrahigh SSA porous carbon that is needed for industrial applications of rechargeable Zn-air batteries.",Carbon

However, the shuttle effect from the weak adsorption, poor diffusion-transfer, and insufficient catalytic site restrains further applications. Herein, the yolk-double shells hierarchical N-doped carbon nanospheres (NCS@C-800) were designed as an electrochemical nanoreactor, the material consists of high-content N-doped core-shell carbon nanospheres and a highly graphitized outer carbon shell, which has a gradient of N content. The unique structure host has many advantages, such as huge internal voids, ordered pore structure, and high electrical conductivity. In addition to the introduction of the N element, which offered a large number of adsorption and catalytic sites. Therefore, the NCS@C-800 effectively addresses the three above primary issues for constructing high performance Li–S. The results show that at 500 cycles at 1 C, the as-prepared material is 649 mAh g−1, while at 1000 cycles at 2 C it is 400 mAh g−1, with ultra-low capacity decays of 0.055% and 0.051% per cycle, respectively. More importantly, with an increase in S loading up to 5.43 mg cm−2, it still maintained excellent cycling stability. This work offered an effective strategy for high-performance Li–S batteries.",Carbon
Metal-ion inserted vanadium oxide nanoribbons as high-performance cathodes for aqueous zinc-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The current energy and environmental crises are driving the burgeoning demand for efficient and reliable energy storage devices. Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are currently considered to be promising candidates because of their excellent safety in operation and low cost. However, the real-world application of ZIBs has been impeded by a lack of cost effective cathode materials with the requisite high capacities and stability. Here we report the preparation and relevant properties of a special class of layered materials, which can be described as metal ion-inserted vanadium oxide (MVO, M = Zn, K, Na, and Ca) nanoribbons, as cathode materials for ZIBs. Metal ions are inserted into vanadium oxide by mixing the respective metal chloride with V2O5 particles in aqueous solution at room temperature, resulting in layered MVOs with expanded interlayer spaces. When used as the cathode material for ZIBs, ZnVO nanoribbons delivered specific capacities of 414.8, 368.6, 318.2, 271.2, 225.8 and 163.5 mAh g−1 at current rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively. Also, a capacity of 409.6 mAh g−1 was retained after current rate was returned to 0.1 A g−1. After cycling at 2 A g−1 for 1500 cycles, 84.4% of the initial capacity was retained, much higher than that possible using pristine V2O5. The synthesis strategy can be easily scaled up to a 10-liter reaction scale, demonstrating its potential for the large scale production of cathode materials for high-performance aqueous ZIBs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
MOF-derived porous nitrogen and phosphorus codoped carbon nanosheets: An emerging material for constructing robust electrochemical sensing platform,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Synthesizing novel MOFs derived carbon-based materials and investigating their sensing application own important scientific significance. In this work, Zn-MOF (ZIF-8) derived porous carbon with different dimension and atoms doping were facilely prepared via simple MOFs routes. Compared with the widely studied ZIF-8 derived three-dimensional porous N-doped carbon polyhedron frames (N-doped CPF), the two-dimensional porous N-doped carbon nanosheets (N-doped CNS) displayed remarkably enhanced electrochemical sensing performance for its stronger electron transfer ability. On the basis of N-doped carbon materials, the introduction of heteroatom P was also confirmed to be able to further boost their electrochemical activity for the promoted electrochemically active specific surface and interface interaction with the target molecules. As a result, ZIF-8 nanosheets derived N, P-codoped CNS was demonstrated to be qualified for the sensitive detection of various target analytes, including biological molecules (8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine and guanine), food additive (sunset yellow) and organic pesticide (benomyl). The linear response ranges were 2.5–1000 nM for 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, 50–3500 nM for guanine, 5.0–2000 nM for sunset yellow and 25–2000 nM for benomyl. Besides, their detection limits were as low as 0.85 nM, 14.50 nM, 2.15 nM and 7.50 nM with sensitivity of 950.00 µA μM−1 cm−2, 52.43 µA μM−1 cm−2, 527.14 µA μM−1 cm−2 and 381.43 µA μM−1 cm−2 for 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, guanine, sunset yellow and benomyl, respectively. Considering the huge application potential of two-dimensional carbon nanosheets, it is believed that the newly synthesized N, P-codoped CNS can play a much greater role for other applications.",Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical
Mechanism of interlayer spacing on catalytic properties of MoS2 from ab-initio calculation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The effect of interlayer spacing on the catalytic properties of MoS2 is systematically investigated by the ab-initio calculation. The results show that the expansion of interlayer spacing is beneficial to the catalytic hydrogen evolution when the hydrogen coverage on MoS2 is 25% and 50%. In particular, at 25% hydrogen coverage, the controllable tuning of the catalytic properties of MoS2 can be achieved by orderly tuning the interlayer spacing. When hydrogen coverage is up to 75% and 100%, the negative effect of interlayer spacing on the catalytic hydrogen evolution of MoS2 is negligible. Importantly, the 20% interlayer expansion is a critical state. If the interlayer expansion exceeds 20%, the catalytic properties of MoS2 will be greatly improved, which provides an idea to control the catalytic properties of MoS2 through tuning the interlayer spacing. Finally, the enhanced effect of interlayer expansion on the catalytic properties of MoS2 stems from the fact that the expansion of the interlayer spacing causes the occupancy density of the partially occupied antibonding orbitals near the Fermi level of Mo atoms to increase and move toward the high-energy region, which enhances the electron transfer of Mo.",Applied Surface Science
Enhanced room temperature NO2 sensing performance based on N-doped carbon nanosheets@ZnO nanoplates by morphology transition and white light illumination,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Highly-sensitive gas sensors operating at room temperature (RT) have been pursued by researchers due to their high security, energy saving and long-term stability. Herein, N-doped carbon nanosheets-incorporated zinc oxide (NCZ) was synthesized via solution calcination combined with hydrothermal method and utilized for ppb level detection of NO2 at RT. Intriguingly, the construction of N-doped carbon nanosheets was accompanied by generation of ZnO nanoparticles, and then be transferred into mesoporous nanoplates. The as-synthesized NCZ(120)-300 nanocomposites demonstrated high sensitivity to 3 ppm NO2 (|Rg-R0|/R0=∼28.2), along with fast response/recovery (60 s/129 s) speed, excellent selectivity and cyclic stability. In particular, the morphology transition of ZnO greatly enhanced the RT NO2 sensing performance of the as-prepared sensor. Meanwhile, the white light illumination further ameliorated the sensor's properties involving ∼ 2.1 times enhancement of sensitivity and shorter recovery process (accelerated from 563 s to 129 s). These enhancements are ascribed to the heterostructure between ZnO nanoplates and N-doped carbon nanosheets, and the modulation of electron structure by photo-generated electron-hole pairs. In addition, the 2D N-doped carbon nanosheets and mesoporous ZnO nanoplates offer numerous active adsorption-sites, which improved the surface chemical activity of NCZ(120)-300.",Applied Surface Science

Singly dispersed Ir1Ti3 bimetallic site for partial oxidation of methane at high temperature,"© 2022The interaction between metal and support is an essential topic in heterogeneous catalysis. The role of strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between support and metal particles, oxide, or single atom site in catalysis has been investigated recently. In this work, we report a singly dispersed bimetallic site (SDBM), Ir1Ti3, formed on TiO2 support during partial oxidation of methane. The Ir1Ti3 site exhibits an unusual “switch on/off” catalytic activity for partial oxidation of methane to produce syngas, which is due to the strong interaction between TiO2 support and in-situ formed Ir1Ti3 SDBM site. The high activity and stability of the catalyst are also due to the unique structure according to the strong interaction effect. This work reveals the SMSI between oxide and SDBM and further impacts on catalysis.",Applied Surface Science
A high-efficiency WS2 nanosheets on N-doped graphene electrocatalyst with dual-function of preventing shuttling and accelerating polysulfides conversion in Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) regarded as the most potential energy storage system, are severely restricted by sluggish conversion kinetics and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) for the practical application. In terms of these limitations, herein an in-situ grown WS2 nanosheets embedded on N-doped graphene (WS2@NG) composite configuration is presented with remarkably catalytic effect for S hosts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrochemical testing results synergistically indicate that the WS2@NG characterized by strongly interaction with LiPS species contributes to an effective inhabitation towards shuttle effect. In addition, the significant charge transfers between WS2 and LiPS interface can reduce the energy barrier for the conversion between S and Li2S. Benefitting from these merits, the LSBs based on WS2@NG/S cathodes show remarkable rate performance with a capacity of 683 mAh g−1 at 5 C and impressive cyclic durability with a retained displayed capacity of 556 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 C. Even with a sulfur loading of 6.6 mg cm−2, the WS2@NG/S based LSBs can still deliver a high areal capacity of 8.9 mAh cm−2. These results demonstrate that the WS2@NG can act as multifunctional LiPS mediators to construct high-performance LSBs system.",Applied Surface Science

Thus, encapsulant materials with very high thermal conductivity are critical for the development of packaging technologies with efficient thermal management solutions. Silver-epoxy nanocomposites have been widely applied in many electronic packaging industries because silver has the highest thermal conductivity (427 W/mK) among all metals as a bulk material which also exhibits resistant to oxidation. In addition, nanomaterials consisting of silver have weak phonon scattering and can be sintered at low temperature compared to other nanofillers, which will reduce the contact resistance and thereby improve the thermal conductivity. In this mini review, a comprehensive understanding of the thermal conductivity of epoxy resins based on different kinds of silver nanomaterials, such as silver nanoparticles, silver nanowires, silver nanoflakes, etc., is provided and discussed. Furthermore, the dependence of thermal conductivity of silver-epoxy nanocomposites on the particle size of silver, its atomic structure, surface modification, dispersion, interfacial resistance, etc. are summarized and discussed. Finally, an outlook on thermally conductive silver-epoxy nanocomposites for electronic encapsulation is discussed.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Robust interfacial engineering construction to alleviate polysulfide shuttling in metal sulfide electrodes for achieving Fast-charge High-capacity lithium storages,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Robust cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer exhibits much importance in capacity retention. However, metal sulfide electrodes with unstable CEI layers suffer from fast capacity fading and poor Coulombic efficiency caused by notorious polysulfide shuttling effect. Herein, different from nanoparticle engineering, the morphology and state of CEI interface engineering are modulated via introducing highly active lithium bisfluorosulfonylimide (LiFSI) in the ether-based electrolyte. The presence and evolution of the uniform and robust LiF-Li3N-rich CEI layer in preventing polysulfide shuttling are fully understood by electrochemical measurements, interface-sensitive sum frequency generation spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopies and electron microscopy. With the aid of the time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry, the three-dimensional architecture of CEI is re-depicted, showing the uniform coverage and thus inhibiting the polysulfide shuttling. As a result, the so-fabricated metal sulfide electrodes with continuous CEI layer exhibit much higher rate capacity and significantly-improved Coulombic efficiency than the controlled electrode samples. Even cycled at a high-power density of 6700 W kg−1 (5 C), the FeS2 electrode remains a high initial capacity (512 mA h g−1) and long lifespan up to 1000 cycles, depicting a blue-script of constructing robust CEI on the electrode for achieving the fast-charge electrodes.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Electrifying Schiff-based networks as model catalysts towards deeply understanding the crucial role of sp2-carbon in nitrogen-doped carbocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Deeply understanding the correlation between chemical microenvironment and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance is highly desired for developing efficient heteroatom-doped carbocatalysts, yet the detailed structure of chemical microenvironment remains ambiguous. Herein, a series of nitrogen-enriched carbon composites (NEC) with controllable nitrogen configuration and regularly varied sp2 carbon content are successfully developed through a rationally designed Schiff-base chemistry approach, which provides an ideal model system to testify the detailed correlation between ORR performance and sp2 carbon chemistry. By adopting vertical ionization energies (VIE) as assessments for ORR performance, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the nitrogen-doped carbocatalyst with high sp2 carbon content possesses remarkable electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, an important structural parameter, electron-conductive quaternary-N site (ENS) integrating the contents of quaternary nitrogen with sp2 carbon, is proposed, which exhibits well-fitted result with the value of VIE, and agrees well with the experimental results of ORR performance. Benefiting from those advantageous nanostructures, the resultant NECs exhibits excellent catalytic activity for ORR with a high half-wave potential of 0.80 V and promising potential as cathode materials for zinc-air batteries. Therefore, the present study may open up a new avenue for the design and prediction of ORR performance on molecular level.",Applied Surface Science
N-functionalized Ti2B MBene as high-performance anode materials for sodium-ion batteries: A DFT study,"© 2022Exploring the electrode materials for rechargeable metal-ion batteries other than lithium is a key link to the design and development of the next-generation energy storage device. Herein, the structural stabilities of B, C, and N functionalized Ti2B were systematically discussed and the potential of the stable structure Ti2BN2 as anode materials for Li-, Na-, K-, Mg-, Ca- and Zn-ion batteries was further studied using first-principles calculations. Specifically, phonon dispersion curves and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations identified the dynamic and thermal stability of Ti2BN2. The intrinsic metallic nature and non-magnetism of Ti2BN2 were then revealed by the band structure and density of state. Moreover, benefiting from the light weight and energetically favorable bilayer Na adsorption, Ti2BN2 exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 797 mA h g−1 for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), which shows great advantage than most two-dimensional anode materials. Besides, the low diffusion barrier of 0.34 eV and suitable open circuit voltage of 0.27 V further illustrate Ti2BN2 is a competitive candidate for anode material of SIBs.

Covalently grafting conjugated porous polymers to MXene offers a two-dimensional sandwich-structured electrocatalytic sulfur host for lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have received increasing attention due to their high energy density (2600 W h kg−1) as well as the low cost and nontoxicity of sulfur. However, sluggish conversion kinetics and the notorious shuttle effect of the polysulfides present in sulfur cathodes hinder the practical use of Li–S batteries. Herein, an electrocatalytic sulfur host with a two-dimensional (2D) sandwich structure is synthesized and found to display excellent properties for overcoming the noted challenges. The electrocatalytic sulfur host is prepared by covalently grafting a conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) to MXene nanosheets and denoted as CMP-M. The CMP component features triazine and benzothiophene units and thus the constituent heteroatoms endow CMP-M with a plethora of chemisorption sites to capture various polysulfides. The MXene component provides an electrocatalytic template to construct the 2D sandwich composite and can facilitate charge transfer while accelerating polysulfide conversion. Li–S cells prepared using CMP-M as sulfur hosts are found to exhibit a number of outstanding performance metrics including a high specific capacity (i.e., 1402 mA h g−1 at 0.1C), an outstanding rate capability (i.e., 610 mA h g−1 at 4C), and a low capacity decay (from an initial value of 730 to 550 after 1000 cycles at 2C, corresponding to 0.025% per cycle). The methodology presented herein offers a universal approach for constructing electrocatalytic 2D composites that are useful not only in Li–S batteries but also in other contemporary energy technologies.",Chemical Engineering Journal
High-density catalytic heterostructures strung by buried-in carbon tube network as monolithic holey host for endurable Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of Li-S batteries (LSBs) is plagued by the unreasonable integration of adsorption-catalysis-conduction functional modules. Heterojunction domains are expected to achieve the job-sharing catalysis and adsorption effects, which are however degraded by the loose discrete distribution and insufficient exposure of catalyst. Herein, we propose a unique catalysis-conduction configuration for S cathode host, featured by in-situ cascade of carbon nanotube (CNT) network with polar NiCoP/CoP heterojunction grains strung on each CNT (NiCoP/CoP@C). The compact and high-density distribution of phosphide heterostructures maximizes the exposure of catalytic sites to synergically enhance the conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides. It also enables an effective hiding of CNT skeletons to avoid the loose and uneven deposition of S-based species without the compromise of interconnected conduction pathways and electrode robustness. NiCoP/CoP@C ternary host with monolithic holey texture endows LSBs with excellent cycling stability (with capacity decay rate of merely 0.029% per cycle over 1000 cycles) under high sulfur utilization and high rate (at 2C). Even with a high sulfur loading (7.5 mg/cm2) and a low E/S ratio (7.2 µL/mg), the reversible capacity is still as high as 562 mAh/g and 4.21 mAh/cm2 after 300 cycles. The combination of low E/S ratio of 5.0 μL/mg and high S loading of 5.0 mg/cm2 still enables the durability of Li-S batteries for at least 360 cycles at 1C and highly reversible capacity close to 600 mAh/g at 0.5C.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Herein, an advanced carved particle-in-box nanoreactor, composed of small Fe-Co-Ni tri-metallic alloy nanoparticles confined in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanocage, was developed through a spatially-confined pyrolysis strategy. Tri-metal alloy could optimize the electronic structure of the catalyst, thus inducing the charge redistribution, and then regulating the adsorption and desorption energy barriers of intermediates in electrochemical reactions. Unique nano-hole design provided convenient and efficient channels for mass transfer during ORR and OER processes. Thanks to these attributes, the hybrid electrocatalyst delivered decent reversible oxygen catalytic activities, evidenced by a high half-wave potential of 0.850 V towards ORR and a low overpotential of 355 mV at 10 mA/cm2 for OER both in alkaline electrolyte.

Hierarchical hybrid architectures assembled from carbon coated Li3VO4 and in-situ generated N-doped graphene framework towards superior lithium storage,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Owing to high specific capacity (394 mA h g−1 based on a two-electron reaction), good ionic conductivity and suitable working potential (~ 0.8 V), Li3VO4 (LVO) has been recently considered as a promising intercalation anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Such material, however, suffers from poor electronic conductivity, thus limiting its practical applications. Herein, we develop a facile self-template strategy for constructing 3D hierarchical LVO/C hybrids assembled from carbon-coated LVO and in-situ generated N-doped graphene framework. Such hybrids not only offer an interconnected 3D conductive network, but also afford intimate contact between active components and conductive scaffolds, thus realizing a high-efficiency electron/ion transport system. When employed as anode for LIBs, the resulting product exhibits reversible capacities of 347.6 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 206.8 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1, and a capacity retention of 75.3 % after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1. This work provides a facile and green strategy for building 3D multiscale hierarchical hybrids, which could be extended to prepare other nanocomposites for energy-related applications.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
One-pot synthesis of sodium-doped willow-shaped graphitic carbon nitride for improved photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is considered as a promising low-cost polymeric semiconductor as conjugated photocatalyst for energy and environmental application. This study exhibits a Na-doped g-C3N4 with willow-leaf-shaped structure and high degree of crystallinity, which was synthesized with a convenient thermal polymerization using sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) as the sodium source. The π-conjugated systems of g-C3N4 were improved by doping sodium, which could accelerate the electron transport efficiency resulting in outstanding photocatalytic properties. Furthermore, optimum Na-doped g-C3N4 (CN-0.05) attributed its enhanced irradiation efficiency of light energy to its narrower band gap and significant improvement in charge separation. Consequently, the H2 evolution rate catalyzed with CN-0.05 can achieve 3559.8 μmol g−1 h−1, which is about 1.9 times higher than that with pristine g-C3N4. The rate of CN-0.05 for reduction of CO2 to CO (3.66 μmol g−1 h−1) is 6.6 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. In experiments of pollutants degradation, the reaction constants of degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) with CN-0.05 were 0.0271 and 0.0101 min−1, respectively, which are 4.7 and 7.2 times more efficient than pristine g-C3N4, respectively.

Three-dimensional porous boron nitride with enriched defects and free radicals enables high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Due to large band gap and low charge delocalization, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is usually used as catalytic support rather than catalyst, particularly photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution.

In this work, we firstly report a class of COF based S-scheme heterojunction hybrids with oxygen vacancy (OVs) for efficient visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution. The black TiO2 (TiO2-x) was chosen to integrate with TpPa-1-COF to facilitate the efficient separation of photogenerated charges and enhance photocatalytic activity. The existence of oxygen defect was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Free radical trapping experiments confirmed the successful integration of COF based S-scheme heterojunction hybrids with oxygen defect. The results of H2 evolution experiments verify that H2 evolution rate of TiO2-x/TpPa-1-COF (6:4) reaches an optimum of 15.33 mmol·h−1·g−1 (with the TOF of 235.74 h−1), which is about 8 and 10.5 times that of pure TpPa-1-COF and TiO2-x, respectively. Moreover, it was demonstrated that TiO2-x/TpPa-1-COF also exhibited apparent higher H2 evolution activity (3.5 times) than that of TiO2/TpPa-1-COF (6:4) without oxygen defect in TiO2. Further investigations about photoelectric properties verify that S-scheme heterojunction with oxygen defect can better promote separation of photogenerated charges from COF in comparison with defect-less TiO2.",Chemical Engineering Journal

After optimizing the pyrolysis temperatures, the optimal Co@BNPCFs-800 owns a large surface area and abundant carbon edges/defects. Especially, 6.86 atom % of B and 6.59 atom % of N atoms are doped into carbon frameworks with affording 13.45 atom % of B/N active centers (i.e. BC3, pyridinic-N, Co-Nx-C, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N). In alkaline solution, the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 of the optimal Co@BNPCFs-800 (151.3 mV) is just 82.4 mV larger than 20 wt% Pt/C (68.9 mV). Especially, the oxygen evolution reaction potential at 10 mA cm−2 of the optimal Co@BNPCFs-800 (1.554 V vs. RHE) is even 2 mV more negative than RuO2 (1.556 V vs. RHE).

Subnanometer MoP clusters confined in mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) as superior electrocatalytic sulfur hosts for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are promising high-energy–density storage devices but severe shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LPSs), low sulfur utilization and sluggish reaction kinetics impede the practical applications. Herein, we report MoP clusters embedded in CMK-3 (cMoP-CMK-3) as a lightweight, conductive, and catalytic cathodic host with large sulfur mass loading for high energy Li-S batteries. The electronically conductive CMK-3 with ordered mesoporous channels could accommodate high loading and expansion of the active sulfur material and facilitate fast ionic/electronic transportation. The strong interaction between cMoP and CMK-3 results in concentrated Li ions inside the channels due to enhanced local electric field, significantly eliminating dead sulfur and improving sulfur utilization to over 90% due to confined catalytic effect. Moreover, the cMoP embedded into channels provide rich adsorptive and catalytic sites to effectively trap LPSs, and catalytically accelerate reaction kinetics. The resulting S@cMoP-CMK-3 cathode shows a large capacity of 1100 mAh g−1 at 0.5C (1C = 1675 mA g−1) based on the total mass of cathode, high-rate capacity of 767.8 mAh g−1 at 5C, and excellent cycle stability with 0.02% capacity fade per cycle over 500 cycles at 2C.

The alkali-electrolyzer using Ni2P/WS2/Co9S8@C as cathode and anode electrodes delivers a low cell voltage of 1.48 V achieving 10 mA cm−2 with good durability.

Upon the introduction of potassium ferricyanide (PF) and/or phosphomolybdic acid (POM), cubic zeolitic-imidazole framework-67 (Cube-67) undergoes both chemical and macroscopic morphology changes, i.e., from nanocubes to hollow nanopompoms, where PF and POM act as the weak chelator (i.e., for finer structures) and the strong chelator (i.e., shape-directing agent), respectively. After calcination, the hierarchically structured nanopompoms display tunable and high-performance OER and ORR catalytic activities suitable for Zn–air batteries that display a long-term charge–discharge cycling stability. This work not only holds promise for clean-energy applications but provides a design principle for engineering advanced electrocatalysts by effectively tuning their structural and chemical properties.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Constructing a catalytic reservoir using cobalt nanoparticles-MoS2@nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes on the separator to immobilize polysulfides and accelerate their conversion for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising electrochemical energy storage systems because of their high theoretical specific capacity and energy density. However, the shuttle effect of polysulfides and the slow redox kinetics significantly hinder their practical application. This study demonstrates a separator modification strategy that is expected to address these issues. The material for the modification is a functional carbon nanotube containing nitrogen heteroatoms and encapsulating cobalt nanoparticles. The external surface of the carbon nanotube was covered with a layer of molybdenum disulfide nanosheets (Co-MoS2@NC). The electrochemical measurements showed that the Co-MoS2@NC modified separator can inhibit the shuttle effect and promote the kinetics of the redox reaction. Both experimental investigation and the theoretical study confirmed the capability of MoS2 for the chemical adsorption and the catalytic conversion of the polysulfides. The electrochemical insight studies showed that the Li-S battery assembled with the Co-MoS2@NC modified separator has an excellent Li+ diffusion rate, enhanced rate performance (610.1 mAh g−1 at 4 C), and stable cycle life (only 0.053% capacity decay per cycle at 1 C after 1000 cycles). It is expected that this modification strategy will find its promising application for high-performance and long-life Li-S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Carbonaceous-Material-Induced Gelation of Concentrated Electrolyte Solutions for Application in Lithium-Sulfur Battery Cathodes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries can theoretically deliver high energy densities exceeding 2500 Wh kg-1. However, high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions are two major requirements to enhance the actual energy density of the Li-S batteries. Herein, the use of carbon-dispersed highly concentrated electrolyte (HCE) gels with sparingly solvating characteristics as sulfur hosts in Li-S batteries is proposed as a unique approach to construct continuous electron-transport and ion-conduction paths in sulfur cathodes as well as achieve high energy density under lean-electrolyte conditions. The sol-gel behavior of carbon-dispersed sulfolane-based HCEs was investigated using phase diagrams. The sol-to-gel transition was mainly dependent on the amount of the carbonaceous material and the Li salt content. The gelation was caused by the carbonaceous-material-induced formation of an integrated network. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the strong cation-πinteractions between Li+and the induced dipole of graphitic carbon were responsible for facilitating the dispersion of the carbonaceous material into the HCEs, thereby permitting gel formation at high Li-salt concentrations. The as-prepared carbon-dispersed sulfolane-based composite gels were employed as efficient sulfur hosts in Li-S batteries. The use of gel-type sulfur hosts eliminates the requirement for excess electrolytes and thus facilitates the practical realization of Li-S batteries under lean-electrolyte conditions. A Li-S pouch cell that achieved a high cell-energy density (up to 253 Wh kg-1) at a high sulfur loading (4.1 mg cm-2) and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (4.2 μL mg-1) was developed. Furthermore, a Li-S polymer battery was fabricated by combining the composite gel cathode and a polymer gel electrolyte.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Atomic Imaging and Thermally Induced Dynamic Structural Evolution of Two-Dimensional Cr2S3,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.In this study, facile salt-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was used to synthesize ultrathin non-van der Waals chromium sulfide (Cr2S3) with a thickness of ∼1.9 nm. The structural transformation of as-grown Cr2S3was studied using advanced in situ heating techniques combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Two-dimensional (2D) and quasi-one-dimensional (1D) samples were fabricated to investigate the connection between specific planes and the dynamic behavior of the structural variation. The rearrangement of atoms during the phase transition was driven by the loss of sulfur atoms at elevated temperatures, resulting in increased free energy. A decrease in the ratio of the (001) plane led to an overall increase in surface energy, thus lowering the critical phase transition temperature. Our study provides detailed insight into the mechanism of structural transformation and the critical factors governing transition temperature, thus paving the way for future studies on intriguing Cr-S compounds.",Nano Letters
Descriptor-Driven Computational Design of Bifunctional Double-Atom Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation Reaction Electrocatalysts for Rechargeable Hydrogen Gas Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Rechargeable hydrogen gas batteries (RHGBs) have been attracting much attention as promising all-climate large-scale energy storage devices, which calls for low-cost and high-activity hydrogen evolution/oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) bifunctional electrocatalysts to replace the costly platinum-based catalysts. Based on density functional theory (DFT) computations, herein we report an effective descriptor-driven design principle to govern the HER/HOR electrocatalytic activity of double-atom catalysts (DACs) for RHGBs. We systematically investigate the d-band center variation of DACs and their correlations with HER/HOR free energies. We construct activity maps with the d-band center of DACs as a descriptor, which demonstrate that high HER/HOR electrocatalytic activity can be achieved with an appropriate d-band center of DACs. This work not only broadens the applicability of d-band center theory to the prediction of bifunctional HER/HOR electrocatalysts but also paves the way to fast screening and design of efficient and low-cost DACs to promote practical applications of RHGBs.",Nano Letters
Lithium Atom Surface Diffusion and Delocalized Deposition Propelled by Atomic Metal Catalyst toward Ultrahigh-Capacity Dendrite-Free Lithium Anode,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium metal anode possesses overwhelming capacity and low potential but suffers from dendrite growth and pulverization, causing short lifespan and low utilization. Here, a fundamental novel insight of using single-atomic catalyst (SAC) activators to boost lithium atom diffusion is proposed to realize delocalized deposition. By combining electronic microscopies, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, theoretical simulations, and electrochemical analyses, we have unambiguously depicted that the SACs serve as kinetic activators in propelling the surface spreading and lateral redistribution of the lithium atoms for achieving dendrite-free plating morphology. Under the impressive capacity of 20 mA h cm-2, the Li modified with SAC-activator exhibits a low overpotential of ∼50 mV at 5 mA cm-2, a long lifespan of 900 h, and high Coulombic efficiencies during 150 cycles, much better than most literature reports. The so-coupled lithium-sulfur full battery delivers high cycling and rate performances, showing great promise toward the next-generation lithium metal batteries.",Nano Letters
Atomically Dispersed Fe-N5 Sites Anchored in Porous N-Doped Carbon Nanofibers for Effective Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Atomically dispersed electrocatalysts are a major focus of chemical and energy conversion, while the structure and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance affected by single atoms loading need to be further explored. Herein, we developed an N-coordination strategy to design Fe-N5sites distributed on N-doped porous nanofibers (Fe SA/PNCNFs-0.1) as an efficient HER catalyst by the wet impregnation method. The results show that Fe species exist in the form of dispersed single atoms. The binding between the Fe atom and N atom is strong, forming the coordination structure of Fe-N5. In the acidic HER, Fe SA/PNCNFs-0.1 improves the catalytic performance toward the HER with a small overpotential of 44.3 mV at 10 mA cm-2current density and a low Tafel slope of 45.4 mV dec-1, which are superior to those of Fe single atoms with less Fe contents (Fe SA/PNCNFs-0.4) and Fe nanoparticles (Fe NP/PNCNFs). Fe SA/PNCNFs-0.1 also has excellent HER activity and durability in alkaline media, highlighting the potential application of Fe single atoms for hydrogen production.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
Tailoring the Boron Configurations in B-doped Na3V2(PO4)3@Carbon for Fast and Durable Sodium Storage,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is a widely studied cathode material for sodium-ion batteries because of its high ionic conductivity and attractive charge/discharge plateau (3.4 V vs. Na/Na+). However, its poor electronic conductivity and severe volume expansion during sodium storage need to be addressed before its intensive application could be realized. Herein, boron-doped NVP was synthesized through a facile electrospinning method. By adding boric acid into the reaction mixture during electrospinning followed by carbonization, boron could be directly inserted into the carbon matrix, giving rise to B-doped carbon nanofiber wrapped NVP. By tuning the doping amount, the boron-containing configurations could be facilely manipulated, playing different roles in promoting the sodium storage properties of the composite. Based on the calculation results, BC2O enhanced sodium diffusion by lowering the energy barrier, while BCO2 improved the structural stability. Due to these specific functionalities of the configurations, the as-prepared composite with a balanced amount of BC2O and BCO2 demonstrated superior sodium storage capacity of 113 mAh g−1 at 1 C, outstanding long cycling performance of 103 mAh g−1 at 10 C, and retained 91 mAh g−1 after 1500 cycles. This gave rise to a capacity loss of only 0.08‰ per cycle, much better than the undoped counterpart.",ChemSusChem
Tunable electronic properties of silicon nanowires as sodium-battery anodes,"© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Although materials for lithium-ion batteries have been extensively studied, alternatives such as sodium-ion batteries have acquired a renewed interest due to the abundance of Na compared to Li. However, the investigation of new materials for Na battery anodes is still in progress. In this work, a density functional study of the electronic properties of hydrogen passivated silicon nanowires (H-SiNWs) with interstitial Na atoms is presented. The studied H-SiNWs are grown along the [001] crystallographic direction and have a diameter close to 2.5 nm. Moreover, from 1 to 12 interstitial Na atoms per H-SiNW unit cell were considered. The results reveal that the former semiconducting nanowires become metallic for all the Na concentrations, even for the case of a single Na atom. The formation energy diminishes as a function of the concentration of Na atoms, revealing a loss of energetic stability since the size of the Na atoms strongly modify the Si-Si bonds. Moreover, when the Na atoms are removed from the metallic sodiated H-SiNW and relaxed again, for concentrations between 1 and 8 Na atoms, the resulting structure corresponds to the original H-SiNW one, indicating that the Na insertion/extraction process is a reversible one. In contrast, for concentrations between 10 and 12 Na atoms, the structure that results from removing of these Na atoms has a different atomic arrangement, in comparison with the initial H-SiNW, and also smaller band gap. These results open the possibility to consider the H-SiNWs as potential anodic materials in sodium rechargeable batteries.",International Journal of Energy Research

Surface Film Formation from Sodium Polysulfide Decomposition on Sodium-Metal Anode Surface,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries are being considered as an alternative next generation of energy storage devices to replace lithium-sulfur batteries due to lower costs of Na metal while keeping a high theoretical capacity. A comprehensive understanding of polysulfide decomposition mechanisms and passivation film formation on the Na-metal surface has challenged the development of this metal-sulfur chemistry. Here, using first-principles modeling, we study the adsorption of sodium polysulfide (NaPS) molecules on the Na-metal surface and investigate the Na2S film formation from soluble NaPS decomposition in the presence of different electrolyte solvents (i.e., EC, PC, and EC/PC mixture). We find that NaPS molecules strongly interact with the Na-metal surface via Na-S bonds, leading to charge migration from the metal to the adsorbates. Such strong adsorption precedes a complete spontaneous electron-transfer decomposition of NaPS to form an amorphous Na2S film on the anode surface. The reduction reaction mechanisms are identified for each electrolyte, suggesting that polysulfides are completely decomposed in a short time. The energetic properties suggest that the first and second steps in the reaction of NaPS decomposition in the mixture solvent are thermodynamically uphill. The decomposed S atoms from NaPS can insert into the Na slab, leading to Na2S formation. The decomposition of multiple NaPS molecules reveals that the reduction of further NaPS on the surface after the first one is sluggish and incomplete because of the passivating nature of the nascent Na2S film, while NaPS far from the surface remains in the electrolyte phase forming a soluble NaPS cluster dissolved in the solvent.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
First Principles Study of Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2to CH4on WS2-Supported Pt Clusters,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.CO2conversion into valuable chemicals and fuels is a sustainable route to the concurrent mitigation of the energy crisis and the greenhouse effect. Herein, first principles calculations were employed to study the photocatalytic CO2reduction over pristine WS2, S-vacancy WS2, and Pt cluster loaded WS2. Our results indicate that the introducing of S-vacancy and loading of Pt clusters can improve the optical absorption in the visible-light region. Furthermore, S-vacancy can lower the barrier (by about 0.17 eV) for *COOH intermediate formation. For Pt/WS2, the strong metal-support interaction is confirmed by high adsorption energy and charge transfer. Importantly, the electron-rich Pt cluster promotes *CO intermediates to facilitate the formation of *CHO intermediates and to further protonate to CH4. This study provides some useful insights into designing the catalysts for the reduction of CO2and further widens the applications of WS2-based catalytic materials.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Rational Design of Sulfur-Doped Carbon with Expanded Inter-layer Spacing toward Anode Material of Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.For renewable energy storage, it is critical to develop effective carbon-based anode materials for sodium-ion storage, and heteroatom doping is a viable method for fine-tuning the electrochemical performance of carbon materials. Heteroatom-doped carbon materials, especially sulfur-doped carbon (CS) materials, have been the favored anode material to provide enhanced specific capacity for sodium-ion batteries. This report provides a method for the successful preparation of CSs from thiophene as a single-source precursor accompanied by annealing at a high temperature. The existence of sulfur provides expanded interlayers of carbon, and via changing the pyrolysis temperature (1000-1200 °C), the sulfur content is varied. Under a current density of 25 mA g-1, the produced electrode material acts as an anode and exhibits a specific capacity of almost 243 mA h g-1. The fabricated electrode also exhibits outstanding cyclic stability, sustaining 77% at 100 mA g-1 current over 500 cycles. The synergistic effect of sulfur and expanded interlayers of carbon brought on by the doping of sulfur atoms can be the reason for the optimized carbon's improved performance.",Energy and Fuels

Advances and challenges in anode graphite recycling from spent lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been one of the fast-growing and largest quantities of solid waste in the world. Spent graphite anode, accounting for 12–21 wt% of batteries, contains metals, binders, toxic, and flammable electrolytes. The efficient recovery of spent graphite is urgently needed for environmental protection and resource sustainability. Recently, more and more studies have been focused on spent graphite recycling, while the advance and challenges are rarely summarized. Hence, this study made a comprehensive review of graphite recycling including separation, regeneration, and synthesis of functional materials.

Meanwhile, we briefly compared the economic and environmental benefits of graphite regeneration and other functional materials production. Finally, the technical bottlenecks and challenges for spent graphite recycling were summarized and some future research directions were proposed.

Ultrathin porous carbon nitride nanosheets with well-tuned band structures via carbon vacancies and oxygen doping for significantly boosting H2 production,"© 2022Significant improving g-C3N4’s photocatalytic efficiency still remains a great challenge. In this work, we synthesized ultrathin and porous 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets with a controllable concentration of carbon vacancies and oxygen doping. Water vapor opens the heptazine units, introduces carbon vacancies, and acts as an oxygen source for oxygen doping under high temperatures. The synergistic effect of controllable carbon vacancies and oxygen doping can continuously regulate band structures and significantly improves the separation efficiency of photoexcited charges. As a result, the prepared g-C3N4 with vigoroso reduction potential exhibits a very high photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 2.414 mmol g−1 h−1 under visible light and 7.414 mmol g−1 h−1 under ultraviolet-visible light, respectively, which outperforms the majority of the previously reported g-C3N4 with well-tuned band structure.

InSn plasma penetration through protective single-walled carbon nanotube-based membranes,"© 2022 Author(s).Laser-produced plasma sources of short-wavelength (1-20-nm) radiation are actively used nowadays in numerous applications, including water-window microscopy and extreme ultra-violet lithography. Suppression of laser-plasma debris (responsible for damaging optics) is crucial for the lifetime prolongation of optical systems operated with the short-wavelength radiation. Here, we examine the capability of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-based membranes to decrease an InSn plasma flux containing both ions and atoms. Faraday cup measurements show that 40- and 90-nm-thick SWCNT membranes reduce the total charge transition by 20 and 130 times, respectively. The ion analyzer measurements demonstrate that ions pass through the membrane mainly due to the collisionless (ballistic) mechanism. Using scanning electron microscopy, we estimate a decrease in a plasma (ions + atoms) flux to be of 18 and 140 times for 40- and 90-nm-thick SWCNT-based membranes, respectively. The average plasma flux attenuation coefficient of SWCNT membranes is calculated as k = 0.063 nm - 1.",Applied Physics Letters
Carbon Coated Metal-Based Composite Electrode Materials for Lithium Sulfur Batteries: A Review,"© 2022 The Chemical Society of Japan & Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium-sulfur battery is one of the most promising secondary battery systems due to their high energy density and low material cost.

Strategic Electrochemical Determination of Nitrate over Polyaniline/Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes-Gum Arabic Architecture,"© 2022 by the authors.Significant agricultural and industrial activities necessitate the regular monitoring of nitrate (NO3−) ions levels in feed and groundwater. The current comparative study discloses an innovative user-friendly electrochemical approach for the determination of NO3− over polyaniline (PAni)-based modified electrodes. The electrochemical sensors concocted with PAni, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT), and gum arabic (GA). The unique electrode material GA@PAni-CNT was synthesized by facile one-pot catalytic polymerization of aniline (Ani) with FeCl3/H2O2 in the presence of CNT and GA as integral components. As revealed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), the anchoring/retention of NO3− followed by reduction is proposed to occur when a GA@PAni-CNT electrode is immersed in phosphate buffer electrolyte containing NO3− that eventually results in a significantly higher redox activity of the GA@PAni-CNT electrode upon potential scan. The mechanism of NO3− anchoring may be associated with the non-redox transition of leucomeraldine salt (LS) into emeraldine salt (ES) and the generation of nitrite (NO2−) ions. As a result, the oxidation current produced by CV for redox transition of ES ↔ pernigraniline (PN) was ~9 times of that obtained with GA@PAni-CNT electrode and phosphate buffer electrolyte, thus achieving indirect NO3− voltammetric determination of the GA@PAni-CNT electrode. The prepared GA@PAni-CNT electrode displayed a higher charge transfer ability as compared to that of PAni-CNT and PAni electrodes. The optimum square wave voltammetric (SWV) response resulted in two linear concentration ranges of 1–10 (R2 = 0.9995) and 15–50 µM (R2 = 0.9988) with a detection limit of 0.42 µM, which is significantly lower. The GA@PAni-CNT electrode demonstrated the best detection, sensitivity, and performance among the investigated electrodes for indirect voltammetric determination of NO3− that portrayed the possibility of utilizing GA—stabilized PAni and CNT nanocomposite materials in additional electrochemical sensing applications.",Nanomaterials
Degradation of Tetracycline in Water by Fe-Modified Sterculia Foetida Biochar Activated Peroxodisulfate,"© 2022 by the authors.Tetracycline (TC) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic commonly, made use of in aquaculture and animal husbandry. After entering water bodies, it will represent a major threat to human health. In this study, sterculia foetida biochar (SFC) was readied by the combined hydrothermal pyrolysis (co-HTP) method with sterculia foetida as raw materials. Fen-SFC (Fe2-SFC, Fe3-SFC, and Fe4-SFC) was obtained by doping SFH with different concentrations of FeCl3. Finally, activation of peroxodisulfate (PDS) was achieved, using Fe3-SFC to degrade TC. The degradation of TC obeyed pseudo-second-order kinetics, and the constant of the reaction rate was 0.491 L mg−1 min−1. Radical trapping experiments, EPR test and electrochemical tests evidenced that the high catalytic performance of the Fe3-SFC/PDS system was ascribed to free radical pathway (•OH and SO4•−) and non-radical pathway (1O2 and electron transfer), in which the latter plays a dominant role. This research not only demonstrates a new kind of biochar as an effective catalyst for PS activation, but also offers an avenue for the value-added reuse of sterculia foetida.",Sustainability (Switzerland)
Field Emission Nanoemitters Based on T-Contact Connections from Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene Zigzag Nanoribbons Covalently Bound to Them,"© 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.Abstract: Using quantum mechanical approaches, the electronic and electrophysical properties of T-contact connections based on thin chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and graphene zigzag nanoribbons are studied from the standpoint of their application as field-emission blade-type nanoemitters with an atomic thickness of the emitting blade. The fact of a sharp decrease in the contact electrical resistance by 87% for the investigated three-pole contact (T-contact) from the side of two contacts, which are semi-infinite SWCNTs, is established. Resistance of a graphene zigzag nanoribbon connected perpendicular to the contacts from SWCNTs as part of a three-pole is comparable to the resistance of the nanoribbon itself and is ~3.3 kΩ. It is shown that the covalent bonds of graphene ribbons with nanotubes predetermine a high tensile strength in strong electric fields, which ensures the integrity of the atomic structure even in electric fields of ~1.5 × 108 V/nm. It was revealed that the mechanical force of the electric field, which is from 23 to 36 nN, causes periodic deformations of the atomic frame with a frequency of ~1.25 THz.",Journal of Communications Technology and Electronics
Synergizing high valence metal sites and amorphous/crystalline interfaces in electrochemical reconstructed CoFeOOH heterostructure enables efficient oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Cobalt hydroxide nanosheet is among the most popular oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst yet still suffers from sluggish catalytic kinetics, limited activity, and poor stability. Here, an efficient in situ electrochemical reconstructed CoFe-hydroxides derived OER electrocatalyst was reported. The introduction of Fe promoted the transformation of Co2+ into Co3+ in CoFe-hydroxides nanosheet, along with the formation of abundant amorphous/crystalline interfaces. Thanks for the retained nanosheet microstructure, high valence Co3+ and Fe3+ species, and the amorphous/crystalline heterostructure interfaces, the as-designed electrochemical reconstructed CoFeOOH nanosheet/Ni foam (CoFeOOHNS/NF) electrode delivers 100 mA·cm−2 in alkaline at an overpotential of 275 mV and can stably electrocatalyze water oxidation for at least 35 h at 100 mA·cm−2. Meanwhile, the alkaline full water splitting electrolyzer achieves a current density of 10 mA·cm−2 only at 1.522 V for CoFeOOHNS/NFIIPt/C/NF, which is much lower than that of Ru/C/NFIIPt/C/NF (1.655 V@10 mA·cm−2).

Construction of nanoporous Mo2C shell/MoO3 core composite by converting MoO3 and its superior performance in lithium sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is a promising energy storage device in the future. However, its performance is strongly affected by the shuttle effect and inherent sluggish kinetics. Herein, Mo2C/MoO3-modified separator is constructed, in which MoO3 particles are derived by the decomposition of Mo source and simultaneously their surfaces are converted (reduced and carbonized) into Mo2C, i.e., Mo2C shell/MoO3 core. In addition, the resin matrix of the waste CFRP (Carbon fiber reinforced polymer) acts as the carbon source for the change from MoO3 to Mo2C, while CF is claimed from CFRP. The synergistic effect of conductive Mo2C-shell and polar MoO3-core anchors lithium polysulfide to promote the conversion of sulfur. Benefited from block effect on the soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) and catalytic effect on sulfur, Li-S battery with Mo2C/MoO3-modified separator owns excellent electrochemical performance: A high initial discharge specific capacity of 1288 mAh g−1 at 0.2C and an initial capacity of 670 mAh g−1 at 4C, as well as the average decay rate per cycle of 0.039% over 250 times.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
Cobalt Nanoparticles Loaded on MXene for Li-S Batteries: Anchoring Polysulfides and Accelerating Redox Reactions,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Catalysis is regarded as an effective strategy to fundamentally increase sulfur utilization, accelerating the kinetics of the transformation between lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and lithium sulfide (Li2S) on a substrate. However, the intermodulation of catalysts and sulfur species is elusive, which is limited to the comprehensive analysis of electrochemical performance in the dynamic reaction process. Herein, cobalt nanoparticles loaded on MXene nanosheets (Co/Ti2C) are selected as sulfur hosts and the representative catalyst. By combining ex situ electrochemical results and interfacial structural chemical monitoring, the catalysis process of Co/Ti2C toward LiPSs conversion is revealed, and the outstanding performance originates from the optimization of chemical adsorption, catalytic activity, and lithium-ion transfer behaviors, which is based on electronic/ion modulation and sufficient interfaces among catalysts and electrolyte. This work can guide the construction of electronic modulation at triple-phase interface catalysis to overcome the shuttle effect and facilitate sulfur redox kinetics in Li-S batteries.",Small
"Cobalt (iron), nitrogen and carbon doped mushroom biochar for high-efficiency oxygen reduction in microbial fuel cell and Zn-air battery","© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.To improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics in microbial fuel cell (MFC) and Zn-air battery, cobalt (iron), nitrogen and carbon doped mushroom biochar, i.e. CoNC@MC, FeNC@MC and CoFeNC@MC were prepared using metal-organic frameworks and mushroom as the precursors. The catalysts showed a mesopore-dominant structure with abundant Metal-N, Pyridinic-N and Graphitic-N catalytic active sites. Rotating disk electrode tests revealed that FeNC@MC performed the best ORR activity in neutral and alkaline solutions, which followed the four-electron transfer ORR pathway. Acid leaching could further improve the ORR activity of FeNC@MC in neutral conditions. In MFCs, the FeNC@MC and acid-leached FeNC@MC yielded maximum power densities of 1052.5 mW m-2 and 1126.3 mW m-2 respectively. The above catalysts also produced high power densities of 94.0 mW cm-2 and 93.7 mW cm-2 in the Zn-air battery, with high stability and good methanol tolerance.

Emerging Heterogeneous Supports for Efficient Electrocatalysis,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Electrocatalysis plays a fundamental role in many fields, such as metallurgy, medicine, chemical industry, and energy conversion. Anchoring active electrocatalysts with controllable loading and uniform dispersion onto suitable supports has become an attractive topic. This is because the supports can not only have the potential to improve catalytic activity and stability through the interaction between support and catalytic center, but also can reduce precious metal consumption by improving atomic utilization.

Engineering the Framework Cobalt and Hierarchical Pores of Aluminophosphates for Enhanced Performance in n-Butene Skeletal Isomerization,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.An effective method is proposed to synthesize a hierarchical Co-doped AlPO4 molecular sieve (CoAIP-CTAB). For the obtained zeolite, both framework and extra framework Co are firstly established and identified by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). The percentage of framework Co (P–O–Co–O–P) is estimated to be 82%. Due to the hierarchical structure and abundant Co sites in the framework, CoAIP-CTAB nanocrystals have shown high catalytic activity and stability for the catalytic conversion of n-butenes to isobutene at mild temperature (350 °C) without gas dilution. This novel synthesis strategy may inspire the design of similar types of industrial zeolite catalysts for selective reactions.",Advanced Materials Interfaces
Visible Light Induced Ag–Polyoxometalate Coassembly into Single-Cluster Nanowires,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.1D superlattices with long-ranged periodicity present extraordinary application properties due to their unique electronic structures. Here, the visible light driven synthesis of 1D single-cluster chains constructed by polyoxometalate (POM) and Ag clusters is reported, where two types of clusters align alternatively along the nanowire.

Precise Control of Li+ Directed Transport via Electronegative Polymer Brushes on Polyolefin Separators for Dendrite-Free Lithium Deposition,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Nonuniform ion flux triggers uneven lithium (Li) deposition and continuous dendrite growth, severely restricting the lifetime of Li-metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, an electronegative poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate) (PPFPA) polymer brush-grafted Celgard separator signed as PPFPA-g-Celgard is designed to precisely construct one-dimensionally directed Li+ flux at the nanoscale so as to realize faster ion transport and ultra-stable Li deposition. The grafting of PPFPA polymer chains is enabled by the simple bio-inspired engineering of surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization chemistry. Both theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate an obvious increase by almost two times in Li+ affinity and ion transfer kinetics for PPFPA-g-Celgard over the Celgard separator. Reversible and stable Li plating/stripping can be realized by rapidly switching from 0.5 to 6 mA cm-2. Besides, the Li | PPFPA-g-Celgard | LiFePO4 full cell exhibits universal and long-term cyclability with a capacity retention of 83% over 700 cycles in ether electrolyte and 92.9% for over 300 cycles in carbonate electrolyte as well. This study represents a new direction for the general design of advanced separators with typical surface topochemistry and self-limited ion transport channels in the application of high-performance LMBs.",Advanced Functional Materials
"Ti3C2T x MXene anchoring semi-metallic selenium atoms: self-powered photoelectrochemical-type photodetector, hydrogen evolution, and gas-sensing applications","© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.MXenes have demonstrated substantial promise as photocatalysts and electrocatalysts for a variety of applications such as self-powered photoelectrochemical (PEC)-type photodetector, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and vapor sensing applications. However, their mechanism is still poorly figured out. Currently, Ti3C2T x MXene suffers from low photoresponsivity, high overpotential, and low sensitivity in such important applications. In order to develop catalytic activity and performances of those devices, modifications must be made to the structure of MXenes to enhance the separation of photogenerated charges, rate of the H+/e− couplings, and surface-active sites. These manipulations of MXenes heavily depend on understanding the mechanism of devices, appropriate modification elements, and the method of modification. This study for the first time reveals a facile solid-state annealing strategy for doping semi-metallic selenium (Se) atoms on Ti3C2T x MXene for self-powered PEC-type photodetector, HER, and vapor sensor applications. The suitable characteristics of Ti3C2T x make it an appropriate substrate to accommodate Se atoms. The well-designed Se-doped Ti3C2 heterojunction including some TiO2 cuboids could exhibit unprecedented photoresponsivity (up to 90 mA W−1) and detectivity (up to 2.0 × 108 cm Hz1/2 W−1) for 420 nm light, HER (−0.7 V at 10 mA cm−2), and gas sensitivity (Z′ = 347 Ω and Z′′ = 150 Ω, for ethanol) in comparison with the pristine Ti3C2T x nanosheets. The acquired promising results can be promoted with some other elements and also be examined in other electrolytes. Then, bring inspiration to the applications involving charge transfer, H+/e− couplings, and surface-active sites.",2D Materials
Adsorption mechanisms of different toxic molecular gases on intrinsic C2N and Ti-C2N-V monolayer: a DFT study,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Recently, the excessive emission of chemical toxic gases such as nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), ammonia (NH3), phosgene (COCL2), and benzene (C6H6) has caused serious environmental problems. Adsorption of these chemical toxic gas molecules is a promising method to reduce environmental pollution. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the adsorption properties of these chemical toxic molecules on intrinsic C2N and Ti-C2N-V monolayer. The results show that NF3, NH3, C6H6, and COCL2 can all be adsorbed to the intrinsic C2N monolayer with weak adsorption energy, while the adsorption properties of these gas molecules were greatly improved after doping Ti atom. The adsorption energy of NH3, C6H6, COCL2, and NF3 increased from − 0.585, − 0.432, − 0.633, and − 0.362 eV to − 2.214, − 1.699, − 1.822, and − 0.799 eV, respectively, which increased by 2 ~ 4 times compared with that before doping. Besides, the results of the electron distribution, work function, the total density of states (TDOS), and the partial density of states (PDOS) analysis indicate that the doped Ti atom can be used as a bridge to connect the adsorbed molecules with the C2N-V monolayer, strengthen their interaction, and significantly improve the adsorption capacity. Therefore, Ti-doped C2N-V (Ti-C2N-V) monolayer is a promising adsorbent for the enrichment and utilization of harmful gases.

Structural regulation of Fe–Co prussian blue analogues by incorporation of Pt for enhanced electrocatalytic overall water splitting,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCThe specific properties of easy manufacturing, open frameworks, and high specific surface area endow prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as promising electrode materials for water splitting. Herein, we reported the successful application of interface engineering strategy to introduce low content of Pt species to boost the electrocatalytic activity of FeCo PBAs by ammonia etching and subsequent calcination. The resulting PtCo alloy modified FeCo PBAs (PtCo–FeCo PBAs) complex reveals modest electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials (η) of 139 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 310 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline electrolyte. Remarkably, the PtCo–FeCo PBAs only required small cell voltage of 1.68 V to drive 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting and the ideal electrocatalytic activity can be maintained for more than 50 h at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The structural analysis unveils that the strong interaction between FeCo PBAs host and PtCo alloy resulting in charge redistribution and ultimately lead to high electrocatalytic activity and stability of PtCo–FeCo PBAs for both HER and OER.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
Atomically Dispersed Fe-N4 Sites and Fe3C Particles Catalyzing Polysulfides Conversion in Li-S Batteries,"© 2022, Jilin University, The Editorial Department of Chemical Research in Chinese Universities and Springer-Verlag GmbH.Lithium-sulfur(Li-S) batteries have been puzzled by the “shuttle effect”. In the recent years, catalytic materials present a huge potential for solving this problem. However, the exploitation for catalytic activity was still challenging in Li-S batteries. In this article, we put forward a single atom catalyst (SAC) of FeN4 coupled with Fe3C on the N-doped carbon (FeN4/Fe3C@NC) by one-step pyrolysis method. The FeN4 and Fe3C synergistically catalyze the polysulfides conversion when the N-doped carbon provides the high conductive three-dimensional skeleton in Li-S batteries. As a result, the FeN4/Fe3C@NC shows a specific capacity of 1100 mA·h/g at 0.2 C(1 C=1675 mA/g). In addition, the FeN4/Fe3C@NC maintains 99.01% of the pristine specific capacity after 100 cycles at 0.5 C, indicating the improved electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries. This work sheds new lights on the design of engineering catalysts for developing high-performance Li-S batteries. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Chemical Research in Chinese Universities
Co-recrystallization induced self-catalytic Li2S cathode fully interfaced with sulfide catalyst toward a high-performance lithium-free sulfur battery,"© 2022 The Authors. InfoMat published by UESTC and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Lithium sulfide (Li2S) is a promising cathode for a practical lithium-sulfur battery as it can be coupled with various safe lithium-free anodes. However, the high activation potential (>3.5 V) together with the shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) bottleneck its practical uses. We are trying to present a catalysis solution to solve both problems simultaneously, specially with twinborn heterostructure to shoot off the trouble in interfacial contact between two solids, catalyst and Li2S. As a typical example, a Co9S8/Li2S heterostructure is reported here as a novel self-catalytic cathode through a co-recrystallization followed by a one-step carbothermic conversion. Co9S8 as the catalyst effectively lowers the Li2S activation potential (<2.4 V) due to fully integrated and contacted interfaces and consistently promotes the conversion of LiPSs to suppress the shuttling. The obtained freestanding cathode of Co9S8/Li2S heterostructures encapsulated in three-dimensional graphene shows a high capacity, reaching 92.6% of Li2S theoretical capacity, high rate performance (739 mAh g−1 at 2 C), and a low capacity fading (0.039% per cycle at 1 C over 900 cycles). Even under a high Li2S loading of 12 mg cm−2 and a low E/S ratio of (Formula presented.), 86% of theoretical capacity can be utilized. (Figure presented.).",InfoMat
In-situ doping nickel single atoms in two-dimensional MXenes analogue support for room temperature NO2 sensing,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.MXenes are promising supports for anchoring metal single atoms due to their versatile composition, well-defined nanostructures, and suitable conductivity. However, metal single atoms are usually coordinated with surface terminal groups (-O, -OH, -Cl, etc.) of MXenes via conventional wet-impregnation, resulting in limited electronic structure modification. Through a NiCl2 molten salt etching method, we observed that Ni single atoms could be in-situ doped in the lattice of MXenes analogue TiC0.5N0.5 support (denoted as Ni1/TiC0.5N0.5), resulting in much larger charge transfer from Ni atoms to adjacent Ti atoms, and thus increasing the electronic density of these Ti atoms. When used for NO2 sensing, Ni1/TiC0.5N0.5 exhibited excellent response sensitivity (ultra-low limit of detection ∼ 10 ppb), selectivity, and good stability at room temperature. This study provides an effective strategy for producing MXenes analogue supported metal single atoms for potential application in gas sensing. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano Research

A high-performance biomass carbon separator loaded with MnO2 designed for lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Masson SASLithium polysulfide (LPS) is a crucial component obstructing the cycle performance of Li–S battery. At the same time, the utilization of agricultural waste straws has been in the stage of inefficient utilization. Here, the straws were used as raw materials to prepare the Mn-doped biomass carbon-loaded separator. The as-prepared separator not only provided abundant functional group sites for adsorbing and catalyzing LPS, but also offered the electronic transport paths to improve rate performance. At the same time, this separator reduced the density per unit area of lithium ions, guided Li-ions for uniform deposition and greatly decreased the generation of lithium dendrites. Thanks to the above-mentioned advantages, the Li–S battery prepared by the separator possessed excellent electrochemical performances. More importantly, under harsh conditions (sulfur load = 6 mg/cm2, lithium foil = 50 μm, E/S = 5), the modified sample still had higher capacity and retention rate.",Solid State Sciences

Regulation of bioinspired ion diodes: From fundamental study to blue energy harvesting,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdIonic current rectification (ICR) phenomenon occurs in potassium channels embedded in the biological cell membranes, which is that ions can be translocated predominately only in one direction (inwards or outwards across the membrane), underlying the electric power generation in electric eels. Inspired by this, artificial ion diodes with ICR behaviors based on asymmetric nanochannels have been developed for both fundamental study and practical applications. In this review, we focus on the underlying mechanism and main influencing factors of the ICR behavior, which lay the foundation of ion diodes, and reviewed the corresponding regulation strategies in diverse bioinspired artificial nanochannels with various dimensions and structures. We systematically classified the regulation methods into five categories according to the fundamental parameters affecting the rectification, including: geometry, electrolyte, surface charge, wettability and working mode. Based on this fundamental research, ICR properties have been recently introduced into blue energy harvester systems, enabling high power generation performance. Furthermore, we put up some ideas on how to face the changing salinity environment for ion diodes, especially in hypersaline environment, which plays a vital role in water-nexus energy science.

Cyclohexane and n-hexane adsorption studies on novel hex-star antimonene nanosheets – A first-principles outlook,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The presence of acetic acid, nitrates, vat dyes, and heavy metals all collectively produce highly toxic effluent from the textile industry. The aliphatic hydrocarbons, namely cyclohexane, and n-hexane are the common toxic volatiles emitted from the various textile industry in worldwide leading to environmental degradation and human illnesses. Hence, there is a requirement for high sensitivity and a stable chemical sensor for detecting these toxic molecules to safeguard human health and the air atmosphere. In this research, we used hex-star antimonene as a leading sensing material to detect cyclohexane and n-hexane molecules at ambient temperature. Originally, the structural firmness of hex-star antimonene is validated with the influence of cohesive formation energy. Furthermore, the band structure and projected density of states spectrum provides the fingerprint for electronic properties of hex-star antimonene. The band gap of hex-star antimonene is calculated to be 0.862 eV. Significantly, the adsorption properties of cyclohexane and n-hexane on the base substrate are investigated by the deciding factors, such as Bader charge transfer, adsorption energy, and relative band gap variations. The scope of adsorption energy (−0.115 eV to −0.502 eV) confirms that both cyclohexane and n-hexane are physisorbed on hex-star antimonene. The outcome recommended that hex-star antimonene can be utilised as a chemical sensor to monitor the cyclohexane and n-hexane emitted from textile industries.",Inorganic Chemistry Communications
Advanced sodium-ion capacitor based on antimony-carbon composite anode,"© 2022, Youke Publishing Co.,Ltd.Alloy-type materials with the characteristics of high theoretical capacity, low sodiation/desodiation potential, and good conductivity are considered as one of the most promising anodes for sodium-ion batteries or capacitors. However, the large volume change during the sodiation leads to poor cyclability and slow kinetics, thus presenting the main issue impeding the practical application. Herein, we propose a facile wet chemistry and pyrolysis method to synthesize Sb-carbon composite that Sb nanoparticles or single atoms are confined and/or dispersed in the wrinkled carbon framework with high nitrogen content. This unique architecture of Sb-carbon composite increases atomic interface contact/interaction with Na+, facilitating ion diffusion and alleviating the volume change of Sb during the charge/discharge process. Half-cell test shows that Sb-carbon composite exhibits a high-rate capability and stable cycling life. Furthermore, sodium-ion capacitors fabricated by employing Sb-carbon composite as anode and home-made active carbon as cathode, deliver both high-energy density of 157 Wh·kg−1 and high-power density of 25 kW·kg−1 as well as excellent cycling performance exceeding 4000 cycles.

Magnetic Fe/carbon/sodium alginate hydrogels for efficient degradation of norfloxacin in simulated wastewater,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe activation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by Fe/carbon composites has been widely used for the removal of antibiotics. However, the secondary pollution of iron ions limits the application of Fe2+/H2O2 system. In this work, three kinds of hydrogel materials combining metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived magnetic Fe/porous carbon (MagFePC) with sodium alginate (SA), polyacrylic acid (PAA) and agarose (AG) were prepared by different methods for removal of norfloxacin (NOR) antibiotics in simulated wastewater. After comparison, MagFePC/SA hydrogels synthesized by a titration forming method were found to have the advantages of good toughness, abundant pores and best Fenton activity. MagFePC/SA can effectively activate H2O2 to remove NOR under neutral conditions, and there was almost no leaching of iron ions, causing no secondary pollution to the environment. The effects of pH, ionic strength and surfactants on the degradation performance for NOR were studied. Mechanism study revealed that ·O2− and 1O2 were the main active species for the degradation of NOR, and the materials still had good stability and reusability after repeated cycles. More important, we built a simple automated unit for wastewater treatment under laboratory conditions that can completely degrade a 5 mg/L NOR solution at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Current works showed that MagFePC/SA had the advantages of simple synthesis, outstanding degradability, excellent stability and eco-friendly reaction, which was a wastewater treatment material with good prospect for industrial application.",Journal of Cleaner Production
Electronic structure adjustment of lithium sulfide by a single-atom copper catalyst toward high-rate lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022Electrocatalytically reducing the energy barrier for Li2S deposition/dissociation is a promising strategy for high-rate Li-S batteries. However, the catalytic sites would be covered by the insulating Li2S product during discharge, which deteriorates the catalytic activity. Here, suggested by first-principles calculations, single-atom copper (SA-Cu) was screened out to endow the insulator-to-metal transition of adsorbed Li2S in view of the electronic structure. In addition to the thermodynamically reduced redox energy barrier, metallic Li2S nuclei deposited on SA-Cu decorated nitrogen-doped carbon fiber foam (SA-Cu@NCNF) with favorable electronic transport present 3D spherical clusters rather than conventional 2D lateral morphology by continuous 3D nucleation and growth. The Li2S deposition capacity and the catalytic efficiency of Li2S-covered catalytic sites are thus greatly improved. As a result, SA-Cu@NCNF based Li-S cells with a sulfur loading of 4 mg cm−2 retained an areal capacity of 1.60 mAh cm−2 at 5 C after 500 cycles (0.038% decay per cycle). A competitive areal capacity of 8.44 mAh cm−2 was obtained at 0.2 C with a sulfur loading of 10 mg cm−2. The demonstration of the distinctive design of catalysts to adjust the electronic structure of adsorbed Li2S paves the way for developing high-rate and long-life Li-S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials

Cobalt-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets with enhanced oxidase-like activity for detecting perfluorooctane sulfonate,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this study, we used leaf-like zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-L) as the precursor, CoAc2⋅4H2O as the Co source, and 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) as the N source to synthesize the cobalt-embedded nitrogen-carbon nanosheet (CoNCN) with enhanced enzyme-like activity. A variety of characterizations proved that the ultra-thin two-dimensional nanosheet structure of the CoNCN with both micropores and mesopores exposes more Co-Nx active sites, which makes it easier for the colorimetric substrate to contact the CoNCN's surface. Compared with the Co-NC (the synthesized product without using Phen) and NC (the synthesized product without using CoAc2⋅4H2O) controls, the optimized CoNCN nanozyme exhibits 2.3-fold and 12.3-fold enhancement of oxidase-like activity, and 1.3-fold and 25.0-fold enhancement of catalase-like activity, respectively. In addition, the CoNCN has a high affinity for TMB, with a Km value of 0.53 mM and a Vmax value of 3.24 × 10-7 M s−1. The mechanism investigation indicated that the •OH, O2•− and 1O2 were reactive oxygen species responsible for the oxidase-like activity of CoNCN. The perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) can fade the blue oxTMB. Based on this, an analytical method based on a colorimetric strategy coupled to classical univariate calibration was established for the sensitive detection of PFOS, with a linear range of 0.01 to 100 μM, and the limit of detection (LOD) of 20 nM according to modern IUPAC definition. The proposed method was successfully used to determine the concentration of PFOS in actual water samples.",Microchemical Journal
"Synthesis, properties, and applications of carbyne nanocrystals","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Since the first observation of fullerene nearly three decades ago, allotropes of carbon, including carbon nanotube and graphene, have been the focus of considerable research because of their remarkable physical and chemical properties that suggest the potential for a wide variety of practical applications. Well known, in terms of carbon-atom hybridization, well-established forms of carbon are diamond with the three-dimensional sp3-hybridized carbon atoms and graphite with the two-dimensional sp2-hybridized carbon atoms which have been known and utilized for millennia. Additionally, more carbon allotropes, such as fullerenes, nanotubes and graphene composed of sp2-hybridized carbon, and Lonsdaleite and C8 composed of sp3-hybridized carbon each show unique properties, usually different from those of either diamond or graphite, offering technological breakthroughs. Sequentially, there is the third carbon, i.e., carbyne with the one-dimensional sp-hybridization, which would result in an allotrope of carbon, whereas diamond and graphite feature three- and two-dimensional ones, respectively. Recently, carbyne nanocrystals (CNCs), the condensed phase of carbyne with the finite chain length and the one-dimensional sp-hybridized carbon atoms with the alternating carbon–carbon single and triple bonds, the dubbed the third carbon, have been synthesized in the laboratory (Science Advances 2015; 1 (9): e1500857), and these CNCs are white powders, so they are called white carbon. Interestingly, there have been many works showing that CNCs possess potential applications in luminescence, nonlinear optics, optoelectronic sensing and biomedicine probes. Therefore, these findings above imply that we have being on the threshold of a new era of carbyne science and technology. This review aims to be a comprehensive, authoritative, critical, and accessible review of general interest to the material community. Therefore, the review will survey the latest progresses of CNCs, provide a comprehensive understanding of synthesis, structure, property, and applications of CNCs, and put forward the perspective for the further development of CNCs. Firstly, we will present the basic understanding of classification and definition of carbyne. The history of carbyne research will be introduced and different definitions of carbyne in different periods are summarized. Next, a reasonable classification of carbyne research is proposed. Secondly, we will briefly introduce various approaches for the synthesis of carbyne and focus on describing LAL technique which is more suitable to produce CNCs compared with other methods. Thirdly, we will summarize structure, properties, and related applications of CNCs, including electronics, optics and magnetism, and optoelectronic and biomedical applications.

Advances in High Sulfur Loading Cathodes for Practical Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Energy Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium-sulfur batteries hold great potential for next-generation energy storage systems, due to their high theoretical energy density and the natural abundance of sulfur. Although much progress has been achieved recently, the low actual energy density of Li-S batteries is still the key challenge in implementing their practical applications. Because the energy density greatly depends on the areal capacity of their sulfur cathodes, the sulfur content and sulfur loading play an important role in meeting the conditions necessary for practical applications. Therefore, escalating the areal capacity of sulfur cathodes is essential to promote Li-S technology from laboratory-scale devices to industrial (or commercial) systems. In this review, the recent progress in high sulfur loading of Li-S batteries (>4 mg cm−2) is highlighted from various aspects, including sulfur hosts, binders, separators, and interlayers. In particular, sulfur hosts derived from carbon, polymer, transition metal oxide/ sulfide, metal-organic framework, and other novel materials, which can promote high sulfur loading, are discussed in detail.

Ultrahigh-Content Co-P Cluster as a Dual-Atom-Site Electrocatalyst for Accelerating Polysulfides Conversion in Li–S Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) show high catalytic efficiency in accelerating conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS), and are thus promising for suppressing the shuttle effect observed in lithium−sulfur batteries (LSBs); however, single-atom catalytic sites with low content of catalysts largely restrict their catalytic effect. Herein, a Co-P cluster supported by a N-doped carbon matrix (Co-P cluster/NC) with atomic-level dispersion and an ultrahigh content (25.5 wt.%) of Co atoms is fabricated via an in situ low-temperature phosphorization strategy and employed as a dual-atom-site catalyst for catalyzing LiPS conversion. The Co-P cluster/NC with abundant unsaturated Co-P coordination provides dual-atom sites of Co and P to dynamically adsorb/desorb sulfur species and Li+ ions, respectively, synergistically promoting the conversion of LiPS. The dual-atom-site catalytic mechanism is evidenced by substantial characterizations including X-ray absorption fine structure measurements and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, the S@Co-P cluster/NC cathode shows superior cycling and rate performance. Even at a high sulfur loading of 6.2 mg cm−2, a high areal capacity of 6.5 mAh cm−2 that surpasses most commercial lithium–ion batteries can be achieved. This study opens a new avenue in the development of advanced catalysts with new catalytic mechanisms for high-performance LSBs.",Advanced Functional Materials
Enhanced cathode materials for advanced lithium-ion batteries using nickel-rich and lithium/manganese-rich LiNixMnyCozO2,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdFossil fuel consumption raises the world's economy by causing severe ecological effects. Thus, contemplating an energy gadget with environmentally friendly behavior would be a desirable function. Furthermore, their advancement will aid in a dramatic increase in military resources and energy storage. Lithium-ion batteries paid more attention to offering high capacity and stability compared to other batteries. Specifically, the LiNixMnyCozO2(NMC) cathode achieves excellent specific capacity and cyclability, but with different effects like the deposition of residual lithium over the surface, ion mixing, oxygen release, dissolution of transition metal ions, and irreversible rock-salt phase transformation. Moreover, the idea of doping and coating will make the cathode efficient. The doping of materials like Al, Mg, Cr, and F makes an excellent stable cathode due to their strong bonding with oxygen atoms and also helps to increase the lattice parameter size during cycling for Li+ ion diffusion. Likewise, the coating covers the cathode surface and protects it from the electrolyte. Besides, there was no single counter to rectify all these drawbacks. Thus, the combination of two or more strategies can be a better idea to suppress these drawbacks and provide the NMC cathode with high stability, excellent cyclability, and rate capability for practical applications.",Journal of Energy Storage
Multiple-Scale Probing of Intrinsic Active Sites and Reaction Kinetics in Processable Cation-Inserted Nickel Hydroxide Films,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Nanoplate-shaped Ni(OH)2 with numerous exposed active sites hold much promise for high-performance energy storage devices. However, restricted by the wide band gap, which leads to a low concentration of charge carrier, the energy barrier of electron mobility in lattice plane is high, further inhibiting the electron transfer and their practical application. Here, several unique processable nickel-based hydroxide films are constructed via the cation-inserted strategy to probe the intrinsic relationship between component and electronic micro-structure. Benefiting from the component-driven effects, the concentration of charge carrier at the lattice plane can be accumulated after injecting heterogeneous cations, and the fastened dynamics process can be realized and confirmed by multiple real-time operando techniques. Meanwhile, the more well-matched Co core rather than Mn core in Ni(OH)2 is also certified. Finally, the Co-Ni(OH)2 electrode achieves 623 C g–1 @1 A g–1 without any conductivity additives and binders, which is nearly threefold that of pristine Ni(OH)2. This work clarifies the critical role of inserted cations, and corresponding electron and electrolyte ion transfer across the matrix, thus enabling a better guideline for Ni(OH)2-based energy storage/conversion systems.",Advanced Functional Materials
Dawson-type polyoxometalate modified separator for anchoring/catalyzing polysulfides in high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022Considering ultrahigh energy density as well as the cost-effectiveness of lithium-sulfur batteries (Li-S, LSBs), it is considered the most outstanding battery. However, the shuttling behavior and sluggish conversion of polysulfides (LiPSs), and the dendrite formation seriously impede the practical applications of LSBs. The modified separator is an effective method to solve the above problems. Herein, we propose a Dawson-type polyoxometalate (K6P2W18O62, P2W18) modified polypropylene membrane (P2W18/PVDF/PP) with multiple functions for inhibiting the diffusion of LiPSs, promoting the redox kinetics of LiPSs conversion, avoiding the dendrite formation, and promoting Li+ rapid transfer. Based on spectroscopic techniques as well as electrochemical dates, it was confirmed that P2W18 can effectively adsorb LiPSs and accelerate LiPSs conversion kinetics to improve the electrochemical performance of LSBs. As a result, LSBs with P2W18/PVDF/PP separator show an initial specific capacity of 724 mAh g–1 at 3.0 C with excellent cycling stability over 400 cycles. The result offers a new perspective for exploring the role of Dawson-type polyoxometalate in extending cycling life and increasing specific capacity in LSBs.",Electrochimica Acta
Mo2N Quantum Dots Decorated N-Doped Graphene Nanosheets as Dual-Functional Interlayer for Dendrite-Free and Shuttle-Free Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The industrialization of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries is simultaneously impeded by the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and dendrites growth on lithium anode. To address both issues, a novel sulfiphilic and lithiophilic interlayer of Mo2N quantum dots decorated N-doped graphene-nanosheet (Mo2N@NG) are presented on polypropylene separator via a facile scalable method. Benefiting from the strong chemisorption ability, eminent electrocatalysis for LiPSs, and high chemical affinity with lithium-ion (Li+), Mo2N@NG can efficiently catalyze the rapid transformation of LiPSs and induce uniform deposition of Li+. Theoretical calculation and in situ Raman synergistically elucidate the inhibition of shuttle effect and alleviation of dendrite growth. As a result, the assembled Li–S cell with Mo2N@NG/PP separator exhibits remarkable rate performance (860.2 mA h g–1 at 4 C), good cycling stability (0.039% capacity decay per cycle after 800 cycles at 2 C), a high areal capacity of 3.89 mA h cm–2 of Li–S pouch cell (4.5 mg cm–2 and 6 µL mg–1 at 0.2 C), and steady performance in protecting the lithium anode (at 5 mA cm–2 for 1500 h). This present strategy of quantum dots in a hybrid framework has great potential to be generalized to other transition metal-based catalysts for advanced Li–S batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials

The FeCoNi-LDHs exhibit a hierarchical yolk-shell structure, with numerous ultra-thin hydroxide nanosheets forming the walls. Because of its unique structure and composition, FeCoNi-LDH-5 only requires an overpotential of 252 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2and exhibits excellent electrochemical stability.

Recent advances in modulation engineering-enabled metal compounds for potassium-ion storage,"© 2022Developing advanced energy storage technologies beyond lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) to meet the demand of large-scale energy storage with sustainability and low cost are urgent. The potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) and potassium-ion capacitors (PICs) by using the K+-ion as charge carriers have received more and more attention, due to the low standard redox potential of K/K+, high ionic conductivity in K-salt-containing electrolytes and cost effectiveness as well as earth abundance of potassium resources. However, the poor kinetics process and huge volume expansion caused by the large radius of K+-ion become the main challenges for PIBs and PICs anode materials. In recent years, ever-increasing investigations have been reported on metal compounds (MCs) with high theoretical capacity, low cost, moderate operation potential, environmental friendliness, abundant resources and redox reversibility as K+-ion storage anode materials. However, their potassium storage drawbacks such as intrinsic poor charge transfer kinetics process and weak structural stability become more important to adopt advanced structural engineering and thus enhance the potassium storage performance. Along this line, the recent research advances in performing modulation engineering on MCs for potassium storage are summarized in this review, including interface engineering with rich heterostructure and phase boundary, confine engineering with safe storage space and defect engineering with improved intrinsic physicochemical properties.

"Density-Generalized Theory Study of Electronic Structure, Magnetic, and Optical Properties of Mn-Doped and Mn-X (X = B, C, N, O, and F) Co-doped Arsenenes","© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The structural stability, electronic structure, and magnetic and optical properties of intrinsic arsenene, Mn-doped, and Mn-X (X = B, C, N, O, and F) co-doped (X atoms replace three As atoms around Mn atoms) arsenene were studied using the GGA + U plane wave super soft pseudopotential method in the framework of spin density-generalized theory. Intrinsic arsenenes are indirect bandgap 1.602 eV non-magnetic semiconductors. All doped systems produce magnetic properties, and Mn-doped (Mn–C and Mn–N co-doped) monolayer arsenene system becomes a half-metal (HM) ferromagnet with 100% spin polarization and can be used in spintronic devices. The Mn–B co-doped system exhibits dilute magnetic semiconductor properties compared to intrinsic arsenene, and both Mn–O and Mn–F co-doped systems exhibit metallic properties. There is a strong charge transfer in the co-doped system, where all Mn atoms lose electrons and all X (X = B, C, N, O, and F) atoms gain electrons. Comparing the formation energies, the formation energies are significantly reduced after doping, where the Mn–N co-doped system has the lowest formation energy, indicating the most stable structure. The Mn–O co-doped monolayer arsenene system has the highest static dielectric constants ε1(0) and ε2(0). The doped system has a significant red shift at the edge of the absorption band and the range of the absorption spectrum is broadened. The reflectance of intrinsic arsenene to light at 6–10 eV is much greater than that of the doped system.",Journal of Superconductivity and Novel Magnetism

With the multi-scenario applications of AZIBs, the operation of AZIBs at extreme temperature poses critical challenges. Nevertheless, the failure mechanism of AZIBs under extreme temperature remains unclear, which hinders the establishment of corresponding modification means. Rather than simply summarizing recent advances, this review comprehensively provides insights from theory to application. Theoretically, the reasons for performance degradation under extreme temperature are explored in depth from thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives, encompassing critical factors such as ion diffusion, redox reactions on the electrode surface, and polarization. Practically, the challenges of AZIBs at low/high temperature are critically appraised, chiefly in terms of electrolyte icing, increased polarization, decreased ionic conductivity, severe side reactions, material dissolution, and thermal runaway. Subsequently, effective strategies to overcome these obstacles and optimize electrochemical performance are concluded. Finally, the possible challenges of batteries at extreme temperature and future development directions are discussed.",Energy Storage Materials
"Iron (Fe, Ni, Co)-based transition metal compounds for lithium-sulfur batteries: Mechanism, progress and prospects","© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesLithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have a high theoretical capacity, which is considered as one of the most promising high-energy–density secondary batteries due to the double electrons reaction of sulfur. However, the shuttle effects of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish redox kinetics lead to their materials capacity loss and cycle stability deterioration, which restrains LSBs commercialization. Metallic compounds as additions can improve the electrochemical performance of the Li–S system, through the trap of LiPSs and accelerate the conversion of the soluble LiPSs. Among of them, the iron group elements (Fe, Ni, Co)-based compounds are the promising materials for the LSBs, due to their unique outer electronic structure and its tunable properties, low cost, abundant in the earth, environmental benignity, controllable and scalable prepared, and so on.

Enhancing anchoring and catalytic conversion of polysulfides by nitrogen deficient cobalt nitride for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022While lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery has attracted remarkable attention owing to the high theoretical capacity, its practical application is still hindered by the shuttle and sluggish conversion kinetics of intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Defect engineering, which can regulate the electronic structure and in turn influence the surface adsorption and catalytic capability, has been regarded as a feasible strategy to deal with the above challenges. However, few studies on nitrogen vacancies and their mechanisms are reported. Herein, cobalt nitride with nitrogen vacancies grown on multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT-CoN-VN) is designed and applied as the separator modification material to investigate the enhancing mechanism of nitrogen vacancies on Li-S batteries. The experimental evidence and theoretical calculation indicate that the introduction of nitrogen vacancies into cobalt nitride can enhance the chemical affinity to LiPSs and effectively hamper the shuttle effect. Meanwhile the reduced band gap of the d-band center of Co and p-band center of N for CNT-CoN-VN and the promoted diffusion of Li+ can expedite the solid–liquid and liquid–liquid conversions of sulfur species. Due to these superiorities, the cell with CNT-CoN-VN modified separator delivers a favorable initial capacity of 901 mAh g−1 and a capacity of 660 mAh g−1 can be achieved after 250 cycles at 2 C. This work explores the application of metal nitride with nitrogen vacancies and sheds light on the development of functional separators for high-efficient Li-S batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Unraveling the morphological evolution mechanism of solid sulfur species in lithium-sulfur batteries with operando light microscopy,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesSolid-liquid phase conversion between various sulfur species in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is a fundamental reaction of the sulfur cathode. Disclosing the morphological evolution of solid sulfur species upon cycling is of great significance to achieving high energy densities. However, an in-depth investigation of the internal reaction is still lacking. In this work, the evolution process of solid sulfur species on carbon substrates is systematically studied by using an operando light microscope combined with in situ electrochemical impedance spectra technology. The observation of phenomena such as bulk solid sulfur species can form and dissolve independently of the conductive substrates and the transformation of supercooled liquid sulfur to crystalline sulfur. Based on the phenomena mentioned above, a possible mechanism was proposed in which the dissolution reaction of solid sulfur species is a spatially free reaction that involves isotropic physical dissolution, diffusion of molecules, and finally the electrochemical reaction. Correspondingly, the formation of solid sulfur species tends to be a form of crystallization in a saturated solution rather than electrodeposition, as is commonly believed. Our findings offer new insights into the reaction of sulfur cathodes and provide new opportunities to design advanced sulfur cathodes for Li-S batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

Enhancing Li-ion conduction and mechanical properties via addition of fluorine-containing metal—organic frameworks in all-solid-state cross-linked hyperbranched polymer electrolytes,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are commonly used in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) for their good Li-salt solvating ability and easy processability. However, the relatively low Li-ion conduction ability hinders their further development. In this work, a novel hyperbranched-polyether-type composite solid polymer electrolyte (CSPE) is prepared via a quick cross-linking reaction between aldehyde-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG) and hyperbranched poly(ethylene imine) (HPEI) in the presence of lithium salt and fluorine-containing Zr-based metal—organic framework (MOF) UiO-66-(F)4. The hydrogen bonds between the fluorine atoms and amino groups in the electrolyte help to the better dispersion of UiO-66-(F)4 in the polymer matrix, which is beneficial to solving the problem of aggregation of nanofillers. Besides, the CSPEs with the functional MOF fillers show improvements in both electrochemical and mechanical properties. Notably, the Li-ion transference number (tLi+) is considerably enhanced from 0.23 to 0.54. All-solid-state LMBs based on the CSPE also present good cycling performances. A high specific discharge capacity of 141.4 mAh·g−1 is remained after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. This study not only provides an effective synthesis method of the cross-linked hyperbranched polymer electrolyte, but also puts forward a new strategy for uniform dispersion of inorganic fillers in CSPEs.

Engineering the morphology and electronic structure of atomic cobalt-nitrogen-carbon catalyst with highly accessible active sites for enhanced oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesThe stabilization of non-precious metals as isolated active sites with high loading density over nitrogen-doped carbon materials is essential for realizing the industrial application of single atom catalysts. However, achieving high loading of single cobalt active sites with greatly enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability remains challenging. Here, an efficient approach was described to create a single atom cobalt electrocatalyst (Co SAs/NC) which possesses enhanced mesoporosity and specific surface area that greatly favor the mass transportation and exposure of accessible active sites. The electronic structure of the catalyst by the strong metal-support interaction has been elucidated through experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Due to dramatically enhanced mass transport and electron transfer endowed by morphology and electronic structure engineering, Co SAs/NC exhibits remarkable ORR performance with excellent activity (onset and half-wave potentials of 1.04 V (RHE) and 0.90 V (RHE), Tafel slope of 69.8 mV dec−1 and Jk of 18.8 mA cm−2 at 0.85 V) and stability (7 mV activity decay after 10,000 cycles).

Electroactive-catalytic conductive framework for aluminum-sulfur batteries,"© 2022Rechargeable aluminum‒sulfur batteries (RASBs), despite the great advantage of high energy density and low cost, are suffering from insulative solid sulfur species and sluggish reaction kinetics. The routine solution of introducing an excessive amount of inactive carbon will cause the low active material's proportion and thus high electrode porosity, dramatically compromising the energy densities. More importantly, the high Gibbs free energy of the Al2S3 decomposition remains unsolved. Herein, an Al3+-intercalative and catalytic electronic conductive framework (ECF) is constructed by Mo6S8 to replace conventional inactive carbon, in which Mo6S8 will build an efficient conductive network, provide high Al-ion storage capability, have a strong affinity to polysulfides to restrain their dissolution, and show superior catalytic activity on the decomposition of Al2S3.

Nanosecond laser lithography enables concave-convex zinc metal battery anodes with ultrahigh areal capacity,"© 2022Laser processing is employed to fabricated zinc-ion battery (ZIB) anodes with state-of-the-art electrochemical performance from commercial zinc foils. Lasers are widely utilized for industrial surface finishing but have received minimal attention for zinc surface modification. Laser lithography patterned zinc foils “LLP@ZF” are hydrophilic, with an electrolyte contact angle of 0°. This is due to the concave-convex surface geometry that enhances wetting (periodic crests, ridges and valleys, roughness 16.5 times planar). During electrodeposition LLP@ZF's surface geometry generates a periodic electric field and associated current density distribution that suppresses tip growth (per continuum simulations). Per Density Functional Theory (DFT) its surface oxide is zincophilic, resulting in low nucleation barriers during plating (e.g. 3.8 mV at 1 mA cm−2). A combination of these attributes leads to stable dendrite-free plating/stripping behavior and low overpotentials at fast charge (e.g. 48.2 mV at 8 mA cm−2 in symmetric cell). Cycling is possible at an unprecedented areal capacity of 50 mA h cm−2, with 400 h stability at 1 mA cm−2. Moreover, exceptional aqueous zinc battery (AZB) performance is achieved, with MnO2-based cathode loading 10 mg cm−2 and corresponding anode capacity 7.6 mA h cm−2. A broad comparison with literature indicates that LLP@ZF symmetric cell and full battery performance are among most favorable.",Energy Storage Materials

Protein-modified SEI formation and evolution in Li metal batteries,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesDespite numerous reported lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with excellent cycling performance achieved in labs, transferring the high performing LMBs from lab-scale to industrial-production remains challenging. Therefore, via imitating the stand-still process in battery production, a conventional but important procedure, to investigate the formation and evolution of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is particularly important for LMBs. Our previous studies indicate that zein (corn protein)-modified carbonate-ester electrolyte (the most commercialized) effectively improves the performance of LMBs through guiding Li-ions and repairing cracked SEI. Herein, we investigate the formation and evolution of the protein-modified SEIs on Li anodes by imitating the stand-still temperature and duration. A simulation study on the protein denaturation in the electrolyte under different temperatures demonstrates a highly unfolded configuration at elevated temperatures. The experiments show that this heat-treated-zein (H-zein) modified SEI forms quickly and becomes stable after a stand-still process of less than 100 min. Moreover, the H-zein SEI exhibits excellent wetting behavior with the electrolyte due to the highly unfolded protein structures with more functional groups exposed. The Li|Li cell with the H-zein SEI achieves prolonged cycling performance (>360 h vs. ∼260 h of the cell with the untreated-zein (U-zein) modified SEI). The LiFePO4|Li cell with the H-zein SEI shows much stable long-term cycling performance of capacity retention (70% vs. 42% of the cell with U-zein SEI) after 200 cycles. This study confirms that the appropriately treated protein is able to effectively improve the performance of LMBs, and will inspire future studies for the production process of LMBs toward their commercialization.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

Battery testing revealed a reversible capacity of 130 mAh g−1, with a capacity retention of up to 87% after 100 cycles at 0.1C, and excellent long-term cycling stability (approximately 71% after 500 cycles at 0.5C). The prepared material also exhibited an outstanding Coulombic efficiency of 98% and a high energy efficiency of 95%. Furthermore, the high entropy effect was investigated using energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure to prove that the material contains a single phase with well-distributed metal ions. The operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction demonstrated that the phase transition was delayed until the extraction of 0.32 sodium ion from NCNFMT, which indicates the stabilization of the O3-phase induced by the high entropy effect. Furthermore, the quasi-solid-state NCNFMT||polyethylene oxide-Na3.2Ca0.1Zr1.9Si2PO12||Na cells exhibited excellent performance with a high discharge capacity of 112 mAh g−1 and retention of 78% after 100 cycles. The above results demonstrate the advantages of HEOs as potential cathode materials for SIBs.",Energy Storage Materials
MXene-based materials for advanced nanogenerators,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdEnergy harvesting devices are in urgent demand to meet the requirements of escalated energy consumption. Nanogenerators as emerging sustainable energy harvesting devices are attracting growing interest owing to the efficient transformation from mechanical energy into electrical energy. Nevertheless, there is still a distance from its commercial use due to the insufﬁcient output performance of nanogenerators. Recently, 2D MXenes for nanogenerators has exhibited substantial encouraging progress owing to their superior merits of electronegativity, metallic conductivity, mechanically flexibility, tunable surface chemistry, etc. Since 2017, the MXenes-based materials for nanogenerators have risen enormously. Nonetheless, comprehensive reviews on this topic are rare. Here, we systematically reviewed the latest progress of MXenes for nanogenerators, aiming to boost scientific design tactics for practical application of nanogenerators from the perspectives of the fundamental principle and latest advances.

Single-atom catalysts modified by molecular groups for electrochemical nitrogen reduction,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is one of the most important chemical reactions for the production of ammonia under ambient environment. However, the lack of in-depth understanding of the structure-activity relationship impedes the development of high-performance catalysts for ammonia production. Herein, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to reveal the structure-activity relationship for the single-atom catalysts (SACs) supported on g-C3N4, which is modified by molecular groups (i.e., H, O, and OH). The computational results demonstrate that the W-based SACs are beneficial to produce ammonia with a low limiting potential (UL). Particularly, the W-OH@g-C3N4 catalyst exhibits an ultralow UL of −0.22 V for eNRR. And the competitive eNRR selectivity can be identified by the dominant *N2 adsorption free energy than that of *H. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the synthesis of efficient catalysts to produce ammonia. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano Research
Recent progress on elemental sulfur based photocatalysts for energy and environmental applications,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe growing needs of the rising population and blatant misuse of resources have contributed enormously to environmental problems. Among the various methods, photocatalysis has emerged as one of the effective remediation methods. The continuous search for effective photocatalysts that can be made from abundant, cheap, non-toxic materials is going on. Although sulfur is a known insulator, recent sulfur use as a visible light photocatalyst has ushered a new era in this direction. Sulfur is a non-toxic, cheap, and abundant photocatalyst, exhibiting significant photocatalytic properties. But, hydrophobicity, poor light-harvesting and high recombination rate of charge carriers in elemental sulfur photocatalyst are some of the major drawbacks of the elemental sulfur photocatalyst. The photocatalytic activity of sulfur as a single element was low, but various methods such as nanoscaling, heterojunction formation, doping and surface modifications have been used to enhance it. The review highlights sulfur's crystal structure, electronic and optical properties, and morphological changes, making it an excellent visible light photocatalyst. The article points to the limitations of sulfur as a single photocatalyst and various strategies to improve the shortcomings. More recently, there has been an emphasis on the synthesis of metal-free photocatalysts. This review provides its readers with a comprehensive detail of sulfur being used as a dopant in improving the photocatalytic properties of metal-free photocatalysts and their environmental remediation use. Finally, the conclusion and future perspectives for sulfur-based nanostructures are presented.",Chemosphere
Dual-functional hosts derived from metal-organic frameworks reduce dissolution of polyselenides and inhibit dendrite growth in a sodium-selenium battery,"© 2022Selenium-based cathodes for sodium-ion batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their high electronic conductivity and volumetric capacity compared to sulfur-based cathodes. However, the use of sodium-selenium batteries has been hindered due to the low selenium reaction activity towards sodium, rapid capacity fading caused by the shuttle effect of polyselenides, and the formation of sodium dendrites on the Na anodes. Herein, starting from the nitrogen and oxygen-containing ligands, two precursors of Ni&Zn-MOF and Zn-MOF were used to fabricate the cathode and anode, respectively. A N,O-codoped porous carbon host decorated with well-dispersed Ni single-atom catalyst was derived from the Ni&Zn-MOF for Se storage. When applied as a cathode in Na-Se batteries, this composite accelerated the reaction kinetics of Se and Na+, and at the same time weakened the Se-Se bond owing to its high adsorption to the Se8 ring, which resulted in a significant improvement of the cycle stability. Meanwhile, a dendrite-free anode was realized by using Zn-MOF derived N,O-codoped porous carbon host, which showed a strong sodiophilic ability for Na metal. As a result, the Na-Se battery employing these two composites as the cathode and anode showed an excellent cycle stability and improved safety.",Energy Storage Materials
Organic Hollow Microstructures with Room Temperature Phosphorescence,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Molecular self-assembly into hollow microstructures has great potential in catalysis, drug delivery, sensors, and nanoreactors. In contrast to well-studied fluorescent hollow microstructures, the assembly of phosphorescent hollow microstructures has not yet been fully demonstrated. Here, two types of hollow microstructures based on organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are prepared through a convenient vapor-phase growth method. The observation of the assembly process and the calculations of surface energy reveal that thermodynamically driven Ostwald ripening process plays an essential role in the formation of tunable hollow structures. The universality of this growth technique for hollow microstructures is further demonstrated in various materials and even composites. Compared with non-hollow structures, the phosphorescent hollow microstructures exhibit high sensitivity to oxygen, indicating the potential of organic hollow microstructure with RTP.",Advanced Optical Materials
From protonation & Li-rich contamination to grain-boundary segregation: Evaluations of solvent-free vs. wet routes on preparing Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesGarnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has been recognized as a candidate solid electrolyte for high-safety Li-anode based solid-state batteries because of its electro-chemical stability against Li-metal and high ionic conductivity. Solvent (e.g., isopropanol (IPA)) has been commonly applied for preparing LLZO powders and ceramics. However, the deterioration of the proton-exchange between LLZO and IPA/absorbed moisture during the mixing and tailoring route has aroused less attention. In this study, a solvent-free dry milling route was developed for preparing the LLZO powders and ceramics. For orthogonal four categories of samples prepared using solvent-free and IPA-assisted routes in the mixing and tailoring processes, the critical evaluation was conducted on the crystallinity, surficial morphology, and contamination of as-calcinated and as-tailored particles, the cross-sectional microstructure of green and sintered pellets, the morphology and electro-chemical properties of grain boundaries in ceramics, as well as the interfacial resistance and performance of Li anode based symmetric batteries. The wet route introduced Li-rich contaminations (e.g., LiOH∙H2O and Li2CO3) onto the surfaces of LLZO particles and Li-Ta-O segregations at the adjacent and triangular grain boundaries. The LLZO solid electrolytes prepared through dry mixing in combination with the dry tailoring route without the use of any solvent were found to the optimal performance. The fundamental material properties in the whole LLZO preparation process were found, which are of guiding significance to the development of LLZO powder and ceramic production craft.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Competing reduction induced homogeneous oxygen doping to unlock MoS2 basal planes for faster polysulfides conversion,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesThe parasitic polysulfides shuttle effect greatly hinders the practical application of lithium sulfur batteries, and this issue can be addressed by promoting polysulfides conversion with catalytic materials such as MoS2. However, the catalytic activity of MoS2 mainly relies on edge sites, but is limited by inert basal planes. We herein report a novel, facile, ethylene glycol enabled competing reduction strategy to dope MoS2 homogeneously with oxygen atoms so that its inert basal planes can be unlocked. Ethylene glycol works as a reducing agent and competes with thiourea to react with ammonium molybdate, leading to insufficient sulfuration of Mo, and consequent formation of O-MoS2. Our theoretical and experimental investigations indicate that the homogeneously distributed O dopants can create abundant adsorption/catalytic sites in the MoS2 basal planes, enlarge the inter-plane distance to promote ion transport, and thus enhance the catalytic conversion of polysulfides. The oxygen doped MoS2 (O-MoS2) is supported on carbon nanosheets (CNS) and the composite (O-MoS2/CNS) is employed to modify the separator of Li–S battery. It gives the battery an initial discharge capacity of 1537 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, and the battery retains a discharge capacity of 545 mAh g−1 after ultra-long 2000 cycles at 1 C, corresponding to a very small cyclic decay rate of 0.0237%. Even under a raising sulfur loading of 8.2 mg cm−2, the Li-S battery also delivers a high discharge capacity (554 mAh g−1) with outstanding cycle stability (84.6% capacity retention) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. Our work provides a novel, facile approach to fabricate highly catalytically active oxygen-doped MoS2 for advanced Li–S batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Immobilizing U cations in Sr2Fe2O6-δ as a new cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.U cations were immobilized in the traditional Sr2Fe2O6-δ (SFO) oxide, which was subsequently evaluated as a cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H–SOFCs). Experimental studies indicated that the U cations could be incorporated into the SFO lattice, forming the new Sr2Fe1.5U0.5O6-δ (SFUO) oxide material. The SFUO material exhibited improved chemical stability than the SFO material, preventing the formation of carbonates after treatment in a CO2 atmosphere. Although the total electrical conductivity was decreased with the U-doping, the surface catalytic activity of SFUO was improved compared with SFO, which was demonstrated by first-principles calculations. The subsequent electrochemical studies indicated that an H–SOFC using the SFUO cathode showed higher fuel cell output and smaller polarization resistance than the SFO cathode. The present study demonstrated that SFO could locate U cations in the lattice, and the produced SFUO oxide exhibited improved performance, suggesting the utilization of SFO cathode in the harsh environment (such as U-containing conditions) would be possible, and the electrochemical performance of the fuel cell is not reduced.",Ceramics International
Ultralong cycle life enabled by in situ growth of CoMo1−xP/Mo heterostructure for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesLithium-sulfur batteries (Li-S batteries) are considered as promising new-generation electrochemical energy storage devices due to their extremely high theoretical energy density (2600 Wh kg−1) and theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g−1). However, numerous problems such as poor conductivity and the shuttle effect during discharge–charge process limit the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this work, porous tubular CoMo1−xP/Mo constructed by in situ growth of metal Mo was designed as the sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries. The introduction of Mo modulated the electronic structure of CoMoP to improve the conductivity of cathode and facilitate the redox kinetics, as well as the CoMo1−xP/Mo heterostructure was beneficial to inhibit the shuttle effect through the interaction with lithium polysulfides, which improved cycling stability. As a result, CoMo1−xP/Mo/S cathode had a low-capacity decay rate of only 0.029% per cycle after 2000 cycles at 0.5 C. This work provided a new perspective for the further design of high-performance lithium-sulfur battery cathode materials.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
S-sphere/C/MoS2 composite for high-performance Lithium–Sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.With the development of energy storage systems, Lithium–Sulfur (Li–S) batteries represent an ideal choice due to extremely high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh/g−1) and energy density (2500 Wh/kg−1) of Sulfur cathode. However, it is a challenge to solve the electroconductibility of Sulfur, shuttle effect of polysulfide and volume expansion. Although tremendous works have been carried out to improve the capacity, the practical application of Li–S batteries is still hindered by low electroconductibility of Sulfur, poor cycle life and low rate performances. Herein, S-sphere/C/MoS2 composite was prepared by the melt diffusion method for the nano-sulfur host. In comparison with the large particles sublimate Sulfur, nano-sulfur particles can shorten the diffusion path of ions and facilitate the smooth diffusion of Li+ into the interior of Sulfur at high discharging current densities. Therefore, the formation of insulating Li2S2 and Li2S is delayed. Moreover, the Few-layered MoS2 can be used to achieve chemical adsorption with Lithium polysulfide (LiPS) and Carbon spheres has good electronic conductivity, thus the rate performance and the cyclic capability of Li–S batteries have been improved. The S-sphere/C/MoS2 composite exhibits an initial discharging capacity of 1016.3 mAh/g−1 at 0.1 C, and a high capacity of 753 mAh/g−1 at 1 C with a low fade rate of 0.211%. These indicate that the S-sphere/C/MoS2 composite has good electrochemical performance and is expected to be a candidate electrode for Li–S batteries industrialization in the future.",Ceramics International
In-situ embedding CoTe catalyst into 1D–2D nitrogen-doped carbon to didirectionally regulate lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been widely investigated attributed to their advantages of high energy density and cost effectiveness. However, it is still limited by the uncontrolled shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode and the promiscuous dendrite growth over the lithium anode. To handle the above issues, the highly conductive CoTe catalyst is precisely loaded onto nitrogen-doped nanotube and graphene-like carbon (CoTe⊂NCGs), which is employed as a bi-functionally integrated host. On the lithium anode, the CoTe⊂NCGs with excellent lithiophilic property effectively regulate the uniform deposition of lithium and achieve the effect of suppressing the disorderly growth of lithium dendrites. On the sulfur cathode, the electrochemical conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is catalyzed to mitigate the notorious shuttle effect. In view of the bifunctionality of CoTe⊂NCGs, the assembled full cell can be steadily stable even for 800 cycles at a high rate of 2 C, and the capacity decay rate is only 0.05% per cycle. The areal capacity of 6.0 mAh·cm−2 is well retained after 50 cycles under the conditions of high sulfur loading, poor electrolyte (a low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio, E/S = 4.2), and low negative to positive capacity ratio (N/P=1.6:1).

Compared with other 2D materials and bulk materials, Xenes may exhibit some great superiorities for Li/Na storage, including excellent conductivity, fast ion diffusion and large active sites exposure. In this review, we provide a systematic summary of the recent progress and achievements of Xenes as well as their applications in LIBs/SIBs. The broad categorization of Xenes from group IIIA to VIA has been concisely outlined, and the related details in syntheses, structures and Li/Na-ion storage properties are reviewed. Further, the latest research progress of Xenes in Li/Na ion batteries are summarized, together with mechanism discussions. Finally, the challenges and prospects of Xenes applied to Li/Na ion battery are proposed based on its current developments.",Chemical Record
Covalent Triazine Frameworks and Porous Carbons: Perspective from an Azulene-Based Case,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are among the most valuable frameworks owing to many fantastic properties. However, molten salt-involved preparation of CTFs at 400–600 °C causes debate on whether CTFs represent organic frameworks or carbon. Herein, new CTFs based on the 1,3-dicyanoazulene monomer (CTF-Azs) are synthesized using molten ZnCl2 at 400–600 °C. Chemical structure analysis reveals that the CTF-Az prepared at low temperature (400 °C) exhibits polymeric features, whereas those prepared at high temperatures (600 °C) exhibit typical carbon features. Even after being treated at even higher temperatures, the CTF-Azs retain their rich porosity, but the polymeric features vanish. Although structural de-conformation is a widely accepted outcome in polymer-to-carbon rearrangement processes, the study evaluates such processes in the context of CTF systems. A proof-of-concept study is performed, observing that the as-synthesized CTF-Azs exhibit promising performance as cathodes for Li- and K-ion batteries. Moreover, the as-prepared NPCs exhibit excellent catalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance; hence, they can be used as air cathodes in Zn-air batteries. This study not only provides new building blocks for novel CTFs with controllable polymer/carbon features but also offers insights into the formation and structure transformation history of CTFs during thermal treatment.",Macromolecular Rapid Communications

The chemistry of metal–organic frameworks with face-centered cubic topology,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The precise control of molecular building blocks (MBBs) permits access to various types of tailor-made functional materials. The best example of this is in the assembly of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) comprising many types and arrangements of pre-designed organic and inorganic MBBs. A MOF platform that has garnered particular attention, given its utility and fidelity in many different environments, is the fcu-MOF – a three-dimensional structure that is constructed from linking 12-coordinated face-centered cubic MBBs together. Since the discovery of the first Zr6 oxocluster-based fcu-MOF, known as UiO-66, there has been substantial progress in the synthesis of structures with varying metrics, but with the same underlying fcu topology. This family of fcu-MOFs has later evolved to incorporate isostructural, hexanuclear non-zirconium metal clusters, including rare earth, actinide and other transition metals as inorganic MBBs. Additionally, the versatility of the fcu-MOF platform for design has also attracted researchers to go beyond in situ generated hexanuclear metal clusters to transition metal-based non-hexanuclear metal oxocluster MBBs and metal–organic polyhedra (MOP) supermolecular building blocks (SBBs). All in all, reported fcu-MOFs are endowed with a wide range of porosity and framework chemistry, which has led to their applicability across energy and environmental sustainability issues of societal importance. In this review, a comprehensive assessment will be directed toward the synthesis and applications of fcu-MOFs with particular focus on the chemistry of the MBBs/SBBs and their resulting structure–property relationships. The synthetic and structural characterization challenges will be detailed with future opportunities becoming clear in the process.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Engineering functional mesoporous materials from plant polyphenol based coordination polymers,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The conversion of metal–organic hybrids (e.g., metal–organic frameworks) into functional nanoporous materials has attracted intensive attention because nanoporous materials show tailorable compositions and nanoarchitectures, as well as broad potential applications in energy, environment, sensor and biomedicine. Plant polyphenols, as ubiquitous biomass, reveal low cost, nontoxicity, strong metal chelate ability and good adhesive property towards various substrates. Plant polyphenols and their coordination polymers have recently been regarded as a powerful tool for engineering functional nanomaterials. Herein, the recent progress of plant polyphenol-based coordination polymers and their derived functional mesoporous materials have been comprehensively reviewed. Firstly, based on the strong interactions between polyphenols and various assembly units (e.g., metal ions, soft-template) or substrates (e.g., polystyrene sphere), metal-polyphenol coordination polymers (MPCPs) with capsule structure, crystalline framework, colloidal spheres or mesoporous network can be prepared. Secondly, polyphenols are regarded as an excellent sustainable carbon source. When metal-polyphenol coordination polymers are used as a carbon precursor, mesoporous carbon materials including pure carbon, heteroatom doping, or metal nanoparticle loading are prepared. Thirdly, due to the tunable compositions of MPCPs, mesoporous metal oxide spheres with tunable metal species, solid or hollow structure, complex compositions (e.g., multi-metals or high-entropy metal oxides) are prepared. Fourthly, the applications of MPCPs derived mesoporous materials, including energy conversion and storage, environmental remediation and biomedicine, have been summarized. Compared with the most commonly used metal–organic frameworks, MPCPs are constructed from renewable plant polyphenols. Most importantly, polyphenols are one kind molecular glue and can interact with various molecules. Various components can be incorporated into the MPCPs. MPCPs can also be deposited on various substrates. After thermal decomposition, functional nanoporous composites and films are obtained. We believe this review will bride the polyphenol chemistry with nanoporous materials and promote the creation of more functional porous materials from polyphenols.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews

Recent Advances in Solar Rechargeable Seawater Batteries Based on Semiconductor Photoelectrodes,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.With the ever-increasing demand for energy in the world, the tendency to use renewable energies has been growing rapidly. Sunlight, as an inexhaustible energy source, and the oceans, as one of the most valuable treasures on Earth, are available for free. Simultaneous exploitation of these two sources of energy and matter (sunlight and oceans) in one configuration can provide a sustainable solution for future energy supply. Among the various types of such energy storage and conversion systems, solar rechargeable seawater batteries (SRSBs) can meet this need by storing the chemical energy of seawater by receiving solar energy. SRSBs consist of two compartments: a closed compartment including a sodium metal anode in an organic liquid electrolyte, and an open compartment containing a semiconductor photoelectrode immersed in seawater, which are separated from each other by a ceramic solid electrolyte membrane. In this complex system, the photoelectrode is irradiated by sunlight, whereby electrons are excited and reach the Na metal anode after passing though the external circuit. The ceramic solid electrolyte harvests only sodium ions from seawater and transfers them to the anodic part, where the transferred ions are reduced to sodium metal atoms. At the same time, an oxygen evolution reaction takes place at the cathodic part. In this way, the battery is charged. The use of a photoelectrode in the charging process significantly increases the voltage efficiency of SRSBs to more than 90%, whereas a cell with only the seawater compartment (without a photoelectrode) will not deliver satisfactory performance. Therefore, to achieve very high efficiencies, designing an accurate system with the best components is absolutely necessary. This review focuses on the working principle of SRSBs, at the same time explaining the effect of key components on the performance and stability of SRSBs. The role of the semiconductor photoelectrode in improving the voltage efficiency of SRSBs is also described in detail, and finally strategies proposed to overcome obstacles to the commercialization of SRSBs are introduced.",Topics in Current Chemistry
MOF based electrochemical sensors for the detection of physiologically relevant biomolecules: An overview,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.It is known that biomolecules are physiologically significant in controlling homeostasis. Any deviation in homeostasis is often detected by a change in the concentrations of these biomolecules.

The Catalyst Design for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: Roles and Routes,"© 2022 The Chemical Society of Japan & Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium-sulfur battery is a promising candidate for next-generation high energy density batteries due to its ultrahigh theoretical energy density. However, it suffers from low sulfur utilization, fast capacity decay, and the notorious “shuttle effect” of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) due to the sluggish reaction kinetics, which severely restrict its practical applications. Using the electrocatalyst can accelerate the redox reactions between sulfur, LiPSs and Li2S and suppress the shuttling of LiPSs, and thus, it is a promising strategy to solve the above problems, enabling the battery with high energy density and long cycling stability. In this personal account, we discuss the catalyst design for lithium-sulfur batteries according to the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and sulfur evolution reaction (SER) in the discharging and charging processes. The catalytic effects for each step in SRR and SER are highlighted and the homogenous catalysts, the selective catalysts, and the bidirectional catalysts are discussed, which can help guide the rational design of the catalysts and practical applications of lithium-sulfur batteries.",Chemical Record
Progress of carbon and Metal-Based Three-Dimensional materials for Dendrite-Proof and Interface-Compatible lithium metal anode,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Accompanied with ever-increasing demand of high energy storage devices, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have received wide interest due to the extraordinarily high theoretical energy density and specific capacity. However, the issue of Li dendrite growth, caused by uneven Li deposition, side reactions of the electrode process, and unstable electrode/electrolyte interface, has severely handicapped the application and development of Li metal anodes. Rational design of the electrode–electrolyte interface is of great importance for dendrite-proof and interface-compatible LMBs. In this regard, three-dimensional (3D) materials have been concentrated owing to the excellent structural stability, high specific surface area, high porosity and easy-to-control hierarchical structure. This review focuses on the research progress of 3D materials in response to solving the interface problems of Li metal anodes, including metal-based and carbon-based 3D current collectors, and the application of organic and inorganic 3D materials to interface modification. We also analyze the function and mechanism of 3D material-controlled interface as well as the underlying principle of interface design. Challenges and development pathways of 3D materials are finally proposed to boost the further application of LMBs.",Applied Surface Science
Tailoring nanostructured materials based on γ-graphyne monolayers modified with Au heteroatoms for application in energy storage devices: A first principle study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Pristine γ-graphyne (γ-GY) is a widely known two-dimensional system that has a high Li, Na, and K adsorption capacity with high energy barriers for the diffusion of such metal ions. In this work, we used dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations to investigate the electronic effect of Au-doped γ-graphyne (GYE-Au and GY-Au) monolayers on the adsorption and diffusion of M metal-ions (M = Li, Na, and K). The nature of the electronic structure of the GYE-Au monolayers corresponds to a semi-metallic behavior. According to climbing image nudge elastic band calculations, low activation energies in the diffusion of M atoms are associated with the presence of the Au atom with respect to the γ-GY monolayer. High adsorption energy values were associated with the storage capacity of the GYE-Au monolayers. The electronic storage properties such as open circuit voltage and theoretical specific capacity were improved in the GYE-Au monolayers. This study shows that, at an atomistic level, the GYE-Au monolayers could be an excellent 2D anode material for Li, Na, and K-ion batteries.",Applied Surface Science
Exploring Interfaces Through Synchrotron Radiation Characterization Techniques: A Graphene Case,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Recently, many breakthroughs have been made in graphene research, allowing scientists to explore and understand the material world from a two-dimensional (2D) perspective. The interface issue of graphene is the most important, because all of its atoms are exposed to the interface for this atomically thin material. The 2D nature necessitates a sensitive and non-destructive interface probe to detect the structure and properties. Synchrotron radiation (SR) characterization techniques, with the ultra-high resolution and extremely wide energy range, have been utilized with increasing frequency to explore the challenging interface sciences. In this review, these interface characterization techniques based on SR and how they monitor the structure evolution of graphene in different interfaces such as graphene–substrate and graphene–graphene interface are first introduced. Graphene's layer number, interlayer spacing, and stacking order are governed by these interfaces, determining the final properties. Then, the property detection and modulation in different interfaces of graphene are also discussed. Finally, the current challenges and outlook on the future development for SR techniques to characterize graphene interface are presented.",Advanced Functional Materials
Using sp2 N atom anchoring effect to prepare ultrafine vanadium nitride particles on porous nitrogen-doped carbon as cathode for lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022Porous carbon-supported transition metals and their compounds have attracted much attention as sulfur host materials for cathodes of lithium-sulfur batteries, due to their high chemisorption capacity and ability to catalyze the conversion of polysulfides. However, actual activity of these materials is not very high because of low specific surface areas of transition metal compounds synthesized at high temperatures. In this study, ultra-fine vanadium nitride particles with an average particle size of ca. 4 nm (VN/M/NC) are successfully grown on the surface of nitrogen-doped three-dimensional carbon using sp2 nitrogen atoms, resulting from melamine pyrolysis in the presence of ammonium metavanadate, as anchor points to lock vanadium atoms in the VN/M/NC material. When used as a cathode for lithium-sulfur battery, VN/M/NC demonstrates initial discharge specific capacity of 1080 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, and retains a discharge capacity of 475 mAh g−1 at a high rate of 2 C. With capacity attenuation of only 0.037% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1 C, the newly obtained VN/M/NC can be a promising cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Track-etched polyimide separator decorated with polyvinylpyrrolidone for self-assembling a robust protective layer on lithium-metal anode,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The practical application of Li metal is hampered by critical obstacles, such as the indiscriminate dendritic growth of metallic Li and severe dimensional changes during cycling. Effective surface engineering is necessary to stabilize the interfacial reactions of Li metal to resolve these technical issues. Many strategies have been proposed to mitigate this inherent limitation of Li metal. The interfacial stabilization using an electrolyte additive or polymer coating is the most common approach to enable the uniform distribution of Li+ on the surface of Li metal. In parallel, the development of functional separators is also considered a promising alternative strategy for effective suppression of the fatal growth of Li dendrites because it promotes Li+ transfer at the interfaces. The synergistic effect of regulating Li+ flux and promoting Li+ transfer is expected to effectively prohibit the dendritic growth of metallic Li. Herein, we report a track-etched polyimide (TEPI) separator with vertically aligned nanochannels decorated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) that enables a self-assembled robust protective layer on the surface. From a structural viewpoint, the vertically aligned nanochannels of the TEPI separator allow for fast Li+ migration. Additionally, hydrophilic PVP can regulate Li+ flux uniformly through the nanochannels by forming a stable Li3N-dominant solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, thereby enhancing interfacial kinetics and suppressing the Li dendrite growth during cycling. We demonstrate that the TEPI separator decorated with PVP is effective in securing high reversibility and the improved cycle performance of Li-metal batteries (LMBs).",Chemical Engineering Journal
Selective degradation of parachlorophenol using Fe/Fe3O4@CPPy nanocomposites via the dual nonradical/radical peroxymonosulfate activation mechanisms,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal-carbon composite materials have been regarded as emerging catalysts for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by combining the advantages of both parties. Nevertheless, these novel catalysts usually face the side effect of the complex water matrix, and the PMS activation mechanism need to be further clarified. Herein, we rational synthesized the Fe/Fe3O4@CPPy nanocomposites, and the catalytic performance of PMS activation was evaluated by parachlorophenol (4-CP) degradation. The elevated catalytic activity was observed in the optimal Fe/Fe3O4@CPPy-4/PMS system over a wide temperature (10–45 °C) and pH range (3–9), in which the 4-CP removal rate could achieve up to 98.64% within 10 min, as well as the low leakage of iron (49.0 μg/L). Notably, the normal concentrations of coexisting irons and humic acid in surface water matrix could hardly affect the 4-CP removal efficiency, demonstrating the superior selective oxidation capacity of Fe/Fe3O4@CPPy nanocomposites. A positive correlation was displayed between k values and the content of electron-rich carbonyl group (C[dbnd]O), and the pyridinic N, graphitic N and Fe species also participated in the 4-CP removal, which synergistically resulted in the outstanding performance. Moreover, the O2[rad]−, 1O2 and direct electron transfer pathways played a primary role in 4-CP elimination, whereas the SO4[rad]−/[rad]OH displayed the secondary contribution. Therefore, a dual non-radical/radical PMS activation mechanism was unveiled in the Fe/Fe3O4@CPPy-4/PMS system. This work not only provides a high-activity and well-adjusted PMS catalyst for complicated water matrix, but also elucidates PMS activation mechanism in the metal–carbon composite materials.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Controlling the D-band for improved oxygen evolution performance in Ni modulated ultrafine Co nanoparticles embedded in Nitrogen-doped carbon microspheres,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Despite the challenges on tuning the d-band structure of transition metals, the d-band is of great importance for promoting the interaction between catalytic and intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. Herein, ultrafine Co nanoparticles embedded in the surface layer of nitrogen-doped carbon microspheres are prepared through an in-situ co-coordination strategy, and its d-band is modulated by introducing different Ni amounts. The introduction of Ni in the Co crystal lattice can tune the d-band center and unpaired electrons, which collectively result in an enhancement of OER activity and kinetics. By investigating the catalysts with Ni content from 0% to 75%, it is concluded that the catalyst with 25% Ni shows optimal OER activity, lower overpotential (285 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and higher current densities (73.75 mA cm−2 at 1.63 V). Moreover, the good stability is also demonstrated with the negligible decrease on current densities after 3000 CV cycles or 100 h of continuous test in alkaline media. This concept of modulating the d-band structure by introducing a transition metal with different contents in another transition metal crystal lattice could present an alternative pathway to the development of highly active catalytic materials for OER and beyond.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Self-assembled sulphur doped carbon nitride for photocatalytic water reforming of methanol,"© 2022 The AuthorsThe ability to effectively harness and store renewable solar energy in chemical forms, e.g., methanol has been widely recognised as a promising and sustainable strategy for H2 storage. Though traditional steam reforming of methanol enables effective H2 release from methanol and water, the harsh operating conditions result in high energy consumption and CO by-product. To minimize CO emission and maximise H2 production, photocatalytic liquid water reforming of methanol has been developed to produce H2 by sulphur doped graphitic carbon nitride (SCN) in this work. Consequently, both H2 and carbon dioxide (CO2) can be evolved in an ideal ratio of 3:1 and H2 yield has been found to be dependent on pH and the reaction temperature. A stable and reproducible H2 evolution rate of 14.7 mmol g-1h−1 from water/methanol over 95 h without CO evolution has been achieved, with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of c.a. 30 % at 365 nm. The sulphur was found to exist as N-S-H and C-S-H bonds in the SCN photocatalysts, while the latter was found to be well correlated to the photocatalytic activity of H2 production. Such sulfur doping narrows the bandgap and offers enhanced charge separation, thus leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity.",Chemical Engineering Journal

In situ localization of BiVO4 onto two-dimensional MXene promoting photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction to ammonia,"© 2022The existing industrial ammonia synthesis usually adopts the Haber-Bosch process, which requires harsh conditions of high temperature and high pressure, and consumes high energy. Under this circumstance, photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysis is regarded as a promising method for N2 reduction reaction (NRR), but bears problems of low efficiency and yield. Thus, exploring active catalysts remains highly desirable. In this work, BiVO4@MXene hybrids have been facilely synthesized by a hydrothermal route. The heterojunctions by the in situ growth of BiVO4 onto two-dimensional (2D) MXene greatly increase the NRR efficiency: under photoelectric conditions, the optimized NH3 yield is 27.25 µg h − 1 cm−2, and the Faraday efficiency achieves 17.54% at −0.8 V relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which are higher than most state-of-the-art NRR (photo) electrocatalysts. The mechanism speculation shows the enhanced light absorption range and the heterojunction formation largely promote the separation and the transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers, thereby improving the PEC catalytic ability. Therefore, this work provides a hybrid route to combine the advantages of photo and electric catalysis for effective artificial nitrogen fixation.",Chinese Chemical Letters

Simultaneously suppressing the dendritic lithium growth and polysulfides migration by a polyethyleneimine grafted bacterial cellulose membrane in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Author(s)Owing to the ultrahigh theoretical energy density and low-cost, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries hold broad prospects as one of the promising substitutes for commercial lithium-ion batteries. The polysulfides shuttling originated from sulfur cathode and the lithium dendrite growth from lithium anode are the main challenges that hinder the commercial survival of Li-S batteries. Herein, thermal stable bacterial cellulose (BC) separator is successfully fixed with polyethyleneimine (PEI) by a scalable chemical grafting. The hydroxyl groups and amino groups in PEI grafted BC (PEI@BC) separator can participate in the formation of Li2O and Li3N, respectively, contributing to robust solid electrolyte interface with high ionic conductivity. Therefore, the lithium deposition is well regulated, resulting in a spherical and dendrite-free Li deposit pattern. The Li/Li symmetrical cell assembled with PEI@BC separator exhibits excellent cyclic stability, which can continuously plate/stripe for more than 820 h with an overpotential of ∼ 40 mV at 2 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, the polar amino group can restrain the polysulfides migration via chemosorption. As a consequence of these merits, ultrahigh initial capacity (1402 mAh g−1 at 0.1C) and excellent rate performance (440.5 mAh g−1 at 2C) for Li-S full cell are achieved, presenting new insights into the fabrication of multifunctional separators for Li-S batteries.",Applied Surface Science
Hemin loaded Zn−N–C single-atom nanozymes for assay of propyl gallate and formaldehyde in food samples,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSingle-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) show distinct advantages in catalytic activity and selectivity owing to their stability and special characteristic of maximum atomic utilization. Inspired by the structure of natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP), we developed a simple method for specific determination of both propyl gallate (PG) and formaldehyde (HCHO) by utilizing the intrinsic peroxidase mimics activity of hemin (hem) loaded Zn–nitrogen–carbon single-atom nanozymes (Zn–N–C@hem SAzymes). Zn–N–C@hem was prepared via a salt-template strategy and self-assembly, where hemin exhibits enhancing peroxidase-like activity can catalyze oxidation of colorless PG to yellow product. Upon introduction of HCHO into Zn–N–C@hem/PG system, complete suppression of PG oxidation was showed, resulting in distinguished decrease in absorbance. The colorimetric sensors of PG and HCHO based on Zn–N–C@hem/PG were developed at their respective linear range of concentration 1.25–200 mg/kg and 5–250 mg/kg. The practicability of the rapid analysis of PG and HCHO in food samples has been verified with reliable results.",Food Chemistry
Three-Dimensional Fe Single-Atom Catalyst for High-Performance Cathode of Zn-Air Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Designing cost-effective and highly active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is critical for the development of Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Iron-nitrogen-carbon (Fe-N-C) catalysts with single-atom Fe-Nx active sites are considered as one of the most promising alternatives to noble Pt but are hindered by unsatisfactory activity and durability. Herein, a NaCl template-assisted in situ pyrolysis technique is utilized to massively fabricate Fe-N-C single-atom catalysts (SACs) anchored on the three-dimensional open-pore carbon networks (denoted as 3D SAFe). The 3D SAFe catalyst exhibits ultrahigh activity with a half-wave potential of 0.90 V (vs RHE), benefiting from the enhanced mass diffusion and the increased amount of effective Fe-N4 sites. Consequently, the ZABs assembled with 3D SAFe deliver high peak power density up to 156 mW cm-2 and outstanding durability of 80 h, suggesting the application potential of the 3D SAFe catalyst. This work inspires the rational design and synthesis of highly efficient SACs for ZABs.",Nano Letters
"Crystallographically Textured Electrodes for Rechargeable Batteries: Symmetry, Fabrication, and Characterization","© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The vast of majority of battery electrode materials of contemporary interest are of a crystalline nature. Crystals are, by definition, anisotropic from an atomic-structure perspective. The inherent structural anisotropy may give rise to favored mesoscale orientations and anisotropic properties whether the material is in a rest state or subjected to an external stimulus. The overall perspective of this review is that intentional manipulation of crystallographic anisotropy of electrochemically active materials constitute an untapped parameter space in energy storage systems and thus provide new opportunities for materials innovations and design. To that end, we contend that crystallographically textured electrodes, as opposed to their textureless poly crystalline or single-crystalline analogs, are promising candidates for next-generation storage of electrical energy in rechargeable batteries relevant to commercial practice. This perspective is underpinned first by the fundamental─to a first approximation─uniaxial, rotation-invariant symmetry of electrochemical cells. On this basis, we show that a crystallographically textured electrode with the preferred orientation aligned out-of-plane toward the counter electrode represents an optimal strategy for utilization of the crystals' anisotropic properties. Detailed analyses of anisotropy of different types lead to a simple, but potentially useful general principle that ""Pec//Pc"" textures are optimal for metal anodes, and ""Pec//Sc"" textures are optimal for insertion-type electrodes.",Chemical Reviews
High-performance ORR Catalyst of N-doping Carbon-coated Cobalt Nanoparticles Synthesized by DC Arc Plasma,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.It is necessary to develop the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts with aid to promote sluggish electrochemical kinetics in some energy conversion systems, e. g. fuel cells or metal-air cells. Cobalt-nitrogen-carbon catalysts get a lot of attention owing to their excellent ORR performance, durability and lower cost. In this study, the physical vapor condensation route of DC arc plasma was developed to prepare the carbon-coated cobalt nanoparticles (Co@C NPs) as a prime precursor, which was then suffered from a N-doping process to harvest the Co@C(N) NPs catalyst materials. The synthesized Co@C(N) NPs exhibit excellent ORR catalytic performances with overt merits, such as lower cost, easy preparation, high-yield, with respect to the precious metal catalysts. It is indicated that the Co@C(N) catalysts show a higher onset potential (E onset) of 0.99 V (vs. RHE), the limiting current density (J m) of 4.99 mA cm−2, and the excellent durability with only 10 mV of negative shift generated in the half wave potential (E1/2) after 5000 cycles. Synergistic effect between the Co core of Co@C(N) nanoparticles and the active N-containing sites in carbon layers is responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance, meanwhile the unique core-shell nanostructure can also effectively protect the catalyst from deterioration in work. The N-doping carbon-coated Co@C(N) nanoparticles synthesized by DC arc plasma technique becomes a new strategy for development of non-noble metal electrocatalysts.",ChemistrySelect
"A Review on MXene Synthesis, Stability, and Photocatalytic Applications","© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Photocatalytic water splitting, CO2reduction, and pollutant degradation have emerged as promising strategies to remedy the existing environmental and energy crises. However, grafting of expensive and less abundant noble-metal cocatalysts on photocatalyst materials is a mandatory practice to achieve enhanced photocatalytic performance owing to the ability of the cocatalysts to extract electrons efficiently from the photocatalyst and enable rapid/enhanced catalytic reaction. Hence, developing highly efficient, inexpensive, and noble-metal-free cocatalysts composed of earth-abundant elements is considered as a noteworthy step toward considering photocatalysis as a more economical strategy. Recently, MXenes (two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides) have shown huge potential as alternatives for noble-metal cocatalysts. MXenes have several excellent properties, including atomically thin 2D morphology, metallic electrical conductivity, hydrophilic surface, and high specific surface area. In addition, they exhibit Gibbs free energy of intermediate H atom adsorption as close to zero and less than that of a commercial Pt-based cocatalyst, a Fermi level position above the H2generation potential, and an excellent ability to capture and activate CO2molecules. Therefore, there is a growing interest in MXene-based photocatalyst materials for various photocatalytic events. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in the synthesis of MXenes with 2D and 0D morphologies, the stability of MXenes, and MXene-based photocatalysts for H2evolution, CO2reduction, and pollutant degradation. The existing challenges and the possible future directions to enhance the photocatalytic performance of MXene-based photocatalysts are also discussed.",ACS Nano

"""dual Mediator System"" Enables Efficient and Persistent Regulation toward Sulfur Redox Conversion in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries","© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Li-S batteries present great potential to realize high-energy-density storage, but their practical implementation is severely hampered by the notorious polysulfide shuttling and the sluggish redox kinetics. While rationally designed redox mediators can optimize polysulfide conversion, the efficiency and stability of such a mediation process still remain formidable challenges. Herein, a strategy of constructing a ""dual mediator system"" is proposed for achieving efficient and durable modulation of polysulfide conversion kinetics by coupling well-selected solid and electrolyte-soluble mediators. Theoretical prediction and detailed electrochemical analysis reveal the structure-activity relationships of the two mediators in synergistically optimizing the redox conversions of sulfur species, thus achieving a deeper mechanistic understanding of a function-supporting mediator system design toward sulfur electrochemistry promotion. Specifically, such a dual mediator system realizes the bridging of full-range ""electrochemical catalysis"" and strengthened ""chemical reduction"" processes of sulfur species as well as greatly suppressed mediator deactivation/loss due to the beneficial interactions between each mediator component. Attributed to these advantageous features, the Li-S batteries enable a slow capacity decay of 0.026% per cycle over 1200 cycles and a desirable capacity of 8.8 mAh cm-2with 8.2 mg cm-2sulfur loading and lean electrolyte condition.

Synergistic Adsorption-Electrocatalysis of Mo-MoB Heterostructures for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Because of the high theoretical capacity of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries and the relatively low cost of sulfur, these batteries have been regarded as one of the most promising types of energy storage systems. The severe shuttle effect of the polysulfide deteriorates the cycle stability, and the inferior conductivity of the sulfur and polysulfide also lead to sluggish electrochemical kinetics. Herein, we use a facile molten salt method to synthesize the heterostructure Mo-MoB, which is coated on a commercial PP separator for the Li-S batteries. Experimental analysis and theoretical calculation results show that the heterostructure Mo-MoB can serve as a physical barrier and chemical absorbent to hinder the shuttle effect, as well as be a bidirectional catalyst to simultaneously accelerate the conversion of polysulfides into Li2S and decomposition of Li2S with the synergistically catalytic effect of Mo and MoB. Consequently, the cell with the heterostructure Mo-MoB-modified separator demonstrates superior cycle performance (capacity fading rate of ∼0.07% per cycle during 300 cycles at 0.5 C) as well as increased rate capability (670 mAh g-1 at 2 C). This work indicates that heterostructure metal borides could be adsorption-catalysis material to functionalize the separator, which can be a new strategy to design the high-performance Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials

Efficient Control of the Shuttle Effect in Sodium-Sulfur Batteries with Functionalized Nanoporous Graphenes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries (RT-NaSBs) are the evolving candidates for large-scale stationary storage because of their major benefits including double-electron redox process and the natural abundance of sodium and sulfur resources. However, their practical applications have been hampered by the poor cycling stability due to the shuttle effect. This work aims at understanding the role of heteroatom-functionalized nanoporous graphene (NPG) in preventing the shuttle effect. The density functional theory method was used to unravel important properties associated with polysulfide-NPG interactions, including binding energy, electronic density of states, charge transfer mechanism, and dissociative energy barriers of the polysulfides. The findings reveal that oxygen- and nitrogen-functionalized NPG can effectively present the shuttle effect by chemically binding to sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn) with a binding energy stronger than that between Na2Snand the common electrolyte solvents. The chemical adsorption of Na2Snon the functionalized NPG causes a semiconductor-to-metal transition, benefiting the electrical conductivity. Moreover, the functionalized NPG lowers the Na2S dissociation energy to substantially form NaS and Na, which serves as a catalyst for enhancing the redox reactions between Na and S.",ACS Applied Nano Materials

High performance graphene oxide/NiAl2O4 directly grown on carbon cloth hybrid for oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCDue to the lethargic kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires a high anodic voltage, restricting the efficiency as well as practical applications for electrochemical water splitting. For this purpose, metal oxides (M − O) are viewed as a potential competitor in this search because of their high redox potential. Still, their low conductivity and instability are two significant barriers that must be addressed. In this study the nanocomposite of NiAl2O4 with graphene oxide (GO) as a highly effective and long-lasting electrocatalyst for OER has been fabricated. In an alkaline (1.0 M KOH) medium, the GO/NiAl2O4 responds to a very sharp overpotential of 219 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and with a lower value of tafel slope (43 mV/dec) as compared to its counterparts. The GO/NiAl2O4 corresponds to the high stability of 18 h with retained crystal structure and morphology. For the expected prolonged OER process, we assume the active redox couple due to the presence of Ni+2/+3 metal in NiAl2O4 varies periodically. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of NiAl2O4, combined with the GO, facilitates the dynamics of O2 evolution as a final product, and are useful for further applications in future era.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy

Among the several solar energy conversion techniques, photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) generation is regarded as one of the most promising routes. Till date, several metal-based semiconductor materials have been investigated, however, H2 generation is not substantial with the notion of sustainable development. Current research trends show the growing interest in advanced and metal free photocatalyst materials such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) due to their several benefits such as crystalline porous polymers with pre-designed architectures, large surface area, exceptional stability, and ease of molecular functionalization. By combining COFs with other functional materials, composites may be created that display unique characteristics that exceed those of the separate components.

Two-Dimensional Imide-Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tailored Pore Functionality as Separators for High-Performance Li-S Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Modifying the separator of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) is considered to be one of the most effective strategies for relieving the notorious polysulfide shuttle effect. Constructing a stable, lightweight, and effective LSB separator is still a big challenge but highly desirable. Herein, a stable and lightweight imide-based covalent organic framework (COF-TpPa) is facilely fabricated on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through an oxygen-free solvothermal technique. With the directing effect of rGO and changing the side functional group of the monomer, the morphology and the pore tailoring of COF-TpPa can be simultaneously achieved and two-dimensional (2D) COF nanosheets with different functionalities (such as -SO3H and -Cl) are successfully constructed on rGO films. The specific functional groups inside the COF's pore channels and the narrowed pore size result in efficient absorption and restriction of Li2Sn for weakening the ""shuttle effect"". Meanwhile, the 2D COF nanosheets on the rGO is a favorable morphology for better exploiting pores inside the COF materials. As a result, the COF-SO3H-modified separator, consisting of rGO and COF-TpPa-SO3H, exhibits a high specific capacity (1163.4 mA h/g at 0.2 C) and a desirable cyclic performance (60.2% retention rate after 1000 cycles at 2.0 C) for LSBs. Our study provides a feasible strategy to rationally design functional COFs and boosts their applications in various energy storage systems.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
"Sacrificial Template Method to Synthesize Atomically Dispersed Mn Atoms on S, N-Codoped Carbon as a Separator Modifier for Advanced Li-S Batteries","© 2022 American Chemical Society.Efficient and durable electrocatalysts are important for polysulfide conversion in high-performance Li-S batteries. Herein, we report a sacrificial template strategy to synthesize a sulfur/nitrogen-codoped carbon-supported manganese (Mn) single-atom catalyst (Mn/SNC). The synthesis is enabled by fabricating a novel precursor, i.e., cadmium sulfide (CdS) wrapped with Mn ion-impregnated polyporrole (CdS@Mn-PPy), and subsequent pyrolysis. During pyrolysis, the CdS template is decomposed into Cd and S, PPy-derived carbon is doped with N and S, and Mn ions are reduced to Mn atoms, forming Mn-N active sites. The evaporation of Cd atoms/clusters creates abundant pores in the carbon substrate to expose the active sites and facilitate ion transport, and S atoms can form edge C-S-C bonds to improve the activity of Mn-N sites. Benefiting from the above advantages, the Mn/SNC catalyst markedly enhances the performance of Li-S batteries, delivering an initial capacity of 1563.7 mAh g-1 at 0.1C, a capacity decay of only 0.037% per cycle after 1600 cycles at 2C; a capacity of 1045.1 mAh g-1 at a high sulfur loading of 7.44 mg cm-2 at 0.2C, and a capacity retention of 73.1% after 180 cycles. This work provides a strategy that may benefit further the rational design and development of single-atom catalysts for application in renewable energy.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Conjugated Three-Dimensional High-Connected Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Developing conjugated three-dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) still remains an extremely difficult task due to the lack of enough conjugated 3D building blocks. Herein, condensation between an 8-connected pentiptycene-based D2h building block (DMOPTP) and 4-connected square-planar linkers affords two 3D COFs (named 3D-scu-COF-1 and 3D-scu-COF-2). A combination of the 3D homoaromatic conjugated structure of the former building block with the 2D conjugated structure of the latter linking units enables the π-electron delocalization over the whole frameworks of both COFs, endowing them with excellent conductivities of 3.2-3.5 × 10-5 S cm-1. In particular, the 3D rigid quadrangular prism shape of DMOPTP guides the formation of a twofold interpenetrated scu 3D topology and high-connected permanent porosity with a large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 2340 and 1602 m2 g-1 for 3D-scu-COF-1 and 3D-scu-COF-2, respectively, ensuring effective small molecule storage and mass transport characteristics. This, in combination with their good charge transport properties, renders them promising sulfur host materials for lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) with high capacities (1035-1155 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C, 1 C = 1675 mA g-1), excellent rate capabilities (713-757 mA h g-1 at 5.0 C), and superior cycling stability (71-83% capacity retention at 2.0 C after 500 cycles), surpassing the most of organic LSB cathodes reported thus far.",Journal of the American Chemical Society
A Cu(ii) complex supported on Fe3O4@SiO2 as a magnetic heterogeneous catalyst for the reduction of environmental pollutants,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Today, the presence of pollutants in the environment has become one of the serious problems and concerns of human beings. To eliminate these pollutants, researchers have made many efforts. One of the most important of these efforts is the reduction of such contaminants in the presence of effective catalysts. Two of the most important and widespread types of these pollutants are nitro compounds and organic dyes. In this paper, we report the synthesis of an efficient and reusable magnetic catalyst using Fe3O4@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles (NPs), N-(4-bromophenyl)-N′-benzoylthiourea, and copper(ii). Specifically, the Cu(ii)-N-(4-bromophenyl)-N′-benzoylthiourea complex supported on Fe3O4-core magnetic NPs (CM)/SiO2-shell (SS) (CM@SS-BBTU-Cu(ii)) has been prepared. CM@SS-BBTU-Cu(ii) was characterized by FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), XRD (X-ray diffraction), TEM (transmission electron microscopy), HRTEM (high resolution transmission electron microscopy), FFT (fast Fourier transform), VSM (vibrating sample magnetometry), TG-DTA (thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis), STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy), EDS (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy), and elemental mapping. The synthesized CM@SS-BBTU-Cu(ii) was applied for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), Congo red (CR), and methylene blue (MB) in the presence of NaBH4 (sodium borohydride) at room temperature. CM@SS-BBTU-Cu(ii) can be recycled and reused 5 times. Our results displayed that the performance of the catalyst was not significantly reduced by recycling.",RSC Advances
"Nitrogen Electroreduction on Borophene-Supported Atomic and Diatomic Transition Metals: Stability, Activity and Selectivity Improvements via Defect-Engineering","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The present work investigated the binding of atomically dispersed transition metals to the perfect and single/double vacancy (SV/DV)-containing defective β12-borophenes and the catalytic performance of those corresponding single-atom catalysts (SACs) and diatomic catalysts (DACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) by means of density functional theory calculations. Although previous theoretical studies proposed that the inherent hexagon hole of the defect-free β12-borophene is capable of anchoring single metal atom for NRR, calculations suggested that the interaction between borophene and doped metal is not strong enough to avoid metal aggregation. For the defective β12-borophene with SV, even though the single metal could be stabilized in an 8-membered ring, it was found that the SAC was still ineffective for NRR because of the competitive hydrogen evolution process. Regarding the DV-containing β12-borophene, a defective configuration with an unexpected 11-membered hole was proved as the most stable structure, which possessed a very similar average atomic energy (6.25 eV atom−1) compared to that of the pristine β12 sheet (6.26 eV atom−1). Two metal atoms could be encapsulated into the confined space of the B11 ring. Compared to SACs, those corresponding DACs were more active for N2 fixation and hydrogenation, and the hydrogen evolution reaction could be passivated, attributing to the synergistic effect of dual metal centres. Among all candidates, the V2/β12-DV was predicted as the most promising catalyst for NRR, with the limiting potential of as low as −0.15 V.",ChemSusChem
Oxygen vacancy-engineered Fe2O3 porous microspheres with large specific surface area for hydrogen evolution reaction and lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Iron oxide (Fe2O3) with intrinsic catalytic activity and desirable theoretical capacity are expected to be promising active materials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Nevertheless, the sluggish electrons transfer accompanied with limited active sites impede their large-scale application. Generally, the silicon dioxide (SiO2) is employed as sacrificial template to regulate morphological structure of target products. However, selecting SiO2 as sacrificial shell may be a novel method to overcome the limitations and further optimize the performance of Fe2O3. Hence, a novel self-activation strategy along with reduction treatment is presented to prepare oxygen vacancy-engineered Fe2O3 porous microspheres featured with high specific surface area (SA-Fe2O3 (Ov)). Specifically, the simultaneously formation of rich oxygen vacancies and porous configuration could regulate electronic configuration, expose numerous active sites and enhance electrons transfer, leading to superior achievement for HER and Li-S batteries. Remarkably, the elaborately designed SA-Fe2O3 (Ov) achieves low overpotential and relatively small Tafel slopes. Furthermore, SA-Fe2O3 (Ov) holds great promise serving as sulfur host in the field of Li-S batteries with reversible capacity and impressive durability. This work contributes new insights into the self-activation strategy coupled with reduction synthesis of oxygen vacancy-engineered porous oxides with large specific surface area and raises the understanding of multifunctional energy applications.",Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects
One dimensional carbon-based composites as cathodes for lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs), owing to their much higher energy density compared to the traditional lithium-ion battery, are deemed as one of the most promising candidates for the energy storage system. However, several issues including shuttle effect, lithium dendrites, and volumetric expansion seriously impede the commercial applications of LSBs. One-dimensional carbon materials (1DCMs) have been widely used as the matrix material for LSBs due to their high surface area, superior conductivity, good flexibility, excellent mechanical stability, and functional modifiability. In this review, the recent progress in 1D carbon-based composites as cathode including metal compounds/1DCMs, MOFs/1DCMs, MXenes/1DCMs, and polymers/1DCMs were discussed. Different strategies for polysulfide confinement and analysis of the functions of various components in the composites were summarized detailly. In the end, the current challenges of LSBs were systematically summarized, and the future outlooks were proposed, aiming at providing a comprehensive insight into the design of new host materials for next-generation LSBs.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
The Structural Phase Effect of MoS2 in Controlling the Reaction Selectivity between Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation and Dimerization of Furfural,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The development of a multifunctional electrocatalyst for upgrading biomass-derived platform molecules can diversify the product outcomes of a biorefinery and strengthen its role in the current petroleum-dominated economy. This study demonstrated how the structural phase distribution of a transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) catalyst, MoS2, can be exploited to control the reaction pathway between electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) and electrocatalytic dimerization (ECD) of furfural (FFL). A series of carbon-supported MoS2 electrodes with different structural phase distributions, 1T and 2H, were prepared and fully characterized. The electrodes displayed good stability and successfully converted over 98% of FFL to target products. Under optimized conditions, the 1T-rich MoS2 electrodes were highly selective in producing an ECH product, furfuryl alcohol, with a selectivity of 94.4% over the ECD product, hydrofuroin, whereas the 2H-rich MoS2 electrodes achieved up to 42.7% selectivity for an ECD product. Mechanistic investigation with underpotential hydrogen desorption (HUPD) studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that 1T and 2H-MoS2 played very different roles during the electrolysis of FFL. The HER-active 1T phase was less friendly to FFL's adsorption than the 2H phase, but its ability to generate adsorbed hydrogen (Hads) provided the necessary component to complete the ECH process. The 2H phase was a better platform for FFL and its radical intermediate adsorption, but its Hads-deficient surface led to more ECD product. This study expands the opportunity to design multiphasic materials to control product selectivity during the electrocatalytic reduction of aldehyde compounds.",ACS Catalysis
Surface-Regulated Platinum-Copper Nanoframes in Electrochemical Reforming of Ethanol for Efficient Hydrogen Production,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Replacing the kinetics sluggish oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically favorable ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is a prospective method to boost energy-efficient hydrogen production. Surface regulation has achieved great success in enhancing catalytic performance, but it has been rarely demonstrated for the coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/EOR to date. Herein, the three-dimensional PtCu nanoframe (NF) with high-index facets and multi-channels is designed through a dealloying strategy to achieve bifunctional catalysis for HER and EOR. The PtCu NF/C needs only 0.58 V to arrive at 10 mA cm-2 in the coupled HER/EOR, while 1.88 V is required in water splitting. Moreover, ethanol can be oxidized by PtCu NF/C to acetate with a high Faradaic efficiency of 92%. Mechanistic studies reveal that the combination of the three-dimensional structure, Cu introduction, and high-index facets endows the PtCu NF/C with enhanced adsorption capacity for ethanol and H2O, as well as dissociation capacity for C-H bonds of ethanol. This work is the icing on the cake for bifunctional electrocatalysts and the further development of energy-saving hydrogen evolution.",ACS Catalysis
Ion slippage through Li+-centered G-quadruplex,"© 2022 The Authors, some rights reserved.Single-ion conductors have garnered attention in energy storage systems as a promising alternative to currently widespread electrolytes that allow migration of cations and anions. However, ion transport phenomena of most single-ion conductors are affected by strong ion (e.g., Li+)–ion (immobilized anionic domains) interactions and tortuous paths, which pose an obstacle to achieving performance breakthroughs. Here, we present a Li+-centered G-quadruplex (LiGQ) as a class of single-ion conductor based on directional Li+ slippage at the microscopic level. A guanine derivative with liquid crystalline moieties is self-assembled to form a hexagonal ordered columnar structure in the LiGQ, thereby yielding one-dimensional central channels that provide weak ion-dipole interaction and straightforward ionic pathways. The LiGQ exhibits weak Li+ binding energy and low activation energy for ion conduction, verifying its viability as a new electrolyte design.",Science Advances
Polydopamine-Derived Iron-Doped Hollow Carbon Nanorods as an Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Simultaneous Generation of Hydrogen and Electricity,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.As a step toward developing robust and highly active electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), we have developed a polydopamine-derived iron-doped hollow carbon nanorod (FeHCNR). It exhibits high electrocatalytic activity toward the HER in acidic media with an overpotential of 29.4 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm-2. The catalyst also displays efficient activity for the ORR in acidic media with a high onset potential of 0.97 V. To demonstrate the practical feasibility of the HER characteristics, we designed a new type of Zn-H2 hybrid battery for the simultaneous generation of hydrogen and electricity by asymmetric electrolysis with the acid catholyte and alkaline anolyte. The system displayed an open-circuit voltage of 1.28 V along with good stability compared to that of the one built using the commercial Pt/C catalyst. This device could generate H2 gas with a Faradaic efficiency of 97% along with the generation of electricity. Moreover, the outstanding ORR activity of the FeHCNR could be validated by demonstrating an asymmetric-electrolyte Zn-air battery by employing the catalyst as the cathode, which provided an open-circuit voltage of 2.15 V and a power density of 69 mW cm-2 with the contribution of the electrochemical neutralization energy along with Zn oxidation. Thus, the FeHCNR could perform well toward the HER and ORR during the system-level demonstrations, and this advantage is mainly credited to the hollow nanorod structure of the catalyst, which provides better exposure of the active sites along the outer and inner walls of the system to facilitate the concerned reactions. The open-tube cavity structure of the FeHCNR is supportive for the simultaneous diffusion of the electrolyte and reactants along with more facile dissipation of the products.",Energy and Fuels

Herein, electrochemical performance of Se/carbon cathode for Li-Se battery in three kinds of electrolytes, e.g., ether-based, ester-based and solvate electrolyte, were studied to discuss the possibility of capacity as well as cycle life regulation. The Se/carbon cathode showed significant overcharging in the ether-based electrolyte owing to a severe polyselenide shuttle problem, and displayed a moderate electrochemical performance in ester-based electrolyte. Due to the no free solvent property of the solvate electrolyte, the Se/carbon cathode obtained extremely high Se utilization with an initial specific capacity of 621 mA h g−1 and a reversible capacity of 516 mA h g−1 at 1.0C current rate after 200cycles.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
Effect of in-situ derived sulfur dispersion on dual carbon lithium-ion capacitors,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) bridge the performance gap between the energy-dense lithium-ion batteries and power-dense ultracapacitors. This work elucidates the study of a lithium-ion capacitor with two types of carbonaceous compounds as electrode materials from a single keratin biowaste source. The cysteinic disulfide linkages in keratin results in the derivation of the battery-type sulfur-disperse carbon electrode which shows a blend of Li-ion storage mechanisms resulting from the lithium-sulfur redox activity and lithium-insertion into the carbon host. Whereas, the adsorption characteristics of the heteroporous capacitive carbon make it an ideal candidate for the capacitor-type electrode. The lithium-ion capacitor full cell using prelithiation of sulfur-disperse carbon as the battery-type and heteroporous carbon as the capacitor-type electrode demonstrates energies of 178 and 52 Wh kg−1 at power of 366 and 22,500 W kg−1, respectively in 1:2 anode:cathode mass configuration.

Herein, a simple and convenient method for synthesizing trimetallic Fe/Co/Zn-ZIF-derived porous carbon as the bifunctional electrocatalyst towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been developed. The optimal trimetallic ZIF-derived carbon material shows a marked ORR catalytic activity with a more positive onset potential (Eo) of 1.010 V and half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.853 V, which is superior to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, it also exhibits the excellent OER performance with lower overpotential of 352 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH than that of RuO2 and the observed Tafel slope of 82 mV dec−1. A rechargeable ZAB assembled with the as-prepared ZIF-derived porous carbon as an air cathode displays the superior performance with a maximum current density of 240.7 mA cm−2 and a peak power density of 156.7 mW cm−2 as well as a specific capacity of 769.13 mAh g−1, much larger than those of ZAB equipped with Pt/C–RuO2.",Journal of Power Sources
Effect of cobalt doping and sugarcane bagasse carbon on the electrocatalytic performance of MoS2 nanocomposites,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdConductivity, active sites, and structural stability significantly affect the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of non-noble metals catalysts (molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)). Therefore, this work proposed a cobalt (Co) doping strategy, to improve the catalytic activity of MoS2, and MoS2 cum sugarcane bagasse derived carbon conjugate (MoS2-SCBC). The designed Co-doped MoS2 (Co-MoS2) and Co-doped SCBC-MoS2 (Co-MoS2-SCBC) nanosheets can enhance the HER activity in the acid electrolyte. The results showed that Co atoms can replace Mo atoms during the doping process of MoS2 to form covalent doping for MoS2. As a carbon carrier, SCBC did not only enhance the electronic conductivity of MoS2 and stability of the mixed structure, but also they were conducive to the dispersion of MoS2, and the exposure of more edge active sites. In addition, Co-MoS2-0.67-SCBC-0.2 showed improved HER electrochemical activity, with overpotential of 62 mV and a lowest Tafel slope of 53.86 mV dec-1 at 10 mA cm−2. The Cdl value for Co-MoS2-0.67-SCBC-0.2 was about 93.36 mF cm−2. Co-MoS2-0.67-SCBC-0.2 also exhibited high stability under acidic conditions, maintained its activity in more than 2000 cyclic voltammetry scans, and had strong durability after 12 h of 10 mA cm−2 exposure. In conclusion, this work provides a Co atom doping strategy to combine biomass waste with inert MoS2 in producing low-cost and highly active non-noble metal electrocatalysts for HER.",Fuel
Conjugated cobalt polyphthalocyanine with defective π-π extended structure for enhanced rechargeable li-oxygen batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The urgent demand for high-energy and high-power energy storage devices initiates considerable interest for Li-O2 batteries. Considering the catalytic reaction that happened on the cathode, the electrocatalyst plays a key role in deciding the performance of Li-O2 batteries. Herein, a cobalt polyphthalocyanine with defective polymeric layered structure (D-CoPPc) is prepared by an annealing treatment. The macromolecular structure of D-CoPPc overcomes the dissolution of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) therefore guarantying structural stability. Such a distinctive structure provides imperative features for Li-O2 batteries involving the intrinsic high catalytic activity of CoPc unit, high conductivity given by π-π extended conjugated skeleton. Moreover, the introduced irregular structural defects are expected to promote the diffusion of oxygen. As a result, Li-O2 battery with D-CoPPc as a catalyst achieves a high specific capacity of 4.0 mA h cm−2 at a current density of 50 μA cm−2, a remarkable rate capability with the discharge voltage reached at 2.55 V at a current density of 500 μA cm−2, and a superior cycling stability of more than 1000 h at 20 μA cm−2.

A multifunctional nano filler for solid polymer electrolyte toward stable cycling for lithium-metal anodes in lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are considered as very promising energy storage systems due to their higher theoretical performance and lower active material cost. However, the notorious shuttle effect and lithium dendrite growth have severely restricted the industrial production of Li–S batteries. In this study, we used polyethylene oxide (PEO) as the matrix and added multifunctional nanofillers (nano In2O3) to effectively inhibit the shuttle effect caused by the dissolution of lithium polysulphides (LiPSs) in Li–S batteries. As a multifunctional filler, nano-In2O3 not only improves the ionic conductivity of the PEO electrolyte, but also forms a Li–In alloy layer in situ at the polymer/anode interface, which can cause the rapid diffusion of lithium ions and prevent the side reactions between lithium metal anode and the electrolyte. Achieving the effect of stabilizing the lithium metal anode and suppressing the shuttle effect. Multiple problems in the system are solved by introducing a single component with multiple functions. The symmetrical lithium battery based on the PEO/LiTFSI/In2O3 solid polymer electrolyte (PEO/LiTFSI/In2O3 SPE) has higher cycle stability (over 1200 h) because it is more stable to the lithium metal anode. The Li–S full battery also exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. After 500 cycles at 1C, its capacity can be maintained at 570 mAh g−1, the capacity decay rate is 0.038%. The coulombic efficiency (CE) during the cycle is also close 100%.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Metal-organic framework-based glass fiber separator as an efficacious polysulfide barrier and dendrite suppressor for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The polysulfide shuttle and uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites are the two fatal troubles that obstruct the practical process of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, a composite membrane consisting of metal-organic framework (MOF) Ce-based UiO-67 and glass fiber membrane (UiO-67-GF) is proposed as a dual-functional separator for these issues. On the one hand, the introduced Ce-UiO-67 crystals are capable of efficaciously adsorbing polysulfides and catalyzing their conversion, thereby restraining their shuttle. On the other hand, this MOF provides sufficient lithium-philic functional groups for ensuring the rapid and homogeneous transport of Li ions, and thus a stable Li plating and stripping process can be acquired. Consequently, this MOF-based separator is qualified for simultaneously resolving the challenges of polysulfide shuttle and Li dendrite. The battery with the proposed separator delivers an initial capacity of 919 mAh g−1 and a limited decay rate of merely 0.04% per cycle for 500 cycles at 1 C. Moreover, even under a lean-electrolyte condition, a high area capacity of 6.0 mAh cm−2 is still obtained under the increased sulfur loading of 7.0 mg cm−2.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Coaxially grafting conjugated microporous polymers containing single-atom cobalt catalysts to carbon nanotubes enhances sulfur cathode reaction kinetics,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) hold great potential for use in energy related applications due to their extended π-conjugated structures, tunable pore sizes, and modular molecular functionalities. Herein, we report a novel composite material (labeled as Co-CMP-MWNTs) that consists of a CMP containing Co single-atom catalysts (Co SACs) and being coaxially grafted to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and show that the material synergistically promotes the cathode reaction kinetics in lithium−sulfur (Li−S) batteries. The Co-CMP-MWNTs are synthesized by coupling 2,4,6-tris(4-ethynylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine to a dibromobipyridine-Co complex in the presence of bromopyrimidinyl-functionalized MWNTs. The composite features a conductive MWNT-based core and a CMP-based shell that contains nitrogen as well as Co. Cs-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy reveal that the Co species exist as single atoms. Additional XANES data coupled with density functional theory calculations elucidate the adsorption interactions formed between the Co SACs and various sulfur species as well as their electrocatalytic effects. Li−S cells prepared using Co-CMP-MWNTs as a cathode host material exhibit excellent performance in terms of specific capacity (1485 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C), rate capability (602 mA h g−1 at 3 C), and cycling stability (510 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C after 1000 cycles, which corresponds to a capacity decay of 0.050% per cycle). Collectively, the results demonstrate that SACs can be prepared under benign conditions and used to enhance sulfur cathode reaction kinetics. The methodology described may be extended to enable the use of SACs in other contemporary energy conversion technologies.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Constructing carbon-decorated CFx nanocapsule by atomic layer deposition and catalytic chemical vapor deposition for high-capacity lithium primary battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Practical application of lithium/fluorinated carbon (Li/CFx) primary batteries in large powered devices is hindered due to the hindered delivery of its inherent capacity as a consequence of sluggish kinetics of electrode reaction and the large polarization due to poor conductivity of fluorinated carbon (CFx) in the case of a high F/C ratio. Herein, to improve the capacity performance, fluorinated carbon capsule (FCC) was decorated with conductive carbon layers by employing a combined atomic layer deposition and catalytic chemical vapor deposition (ALD-CCVD) technique. These precisely constructed carbon layers on the CFx surface maintained the original C–F bond types of FCC with a similar fluorination degree, indicating that the proposed method for capacity enhancement is effective and non-destructive. In comparison to raw FCC, the specific capacity of designed FCC@C increased up to 117.9% and 151.1% at the current densities of 0.01 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1, respectively. The enhanced electrochemical performance is predominantly derived from the synergistic effect of FCC and conductive carbon layers, which further increases the electronic conductivity, specific surface area and the number of active sites for improving Li+ diffusion. This work puts forward an effective ALD-CCVD technique to enhance the capacity performance of lithium primary batteries.",Applied Surface Science

Herein, we demonstrated the rational preparation of S-modified Fe–N–C nanosheet catalysts with hierarchical porous architecture, large specific surface area (up to 1471 m2 g−1) and controlled S doping (up to 12.3 at.%) by the co-pyrolysis of cysteine, FeCl3 with Zn-mediated MgO template. Merited from rich and accessible active sites, the catalysts display outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in terms of very small Ej3 (potential@3 mA cm−2, 0.87 V in 0.1 M KOH, 0.66 V in 0.1 M PBS (pH7.4) and 0.64 V in 0.5 M H2SO4) and overwhelming diffusion-limited current density (9.8, 6.1, 10.3 mA cm−2 in alkaline, neutral, acidic media, respectively), along with extremely respectable stability (∼90% activity retention for 53200, 26728, 43200 s in alkaline, neutral, acidic media, respectively), which underscore comparable or even better overall performance than commercial Pt/C and advanced pH-universal ORR catalysts ever reported. The as-assembled primary alkaline zinc–air battery delivers considerately large peak power density of 205 mW cm−2 and energy density up to 990.6 Wh kgZn−1 at 10 mA cm−2 (115 mW cm−2 and 676.7 Wh kgZn−1 for Pt/C-based battery), implying its highly promising application in practical energy conversion devices.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Robust hollow Bowl-like α-Fe2O3 nanostructures with enhanced electrochemical lithium storage performance,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The design and synthesis of hollow-nanostructured transition metal oxide-based anodes is of great importance for long-term operation of lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, a special hollow bowl-like α-Fe2O3 nanostructure is controllably synthesized through a facile hydrothermal technique and exhibits great electrochemical lithium storage performance when used as LIBs anode. Under a facile hydrothermal condition, α-Fe2O3 nanostructures evolve from solid pie-like structure to hollow bowl-like structure and finally α-Fe2O3 nanorings through the regulation of HPO4- derived from ionized Na3PO4·12H2O and Ostwald ripening process. The designed hollow bowl-like α-Fe2O3 nanostructure not only has the merits of hollow structure, which can accelerate the diffusion of lithium ions and electrons, but also shows great mechanical strength to disperse stress when compared to solid pie-like and ring-like α-Fe2O3 nanostructures, which would avoid collapse during charge/discharge process. As a result, the as-synthesized hollow bowl-like α-Fe2O3 nanostructure displays an initial reversible capacity of 1616 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, an excellent cycling performance with a reversible capacity of 1018 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles and an outstanding rate capability (68.1% capacity retention at current densities from 100 to 2000 mA g−1). This work provides not only a novel hollow bowl-like α-Fe2O3 nanostructure with high specific surface area and stable structure as potential electrode materials for energy storage, but also a facile self-templated strategy free of any surfactants and templates for hollow nanostructures.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Self-templated pseudomorphic transformation of ZIF into layered double hydroxides for improved supercapacitive performance,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) have been researched as excellent templates for synthesizing functional materials to be used in various fields. However, direct adoption of ZIFs as electrode material shows dissatisfactory electrochemical performance due to their limited exposed electroactive sites, poor chemical stability and sluggish charging dynamics. Herein, we demonstrate in situ transformation of ZnCo-ZIF frameworks decorated on ZnCo nanorod array (ZnCo-NA) into three-dimensional (3D) spatially distributed ZnCo-LDH/ZnCo-NA heterostructure. Owing to this unique structure that can provide abundant electroactive sites and ion transport paths in all directions, the resulting ZnCo-LDH/ZnCo-NA electrode exhibits an improved supercapacitive performance with a high capacity of 15.76 F cm−2 (1576 F g−1, 788 C g−1) at 20 mA cm−2 (2 A g−1), and maintains the capacity of 13.855 F cm−2 (1385.5 F g−1, 692.75 C g−1) at 150 mA cm−2 (15 A g−1), showing a high rate capability of 87.9%. A coin cell asymmetric supercapacitor (aSC) is assembled by employing ZnCo-LDH/ZnCo-NA as cathode and active carbon as anode, which exhibits an energy density of 21.3 Wh kg−1 and superb cycling performance with capacitance retention of 88.1% after 5000 cycles. More importantly, such a simple in-situ pseudomorphic transformation of ZIF templates into novel class LDH materials demonstrates a new generation of bimetallic heterostructure for applications in energy-related fields and beyond.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Rh single atoms/clusters confined in metal sulfide/oxide nanotubes as advanced multifunctional catalysts for green and energy-saving hydrogen productions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, smart strategies are conducted to design advanced multifunctional electrocatalysts: Co3S4/CoOx heterostructured nanosheets-assembled nanotube arrays on 3D framework integrated with single Rh atoms and subnanometer clusters. The catalyst can reach current density of 10 mA cm−2 at low overpotentials of 248.2, and 56.1 mV for oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. The catalyst also shows very low potential of 1.32 V for urea oxidation reaction at 10 mA cm−2. A water electrolyzer that achieves current density of 10 mA cm−2 at small cell voltage of 1.45 V is prepared under action of the developed catalyst. We also conduct urea electrolysis assembled with the catalyst and find that the device requires a cell voltage of only 1.35 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2, proving the great potential of our catalyst for simultaneous energy-saving H2 production and the treatment of urea-rich wastewater.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Biochar aerogel decorated with thiophene S manipulated 5-membered rings boosts nitrogen fixation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Algae contains most of the marine biogenic S, and is the main producer of dimethylsulfide, of which oxidation products contribute ~ 40% acidity of the acid rain. The biogenic S of red algae mainly exists in carrageenan molecules. In this work, 89% of C and 96% of biogenic S in carrageenan was synchronically fixed into biochar to form thiophene S decorated biochar aerogel (SCA), efficiently preventing the loss of C and S elements. More importantly, the presence of thiophene S structure in SCA can “push” electrons into the antibonding orbitals of N2, and simultaneously “pull” the lone-pair electrons from N2, thus endowing the SCA super activity for nitrogen reduction reaction. Experimentally, its NH3 yield rate reaches high as 36.69 μg h−1 mg−1cat, surpassing most metal-free electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the thiophene S can promote the absorption and activation of N2, and efficiently lower the energy barrier of N2 protonation.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Synthesis of High-Loading Pt/C Electrocatalysts Using a Surfactant-Assisted Microwave Discharge Method for Oxygen Reduction Reactions,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.High-loading Pt/C catalysts play an important role in the practical application of metal-air batteries and fuel cells because of their superior activity, high conductivity, and commercial availability. It is well known that high loadings always lead to the agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles, resulting in a loss of catalytic activity and stability; thus, it still remains a challenge to prepare high-loading Pt/C catalysts with high dispersion and small particle sizes. Here, we introduce a surfactant-assisted microwave discharge method to prepare high-loading (>40 wt %) Pt/C electrocatalysts with ultrafine particle sizes (∼3.19 nm) and good dispersion. Benefitting from the high-temperature property and reducibility of carbon-induced-arc, the surfactant and Pt precursors undergo rapid decomposition, reduction, and carbonization, generating the structure of Pt@C on carbon black. The carbon derived from the surfactant can not only inhibit the agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles but also prevent the Pt core from toxication, ensuring high activity and stability of the high-loading Pt/C catalyst. When evaluated in the oxygen reduction reaction, the as-prepared Pt/C catalyst demonstrates a comparable activity and better methanol resistance to commercial Pt/C.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Pd-Decorated Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanofibers for Enhanced Selective Hydrogenation of Phenol,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Aiming at the design and preparation of high-efficiency catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of phenol, the hierarchically porous Pd@CNF catalysts were fabricated by oxygen-activating ZIF-67/PAN composite nanofibers with O2 as the oxidant during high-temperature pyrolysis, followed by acid etching and Pd loading. Appropriate initial oxygen concentration and Co2+ molar concentration are conducive to the fabrication of hierarchically porous carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with a high mesopore and macropore ratio, increased ether-type oxygen content, and good one-dimensional (1D) morphology, which enhance the dispersion and anchoring of Pd, increase the strength of basic sites and H2 adsorption, and improve the mass transfer and dispersibility in cyclohexane. The corresponding catalyst Pd@CNFs-0.1-0.2 exhibits excellent phenol hydrogenation performance with a turnover frequency value of 66.6 h-1, which is 6.3 times that of Pd@CNFs-0.1-1 and 2.4 times that of Pd@CNFs-0.1-0. Furthermore, the 1D morphology of Pd@CNFs-0.1-0.2 enables the rapid recovery and recycling of the catalyst. This work provides a new direction for the development of efficient and easy-to-recover phenol selective hydrogenation catalysts.",Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research
Two-Dimensional Porphyrin-Based Covalent Organic Framework with Enlarged Inter-layer Spacing for Tunable Photocatalytic CO2Reduction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Two-dimensional (2D) porphyrin-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are one of the most promising candidates for photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), which however still suffer from the hindered mass transfer during the catalysis procedure associated with the close packing of 2D COF layers due to the strong axial π-πstacking. Herein, condensation between the porphyrinic aldehydes p-MPor-CHO (M = H2, Co, and Ni) and 3,8-diamino-6-phenyl-phenanthridine (DPP) affords new porphyrin-based 2D COF architecture MPor-DPP-COFs (M = H2, Co, and Ni). The bulky phenyl substituent at the phenanthridine periphery of the linking unit reduces the axial π-πstacking, providing an enlarged inter-layer spacing of 6.0 Å according to high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. This, in combination with the large surface area (1021 m2 g-1) revealed by nitrogen sorption measurements at 77 K for CoPor-DPP-COF possessing electroactive Co ions, endows it with excellent photocatalytic activity for CO2RR with a CO generation rate of 10 200 μmol g-1 h-1 and a CO selectivity up to 82%. This work affords new ideas for achieving efficient photocatalytic CO2RR upon fine-tuning the inter-layer spacing of 2D COFs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
A Porous Hexagonal Prism Shaped C-In2- xCoxO3Electrocatalyst to Expedite Bidirectional Polysulfide Redox in Li-S Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The shuttling behavior of soluble lithium polysulfides (LPSs) extremely restricts the practical application of lithium sulfur batteries (Li-S batteries). Herein, the hollow porous hexagonal prism shaped C-In2-xCoxO3composite is synthesized to restrain the shuttle effect and accelerate reaction kinetics of LPSs. The novel hexagonal prism porous carbon skeleton not only provides a stable physical framework for sulfur active materials but also facilitates efficient electron transferring and lithium ion diffusion. Meanwhile, the polar In2-xCoxO3is equipped with strong adsorption capacity for LPSs, which is confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, helping to anchor LPSs. More importantly, the doping of Co regulates the electronic structure environment of In2O3, expedites the electron transmission, and bidirectionally improves the catalytic conversion ability of LPSs and nucleation-decomposition of Li2S. Benefiting from the above advantages, the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries has been greatly enhanced. Therefore, the C-In2-xCoxO3cathode presents a good rate performance, which exhibits a low-capacity fading rate of 0.052% per cycle over 800 cycles at 5 C. Especially, even under a high sulfur loading of 4.8 mg cm-2, the initial specific capacity is as high as 903 mAh g-1, together with a superior capacity retention of 85.6% after 600 cycles at 0.5 C.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
High-Performance Flexible Polymer Memristor Based on Stable Filamentary Switching,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Polymer-based atomic switch memristors via the formation/dissolution of atomic-scale conductive filaments are considered as the leading candidate for next-generation nonvolatile memory. However, the instability of conductive filaments of incomplete bridge makes their switching performances unsatisfied. In this work, we report a flexible polymeric memristor using polyethylenimine incorporated with silver salt. The memristor device exhibited superior performances at room temperature with a favorable endurance, high ON/OFF ratio, good retention, and low operating voltage. These satisfactory performances are attributed to the pre-existing Ag ions in the polymer, guiding the formation of a robust Ag filament. In addition, the device shows stable bipolar switching behavior in bending conditions or after hundreds of bending cycles. In our work, we provide a simple and efficient method to construct robust filament-based memristors for flexible electronics.",Nano Letters

Efficient Charge Transfers in Highly Conductive Copper Selenide Quantum Dot-Confined Catalysts for Robust Oxygen Evolution Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Defective quantum dots (QDs) are the emerging materials for catalysis by virtue of their atomic-scale size, high monodispersity, and ultra-high specific surface area. However, the dispersed nature of QDs fundamentally prohibits the efficient charge transfer in various catalytic processes. Here, we report efficient and robust electrocatalytic oxygen evolution based on defective and highly conductive copper selenide (CuSe) QDs confined in an amorphous carbon matrix with good uniformity (average diameter 4.25 nm) and a high areal density (1.8 × 1012cm-2). The CuSe QD-confined catalysts with abundant selenide vacancies were prepared by using a pulsed laser deposition system benefitted by high substrate temperature and ultrahigh vacuum growth conditions, as evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance characterizations. An ultra-low charge transfer resistance (about 7 ω) determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement indicates the efficient charge transfer of CuSe quantum-confined catalysts, which is guaranteed by its high conductivity (with a low resistivity of 2.33 μω·m), as revealed by electrical transport measurements. Our work provides a universal design scheme of the dispersed QD-based composite catalysts and demonstrates the CuSe QD-confined catalysts as an efficient and robust electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction.",Inorganic Chemistry
Cocrystallization Enabled Spatial Self-Confinement Approach to Synthesize Crystalline Porous Metal Oxide Nanosheets for Gas Sensing,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Crystalline metal oxide nanosheets show exceptional catalytic performance owing to the large surface-to-volume ratio and quantum confinement effect. However, it is still a challenge to develop a facile and general method to synthesize metal oxide nanosheets. Herein, we report a cocrystallization induced spatial self-confinement approach to synthesize metal oxide nanosheets. Taking the synthesis of SnO2 as an example, the solvent evaporation from KCl and SnCl2 solution induces the cocrystallization of KCl and K2SnCl6, and the obtained composite with encapsulated K2SnCl6 can be in situ converted into SnO2 nanosheets confined in KCl matrix, after water washing to remove KCl, porous SnO2 nanosheets can be obtained. Notably, a series of metal oxide nanosheets can be obtained through this general and efficient green route. In particular, porous CeO2/SnO2 nanosheets with improved surface O− species and abundant oxygen vacancies exhibit superior gas sensing performance to 3-hydroxy-2-butanone.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Carbon-Based Materials as Lithium Hosts for Lithium Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium (Li) metal has attracted significant attention in areas that range from basic research to various commercial applications due to its high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mA h g−1) and low electrochemical potential (−3.04 vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, dendrites often form on the surfaces of Li metal anodes during cycling and thus lead to battery failure and, in some cases, raise safety concerns. To overcome this problem, a variety of approaches that vary the electrolyte, membrane, and/or anode have been proposed. Among these efforts, the use of three-dimensional frameworks as Li hosts, which can homogenize and minimize the current density at the anode surface, is an effective approach to suppress the formation of Li dendrites. Herein, we describe the development of using carbon-based materials as Li hosts. While these materials can be fabricated into a variety of porous structures, they have a number of intrinsic advantages including low costs, high specific surface areas, high electrical conductivities, and wide electrochemical stabilities. After briefly summarizing the formation mechanisms of Li dendrites, various methods for controlling structural and surface chemistry will be described for different types of carbon-based materials from the viewpoint of improving their performance as Li hosts. Finally, we provide perspective on the future development of Li host materials needed to meet the requirements for their use in flexible and wearable devices and other contemporary energy storage techniques.",Chemistry - A European Journal

Charge Separation and Surface Reaction Mechanisms for Polymeric Single-atom Photocatalysts 聚合物单原子光催化剂的载流子分离和表面反应机制,© 2022 Higher Education Press. All rights reserved.In the past decade，a large number of single-atom catalysts（SACs）have been synthesized，and they exhibited excellent catalytic performance as well as high practical and cost advantages in photo-，electro-，thermocatalysis. The uniqueness of the photocatalytic process determines that it is essentially different from the thermocatalytic and electrocatalytic processes，that is，electrons and holes at the excited state（rather than the valence electrons in the ground state）participate in the reaction. This perspective first discusses the difference between organic polymeric semiconductors and traditional inorganic semiconductors，clarifies that organic polymer semiconductors generally have small relative permittivity and the short distance between photogenerated electrons and holes（computationally，usually<1 nm），resulting in almost absent band bending at the interface of polymetric photocatalysts. The introduction of metal ions into the matrix of organic semiconductors can form efficient donor-acceptor pairs，followed by an increased lifetime of charge carriers and improved carrier separation. In the process of designing high-efficiency polymer single-atom catalysts，the excited state charge distribution after the introduction of single-atom sites and the driving force of trapped electrons on different reactions are crucial to the overall activity of the catalysts. Time-space population analysis for wavefunction analysis and transient absorption spectroscopy can provide useful information for researchers. In the near future，with the further development of artificial intelligence，establishing an energy function with a regression accuracy close to or reaching the density functional theory level to invert the energy change of the system in the excited state is expected to establish a reliable connection between the excitation property and the activity of the photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore，the role of ligands and solvation should also be carefully considered in future studies.,Gaodeng Xuexiao Huaxue Xuebao/Chemical Journal of Chinese Universities
Green synthesis of fig–like Li2S–Mo@C nanocomposites for advanced lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLithium sulfide (Li2S) is considered as a promising alternative for the intercalation–type cathode materials because of its high theoretical specific capacity (1166 mAh g–1). However, the large–scale application of Li2S is limited by its intrinsic low electronic/ionic conductivity and severe shuttle effect of polysulfides. Herein, we report a facile and green method to the in–situ synthesis of Li2S–molybdenum (Mo) nanocomposites at room temperature by mechanochemical reaction of lithium hydride with molybdenum sulfide. The fig–like carbon coated Li2S–Mo (Li2S–Mo@C) nanocomposite with core–shell structure exhibits a low initial activation barrier of 2.51 V, high reversible capacity of 742 mAh g − 1 after 70 cycles at 0.2 A g − 1 and excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles at 1.0 A g − 1. According to density functional theory calculation and experimental studies, the excellent electrochemical performance of fig–like Li2S–Mo@C nanocomposite can be attributed to the increased electronic/ionic conductivity, strong adsorption ability and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides, resulting from the synergistic effects of Mo nanodots and, carbon shell and their nanostructure. This work provides a new idea for developing large–scale applications of Li2S–based electrodes.",Electrochimica Acta
"Phototriggered Desorption of Hydrogen, Ethylene, and Carbon Monoxide from a Cu(I)-Modified Covalent Organic Framework","© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Materials that are capable of adsorbing and desorbing gases near ambient conditions are highly sought after for many applications in gas storage and separations. While the physisorption of typical gases to high surface area covalent organic frameworks (COFs) occurs through relatively weak intermolecular forces, the tunability of framework materials makes them promising candidates for tailoring gas sorption enthalpies. The incorporation of open Cu(I) sites into framework materials is a proven strategy to increase gas uptake closer to ambient conditions for gases that are capable of π-back-bonding with Cu. Here, we report the synthesis of a Cu(I)-loaded COF with subnanometer pores and a three-dimensional network morphology, namely Cu(I)-COF-301. This study focused on the sorption mechanisms of hydrogen, ethylene, and carbon monoxide with this material under ultrahigh vacuum using temperature-programmed desorption and Kissinger analyses of variable ramp rate measurements. All three gases desorb near or above room temperature under these conditions, with activation energies of desorption (Edes) calculated as approximately 29, 57, and 68 kJ/mol, for hydrogen, ethylene, and carbon monoxide, respectively. Despite these strong Cu(I)-gas interactions, this work demonstrated the ability to desorb each gas on-demand below its normal desorption temperature upon irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light. While thermal imaging experiments indicate that bulk photothermal heating of the COF accounts for some of the photodriven desorption, density functional theory calculations reveal that binding enthalpies are systematically lowered in the COF-hydrogen matrix excited state initiated by UV irradiation, further contributing to gas desorption. This work represents a step toward the development of more practical ambient temperature storage and efficient regeneration of sorbents for applications with hydrogen and π-accepting gases through the use of external photostimuli.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
On the choice of shape and size for truncated cluster-based x-ray spectral simulations of 2D materials,"© 2022 Author(s).Truncated cluster models represent an effective way for simulating x-ray spectra of 2D materials. Here, we systematically assessed the influence of two key parameters, the cluster shape (honeycomb, rectangle, or parallelogram) and size, in x-ray photoelectron (XPS) and absorption (XAS) spectra simulations of three 2D materials at five K-edges (graphene, C 1s; C3N, C/N 1s; h-BN, B/N 1s) to pursue the accuracy limit of binding energy (BE) and spectral profile predictions. Several recent XPS experiments reported BEs with differences spanning 0.3, 1.5, 0.7, 0.3, and 0.3 eV, respectively. Our calculations favor the honeycomb model for stable accuracy and fast size convergence, and a honeycomb with ∼10 nm side length (120 atoms) is enough to predict accurate 1s BEs for all 2D sheets. Compared to all these experiments, predicted BEs show absolute deviations as follows: 0.4-0.7, 0.0-1.0, 0.4-1.1, 0.6-0.9, and 0.1-0.4 eV. A mean absolute deviation of 0.3 eV was achieved if we compare only to the closest experiment. We found that the sensitivity of computed BEs to different model shapes depends on systems: graphene, sensitive; C3N, weak; and h-BN, very weak. This can be attributed to their more or less delocalized π electrons in this series. For this reason, a larger cluster size is required for graphene than the other two to reproduce fine structures in XAS. The general profile of XAS shows weak dependence on model shape. Our calculations provide optimal parameters and accuracy estimations that are useful for x-ray spectral simulations of general graphene-like 2D materials.",Journal of Chemical Physics
Hydrodeoxygenation of Palmitic Acid with Novel Two-Dimensional Ti3C2T xMXene-Supported Ni Catalyst,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of fatty acids to alkanes is key to convert renewable resources into biofuels. Here, we design a new Ti3C2Tx MXene-confined Ni catalyst with extraordinary catalytic performance in the HDO of palmitic acid. Due to the large two-dimensional surface and chemical activity, Ti3C2Tx MXene is able to disperse and anchor Ni particles through strong synergistic coupling. As a consequence, the obtained Ni/Ti3C2Tx catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance with a complete conversion of palmitic acid. It can be recycled in five runs without activity reduction, demonstrating good stability of the as-prepared catalyst. The facilitated catalytic performance can be ascribed to the synergic effect of metal Ni and Ti3C2Tx MXene. Ti3C2Tx MXene facilitates the adsorption and conversion of palmitic acid to aldehyde. The dispersed Ni particles benefit from the hydrogenation of hexadecanal intermediate with the cleavage of C-C bonds and the dehydration-hydrogenation of hexadecanol to form alkanes.",Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research

Thermal Properties of MXenes and Relevant Applications,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The properties and applications of MXenes (a family of layered transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides) have aroused enormous research interests for a decade since the successful synthesis of few-layer transition metal carbides in 2011. Though MXenes, as the building blocks, have already been applied in various fields (such as wearable electronics) owing to the distinctive optical, mechanical and electrical properties, their thermal stability and intrinsic thermal properties were less thoroughly investigated compared to other characteristics in early reports. The pioneering theoretical prediction of the thermoelectric nature of MXenes was performed in 2013 while the first experiment-based report concerning the degradation behavior of the 2D structure at elevated temperatures in a controlled atmosphere was published in 2015, followed by numerous discoveries regarding the thermal properties of MXenes. Herein, after a brief description of the synthesis, this Review summarized the latest insights into the thermal stability and thermophysical properties of MXenes, and further associated these unique properties with relevant applications by multiple examples.

Accelerating the theoretical study of Li-polysulfide adsorption on single-atom catalysts via machine learning approaches,"© 2022 The Authors. International Journal of Quantum Chemistry published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.Li–S batteries are a promising alternative to Li-ion batteries, offering large energy storage capacity and wide operating temperature range. However, their performance is heavily affected by the Li-polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling. Computational screening of LiPS adsorption on single-atom catalyst (SAC) substrates is of great aid to the design of Li–S batteries which are robust against the LiPS shuttling from the cathode to the anode and the electrolyte. To facilitate this process, we develop a machine learning (ML) protocol to accelerate the systematic mapping of dominant local energy minima found with calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT), and, in turn, fast screening of LiPS adsorption properties on SACs. We first validate the approach by probing the potential energy surface for LiPS adsorbed on graphene decorated with a Fe–N4–C SAC. We identify minima whose binding energies are better or on par with the one previously reported in the literature. We then move to analyze the adsorption trends on Zn–N4–C SAC and observe similar adsorption strength and behavior with the Fe–N4–C SAC, highlighting the good predictive power of our protocol. Our approach offers a comprehensive and computationally efficient alternative to conventional approaches studying LiPS adsorption.",International Journal of Quantum Chemistry
Enhanced oxygen reduction of porous N-doped carbon nanosheets with graphitic N and defects obtained from coal-based graphene quantum dots,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal-free carbon-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have received considerable attention owing to their abundance and low cost. However, designing carbon-based electrocatalysts with excellent performance in a facile manner remains a challenge. In this work, porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet (PNCNs) catalysts with high contents of graphitic N and defects were readily prepared via a simple self-doping method, in which coal-based graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were used as the carbon and nitrogen resource. Based on the results, PNCNs-900 (obtained at 900 °C) displayed good ORR performance, with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.80 V. It also exhibited high stability and methanol tolerance compared with commercial Pt/C. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations prove that the increased ORR electrocatalytic activity of PNCNs-900 is due to the synergistic effect of a large number of defects and graphitic N. Furthermore, its higher electrocatalytic activity for ORR also benefits from the porous lamellar structure, which facilitates the mass transfer process. This study offers a novel approach for developing effective ORR catalysts and for the high value-added utilization of coal resources.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
An ant-nest like hierarchical nanoreactor for highly efficient sulfur species redox reactions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The main challenge in the practical exploitation of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is to resolve the problems of the sluggish liquid-solid conversions and the diffusion loss of liquid polysulfides especially at high sulfur loading. Herein, a novel bio-inspired reactor with ant-nest like architecture was tailored for Li-S electrochemistry, which combines abundant active nickel nanoparticles with hierarchical porous carbon-nanosheets network (HPCN/Ni). The nanoreactor provides multiple functions including strong trapping efficiency with polysulfides, fast transfer of ions/electrons and liquid sulfur species, and sufficient catalytic activity. The cooperative effects could accelerate Li-S redox reactions and improve sulfur utilization. Enhanced by the highly efficient HPCN/Ni naonoreactor, Li-S cells demonstrate a high specific capacity of 1437.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, remarkable rate performances such as 900 mAh g−1 at 2 C, and exellent cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 734.2 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 1 C. Even at a high sulfur area loading of 5.63 mg cm−2, a high area capacity of 4.75 mAh cm−2 could be achieved. This contribution affords a fesible approach to design and construct nanoreactors with high efficiency for Li-S batteries and the analogous applications.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Review—Heteroatom-Doped High Porous Carbon Metal Free Nanomaterials for Energy Storage and Conversion,"© 2022 The Electrochemical Society (“ECS”). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.The fuel cell is one of the most environmentally friendly methods for sustainably converting chemical energy to electricity. The broad use of the oxygen reduction process (ORR) at the cathode has been hindered up until this point by the pricy platinum catalysts required. The amount of noble metal needed for the requisite catalytic effect may be reduced using nonprecious-metal catalysts. Still, they are either too expensive for the commercial mass production of clean energy or their energy conversion efficiency is too low. The cheap cost, broad surface area, high electrical conductivity, abundant electrocatalytic active sites, and corrosion-resistant features have led to a new class of carbon-based, metal-free catalysts. These catalysts might significantly reduce the price and increase the effectiveness of fuel cells when utilized as substitute ORR catalysts. This review article describes several metal-free carbon-based catalysts that have been developed employing very complex designs and rational heteroatom doping (by intrinsic and macroscopic tuning).",ECS Journal of Solid State Science and Technology
Recent progress of Ga-based liquid metals in catalysis,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Within the last decade, the application of gallium-based liquid metals in catalysis has received great attention from around the world. This article provides an overview concerning Ga-based liquid metals (LMs) in energy and environmental applications, such as the catalytic synthesis of ethylene by non-petroleum routes via Pd-Ga liquid catalysts, alkane dehydrogenation via Pd-Ga or Pt-Ga catalysts, CO2 hydrogenation to methanol via Ni Ga or Pd/Ga2O3 catalysts, and catalytic degradation of CO2via EGaIn liquid metal catalysts below 500 °C, where Ga-based liquid metal catalysts exhibit high selectivity and low energy consumption. The formation of isolated metal sites in a liquid metal matrix allows the integration of several characteristics of multiphase catalysis (particularly the operational friendliness of product separation procedures) with those of homogeneous catalysis. In the end, this article sheds light on future prospects, opportunities, and challenges of liquid metal catalysis.",RSC Advances
Designing Hollow Carbon Sphere with Hierarchal Porous for Na-S Systems with Ultra-Long Cycling Stabilities,"© 2022 by the authors.Captured by the low-cost and high theoretical specific capacity, Na-S systems have garnered much attention. However, their intermediate products (dissolved polysulfide) are always out of control. Considering the excellent space confinements and conductivity, they have been regarded as promising candidates. Herein, the hollow spheres with suitable thickness shell (~20 nm) are designed as hosting materials, accompanied by in-depth complexing. Benefitting from the abundant micro-pores (mainly about conical-type and slits-type pores < 1.0 nm), the active S4 molecules are successfully filled in the pores through vacuum tube sealing technology, effectively avoiding the process from solid S8 to liquid Na2S6. As cathode for Na-S systems, their capacity could remain at 920 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C after 100 cycles. Even at 10.0 C, the capacity still remained at about 310 mAh g−1 after 7000 cycles. Supported by the detailed kinetic behaviors, the improvement of ions diffusion behaviors is noted, bringing about the effective thorough redox reactions. Moreover, the enhanced surface-controlling behaviors further induces the evolution of rate properties. Therefore, their stable phase changing is further confirmed through in situ resistances. Thus, the work is anticipated to offer significant design for hosting carbon materials and complexing manners.",Molecules
Effective BiOCl Electrons Collector for Enhancing Photocarrier Separation of Bi2WO6/BiOCl Composite,"© 2022 by the authors.Enhancing photocarrier separation is a key step of photocatalysis, and in situ constructed composition interface is an advanced method to achieve this aim. Therefore, we report a face-to-face Bi2WO6/BiOCl (BWOC) which was synthesized via the continuous in situ ion-exchange method. As UV light is harmful to the human body, BWOC exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity only in visible light, and this is an important feature because visible light is a human-friendly operating condition. Under 50 W visible LED lamp illumination, unexcited BiOCl (BOC) only extracts electrons of excited Bi2WO6 (BWO), and holes remain on BWO, resulting in excellent photocarrier spatial separation efficiency through the face-to-face interface. This is why BWOC can be safe to use for the removal of hazardous substances. Compared with BWO and BOC, BWOC possesses 2.6 and 5.6 times higher photodegradation activity than RhB. This work provides a novel insight of efficient visible light photocatalytic system for environmental remediation.",Chemistry (Switzerland)
Growth and Characterization of Ultrathin Vanadium Oxide Films on HOPG,"© 2022 by the authors.Integration of graphene into various electronic devices requires an ultrathin oxide layer on top of graphene. However, direct thin film growth of oxide on graphene is not evident because of the low surface energy of graphene promoting three-dimensional island growth. In this study, we demonstrate the growth of ultrathin vanadium oxide films on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface, which mimics the graphene surface, using (oxygen-assisted) molecular beam epitaxy, followed by a post-annealing. The structural properties, surface morphology, and chemical composition of the films have been systematically investigated by in situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction during the growth and by ex situ techniques, such as atomic force microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Crystalline monolayer vanadium oxide can be achieved on HOPG by systematically tuning the deposition time of V atoms and by subsequent annealing at 450 °C in controlled atmospheres. Increasing the partial pressure of O2 during the deposition seems to decrease the mobility of V atoms on the graphitic surface of HOPG and promote the formation of a two-dimensional (2D) vanadium oxide. The obtained oxide layers are found to be polycrystalline with an average grain size of 15 nm and to have a mixed-valence state with mainly V5+ and V4+. Moreover, XPS valence band measurements indicate that the vanadium oxide is insulating. These results demonstrate that a 2D insulating vanadium oxide can be grown directly on HOPG and suggest vanadium oxide as a promising candidate for graphene/oxide heterostructures.",Nanomaterials
CuCo2S4 Nanoparticles Embedded in Carbon Nanotube Networks as Sulfur Hosts for High Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 by the authors.Rational design of sulfur hosts for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is essential to address the shuttle effect and accelerate reaction kinetics. Herein, the composites of bimetallic sulfide CuCo2S4 loaded on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are prepared by hydrothermal method. By regulating the loading of CuCo2S4 nanoparticles, it is found that when Cu2+ and CNT are prepared in a 10:1 ratio, the CuCo2S4 nanoparticles loaded on the CNT are relatively uniformly distributed, avoiding the occurrence of agglomeration, which improves the electrical conductivity and number of active sites. Through a series of electrochemical performance tests, the S/CuCo2S4-1/CNT presents a discharge specific capacity of 1021 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C after 100 cycles, showing good cycling stability. Even at 1 C, the S/CuCo2S4-1/CNT cathode delivers a discharge capacity of 627 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles. This study offers a promising strategy for the design of bimetallic sulfide-based sulfur hosts in Li-S batteries.",Nanomaterials
Strategic design of Fe and N co-doped hierarchically porous carbon as superior ORR catalyst: from the perspective of nanoarchitectonics,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.In this study, we present microporous carbon (MPC), hollow microporous carbon (HMC) and hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) to demonstrate the importance of strategical designing of nanoarchitectures in achieving advanced catalyst (or electrode) materials, especially in the context of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Based on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and ORR studies, we identify a marked structural effect depending on the porosity. Specifically, mesopores are found to have the most profound influence by significantly improving electrochemical wettability and accessibility. We also identify that macropore contributes to the rate capability of the porous carbons. The results of the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) method also demonstrate the advantages of strategically designed double-shelled nanoarchitecture of HPC to increase the overall electron transfer number (n) closer to four by offering a higher chance of the double two-electron pathways. Next, selective doping of highly active Fe-Nx sites on HPC is obtained by increasing the nitrogen content in HPC. As a result, the optimized Fe and N co-doped HPC demonstrate high ORR catalytic activity comparable to the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C in alkaline electrolyte. Our findings, therefore, strongly advocate the importance of a strategic design of advanced catalyst (or electrode) materials, especially in light of both structural and doping effects, from the perspective of nanoarchitectonics.",Chemical Science
Highlighting the Implantation of Metal Particles into Hollow Cavity Yeast-Based Carbon for Improved Electrochemical Performance of Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 by the authors.The introduction of metal particles into microbe-based carbon materials for application to lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries has the three major advantages of pore formation, chemisorption for polysulfides, and catalysis of electrochemical reactions. Metal particles and high specific surface area are often considered to enhance the properties of Li–S batteries. However, there are few data to support the claim that metal particles implanted in microbe-based carbon hosts can improve Li–S battery performance without interfering with the specific surface area. In this work, hollow-cavity cobalt-embedded yeast-based carbon (HC–Co–YC) with low specific surface area was successfully produced by impregnating yeast cells with a solution containing 0.075 M CoCl2 (designated as HC–Co–YC–0.075M). Cobalt particles implanted in yeast carbon (YC) could improve the conductive properties, lithium-ion diffusion, and cycling stability of the sulfur cathode. Compared to previously reported counterpart electrodes without metal particles, the HC–Co–YC–0.075M/S electrode in this study had a high initial specific capacity of 1061.9 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, maintained a reversible specific capacity of 504.9 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles, and showed a capacity fading rate of 0.1049% per cycle. In conclusion, the combination of cobalt particles and YC with low specific surface area exhibited better cycle stability, emphasizing the importance of implantation of metal particles into carbon hosts for improving the electrochemical properties of Li–S batteries.",Catalysts
Mesoporous Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks,"© Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology. All rights reserved.The zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) with threedimensionalperiodicmicroporesencounter thebarrier of mass transfer in the diffusion-limited processes. To solve this problem, fabricating the ZIFs combined intrinsicmicropores with ordered mesopores (mZIFs) is highly desirable. Herein, mZIFs were synthesized for the first time, achieved by employing a polymer-micelle template strategy. The chemical structure of mZIFs could be readily regulated via the coordination of different transition-metal ions and imidazolate linkers, whereas their mesopore size could be tuned by the length of the hydrophobic block within polymer micelles. mZIFs remarkably accelerated the diffusionlimiting processes such as catalysis because of the hierarchical pore structures, accessible active sites, and high accommodation of the reactants. In addition, their pyrolytic carbons inherit the original pore features; thus, exhibiting excellent electrocatalytic performances for the oxygen reduction reaction.",CCS Chemistry
Anion–Cation Co-Doped g-C3N4 Porous Nanotubes with Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Evolution Performance,"© 2022 by the authors.Graphitic C3N4-based materials are promising for photocatalytic H2 evolution applications, but they still suffer from low photocatalytic activity due to the insufficient light absorption, unfavorable structure and fast recombination of photogenerated charge. Herein, a novel anion–cation co-doped g-C3N4 porous nanotube is successfully synthesized using a self-assembly impregnation-assisted polymerization method. Ni ions on the surface of the self-assembly nanorod precursor can not only cooperate with H3P gas from the thermal cracking of NaH2PO2 as an anion–cation co-doping source, but, more importantly, suppress the shape-collapsing effect of the etching of H3P gas due to the strong coordinate bonding of Ni-P, which leads to a Ni and P co-doped g-C3N4 porous nanotube (PNCNT). Ni and P co-doping can build a new intermediate state near the conduction band in the bandgap of the PNCNT, and the porous nanotube structure gives it a higher BET surface area and light reflection path, showing a synergistic ability to broaden the visible-light absorption, facilitate photogenerated charge separation and the light-electron excitation rate of g-C3N4 and provide more reaction sites for photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction. Therefore, as expected, the PNCNT exhibits an excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 240.91 μmol·g−1·h−1, which is 30.5, 3.8 and 27.8 times as that of the pure g-C3N4 nanotube (CNT), single Ni-doped g-C3N4 nanotube (NCNT) and single P-doped g-C3N4 nanotube (PCNT), respectively. Moreover, the PNCNT shows good stability and long-term photocatalytic H2 production activity, which makes it a promising candidate for practical applications.",Nanomaterials
"Molybdenum Carbide Anchored on N,S Co-Doped Carbon Composite Derived from Lignosulfonate as a High Performance Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction","© 2022 by the authors.A composite of Mo2C nanoparticles dispersed onto a nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon scaffold (Mo2C/N,S-C) was prepared by a simple and environmentally friendly method of one-pot annealing of MoCl5, urea, and lignosulfonate under a N2 atmosphere at 700 °C. Lignosulfonate, a by-product of the sulfite pulping process, was employed as a feedstock to fabricate the S-doped carbon scaffold and carbide simultaneously, and urea acted as a nitrogen source for N-doping to carbon. The as-prepared Mo2C/N,S-C catalyst showed high performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with a small overpotential of 105 mV at 10 mAcm−2, and good stability for 3000 cycles. The improved HER performance of the Mo2C/N,S-C originated from the interplay between the highly active Mo2C nanoparticles and the N,S co-doped carbon scaffold with its high electrical conductivity and large surface area. Furthermore, N,S co-doping to carbon improved the hydrophilicity of the catalyst surface, thus further enhancing the HER activity.",Nanomaterials
Will lithium-sulfur batteries be the next beyond-lithium ion batteries and even much better?,"© 2022 The Authors. InfoMat published by UESTC and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are undoubtedly the current working-horse in almost all portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, and even large-scale stationary energy storage. Given the problems faced by LIBs, a big question arises as to which battery(ies) would be the “Beyond LIBs” batteries. Among the front-runners, lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been extensively pursued owing to their intrinsically high energy density and extremely low cost. Despite the steady and sometimes exciting progress reported on sulfur chemistry and cell performance at laboratory scales over the past decade, one of the major bottlenecks is the poor cyclability. In this perspective, we examine the key challenges and opportunities faced by LSBs, as well as approaches at the materials, electrode/electrolyte and cell integration levels that can be taken to transform LSBs from a front-runner to a real leading champion in the pursuit of the “Beyond LIBs”. While the key new mechanistic insights are very important, we propose a set of the near-future research directions for both the liquid and solid state LSBs, where the currently on-going parallel pursuits of both liquid and solid LSBs will be converging. The “liquid current” will gradually be taken over by “solid future” in the expected LSBs commercialization in the coming decade. (Figure presented.).",InfoMat
Stereoactive Metallic Vanadium Oxide Barriers to Boost Silicon-Based Lithium-Ion Storage,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Despite the intensive efforts devoted to confining silicon (Si)-based materials with heteromatrices for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries, addressing practical issues with rationally incorporated stereoactive matrix is still a significant challenge. This study presents an electrochemical-active, metallic matrix for boosting Si-based lithium-ion storage. By employing a straightforward strategy involving mechanical ball-milling and controllable phase transformation, spatially confined Si-based composites enabled by metallic vanadium oxide (VO0.9) barriers can be readily achieved. The scalable interface engineering allows for expanded transportation channels and maintained structural integrity, which can be well established in both SiOx and Si cases. Endowed with promoted electron conduction as well as fast lithium-ion diffusion, the optimal Si-based composite electrodes demonstrate remarkable lithium storage performance, that is, an initial Coulombic efficiency of 81%, and a high specific capacity of 1249 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1 after 100 cycles. Notably, full cells coupled with a commercial LiCoO2 cathode are demonstrated, affording impressive specific energy of 440 Wh kg−1 at high mass loading. This work provides a cost-effective approach to promoting the practical application of Si-based anodes, which also holds promise for extension towards energy-related applications and beyond.",Advanced Materials Interfaces
Coupling Atomically Dispersed Fe–N5 Sites with Defective N-Doped Carbon Boosts CO2 Electroreduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Atomically dispersed iron immobilized on nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst has attracted enormous attention for CO2 electroreduction, but still suffers from low current density and poor selectivity. Herein, atomically dispersed Fe-N5 active sites supported on defective N-doped carbon successfully formed by a multistep thermal treatment strategy with the aid of dicyandiamide are reported. This dual-functional strategy can not only construct intrinsic carbon defects by selectively etching pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N, but also introduces an additional N from the neighboring carbon layer coordinating to the commonly observed Fe-N4, thus creating an Fe-N5 active site supported on defective porous carbon nanofibers (Fe-N5/DPCF) with a local 3D configuration. The optimized Fe-N5/DPCF achieves a high CO Faradaic efficiency (>90%) over a wide potential range of −0.4 to −0.6 V versus RHE with a maximal FECO of 93.1%, a high CO partial current density of 9.4 mA cm−2 at the low overpotential of 490 mV, and a remarkable turnover frequency of 2965 h−1. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the synergistic effect between the Fe-N5 sites and carbon defects can enhance electronic localization, thus reducing the energy barrier for the CO2 reduction reaction and suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction, giving rise to the superior activity and selectivity.",Small
Interfacial engineering on metal anodes in rechargeable batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMetal anodes (Li, Na, K, Zn, Mg, Ca, Fe, Al, Mn, etc.) based on a plating/stripping electrochemical mechanism have attracted great attention in rechargeable batteries because of their low electrochemical potential, high theoretical specific capacity, and superior electronic conductivity. Metal anodes exhibit large potential in constructing high-energy-density rechargeable batteries. However, challenges such as high chemical reactivity, large volume changes, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and uneven electrochemical deposition result in a serious of interfacial issues on metal anodes, including corrosion, side reaction, structural instability, and formation of dendrites.

Multifunctional Atomic Molybdenum on Graphene with Distinctive Coordination to Solve Li and S Electrochemistry,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The improvement of lithium–sulfur batteries is still impeded by notorious shuttling effect and sluggish kinetics on the S cathode, and rampant Li dendrite formation on the Li anode makes it worse. Herein, a type of single-atom dispersed Mo on nitrogen-doped graphene (Mo/NG) with a distinctive Mo-N2O2-C coordination structure first serving as a multifunctional material is designed by a structure-oriented strategy to solve Li and S electrochemistry. Mo/NG with superior intrinsic properties endowed by the unique coordination configuration adsorbs soluble polysulfides and promotes bidirectional conversion of LiPSs at the cathode side. Meanwhile, the suitable binding strength of Mo/NG with lithium ions endows it with an attractive lithiophilic feature. Specifically, Mo/NG is able to work as the adaptor to redistribute lithium ions on the interface of separator and homogenize the lithium ion flux. Due to the suitable binding ability with Li+, it does not interfere with the diffusion of lithium ions across and provides tunnels exclusive to lithium ions to generate fast and homogeneous flux. Ascribed to such unique multifunctionality, Li–S batteries assembled with Mo/NG exhibit excellent electrochemical performance including long cycling stability over 1000 cycles and high areal capacities under high sulfur mass loading.",Small
Nanoscale Diamane Spiral Spring for High Mechanical Energy Storage,"© 2022 The Authors. Small published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.A compact, stable, sustainable, and high-energy density power supply system is crucial for the engineering deployment of mobile electromechanical devices/systems either at the small- or large-scale. This work proposes a spiral-based mechanical energy storage scheme utilizing the newly synthesized 2D diamane. Atomistic simulations show that diamane spiral can achieve a high theoretical gravimetric energy density of about 564 Wh kg−1, about 14 500 times the steel spring. The interlayer friction between diamane is found to cause a strong stick–slip effect that results in local stress/strain concentration. As such, the energy storage capacity of the diamane spiral can be tuned by suppressing the influence from the interlayer friction. Simulations affirm that higher gravimetric energy density can be achieved by reducing the turn number or adopting a low friction contact pair. The fundamental principles that dominate the energy storage capacity of the spiral spring are theoretically analyzed, respectively. The obtained insights suggest that the 2D vdW solids can be promising candidates to construct spiral structures with a high gravimetric energy density. This work should be beneficial for the design of reliable, stable, and sustainable nanoscale mechanical energy storage schemes that can be used as an alternative low-carbon footage energy supplier for novel micro-/nanoscale devices or systems.",Small
"S-doped M-N-C catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction: Synthetic strategies, characterization, and mechanism","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Due to the strong electronegativity of the N atom, the adsorption energy of the transition metal –nitrogen active site for the ORR intermediate is too high to facilitate the subsequent elementary reactions. It is worth noting that introducing sulfur atoms in transition metal–nitrogen–carbon catalysts can optimize the charge distribution of nitrogen atoms around metal sites to improve the electronic structure and structural defects of the catalysis, so as to boost the adsorption and transfer of oxygen-containing intermediates. Meanwhile, sulfur-doping can also inhibit metal nanoparticle formation and promote hierarchical porous carbon formation.

Shining light on ZnIn2S4 photocatalysts: Promotional effects of surface and heterostructure engineering toward artificial photosynthesis,"© 2022 The Authors. EcoMat published by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.The gradual depletion of fossil fuel reserves that contribute to ~85% of global energy production and release of toxic effluents urges the transformation toward renewable fuels. Thus, the sustainable utilization of sunlight for water splitting and CO2 reduction with heterogeneous photocatalysts has come to light. As a semiconductor photocatalyst, ZnIn2S4 has hit the limelight owing to its narrow bandgap and visible-light-responsive properties. However, the limitations of ZnIn2S4 include limited active sites, fast charge-carrier recombination, and low photoconversion efficiency.

Low-Temperature High-Areal-Capacity Rechargeable Potassium-Metal Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.High mass loading and high areal capacity are key metrics for commercial batteries, which are usually limited by the large charge-transfer impedance in thick electrodes. This can be kinetically deteriorated under low temperatures, and the realization of high-areal-capacity batteries in cold climates remains challenging. Herein, a low-temperature high-areal-capacity rechargeable potassium–tellurium (K–Te) battery is successfully fabricated by knocking down the kinetic barriers in the cathode and pairing it with stable anode. Specifically, the in situ electrochemical self-reconstruction of amorphous Cu1.4Te in a thick electrode is realized simply by coating micro-sized Te on the Cu collector, significantly improving its ionic conductivity. Meanwhile, the optimized electrolyte enables fast ion transportation and a stable K-metal anode at a large current density and areal capacity. Consequently, this K–Te battery achieves a high areal capacity of 1.25 mAh cm−2 at −40 °C, which greatly exceeds those of most reported works. This work highlights the significance of electrode design and electrolyte engineering for high areal capacity at low temperatures, and represents a critical step toward practical applications of low-temperature batteries.",Advanced Materials
Eliminating Lightning-Rod Effect of Lithium Anodes via Sine-Wave Analogous MXene Layers,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium metal anodes are regarded as the most promising candidate for rechargeable lithium-based batteries, but uncontrollable Li dendrites hinder further applications. Here, sine-wave analogous MXene (Ti3C2Tx) (SWA-MXene) layers are produced by spreading aqueous MXene dispersion onto the sectional surface of a metallic coil and subsequently drying at room temperature. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations demonstrate that the low curvature in SWA-MXene layers homogenizes the distributions of lithium ions and electric field, efficiently eliminating the lightning-rod effect on the surface of aligned electrodes in the process of Li deposition. As a result, the flexible SWA-MXene layers show a low overpotential for lithium nucleation (≈13.5 mV at 0.05 mA cm−2) and deep plating–stripping capacities up to 40 mAh cm−2, as well as a long cycle life up to 1250 h. Full cells consisting of a SWA-MXene–Li anode and a LiFePO4 cathode also exhibit a durable cycle life up to 420 cycles at 1088 mA g−1.",Advanced Energy Materials
Advanced Strategies for Stabilizing Single-Atom Catalysts for Energy Storage and Conversion,"© 2022, The Author(s).Well-defined atomically dispersed metal catalysts (or single-atom catalysts) have been widely studied to fundamentally understand their catalytic mechanisms, improve the catalytic efficiency, increase the abundance of active components, enhance the catalyst utilization, and develop cost-effective catalysts to effectively reduce the usage of noble metals. Such single-atom catalysts have relatively higher selectivity and catalytic activity with maximum atom utilization due to their unique characteristics of high metal dispersion and a low-coordination environment. However, freestanding single atoms are thermodynamically unstable, such that during synthesis and catalytic reactions, they inevitably tend to agglomerate to reduce the system energy associated with their large surface areas. Therefore, developing innovative strategies to stabilize single-atom catalysts, including mass-separated soft landing, one-pot pyrolysis, co-precipitation, impregnation, atomic layer deposition, and organometallic complexation, is critically needed. Many types of supporting materials, including polymers, have been commonly used to stabilize single atoms in these fabrication techniques. Herein, we review the stabilization strategies of single-atom catalyst, including different synthesis methods, specific metals and carriers, specific catalytic reactions, and their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, this review focuses on the application of polymers in the synthesis and stabilization of single-atom catalysts, including their functions as carriers for metal single atoms, synthetic templates, encapsulation agents, and protection agents during the fabrication process. The technical challenges that are currently faced by single-atom catalysts are summarized, and perspectives related to future research directions including catalytic mechanisms, enhancement of the catalyst loading content, and large-scale implementation are proposed to realize their practical applications. Graphical Abstract: Single-atom catalysts are characterized by high metal dispersibility, weak coordination environments, high catalytic activity and selectivity, and the highest atom utilization. However, due to the free energy of the large surface area, individual atoms are usually unstable and are prone to agglomeration during synthesis and catalytic reactions. Therefore, researchers have developed innovative strategies, such as soft sedimentation, one-pot pyrolysis, coprecipitation, impregnation, step reduction, atomic layer precipitation, and organometallic complexation, to stabilize single-atom catalysts in practical applications. This article summarizes the stabilization strategies for single-atom catalysts from the aspects of their synthesis methods, metal and support types, catalytic reaction types, and its advantages and disadvantages. The focus is on the application of polymers in the preparation and stabilization of single-atom catalysts, including metal single-atom carriers, synthetic templates, encapsulation agents, and the role of polymers as protection agents in the manufacturing process. The main feature of polymers and polymer-derived materials is that they usually contain abundant heteroatoms, such as N, that possess lone-pair electrons. These lone-pair electrons can anchor the single metal atom through strong coordination interactions. The coordination environment of the lone-pair electrons can facilitate the formation of single-atom catalysts because they can enlarge the average distance of a single precursor adsorbed on the polymer matrix. Polymers with nitrogen groups are favorable candidates for dispersing active single atoms by weakening the tendency of metal aggregation and redistributing the charge densities around single atoms to enhance the catalytic performance. This review provides a summary and analysis of the current technical challenges faced by single-atom catalysts and future research directions, such as the catalytic mechanism of single-atom catalysts, sufficiently high loading, and large-scale implementation.

The Future for Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries: From Persisting Issues to Promising Solutions and Practical Applications,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries are emerging as promising candidates for stationary energy-storage systems, due to their high energy density, resource abundance, and environmental benignity. A better understanding of RT-Na/S batteries in the view of the whole battery components is of essential importance for fundamental research and practical applications. In particular, the components other than sulfur cathodes in preventing the migration of polysulfides and accelerating the reaction kinetics have been greatly overlooked. Such a biased research trend is also adverse to the broader applications for RT-Na/S batteries, which have long been ignored in previous reviews. Herein, approaches to the historical progress toward practical RT-Na/S batteries through a “teamwork” perspective are comprehensively summarized, and balanced research trends are encouraged to enable practical RT-Na/S batteries. In the meantime, the persisting issues, promising solutions, and practical applications of advanced sulfur host design, Na metal anode protection, electrolyte optimization, separator modification, and binder engineering are clearly emphasized. Finally, the device-scale evaluation in practical parameters and advanced characterization tools are thoroughly provided.

A Nonaqueous Mg-CO2 Battery with Low Overpotential,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Mg-CO2 batteries, which exploit the greenhouse gas CO2 as cathode active species, are an appealing next-generation battery candidate due to their high efficiency energy storage and value-added CO2 utilization. However, compared with other metal-CO2 systems, few aprotic Mg-CO2 batteries have been reported so far as a result of several crucial problems including the comparatively slow redox reaction kinetics, a large decomposition energy barrier of the reduction products, and poor reversibility in their multi-electron three-phase cathodic reactions in nonaqueous environments. Herein, a rechargeable Mg-CO2 battery is developed by using a Mo2C-CNTs catalytic cathode, a nonaqueous electrolyte, and a magnesium metal anode. The Mo2C-CNTs catalytic cathode can greatly reduce the charge overpotential of the Mg-CO2 battery through tuning the CO2 reduction pathways. The results of a variety of ex situ and in situ experiments as well as theoretical calculations show the Mo2C catalyst not only induces surface molecular adsorption for faster reaction kinetics but also improves the selectivity toward MgC2O4 in the CO2 reduction process for a higher Faraday efficiency. An exceptional low voltage hysteresis is achieved for the Mg-CO2 battery. This work demonstrates a promising strategic option for rechargeable nonaqueous Mg-CO2 batteries for simultaneously addressing energy and environmental issues.",Advanced Energy Materials
A Universal Spinning-Coordinating Strategy to Construct Continuous Metal–Nitrogen–Carbon Heterointerface with Boosted Lithium Polysulfides Immobilization for 3D-Printed Li-S Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Constructing intimate coupling between transition metal and carbon nanomaterials is an effective means to achieve strong immobilization of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in the applications of lithium–sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, a universal spinning-coordinating strategy of constructing continuous metal–nitrogen–carbon (M-N-C, M = Co, Fe, Ni) heterointerface is reported to covalently bond metal nanoparticles with nitrogen-doped porous carbon fibers (denoted as M/M-N@NPCF). Guided by theoretical simulations, the Co/Co-N@NPCF hybrid is synthesized as a proof of concept and used as an efficient sulfur host material. The polarized Co-N-C bridging bonds can induce rapid electron transfer from Co nanoparticles to the NPCF skeleton, promoting the chemical anchoring of LiPSs to improve sulfur utilization. Hence, the as-assembled Li-S battery presents a remarkable capacity of 781 mAh g−1 at 2.0 C and a prominent cycling lifespan with a low decay rate of only 0.032% per cycle. Additionally, a well-designed Co/Co-N@NPCF-S electrode with a high sulfur loading of 7.1 mg cm−2 is further achieved by 3D printing technique, which demonstrates an excellent areal capacity of 6.4 mAh cm−2 at 0.2 C under a lean-electrolyte condition. The acquired insights into strongly coupled continuous heterointerface in this work pave the way for rational designs of host materials in Li-S systems.",Advanced Science
Probing Dynamic Self-Reconstruction on Perovskite Fluorides toward Ultrafast Oxygen Evolution,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Exploring low cost, highly active, and durable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of prime importance to boost energy conversion efficiency. Perovskite fluorides are emerging as alternative electrocatalysts for OER, however, their intrinsically active sites during real operation are still elusive. Herein, the self-reconstruction on newly designed Ni-Fe coupled perovskite fluorides during OER process is demonstrated. In situ Raman spectroscopy, ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and theoretical calculation reveal that Fe incorporation can significantly activate the self-reconstruction of perovskite fluorides and efficiently lower the energy barrier of OER. Benefiting from self-reconstruction and low energy barrier, the KNi0.8Fe0.2F3@nickel foam (KNFF2@NF) electrocatalyst delivers an ultralow overpotential of 258 mV to afford 100 mA cm−2 and an excellent durability for 100 h, favorably rivaling most the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts. This protocol provides the fundamental understanding on OER mechanism associated with surface reconstruction for perovskite fluorides.",Advanced Science
Transition Metals Embedded Siloxene as Single-Atom Catalyst for Advanced Sulfur Host in Lithium–Sulfur Batteries: A Theoretical Study,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The practical applications of lithium–sulfur batteries are presently hindered by the shuttle effect, sluggish reaction kinetics, and poor electronic conductivity of sulfur. Siloxene, a new 2D nanomaterial with three types of structures (Weiss, chain like, and Kautsky), is regarded to be a promising cathode-supporting material for Li–S batteries. Herein, a series of 3d transition metal single-atom embedded siloxenes (TM-SA-siloxenes) is designed and their potential in Li–S batteries is evaluated by first-principles calculations. It is found that Weiss-siloxene shows the best polysulfide anchoring ability and lowest Gibbs free energy for the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR). Among a series of TM-SA-siloxenes, Co-SA-siloxene is identified as the optimal candidate. It shows moderate adsorption energies for polysulfides and outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for SRR and Li2S decomposition, as well as excellent electronic conductivity. It is also revealed that suitable d and p band center positions, obvious hybridization between Co–3d and S–3p orbitals, and more charge obtained from adsorbed polysulfides, contribute to the high redox kinetics of Co-SA-siloxene for the catalyzing conversion of polysulfides. These interesting results provide valuable theoretical guidance for the study of siloxene-based cathode host materials for Li–S batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials
Single-atomic Mn sites coupled with Fe3C nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon matrixes derived from bimetallic Mn/Fe polyphthalocyanine conjugated polymer networks for accelerating electrocatalytic oxygen reduction,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.The construction of robust coupling catalysts for accelerating electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) through the modulation of the electronic structure and local atomic configuration is critical but remains challenging. Herein, we report a facile and effective isolation-polymerization-pyrolysis (IPP) strategy for high-precision synthesis of single-atomic Mn sites coupled with Fe3C nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped porous carbon matrixes (Mn SAs/Fe3C NPs@NPC) catalyst derived from predesigned bimetallic Fe/Mn polyphthalocyanine (FeMn-BPPc) conjugated polymer networks by solid-phase reaction approach. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between the single-atomic Mn-N4 sites and Fe3C NPs as well as the confinement effect of NPC, the Mn SAs/Fe3C NPs@NPC catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for ORR. The assembled Zn-air battery displayed larger power density of 186 mW·cm−2 than that of Pt/C + Ir/C-based battery. It also exhibits excellent stability without obvious voltage change after 106 cycles with 36 h. Combing in-situ Raman spectra with in-situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) characterization results indicated that the Mn-N4 site as an active site for the O2 adsorption-activation process, which effectively facilitates the generation of key *OOH intermediates and *OH desorption to promote the multielectron reaction kinetics. Theoretical calculation reveals that the excellent electrocatalytic performance originates from the charge redistribution and the d orbital shift resulting from Mn-Fe bond, which buffers the activity of ORR through the electron reservoir capable of electron donation or releasing. This work paves a novel IPP strategy for constructing high-performance coupling electrocatalyst towards the ORR for energy conversion devices. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano Research
Altering Local Chemistry of Single-Atom Coordination Boosts Bidirectional Polysulfide Conversion of Li–S Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom catalysts affording multifarious typed metal centers and varied coordination numbers are extensively employed in Li−S realm to promote redox kinetics. Nevertheless, the modulation of coordination environment pertaining to local atomic composition to dictate the catalytic efficiency toward sulfur electrochemistry, has remains meaningful yet unexplored thus far. In this contribution, a new type of single-atomic iron mediator with a designed FeN3P1 coordination structure is reported to boost bidirectional polysulfide conversion in comparison with FeN4 counterpart. Theoretical calculations imply that the substitution by one P atom at the first-coordination shell of Fe center will be beneficial to strengthen adsorption toward sulfur species and reduce energy barrier for Li2S decomposition. The bidirectional electrocatalytic behavior for polysulfide conversion via FeN3P1 mediator is confirmed by electrokinetic analysis. Consequently, the constructed Li−S battery achieves elongated lifespan with a capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle at 1.0 C and exhibits considerable capacity release of 6.2 mAh cm−2 even under a sulfur loading of 6.4 mg cm−2. This strategy of local composition engineering offers a vivid example in probing the correlation between the definitive structure of single atoms and their catalytic performance in Li−S chemistry.",Advanced Functional Materials

Therefore, this study fabricates Co3O4-RuO2 hollow spheres using a facile and eco-friendly solvothermal and low temperature oxidation procedure followed by ice water treatment (IW-Co3O4-RuO2-HS).

Mo-induced in-situ architecture of NixCoyP/Co2P heterostructure nano-networks on nickel foam as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) exhibit excellent competitiveness for electrochemical splitting water due to their high electrical conductivity and remarkable physicochemical stability. However, pure single-phase TMPs still possess some disadvantages, such as the limited number of active sites and difficulty in greatly accelerating mass/charge transfer. Elemental doping is a practical way to manipulate the intrinsic electronic structures of TMPs and optimize the adsorption and desorption process of intermediates during the water splitting reaction. Rational construction of heterostructure electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and excellent durability shows great potential for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we developed a nickel foam (NF)-supported NixCoyP/Co2P heterostructure anchoring on N-doped carbon (NixCoyP/Co2P@NF) via the phosphating of the organic frameworks (ZIF-67) with Mo species added. The as-synthesized NixCoyP/Co2P@NF catalyst shows a unique three-dimensional (3D) nano-network morphology with a large specific surface area and abundant channels for mass exchange. Mo doping alters the valence electronic states of the constituent elements in the initial phase (NixCoyP), thus optimizing the proton transfer from P sites to metal sites, while Co species in the secondary phase (Co2P) is conducive to the water decomposition. Moreover, the heterogeneous interface between initial and secondary phases accelerates electron conduction and further enhances the electrocatalytic efficiency. The NixCoyP/Co2P@NF catalyst shows overpotentials of 170 mV for HER and 352 mV for OER at a current density of 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. The current density can reach 100 mA cm−2 by applying a voltage of 1.75 V for overall water splitting in an alkaline water electrolyzer with NixCoyP/Co2P@NF acting as the anodic and cathodic electrodes. This work has achieved a heterostructure catalyst via the heteroatom-dopant induced phase transition and offered an interfacial engineering strategy for further improving the activity of bifunctional TMP catalysts.",Sustainable Materials and Technologies

Cobalt-embedded 3D conductive honeycomb architecture to enable high-sulphur-loading Li-S batteries under lean electrolyte conditions,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.High sulphur loading and lean electrolyte conditions are important to achieve the high theoretical energy density of lithium-sulphur (Li-S) batteries. However, serious problems such as low sulphur utilization and fast capacity fade are typically experienced under low electrolyte/sulphur (E/S) ratios and high sulphur loading conditions. To address these issues, a cobalt-containing three-dimensional conductive honeycomb (Co@N-HPC) is proposed in this work as a material for sulphur cathodes. The good electrical conductivity and high density of catalytic sites of (Co@N-HPC) allow fast redox kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) in high-sulphur-loading electrodes. In addition, the hierarchical structure and good wettability by the electrolyte of Co@N-HPC facilitates electrolyte penetration and LiPS conversion, leading to a high utilization of sulphur under lean electrolyte conditions. Therefore, at a current density of 0.2 C, a volumetric capacity of 1,410 mAh·cm−3 was attained with a sulphur loading of 5.1 mg·cm−2 and an E/S ratio of 5 µL·mg−1. This work provides ideas for the development of lean electrolyte Li-S batteries with a high sulphur loading. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano Research

Surface-redox pseudocapacitive materials can meet this demand due to their fast surface Faradaic reaction kinetics and superior structure stability during charging–discharging. Herein, a free-standing anode by growing VN particle-composed nanosheets on carbon fibers (VN@CFs) is developed. The VN@CFs is endowed with high reversible capacity of 245.8 mA h g–1 at 0.05 A g–1, high rate performance of 102.7 mA h g–1 at 6.0 A g–1, and long-term stability. Based on the in situ XRD, ex situ XPS and TEM characterizations, and density functional theory calculations, it is proved that the potassium storage of VN derives from a surface-redox pseudocapacitive mechanism between VN and K+, rather than an intercalation or conversion reaction. As expected, the as-assembled PICs based on the VN@CFs anode show an ultrahigh power output of 10.9 kW kg–1 when keeping an energy density of 49.2 Wh kg–1 and excellent capacity retention of 86.8% after 15000 cycles.",Advanced Functional Materials
Facet Strain Strategy of Atomically Dispersed Fe-N-C Catalyst for Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Increasing the portion of highly active metal centers in atomically dispersed M-N-C catalysts is significant for the overall oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. A “facet strain strategy” is designed by using a trans-layer compressive strain of the {110} facet of FeCo nanoparticles encapsulated in graphitic Fe-N-C layers to further activate the primitive FeN4 catalytic centers on the graphitic sub-layer that are omitted in commonly direct access activation strategies. Using X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure, the highly active FeN4 type is detected with compressed Fe-N bonds. Density functional theory calculation discloses that, in virtue of lattice mismatch, FeCo {110} facets transmit a trans-layer compressive strain to reconstruct the FeN4 sites on surrounding graphitic sub-layers to optimize the Fe-OH* adsorption energy in the rate-determining step. The redesigned catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR activity, outperforming the primitive Fe-N-C and commercial Pt/C benchmarks. This study will enrich insights toward developing MN4 and nanoparticle composite electrocatalysts.",Advanced Functional Materials

In recent years, the pharmaceutical and agriculture field attained enormous progress to meet the necessities of health and life; however, discharge of trace amounts of pharmaceuticals and pesticides into water significantly have a negative influence on human health and the environment. Contamination with these pollutants also constitutes a great threat to the aquatic ecosystem. To deal with the harmful impacts of such pollutants, their expulsion has attracted researchers’ interest a lot, and it became essential to figure out techniques suitable for the removal of these pollutants. Thus, many researchers have devoted their efforts to improving the existing technology or providing an alternative strategy to solve this environmental problem. One of the attractive materials for this purpose is metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their superior high surface area, high porosity, and the tunable features of their structures and function. Among various techniques of wastewater treatment, such as biological treatment, advanced oxidation process and membrane technologies, etc., metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials are tailorable porous architectures and are viably used as adsorbents or photocatalysts for wastewater treatment due to their porosity, tunable internal structure, and large surface area. MOFs are synthesized by various methods such as solvo/hydrothermal, sonochemical, microwave and mechanochemical methods. Most common method used for the synthesis of MOFs is solvothermal/hydrothermal methods. Herein, this review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in MOFs and their derivatives, focusing on the following aspects: synthesis and applications. This review comprehensively highlights the application of MOFs and nano-MOFs to remove pharmaceuticals and pesticides from wastewater. For the past years, transition metal-based MOFs have been concentrated as photocatalyst/adsorbents in treating contaminated water. However, work on main group metal-based MOFs is not so abundant.

Anti-catalytic and zincophilic layers integrated zinc anode towards efficient aqueous batteries for ultra-long cycling stability,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Aqueous zinc-based battery is usually plagued by serious dendrites and side reactions including Zn corrosion and water decomposition on the anode. To address the drawbacks, constructing coating layers with high conductivity and anti-catalytic effects on hydrogen evolution reaction has been considered as an efficient strategy. Herein, cheap and abundant two-dimensional (2D) conductive graphite (KS-6) coating layer with high electronic conductivity (∼ 106 S·m−1) could directly form strong bonding with Zn foil due to high zincophilicity, which correspondingly protects Zn metal from liquid electrolyte to inhibit parasitic hydrogen evolution and guide uniform Zn electrodeposition during cycling. The KS-6 layer owns a profitable charge redistribution effect to endow Zn anode with a lower nucleation energy barrier and a more uniformly distributed electric field compared with bare Zn. Therefore, such integrated Zn anode exhibits low voltage hysteresis (∼ 38 mV) and excellent cycling stability with dendrite-free behaviors (1 mA·cm−2 and 2 mA·cm−2) over 2,000 h, far outperforming many reported Zn metal anodes in aqueous systems. Encouragingly, in light of the superior Zn@KS-6 anode, VNOx powders and Prussian blue analogs Mn2Fe(CN)6 are applied as the cathode materials to assemble full batteries, which show remarkable cycling stabilities and high Coulombic efficiencies (CEs) over 200 cycles with capacity retention of 81.5% for VNOx//Zn@KS-6 battery and over 400 cycles with capacity retention of 94.6% for Mn2Fe(CN)6//Zn@KS-6 battery, respectively.

In situ mineralized Ca3(PO4)2 inorganic coating modified polyethylene separator for high-performance lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The organic–inorganic composite separator possesses great thermal stability and electrolyte wettability, which is normally prepared via the slurry containing binder. However, this preparation is involved with large amounts of organic solvent that is harmful to health. In this paper, we design a novel method that combines the crosslinking technology and biomimetic mineralization process to prepare a Ca3(PO4)2 inorganic coating modified polyethylene separator (CaP@PE). The obtained composite separator exhibits stronger affinity to electrolyte, and its porous coating structure can store more liquid electrolyte, thus the ionic conductivity is promoted from 0.27 mS cm−1 to 0.52 mS cm−1 and the lithium-ion transference number is increased from 0.26 to 0.36. Compared with PE separator, CaP@PE separator shows better thermal stability at high temperature. Due to the improved ionic transport performance and reduced charge transfer impedance, LiCoO2/Li half-cell employing CaP@PE separator displays superior cycle stability and capacity retention ability after 150 cycles at a current density of 1C. Even at a high rate of 5C (7.5 mA cm−2), the cell with CaP@PE separator still exhibits a discharge capacity of 0.80 mAh. This work provides a promising separator to optimize the electrochemical performance and safety performance in lithium-ion battery.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
Microwave-assisted rapid MAX phase etching and delamination: A paradigm shift in MXene synthesis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.This work describes a novel and rapid strategy to produce delaminated MXene sheets from the MAX phase. The current method uses a novel microwave-assisted hydrothermal method to etch aluminium (Al) from the MAX phase (as well as delaminate) within 2 h of processing which has remarkably reduced time from up to 48 h to 30 min and temperature from 180 to 40 °C.

Nanofiber-reinforced clay-based 2D nanofluidics for highly efficient osmotic energy harvesting,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdClay-based 2D nanofluidics are promising candidates for promoting practical application of osmotic energy harvesting owing to their low cost and simple large-scale preparation, but they usually suffer from poor mechanical strength and unsatisfactory ion selectivity. Herein, the nanofiber reinforcement strategy is proposed to address these two key issues of clay-based 2D nanofluidics for achieving highly-efficient osmotic energy harvesting. The aramid nanofibers (ANFs) are intercalated into lameller montmorillonite (MMT) membrane to construct robust 2D nanofluidics. In this configuration, the introduction of negatively-charged ANFs greatly enhances the mechanical strength of MMT nanofluidic membrane, and further improves the cation selectivity towards high-efficient osmotic energy conversion. The ANF-reinforced MMT nanofluidics could delivery a maximum power output up to ~5.16 W m−2 under 50-fold salinity gradient (KCl) simulating sea/river junction environment, which is remarkably superior to almost all reported clay-based 2D nanofluidics. The osmotic power can be further increased to 6.45 W m−2 at a higher temperature of 50 ºC. Furthermore, the 2D nanofluidic membrane can withstand extreme water environments such as strong acidity/alkalinity and high salinity for over 20 days. This work is envisaged to provide a new strategy in the construction of robust clay-based 2D nanofluidics towards pushing osmotic energy harvesting into real-world applications.",Nano Energy

Rational design of a hollow porous structure for enhancing diffusion kinetics of K ions in edge-nitrogen doped carbon nanorods,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.The high electrical conductivity makes it possible for one-dimensional (1D) carbon materials to be used as the promising anodes for potassium ion batteries (PIBs), however, the sluggish diffusion kinetics caused by large-sized potassium ions (K+) limits their practical applications in energy storage systems. In this work, hollow carbon nanorods were rationally designed as a case to verify the superiority of 1D hollow structure to improve the diffusion kinetics of K+. Simultaneously, edge-N (pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N) atoms were also introduced into 1D hollow carbon structure, which can provide ample active sites and defects in graphitic lattices to adsorb K+, providing extra capacitive storage capacity. As expected, the optimized edge-N doped hollow carbon nanorods (ENHCRs) exhibits a high reversible capacity of 544 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 A·g−1 after 200 cycles. Even at 5 A·g−1, it displays a long-term cycling stability with 255 mAh·g−1 over 10,000 cycles. The electrochemical measurements confirm that the hollow structure is favorable to improve the transfer kinetics of K+ during cycling. And the theoretical calculations demonstrate that edge-N doping can enhance the local electronegativity of graphitic lattices to adsorb much more K+, where edge-N doping synergizes with 1D hollow structure to achieve enhanced K+-storage performances.

Electronic band structure reveals that, model-I of MoSSe-Zr2Co2(WSSe-Zr2CO2) and MoSSe-Hf2CO2(WSSe-Hf2CO2) vdWHs are indirect type-I(-II) bandgap semiconductors. In case of model-II of MSSe-N2CO2 vdWH, the valance band maxima (VBM) and conduction band minima (CBM) lies from different monolayers, hence confirm type-II band alignment. Furthermore, in these vdWHs, transition of electrons between two different constituents (layers) of the vdWHs, greatly facilitates effective separation for photogenerated charge carriers. Absorption spectra are also calculated to understand the optical behavior of these systems. Favorable band edge positions of MSSe-N2CO2 vdWHs also facilitate water splitting at pH = 0 in photocatalysis. Our simulated design of MSSe-N2CO2 vdWHs is promising for future optoelectronic, and photocatalytic device applications.",Chemical Physics
Two-dimensional host materials for lithium-sulfur batteries: A review and perspective,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries are considered as promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices due to their high capacity and high energy density. However, their large-scale practical applications suffer from a series of challenges, such as the insulating nature of sulfur, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and the volume expansion upon lithiation. Numerous research work proved that modification of the cathodes with host materials is efficient for alleviating these issues. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently emerged as a candidate of choice for the sulfur host materials. Herein, a comprehensive review of the recent advances in 2D sulfur host materials is presented, including the mechanism of Li–S batteries and the basic requirement for hosts. Furthermore, different types of 2D hosts are summarized and discussed in detail. Finally, an outlook of possible research directions, challenges, and perspectives are presented.

New UV-initiated lithiated-interpenetrating network gel-polymer electrolytes for lithium-metal batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A new lithiated-interpenetrating network gel-polymer electrolytes (LIPN-GPEs) is designed and fabricated by ultraviolet-irradiation radical polymerization. The LIPN-GPEs includes both cross-linked poly (lithiated 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid-co-polyethylene glycol acrylate) matrix C–P(AMPSLi-MPEGA) and polyacrylonitrile (C-PAN), which forms the interpenetrating framework. The interpenetrating network ensures the mechanical strength and flexibility that eliminates volume changes of lithium anode during lithium deposition/stripping process. Meanwhile, the LIPN-GPEs with better self-supporting nature and high ionic conductivity (2.5 × 10−3 S/cm) can promote the movement of lithium ion resulting in more uniform distribution, which realizes uniform lithium deposition with stable SEI composition. Therefore, the LIPN-GPEs indicates excellent interfacial stability towards lithium anode. Symmetrical lithium metal cell yields low overpotential of 50 mV over 4000 h at 0.5 mA cm−2. The LIPN-GPEs with optimized ratio exhibits wider electrochemical window (5.06 V vs. Li/Li+) at ambient temperature, which also possesses unexceptional thermal stability with decomposition temperature up to 400 °C. Especially, when assembled with high-voltage cathode LiCoO2 (LCO) and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) as coin cells, the LIPN-GPEs reveals cycling performance, reflecting good high-voltage resistance characteristic. This work testifies that LIPN-GPEs through a convenient ultraviolet-irradiation radical polymerization provides a candidate for lithium metal battery, which furnishes application prospects in wearable devices.",Journal of Power Sources
Correlation between self-discharge behavior and heteroatoms over doped carbon sheets for enhanced pseudocapacitance,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesFor electric double layer supercapacitors, carbon materials originating from the purely physical energy-storage mechanism limit the improvement in the capabilities of charge storage. To solve this problem, doping heteroatoms into carbon skeleton is a promising & charming strategy for enhancing electrochemical performance by providing the extra pseudocapacitance. However, the self-discharge behavior of such heteroatom-doped supercapacitors has been a challenging issue for a long time. Here, the porous carbon nanosheets with a tunable total content of heteroatoms are chosen as a demo to systemically decouple the correlation between the total content of heteroatoms and the specific capacitance as well as the self-discharge behavior. The capacitance changes in a range of 164–331 F g−1 @ 1 A g−1 with the increased total contents of doped heteroatom, strongly dependent on and sensitive to the total content of heteroatoms. The voltage retention rate and capacitance retention rate for the porous carbon nanosheets with a tunable total content of heteroatoms completely present a quick decline tendency as the increase in the content of heteroatoms, changing from 58% to 34% and 74% to 39%, respectively, indicative of a linear negative relationship. More importantly, the self-discharge mechanisms are elaborately explored and follow the combination of activation- and diffusion-controlled Faradic reactions. This work illustrates the diverse impacts of the doped heteroatoms on the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors, covering specific capacitance and self-discharge behavior, and highlights the importance of balancing the contents of doped heteroatoms in energy storage fields.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Composite cathode materials for next-generation lithium fluorinated carbon primary batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Currently, lithium fluorinated carbon (Li/CFx) primary batteries have been considered as one of the most promising electrochemical energy supply technologies in the military and medical fields, owing to multiple advantages including high energy density, low self-discharge rate, and good safety. Nevertheless, the intrinsic contradiction between capacity and conductivity of CFx materials together with special surface LiF passivation mechanisms during lithiation process, inevitably result in poor power density and severe voltage hysteresis. To address these problems, designing composite cathodes by integrating CFx with other materials (e.g. carbon, polymer, metal oxide, metal) is an effective solution. In this review, representative progresses of CFx materials are firstly introduced, accompanied with systematical analysis on key mechanisms and scientific issues. Subsequently, a series of CFx-based composite cathodes with unique characteristics and advantages are comprehensively discussed and compared. Finally, general design rules of composite cathodes are proposed based on clarifying the relationships between composition, structure, and performance. This review not only provides guideline for designing advanced CFx-based cathode materials, but also inspires further development of primary lithium batteries with superior energy density and power density.",Journal of Power Sources
Bridging Multiscale Characterization Technologies and Digital Modeling to Evaluate Lithium Battery Full Lifecycle,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The safety, durability and power density of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently inadequate to satisfy the continuously growing demand of the emerging battery markets. Rapid progress has been made from material engineering to system design, combining experimental results and simulations to enhance LIB performance. Limited by spatial and temporal resolution, state-of-the-art advanced characterization techniques fail to fully reveal the complex multi-scale degradation mechanism in LIBs. Strengthening interaction and iteration between characterization and modeling improves the understanding of reaction mechanisms as well as design and management of LIBs. Herein, a seed cyber hierarchy and interactional network framework is demonstrated to evaluate the overall lifecycle of LIBs. The typical examples of bridging the characterization techniques and modeling are discussed. The critical parameters extracted from multi-scale characterization can serve as digital inputs for modeling. Furthermore, advanced computational techniques including cloud computing, big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence can also promote the comprehensive understanding and precise control of the whole battery lifecycle. Digital twins techniques will be introduced enabling the real-time monitoring and control of LIBs, autonomous computer-assisted characterizations and intelligent manufacturing. It is anticipated that this work will provide a roadmap for further intensive research on developing high-performance LIBs and intelligent battery management.",Advanced Energy Materials
Three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous Co3O4 decorated with Mg as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for high-performance zinc-air batteries,"© 2022Developing low-cost and high-efficiency bifunctional catalysts for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical to expedite the widespread implementation of rechargeable zinc-air batteries. Herein, a unique Mg-decorated three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous (3DOM) Co3O4 electrocatalyst is engineered and evaluated as cathodic material for zinc-air batteries. The modulation of electronic structure and bonding configuration of Co sites through coordination with substituted Mg atoms effectively enhance the interaction with oxygen species and, therefore, the ORR/OER activity. Meanwhile, the substitution of Co2+ with Mg2+ creates abundant, more catalytically active octahedral sites (Co3+) in 3DOM-MgxCo3−xO4. Moreover, the tailored 3D interpenetrating porous structure endows the electrocatalyst with large diffusion channels for oxygen species and highly accessible active sites. The as-prepared catalyst retains 99% and 98% of its initial ORR and OER current, respectively, after 16 h under chronoamperometric measurement. The zinc-air battery assembled with 3DOM-MgxCo3−xO4 exhibits a high power density of 253 mW cm−2 and long-term cyclability over 236 h, outperforming the commercial noble-metal based catalysts in terms of performance and stability. This work offers a straightforward and promising design strategy for development of robust bifunctional electrocatalysts toward practical applications of zinc-air batteries.",Nano Energy
Quantitative defect regulation of heterostructures for sulfur catalysis toward fast and long lifespan lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.The advancement of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is severely retarded by lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling behavior and sluggish redox kinetics. Herein, the heterogeneous composite with defective Bi2Se3−x nanosheets and porous nitrogen-doped carbon (Bi2Se3−x/NC) is prepared by selenizing bismuth metal-organic frameworks as a multifunctional sulfur host. The highly efficient immobilization-conversion on LiPSs is realized by the synergistic effect of structure construction strategy and defect engineering. It is found that Bi2Se3−x with the suitable amount of selenium vacancies achieves the best electrochemical performance due to the advantages of its structure and composition. These results confirm the intrinsic correlation between defects and catalysis, which are revealed by computational and experimental studies. Due to these superiorities, the developed sulfur electrodes exhibited admirable stability and a fairly lower capacity decay rate of approximately 0.0278% per cycle over 1,000 cycles at a 3 C rate. Even at the high sulfur loading of 6.2 mg·cm−2, the cathode still demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 455 mAh·g−1 at 1 C. This work may enlighten the development of mechanism investigation and design principles regarding sulfur catalysis toward high-performance Li-S batteries.

Fibrous organosulfur cathode materials with high bonded sulfur for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Organosulfur compounds are promising cathode materials for lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries because of their sustainability, lightweight, and environmental kindness. Recently, sulfurized-polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) with chemically anchored sulfur has drawn tremendous attention. However, the low sulfur content in the SPAN (mostly below 50 wt%) hampers its practical application as a cathode material in Li–S batteries. Herein, we introduce trithiocyanuric acid (TTCA) with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to synthesize fibrous sulfurized TTCA/PAN (STTCA@SPAN) via an electrospinning technique followed by inverse vulcanization. The thiol groups in TTCA are more readily oxidizing in the sulfurization process and increased the sulfur content to 58 wt% in the fibrous STTCA@SPAN composite. The chemically bonded short-chain sulfur species endow STTCA@SPAN cathode excellent compatibility with carbonate-based electrolytes. Moreover, the fibrous cathodes exhibit an initial discharge capacity of 1301 mAh g−1, excellent cycle stability over 400 cycles, and high-rate capabilities of 1028, 957, 827, and 660 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 C-rates, respectively. The cross-linked fibrous morphology maintains the structural stability of the cathode after a continuous charge/discharge process.",Journal of Power Sources
Ru-optimized geometric sites of cations in CoFe/CoFe2O4 electrocatalysts with graphitic carbon shells for boosting water oxidation,"© 2022Rational fabrication of an electrocatalyst with excellent stability, conductivity, and activity is urgently demanded for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, Ru-regulated hierarchical CoFe/CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with graphitic carbon shells were successfully fabricated via self-assembling and vapor reduction strategies. Our investigation uncovers high concentrations of octahedral Co3+ sites in electrocatalysts can be triumphantly acquired via moderate Ru doping, which could give rise to excellent electrocatalytic activities during OER. In addition, the design of CoFe alloys and graphitic carbon shells can compensate for the weak conductivity of cobalt ferrites. Based on the intrinsic stability, improved conductivity and activity, the as-prepared electrocatalyst yields a low overpotential of 237 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec−1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, exhibiting outstanding electrocatalytic activities for OER.",Electrochimica Acta
Anion-modulated molybdenum oxide enclosed ruthenium nano-capsules with almost the same water splitting capability in acidic and alkaline media,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHydrogen production by water electrolysis is extremely limited by high energy consumption due to high overpotentials, forcing people have to develop catalysts that can efficiently catalyze the water splitting reaction. However, currently most transition metal-based catalysts can only be used in alkaline environments, because most of them are unstable in acidic and highly oxidative environments, as well as single-purposed. Therefore, it is a great challenge to seek for stable bifunctional catalysts with high hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER&OER) kinetics in wide pH range. Although Ru nanoparticles possess high activity, they easily suffer leaching and oxidation inactivation. To this, a bifunctional Ru@MoO(S)3 nano-capsule structure electrocatalyst applied to the wide pH range is designed and built, in which Ru nanoparticles are harmoniously encapsulated in a sulfur-modulated molybdenum oxide (MoO(S)3) shell. This all-in-one integration allows Ru to retain intrinsic catalytic activity and rapid mass transfer process while preventing Ru from electrochemical oxidation and then guaranteeing recyclability. Specially, Ru@MoO(S)3 drives the water splitting in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 only needs 1.522 V and 1.526 V cell voltage, respectively, with nearly 100 % Faraday efficiency. This is the first report that a catalyst possesses almost the same water splitting activity in acidic and alkaline media, and also significantly surpasses the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalyst electrode pairs. In addition, in the 24 h constant current water splitting test, Ru@MoO(S)3 has very small current density decay. This work provides a new insight into design of bifunctional electrocatalysts for efficient pH-wide water splitting.",Nano Energy
Physisorption of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene on novel zeta arsenene nanotubes – A first-principles study,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The structural stability of novel ζ-arsenene nanotubes (ζ-AsNT) is studied based on the density functional theory framework and is used as a base material for the detection of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene vapours. The formation energy of ζ-AsNT is found to be −4.321 eV/atom and the energy band gap is 0.304 eV. Besides, the changes in the electronic properties of ζ-AsNT are explored with regard to the projected density of states, charge transfer, and electron density difference. The bandgap energy decreases for hollow site orientation to 0.205 and 0.204 eV for trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene vapours and increases for the valley and top site orientations. The adsorption energies were maximum for the valley site orientation of target molecules onto ζ-AsNT (01.165 and −1.513 eV for trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, respectively). Moreover, the target vapours trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are physisorbed on ζ-AsNT enabling the recycling of base substrate for continuous operation. The average energy gap changes vary from 18 to 32.9% depending on adsorption sites. The variation in the average energy gap owing to adsorption of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene indicates the chemo-sensing nature of ζ-AsNT. The current report lays the inroads in the development of a new sensing element for the detection of chloroethylene molecules.",Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling
Operando electrochemical pressiometry probing interfacial evolution of electrodeposited thin lithium metal anodes for all-solid-state batteries,"© 2022All-solid-state Li metal batteries with ultimate energy density require stabilization at the Li/solid electrolyte interfaces. Further, the use of conventional thick (hundreds of μm) Li metal anodes (LMAs) hinders an impartial evaluation of full cells. In this study, interfacial evolution is compared for thin LMAs (∼ 10 μm thick) prepared by a scalable electrodeposition, with varying protective In/LixIn layer formed via electroless plating. The positive effects of the In/LixIn layer are confirmed for both Li/Li6PS5Cl/Li symmetric cells and LiNi0.70Co0.15Mn0.15O2/Li6PS5Cl/Li full cells. Complementary analysis including electrochemical, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, operando electrochemical pressiometry, and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy measurements discloses complex Li/Li6PS5Cl interfacial evolutions affected by the In/LixIn coatings, that is, suppressed side reactions and penetrating Li growth. Importantly, a new indicator from operando electrochemical pressiometry analysis, the capacity-normalized pressure change difference Δ(ΔPQ) successfully predicts the dendritic growth of Li during cycling of LiNi0.70Co0.15Mn0.15O2/Li full cell.",Energy Storage Materials
Fluoroalkyl ether electrolyte with sulfur-wetting and shuttling-inhibition functionalities for high-rate lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries have been acknowledged as one of the most fascinating energy storage devices due to their remarkable theoretical energy density. However, low conductivity and polysulfide shuttling are notorious challenges for their commercial applications. Here, by directly introducing fluoroalkyl ether 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl-1,1,2,3,3,3-hexafluoropropyl ether (THE) into commercial ether electrolytes, we design a fluoroalkyl ether electrolyte to improve high-rate cyclic performance of Li–S battery. As confirmed by density functional theory calculations, in-situ Raman, and electron density maps, the THE electrolyte, with abundant high-polarity CF3 and CF2 groups, fully wets the sulfur cathode and inhibits the polysulfide shuttling, owing to the intense repulsive interaction (1.97 eV) with polysulfide ions and the robust absorption interaction (−2.42 eV) with sulfur cathode. With the THE electrolyte, the Li–S battery cycling 500 times at 5 C (10.5 mA cm−2) delivers a capacity retention of 53.3%, holding promise for developing high-rate, long-period Li–S batteries.",Journal of Power Sources

Single-atom site catalysts (SACs) with monometal-center as the quintessential ADMCs have been extensively studied in the catalysis-related fields. Beyond SACs, novel atomically dispersed metal catalysts (NADMCs) with flexible active sites featuring two or more catalytically centers including dual-atom and triple-atom catalysts have drawn ever-increasing attention recently. Owing to the presence of multiple neighboring active sites, NADMCs could exhibit much higher activity and selectivity compared with SACs, especially in those complicated reactions with multi-step intermediates. This review comprehensively outlines the recent exciting advances on the NADMCs with emphasis on the deeper understanding of the synergistic interactions among multiple metal atoms and underlying structure–performance relationships. It starts with the systematical introduction of principal synthetic approaches for NADMCs highlighting the key issues of each fabrication method including the atomically precise control in the design of metal nuclearity, and then the state-of-the-art characterizations for identifying and monitoring the atomic structure of NADMCs are explored. Thereafter, the recent development of NADMCs in energy-related applications is systematically discussed.

Constructing flame-retardant gel polymer electrolytes via multiscale free radical annihilating agents for Ni-rich lithium batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Parasitic multiscale free radical reactions of electrolytes not only deteriorate battery performance but also cause a fire hazard. Therefore, fundamentally blocking free radical reactions is a smart strategy for simultaneous improvement. Herein, a multiscale free radical annihilating agent hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene cross-linked tannic acid microsphere (HT) is unprecedentedly applied to polyethylene glycol diacrylate based in-situ constructed polymer electrolytes (PEGGPE@HT), which significantly annihilates free radicals from electrolytes at high-voltage and high temperature. The electrochemical stability of PEGGPE@HT is improved to 4.5 V (Li/Li+). The capacity retention rate of the LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811)//Li cell is increased to 85.3% after 200 cycles at 1 C and that of the LiFePO4//Li cell is up to 96.4% after 400 cycles at 1 C by the presence of HT. Moreover, the effectiveness of this strategy has also been further validated in the NCM811//Graphite pouch full cell and high loading NCM811//ultra-thin Li cell. Furthermore, benefiting from the annihilation of phosphorus radicals generated from HT at high temperatures, the PEGGPE@HT shows good flame retardancy and endows the pouch cell with excellent fire safety. Additionally, the pouch cell also features excellent mechanical abuse resistance. This facile synthesis is compatible with the existing battery industry process, which renders great potential for PEGGPE@HT to construct competitive LIBs with high energy density and high safety in large-scale applications.",Energy Storage Materials

Tunable polycationic organohalloysite electrocatalyst: Synthesis and characterisation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Methylamine and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether were used as monomers, in a sequential manner, to build from the surface of an aminosilane-grafted halloysite a quaternary ammonium polyelectrocatalyst. The as obtained material was characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms (BET method), elemental analysis (EA), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). XRD analysis showed that the pristine halloysite was in a partial dehydrated state with a d001 value of 0.74 nm. Not only was the success of the grafting process ascertained but also the tubular nature of the used halloysite sample as seen on the SEM micrographs. The significant increase in the d value of the modified clay (H-polyQ22) suggested interlayer grafting. FTIR results showed that grafting was through OH groups, certainly interlayer, lumen and edge aluminol groups as well as defect site silanol groups. The electron transfer enhancing properties of the prepared polyelectrolyte were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The charge transfer resistance dropped significantly when H-polyQ22 was used as electrode modifier. The electrocatalytic behaviour of the H-polyQ22 modified electrode was further investigated using [Fe (CN)6]3− as anionic target. The halloysite polymer nanocomposite proved to be a good candidate for electrocatalysis.",Applied Clay Science

Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Heterostructures derived from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with multicomponent synergism are significant in the energy conversion and catalysis reactions. Herein, we demonstrated such an efficient catalyst with the structure of self-catalyzed nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube interconnected FeNi/FeF2 derived from hetero-zeolite imidazolate frameworks 8 (ZIF-8) on Fe2Ni MIL (MIL represents Materials of Institut Lavoisier) for oxygen evolution reaction. The obtained catalyst showed efficient synergism of the multicomponents, high polarity, more active sites exposure, increased intrinsic activity, and improved conductivity and stability by a carbon interconnected and confined structure as revealed by the spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical measurements. It required an overpotential of only ca. 240 mV (no iR correction) to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 in a KOH solution when loaded on an inert glass carbon electrode, much better than similar kinds of catalysts. The improved catalytic performance can be well correlated to the structural transformation step by step from different MOFs to their derivatives by subsequent carbonation and fluorination. Because of the above-mentioned structural advantages, good catalysis performance of high activity and stability, faster catalytic kinetics, and facile active phase formation were observed compared to those of other similar materials.

Electrospun La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.875Zn0.125O3-δ nano-powders as a single-phase cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The electrospinning technique was employed to prepare the La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.875Zn0.125O3-δ (LSMZn) cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H–SOFCs). Although the fiber structure can be obtained with the electrospinning technique for the LSMZn precursor, the fiber structure disappeared after the calcination procedure, leading to the formation of fine LSMZn nano-powders. It was found that the electrospun LSMZn can reach a pure phase after firing at 1100 °C, whereas the traditional sol-gel prepared LSMZn required a calcination temperature of 1150 °C. Furthermore, the electrospun LSMZn had a smaller particle size and richer oxygen vacancy than the traditional sol-gel LSMZn. First-principles calculations indicated that the oxygen vacancy-rich surface promoted the cathode reaction. The H–SOFC using the single-phase electrospun LSMZn generated a power density of 1122 mW cm−2 at 700 °C. The performance was not only larger than the sol-gel LSMZn cell reported in this study but also larger than previous H–SOFCs using the single-phase Mn-based cathodes, suggesting the electrospinning technique was an effective method to produce high-performing cathodes for H–SOFCs.",Ceramics International

Atomically dispersed metal catalysts confined by covalent organic frameworks and their derivatives for electrochemical energy conversion and storage,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs), a kind of metal species in the form of isolated atoms, have already become a new research front in heterogeneous catalysis. Generally, ADMCs are confined on supports, offering a better opportunity to optimize the catalytic performance via making use of metal-support interface interaction. Moreover, the electronic state and coordination structure of ADMCs can be regulated by the coordinated atoms from supports, thereby affecting the interaction between catalysts and substrates. Hence, the support plays a decisive role in the coordination structure, thereby determining the catalytic performance. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit enormous potential for confining ADMCs, featuring the outstanding properties of predictable structure, adjustable pore size, and tailored functionality. Here, this review not only elaborates the advantages and features of COFs for confining ADMCs, but also highlights the design strategies of COFs and derivatives confined ADMCs.

Subsequently, the product was used to adsorb low-concentration methyl mercaptan. Based on sorption experiments and molecular simulations, the underlying mechanism of the adsorption effect of the adsorbent's pore structure and surface oxygen- and nitrogen-containing functional groups on methyl mercaptan molecules were discussed. The results indicated that when the methyl mercaptan equilibrium concentration was 0.197 mg/L, the adsorption capacity of SUAC-16-2 for methyl mercaptan was 78.16 mg/g. Its adsorption performance was better than that of its previously reported counterparts. The well-developed microporous structure of SUAC-16-2 promoted the adsorption of methyl mercaptan. In addition, methyl mercaptan molecules could be broken down to produce CH3S− and H+ by the effect of the surface functional groups. Adjacent carbon atoms containing nitrogen and oxygen functional groups could better adsorb CH3S− and H+, and further strengthen the methyl mercaptan adsorption performance of activated carbon. The study could help to develop new technology for treatment of low concentration of methyl mercaptan in the air.",Chemosphere
Template-based textural modifications of polymeric graphitic carbon nitrides towards waste water treatment,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe composite materials based on graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) are remarkably better semiconductors, but the inherent photocatalytic performance in its generic synthesis form is not up to the mark. Eminence efforts have been made to improve its performance and photocatalytic efficiencies. Recently, extensive investigations have been performed to develop their texturally modified and highly porous structures to get around the big flaws of bulk g-C3N4. One significant disadvantage is the increase in the polycondensation while preparation at 550 °C results in g-C3N4 materials with restricted specific surface area (SSA) (<10 m2/g) and no textured pores. Textural modification has emerged as an efficient and progressive way to improve optical and electronic characteristics. The final texture and shape of CN are influenced by the precursor's interaction with the template. Researchers are interested in developing CN materials with high SSA and changeable textural properties (pore volume and pore size). Based on the literature review it is concluded that the soft templating approach is relatively simple, and straightforward to induce textural changes in the g-CN type materials. This review focused on improving the textural properties of bulk g-C3N4 via templating method, and the major advances in the modified g-C3N4 materials for the treatment of wastewater. The procedures and mechanisms of numerous approaches with varying morphologies are thoroughly explained.",Chemosphere
In-situ fabrication of dense structure nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube embedded Co/Co2P accelerating the electrochemical kinetics of lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Accelerating the sluggish electrochemical kinetics of polysulfide conversion using electrocatalysis is an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery. A rational catalyst needs to maximize its ability to capture and catalyze the polysulfide. Herein, we report a novel catalyst that exhibits a network structure of dense nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (CNT) embedded with Co/Co2P. The dense nitrogen-doped CNT plays the role of “tentacles” to capture and confine the polysulfide via physical and chemical interactions, and the embedded Co/Co2P that wrapped by the dense CNT acts as an electrocatalyst to catalyze the sulfur redox. As a result, the Li-S battery using Co/Co2P@N-CNT modified separator can deliver a capacity of 1405 mAh g−1 at 0.1C. It can also maintain a capacity of 647 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles, with a very low decay rate of 0.07% per cycle at 1C. Importantly, a high reversible areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm−2 can be obtained over 60 cycles, even under a raised sulfur content of 4.8 mg cm−2. This work provides a deep understanding of the architecture design of a highly efficient electrocatalyst for high-performance Li-S battery.",Applied Surface Science
Design and self-catalytic mechanism of aluminum precursors bearing amino ligands for Al2S3 atomic layer deposition,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.As a unique nanotechnology, atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been extensively used for the preparation of various nanomaterials. An effective precursor is a prerequisite to ALD success. Herein, we designed and introduced alkyl, hydrogen, halide, alkoxy and amino ligands to aluminum precursors and investigated reaction mechanisms of Al2S3 ALD through density functional calculations. The results show that aluminum precursors with alkyl, hydrogen and halide ligands are kinetically disadvantageous and with alkoxy groups are thermodynamically unfavorable and Al precursors bearing amino groups are thermodynamically and kinetically favorable for Al2S3 ALD. The activity of trimethylaluminum (TMA) on the sulfydrylated surface is lower than that on the hydroxylated surface. The reaction barriers of the aluminum precursors bearing amino ligands on the sulfydrylated surface are obviously lower than that of TMA. Similarly, the barrier of the H2S reaction on the aminated surface is much lower than that on the methylated surface. All of the amino groups have a self-catalytic role and accelerate the reaction of Al2S3 ALD. These insights into aluminum precursors bearing amino ligands for Al2S3 ALD can provide theoretical guidance for the discovery of new precursors and the ALD preparation of other aluminum and sulfur compounds.",Applied Surface Science
Bifunctional binder enables controllable deposition of polysulfides for high-loading Li-S battery,"© 2022Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery are regarded as a strong candidate for the next generation of high-performance battery due to its ultra-high capacity and low cost. However, severe shuttle effect of polysulfides (LiPSs) and the random deposition of lithium sulfide (Li2S) are vital challenges that impede the popularization of Li-S chemistry. Herein, inspired by charge-coordination interaction, a novel lithiophilic and sulfiphilic bifunctional polymer (LSBP) synthesized by in situ dynamic cross-linked is proposed to anchor LiPSs and enable controllable deposition of Li2S. The LSBP binder significantly improves the conversion reaction activity of LiPSs while the co-existence of lithiophilic (–COO-, -SO3-) and sulfiphilic (–NH2) sites effectively suppresses the shuttle of LiPSs, which is confirmed by in-situ time-resolved ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) measurement. As a result, a high-loading (3.5 mgcm−2) and crack-free sulfur-based cathode with LSBP binder is achieved. Besides its stable cycling performance, the cathode exhibits an outstanding rate capacity under a high rate of 2.5C. This work proposes a scalable strategy to obtain practicable Li-S battery through the improvement in binder, which is inherently low-cost and environmentally friendly.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Three-dimensional ordered mesoporous Co3O4/peroxymonosulfate triggered nanoconfined heterogeneous catalysis for rapid removal of ranitidine in aqueous solution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-induced advanced oxidation processes hold great promise for the in-depth treatment of many challenging pollutants. Herein, three-dimensional ordered mesoporous Co3O4 (3D OM-Co3O4) was synthesized with a KIT-6 template to boost PMS activation for the rapid removal of a target pollutant of ranitidine (RAN). At the optimal conditions, 3D OM-Co3O4 achieved the RAN removal efficiency of 99.2% and the RAN mineralization efficiency of 63.7% within 7 min. PMS activation by 3D OM-Co3O4 involved simultaneous non-radical and radical pathways, with the latter accounting for 73.2% of the total RAN removal efficiency. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that compared with Co3O4 nanoparticles, the adsorption energy of PMS molecules bonded to 3D OM-Co3O4 was increased from −0.213 eV to −0.297 eV due to its ordered mesoporous structure. The regeneration of 3D OM-Co3O4 by a reduction treatment indicated that its catalytic stability was associated with rapid charge transfer between the Co(III)/Co(II) redox couple. The possible degradation pathways revealed the oxidation behavior of RAN in the 3D OM-Co3O4/PMS heterogeneous system. This study provides a new perspective for the mechanism of PMS-induced heterogeneous catalytic oxidation and a novel method for enhancing the synergistic effect between Co3O4 nanoparticles.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Improving the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries by interface modification with a bifunctional electrolyte additive,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with sulfur cathode and lithium anode are considered as a promising candidate in the next generation of high specific energy secondary batteries. However, the scalable application of Li-S batteries is limited by the unstable electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Herein, a novel bifunctional electrolyte additive, trifluoromethane sulfonamide (TFMSA), is introduced to stabilize both electrode/electrolyte interfaces to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. The TFMSA molecule can not only alleviate the passivation of the sulfur cathode surface, but also suppress Li dendrites growth and prevent the lithium anode from the corrosion of polysulfides. As a result, the assembled Li-S battery with TFMSA-containing electrolyte displays excellent long-cycle performance and rate capability. Moreover, the Li||Li symmetric cell using TFMSA electrolyte can stably cycle for 1200 h at 1 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2. The Li-S pouch cell with TFMSA also exhibits outstanding performance, indicating the prospect of practical application. This work sheds light on an innovative idea for interface modification via an electrolyte additive to overcome the inherent issues of Li-S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
NiS/MoS2 Mott-Schottky heterojunction-induced local charge redistribution for high-efficiency urea-assisted energy-saving hydrogen production,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Urea-assisted water electrolysis possesses the prospective prospect for high-efficiency hydrogen production by replacing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with thermodynamically more favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Modulating the electronic structure of electrocatalysts through constructing metal–semiconductor heterointerface represents an effective strategy to promote the electrochemical performances. Herein, we construct a Mott-Schottky bifunctional electrocatalyst by in-situ growth of NiS/MoS2 hetero-nanoflowers on the conductive carbon cloth (CC) substrate (abbreviated as NiS/MoS2@CC hereafter) for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Thanks to the Mott-Schottky effect, the self-driven charge transfer occurs across the NiS/MoS2 heterointerfaces, which results in the built-in electric field, the accelerated charge transfer rate, and the modified chemisorption free energies for reaction intermediates, ultimately expediting the dissociation of water and urea molecules. Consequently, the as-fabricated NiS/MoS2@CC electrode only requires an overpotential of 87 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 M KOH and a potential of 1.36 V for UOR in 1.0 M KOH solution with 0.5 M urea to attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Moreover, when served as the free-standing anode and cathode simultaneously, the NiS/MoS2@CC-assembled urea electrolyzer requires a cell voltage of 1.46 V at 10 mA cm−2, which is 200 mV smaller than that of the pure water splitting counterpart. This study may deepen the understanding of electronic modulation via Mott-Schottky establishment.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Well entrapped platinum-iron nanoparticles on three-dimensional nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon as highly efficient and durable catalyst for oxygen reduction and zinc-air battery,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The high-performance and durable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst on air cathode is a key component in assembly of Zn-air batteries. Herein, three-dimensional N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (3D N-OMC) was first prepared with silica as a template via pyrolysis with assistance of dicyandiamide as a N-doping agent, combined by full adsorption of platinum (II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) and iron (II) phthalocyanine (FePc) via π-π interactions. After further pyrolysis of the resulting mixture, many PtFe nanoparticles were efficiently incorporated in 3D N-OMC (termed as PtFe@3D N-OMC for simplicity). Control experiments were certificated the important role of the pyrolysis temperature played in this synthesis. The resultant composite synergistically combines advantages of hierarchically accessible surfaces, highly open structure, and well-dispersed PtFe particles, which endow the PtFe@3D N-OMC with onset and half-wave potentials of 0.98 and 0.86 V in alkaline media, respectively, showing appealing catalytic activity for the ORR. Most significantly, the PtFe@3D N-OMC based Zn-air battery has a high power density of 80.57 mW cm−2 and long-term durability (220 h, 660 cycles). This work opens a new avenue for design of high-efficiency and durable ORR electrocatalysts in energy conversion and storage systems.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Synergistic coupling of heterostructured porous CoP nanosheets with P doped NiO for highly efficient overall alkaline water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Exploring non-noble metal materials as bifunctional catalysts for water electrolysis is of great significance for the development and utilization of hydrogen energy. Herein, a flower branch-leaf shaped phosphide/oxide heterogeneous electrocatalyst located on Ni foam (CoP/P-NiO/NF) was developed through hydrothermal and phosphorization strategy. Benefiting from the strong ability to dissociate H2O molecules on P-NiO and the suitable adsorption of intermediate H species on CoP, the optimal CoP/P-NiO/NF exhibited outstanding performance with low overpotentials of 52 mV at current density of 10 mA cm−2, smaller Tafel slopes of 73.6 mV dec-1 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, CoP/P-NiO/NF indicated 265 mV at 100 mA cm−2 with Tafel slope of 101.8 mV dec-1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the optimal redistribution of electrons among Ni2+, Co2+ and Co3+ for favorable adsorption/desorption of oxygen-intermediates. Both HER and OER shown robust stability during 32 h without decline. The corresponding two-electrode system for overall alkaline water splitting required a low voltage of 1.6 V at 100 mA cm−2 with long stability (20 h) which is far lower than that on RuO2-Pt/C and many other reported non-noble metal electrocatalysts. This work demonstrates that the synergistic effect and morphology engineering play vital roles in the enhanced electrocatalytic performance.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Nanoscale interface engineering of inorganic Solid-State electrolytes for High-Performance alkali metal batteries,"© 2022All-solid-state metal batteries (ASSMBs) have been regarded as the ideal candidate for the next-generation high-energy storage system due to their ultrahigh specific capacity and the lowest redox potential. However, the uncontrollable chemical reactivity during cycling which directly determines the growth behaviour of metal dendrites, the low coulombic efficiency and the safety concerns severely limit their real-world applications. Crystallographic optimization based on solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) provides an atomic-scale and fundamental solution for the inhibition of dendrite growth in metal anodes, which has attracted widespread attentions. From this perspective, we summarize the recent advance of the crystallographic optimization for various classes of solid-state electrolytes.

A Ni/Ni2P heterostructure in modified porous carbon separator for boosting polysulfide catalytic conversion Ni/Ni2P异质结/多孔碳修饰隔膜用于加速多硫化物催化转化,"© 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The intrinsic sluggish conversion kinetics and severe shuttle effect in lithium—sulfur (Li-S) batteries are responsible for their poor reversible capacity and cycling longevity, which have greatly hindered their practical applications. To address these drawbacks, herein, we design and construct a heterostructured Ni/Ni2P embedded in a mesoporous carbon nanosphere composite (Ni/Ni2P-MCN) for boosting polysulfide catalytic conversion in Li-S batteries. The Ni/Ni2P-MCN-modified separator could not only prevent the shuttle effect significantly through abundant chemical adsorptive sites, but also demonstrate superior catalytic reactivities for the conversion of polysulfides. More importantly, the conductive carbon matrix with an exposed mesoporous structure can serve as an effective physical barrier to accommodate deposited insoluble Li2S. Consequently, the cells with the Ni/Ni2P-MCN-modified separator exhibit greatly boosted rate capability (431 mA h g−1 at 5 C) and cycling stability (a capacity decay of 0.031% per cycle after 1500 cycles). Even at an enhanced sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm−2, a stable and superior areal capacity (about 3.5 mA h cm−2) has been demonstrated. We envision that the unique Ni/Ni2P heterostructure in the porous carbon matrix could offer great potential for high-performance and sustained energy storage devices.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Science China Materials
Advances in Atomic Layer Deposition,"© 2022, The Author(s).Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a thin-film fabrication technique that has great potential in nanofabrication. Based on its self-limiting surface reactions, ALD has excellent conformality, sub-nanometer thickness control, and good process compatibility.

This article provides an introduction to ALD and highlights its applications in semiconductors, pan-semiconductors, environment and energy, and other fields. The applications of ALD in the key nodes of integrated circuits are initially demonstrated, and the area-selective ALD technique is discussed as a bottom-up method for self-aligned nanomanufacturing. Emerging applications of ALD are illustrated in the fabrication of passivation layers, functional surface layers, and buffer layers, which have shown the development trend of ALD in miniaturization and diversification. ALD is an enabling technique for atomic and close-to-atomic scale manufacturing (ACSM) of materials, structures, devices, and systems in versatile applications.

Hydrothermally synthesized N and S co-doped mesoporous carbon microspheres from poplar powder for supercapacitors with enhanced performance,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.The N and S co-doped mesoporous carbon microspheres are prepared using poplar powder as a carbon source and L-cysteine as nitrogen and sulfur co-precursors via a hydrothermal process, carbonization in a tube furnace, and the removal of silica template. The as-prepared mesoporous carbon microspheres exhibit globular carbon with a variety of sizes and relatively high specific surface areas of 88.46 m2g−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses reveal that the surfaces of mesoporous carbon microspheres are rich in various functional groups that contain nitrogen and sulfur. The capacitance performances of the N and S co-doped mesoporous carbon microspheres were tested using an electrochemical workstation. At a current density of 1 Ag−1, the specific capacitance of the mesoporous carbon microspheres reaches 173.66 Fg−1, which is 42.9% higher than that of the reference group. This is because co-doping with N and S reduces internal resistance of the material. Meanwhile, the diffusion impedance of the materials is reduced because of the formed pores with an increased specific area. Overall, these findings open new opportunities in the field of energy storage for the synthesis of well-developed, poplar wood carbonaceous material that has relatively high surface area and is rich in nitrogen and sulfur.

Theoretical and Experimental Understanding of Metal Single-Atom Electrocatalysts for Accelerating the Electrochemical Reaction of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Metal single-atom materials have attracted tremendous attention in the research field of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries because they can effectively improve the reaction kinetics of sulfur cathodes. However, it is still difficult to determine the best metal single-atom catalyst for Li-S batteries, due to the lack of a unified measurement and evaluation method. Herein, a series of metal single-atom- A nd nitrogen-doped graphene materials (M-NG, M = Fe, Co, Ni, Ir, Ru) have been prepared as the catalysts for promoting the reaction kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction process. Using rotating disk electrode measurements and density functional theory-based theoretical calculations, Ni-NG was screened out to be the best catalyst. It is found that Ni-NG materials can provide a kinetically favorable pathway for the reversible conversion of polysulfide conversion, thus increasing the utilization of sulfur. By coating the Ni-NG materials on the separator as a multifunctional interlayer, a commercially available sulfur cathode presents a stable specific capacity of 701.8 mAh g-1 at a current rate of 0.5C over 400 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading of 3.8 mg cm-2, a high areal capacity of 4.58 mAh cm-2 can be achieved.

Built-In Electric Field on the Mott-Schottky Heterointerface-Enabled Fast Kinetics Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries (LSBs) have been considered one of the most potential candidates to substitute traditional Li-ion batteries (LIBs), owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. Nevertheless, the shuttle effect and the sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) have long been obstacles to realizing stable LSBs with high reversible capacity. In this study, we proposed a metal-semiconductor (Mo and MoO2) heterostructure with the hollow microsphere morphology as an effective Mott-Schottky electrocatalyst to boost sulfur electrochemistry. The hollow structure can physically inhibit the shuttling of LiPSs and accommodate the volume fluctuation during cycling. More importantly, the built-in electric field at the heterointerfacial sites can effectively accelerate the reduction of LiPSs and oxidation of Li2S, thereby reaching a high sulfur utilization. With the assistance of the Mo/MoO2 catalyst, the cell exhibited prominent rate capability and stable long-term cycling performance, showing a high capacity of 630 mA h·g-1 at 4 C and a low decay of 0.073% at 1 C after 500 cycles. Even with high areal sulfur loading of 10.0 mg·cm-2, high capacity and good cycle stability were achieved at 0.2 C under lean electrolyte conditions (E/S ratio of 6 μL·mg-1).",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Herein, we report a Cu-based composite material comprising of g-C3N4, MoS2, and copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) for more efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction. The g-C3N4/MoS2 is used as a support for Cu NPs as part of the novel composite structure (Cu-g-C3N4/MoS2). The material exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity because of synergistic effect arises from their components. The material also demonstrated higher efficiency in the CO2 reduction compared to other composites such as Cu NPs supported on g-C3N4 (i.e., Cu-g-C3N4) and MoS2 (i.e., Cu-MoS2) with reference to superior current density and potential. The synthesized Cu-g-C3N4/MoS2 composite material demonstrated the highest faradaic efficiency of 19.7% and 4.8% for methanol and ethanol, respectively.

In addition, the highly reversible conversion of discharge product also plays a vital role in prolonging the cycling life of conversion type anode materials for Li/Na-ion batteries. In this work, a composite of isolated ultrafine Fe3N nanocrystals (<15 nm) strongly coupled with N doped 3D porous carbon networks (N-3DPCN) were successfully fabricated via salt template-assisted calcination strategy. Both experimental results and theoretical simulations have validated that the powerful interface interaction between ultrafine Fe3N nanocrystals (<15 nm) and N-3DPCN is bound up with the N-doping in 3DPCN, and the atomically dispersed metal Fe in the N-3DPCN (SAFe-N@3DPCN) formed during the discharge process of Fe3N can catalyze the reversible conversion of discharge product Na3N.

Here, we report an approach to fabricate the Ganoderma Lucidum waste-derived erythrocyte-like N, O self-doped porous biomass carbon (GL800) with a high graphitization degree by a facile carbonization and activation method. The prepared GL800 showed a relatively high specific surface area (2407.5 m2 g−1) and a porous structure like the red blood cell, which affords enough space to accommodate active sites and are easy for electrolytes to infiltrate. Due to the synergistic effect of the rich N, O self-doped elements and porous structures, GL800 shows strong chemical adsorption and physical confinement for polysulfide.

Constructing ohmic contact on hollow carbon nanocages to enhance conduction loss enabling high-eﬃcient microwave absorption,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMetal organic frameworks (MOFs) derived carbon materials have attracted much attention as hopeful electromagnetic microwave absorbents. However, the poor impedance matching and high filler content severely limited its electromagnetic absorption application. The introduction of hollow structural engineering is beneficial to improving microwave absorption performance. Herein, we designed and constructed Ni-incorporated hollow N-doped carbon nanocages (Ni/NCNs) to reveal interfacial charge transfer in electromagnetic wave attenuation. The hollow carbon structure facilitates impedance matching, highly dispersive Ni nanoparticles not only build a dense magnetic coupling network but also generate a series of Ohmic contact heterogeneous interfaces with hollow NCNs, extremely accelerating the charge transfer and enhancing conduction loss. Thanks to hollow structure, optimized impedance matching, and abundant Ohmic contact heterogeneous interfaces, the Ni50/NCNs exhibit a minimum reflection loss of −57.3 dB. The results demonstrate that Ni50/NCNs composites have great potential to be considered efficient electromagnetic wave materials, and the designed Ohmic contact heterogeneous interfaces pave the way in the study of electromagnetic wave absorption mechanisms.",Carbon
Theoretical probing the anchoring properties of BNP2 monolayer for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is blocked to implement as a practical energy storage device ascribes to the shuttle effect during charging and discharging processes. To solve the shuttle effect problem, one feasible method is to design a suitable anchoring material on the electrode. In this study, we explore the potential application of the BNP2 monolayer as an anchoring material through the first-principles calculation method. The results show that BNP2 with adequate adsorption energies (from 0.71 eV to 3.60 eV) can inhibit the shuttle effect without causing lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) decomposition. Then, by analyzing the projected density of states, it can be found that the property of BNP2 has been changed from a semiconductor to metal after adsorbing LiPSs, which is conducive to improving the electrical conductivity of the system. Moreover, due to the low cleavage energy barrier for the conversion of Li2S2 into Li2S, it not only improves the conversion efficiency but also avoids the waste of active substances. Finally, the low energy barrier for the catalytic decomposition of Li2S and the fast diffusion of the Li atom on the substrate accelerates the entire electrochemical process, thereby promoting the cycle performance and coulombic efficiency of Li-S batteries. In view of these advantages, it could expect that the BNP2 monolayer is an excellent anchoring material for Li-S batteries.",Applied Surface Science

In this study, a novel two-step solvothermal method was designed to synthesize reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-modified bismuth oxyhalide (BiOX, X = Cl, I, Br) nanosheets. The modification of rGO led to the significant enhancement in the specific surface area of BiOX nanosheets, reduction in the bandgap, improvements in the light absorption range and intensity, acceleration in the photogenerated carrier separation rate, and reduction in the photogenerated electron − hole complexation. Furthermore, both [rad]O2– and [rad]OH were demonstrated to be active species in the reaction. Owing to these achievements, all samples displayed significantly improved photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the rGO-modified samples exhibited excellent stability and maintained the highest mercury removal efficiency after several cycles. However, the samples prepared in this research displayed a high level of moisture resistance. These characteristics of BiOX-based materials make them potential candidates for the photocatalytic removal of heavy metals from industrial waste gases.",Applied Surface Science
Dithiophosphonate Anchored Heterometallic (Ag(I)/Fe(II)) Molecular Catalysts for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The dichalcogenide ligated molecules in catalysis to produce molecular hydrogen through electroreduction of water are rarely explored. Here, a series of heterometallic [Ag4(S2PFc(OR)4] [where Fc = Fe(η5-C5H4)(η5-C5H5), R = Me, 1; Et, 2; nPr, 3; isoAmyl, 4] clusters were synthesized and characterized by IR, absorption spectroscopy, NMR (1H, 31P), and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The molecular structures of 1, 2, and 3 clusters were established by single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis. The structural elucidation shows that each triangular face of a tetrahedral silver(I) core is capped by a ferrocenyl dithiophosphonate ligand in a trimetallic triconnective (η3 μ2, μ1) pattern. A comparative electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction of 1-5 (R = iPr, 5) was studied in order to demonstrate the potential of these clusters in water splitting activity. The experimental results reveal that catalytic performance decreases with increases in the length of the carbon chain and branching within the alkoxy (-OR) group of these clusters. Catalytic durability was found effective even after 8 h of a chronoamperometric stability test along with 1500 cycles of linear sweep voltammetry performance, and only 15 mV overpotential was increased at 5 mA/cm2 current density for cluster 1. A catalytic mechanism was proposed by applying density functional theory (DFT) on clusters 1 and 2 as a representative. Here, a μ1 coordinated S-site between Ag4 core and ligand was found a reaction center. The experimental results are also in good accordance with the DFT analysis.",Inorganic Chemistry

l-Lysine derived fabrication of Cu@Ni core-satellite nanoassemblies as efficient non-Pt catalysts for the methanol oxidation reaction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Designing cost-effective, highly active, and durable noble-metal-free electrocatalysts as alternative electrode materials for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is of significant importance for practical applications. Herein, we report a facile one-pot synthetic route to construct Cu@Ni core-satellite nanoassemblies (CS-NAs) with the assistance of eco-friendly l-lysine, which involves the spontaneous process of preferential formation of the Cu core followed by self-assembly growth of Ni satellites. The selection of the Cu core is beneficial for enhancing the charge transfer and tuning the electronic structure of Ni satellites, as well as serving as a self-skeleton to enhance the structural stability for catalysis. Meanwhile, the tiny Ni satellites could be fully exposed, which not only produce a larger number of valid active sites, but also provide a short electron and ion transport distance. As a result, the Cu@Ni CS-NAs are qualified as superior and durable electrocatalysts for the MOR, affording 29.6 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V with long-term chronoamperometric stability.",CrystEngComm
Nanoporous Nitrogen-Doped Ti3C2Nanosheets as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.MXene (e.g., Ti3C2), a group of two-dimensional materials with high electrical conductivity, high specific surface area, and excellent mechanical properties, have been widely used in energy storage and conversion devices. Herein, nitrogen-doped Ti3C2 nanosheets with porous structures are simply prepared by etching Ti3C2 nanosheets in ammonia solution. Under alkaline conditions, the surface of the Ti3C2 nanosheets is attacked by hydroxyl ions, breaking Ti-C bonds and forming a porous structure. Meanwhile, the Ti3C2 nanosheets are doped by nitrogen atoms during ammonia etching. The porous structure of the Ti3C2 nanosheets is beneficial to the adsorption and transfer of oxygen and supplies active edge sites for oxygen reduction. In addition, the nitrogen doping enhances the catalytic activity of the Ti3C2 nanosheets. Therefore, the porous nitrogen-doped Ti3C2 nanosheets exhibit highly improved electrocatalytic oxygen reduction activity and superior stability.

Fe Single-Atom Electrochemical Sensors for H2O2Produced by Living Cells,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Reasonable sensor construction for precisely real-time detecting H2O2 produced from living cells has always been of great significance and challenges. Due to the excellent catalytic efficiency and unparalleled peroxidase-like activity, single-atomic catalysts with Fe-Nx active sites show great potential in H2O2 detection. These special atomic active sites make it easier for the Fenton reaction to occur, which provides basic support for H2O2 sensors. Their application in the in situ real-time detection of H2O2 has important market prospects. Herein, single-atomic Fe catalysts with distorted graphitic carbon are obtained through a simpler preparation method. A precursor hemin@zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (hemin@ZIF-8) is calcined at a high temperature and carbonized to get the nitrogen-carbon codoped Fe single atoms (Fe SAs-N/C) and then successfully prepare a H2O2 electrochemical sensor by modifying it on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Its peroxidase activity is calculated by enzymatic kinetics, which shows a better peroxidase activity compared with horseradish peroxidase and other reported single-atom (SA) materials. Moreover, the electrocatalytic kinetics is explained by Laviron calculation, which more directly confirms that it has a faster electron transfer rate. Importantly, Fe SAs-N/C@GCE has a wider linear range than sensors combined with other SA materials and a low detection limit of 0.34 μM. It is an attractive design of H2O2 sensors and single-atomic catalysts with superior substrate affinity that are novel alternatives to natural enzymes.",ACS Applied Nano Materials
Steering Catalytic Activity and Selectivity of CO2 Photoreduction to Syngas with Hydroxy-Rich Cu2S@ROH-NiCo2O3 Double-Shelled Nanoboxes,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Simultaneous transformation of CO2 and H2O into syngas (CO and H2) using solar power is desirable for industrial applications. Herein, an efficient photocatalyst based on double-shelled nanoboxes, with an outer shell of hydroxy-rich nickel cobaltite nanosheets and an inner shell of Cu2S (Cu2S@ROH-NiCo2O3), is prepared via a multistep templating strategy. The high performance of Cu2S@ROH-NiCo2O3 (7.1 mmol g−1 h−1 for CO; 2.8 mmol g−1 h−1 for H2) is attributed to the hierarchical hollow geometry and p–n heterojunction to promote light absorption and charge separation. Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses elucidate that the ROH-NiCo2O3 surface enhances *CO2 adsorption and lowers energy barriers for CO2-to-CO. Therefore, modulating the hydroxy contents of ROH-NiCo2O3 can achieve broad CO/H2 ratios from 0.51 to 1.24. This work offers in-depth insights into adjustable syngas photosynthesis and generalized concepts of selective heterogeneous CO2 photoreduction beyond cobalt-based oxides.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Post-synthetically modified metal-porphyrin framework GaTCPP for carbon dioxide adsorption and energy storage in Li-S batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulphur batteries attract increasing interest due to their high theoretical specific capacity, advantageous economy, and “eco-friendliness”. In this study, a metal-organic framework (MOF) GaTCPP containing a porphyrinic base ligand was used as a conductive additive for sulphur. GaTCPP was synthesized, characterized, and post-synthetically modified by the transition metal ions (Co2+/Ni2+). The doping of GaTCPP ensured an increase in the carbon dioxide adsorption capacities, which were measured under different conditions. Post-synthetic modification of GaTCPP with Co2+/Ni2+ ions has been shown to increase carbon dioxide storage capacity from 22.8 wt% for unmodified material to 23.1 wt% and 26.5 wt% at 0 °C and 1 bar for Co2+ and Ni2+-doped analogues, respectively. As a conductive part of cathode material, MOFs displayed successful sulphur capture and encapsulation proven by stable charge/discharge cycle performances, high-capacity retention, and coulombic efficiency. The electrodes with pristine GaTCPP showed a discharge capacity of 699 mA h g−1 at 0.2C in the fiftieth cycle. However, the doping of GaTCPP by Ni2+ has a positive impact on the electrochemical properties, the capacity increased to 778 mA h g−1 in the fiftieth cycle at 0.2C.",RSC Advances
Metal Ion Cutting-Assisted Synthesis of Defect-Rich MoS2Nanosheets for High-Rate and Ultrastable Li2S Catalytic Deposition,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Active metal ions often show a strong cutting effect on the chemical bonds during higherature thermal processes. Herein, a one-pot metal ion cutting-assisted method was adopted to design defect-rich MoS2-xnanosheet (NS)/ZnS nanoparticle (NP) heterojunction composites on carbon nanofiber skeletons (CNF@MoS2-x/ZnS) via a simple Ar-ambience annealing. Results show that Zn2+ions capture S2-ions from MoS2and form into ZnS NPs, and the MoS2NSs lose S2-ions and become MoS2-xones. As sulfur hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs), the CNF@MoS2-x/ZnS-S cathodes deliver a high reversible capacity of 1233 mA h g-1at 0.1 C and keep 944 mA h g-1at 3 C. Moreover, the cathodes also show an extremely low decay rate of 0.012% for 900 cycles at 2 C. Series of analysis indicate that the MoS2-xNSs significantly improve the chemisorption and catalyze the kinetic process of redox reactions of lithium polysulfides, and the heterojunctions between MoS2-xNSs and ZnS NPs further accelerate the transport of electrons and the diffusion of Li+ions. Besides, the CNF@MoS2-x/ZnS-S LSBs also show an ultralow self-discharge rate of 1.1% in voltage. This research would give some new insights for the design of defect-rich electrode materials for high-performance energy storage devices.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Nanofibrous Cathode Catalysts with MoC Nanoparticles Embedded in N-Rich Carbon Shells for Low-Overpotential Li-CO2Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Li-CO2batteries with high theoretical energy densities are recognized as next-generation energy storage devices for addressing the range anxiety and environmental issues encountered in the field of electric transportation. However, cathode catalysts with unsatisfactory activity toward CO2absorption and reduction/evolution reactions hinder the development of Li-CO2batteries with desired specific capacities and sufficient cycle numbers. In this work, a multifunctional nanofibrous cathode catalyst that integrates N-rich carbon shells embedded with molybdenum carbide nanoparticles and multiwalled carbon nanotube cores was designed and prepared. The N-rich carbon shell could strengthen the absorption capacity of CO2and Li2CO3. The molybdenum carbide nanoparticles would improve the catalytic activity of both CO2reduction and evolution reactions. The carbon nanotube cores would provide an efficient network for electron transportation. The synergistic effect of the cathode catalysts enhances the electrochemical performance of Li-CO2batteries. A high cycling stability of more than 150 cycles at a current density of 250 mA g-1with a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g-1and a charge/discharge overpotential of less than 1.5 V is achieved. This work provides a feasible strategy for the design of a high-performance cathode catalyst for lithium-air batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Butterfly Effect of Electron Donor from Monoatomic Cobalt in Few-Atom Platinum Clusters: Boosting Electrocatalysis,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Few-atom metal clusters feature an extremely large surface area and abundant active sites, which are particularly important for electrocatalysis. Herein, we report a monoatomic cobalt tailoring strategy to boost the performance of platinum clusters (ca. <1 nm) via hetero-charge-trapping chemistry by ultraviolet light reducing Pt-based anions anchored on target Co cations. The created Co1Ptxclusters exhibit a mass activity of 2.27 A mgPt-1, which is about 1621% higher than that obtained by state-of-the-art Pt/C (2 nm) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This can be attributed to the butterfly effect of electron donor from monoatomic cobalt in the platinum clusters. Moreover, the improved stability results from the Co located at the bottom position of the Pt host, possessing high resistance to Co leaching. Therefore, this offers a general strategy to optimize the high performance of platinum group metal (PGM) clusters for electrocatalysis.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Efficient Adsorption of Acetylene over CO2in Bioinspired Covalent Organic Frameworks,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Rational design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to broaden their diversity is highly desirable but challenging due to the limited, expensive, and complex building blocks, especially compared with other easily available porous materials. In this work, we fabricated two novel bioinspired COFs, namely, NUS-71 and NUS-72, using reticular chemistry with ellagic acid and triboronic acid-based building blocks. Both COFs with AB stacking mode exhibit high acetylene (C2H2) adsorption capacity and excellent separation performance for C2H2/CO2 mixtures, which is significant but rarely explored using COFs. The impressive affinities for C2H2 appear to be related to the sandwich structure formed by C2H2 and the host framework via multiple host-guest interactions. This work not only represents a new avenue for the construction of low-cost COFs but also expands the variety of the COF family using natural biochemicals as building blocks for broad application.",Journal of the American Chemical Society

Suppressing Polysulfides Shuttling and Promoting Sulfur Utilization via Transition Metal and Nitrogen Co-Doping on Graphdiyne Cathodes of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: A First-Principles Modeling,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.While lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered the next-generation energy storage devices, several issues inhibit their commercialization, including poor conductivity, shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and sluggish decomposition of small LiPSs. Here, we illustrate through first-principles modeling that doping graphdiyne (GDY) with transition metal (Co, Fe) and nitrogen (TM-N) effectively suppresses the shuttle effect and enhances sulfur utilization by promoting dissociation of small LiPSs. We find that the TM-N doping provides additional electrons to the substrate, which could improve the redox activity of the substrates. The additional electrons also improve charge transfer between the substrate and adsorbate that enhances the LiPS adsorption. Electronic structure analysis reveals that the strong interactions originate from the formation of TM-S bonds and electrostatic attractions between Li and N. Such strong adsorptions prevail in the interaction between the LiPSs and electrolyte molecules; hence, the doped GDY could effectively prevent the dissolution of LiPSs and inhibit the shuttle effect. Moreover, the doped GDY substrates exhibit small barriers of Li-S and Li-N bond breaking that facilitate the decomposition of small LiPSs. This implies that TM-N-doped GDY promotes kinetics of LiPS transformation, which increases sulfur utilization and diminishes capacity fading upon charge-discharge cycles. From the computational viewpoints, the TM-N-doped GDY substrates are considered promising cathodes of Li-S batteries. This work serves as a useful guide to rationally design high-performance two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based cathode materials for Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Homogeneous Organometallic Catalysts for Improved Electrochemical Kinetics of Li-S Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The dissolution of polysulfides into electrolytes and sluggish electrochemical conversion kinetics primarily impede the practical realization of Li-S batteries. Homogeneous catalysis is an effective strategy to overcome the challenges involved under lean electrolyte conditions. Metallocenes, a class of organometallic compounds, hold promise to anchor and catalyze polysulfides. In this study, we used first-principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations to understand the role of metallocenes (using titanocene (TiCp2) as an archetypical example) as homogeneous catalysts in the electrolyte medium to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the reaction kinetics. The calculated electrochemical stability window of TiCp2reveals that the composition is electrochemically inactive in the operating potential range of Li-S batteries and can thus be leveraged as an additive to expedite the reduction kinetics of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). We studied the detailed characteristic behavior of LiPS interactions with TiCp2in both gas and solvent phases and the kinetics of elementary sulfur reduction reactions (SRRs). We found that TiCp2provides adequate binding toward various LiPSs to mitigate the shuttle effect, and the structural integrity of LiPSs is well retained without any chemical decomposition. The catalyzing effect of TiCp2is evident from the observed significant reduction in the SRR barriers, particularly for the rate-determining step, which is expected to favorably promote the deposition of Li2S on the cathode surface. We further propose a mechanistic scheme of TiCp2homogeneous catalyst-boosted sulfur redox cycles. Overall, our simulations predicted moderate binding and improved kinetics of polysulfide chemistry with the metallocene-based homogeneous catalyst and are expected to lead to a paradigm shift in the design of organometallic additives for achieving high-performance metal-sulfur batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials

Herein, Co3O4, Co9S8 catalysts and their heterostructure Co3O4/Co9S8 were synthesized and evaluated as water oxidation electrocatalysts. The characterization of Co3O4, Co9S8, and Co3O4/Co9S8 electrocatalysts was performed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques.

Efficient detection of glucose by graphene-based non-enzymatic sensing material based on carbon dot,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Diabetes is one of the global chronic diseases, which is mainly caused by the abnormal increase of blood sugar level. Therefore, it is particularly important to monitor glucose in real time. In this work, based on the principle that phenylboronic acid can react with diol rapidly and reversibly in aqueous medium, phenylboronic acid functionalized reduced graphene oxide (rGO-PBA) and polyhydroxy modified carbon spot fluorescent probe (CD1) were designed for detecting important glucose molecules. Among them, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has high specific surface area and strong fluorescence quenching performance. When CD1 is close to the surface of rGO-PBA, the fluorescence of carbon dots was quenched. With the addition of glucose, the fluorescence of carbon dots increased continuously.

Oxidized Nb2C MXene as catalysts for lithium-sulfur batteries: Mitigating the shuttle phenomenon by facilitating catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides,"© 2022Extensive research has been devoted to lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries due to their overwhelming promises and advantages such as high theoretical capacity (1675 mAh g−1), extremely cost effectiveness and abundance and availability of sulfur. Nevertheless, a sluggish electrochemical kinetics of the battery limited by a slow conversion of lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) intermediates and LiPSs shuttle effect severely hinder its development towards industrial application. Herein, we designed the oxidized Nb2C MXene with amorphous carbon (Nb2O5/C) composites as sulfur host using CO2 treatment to address the above issues. The Nb2O5/C composites with high conductivity are directly employed as sulfur hosts for Li-S battery capable to remarkably mitigate the shuttle phenomenon due to a combined effect of their LiPSs trapping ability and catalytic activity towards their accelerated conversion. Meanwhile, the unique layered structure of the composite facilitates ion transfer and accommodates the volume changes of the cathode during cycling.

However, serious volume changes during charging and discharging pose great challenges to their stability. In this work, petal-like MoS2/Co9S8/C nanohybrids were synthesized via the immobilization of molybdyl acetoacetonate MoO2(acac)2 in ZIF-67 and subsequent combined vulcanization and thermolysis process.

Herein, inspired by the salutary poly(vinyl ethylene carbonate) (PVEC) component in the solid electrolyte interphase, cross-linking vinyl ethylene carbonate and ionic liquid copolymers were synthesized by in-situ polymerization to serve as polymer electrolyte for LMBs. On one hand, due to rich ester bonds of PVEC, Li+ could transfer by coupling/decoupling with oxygen atoms. On the other hand, the imidazole ring of ionic liquid could facilitate the dissociation of lithium salt to promote the free movement of Li+. The bifunctional component synergistically increased the ionic conductivity of the SPE to 1.97×10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C. Meanwhile, it also showed a wide electrochemical window, superior mechanical properties, outstanding non-combustibility, and excellent interfacial compatibility.

A Lithium-Sulfur Battery Using Binder-Free Graphene-Coated Aluminum Current Collector,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur battery of practical interest requires thin-layer support to achieve acceptable volumetric energy density. However, the typical aluminum current collector of Li-ion battery cannot be efficiently used in the Li/S system due to the insulating nature of sulfur and a reaction mechanism involving electrodeposition of dissolved polysulfides. We study the electrochemical behavior of a Li/S battery using a carbon-coated Al current collector in which the low thickness, the high electronic conductivity, and, at the same time, the host ability for the reaction products are allowed by a binder-free few-layer graphene (FLG) substrate. The FLG enables a sulfur electrode having a thickness below 100 μm, fast kinetics, low impedance, and an initial capacity of 1000 mAh gS-1with over 70% retention after 300 cycles.

Regulating Lithium Salt to Inhibit Surface Gelation on an Electrocatalyst for High-Energy-Density Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have great potential as high-energy-density energy storage devices. Electrocatalysts are widely adopted to accelerate the cathodic sulfur redox kinetics. The interactions among the electrocatalysts, solvents, and lithium salts significantly determine the actual performance of working Li-S batteries. Herein, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), a commonly used lithium salt, is identified to aggravate surface gelation on the MoS2 electrocatalyst. In detail, the trifluoromethanesulfonyl group in LiTFSI interacts with the Lewis acidic sites on the MoS2 electrocatalyst to generate an electron-deficient center. The electron-deficient center with high Lewis acidity triggers cationic polymerization of the 1,3-dioxolane solvent and generates a surface gel layer that reduces the electrocatalytic activity. To address the above issue, Lewis basic salt lithium iodide (LiI) is introduced to block the interaction between LiTFSI and MoS2 and inhibit the surface gelation. Consequently, the Li-S batteries with the MoS2 electrocatalyst and the LiI additive realize an ultrahigh actual energy density of 416 W h kg-1 at the pouch cell level. This work affords an effective lithium salt to boost the electrocatalytic activity in practical working Li-S batteries and deepens the fundamental understanding of the interactions among electrocatalysts, solvents, and salts in energy storage systems.",Journal of the American Chemical Society
Highly Stable and Selective Sensing of Hydrogen Sulfide in Living Mouse Brain with NiN4Single-Atom Catalyst-Based Galvanic Redox Potentiometry,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is recognized as a gasotransmitter and multifunctional signaling molecule in the central nervous system. Despite its essential neurofunctions, the chemical dynamics of H2S during physiological and pathological processes remains poorly understood, emphasizing the significance of H2S sensor development. However, the broadly utilized electrochemical H2S sensors suffer from low stability and sensitivity loss in vivo due to sulfur poisoning-caused electrode passivation. Herein, we report a high-performance H2S sensor that combines single-atom catalyst strategy and galvanic redox potentiometry to overcome the issue. Atomically dispersed NiN4 active sites on the sensing interface promote electrochemical H2S oxidation at an extremely low potential to drive spontaneous bipolarization of a single carbon fiber. Bias-free potentiometric sensing at open-circuit condition minimizes sulfur accumulation on the electrode surface, thus significantly enhancing the stability and sensitivity. The resulting sensor displays high selectivity to H2S against physiological interferents and enables real-time accurate quantification of H2S-releasing behavior in the living mouse brain.",Journal of the American Chemical Society
In situ characterization of lithium-metal anodes,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.With the increasing demand for high energy density, traditional lithium-ion batteries with graphite anodes can no longer meet the requirements. Accordingly, due to its extremely high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mA h g−1) and most negative electrochemical potential (−3.04 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode), lithium metal has re-emerged as the focus of research. However, due to its instability, growth of Li-dendrites, and volume changes during charging and discharging, lithium metal anodes (LMAs) cause a reduction in the battery performance, hindering their commercial application. Therefore, it is necessary to study the reasons for the failure mechanism of lithium metal anodes. Due to the high reactivity of lithium metal and its sensitivity to air, conventional characterization needs to be performed after disassembling the battery, resulting in the inability to obtain dynamic information during the charging and discharging process. On the contrary, the emergence of in situ characterization not only can avoid sample contamination due to the disassembly of the battery but also realize real-time monitoring of lithium metal anodes. In this study, initially, we discuss the reasons for the failure of LMAs and the related theoretical models, and subsequently highlight the current advances in in situ characterization in LMAs. This review is expected to provide a good understanding of the evolution of Li-dendrites and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), enabling the faster commercialization of Li-metal batteries. Finally, the future research directions in Li-metal batteries in situ characterization are discussed.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Tunable Schottky and ohmic contacts in the Ti2NF2/α-Te van der Waals heterostructure,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Two dimensional α-Te holds great promise in optoelectronic devices because of its high mobility and excellent environmental stability. In this study, the electronic structures and interfacial contact characteristics of the Ti2NF2/α-Te van der Waals heterostructure are investigated by means of first-principles calculations. It is found that p-type Schottky contacts with a Schottky barrier (SB) of 0.21 eV are formed at the Ti2NF2/α-Te interface. By applying external electric fields or controlling the interlayer coupling between the Ti2NF2 and α-Te monolayers, the SB height can be effectively tuned, and all the n-type Schottky, p-type Schottky, n-type ohmic and p-type ohmic contacts can be achieved. Such an extremely high tunability is further found to be closely associated with the charge transfer at the interface, as well as the interface dipole and the potential step. Our results provide an avenue for the design of future α-Te-based electronic devices with high performance.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Disulfide Metathesis-Assisted Lithium-Ion Conduction for PEO-Based Polymer Electrolytes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The disulfide metathesis is a promising candidate in the dynamically exchanged strategy for improving the self-healing ability of polymer electrolytes (PEs). However, the enhancement effects on the ionic conductivities of PEs are generally ignored while introducing a dynamic covalent bond to PEs. Herein, the oligo(ethylene oxide)-based additive containing a disulfide bond (S-S additive) was synthesized via Michael addition reaction of cystamine and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGA). Short PEG chains complexed with Li+ in a S-S additive migrated rapidly in PEs because of the dynamically exchanged strategy of the disulfide bond. Moreover, disulfide bonds in a S-S additive possessed the ability to exchange with the cross-linked network containing disulfide bonds (S-S net). The as-prepared PEs exhibited a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 1.24 × 10-4 S cm-1, demonstrating that the disulfide metathesis-assisted Li+ conduction was feasible for enhancing ionic conductivities of PEs. Relative to other PEO-based PEs, these disulfide-containing PEs possessed a high Li+ transference number (0.54). Furthermore, the lithium-metal batteries (LMBs) assembled with PEs in the presence of a S-S additive presented stable cycle performance, indicating the promising potential of these PEs as candidates for next-generation LMBs.",ACS Macro Letters
Unveiling the Origins of Selective Oxidation in Single-Atom Catalysis via Co-N4-C Intensified Radical and Nonradical Pathways,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Single-atom catalysts (SACs)-based peroxymonosulfate (PMS) systems are highly selective to the type of organic pollutants while the mechanisms remain ambiguous. In this work, we carried out experimental and theoretical investigations to reveal the origins of selectivity of radical and nonradical pathways in a designated Co-N4-C/PMS system. Two typical pollutants [bisphenol A (BPA) and metronidazole (MNZ)] with different molecular structures were employed for comparison. We found that radical oxidation (SO4•-and HO•) and nonradical electron-transfer pathway (ETP) co-existed in the Co-N4-C/PMS system. Pollutants (e.g., MNZ) with a high redox potential were degraded primarily by free radicals rather than ETP, while the oxidization of low-redox pollutants (e.g., BPA) was dominated by ETP at the surface region of Co-N4-C which overwhelmed the contributions of radicals in the homogeneous phase. Intriguingly, the contributions of radical and nonradical pathways could be manipulated by the PMS loading, which simultaneously increased the radical population and elevated the oxidation potential of Co-N4-C-PMS∗ complexes in ETP. Findings from this work will unravel the mysterious selective behavior of the SACs/PMS systems in the oxidation of different micropollutants.",Environmental Science and Technology
"Cation binding of Li(i), Na(i) and Zn(ii) to cobalt and iron sulphide clusters - electronic structure study","© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The binding of alkaline (Li+ and Na+) and zinc (Zn2+) cations to mononuclear disulphides MS2 and to persulphides, containing an S-S bond, M(S2), to binuclear disulphides M2S2 and persulphides M2(S2) and to cubic tetranuclear sulphides M4S4 where M = Fe, Co, is examined by density functional theory with the B3LYP functional, and dispersion corrections were applied. For the small-sized clusters (up to two transition metal centres), the energy gaps between different configurations were verified by CCSD(T) calculations. Persulphides M(S2) are more stable than disulphides MS2 as bare clusters, upon carbonyl and chloride ligand coordination and upon cation binding (Li+, Na+, Zn2+). The one-electron reduction of alkali cations and two-electron reduction of Zn2+ reverses order of stability and the planar disulphides (MS2-reduced cation) become more stable; the energy gap disulphide to persulphide increases. In all reduced clusters, zinc ions form bonds with sulphur and with the transition metal centre (Co or Fe). Lithium cations also form bonds to cobalt or iron, but only in the M2S2 clusters, upon reduction. Energy barriers were calculated for the disulphide to persulphide reaction in the Zn-Co-S2 system in the isolated clusters (gas-phase), in water, acetonitrile and 1-Cl-hexane solution. Most significant decrease in the energy barriers were obtained with less-polar solvents, acetonitrile, and particularly, 1-Cl-hexane. In M4S4 clusters, the cations do not reach optimal coordination to the sulphur centres. The global minima of M2S2 clusters are antiferromagnetic; in the reduced Zn-M2S2 clusters, magnetic moment is induced at zinc centres as a result of charge transfer between Zn and Co or Zn and Fe.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
A Site Distance Effect Induced by Reactant Molecule Matchup in Single-Atom Catalysts for Fenton-Like Reactions,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Understanding the site interaction nature of single-atom catalysts (SACs), especially densely populated SACs, is vital for their application to various catalytic reactions. Herein, we report a site distance effect, which emphasizes how well the distance of the adjacent copper atoms (denoted as dCu1−Cu1) matches with the reactant peroxydisulfate (PDS) molecular size to determine the Fenton-like reaction reactivity on the carbon-supported SACs. The optimized dCu1−Cu1 in the range of 5–6 Å, which matches the molecular size of PDS, endows the catalyst with a nearly two times higher turnover frequency than that of dCu1−Cu1 beyond this range, accordingly achieving record-breaking kinetics for the oxidation of emerging organic contaminants. Further studies suggest that this site distance effect originates from the alteration of PDS adsorption to a dual-site structure on Cu1−Cu1 sites when dCu1−Cu1 falls within 5–6 Å, significantly enhancing the interfacial charge transfer and consequently resulting in the most efficient catalyst for PDS activation so far.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Bifunctional design of cerium-based metal-organic framework-808 membrane modified separator for polysulfide shuttling and dendrite growth inhibition in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022Lithium-sulfur battery is perceived as one promising next generation rechargeable battery system, in view of its high theoretical specific capacity and energy density. However, the “shuttle effect” of polysulfides and the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites significantly obstruct its practical application. Herein, a bifunctional separator with double-sided modification is developed to simultaneously resolve these issues, which is constructed by growing continuous cerium-based metal-organic framework-808 (Ce-MOF-808) membranes on both sides of the commercial polypropylene (PP) separator through a simple in-situ growth method. On the cathode side, the Ce-MOF-808 membrane can play multiple roles of adsorption, selective sieving and catalytic conversion towards polysulfides, thereby effectively inhibiting their shuttle effect. On the anode side, the highly uniform pore distribution and polar groups of this MOF membrane ensure the fast and homogenous diffusion of lithium ions, endowing a stable lithium nucleation and growth in the cycles. Consequently, the Ce-MOF-808/PP separator exhibits a high initial specific capacity of 954.7 mAh g−1 under 1 C with a very limited capacity fading of 0.025% in 500 cycles, and an outstanding rate capability. Moreover, the separator also ensures the stable cycling of the battery at raised sulfur loading and lean-electrolyte conditions.",Journal of Energy Storage
"Rechargeable metal-SO2 batteries: Recent progress, current challenges and future prospects","© 2022 Elsevier LtdTo date, a large number of research programs have been carried out on metal-SO2 (M-SO2) batteries due to their promising applicability in space exploration, electric vehicles, and military purposes. Impressively, the non-flammability of SO2-based electrolytes is the exciting feature of M-SO2 batteries, which could be a solution for safe battery exploration. The primary M-SO2 batteries, especially primary Li-SO2 batteries (LSBs), have an energy density of about 330 W h kg−1, while the secondary LSBs are characterized by their high specific energy density (>1100 W h kg−1) and long shelf-life. Likewise, inspired by the secondary LSBs, rechargeable Na-SO2 batteries (NSBs) have also emerged. Besides, M-SO2 batteries would be more attractive for next-generation metal-gas batteries over metal-air batteries due to their lower charge polarization and higher cell voltage. Therefore, we are inspired to systematically discuss the electrochemistry, performances, and challenges of current M-SO2 batteries. Afterward, as a future direction, this review will provide the improvement strategies for current challenges associated with M-SO2 batteries. While only rechargeable LSBs and NSBs have been reported so far, an outlook is given on promising multivalent metals (such as Mg, Zn, and Al)-SO2 batteries for future development. Likewise, as photo-assisted batteries have recently attracted huge research attention, we will also provide a perspective on photo-assisted rechargeable M-SO2 batteries for future development.",Journal of Energy Storage
Enhanced immobilization and accelerated conversion of polysulfides by functionalized separator for advanced lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries have attracted much attention due to high energy density and low cost. However, some vital issues, especially the notorious shuttle effect of polysulfides has greatly hindered the practical development of Li–S batteries. Reasonable design of electrocatalysts to improve the electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries by enhancing the chemical immobilization and catalytic conversion of polysulfides is considered as a promising solution. Herein, an integrated structure consisting of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets modified with Co9S8 nanoparticles is reported, which is expected to be used as a mediator for Li–S batteries to improve the anchoring and catalyzing of polysulfides. The Co9S8 nanoparticles not only have excellent chemisorption capability to capture polysulfides, but also can be used as catalysts to accelerate the conversion of polysulfides. Highly conductive RGO nanosheets can provide appropriate ion/electron diffusion path length, facilitate interfacial reaction kinetics and physically limit polysulfide diffusion. Accordingly, the as-assembled Li–S battery has excellent cycling stability with a low capacity decay rate of 0.041% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 3 A g−1. Importantly, it enables the device to operate over a wide temperature range, with an area specific capacity of 6.4 mAh cm−2 at a sulfur load of 5.8 mg cm−2.",Journal of Power Sources
Space-confined growth of 2D MOF sheets between GO layers at room temperature for superior PDMS membrane-based ester/water separation,"© 2022Expanding the metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) category using room-temperature colloidal chemistry route with regular crystal structure is challenging, but important for reducing energy consumption and realizing an economically viable application in industry. Herein, we developed a novel advanced copper terephthalate MOF (CuBDC) between graphene oxide (GO) layers using a simple space-confined growth strategy at room temperature. The inclusion of CuBDC@GO can realize high filler loadings while maintaining uniform dispersion throughout PDMS matrix. The paralled arranged CuBDC sheets created 1D inner vertical channels, along with the enlarged GO interlayer space for rapid molecule permeselective transport. The resultant mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with 30 wt% CuBDC@GO loading improved the separation factor from 190.6 to 576.3, and simultaneously increased the total flux from 575.2 to 1357.4 g m-2 h-1 for separating 0.5 wt% butyl acetate at 40 °C. The transport mechanism was explained by adjusting the CuBDC content in composites to examine the significant increase in membrane permeability (from 12.5 to 58.3) and selectivity (from 0.7 to 2.0). Compared to alcohol or ketone, the larger size strip-like butyl acetate molecules are ideal for rapid transport through the CuBDC-supported 1D continuous inner channels, and effectively inhibit the movement of water molecules, ultimately resulting in the largest pervaporation performance improvement in butyl acetate/water separation. This CuBDC@GO prepared by a simple, green and room-temperature synthesis route can be widely applied to prepare defect-free membranes with excellent performance for sustainable applications. We also anticipate that this advanced space-confined growth strategy can be extended to various other MOFs and applications.",Journal of Membrane Science

However, as we known that the single heterojunction cannot get the satisfactory photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, a new double heterojunction photocatalyst was prepared by phosphating Co3O4 on g-C3N4 nanosheets (CNNS/Co3O4@CoP). The as-prepared CNNS/4%Co3O4@7%CoP exhibit excellent catalytic activity, which degradation rate of TC under visible–light irradiation could reach to 92% within 3 h, and the H2 production could reach to 1677.38 μmol g−1 h−1. Photoelectrochemical tests and density functional theory (DFT) analysis show that the synergistic effect between p-n junction (CNNS/Co3O4) and Ohmic junction (Co3O4@CoP) can significantly facilitate charge transfer, prolong the lifetime of photogenerated carriers, and improve the photocatalytic degradation and hydrogen production activity. This work provides an evidential proof of rational designing double heterojunction, and confirms the synergistic effect of double heterojunction can drive charge transfer and separation effectively, which promoting photocatalytic performances.",Applied Surface Science
In-situ synthesis of atomic Co-Nx sites in holey hollow carbon nanospheres for efficiency oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Recently, Metal-Organic Frameworks-derived carbide catalysts draw lots of attention because of their low price, abundant reserves and superior stability. However, the metal element tends to form particles at a high temperature still a challenge to achieving high Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) activity. Herein, a kind of Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) based carbon nanosphere with well-dispersed Co-Nx active sites (Co and N co-doped holey Hollow Carbon nanospheres, hHCS) are prepared by using Polyvinylpyrrolidone as the surfactant to realize the well dispersion of Cobalt. Then KOH activation is used to enlarge specific surfaces area (SSA). In an alkaline medium, the obtained sample shows excellent ORR catalytic performance with a half-ware potential of 0.80 V and a limiting current density of 6.53 mA cm−2, which are even comparable with that of commercial Pt/C. Further, the simple also exhibits remarkable stability during long-term working and better tolerance of methanol. According to the Density Functional Theory (DFT), the outstanding ORR activity can be ascribed to the favorable dispersed Co-Nx. It can be also attributed to the high SSA, hierarchically pore structure and N-base active sites.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Symbiosis of 1 T and 2H phases in the basal plane of defective MoS2 nanoflowers for efficient hydrodesulfurization,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHydrodesulfurization (HDS) is an effective way to reduce sulfur content in oil for the enforcement of more stringent environmental regulations. MoS2 has been widely used as an effective component for catalyzing HDS, and needs to be extensively studied in depth. Herein, MoS2 nanoflowers with the symbiosis of 1T-2H phases in the basal planes and coexistence of S and Mo vacancies are prepared via the assembly of many nanosheets by a one-pot solvothermal method. The morphology, crystal phase structure and defects of these 1T-2H MoS2 samples were well characterized. The 1T/2H ratio and the state of vacancies were effectively tuned by changing the solvothermal conditions. Active and stable 1T-2H mixed MoS2 nanoflowers with high content of 1T phase and moderate S and Mo vacancies were obtained by the regulation of oxalic acid in the mixture of ethanol and water. In the HDS of dibenzothiophene at 300 °C and 4 MPa, the optimal catalyst of MoS2-water–ethanol-OA exhibited a substrate conversion of 89.3% in 10 h. Moreover, the activity of MoS2-water–ethanol-OA was well retained without any decrease in the recycling experiment.",Fuel
Promoting photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline over in-situ grown single manganese atoms on polymeric carbon nitride,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Introducing single-atom metals into polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) framework is a promising strategy to offer more active sites along with pollutant degradation kinetics. Herein, single manganese atoms decorated PCN (denoted as MCN) was fabricated via a straightforward in-situ thermopolymerization strategy using urea as PCN precursor and manganese acetylacetone as manganese (Mn) source. The as-synthesized optimal sample MCN-2 exhibits legible monatomic Mn sites on PCN framestructure and enhanced specific surface area (122.4 m2·g−1). The monatomic Mn introduced via the Mn-N/O coordination is demonstrated to be able to narrow the bandgap and facilitate separation and transfer of photo-excited carriers, which has a salutary effect on visible-light harvesting and MCN utilization. Consequently, the MCN-2 exerts a superior pseudo-first-order kinetic rate constant k of 0.041 min−1 in visible-light-driven TC photodegradation, with ca. 13-fold higher than that of the pristine PCN. Further, the intermediates and reactive oxygen species (1O2, h+ and •O2–) generating in the TC photodegradation process are experimentally manifested and a plausible mechanism for TC degradation over MCN is proposed. This work not only proves the efficacy of MCN in photodegradation of TC but expands Mn to other single-atom metals for pollutant removal.",Applied Surface Science

In this manuscript, we explore the molecularly modified halide perovskite films via the combination of machine learning, photoelectrochemical experiments and first-principles calculations. The optoelectronic properties of the molecularly engineered halide perovskite surfaces in the aqueous solution are comprehensively evaluated with a case study on the prototypical CH3NH3PbI3 film modified by a D-π-A molecule ethyl red. The accurate machine learning model with an accuracy of 96% is constructed via the ExtraTrees algorithm to classify the photocurrents produced by the ethyl red/perovskite surface systems in water. Chemical insights are obtained by analyzing the molecular descriptors and the experimental features, suggesting the importance of the molecular concentration as well as the molecular shapes and chemical compositions of the solvent environments for the perovskite optoelectronic properties. The first-principles calculations reveal the formation of O···Pb bonds and additional octahedrons at the perovskite surface in the presence of the molecular surface modifier and the water molecule. The intricate influences and the double-edged sword effects of the surface molecular modifier and the water molecule on the optoelectronic properties of the halide perovskite surface are further elucidated. The present study demonstrates an effective workflow combining machine learning, high-throughput experiments and first-principles calculations to comprehensively evaluate the halide perovskite films and can be elaborated to other molecularly modified surface systems in complex environments via multiple research paradigms.",Applied Surface Science

The unique interconnected structure of hollow carbon skeleton doped by F and N facilitating rapid Li ions diffusion in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHollow carbons are considered as one of promising host materials applied in lithium-sulfur batteries because sulfur can be well encapsulated in these hollow units. However, the ineffective contact among these discrete units tends to cause high lithium ions diffusion barrier and interunit resistance, thus reducing sulfur conversion kinetics and utilization. Herein, a hollow carbon skeleton (NFHC) with interconnected tubular cavity is fabricated by successfully replicating the nanostructure complementary to attapulgite fiber bundle templates. The unique interconnected structure and introduction of polar F and N sites facilitate lithium ions diffusion and inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides through chemisorption.

"Lanthanum ion modification of aminated cyclomatrix polyphosphazene-coated porous carbon nanosheets for rapid, efficient and selective removal of phosphate","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Phosphate removal has been the top priority in eutrophic wastewater treatment. Herein we reported a fast, efficient and selective adsorbent, PCNs@PCP-La, for phosphate removal from an aqueous medium. The adsorbent was fabricated via two steps: (1) synthesis of PCNs@PCP composite through in situ polymerization of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene and polyethyleneimine on the porous carbon nanosheets; and (2) lanthanum ion (La3+) modification of PCNs@PCP via an impregnation process to create PCNs@PCP-La hybrid. Multiple characterizations showed that the atomically dispersed La3+ ions could be facilely chelated with nitrogen-rich cyclomatrix polyphosphazene framework, significantly improving the application efficiency of La3+ ions as active adsorption sites. Comparative tests confirmed that PCNs@PCP-La had a high phosphate uptake capacity of up to 121.2 mg P g−1 (pH = 4.0) at 298 K and performed well even in a wide pH range (3.0–9.0). Also, PCNs@PCP-La showed a particularly short saturated adsorption time (5 min), indicating a fast adsorption kinetic process. Meanwhile, PCNs@PCP-La presented a superior adsorption selectivity for phosphate under interference with coexisting anions/cation and humic acid, and owned an attractive reusability (after 5th cycles, 85% capacity retention).

Etch-evaporation enabled defect engineering to prepare high-loading Mn single atom catalyst for Li-S battery applications,"© 2022Excellent specific discharge capacity and cycling stability are essential for high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, but hard to achieve simultaneously due to the shuttle effect and sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfides. Herein, we report an etch-evaporation enabled defect engineering strategy to fabricate atomically dispersed, manganese-nitrogen doped porous carbon (Mn-N-C) for separator modification. With Zinc atoms evaporation and NH3 etch, abundant spatial confinement sites and N dopants are created in Mn-N-C, and the final Mn loading can reach as high as 2.31 wt%. Density function theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mn atoms in Mn-N-C play a crucial role in polysulfides adsorption and electrical conductivity enhancement. Therefore, the Mn-N-C modified separator can exhibit high conductivity, strong immobilization and excellent catalytic activity, thus favoring polysulfides conversion and Li2S nucleation/dissolution. The Li-S battery equipped with the modified separator exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1596 mAh g−1 at 0.1C (S loading mass was 1.2 mg cm−2), which decays 0.045 % per cycle after 1000 cycles at 1C. Our work demonstrates that the etch-evaporation enabled defect engineering strategy is effective for fabrication of high-performance Li-S battery catalyst; it also shows an attractive prospect to synthesize other high loading metal ion dispersed, nitrogen doped carbon materials for electrochemical applications.",Chemical Engineering Journal

In this work, the Mott-Schottky electrocatalyst Cu NDs/Fe2O3-NPCs was developed by creating Cu nanodots (NDs)/Fe2O3 heterojunction nanoislands rooted on N-rich porous carbon nanosheets (NPCs). The formed Mott-Schottky heterojunction Cu NDs/Fe2O3 nanoislands promoted the electron transfer from the metallic Cu to the semiconductive Fe2O3 phase, as a result, the adsorptions towards O2 and OH− species were improved, and sequentially the catalytic activities for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were both remarkably enhanced. In addition, the porous nature of the developed catalyst also contributed to the effectiveness of the required mass transfer. The optimal Mott-Schottky Cu NDs/Fe2O3-NPCs catalyst exhibited an onset potential of 0.98 V and a Tafel slop of 53.7 mV dec-1 for ORR, and an overpotential of 328 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for OER.

Oxygen-Plasma-Treated Fe-N-C Catalysts with Dual Binding Sites for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Enhanced polysulfide conversion kinetics is essential for realizing lithium-sulfur batteries with high energy density and rate performance and promising cyclability. The modification of the local atomic structure of MNxactive sites in single-atom M-N-C catalysts was proposed to improve their electrocatalytic activity for demanding reactions by fine-tuning the interaction with reaction intermediates. Here, we demonstrate that engineering the binding geometry of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by introducing dual binding sites improves the LiPS conversion kinetics. We use mild oxygen plasma treatment to introduce oxygen species into the Fe-N-C catalyst. The plasma-treated Fe-N-C (pFeNG) catalyst with dual sulfiphilic (mononuclear iron) and lithiophilic (oxygen) binding sites has a lower polysulfide decomposition energy, especially for Li2S redox, which is known to be the most sluggish process.

Newly Designed One-Pot In-Situ Synthesis of VS2/rGO Nanocomposite to Explore Its Electrochemical Behavior towards Oxygen Electrode Reactions**,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.A facile and effective one-step in-situ technique for the synthesis of layered two-dimensional metallic vanadium sulfide-reduced graphene oxide (VS2/rGO) nanocomposite (NComp) hasbeen described and their electrocatalytic properties towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been studied. From transmission and scanning electron microscopy analyses, it was observed that the layered two-dimensional VS2 nanoparticles successfully grew over the layered graphene matrix. The as-synthesized NComp displayed excellent electrocatalytic activities towards ORR with a four-electron transfer pathway, and OER in alkaline medium. The synthesized nanocatalyst exhibits lower ΔE value (0.75 V) as compared to other literature values, high catalytic current density (−6.26 mA cm−2 for ORR) with a lower Tafel slope (59 mV dec−1), as compared to Pt/C, and lower overpotential (η=0.31 V at 10 mA cm−2 for OER) with a smaller Tafel slope (68 mV dec−1) than those of RuO2. Moreover, it displays high electrochemically active surface area, long-term stability in alkaline medium and good resistance to the methanol crossover effect. The enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic properties of the synthesized nanocatalyst may be owing to the synergistic effect of combining VS2 and rGO, which improves the surface area, adsorption of reaction intermediates, active sites density, and electrical conductivity. Along with the high stability of the hybrid NComp, these advantages provide immense promise for triggering breakthroughs in fuel-cell electrocatalysis.",ChemElectroChem
Edge-Rich Graphene Nanospheres with Ultra-High Nitrogen Loading Metal-Free Electrocatalysts for Boosted Oxygen Reduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Nitrogen (N) doping in graphene-based materials has been demonstrated as an effective strategy in constructing active sites of metal-free catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The practical applications of metal-free electrocatalysts in metal-air batteries or fuel cells, nevertheless, have been hampered by their unsatisfactory catalytic performance due to insufficient catalytic active sites. In this work, a novel N-rich graphene nanospheres (NGNs) have been achieved by adopting an edge engineering strategy through annealing the mixture of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and edge-rich graphene nanospheres (GNs) composed of graphene nanoflakes. Benefiting from the exposure of edge defects in the GNs, the N loading surprisingly achieved as high as 14.01 at%. The half-wave potential and limiting current density of the synthesized NGNs-900 catalyst can reach 0.872 V and 4.25 mA cm−2, respectively, which are superior to that of the commercial Pt/C. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, the synergistic effect of graphitic-N and pyridinic-N in NGNs catalysts has been distinguished as the origin of the boosted ORR performance. This work proposes a facile synthesis strategy to optimize the N-doped carbon-based catalysts for ORR, which have great potential to replace noble-metal catalysts.",ChemElectroChem
A Multi-Functional Separator for Li-S Batteries: WS2@C Nanoflowers Catalyze the Rapid Recycling of Lithium Polysulfides by Polar Attraction,"© 2022 The Authors. ChemElectroChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Featuring high theoretical capacity, environmental friendliness and low cost, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries become promising alternatives to satisfy the growing demand for energy storage. To boost their energy density for practical application, modified separators are needed to suppress shuttle effects resulting from the solubility of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, we modified traditional polypropylene (PP) separators with functional WS2@C nanoflower composites (WS2@C-PP). They can effectively adsorb LiPSs and catalyze their conversion on the edge sites of the WS2. Also, the unique construction of a carbon layer coating on the WS2 nanoflowers combines active sites and conducting properties. The material benefits the reversibility of redox reactions and reutilization of active materials. With the WS2@C-PP separator, the cell displays improved cycling stability and rate performance. When cycling at 0.1 C, the cell discharges a capacity of up to 1475 mAh g−1, and it contributes 943 mAh g−1 originally at 1 C, with a decay rate of only 0.07 % after 500 cycles. Our work highlights the potential of functional separators to advance the properties of Li-S batteries.",ChemElectroChem
Fast catalytic transfer hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol over urea modified Ni@CN nanoparticles,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.A series of stable N-doped porous carbon encapsulated Ni nanoparticles (Ni@CN) were prepared via direct pyrolysis of Ni-MOF-74(N) and utilized for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of phenol to cyclohexanol with isopropanol as a hydrogen donor. The prepared catalysts were characterized by means of TG, XRD, BET, SEM, TEM and XPS. The effects of preparation and reaction conditions on the CTH performance were investigated. The results showed that the Ni particles of Ni@CN were smaller than that of Ni@C, which reflected that the doping of nitrogen could improve the dispersion of Ni nanoparticles. Moreover, electrons can be redistributed with N-doping. These two factors contribute to better catalytic activity. The Ni@CN-450 catalyst exhibited 99.3% phenol conversion with 100% cyclohexanol selectivity. Moreover, the catalysts could be recycled and reused easily with the help of a magnet and its catalytic performance did not decrease obviously even after five successive cycles.",New Journal of Chemistry
Robust Analysis of 4e-Versus 6e-Reduction of Nitrogen on Metal Surfaces and Single-Atom Alloys,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The electrochemical synthesis of hydrazine is an exciting avenue in the sustainable production of commonly used chemicals. Taking inspiration from the mechanistic selectivity of reactions such as the 2e- versus 4e- oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), we explore how to fine-tune catalysts for hydrazine synthesis through the 4e- electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) over the popular 6e- NRR used for ammonia synthesis. Optimal 4e- NRR performance requires sufficient activity as well as selectivity over 6e- NRR, other mechanistic NRR branching points, and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we perform first-principles calculations in conjunction with uncertainty quantification on various monometallic and single-atom alloy surfaces to study the activity and selectivity of 4e- NRR. Through free energy diagrams, estimation of scaling relations, and a theoretical activity volcano, we observe that catalysts exhibiting low activity due to weak binding for NH3 favor hydrazine synthesis. We also find that single-atom alloys follow the same scaling relations as monometallic surfaces. Through uncertainty quantification, we form distributions of limiting potentials and establish a correlation between the activity of a catalyst with the skewness of its limiting potential distribution. We further quantify the uncertainty of first-principles calculations for branching points within 4e- NRR. Reaction branching point analysis reveals the difficulty of overcoming the HER for weakly binding catalysts and the affinity toward 6e- NRR for stronger binding catalysts. This underlines the significant challenges of pushing NRR toward hydrazine synthesis.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
A Synthesis Strategy of Double-Atom Catalysts on a Carbon Surface,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Highly active double-atom catalysts (DACs) for electrochemical reactions hold promise to enable sustainable energy conversion and storage. However, fabricating stable DACs remains challenging due to the lack of a fundamental understanding of the formation and stabilization mechanisms of DACs. Here, we present a systematic investigation of the feasibility of forming DACs on a defective carbon surface, through density functional theory calculations, from which an effective synthesis strategy of DACs is proposed. Such a synthesis strategy is validated by molecular dynamics simulations of the process of the formation of a stable array of Pt-Au DACs on a defective carbon surface. Results from this study offer a mechanistic understanding and quantitative guidance for the rational selection of transition metals and optimal synthesis conditions to fabricate DACs with desirable electrocatalyst activity in emerging energy applications.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Enhance of CoSe2/C Composites Modified Separator on Electrochemical Performance of Li-S Batteries at High Sulfur Loading CoSe2/C 复合电催化材料修饰隔膜对高载量锂硫电池性能的影响,"© 2022 Higher Education Press. All rights reserved.Herein, CoSe2/C composite was obtained by a simple two-step calcining method with the rhombohedral dodecahedral ZIF-67 as the template. The CoSe2 nanoparticles with diameters of approximately 30 nm were dispersed in the carbon skeleton maintaining the structure of the template. Systematically electrochemical results demonstrated that the CoSe2/C composite could fasten the kinetics of the soluble lithium polysulfides, as well as guide the deposition of the insoluble Li2S during the discharge process. In addition, the CoSe2/C could also boost the oxidation of Li2S. It was loaded on commercial Celgard 2400 separators as the electrocatalytic materials. It is worth to note that the mass loading of the modified layer is only 0.15 mg/cm2, in which the CoSe2/C composite only accounts for 30% (mass fraction). Consequently, the cells with CoSe2/C-modified separator delivered a superior electrochemical performance, which with a high sulfur loading of 4.8 mg/cm2 gave an initial specific capacity of 756 mA·h/g at 0.2C and maintained at 715 mA·h/g after 180 cycles, with a capacity decay rate of 0.031% per cycle.",Gaodeng Xuexiao Huaxue Xuebao/Chemical Journal of Chinese Universities
Atomically Dispersed Fe-N5Sites Anchored on 3D N-Doped Porous Carbon for Efficient Selective Oxidation of Aromatic Alkanes at Room Temperature,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.On account of the increasing demand for aromatic ketones and the challenging task of mass production in the chemical industry, efficient and sustainable catalysts are urgently needed to catalyze the conversion of aromatic alkyl compounds into high value-added products via the activation of C-H bonds. Herein, Fe single-site atoms anchored on a N-doped three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon nanostructure (Fe-MEG-800) synthesized through the self-assembly hydrothermal method are reported. Detailed characterization analyses, such as aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM), are employed to prove the isolated single Fe atom dispersing on the carbon nanostructure, along with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Mössbauer spectroscopy analysis confirming the Fe-N5 coordination structure. Furthermore, the 3D cross-linked structure not only provides an abundant open-framework structure for the mass transfer during the reaction but also facilitates the exposure of more active sites and promotes the reaction procedure. The as-prepared catalyst possesses high catalytic activity toward the C-H bond at room temperature. In the model reaction of oxidizing ethylbenzene (EB) to high-value acetophenone (AcPO), the conversion and the selectivity of the reaction are both over 99%. In addition, the catalyst also presents favorable stability with retaining high performance even after eight cycles. The possible adsorption sites of the reactant and oxidant are explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Based on the analysis of experimental and theoretical results, a possible mechanism for the oxidation of EB to AcPO involving •OH, O2•-, and 1O2 is also proposed.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Scalable 3D Honeycombed Co3O4Modified Separators as Polysulfides Barriers for High-Performance Li-S Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs) are regarded as one of the most promising energy storage devices due to the high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, the shuttling lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) from the cathode and the growing lithium dendrites on the anode limit the practical application of LSBs. To overcome these challenges, a novel three-dimensional (3D) honeycombed architecture consisting of a local interconnected Co3O4 successfully assembled into a scalable modified layer through mutual support, which is coated on commercial separators for high-performance LSBs. On the basis of the 3D honeycombed architecture, the modified separators not only suppress effectively the ""shuttle effects""but also allow for fast lithium-ions transportation. Moreover, the theoretical calculations results exhibit that the collaboration of the exposed (111) and (220) crystal planes of Co3O4 is able to effectively anchor LiPSs. As expected, LSBs with 3D honeycombed Co3O4 modified separators present a reversible specific capacity with 1007 mAh g-1 over 100 cycles at 0.1 C. More importantly, a high reversible capacity of 808 mAh g-1 over 300 cycles even at 1 C is also acquired with the modified separators. Therefore, this proposed strategy of 3D honeycombed architecture Co3O4 modified separators will give a new route to rationally devise durable and efficient LSBs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Strengthened d-p Orbital Hybridization through Asymmetric Coordination Engineering of Single-Atom Catalysts for Durable Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Although single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been largely explored in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, the commonly reported nonpolar transition metal-N4 coordinations only demonstrate inferior adsorption and catalytic activity toward shuttled lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, single Fe atoms with asymmetric coordination configurations of Fe-N3C2-C were precisely designed and synthesized as efficient immobilizer and catalyst for LiPSs. The experimental and theoretical results elucidate that the asymmetrically coordinated Fe-N3C2-C moieties not only enhance the LiPSs anchoring capability by the formation of extra π-bonds originating from S p orbital and Fe dx2-y2/dxy orbital hybridization but also boost the redox kinetics of LiPSs with reduced Li2S precipitation/decomposition barrier, leading to suppressed shuttle effect. Consequently, the Li-S batteries assembled with Fe-N3C2-C exhibit high areal capacity and cycling stability even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions. This work highlights the important role of coordination symmetry of SACs for promoting the practical application of Li-S batteries.",Nano Letters
Solid-State Reaction Synthesis of Nanoscale Materials: Strategies and Applications,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Nanomaterials (NMs) with unique structures and compositions can give rise to exotic physicochemical properties and applications. Despite the advancement in solution-based methods, scalable access to a wide range of crystal phases and intricate compositions is still challenging. Solid-state reaction (SSR) syntheses have high potential owing to their flexibility toward multielemental phases under feasibly high temperatures and solvent-free conditions as well as their scalability and simplicity. Controlling the nanoscale features through SSRs demands a strategic nanospace-confinement approach due to the risk of heat-induced reshaping and sintering. Here, we describe advanced SSR strategies for NM synthesis, focusing on mechanistic insights, novel nanoscale phenomena, and underlying principles using a series of examples under different categories. After introducing the history of classical SSRs, key theories, and definitions central to the topic, we categorize various modern SSR strategies based on the surrounding solid-state media used for nanostructure growth, conversion, and migration under nanospace or dimensional confinement.

Polysulfides immobilization and conversion by nitrogen-doped porous carbon/graphitized carbon nitride heterojunction for high-rate lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022Improving efficiency of solid-liquid-solid multiphase conversion of sulfur to Li2S and suppressing lithium polysulfide shuttle phenomenon are crucial tasks for industrialization of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this study, a novel honeycomb-like nitrogen-doped porous carbon/graphitized carbon nitride (HPCG) heterojunction nanocatalyst is prepared using truncated rhombic dodecahedral zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (TRD-ZIF-8) nanoparticles as a synthesis template. A unique hierarchical porous structure and abundant active catalytic sites of HPCG can effectively immobilize polysulfides, accelerate long-chain polysulfide conversion and promote Li2S nucleation, thereby inhibiting the shuttle effect. HPCG cells exhibit good rate performance and excellent high-rate cycling stability with only 0.073% capacity decay per cycle after 1000 cycles at 5 C. Specifically, a cell with a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 9.6 µL mg−1 demonstrates stable operation over 300 cycles at 1C.

Solid Li- and Na-Ion Electrolytes for Next Generation Rechargeable Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.We dedicate this paper to Prof. John B. Goodenough's 100th birthday, who has made several seminal contributions to the modern electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies that made significant social and economic impacts on humankind. This review paper reports two battery systems that he contributed in the early stage of solid-state ionics (SSIs). The development of advanced Li and or Na batteries based on solid-state (ceramic) electrolytes (SSEs) is being focused on because of their safety, high energy density, and design flexibility for high power and energy density applications. Several SSEs exhibit a higher electrochemical stability window, enabling various high voltage cathodes to improve the power density compared to organic liquid electrolytes-based batteries (except for sulfide-based electrolytes). However, most SSEs have lower (at least an order of magnitude) ionic conductivity and poor interface compatibility compared to liquid electrolytes. Attempts have been made to improve the ionic conductivity and interface of SSEs and electrodes and develop hybrid solid electrolytes with improved ionic conductivity and stability with an elemental anode and high voltage cathodes. Here, we discuss the materials aspects of SSEs and hybrid SSEs for next-generation Li and Na batteries. Various solid-state electrolytes, including hydride-type, silicates, LISICONs, NASICON-type oxides, glassy-type oxides, covalent organic frameworks, perovskite-type oxides, antiperovskites, Li-stuffed garnet-related structure oxides, and metal halides have been developed. The chemical composition-structure-ionic conductivity relationship of several key SSEs and the ion transport mechanism have been discussed in this study. Moreover, interfacial engineering methods for some typical SSEs and battery applications have also been discussed.",Chemistry of Materials
Fabrication of Cubic and Porous Carbon Cages with In-Situ-Grown Carbon Nanotube Networks and Cobalt Phosphide for High-Capacity and Stable Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their high specific capacity, low cost, and eco-friendly raw material. However, the insulating property of sulfur and dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) lead to rapid capacity decay and low Coulombic efficiency. In this work, we smartly synthesized a composite material as the host material of active S by a facile one-step pyrolysis method. It was composed of in-situ-grown carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and CoP particles inside the porous carbon cages (denoted as CoP-CNT@C). The CNT networks in porous carbon cages can improve the conductivity of the cathode, while the CoP particles are capable of enhancing the adsorption of LiPSs, thereby effectively mitigating the ""shuttle effect"". Moreover, the porous structure of the carbon cages could effectively store the elemental sulfur. As a matter of fact, the Li-S battery based on the CoP-CNT@C/S cathode exhibited an ultrahigh initial specific capacity of 1456.8 mAh g-1at 0.1C and superior performance (663.3 mAh g-1) at a high current rate of 3C. It is worth mentioning that a capacity of 473.9 mAh g-1has been retained after 750 cycles tested at 0.5C, indicating the outstanding stability of the Li-S battery based on the CoP-CNT@C/S cathode. Overall, the CoP-CNT@C composite prepared is promising for the application of Li-S batteries as the host material.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering

The principles, mechanisms, and opportunities for plastic valorization by leveraging chemical catalytic technologies (thermo-, electro-, and photocatalytic) as well as biocatalytic ones are summarized and discussed, which may provide more insights for the future design of catalytic processes. Finally, the outlooks and perspectives to accelerate progress toward a feasible plastic economy are discussed.",ACS Catalysis
Self-supported Co–Mo sulfide in electrospun carbon nanofibers as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline medium,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of high-efficiency and cheap electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is of great importance for the electrochemical production of hydrogen. In this study, self-supported CoMoS on carbon nanofiber (CoMoS@CNF) catalysts were prepared through a one-step hydrothermal method using carbonized, electrospun polyacrylonitrile–dopamine (DA) polymeric fibers. The –OH group on DA was utilized to immobilize 1,2,3,4-Butanetetracarboxylic acid on the surface of the modified fiber, which consequently captured Co and Mo ions. Self-supported CoMoS nanosheet and nanosphere clusters grew on the surface of the CNF. The core–shell and layered nanosheet stacked structures created abundant accessible active sites, convenient ion diffusion pathways, and opened channels for the rapid release of the evolved H2. Density functional theory calculations showed that the heterojunctions constructed from CoS2 and Mo2S3 had low free energies for the adsorption of hydrogen. The prepared CoMoS@CNF electrode required a low overpotential (105.2 mV) to reach 10 mV cm−2 in 1 M KOH and showed no deterioration in the electrochemical performance even after 20 h of continuous operation at a 10 mV overpotential. The excellent activity and stability of the self-supported CoMoS@CNF electrocatalysts toward HER in alkaline medium is possibly due to its advantageous electronic and geometrical structure.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Surfactant modified CNTs@S as cathode materials for high rate performance lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The cathode materials are an important aspect of lithium sulfur battery research. This paper focuses on the electrochemical changes in the interface between cathode and electrolyte, via the surface modification of CNTs@S composites by different types of surfactant. And the cause of this phenomenon is speculated through some comparative experiments. We find that the surfactant adsorbed on the surface of the CNTs@S produce two effects in opposite directions on the interface between cathode and electrolyte: On the one hand, interaction between the hydrophilic group of surfactant and the electrolyte reducing the charge transfer impedance and improving the electrochemical reaction rate; On the other hand, the contact between the hydrophobic group of surfactant and CNTs@S leads a new impedance creating. If these two opposite effects are properly controlled, the battery impedance can be substantially reduced. Finally, with the CNTs@S cathode modified by APG, the charge transfer impedance decreased from 127.2 Ω to about 6.3 Ω, even with the newly generated contact impedance, the total impedance is approximately 1/9 of the original. This change increases the maximum charge and discharge current density of the CNTs@S battery from 1 C to 7 C. Even both with a high sulfur loading of 5.3 mg cm−2 and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 4.1 mL g−1, the Li-S batteries with CNTs@S cathode modified by APG still deliver a high capacity of 2.38 mAh cm−2 (66% of initial capacity) after 50 cycles. Moreover, this simple modification strategy is suitable in different carbon-sulfur composites to improve the high current density charge and the discharge performance of Li-S batteries. It brings a new mentality to the industrial application of Li-S batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Perylene diimide growth on both sides of carbon nanotubes for remarkably boosted photocatalytic degradation of diclofenac,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Perylene diimide and its derivatives are promising photocatalysts for clean and efficient production, but their practical application in the field of photocatalysis is still limited by the rapid photogenerated charge recombination. In this work, the confined photocatalysts were synthesized by using a gas-phase self-assembly method and comparing the morphology and photocatalytic properties of different photocatalysts after the confinement of carbon nanotubes. The confinement effect of carbon nanotubes acts to stabilize perylene diimide. Electrostatic interaction formed by a wide range of dispersion forces is dominant in the process of stabilization. Benefitting from the three-dimensional electron transfer pathway formed by the conjugation of perylene diimide with a large number of π electrons to the carbon nanotubes plane, the confined photocatalyst shows the pseudo-first-order kinetic constant k of 1.106 h−1 for the photocatalytic degradation of diclofenac under light, which is 6.11 times higher than that of perylene diimide. The electron transfer created an internal electric field at the interface from carbon nanotubes to perylene diimide, which greatly accelerated the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and improved the photocatalytic activity. This study further expands the applicability of perylene diimide in the field of photocatalysis and provides a new approach for water environment treatment.",Journal of Hazardous Materials
Metal-organic framework derived rod-like Co@carbon for electrochemical detection of nitrite,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Low-dimensional (LD) materials show great potential in sensing applications due to their attractive properties. Herein, Co@N-doped carbon nanorods (CoN-CRs) were prepared via the pyrolysis of a rod-like Co-ZIF-L precursor, which was synthesized using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The fabricated CoN-CRs were characterized by a series of techniques, and their electrochemical sensing behavior towards nitrite was subsequently evaluated. Compared with Co@N-doped carbon sheets (CoN-CSs), CoN-CRs exhibited enhanced performance for nitrite detection due to their higher surface area and more accessible active sites. Under optimized conditions, the CoN-CRs-based sensor was able to determine nitrite concentration in two linear ranges (0.5–4000 and 4000–8000 μM), with corresponding sensitivity values of 1.03 μA μM−1 cm−2 and 0.82 μA μM−1 cm−2, respectively, and a detection limit of 0.17 μM. Moreover, this sensor exhibited good selectivity, stability and reproducibility, and provided satisfactory feasibility for the analysis of nitrite in sausage samples and tap water. This work demonstrates that CoN-CRs are promising sensing materials for nitrite monitoring.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Cobalt-decorated carbon nanofibers as a low overpotential cathode for nonaqueous Na-CO2 batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.As the high energy-density energy storage and greenhouse gas capture device, Na-CO2 battery development is impeded by the sluggish CO2 reduction and difficult decomposition of insulating discharge products on the cathode. Here, the cobalt (Co)-decorated carbon nanofibers accompanying with slight Co oxidation were used as the self-standing cathode for Na-CO2 battery. It greatly reduces the discharge overpotential by 500 mV and charge overpotential by 210 mV, delivers a 12 times higher discharge capacity and runs nearly 4 times cycle life than its counterpart. Experiment combined with theory calculation demonstrates that the evenly dispersive, abundant and stable active sites (Co-CoO) with an equal CO2 adsorption-desorption capability is the key to improving cell performance. This work reveals the importance of catalysts/cathodes and provides a direction to design highly efficient catalysts/cathodes for alkali metal-CO2 batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Herein, we report a bifunctional electrocatalyst synthesized by anchoring individually dispersed Ni single atoms on N-doped carbon nanosheets (Ni SAs-NC), which exhibits an outstanding overall performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Based on that, a conceptual urea-assisted rechargeable ZAB by coupling ORR with UOR of a low thermodynamic potential is demonstrated to have significantly decreased charging voltage and high urea elimination rate. The high bifunctional electrocatalytic activities of Ni SAs-NC endow the urea-assisted ZAB with a dramatically increased energy conversion efficiency of 71.8%, which is improved by 17.1% as compares with the conventional ZABs. The successful implementation of Ni SACs based urea-assisted rechargeable ZABs with an improved energy conversion efficiency may prompt ZAB technology towards practical applications.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

Double Heteroatom Reconfigured Polar Catalytic Surface Powers High-Performance Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 by the authors.The modification of apolar carbon materials by heteroatom doping is an effective method that can effectively improve the surface polarity of carbon materials. In the main body of the lithium–sulfur battery cathode, the structural properties of the carbon material itself with porous structure and large specific surface area provide sufficient space for sulfur accommodation and mitigate the bulk effect of the sulfur cathode (79%). The polarized surface of the reconstructed carbon material possesses strong adsorption effect on LiPs, which mitigates the notorious “shuttle effect.” In this paper, the surface structure of the Ketjen black cathode body was reconstructed by B and N double heteroatoms to polarize it. The modified polarized Ketjen black improves the adsorption and anchoring ability of LiPs during the reaction and accelerates their kinetic conversion, while its own uniformly distributed small mesopores and oversized BET structural properties are beneficial to mitigate the bulk effect of sulfur cathodes. Lithium–sulfur batteries using B and N modified cathodes have an initial discharge capacity of 1344.49 mAh/g at 0.1 C and excellent cycling stability at 0.5 C (381.4 mAh/g after 100 cycles).",Materials
A Dual Functional Artificial SEI Layer Based on a Facile Surface Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Anode,"© 2022 by the authors.Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on a Li anode is critical to the interface stability and cycle life of Li metal batteries. On the one hand, components of SEI with the passivation effect can effectively hinder the interfacial side reactions to promote long-term cycling stability. On the other hand, SEI species that exhibit the active site effect can reduce the Li nucleation barrier and guide Li deposition homogeneously. However, strategies that only focus on a separated effect make it difficult to realize an ideal overall performance of a Li anode. Herein, a dual functional artificial SEI layer simultaneously combining the passivation effect and the active site effect is proposed and constructed via a facial surface chemistry method. Simultaneously, the formed LiF component effectively passivates the anode/electrolyte interface and contributes to the long-term stable cycling performance, while the Li-Mg solid solution alloy with the active site effect promotes the transmission of Li+ and guides homogeneous Li deposition with a low energy barrier. Benefiting from these advantages, the Li||Li cell with the modified anode performs with a lower nucleation overpotential of 2.3 mV, and an ultralong cycling lifetime of over 2000 h at the current density of 1 mA cm−2, while the Li||LiFePO4 full battery maintains a capacity retention of 84.6% at rate of 1 C after 300 cycles.",Molecules

Vanadium Nitride Supported on N-Doped Carbon as High-Performance ORR Catalysts for Zn–Air Batteries,"© 2022 by the authors.It is desirable to prepare low-cost non-noble metal catalysts using a simple and efficient method. Herein, we display for the first time that nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon-supported vanadium nitride (VN/NC/C-x) catalysts can be regulated by dicyandiamide (DCDA). The introduction of DCDA not only effectively controls the pore structure, but also plays an important role in adjusting oxygen vacancies and d-electrons. In addition, DCDA is not only a significant raw material for the N-doped carbon, but also a nitrogen source for the preparation of vanadium nitride. The VN/NC/C-3 catalyst was prepared after optimization of the preparation parameters, and the macro/micro structure demonstrates a superior ORR performance in alkaline media with a positive onset potential of 0.85 V and a half-wave potential of 0.75 V, the limiting current density is as high as 4.52 mA·cm−2, and the Tafel slope is only 75.54 mV·dec−1. The VN/NC/C-3-based Zn–air battery exhibits a highest peak power density (161.82 mW∙cm−2) and an excellent energy density (702.28 mAh·kgZn−1 and 861.51 Wh·kgZn−1). This work provides a valuable synthetic approach for the preparation of other transition metal nitride catalysts with a relative economic value and high performance.",Catalysts
A Review of the Application of Modified Separators in Inhibiting the “shuttle effect” of Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 by the authors.Lithium-sulfur batteries with high theoretical specific capacity and high energy density are considered to be one of the most promising energy storage devices. However, the “shuttle effect” caused by the soluble polysulphide intermediates migrating back and forth between the positive and negative electrodes significantly reduces the active substance content of the battery and hinders the commercial applications of lithium–sulfur batteries. The separator being far from the electrochemical reaction interface and in close contact with the electrode poses an important barrier to polysulfide shuttle. Therefore, the electrochemical performance including coulombic efficiency and cycle stability of lithium–sulfur batteries can be effectively improved by rationally designing the separator. In this paper, the research progress of the modification of lithium–sulfur battery separators is reviewed from the perspectives of adsorption effect, electrostatic effect, and steric hindrance effect, and a novel modification of the lithium–sulfur battery separator is prospected.",Membranes
Enhanced Performance of nZVI/MXene@CNTs for Rapid As(III) Removal from Aqueous Solutions,"© 2022 by the authors.nZVI/MXene@CNTs with a three-dimensional intercalation structure was successfully synthesized. nZVI/MXene@CNTs exhibited a high adsorption and catalytic oxidation capacity for As(III). nZVI/MXene@CNTs showed good anti-interference ability. nZVI/MXene@CNTs possessed excellent recyclability and reusability. Highlights: Transition metal compounds demonstrated good performance in the removal of environmentally harmful contaminants, such as arsenic, while the aggregation propensity and poor chemical stability should be noticed. In this study, the nZVI/MXene@CNTs was adequately prepared by liquid reduction precipitation method for adsorption and oxidation of As(III) from the aqueous solution. The results of batch removal experiments showed that the maximum removal capacity of the nZVI/MXene@CNTs for As(III) was 443.32 mg/g with the pH = 3.0 at 25 °C. The effects of initial pH, dosage of materials and ionic strength on As(III) removal were explored. According to the various characterization analyses, the most plausible mechanisms of As(III) removal were the surface complexation, solid phase precipitation and the catalytic oxidation by the •OH. Furthermore, the nZVI/MXene@CNTs could be readily activated and reused via leaching with 0.1 M NaOH solution, due to the three-dimensional mesh intercalation structure. Therefore, it is a potential nanocomplex for removing and recovering As(III) from water with excellent capacity and environmental friendliness.",Applied Sciences (Switzerland)
Triflamides and Triflimides: Synthesis and Applications,"© 2022 by the authors.Among the variety of sulfonamides, triflamides (CF3SO2NHR, TfNHR) occupy a special position in organic chemistry. Triflamides are widely used as reagents, efficient catalysts or additives in numerous reactions. The reasons for the widespread use of these compounds are their high NH-acidity, lipophilicity, catalytic activity and specific chemical properties. Their strong electron-withdrawing properties and low nucleophilicity, combined with their high NH-acidity, makes it possible to use triflamides in a vast variety of organic reactions. This review is devoted to the synthesis and use of N-trifluoromethanesulfonyl derivatives in organic chemistry, medicine, biochemistry, catalysis and agriculture. Part of the work is a review of areas and examples of the use of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (triflimide, (CF3SO2)2NH, Tf2NH). Being one of the strongest NH-acids, triflimide, and especially its salts, are widely used as catalysts in cycloaddition reactions, Friedel–Crafts reactions, condensation reactions, heterocyclization and many others. Triflamides act as a source of nitrogen in C-amination (sulfonamidation) reactions, the products of which are useful building blocks in organic synthesis, catalysts and ligands in metal complex catalysis, and have found applications in medicine. The addition reactions of triflamide in the presence of oxidizing agents to alkenes and dienes are considered separately.",Molecules

The obtained Pt and polyoxometalate (POM)–loaded COF complex (POM–Pt@COF–TB) exhibited excellent oxidation of methane. In addition, the resultant Co/Fe–based COF composites achieved great performance in an electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared with Co–modified COFs (Co@COF–TB), the optimized bimetallic modified COF composites (Co0.75Fe0.25@COF–TB) exhibited great performance for electrocatalytic OER activity, showing a lower overpotential of 331 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, Co0.75Fe0.25@COF–TB also possessed a great turnover frequency (TOF) value (0.119 s−1) at the overpotential of 330 mV, which exhibited high efficiency in the utilization of metal atoms and was better than that of many reported COF-based OER electrocatalysts.

Hydroxy-Modified Hierarchical Porous Na-CoOx/CN Material for Low-Concentration High-Throughput Formaldehyde Oxidation at Room Temperature,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Engineering the pore structure and surface properties of the catalyst are the key to realizing the highly efficient conversion of low-concentration and high-throughput formaldehyde at room temperature. Herein, alkali-modified hierarchical porous Na-CoOx/CN material was prepared using a novel freeze-drying-pyrolysis method by employing super absorbent resin/MOF composites as templates, which generate mesopores distributed in a narrow region of 6∼20 nm and abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface by alkali-modification. At room temperature, the Na-CoOx/CN material exhibited full conversion of low concentration (1.0 mg/m3) and high throughput (240,000 mL/(gcat h)) formaldehyde while also demonstrating outstanding catalytic stability under a even higher space velocity (480,000 mL/(gcat h)). In situ DRIFTS characterization revealed that the hydroxyl groups on the catalyst‘s surface could be consumed by oxidizing formaldehyde to intermediate species (carbonate, hydrocarbonate), which were then regenerated by Na+ and CO32−, contributing to the cycle of the reaction path.",ChemPlusChem
Unraveling the Anchoring Effect of MXene-Supported Single Atoms as Cathodes for Aluminum-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 ACS Materials Letters. All right reserved.As an alternative energy storage system, the stable cycle and high-rate performance of aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) batteries are increasingly affected by the dissolution of intermediate Al polysulfide (Al2Sn) into the electrolyte. Introducing anchoring materials that can promote Al2Snconversion is an effective way to solve this problem. However, the lack of an interaction mechanism between Al2Snand anchoring materials hinders the design of anchoring materials. Here, we used single-atom-loaded MXene (SA@MXene) as a representative anchoring material to systematically investigate the binding strength between SA@MXene and Al2Sn, the sulfur reduction process on MXene, and their geometric configurations, stabilities, and electronic structures. We evaluated the reaction activity of the various SA@MXene nanosheets and discovered four high-performance cathode candidates for Al-S batteries (SA = Y, Nb, Mo, Tc) with a minimum reaction energy barrier of 0.23 eV. Importantly, to unravel the interaction mechanism between Al2Snand the anchoring material, we proposed an activity volcano by consolidating the decisive S8*, Al2S8*, and Al2S12∗ binding strengths, which provides a significant roadmap for designing cathodes for Al-S batteries. The proposed study of the Al-S conversion process will benefit the understanding of sulfur chemistry and provide valuable inspiration for the design of other catalytic reaction processes.",ACS Materials Letters
Boosting the Rate Performance of Li–S Batteries via Highly Dispersed Cobalt Nanoparticles Embedded into Nitrogen-Doped Hierarchical Porous Carbon,"© 2022 CCS Chemistry. All rights reserved.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are one of the most promising alternatives to lithium–ion batteries because of the advantageous high energy density and low cost. However, the practical applications of Li–S batteries are hampered by a severe shuttle effect and sluggish polysulfide redox conversion. Herein, highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles (∼0.8 wt %) embedded into nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon (Co@N-HPC) are designed as an effective electrocatalyst for Li–S batteries, which exhibit a synergistic effect of anchoring and dual-directional catalytic conversion of polysulfides. The experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Co@N-HPC not only provides strong chemical affinity to polysulfides but also lowers the Li+ diffusion barrier and facilitates the precipitation and decomposition of Li2S, thus effectively inhibiting the shuttle effect and promoting the reaction kinetics of polysulfides. In addition, the well-dispersed Co nanoparticles in the three-dimensional carbon matrix guarantee the exposure of abundant polysulfide confining sites and catalytically active sites. Accordingly, the Li–S batteries assembled with Co@N-HPC functional separators harvest a high rate performance (808.4 mAh g−1 at 10 C), a long-lasting cycle stability (0.055% decay per cycle over 1000 cycles at 4 C), and a superior areal capacity retention (5.78 mAh cm−2 after 100 cycles with a high sulfur loading of 7 mg cm−2).",CCS Chemistry

Atomically-Dispersed Fe-N4 on 3D Hierarchical Porous Carbon for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Battery,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium-sulfur (Li−S) battery with the advantages of high theoretical capacity and low cost is a promising technology for advanced energy storage. However, poor conductivity of the sulfur cathode, huge volume expansion, shuttling effect and sluggish catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfide hinder its commercialization. Herein, a 3D hierarchical porous carbon loaded with atomically dispersed Fe-N4 was developed as a sulfur cathode, which not only offers enhanced electronic conductivity, but also alleviates volume expansion. Moreover, density functional theory calculation results suggest that the Fe-N4 sites are favorable to enhance the diffusion and promote the conversion of lithium polysulfide. Consequently, lithium-sulfur battery with 3D hierarchical porous carbon as the sulfur cathode exhibit good capacity and cycling performance, where a high initial specific capacity of 1289.3 mAh g−1 can be delivered at 0.1 C, and a capacity loss of only 0.025 % per cycle can be achieved for 1000 cycles at 2.0 C.",Batteries and Supercaps
"Transition Metal (Co, Ni, Fe, Cu) Single-Atom Catalysts Anchored on 3D Nitrogen-Doped Porous Carbon Nanosheets as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts for Zn–Air Battery","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Exploring highly active and cost-efficient single-atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical for the large-scale application of Zn–air battery. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that the intrinsic ORR activity of the active metal of SACs follows the trend of Co > Fe > Ni ≈ Cu, in which Co SACs possess the best ORR activity due to its optimized spin density. Guided by DFT calculations, four kinds of transition metal single atoms embedded in 3D porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (MSAs@PNCN, M = Co, Ni, Fe, Cu) are synthesized via a facile NaCl-template assisted strategy. The resulting MSAs@PNCN displays ORR activity trend in lines with the theoretical predictions, and the Co SAs@PNCN exhibits the best ORR activity (E1/2 = 0.851 V), being comparable to that of Pt/C under alkaline conditions. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra verify the atomically dispersed Co-N4 sites are the catalytically active sites. The highly active CoN4 sites and the unique 3D porous structure contribute to the outstanding ORR performance of Co SAs@PNCN. Furthermore, the Co SAs@PNCN catalyst is employed as cathode in Zn–air battery, which can deliver a large power density of 220 mW cm–2 and maintain robust cycling stability over 530 cycles.",Small

Compared to the corresponding individual phases such as δ-MnO2@SSM and Fe2O3@SSM, δ-MnO2/Fe2O3@SSM delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1821 mAh g−1, and retain 1464 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 200 mA g−1, moreover, about 1135 mAh g−1 can still be achieved at 2.0 A g−1 after 500 cycles, demonstrating excellent long-term cycling performance. Furthermore, the composite demonstrates superior rate capability as well, about 503 mAh g−1 can be remained at a high current density of up to 10 A g−1.

Engineering fluoride-rich interphase and inhibiting grain coarsening for highly reversible bismuth sulfide anode for sodium storage,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdBismuth sulfide is considered as a promising anode material for sodium-ion battery due to the high theoretical capacity originates from conversion and alloying reaction. However, large volume expansion during cycling, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and poor reaction reversibility limit its practical application. Herein, taking Bi2S3 nanorods as example, we first investigated the capacity fading mechanism of Bi2S3 nanorods in electrolytes with different composition and revealed that although ether electrolyte could improve the reversibility, the coarsening of bismuth during cycling is the culprit to the capacity fading. Then, a tailored two-pronged approach including carbon coating and Fe-doping was proposed to induce F-rich SEI and inhibit grain coarsening during cycling. As a result, the optimized electrode exhibited enhanced low-plateau alloying reaction and a high specific capacity as 382 mA h/g, which is in sharp contrast to 180 mA h/g of pure Bi2S3 which dominated by high-plateau conversion reaction. In addition, high-capacity retention as 76% could be maintained even at 10 A/g due to the enhanced reaction kinetics by Fe-doping. Thanks to the stable SEI and enhanced reversibility, full cell with high energy density as 156 W h/kg could be achieved without any pre-sodiation or assistant from complex nanostructure.",Materials Today Energy

The champion carbon sample gave a high phenol yield of 13.4%. The catalyst was facilely recovered and reused without apparent deactivation. There abundant oxygen functional groups such as phenolic and quinone carbonyl groups served as the active sites and polyfuran units accelerated the O2 adsorption and activation.

The Pt-SA@HG exhibits unexpected electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances with 13 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 current densities which surpass Pt-Clu@HG and Pt-Nc@HG. The in situ X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations determine the Pt-C3 active site is linchpin to the excellent HER performance of Pt-SA@HG.

Graphene and carbon structures and nanomaterials for energy storage,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.There is enormous interest in the use of graphene-based materials for energy storage. This article discusses the progress that has been accomplished in the development of chemical, electrochemical, and electrical energy storage systems using graphene. We summarize the theoretical and experimental work on graphene-based hydrogen storage systems, lithium batteries, and supercapacitors. Graphene could also be a two-dimensional (2D) sheet of carbon atoms in a very hexagonal (honeycomb) configuration. The carbon atoms in graphene are bonded with the SP2 hybrid. Graphene is the most recent member of the multidimensional graphite carbon family of materials. This family includes fullerene as zero-dimensional (0D) nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes as one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials, and graphite as a three-dimensional (3D) material. The term graphene was first coined in 1986 to form the word graphite and a suffix (s) per polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Additionally, to monolayer and bilayer graphene, graphene layers from 3 to 10 layers are called few-layer graphene and between 10 and 30 layers are called multiplayer graphene, thick graphene, or nanocrystals. Graphene is typically expected to contain only one layer, but there is considerable interest in researching bilayer and low-layer graphene. There are several methods for producing graphene, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Graphene-based materials have great potential to be employed in supercapacitors due to their unique two-dimensional structure and inherent physical properties like excellent electrical conductivity and large area. This text summarizes recent developments within the sector of supercapacitors, including double-layer capacitors and quasi-capacitors. The pros and cons of using them in supercapacitors are discussed. Compared to traditional electrodes, graphene-based materials show some new properties and mechanisms within the method of energy storage and release. During this paper, we briefly describe carbon structures, particularly graphene, and also the history of graphene discovery, and briefly describe the synthesis methods, properties, characterization methods, and applications of graphene.",Applied Physics A: Materials Science and Processing
High-performance prelithiated Si-S full cell enabled by trifluorobenzene modified diluted high-concentration electrolyte,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSilicon-sulfur (Si-S) full cells show significant potential in energy storage due to their high theoretical energy density compared to commercial lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, a majority of electrolytes reported for Si-S full cells still cannot meet the requirements of stable long-duration cycling. Herein, we report a high-areal-capacity Si-S full cell consisted with prelithiated SiO, thick Li2S-Se0.05S0.95@pPAN electrode and a trifluorobenzene (F3B) modified and diluted high-concentration electrolytes.

The series of bimetallic CoxM3-x(HITP)2 MOFs exhibit ultrathin graphene-like nanostructure, highly d–π conjugated network, large specific surface areas, and diverse metal coordination modes.

Engineering Nonprecious Metal Oxides Electrocatalysts for Two-Electron Water Oxidation to H2O2,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a valuable chemical oxidant which has been extensively applied in water treatment, textile/paper bleaching, medical disinfection, and other industrial fields. Electrocatalytic two-electron water oxidation reaction (2e-WOR) with renewable energy inputs is an attractive route to produce H2O2, which avoids the energy-intensive anthraquinone process in industry. However, leveraging these advances requires the development of efficient and selective electrocatalysts to accelerate the sluggish kinetics. In particular, nanostructured engineering of nonprecious metal oxides offers a promising route for 2e-WOR. In this review, the recent progress on nanostructure engineering of various nonprecious metal oxides electrocatalysts for 2e-WOR is reviewed, along with remarks on the challenges and perspectives. The fundamental understanding of 2e-WOR by density functional theory calculations and operando characterizations is first given, followed by a discussion of diverse H2O2 quantification methods including ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry, titration, and colorimetric strips, with special emphasis on their accuracy, detection limit and stability.

"The role of carbon allotropes on the radiation resistance of Cu-based nanocomposites: An atomistic, energetic, and thermodynamic perspective","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Carbon allotropes can be considered as an excellent radiation resistance enhancer in metal-Graphene nanocomposites (NCs). Many research groups studied the radiation resistance and interface stability of metal-Graphene NCs and revealed that Graphene can improve the radiation resistance of NCs under irradiation. Other allotropes of carbon have not been studied up to now. Therefore, in this work, four Cu-based NCs such as Cu-Graphene, Cu-Graphyne, Cu-Graphdiyne, and Cu-Graphane were studied by molecular dynamics (MD) to understand the role of carbon allotropes on the radiation resistance of Cu-based NCs. Compared with pure copper; four Cu-based NCs have fewer residual defects in the bulk region after irradiation. The results demonstrated that the interface of these NCs acts as a sink for radiation-induced defects, and preferentially traps interstitials over vacancies. The results of energetic calculations indicate the defect formation energy is reduced in the vicinity of interface regions. Compared with Cu-Graphyne and Cu-Graphdiyne, Cu-Graphene and Cu-Graphane have low segregation energy for interstitial emission mechanism to annihilate vacancies. Also, Cu/Graphane/Cu interface has a higher strength of interaction and attraction with vacancies due to the low value of vacancy formation energy (Evac). Thermodynamic and structural analyses reveal that Graphdiyne plane isn't a stable plane during collision cascades.

The anchoring effect of Nb-based MXenes lithium-sulfur batteries: A first-principles study,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe dissolution and diffusion of S-species in the electrolyte are one of the most important reasons affecting the development of lithium-sulfur batteries. MXenes, a two-dimensional material which has received a lot of attention recently, is investigated in lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries due to its excellent properties. Most of the current reports focus on Ti-based MXenes materials, while there are few studies on Nb-based MXenes materials. In this paper, the interactions between lithium polysulfide and Nb2C-MXenes as well as O-functionalization (Nb2CO2 and Nb3C2O2) and S-functionalization (Nb2CS2 and Nb3C2S2) are investigated by using density functional theory calculations (DFT). According to the calculated results, both O-functionalized and S-functionalized have sufficiently large adsorption energy to inhibit the shuttle effect which occurs during the cycling of Li–S battery. As a comparison, O-functionalized MXenes have a more suitable adsorption energy for Li–S battery cathode materials, while S-functionalized MXenes have a lower ion diffusion potential barrier. In addition, all studied materials retain their original metallic properties after adsorption of lithium polysulfide, which contributes significantly to the electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries during charging and discharging. The results may be useful for investigating high-performance storage materials with Nb-based MXene materials.",Micro and Nanostructures
Bipolar magnetic semiconductors and half-metals in transition metals doped SnSe2 zigzag nanoribbons,"© 2022 The Author(s)The magnetic and electronic properties of transition metals (TM) (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) doped SnSe2 zigzag nanoribbons (ZNRs) are investigated by employing density functional theory. When an Sn atom on edge of ZNR is substituted by Sc atom, the ZNR behaves as bipolar magnetic semiconductors with 100% spin polarization of valence band and conduction band carriers, where the spin-polarization direction can easily be switched by an external electric field. The Cr-doped ZNR is a spin-gapless semiconductor in which the valence band and conduction band in the spin-up channel touch each other at Fermi energy. The others either are usual magnetic semiconductors or nonmagnetic semiconductors. When two Sn atoms on the edge are substituted by Cr atoms, it is observed that the SnSe2 nanoribbon exhibits half-metallic behavior. Either one Cr dopant or two Cr dopants on edge, the nanoribbons have stable 100% spin polarization of conduction carriers at a wide energy range. These findings demonstrate that the Sc-, Cr-, and 2Cr-doped SnSe2 zigzag nanoribbons are excellent candidates for spintronics.",Results in Physics

Biotemplating synthesis of organized structures inspired by biological processes,"© 2022 The Author(s)The hierarchical structures of biological materials endow them with excellent mechanical performance and specific functionality. Interestingly, structures are formed under the functions of biological systems under mild conditions, which inspires the synthesis and fabrication of artificial materials at room temperature. During the formation of biological structures, biotemplating effects play critical roles, such as confined environments, surface functional groups, molecular conformation, and self-assembly behavior. Based on these functional characteristics, many studies have focused on choosing biological templates that are abundant in nature and easy to obtain or to design customized biological templates based on pristine biotemplates to realize the formation of organized structures and the optimized performance of materials. In this review, we summarize the four types of biotemplates, including collagen, cellulose, viruses, and bacteria, for the synthesis of organized structures.

Single Mo–N4 Atomic Sites Anchored on N-doped Carbon Nanoflowers as Sulfur Host with Multiple Immobilization and Catalytic Effects for High-Performance Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Rational design of sulfur hosts for effectively confining lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and optimizing the sluggish sulfur kinetics is still a major challenge in lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). In this work, a simple strategy of introducing single Mo–N4 atoms into N-doped carbon nano-flower matrix (Mo-N-CNF) as sulfur host cathode materials is developed to realize high-performance LSBs. These single Mo–N4 atoms have been demonstrated to regulate the hydrophilic nature, Li-ion diffusion, adsorption capacity, and catalytic conversion of polysulfides via experimental evidences and theoretical calculations. The resulting Mo-N-CNF with high loading content of sulfur (>72 wt.%) exhibits a high specific capacity (1248 mAh g–1 at 0.2 C) and excellent rate capability (715 mAh g–1 at 5 C). More importantly, the outstanding cycling performance with a low attenuation rate of only 0.004% per cycle over 400 cycles at 4.27 mA cm–2 is achieved with the area sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm–2. This work demonstrates a viable strategy for using single atoms-based carbon materials with high exposed sites as multiple captors for LiPS and an efficient accelerator for sulfur redox kinetics toward next-generation LSBs with boosted electrochemical performance.",Advanced Functional Materials
Interface engineering of Zn meal anodes using electrochemically inert Al2O3 protective nanocoatings,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Aqueous rechargeable Zn-ion batteries are regarded as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries owing to their high energy density, low cost, and high safety. However, their commercialization is severely restricted by the Zn dendrite formation and side reactions. Herein, we propose that these issues can be minimized by modifying the interfacial properties through introducing electrochemically inert Al2O3 nanocoatings on Zn meal anodes (Al2O3@Zn). The Al2O3 nanocoatings can effectively suppress both the dendrite growth and side reactions. As a result, the Al2O3@Zn symmetric cells show excellent electrochemical performance with a long lifespan of more than 4,000 h at 1 mA·cm−2 and 1 mAh·cm−2. Meanwhile, the assembled Al2O3@Zn//V2O5 full cells can deliver a high capacity (236.2 mAh·g−1) and long lifespan with a capacity retention of 76.11% after 1,000 cycles at 4 A·g−1.

Preparation and characterization of high-stability lithium ion-sieves with aluminosilicate framework,"© 2022The ion exchange adsorption method is the most promising technique for lithium recovery from low-grade brines, and the main adsorbents are titanium-based and manganese-based ion-sieves. Their expensive cost and poor cycling performance, which have limited their industrial applications, need to be solved fundamentally by finding a new ion-sieve. Hence, in this work, a high-stability and low-priced lithium ion-sieve with aluminosilicate framework was successfully synthesized by solid-phase sintering. The cheap silicon and aluminum raw materials make this ion-sieve have a low synthesis cost. The adsorption behavior of ion-sieves fits the Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order kinetics, indicating that the adsorption of lithium is mainly monolayer adsorption, and the process is chemisorption. After ten cycles, the lithium adsorption capacity is still over 27 mg/g. Moreover, it can recover lithium in the brine of West Taijinar Salt Lake in China even at 160 °C due to the excellent stability of the aluminosilicate framework, which can effectively improve its industrial production efficiency. Therefore, it has great potential to extract lithium from liquid lithium resources with a high Mg/Li ratio.",Hydrometallurgy
Mn2NO2 MXene as a promising anode material for metal ion batteries: A first-principles study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Two-dimensional material, MXene, is useful as the electrode for ion batteries because of high conductivity and predominantly active two-dimensional surface. Nevertheless, only a few studies have reported the use of magnetic MXene as electrode materials, especially MXene containing transition metal Mn. Recently, a new MXene member Mn2NO2 with superior magnetic half-metallic properties has been proposed. In this study, we use the first-principles calculations to study the performance of the single-layer Mn2NO2 as the anode of Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and Al3+ ion batteries. The calculation results show that Mn2NO2 has low diffusion barrier, low open circuit voltage (OCV) and high ion adsorption capacity, which enable its use as anode of the ion batteries. Above all, Mn2NO2 exhibits an excellent Mg2+ adsorption capacity (1374.41 mAhg−1) with stable structure. The capacitance content is also expected to break through the currently available Mg2+ion batteries.

Here, we have shown the design of few-layered, ultrashort Ni-Mo-S slabs dispersed on reduced graphene oxide (Ni-Mo-S/rGO-A) based on anchoring [PMo12O40]3− clusters and Ni2+ on polyethyleneimine (PEI)-modified graphite oxide. Structural characterizations (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), etc.) show that Ni-Mo-S slabs with predominant monolayer and partial substitution of edge Mo atoms by isolated Ni atoms have rich accessible edge Ni-Mo-S sites and high sulfurization degree. All virtues endow it with plentiful edge-active sites, and consequently, the enhanced performance for hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT). The hydrodesulfurization proceeds via a more-favorable direct desulfurization (DDS) route with a reaction rate constant (kHDS) of 48.6 × 10−7 mol·g−1·s−1 over Ni-Mo-S/rGO-A catalyst, which is 4.3 times greater than that over traditional Ni-Mo-S/Al2O3 catalyst and at the forefront of reported catalysts.

Great efforts have been devoted to developing verified anode materials. Carbon materials take the leading position because of their abundance, low-cost, environmental friendless, and commercial potential. While it is easy to understand which specific carbon material exhibits outstanding performance, the understanding of electrochemical reaction mechanisms, the structure–performance relation, and the interfacial properties of carbon anodes are rather difficult.

Confinement of Prussian Blue Analogs Boxes Inside Conducting Polymer Nanotubes Enables Significantly Enhanced Catalytic Performance for Water Treatment,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Tubular nanoreactor with unique void-confinement effect has captured great attention for catalytic applications but is challenging in controllable fabrication and realizing a synergistically enhanced performance. Herein, a template polymerization-guided synthetic strategy is presented to confine hollow Prussian blue analog boxes inside conducting polypyrrole nanotubes (H-CoFe PBA@PPy NTs) as efficient peroxymonosulfate activator toward catalytic oxidation of toxic organic contaminants. This delicately designed H-CoFe PBA@PPy NTs display a superior kinetic rate constant compared with the pristine CoFe PBA cubes (7.9 fold) and H-CoFe PBA boxes (22.6 fold). Experimental evidence reveals that the generation of multiple reactive oxygen species in the nanotubes plays a vital role for the significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency for dye degradation. The superior catalytic performance is attributed to the intrinsic bimetallic CoFe PBA to provide abundant active sites, distinct nanotubular structure to concentrate the reactant molecules within a confined space, and excellent electron/mass transport property.

Yet, the heterostructures with unique structures as well as the regulation of heterointerface electronic structure are still challenging for high-performance Li–S batteries. Herein, Pt single-atoms (SAs)-regulated heterostructures of In2S3/Ti3C2 binary nanosheets (Pt SAs/In2S3/Ti3C2) are facilely constructed via an ultrasound-assisted photochemical reduction strategy for dendrite-free and kinetics-enhanced Li–S batteries. The as-designed heterostructures of Pt SAs/In2S3/Ti3C2 on separator can stabilize the Li plating/striping on Li anodes even at a high current density of 5 mA cm−2. In addition, Pt SAs/In2S3/Ti3C2 heterostructure can suppress the polysulfide shuttling and exhibit excellent redox electrocatalytic properties for lithium polysulfides decomposition. The batteries with heterostructure-modified separators show a high initial discharge capacity of 1068.4 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C, excellent rate performances (719.6 mAh g−1 at 5C), and a remarkable cycling ability.

Synergistic effect of multifunctional Co3O4@C@MnO2 composite for enhancing redox kinetics toward stable lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are considered one of the most promising candidate for next-generation storage systems due to their excellent theoretical energy density. Nevertheless, the inevitable “shuttle effect” of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) leads to poor cycle stability. Herein, we report the in-situ coating MnO2 nanosheets on the Co3O4@C nanospheres (Co3O4@C@MnO2) as modified separators for LSBs. The study shows that the outer layer of MnO2 has a high affinity for LiPSs and can anchor LiPSs through strong chemical adsorption. The internal Co3O4@C has admirable catalytic activity, which can accelerate the complete conversion of LiPSs to Li2S. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between the outer layer MnO2 on the adsorption of LiPSs and the inner Co3O4@C on the catalysis of LiPSs, the cells exhibit an outstanding electrochemical performance, including high reversible capacity of 734 mAh g−1 at 1 C, a low-capacity decay rate of 0.0406% per cycle around 500 cycles.

"Modifying electronic and magnetic properties of the β-Sb monolayer by doping with III-, IV-, and V-group atoms","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of pristine and doped β-antimonene (Sb) monolayer have been investigated using first-principles calculations. Pristine β-Sb single layer has an indirect energy gap of 1.26 eV. As dopants, some III-(B, Al, and Ga), IV-(C, Si, and Ge), and V-group (N, P, and As) atoms are considered. Due to the modified electronic interactions and difference in atomic size, substitutional incorporation of foreign atoms causes a local structural distortion, which is reflected on some structural parameters including bond length, buckling height, and interatomic angle. III- and V-group dopants tune the electronic band gap of β-Sb monolayer, preserving its non magnetic nature. Meanwhile, magnetic semiconductor behavior is induced by doping with IV-group atoms, where dopants are the main contributor to the magnetic properties. Results presented herein propose efficient approaches to modify the fundamental properties of β-Sb monolayer as well as induce new features in order to make it more suitable for spintronic and optoelectronic applications.",Physica E: Low-Dimensional Systems and Nanostructures
Defect-mediated work function regulation in graphene film for high-performing triboelectric nanogenerators,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdTriboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) demonstrate an attractive pathway to directly convert broadband mechanical energy into electrical energy for a green and clean energy source. Triboelectric material design with tailored work function has played a critical role in enhancing the output performance of TENGs. However, regulating the work function of triboelectric materials still remains challenging due to the limited particle/group/ion doping rate. Here, we reported a simple defect-mediated strategy (DMS) to regulate the work function of graphene film (positive triboelectric material) by different contents of oxygen and carbon defects derived at annealing temperatures from 500 ºC to 3000 ºC. Our DMS features a continuous and wide-range tunable work function from 4.68 eV to 4.49 eV and the as-assembled TENGs produce output voltages and currents up to 190 V and 14 μA, respectively. The efficient work function regulation of this type establishes a set of fundamental considerations in triboelectric material design, especially the two-dimensional materials, to enhance the energy harvesting and sensing performances of TENGs.",Nano Energy
Tuning 4f-Center Electron Structure by Schottky Defects for Catalyzing Li Diffusion to Achieve Long-Term Dendrite-Free Lithium Metal Battery,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium metal is considered as the most prospective electrode for next-generation energy storage systems due to high capacity and the lowest potential. However, uncontrollable spatial growth of lithium dendrites and the crack of solid electrolyte interphase still hinder its application. Herein, Schottky defects are motivated to tune the 4f-center electronic structures of catalysts to provide active sites to accelerate Li transport kinetics. As experimentally and theoretically confirmed, the electronic density is redistributed and affected by the Schottky defects, offering numerous active catalytic centers with stronger ion diffusion capability to guide the horizontal lithium deposition against dendrite growth. Consequently, the Li electrode with artificial electronic-modulation layer remarkably decreases the barriers of desolvation, nucleation, and diffusion, extends the dendrite-free plating lifespan up to 1200 h, and improves reversible Coulombic efficiency. With a simultaneous catalytic effect on the conversions of sulfur species at the cathodic side, the integrated Li–S full battery exhibits superior rate performance of 653 mA h g−1 at 5 C, high long-life capacity retention of 81.4% at 3 C, and a high energy density of 2264 W h kg−1 based on sulfur in a pouch cell, showing the promising potential toward high-safety and long-cycling lithium metal batteries.",Advanced Science
Electrocatalyst Modulation toward Bidirectional Sulfur Redox in Li–S Batteries: From Strategic Probing to Mechanistic Understanding,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Electrocatalyst design has stimulated considerable attention and strenuous effort to tackle a multitude of detrimental issues in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) systems, mainly pertaining to the severe polysulfide shuttle effect and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. In this context related advances in expediting bidirectional sulfur reactions have lately surged.

"Engineering electrophilic atomic Ir sites on CeO2 colloidal spheres for selectivity control in hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds","© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond in α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds is rather challenging owing to the more feasible hydrogenation of ethylenic bond from both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. Here, we demonstrate a facile emulsion-based molecule-nanoparticle self-assembly strategy for the atomic engineering of Ir species on three-dimensional CeO2 spheres (Ir1@CeO2). When applied to the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, Ir1@CeO2 catalyst remarkably exhibited ~ 100% selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols, whereas the formation of Ir nanoparticles on CeO2 drastically decreased the selectivity for unsaturated alcohols. Spectroscopic studies revealed that strong metal—support interactions triggered the charge transfer from Ir to CeO2, leading to the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ along with the formation new Irδ+—O2−—Ce3+(OV) interfaces. The electrophilic atomic Ir species at the Irδ+—O2−—Ce3+ (OV) interfaces would therefore preferentially adsorb and facilitate hydrogenation of polar C=O bond to achieve exceptional selectivity.

Discovery of Dual-Functional Amorphous Titanium Suboxide to Promote Polysulfide Adsorption and Regulate Sulfide Growth in Li–S Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries are promising as next-generation energy storage systems. Adsorbents for sulfide species are favorably applied to the cathode, but this substrate often results in a surface-passivating lithium sulfide(Li2S) film with a strong adsorption of Li2S. Here, an amorphous titanium suboxide (a-TiOx) is presented that strongly adsorbs lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx, x < 6) but relatively weakly adsorbs to Li2S. With these characteristics, the a-TiOx achieves high conversion of Li2Sx and high sulfur utilization accompanying the growth of particulate Li2S. The DFT calculations present a mechanism for particulate growth driven by the promoted diffusion and favorable clustering of Li2S. The a-TiOx-coated carbon nanotube-assembled film (CNTF) cathode substrate cell achieves a high discharge capacity equivalent to 90% sulfur utilization at 0.2 C. The cell also delivers a high capacity of 850 mAh g–1 even at the ultra-high-speed of 10 C and also exhibits high stability of capacity loss of 0.0226% per cycle up to 500 cycles.

Mo-O-C Between MoS2 and Graphene Toward Accelerated Polysulfide Catalytic Conversion for Advanced Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.MoS2/C composites constructed with van der Waals forces have been extensively applied in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. However, the catalytic conversion effect on polysulfides is limited because the weak electronic interactions between the composite interfaces cannot fundamentally improve the intrinsic electronic conductivity of MoS2. Herein, density functional theory calculations reveal that the MoS2 and nitrogen-doped carbon composite with an Mo–O–C bond can promote the catalytic conversion of polysulfides with a Gibbs free energy of only 0.19 eV and a low dissociation energy barrier of 0.48 eV, owing to the strong covalent coupling effect on the heterogeneous interface. Guided by theoretical calculations, a robust MoS2 strongly coupled with a 3D carbon matrix composed of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide and carbonized melamine foam is designed and constructed as a multifunctional coating layer for lithium–sulfur batteries. As a result, excellent electrochemical performance is achieved for Li–S batteries, with a capacity of 615 mAh g–1 at 5 C, an areal capacity of 6.11 mAh cm–2, and a low self-discharge of only 8.6% by resting for five days at 0.5 C. This study opens a new avenue for designing 2D material composites toward promoted catalytic conversion of polysulfides.",Advanced Science
High-density/efficient surface active sites on modified separators to boost Li-S batteries via atomic Co3+-Se termination,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Various and critical electrocatalytic processes are involved during the redox reactions in the Li-S batteries, which extremely depend on the surface structure and chemical state. Recently, single-atom concept unlocks a route to maximize the use of surface-active atoms, however, further increasing the density of active site is still strictly limited by the inherent structure that single-atoms are only highly-dispersed on substrate. Herein, we provide a viewpoint that an elaborate facet design with single-crystalline structure engineering can harvest high-density surface active sites, which can significantly boost the electrocatalyst performance for excellent Li-S batteries. Specifically, the single-crystal CoSe2 (scCS) exhibits three-types of terminated (011) facet, efficiently obtaining the surface with a high-rich Co3+—Se bond termination, in contrast with lots of surface grain boundaries and dangling bonds in polycrystalline CoSe2. Surprisingly, the surface active sites concentration can reach more than 69%. As anticipated, it can provide high-density and high-efficient active sites, enormously suppressing the shuttle effect and improving the reaction kinetics via accelerating the conversion and deposition of polysulfides and Li2S. This surface lattice strategy with element terminated mode is a promising approach for designing electrocatalyst effect-based energy system, not merely for Li-S batteries.

Manifestation of interface-induced effects of two-dimensional MSi2/Si(111) quantum heterostructures: A first principles study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal/semiconductor (M/S) heterojunctions play key role in the materials physics as well as electronic device applications. This is because of several interface-induced properties like formation of Schottky barrier height (SBH), Fermi level pinning, evolution of metal-induced gap states (MIGS) etc. The overall device performance crucially depends on the electronic structure as well as the geometry of the interface. The transition metal disilicides (MSi2) are essential parts of the silicon-based devices. MSi2/Si(111) (M = Ni, Co) systems serve as ideal lattice matched epitaxial M/S heterojunctions to investigate several interface-induced effects. Such a sharp and abrupt lattice matched interface provides an ideal rectifying junction for realization of MIGS and formation of SBH. Depending on the orientation of MSi2 overlayer with respect to the Si(111) substrate, two types of interfaces can be formed, viz. A-type and B-type. In the present work, we have used first principles density functional theory (DFT) based computational approach, to investigate structure-property relationships at the MSi2/Si(111) interface.

Nitrogen-rich azoles as trifunctional electrolyte additives for high-performance lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022Rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered one of the most promising energy storage techniques owing to the high theoretical energy density. However, challenges still remain such as the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LPSs) and the instability of lithium metal anode. Herein, we propose to use nitrogen-rich azoles, i.e., triazole (Ta) and tetrazole (Tta), as trifunctional electrolyte additives for Li-S batteries. The azoles afford strong lithiophilicity for the chemisorption of LPSs. The density functional theory and experimental analysis verify the presence of Li bonds between the azoles and LPSs. The azoles can also interact with lithium salt in the electrolyte, leading to increase ionic conductivity and lithium-ion transference number. Moreover, the azoles render particle-like lithium deposition on the lithium metal anode, leading to superlong cycling of a Li symmetric cell. The Li-S batteries with Ta and Tta exhibit the initial discharge capacity of 1425.5 and 1322.2 mAh g−1, respectively, at 0.2C rate, and promising cycling stability. They also enable enhanced cycling performance of a Li-organosulfide battery.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Biomimetic copper single-atom nanozyme system for self-enhanced nanocatalytic tumor therapy,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Single-atom nanozymes (SAZs) with peroxidase (POD)-like activity have good nanocatalytic tumor therapy (NCT) capabilities. However, insufficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydrogen ions in the cells limit their therapeutic effects. Herein, to overcome these limitations, a biomimetic single-atom nanozyme system was developed for self-enhanced NCT. We used a previously described approach to produce platelet membrane vesicles. Using a high-temperature carbonization approach, copper SAZs with excellent POD-like activity were successfully synthesized. Finally, through physical extrusion, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI; pantoprazole sodium) and the SAZs were combined with platelet membrane vesicles to create PPS. Both in vivo and in vitro, PPS displayed good tumor-targeting and accumulation abilities. PPIs were able to simultaneously regulate the hydrogen ion, glutathione (GSH), and H2O2 content in tumor cells, significantly improve the catalytic ability of SAZs, and achieve self-enhanced NCT. Our in vivo studies showed that PPS had a tumor suppression rate of > 90%. PPS also limited the synthesis of GSH in cells at the source; thus, glutamine metabolism therapy and NCT were integrated into an innovative method, which provides a novel strategy for multimodal tumor therapy.

Tremendous progress has been made in the catalyst development for these two reactions, which is critical to improve the utilization efficiency of the inert CO2. Whereas, catalyst design strategies for these two reactions have not been systematically discussed. Therefore, here, design strategies such as increasing sintering resistance, enhancing redox property, basicity, and porosity etc. for structured catalysts including core/yolk shell, perovskite and spinel catalyst for DRM are analysed. In addition, CRR catalyst design measures from both atomic-, molecular- and meso-scale for instance tuning of electronic structure, size, morphology, and porosity to increase the syngas selectivity are compared. Finally, challenges and future work of these two reactions are proposed. Some of the challenges and solutions include (1) facile large scale synthesis strategies are highly desired to design multifunctional catalysts with low mass transfer resistance in addition to silica-based and noble-metal based catalysts; (2) mechanism illustration of confinement effect, synergistic effect, and intermediate species are crucial and feasible aided with various in situ characterization techniques; (3) more stringent reaction conditions are required to boost their industrial process of these two reactions.

It is expected that this short review would contribute to the development of COFs materials in energy-related applications.",Journal of Polymer Science
Atomically dispersed transition metal-N4 doped graphene as a LixOy nucleation site in nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries,"© 2022Focusing on the catalytic mechanism of graphene with the atomically dispersed transition metal-N4 dispersed in nonaqueous lithium-oxygen battery, the adsorption models of key intermediates LixOy on the TM-N4 doped graphene surface are established by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The nucleation and decomposition processes of Li2O2 are elucidated. Both of the charge transfer and electronic hybridization between TM-3d and O-2p orbitals influence the adsorption energies of key intermediates LixOy on the TM-N4 doped graphene surface. A greater adsorption energy usually corresponds to a greater TM atomic number. The adsorption energies of LiO2, Li3O4 and Li4O4 are the linear functions of the adsorption energy of Li2O2. The initial ORR processes on the Mn-N4, Fe-N4, Co-N4 doped graphene surfaces follow the two-electron reaction pathway, while the initial ORR processes on the Ni-N4 and Cu-N4 doped graphene surfaces might follow both of the two-electron and four-electron reaction pathways. The Co-N4 doped graphene possesses the overpotentials of 0.69 V for ORR and 0.92 V for OER, showing the optimal catalytic activity.",Electrochimica Acta
Rich 1T-MoS2 Nanoflowers Decorated on Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanosheet for Ultra-Quick Zn2+ Storage,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) with low cost and high safety are promising energy storage equipment for large-scale grids. However, the further development of AZIBs is obstructed by finite usability of cathode materials. Recently, layered materials represented by MoS2 have attracted attentions because they can provide facile two-dimensional (2D) channels for the diffusion of Zn2+, but low capacity and poor rate capability limit their applications. Herein, two classical layered materials are combined to form a stable heterostructure (MoS2-rGO) by in-situ growing metallic 1T-MoS2 nanoflowers on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to provide more 2D channels for electrons transfer and Zn2+ diffusion. The MoS2-rGO heterostructure exhibits high specific capacity (303.10 mAh g−1 at 0.20 A g−1) and ultrahigh rate capability (102.70 mAh g−1 at 20.00 A g−1, i. e., capacity retention of 33.88 % for a 100-fold increase in current density) in aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, the quasi-solid-state aqueous zinc-ion battery based on MoS2-rGO heterostructure also shows high electrochemical performance at bending states and extreme temperature. This work provides an inspiration for construction of AZIBs with high-performance layered cathode.",Batteries and Supercaps
Constructing stable Li-solid electrolyte interphase to achieve dendrites-free solid-state battery: A nano-interlayer/Li pre-reduction strategy,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Solid-state batteries based on Li and nonflammable solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have aroused the attention of numerous researchers because of their absolute safety and potentially high energy density. Most SSEs after coming into contact with Li are reduced, which leads to high interfacial charge-transfer impedance and dendrites formation. In this study, an “interlayer-Li pre-reduction strategy” was proposed to solve the above problem of reduction. An intermediate layer was introduced between solid electrolyte and Li, and it reacted with Li to produce a stable and ion-conductive interphase. Cubic garnet-type Nb-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Nb-LLZO) was selected as an example solid electrolyte since it is characterized by high ionic conductivity, feasible preparation under ambient conditions, as well as low cost. The high impedance arising from the reduction at the Nb-LLZO∣Li interface has limited its application. In this paper, a nano-scale Li phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) layer was deposited on the Nb-LLZO pellets through radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, which pre-reacted with Li in-situ to produce a lithiophilic, electronically insulating, and ionic conductive interphase. The produced interphase significantly inhibited the reduction of Nb5+ against Li and the formation and propagation of Li dendrites. It is noteworthy that Li∣LiPON∣Nb-LLZO∣LiPON∣Li cells stably cycled for over 2,000 h without any short circuit. This study emphasizes and demonstrates the significance of the pre-conversion of modification layer between unstable SSE and Li metal to improve interfacial stability.

Insight into the Effect of Iodine Doping Soft Carbon and Iodine Functional Separator for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Doping carbonaceous materials are regarded as prospective cathode candidates for high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li−S) batteries. In this study, we construct a dual functional modification system, including iodine-doped soft carbon (I-SC) and iodine functional separator for Li−S batteries. The formation of C−I bonds in the carbon skeleton increases the carbon interlayer spacing and displays a powerful chemical adsorption ability and electrocatalytic activity for polysulfide conversion. In addition, semi-hollow micro-rods-structure soft carbon not only accommodates the volume expansion of sulfur, but also provides a continuous conductive network to transport Li+ and electrons over cycling. Furthermore, by assisting with polyiodide (e. g., I3− and I5−) modified separator, the polysulfide migration can be further controlled, resulting in a high capacity of 956 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C after 300 cycles. This work represents the importance of I-doping and provides the potential of soft carbon for low-cost and scalable fabrication of energy storage systems.",Batteries and Supercaps

Herein, we report a novel bimetallic-ion co-exchange combined pyrolysis strategy using bio-MOF-1 as the self-template to synthesize NiCo nanoalloy-Co-N4 embedded hierarchical porous carbon (CoNi-CoN4-HPC-900), which endows good electrical conductivity, large surface area and rich highly-dispersed CoNi-CoN4 active sites identified from X-ray absorption spectroscopy, resulting in outstanding electrocatalytic activity for both ORR and OER in alkaline solution. In situ Raman spectroscopy testifys that the electrocatalytic processes occur via the redox of Co(Ni)(II and Ⅲ) species. Density functional theory calculations are performed to study the ORR and OER activity on the CoNi-CoN4 and CoN4 active sites. The CoNi-CoN4-HPC-900 endows a flexible rechargeable Zn-air battery with an open circuit voltage of 1.50 V and a peak power density of 116 mW cm−2, and excellent flexibility and cycling stability as a cathode. This bimetallic-ion-coexchange strategy of MOFs gives an effective methodology involving bimetallic-ion-coexchange strategy to design and prepare bifunctional electroctalysts in metal-air batteries but also brings an intensive insight into ORR and OER fundamentals.",Nano Energy
Hollow slightly oxidized CoP confined into flyover-type carbon skeleton with multiple channels as an effective adsorption-catalysis matrix for robost Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdOutstanding sulfur electrochemistry in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries relies heavily on the high conductivity of electrodes and the interaction of sulfur species and their reservoir matrix, which requires a reasonable design of the microstructure of each component. Herein, hollow slightly oxidized cobalt phosphides (h-O-CoP) nanoparticles are in-situ implanted into the flyover-type carbon framework composed of the N-doped C polyhedrons threaded with 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on 2D graphene sheets (h-O-CoP-NCG). During the synthesis process, a facile “go-between” strategy and post-heat treatment phosphating technique of the corresponding precursors is implemented to generate abundant electrocatalytic-adsorption sites and provide better electron/ion transportation for durable Li-S batteries. Combining the merits of h-O-CoP active sites and conductive NCG channels, the h-O-CoP-NCG enables stable and efficient sulfur electrochemistry including superior rate capability of ∼857 mAh g−1 at 4 C and robust cyclability over 500 cycles at 2 C with an average decay rate of 0.033% per cycle. Even under high sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm−2), the capacity retention remains 91.6% after 300 cycles at 0.5 C. DFT calculations confirm the metallic characteristics of O-CoP (011)-Li2S via the orbital hybridization of the Co 3d-S 2p and the strong adsorption of O-CoP (011) and Li2S6, thereby enhancing the performances of the sulfur cathode.",Electrochimica Acta
Sulfur/Nitrogen Co-Doped Mesoporous Carbon for High-Performance Lithium-Ion Battery Anodes,"© 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.Mesoporous carbon (MC) with assembly building blocks of different scales and heteroatom-doping is a promising material that can deliver enhanced electrochemical performance through suitable modifications in the surface-based properties of carbon electrodes. Particularly, S/N co-doped MC, with adjustable microstructure and controllable incorporation, has garnered significant interest. In this study, MCs with high specific surface areas are co-doped with S and N atoms by employing a facile aqueous self-assembly method that takes advantage of a hydrothermal doping strategy. The S/N co-doping content is adjusted by varying the amount of thiourea, and increased doping significantly enhances the specific capacitance. An electrode synthesized using 6% thiourea in phenol exhibits a discharge capacity of 657.0 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. When evaluated as electrodes of Li-ion batteries, the resultant material exhibits excellent rate capability and significant stability after 1000 cycles. This is attributed to the specific oxygen-containing functional groups, enhanced surface polarization owing to the heteroatoms, and enhanced oxygen and ion adsorption with S/N co-doping. Optimized S/N-MCs are promising candidates for application toward high-performance Li-ion battery anodes.",Journal of Electronic Materials
Ultra-high-rate lithium-sulfur batteries with high sulfur loading enabled by Mn2O3-carbonized bacterial cellulose composite as a cathode host,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLithium-sulfur batteries have received significant attention due to their high specific capacity and natural abundance of the sulfur cathode. However, the notorious issue of higher-order lithium-polysulfides dissolution causes inferior cycling and poor electrochemical performance. To overcome the challenge, here, biodegradable and environmentally friendly carbonized bacterial cellulose (CBC) is used as the sulfur host. Further, Mn2O3 is incorporated in bacterial cellulose using hydrothermal synthesis and investigated as a sulfur host. The composite is prepared by a facile encapsulation “melt-diffusion” strategy. The high electronic conductivity of the CBC provides an efficient pathway to carry out redox reactions, and Mn2O3 helps to restrain and convert higher-order lithium-polysulfides to lower-order lithium-polysulfides. Further, the first-principle density functional theory calculation is performed to investigate and understand the role of carbon (CBC) and Mn2O3 in the host material. The lithium-sulfur cell with Mn2O3@CBC cathode host delivers a significantly high initial reversible capacity of 1150 mAh g−1(cathode) (i.e., 1450 mAh g−1(sulfur)) at 0.1 C. It retains a reversible capacity of 254 mAh g−1(cathode) (i.e., 554 mAh g−1(sulfur)) even at the ultra-high rate of 15.0 C. Furthermore, to achieve a practical high energy density and its commercial adoption, we tested lithium-sulfur cells with high areal sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm−2. The cell shows promising electrochemical performance for long 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 70%. The cell performance is competitive and superior to the current state-of-the-art lithium-sulfur cells reported in the literature.",Electrochimica Acta

Multi-functional ZnS quantum Dots/Graphene aerogel modified separator for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been considered as a promising candidate for next-generation energy storage, yet their practical application is limited by the polysulfides (PS) shuttle effect and slow kinetics of sulfur redox reaction. Despite the progress in engineering the separator for Li-S batteries, the separator with the synergistic effect of efficient PS blockage and PS conversion catalysis has not been successfully explored. Here, a zinc sulfide quantum dots/reduced graphene aerogel (ZnS-RGA) modified separator is developed for Li-S batteries. ZnS quantum dots function as the chemically LiPS-anchoring and catalytic sites that can simultaneously accelerate the sulfur redox reaction (SRR) and suppress the shuttle effect, while the 3D porous RGA further physically blocks the migration of LiPS. As a consequence, the Li-S batteries with ZnS-RGA modified separator present a high initial discharge capacity of 1211 mAh g − 1 at 0.1 C and stable cycling performance over 500 cycles at 1 C. We believe the strategy incorporating the SRR catalysts with LiPS-immobilizing separator will be an appealing way for producing high-performance Li-S devices.",Electrochimica Acta
Effect of poly(acrylic acid) binder on the stability of sulfur-enriched crystalline Mo3S13 clusters for high capacity of Li-ion batteries,"© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Molybdenum sulfide (MoSx)-based materials have been extensively studied as a potential alternative of low-capacity graphite anode, owing to their remarkable capacity through intercalation and conversion reactions. However, these materials should be electrochemically activated at a low potential in first discharge and simultaneously degrade, owing to their inert basal plane and unstable sulfur configuration, respectively, leading to unexpectedly low performance. Hence, it is necessary to apply sulfur-enriched crystalline Mo3S13 clusters as an anode material to increase the number of active sites and energy densities. Unlike MoS2 possessing only terminal sulfur, Mo3S13 clusters have higher sulfur content with various and stable configuration in their structure, which can act as additional active sulfur sites. To realize an electrode with high energy density, we used the Mo3S13 clusters without any carbon supports as active materials. In the electrode preparation, we confirmed that employing poly(acrylic acid) and isopropyl alcohol as a binder and solvent, respectively, was appropriate for retaining the cluster crystallinity, resulting in the enhanced cycling stability. The Mo3S13 cluster-based electrode as a carbon-free electrode exhibited capacity of 1192 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and good C-rate capability. The significant capacity variation with the selective removal of sulfur configuration in Mo3S13 clusters indicates that the increased sulfur contents were provided as additional sources for (de)lithiation.",International Journal of Energy Research

However, there are still some scientific issues that seriously hinder the further development of devices, including unsustainability, high material cost, complex fabrication process, safety issues, and unsatisfactory performance. Nanocellulose has aroused tremendous attention in recent decades, because of its abundant resources, renewability, degradability, low-cost, and unique physical/chemical properties.

Nevertheless, rational and controllable design of honeycomb-like porous carbon materials with rich planar holes remains a tremendous challenge. Herein, we develop a “bottom-up” self-assembly of carbon- and nitrogen-rich conjugated polymer and subsequent potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) facilitated activation, catalysis and self-generated template assisted carbonization strategy to construct nitrogen self-doped honeycomb-like porous carbon nanoframework (NHPC) with rich planar holes. By exploiting the advantages of the integral and interconnected honeycomb-like carbon skeleton and rich planar holes (rapid ion/electron diffusion) and the efficient nitrogen doping (improved wettability), the NHPC possesses high specific capacitance of 288 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and outstanding rate performance. In addition, an aqueous symmetric supercapacitor fabricated from NHPC electrodes possesses widened potential window of 2.0 V, high energy density of 23.6 Wh kg−1 at 500 W kg−1, as well as excellent electrochemical stability (91.2 % capacitance retention after 20,000 cycles).",Batteries and Supercaps
Removing mercury from flue gas by sulfur-doped zeolite-templated carbon: Synthesize and adsorption mechanism,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Elemental mercury is harmful to humanity and the ecological environment. It is a simple and feasible method to capture elemental mercury by carbon-based adsorbents. The purpose of this work is to develop zeolite-templated carbon with and without sulfur (ZTC and S-doped ZTC) and to explore their mercury adsorption performance. ZTC and S-doped ZTC were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and their mercury adsorption performance were tested at 30 and 150 °C. Among all ZTC samples, BEA-ZTC-HS exhibited highest mercury removal efficiency (MRE) whose initial value was 99.99% (150 °C) and 97.39% (30 °C) and decreased to 96.63% and 89.15% after one hour mercury adsorption. The physical and chemical properties of the ZTC samples were characterized by various methods to explain the high MRE of BEA-ZTC-HS. The experimental results shown that BEA-ZTC-HS replicated the crystal structure of BEA zeolite faithfully and exhibited regular microporous structure and doesn't have obvious elemental sulfur whose existence could block the micropores in ZTC. This was helpful to the mass transfer of Hg0 in ZTC. Moreover, the chemical properties of BEA-ZTC-HS shown that the introduced sulfur were mainly bonded to the carbon framework of ZTC in the form of thiophene, sulfone, sulfoxide and sulfonic acid. Those sulfur-containing functional groups provided main active sites for mercury capture and exhibited higher activity at 150 °C. Finally, Density Functional Theory (DFT) was used to reveal the adsorption mechanism of ZTC and S-doped ZTC on Hg0. Due to its good properties of regeneration, higher MRE, good thermal stability and low cost, BEA-ZTC-HS has a wide prospect for industrial application in the wide temperature ranges compared to the activated carbon injection technology.",Separation and Purification Technology
Changes in structure and stability of lithium polysulfides encapsulated in carbon nanotubes: A DFT study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li[sbnd]S) batteries are emanating as the next generation alternatives for rechargeable batteries. However, the loss of capacity and self-discharge due to the dissolution of lithium polysulfides hinders their practical applications. In this study, we performed density functional theory simulations to explore the importance of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as possible anchoring channels to immobilize soluble lithium polysulfides (Li2S2n, where n = 2,3, and 4). We quantitatively investigated the interplay between confinement effects and interaction energy of Li2S2n species with CNT to address the shuttling effect. Our results demonstrate that the interaction between CNTs and lithium polysulfides is governed by electrostatic interactions. Based on the interaction energies, Charge transfer analysis, and density of states, we found that CNTs facilitate the immobilization of Li2S2n. Results obtained from this study will provide useful guidelines to improve the performance of Li[sbnd]S batteries.",Journal of Molecular Liquids
Effective removal of tetracycline from water by catalytic peroxymonosulfate oxidation over Co@MoS2: Catalytic performance and degradation mechanism,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Co-based heterogeneous catalysts exhibit relatively high performance on peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for antibiotic pollution control in water. But the aggregation and loss of active components limit their expanded application. In this study, a 3D rose-like MoS2 was designed and synthesized to anchor Co in its special lamellar structure and achieve its high dispersion. 98.9% of tetracycline (TC) was removed within 60 min with a mineralization rate of 50.5% under neutral condition. The accelerated valence cycle between Co2+ and Co3+ was the key to PMS activation and TC degradation. And the lamellar structure of MoS2 endowed the catalyst with better stability and inhibited Co leaching. The influences of common anions (Cl−, HCO3−, H2PO4−, and SO42−) and humic acid in aqueous solution on TC degradation were systematically investigated. The catalytic mechanism of PMS activation and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) over Co@MoS2 were deeply investigated. The reduced biotoxicity of the intermediates indicated the potential of Co@MoS2/PMS system for the control of environmental risks caused by TC. This work provided a new insight for the design of metal-doped heterogeneous catalyst with high stability and a new direction for the remediation of antibiotic contamination in water.",Separation and Purification Technology
Constructing the separation pathway for photo-generated carriers by diatomic sites decorated on MIL-53-NH2(Al) for enhanced photocatalytic performance,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.High yield production of phenol from hydroxylation of benzene with low energy consumption is of paramount importance, but still challenging. Herein, a new strategy, consisting of using diatomic synergistic modulation (DSM) to effectively control the separation of photo-generated carriers for an enhanced production of phenol is reported. The atomic level dispersion of Fe and Cr respectively decorated on Al based MIL-53-NH2 photocatalyst (Fe1/Cr:MIL-53-NH2) is designed, in which Cr single atoms are substituted for Al3+ while Fe single atoms are coordinated by N. Notably, the Fe1/Cr:MIL-53-NH2 significantly boosts the photo-oxidation of benzene to phenol under visible light irradiation, which is much higher than those of MIL-53-NH2, Cr:MIL-53-NH2, Fe1/MIL-53-NH2, and Fe nanoparticles/Cr:MIL-53-NH2 catalysts. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the Cr single atoms and Fe single atoms can act as electron acceptor and electron donor, respectively, during photocatalytic reaction, exhibiting a synergistic effect on the separation of the photo-generated carriers and thereby causing great enhancement on the benzene oxidation. This strategy provides new insights for rational design of advanced photocatalysts at the atomic level. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research

Atomic Fe−N Doped Multi-Cavity Hollow Carbon Nanoreactor as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium-sulfur (Li−S) batteries have been highly praised for the key rechargeable batteries due to their numerous advantages. However, the sluggish conversion and shuttling effect of polysulfides restrict their practicality. Here we rationally design the multi-cavity hollow carbon spheres doped with atomic Fe−N sites (Fe−N/MCHCS) as physically/chemically double-confined catalytic nanoreactors for the efficient sulfur host materials. The Fe−N/MCHCS with hierarchical porous structure and high pore volume ensures the high loading mass, and the multi-cavity structures significantly buffer the volume expansion of sulfur and enhance the electronic contact. Meanwhile, atomic Fe offers chemical binding site and efficiently catalyzes the conversion of polysulfides during cycling, thus immobilizing and alleviating the shutting effect of polysulfides. Consequently, the Fe−N/MCHCS nanoreactor based Li−S batteries deliver a long cycling life of 1135 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 C and high-rate capability of 1055 mAh g−1 at 8 C. Even under practical conditions with a high sulfur mass loading of 5.0 mg cm−2, a steady areal capacity of 4.85 mAh cm−2 is attained. This strategy combing multi-cavity hollow carbon with single atom catalysis opens a reliable route to design highly stable and high-performance Li−S batteries.",Batteries and Supercaps

However, the vast majority of these host materials are not yet used for the construction of high-energy-density batteries, due to the lack of effective ways to fabricate high-performance cathodes under high-sulfur-loading conditions. Here we present a convenient and universal strategy toward traditional slurry-coating procedure for fabricating high-sulfur-loading cathodes. Through rational designing conductive additives and polymer binders, their derived water-based conductive inks are developed to improve the mechanical and conductive properties of the slurry-coating cathodes and to reduce the polysulfide shuttling of the slurry-coating cathodes with high sulfur content (64–72 wt%) and high sulfur loading (>5 mg cm−2). This strategy not only enables the Super-P/S cathodes to deliver the enhanced structure parameters and electrochemical performance for constructing a 2.5 Ah pouch cell with a specific energy of 323 Wh kg−1, but also is suitable for diverse lab-developed sulfur hosts, thus opening a promising avenue for high-energy-density Li-S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Atomically-dispersed Mn-(N-C2)2(O-C2)2 sites on carbon for efficient oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Owing to their ultimate mass-catalytic activity, simple active site configuration and readily tunable electronic structures, transition-metal single atoms (SAs) on carbon support have emerged as a new category of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we exemplify the use of atomically dispersed Mn with N, O heteroatoms-coordinated Mn sites to enhance alkaline ORR performance. A combined sol-gel/carbonization approach is developed to controllably anchor Mn-SAs onto graphitic carbon nanosheets via a hybridized N, O coordination configuration of Mn-(N-C2)2(O-C2)2 (denoted as Mn-SA@CNSs). The obtained Mn-SA@CNSs exhibits superior alkaline ORR electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.88 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH. The rechargeable Zn–air battery assembled using Mn-SA@CNSs air cathode can readily attain a high power density of 177 mW cm−2 with a narrow voltage gap of 0.76 V at 5 mA cm−2. Density functional theory calculations unveil that altering the coordination environment of Mn-SAs from N-coordinated Mn-(N-C2)4 to N-/O-coordinated Mn-(N-C2)2(O-C2)2 alters the d-band electronic structures and regulates the binding strength of ORR intermediates on Mn-SA sites to dramatically reduce the energy barrier and enhance ORR activity. The exemplified hybridization coordination approach in this work would be applicable to alter the electronic structures of other transition-metal SAs for ORR and other reactions.",Energy Storage Materials

Organic Macromolecule regulated the structure of vanadium oxide with high capacity and stability for aqueous Zinc-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The aqueous zinc-ion rechargeable batteries (AZIBs) have become a promising alternative for large-scale energy storage applications and triggered a great deal of scientific research due to low cost, high security, and eco-efficiency. Here, we report the successful synthesis of phytic acid coated/inserted V2O5 nano-composites (PHVO) by one-step hydrothermal method. On one hand, the surface of V2O5 nanosheets is uniformly coated by phytic acid to form an ultrathin layer, serving as a stabilizer to greatly enhance the structural stability by restraining the exfoliation of active materials during the cycling process. On the other hand, the phytic acid plays as the intercalary spacer to expand the V2O5 interlayer distance to 13.5 Å, which is beneficial to the diffusion kinetics of Zn2+ by offering expedited channels. With the abovementioned advantages, the overall electrochemical performance of PHVO has been significantly improved. It showed an excellent specific capacity of 406 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and the capacity retention rate was 97.3% after 6000 cycles at 5 A g−1. This work paves the way to the design and fabrication of stable cathodes for AZIBs with excellent electrochemical performance.",Applied Surface Science
An ion sieving conjugated microporous thermoset ultrathin membrane for high-performance Li-S battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is an attractive candidate for next-generation energy storage devices due to its high theoretical energy density, but its practical applications are hindered by polysulfides shuttling and lithium dendrite growth. In this study, a solution-processable conjugated microporous thermoset (CMT) was used as an ultrathin ion sieving layer on a commercial PP separator. The CMT layer is as thin as ∼200 nm and possesses continuous sub-nanochannels. Molecular dynamic simulations show that the nanoporous polymeric network allows Li-ion passage while blocking polysulfides shuttling between the electrodes based on size-exclusive effects. In addition, the CMT layer acts as a buffer zone for the uniform distribution of Li ions on the surface of the Li anode to suppress the growth of lithium dendrites. As a result, Li-S battery employing the CMT-modified polypropylene separator achieves a high initial capacity of 849.6 mAh g−1 with an ultralow attenuation rate of 0.037% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C, as well as a capacity of 619.0 mAh g−1 at an ultrahigh current density of 10 C. Remarkably, it exhibits a capacity of 727.8 mAh g−1 with ∼ 77% capacity retention over 500 cycles lifespan at a high current density of 5C, showing great potential for practical high-performance Li-S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Sorption studies of dimethyl sulfoxide and tetrahydrofuran on gamma arsenene nanotubes – A first-principles study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The innovation of arsenene opens the door for many fascinating applications. In the present work, gamma arsenene nanotubes (γ-AsNT) are designed and structural stability is ensured. Besides, γ-AsNT exhibits an energy band gap of 0.346 eV. We deployed γ-AsNT as detecting and removing material for dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) in the water. The adsorption energy studies reveal the chemisorption of DMSO and THF on γ-AsNT. The changes in the projected density of states (PDOS) and band structure are observed owing to the adsorption of DMSO and THF on γ-AsNT. The electron density difference variations due to DMSO and THF adsorption are also explored. The findings open the gate for new sensing and removal mediums towards DMSO and THF molecules in the aqueous environment.",Applied Surface Science

In this report, sustainable pollen derived three-dimensional porous carbon/graphene composites with Zn and N doping are developed as non-precious catalyst toward oxygen reduction reaction. The prepared Zn and N doped porous carbon/graphene composites show a hierarchical porous structure, large specific area, and high N contents. As catalyst toward oxygen reduction reaction, the prepared sample with an optimized graphene content exhibits a half-wave potential ~ 0.90 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode), and a limited current density of 5.5 mA cm−2 in alkaline electrolytes. Meanwhile, it manifests remarkable electrochemical stability and superior tolerance to methanol poisoning. It is found that Zn, N doping and introduction of graphene are key factors for the improved oxygen electrocatalytic capability because active sites and conductivity are strengthened. Moreover, the prepared sample also shows a good oxygen reduction activity in acid electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that Zn–N4 is the major and the most active site.

Superior polysulfide adsorption ability by using Ti3C2 nanosheets as effective reservoirs for high electrochemical performance,"© 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).BACKGROUND: A large amount of research has improved electrochemical performance by strengthening the chemical affinity by using polar materials in lithium–sulfur batteries. However, only some of this research has focused on the relationship between structure and polysulfide adsorption ability. RESULTS: In this work, a Ti3C2 nanosheet structure has been applied as sulfur host matrix to improve electrochemical performance. Due to the nanosheet structure, the polysulfide was able to diffuse between the Ti3C2 layers, therefore improving the catalytic effect of the polysulfide. Moreover, the space between the Ti3C2 layers can store the soluble polysulfide as an effective reservoir. As a result, the traditional shuttle effect of the polysulfide could be efficiently inhibited. CONCLUSION: Therefore, the as-prepared Ti3C2/S composites exhibited high specific capacity, high rate performance, and stable cycle performance. All these superior electrochemical performances are attributed to the presence of the Ti3C2 nanosheet. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).",Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology
Efficient purification of tetracycline wastewater by activated persulfate with heterogeneous Co-V bimetallic oxides,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The persistence and wide dispersion of antibiotics have a severe impact on the ecological environment. Developing an effective method with universal applicability to remove pollutants is pretty necessary. Herein, a bimetallic oxides (Co3V2O8) heterogeneous material was successfully prepared and used to activate the persulfate (PS) for purification of tetracycline (TC) wastewater. By exploring the reaction conditions and influencing factors, the removal rate of 50 mg⋅L-1 TC reached 87.1% by Co3V2O8/PS system, and the reaction rate constant was up to 0.0271 min−1. As a highly efficient catalyst for the activation of PS, Co3V2O8/PS system produces radicals of SO4•−, •OH, •O2– and 1O2 in the reaction process due to the Co(II) and V(IV) exchange electrons with S2O82- and O2. Simultaneously, the internal electron exchange occurs between Co(II)/Co(III) and V(IV)/V(V), which stabilizes the content of Co(II) and V(IV). This work provides a novel activator for PS activation to degrade contaminants and contributes to a better understanding of the PS activation mechanism by transition compound.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Molten salts approach of metal-organic framework-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon as sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Author(s)Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted significant attention as next-generation energy storage systems owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g−1) and energy density (2567 Wh kg−1). However, the low electrical conductivity of S and the dissolution of polysulfides in organic electrolytes pose significant challenges for their industrial applications. Herein, we report a facile, scalable, and solvent-free synthetic method based on metal–organic-framework (MOF) for synthesizing N-doped carbon-based materials with hierarchical porous structures and large specific surface areas (2297 m2 g−1) as efficient cathode hosts for Li-S batteries. The cathode materials were synthesized via solvent-free mixing, followed by the direct carbonization of adenine and tetracarboxylic acid with zinc acetate using the molten salt method. Zinc salt was employed as a template for mesopores as well as binding sites for other organic materials. The irregular surface morphology and N-doping of the resulting porous carbons act as physical barriers to confine polysulfides within the carbon matrix. The S-loaded cathode was stable and exhibited a discharge capacity of 555 mAh g−1 over 290 cycles at a current density of 0.5C, corresponding to the capacity retention of 63%. The facile modified MOF synthetic strategy, assisted by molten salt processing, holds promise for the synthesis of noble cathode materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Bandgap engineering of strained S-terminated MXene and its promising application as NOx gas sensor,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Very recently, Kamysbayev et al.’s study (Science, 2020, 369, 979) reported the successful synthesis of S-terminated MXenes, while the metallic properties of these materials suppress their further applications. In the present study, by taking M2CS2 (M = Ti, Hf or Zr) as the examples, our theoretical results revealed that the M2CS2 exhibits the high selectivity and poor sensitivity towards NOx gases. To solve this issue, the electronic property of M2CS2 was considered to modulate by applying strains. It is found that the band gap of Hf2CS2 is opened at 5% biaxial strain under the GGA-PBE functional, while the structures of Ti2CS2 and Zr2CS2 become disordered during the modulation processes. Interestingly, the Hf2CS2 at 5% biaxial strain changes from semiconductor into conductor after the adsorption of NOx, and the sensitivity of Hf2CS2 towards NO and NO2 increases from 15% and 21% (without strain) to 106% and 329% (at 5% strain), respectively. Together with the moderate adsorption energies (−0.33 to −0.17 eV), we proposed that the Hf2CS2 is a promising reusable NOx gas sensor with both high selectivity and sensitivity. More importantly, our results provided an effective strategy to modulate the electronic properties of S-terminated MXenes, which will further extend their applications.",Applied Surface Science

Hollow metal-organic framework promotes stable and fast lithium sulfur batteries 中空金属-有机框架促进稳定和快速的锂硫电池,"© 2022 Journal of Functional Materials. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur battery is one of the most promising energy storage systems because of its high energy density and low cost.However, the commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries is still hampered by several technical problems, namely severe polysulfide shuttle and slow sulfur conversion kinetics.In this paper, we report a unique hollow MOFs to capture and catalyze polysulfide to achieve high efficiency lithium-sulfur batteries.The porous hollow structures can not only tolerate the volume change during the charging-discharging process, but also expose a large number of active sites within MOFs and promote the sulfur conversion redox.Due to these structural advantages, the prepared sulfur electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance.At 3 C, the average capacity decay of each cycle after 800 cycles is 0.06%.Under a higher 4 C charge/discharge current, it still has an initial capacity of 598 mAh/g, the average capacity decay per cycle is only 0.07% after 1 000 cycles.",Gongneng Cailiao/Journal of Functional Materials
Modification of surface electronic structure via Ru-doping: Porous Ru–CoFeP nanocubes to boost the oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with excellent activity and favorable stability are received much attention, due to the urgent requirement for green energy. Herein, we report a low-cost, highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst, Ru–CoFeP (Ru doped CoFeP nanocubes). The superior OER performance of Ru–CoFeP is ascribed to the synergistic effects of the Ru doping, porous structure and exposed active sites. Ru–CoFeP catalyst owns a small overpotential of 185 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a Tafel slope of 67.6 mV dec−1 and a Cdl value of 9.1 mF cm−2, which is much better than those of undoped CoFeP catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the electrons would move toward to Ru after the Ru doping on the active CoFeP (111) surface and the adsorption capacity to H2O molecules is also strengthened to elongate and break O–H bond. The Ru–CoFeP + Pt/C based rechargeable Zn-air battery exhibits excellent stability with slightly increased/decreased potential after 450 cycles at the current density of 5 mA cm−2, which shows a much better performance than that of RuO2+Pt/C battery. This work not only provides an efficient low-cost OER catalyst, but also demonstrates that Ru-doping would be a feasible strategy to enhance OER performance.",Journal of Power Sources
Gas sensing and capturing based on the C7N6 monolayer with and without metal decoration: A first-principles investigation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.We have investigated the geometrics, energetics, charge transfer, electron localization function (ELF), electron difference density (EDD), work function, electronic and gas sensing and capturing properties of the pure and metal-decorated C7N6 monolayers toward gases like NO2, SO2, NO, NH3, H2O, H2S, CO, CH4, CO2 and N2 by means of first-principles calculations. It is discovered the pristine C7N6 monolayer is not suitable for gas sensing and capturing materials. The Li decoration on the C7N6 monolayer is energetically and kinetically favorable, and remarkably enhances the adsorption strength of toxic gases (NO2, SO2, NO, and NH3), which in turn significantly influences the electronic properties (particularly conductivity) of the Li-decorated monolayer with apparent charge transfer and changes in work functions. Based on the analysis of recovery time, adsorption strength, changes in electronic properties and work function, the capture capacities and the influence of humidity on the sensing and capturing properties of NO2, SO2, NO, and NH3 on the monolayer, the Li-decorated C7N6 monolayer would be a promising potential of highly sensitive gas sensing and capturing materials for NO and NH3 gases, and an effective scavenger of NO2 and SO2 in specific scenarios in dry environment that call for experimental evaluation.",Applied Surface Science
Enhancing catalytic properties of noble metal@MoS2/WS2 heterojunction for the hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transition metal disulfides (MoS2 and WS2) are regarded as the potential candidates for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction. However, their practical application is hindered due to the inert basic plane, the few active sites and the low electrical conductivity. The specially coupled interface with strong electronic interaction and low interface impedance in heterostructure helps to improve the catalytic hydrogen evolution performance of the catalyst. Therefore, we construct MoS2/WS2 heterojunction to investigate it's catalytic hydrogen evolution behavior. The transition metal elements (Pt and Pd) are doped for further enhancing the catalytic hydrogen evolution performance of the heterojunction. Our results show that the Pt-doped heterojunction (Pt@MoS2/Pt@WS2) has a ΔGH of 0.008 eV as well as Volmer/Heyrovsky reaction energy barrier of 0.293 eV/0.702 eV, which can be used as a high-efficiency hydrogen evolution catalyst.Naturally, the high catalytic activity of Pt@MoS2/Pt@WS2 is attributed to four important factors. Firstly, the unique heterostructure improves the inherent electrical conductivity and catalytic activity. Secondly, the doped elements narrow the band gap, which further promotes the electron transport of the catalyst. Thirdly, the new impurity levels produced by doping make the catalysts easy to bond hydrogen protons. Fourthly, the unique charge distribution of electron depletion-accumulation-depletion regions on the basic plane invites the competitive effect between adsorption enhancement and adsorption weakening, thereby inducing the best Gibbs free energy change of adsorbed hydrogen and the low hydrogen evolution reaction energy barrier.",Applied Surface Science
Exploring the anchoring effect of surface functionalized 2D electrides Ca2N and Y2C in lithium sulfur battery: First principle study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Although lithium sulfur batteries (LiSBs) have high theoretical capacity and energy density, the shuttle effect seriously hinders its development. In this work, the anchoring properties of single-sided modified Ca2NX and Y2CX and double-sided modified Ca2NX2 and Y2CX2 (X = H, O, F, Cl and S) in LiSBs were systematically studied by first principle calculation. The unmodified sides of Ca2NF, Y2CH, Y2CCl and Y2CS have a strong interaction with S8, but it will promote the decomposition of S8 and cause unnecessary loss of active materials. On the contrary, double-sided modified Ca2NCl2, Y2CF2 and Y2CCl2 have moderate adsorption energies for lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn) and S8. The decomposition barriers of Li2S on the surfaces of Ca2NCl2 and Y2CCl2 are significantly lower than that of natural Li2S, and Li+ has a rapid diffusivity on their surfaces. Therefore, Ca2NCl2 and Y2CCl2 can suppress the shuttle effect and improve the battery performance, which indicates they are ideal anchoring materials for LiSBs.",Applied Surface Science
"N,S-Doped hollow carbon nanosheet-encapsulated Co9S8 nanoparticles as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries","© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The development of bifunctional electrocatalysts based on non-noble metals for the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) that have rationally designed structures and inexpensive components is of practical significance for the commercialization of rechargeable zinc-air batteries. Here, we report the rational synthesis of Co9S8 nanoparticles embedded in N,S co-doped hollow carbon nanosheets (Co9S8/NSC) as highly efficient oxygen electrocatalysts. The catalyst is formed when a Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67), grown on a Zn-based ZIF (ZIF-8) template, is partially vulcanized following thioacetamide (TAA) and thermal treatment. The resulting catalyst, Co9S8/NSC-3, shows satisfactory bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in 0.1 M KOH, in which the half-wave potential (E1/2) for the ORR is 0.82 V and the overpotential for the OER at 10 mA cm−2 is just 350 mV. Furthermore, as the air electrode material in a practical demonstration of a rechargeable liquid zinc-air battery, Co9S8/NSC-3 exhibits promising battery performance with a high specific capacity of 804 mA h g−1 and a pleasing charge/discharge cyclability of over 140 h at 10 mA cm−2. The satisfactory activity of Co9S8/NSC-3 can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the Co9S8 nanoparticles with the N,S-doped hollow carbon nanosheet structure, resulting in an effective electrochemically active surface with fully exposed active sites that give fast catalytic kinetics.",Dalton Transactions
Two-dimensionalcovalent triazine frameworks as superior nanocarriers for the delivery of thioguanine anti-cancer drugs: a periodic DFT study,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.This work aims to introduce a superior nanocarrier for thioguanine (TG) anti-cancer drug delivery, drug release, and cancer therapy through computational chemistry. First, the properties of TG drug adsorption on covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs) were examined by periodic density-functional theory. A range of −0.169 to −0.921 eV was obtained for the adsorption energy of the TG/CTF complexes, and the CTF sheet is predicted as a suitable adsorbent in a gaseous/aqueous environment. The analysis of electronic properties due to drug adsorption on nanosheets was performed to determine the CTF electronic response to the TG drug, which was impressive with %ΔEg of drug/CTF complexes in the range of 50-85%. The recovery time (τ) of the TG drug release from the CTF sheet in the vicinity of cancer tissues was obtained as 1000 seconds for the most stable drug/CTF complex. The process of drug release from the carrier in cancerous tissues in an acidic environment was also analyzed, and is reported in detail. The results indicate that the delivery and release of the TG anti-cancer drug in the vicinity of cancer cells using a synthesized pristine CTF nanocarrier will show excellent therapeutic efficiency.",New Journal of Chemistry
Spin-state regulating of cobalt assisted by iron doping and coordination for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCCustomizing catalysts from the electronic structure, such as spin state, is an effective but challenging strategy for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, an ultrafine Co–Fe material highly dispersed on nitrogen carbide matrix is fabricated by coordination polymer and self-templating method to scrutinize the impact of spin state of Co on OER through Fe doping. The optimized catalyst shows boosted OER performance, which only requires overpotential of 333 mV at 10 mA cm−2, outperforming other control samples and commercial RuO2. The elevated local spin states of Co by Fe doping lead to charge transfer acceleration and fast generation of oxygenated intermediates, which is proved to account for the OER elevation. In addition, the long-term stability of Co–Fe material is guaranteed by the strong coordination of Co/Fe to the melamine-formaldehyde resin, which is used to adsorb metal ions, contributing to the high dispersion of active sites during the OER process.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
"Theoretical prediction of structure, electronic and optical properties of VH2 hydrogen storage material","© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCThe vanadium hydrides have better hydrogen storage capacity in comparison to the other metal hydrides. Although the structure of VH2 hydride has been reported, the structural stability, electronic and optical properties of VH2 hydride are unclear. To solve these problems, we apply the first-principles method to study the structural stability, electronic and optical properties of VH2 hydrides. Similar to the metal dihydrides, four possible VH2 hydrides such as the cubic (Fm-3m), tetragonal (I4/mmm), tetragonal (P42/mnm) and orthorhombic (Pnma) are designed. The result shows that the cubic VH2 hydride is a thermodynamic and dynamical stability. In particular, the tetragonal (I4/mmm) and the orthorhombic (Pnma) VH2 hydrides are firstly predicted. It is found that these VH2 hydrides show metallic behavior. The electronic interaction of V (d-state)-H (s-state) is beneficial to improve the hydrogen storage in VH2 hydride. In addition, the formation of V–H bond can improve the structural stability of VH2 hydride. Based on the analysis of optical properties, it is found that all VH2 hydrides show the ultraviolet response. Compared to the tetragonal and orthorhombic VH2 hydrides, the cubic VH2 hydride has better storage optical properties. Therefore, we believe that the VH2 hydride is a promising hydrogen storage material.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy

Toward Bottom-Up Understanding of Transport in Concentrated Battery Electrolytes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Bottom-up understanding of transport describes how molecular changes alter species concentrations and electrolyte voltage drops in operating batteries. Such an understanding is essential to predictively design electrolytes for desired transport behavior. We herein advocate building a structure-property-performance relationship as a systematic approach to accurate bottom-up understanding. To ensure generalization across salt concentrations as well as different electrolyte types and cell configurations, the property-performance relation must be described using Newman's concentrated solution theory. It uses Stefan-Maxwell diffusivity, ij, to describe the role of molecular motions at the continuum scale. The key challenge is to connect ij to the structure. We discuss existing methods for making such a connection, their peculiarities, and future directions to advance our understanding of electrolyte transport.",ACS Central Science
Enhanced Cyclability of Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Anti-aggregation of Lithiophilic Seeds,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Constructing 3D skeletons modified with lithiophilic seeds has proven effective in achieving dendrite-free lithium metal anodes. However, these lithiophilic seeds are mostly alloy- or conversion-type materials, and they tend to aggregate and redistribute during cycling, resulting in the failure of regulating Li deposition. Herein, we address this crucial but long-neglected issue by using intercalation-type lithiophilic seeds, which enable antiaggregation owing to their negligible volume expansion and high electrochemical stability against Li. To exemplify this, a 3D carbon-based host is built, in which ultrafine TiO2seeds are uniformly embedded in nitrogen-doped hollow porous carbon spheres (N-HPCSs). The TiO2@N-HPCSs electrode exhibits superior Coulombic efficiency, high-rate capability, and long-term stability when evaluated as compertitive anodes for Li metal batteries. Furthermore, the superiority of intercalation-type seeds is comprehensively revealed through controlled experiments by various in situ/ex situ electron and optical microscopies, which highlights the excellent structural stability and lithiophilicity of TiO2nanoseeds upon repeated cycling.",Nano Letters
Realizing High Utilization of High-Mass-Loading Sulfur Cathode via Electrode Nanopore Regulation,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.One main challenge of realizing high-energy-density lithium-sulfur batteries is low active materials utilization, excessive use of inert components, high electrolyte intake, and mechanical instability of high-mass-loading sulfur cathodes. Herein, chunky sulfur/graphene particle electrodes were designed, where active sulfur was confined in vertically aligned nanochannels (width ∼12 nm) of chunky graphene-based particles (∼70 μm) with N, O-containing groups. The short charge transport distance and low tortuosity enabled high utilization of active materials for high-mass-loading chunky sulfur/graphene particle electrodes. The intermediate polysulfide trapping effect by capillary effect and heteroatoms-containing groups, and a mechanically robust graphene framework, helped to realize stable electrode cycling. The as-designed electrode showed high areal capacity (10.9 mAh cm-2) and high sulfur utilization (72.4%) under the rigorous conditions of low electrolyte/active material ratio (∼2.5 μL mg-1) and high sulfur loading (9.0 mg cm-2), realizing high energy densities (520 Wh kg-1, 1635 Wh L-1).",Nano Letters

The as-designed G-mSnO2/SnSe2 hybrid possesses high conductivity, strong chemical affinity (SnO2), and a dynamic intercalation-conversion site (LixSnSe2), inhibits shuttle behavior, provides rapid Li-intercalative transport kinetics, accelerates LiPS conversion, and decreases the decomposition energy barrier for Li2S, which is evidenced by the ex situ XAS spectra, in situ Raman, in situ XRD, and DFT calculations. Moreover, the mesoporous G-mSnO2/SnSe2 with lithiophilic characteristics enables homogeneous Li-ion deposition and inhibits Li dendrite growth. Therefore, Li-S batteries with a G-mSnO2/SnSe2 separator achieve a favorable electrochemical performance, including high sulfur utilization (1544 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C), high-rate capability (794 mAh g-1 at 8 C), and long cycle life (extremely low attenuation rate of 0.0144% each cycle at 5 C over 2000 cycles). Encouragingly, a 1.6 g S/Ah-level pouch cell realizes a high energy density of up to 359 Wh kg-1 under a lean E/S usage of 3.0 μL mg-1.

Phase Engineering of Defective Copper Selenide toward Robust Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and the sluggish Li-S conversion kinetics are two main barriers toward the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, we propose the addition of copper selenide nanoparticles at the cathode to trap LiPS and accelerate the Li-S reaction kinetics. Using both computational and experimental results, we demonstrate the crystal phase and concentration of copper vacancies to control the electronic structure of the copper selenide, its affinity toward LiPS chemisorption, and its electrical conductivity. The adjustment of the defect density also allows for tuning the electrochemically active sites for the catalytic conversion of polysulfide. The optimized S/Cu1.8Se cathode efficiently promotes and stabilizes the sulfur electrochemistry, thus improving significantly the LSB performance, including an outstanding cyclability over 1000 cycles at 3 C with a capacity fading rate of just 0.029% per cycle, a superb rate capability up to 5 C, and a high areal capacity of 6.07 mAh cm-2 under high sulfur loading. Overall, the present work proposes a crystal phase and defect engineering strategy toward fast and durable sulfur electrochemistry, demonstrating great potential in developing practical LSBs.",ACS Nano
Accelerating the reaction kinetics of lithium-oxygen chemistry by modulating electron acceptance-donation interaction in electrocatalysts,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs) have presented great promise in next-generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density. However, the sluggish deposition and decomposition kinetics of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) on the oxygen electrode inhibits the practical application of this type of novel power source. Herein, Co-doped Zn based zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF) nanosheets are elaborately designed and used as oxygen electrode catalysts to boost the performance of LOBs. The incorporation of Co rationally regulates the 3d-orbital electron occupation of Zn sites, which results in an appropriate electron acceptance-donation interaction between Zn sites and reactants, thus achieving the efficient activation of reactants. The optimized electronic structure of Zn sites is also capable of modulating the product morphology, resulting in the formation of unique rose-like Li2O2, which guarantees efficient mass and charge transfer and establishes a superior reaction interface between discharge products and electrodes. By virtue of these merits, the LOBs with the Zn0.8Co0.2 ZIF electrode deliver a high discharge/charge capacity (12 950.7/12 916.8 mA h g−1), low overpotential (0.92 V) and outstanding cycling stability (over 500 cycles). This work provides unique insights into the design of advanced catalysts to accelerate oxygen electrode reactions at the orbital level.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
2D Single-Atom Fe-N-C Catalyst Derived from a Layered Complex as an Oxygen Reduction Catalyst for PEMFCs,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Fe single-atom catalysts of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are restricted by the agglomeration during the synthesis process and inferior stability, especially in acidic conditions. An efficient synthesis strategy is urgently needed to alleviate these disadvantages. In this work, a two-dimensional (2D) single-atom Fe-N-C catalyst derived from a layered complex was designed and synthesized for the ORR. Fe single atoms dispersed on 2D hierarchical porous N-doped carbon nanosheets (Fe-N-C) were derived from a layered complex through the coordination of Fe3+and benzidine hydrochloride. The unique 2D hierarchical porous nanosheets with a special edge effect can not only provide a large specific surface area and promote the mass transfer of ORR but also facilitate the affinity of Fe single atoms. Furthermore, the well-distributed Fe single atoms and Fe-Nx-C structure can increase the utilization rate of metal atoms and enhance the catalytic activity of materials.

All rights reserved.The preparation of separators using heat-resistant polymers is an effective approach to improve the safety of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, separators using a single heat-resistant polymer compared with the composite modified polymer have low conductivities, which leads to low battery performances. In this study, for the first time, a heat-resistant separator was successfully prepared using an ion-modified metal-organic framework (MOF) and poly(aryl ether benzimidazole)(OPBI). Diversified ion channels were constructed by ion modification combined with phase inversion and physical mixing. The lithium-ion transmission efficiency and safety of the LIBs were effectively improved. The hybrid separator exhibited a satisfactory thermal stability (absence of shrinkage at 200 °C for 1 h), higher ionic conductivity (1.46 mS cm-1), and better electrolyte uptake rate. Moreover, the hybrid separator is conducive to inhibiting the growth of Li dendrites. A cell assembled with the hybrid separator delivered a reversible capacity of 157 mA h g-1at 0.5 C. The capacity retention of the cell was up to 94% after 200 cycles. Thus, the hybrid membrane is a valuable candidate to enhance the safety and electrochemical properties of LIBs.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Constructing a Yolk-Shell Structure SiOx/C@C Composite for Long-Life Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Silicon oxide is one of the most representative anode materials for lithium-ion storage. However, the poor conductivity of silicon oxide and the large volume expansion during the repeated lithium alloying/dealloying reaction have a huge impact on the cycle stability of the electrode. Here, we propose a design strategy for constructing a yolk-shell structure to enhance the electrochemical performance of the silicon oxide-based anode. Using a silane coupling agent as the raw material, organosilicon nanoparticles are prepared by hydrolysis and a self-condensation reaction. Combining with polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride modification and polymethyl methacrylate coating, the SiOx/C@C composite with a yolk-shell structure (YS-SiOx/C@C) was obtained by one-step carbonization. The modification of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride ensures the formation of a stable cavity during the pyrolysis process, which can effectively relieve the volume variation of the silicon oxide electrode, and the carbon shell can enhance the overall conductivity. As the anode of lithium-ion batteries, the YS-SiOx/C@C electrode showed outstanding electrochemical stability with a high specific capacity of 770 mAh g-1and a Coulombic efficiency of 99% after 500 cycles (0.5 A g-1). This research provides a direction for the preparation of yolk-shell electrode materials and promotes further development of high-performance silicon oxide-based anodes.",ACS Applied Energy Materials

All rights reserved.As an ideal anode material of lithium metal for high-energy-density batteries, the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) has been limited by the Li dendrite's growth and accumulation of dead Li. To solve this problem, a highly elastic artificial polymer layer coated on the surface Li anode by rapid ultraviolet radical polymerization is developed. The clad poly(methyl methacrylate-acrylic acid-sulfobetaine methacrylate) (P(MMA-AA-SBMA)) terpolymer not only shows good interfacial compatibility with Li metal due to the surface formation process by in situ light solidification but also contains functional anion groups of -COO-and -SO3-, contributing the convenient channels to regulate the transport of Li ions. Ascribed from the stable interface of clad Li and the suppressed decomposition reaction of the liquid electrolyte in the later cycle stage, the Li||LiCoO2full cell exhibits good cycle stability, maintaining 96% of initial capacity after 100 cycles in 1C rate between 3 and 4.35 V, compared with that of 67% for bare Li. Thus, the artificial polymer cladding promotes the electrochemical stability of Li metal, providing a facile way for application in high-energy-density LMBs.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Organocatalysis-Inspired Palladium Molecule as a Robust Polysulfide-Confinement-Scissors Catalyst for Advanced Lithium-Sulfur Battery,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The rational design of effective polysulfide catalysts to alleviate shuttle effects and improve sulfur conversion kinetics is still a significant challenge for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. The organometallic palladium molecule comes to mind because of its ultrahigh catalytic activity in many industrial syntheses. Herein, a tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (TPP) catalyst decorated graphene (Gh) interlayer sandwiched between the sulfur infiltrated carbon nanotubes' (CNTs-S) cathode and the separator is developed. A combination of in situ spectroscopy, electrochemical characterization, and theoretical calculations unveils that in the battery system, the dissociation of a triphenylphosphine (PPh3) opens the lid of TPP and thus provides enough space for absorbing/catalyzing both long-chain and short-chain lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) via Pd-S bonds, while a great number of P atoms in TPP with good Li+affinity can homogenize the Li+flux and facilitate Li+transport in the battery through P-Li bonds. Because of the synergistic effect, lithium-sulfur batteries using a CNTs-S/Gh/TPP cathode manifest an excellent cycle stability with a high capacity retention of 83.7% and an areal capacity of 2.44 mAh cm-2during 180 cycles at 0.1 C under a high sulfur loading of 4.43 mg cm-2.

Quantitatively Tunable Anionic Vacancies of Iron Disulfide Nanorods with Superior Cyclability and Rate Capability for Li-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Introducing the defects into transition metal sulfides is a common strategy to improve efficiency of electrochemical reaction. The effect of vacancy concentration on the performance is also vital, but it is rarely paid attention. Herein, sulfur vacancies with quantitative concentration were introduced into porous FeS2nanorods as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). After optimizing the sulfur vacancy concentration, the VS-FeS1.71/C nanorod electrode delivered good rate performance (763.1 mA h g-1at 5.0 A g-1) and long cyclic performance (517.8 mA h g-1after 1200 cycles at 5.0 A g-1). This superior lithium storage performance was ascribed to moderate sulfur vacancies into the FeS2crystal lattice, which rearranged local atoms, regulated the electronic structure, promoted electronic conductivity, and afforded increasing active adsorption sites for Li+. However, excessive sulfur vacancies resulted in deformation of crystal planes and structural damage, which astricted the diffusion rate of Li+. The experimental results indicate that the strategy of optimizing defect concentration is beneficial to promote the electrochemical reaction, providing a feasible way to improve the performance of LIBs.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Disulfide Dichloride: A High Efficiency Vulcanizing Agent for Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathodes have shown great prospects in commercial applications due to the high discharge capacity, good cycle stability, and low self-discharge rate. However, high sulfurization temperature results in loss of nitrogen atoms, which leads to imperfect SPAN structure and is not conducive to fast electron transfer. A high efficiency vulcanizing agent of S2Cl2was used to reduce the reaction temperature in this work. We found that S2Cl2promotes PAN cyclization, reduces the cyclization reaction temperature, and avoids the loss of nitrogen atoms and the agglomeration of SPAN primary particles in high-temperature reactions. The SPAN cathode material prepared using S2Cl2has a more regular structure six-membered ring main chain structure and a smaller primary particle size, which is beneficial to the rapid conduction of electrons and lithium ions in the electrode material. The electrochemical test results confirmed that the SPAN cathode material prepared by S2Cl2has higher active material utilization, better cycle stability, and better rate performance.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Intersperse copper nanoparticles into 3D fibrous silica-supported carbon spheres for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction,"© 2022 The AuthorsThe electrocatalysts are critical to the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (e-NRR) technique and its development.

When used as electrocatalysts to e-NRR, KNC exhibits good electrochemical activity, selectivity, and good stability, and can obtain an ammonia yield of approximately 6.67 µg h−1 mgcat−1 and an excellent Faraday efficiency (FE) of 8.1% in 0.1 M sodium sulfate solution at − 0.4 V (vs. RHE).",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
"Atomically dispersed Co anchored on N,S-riched carbon as efficient electrocatalysts for advanced Li-S batteries","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery possess the advantage of high specific energy but suffer from unstable cyclic performance due to the sluggish liquid-solid conversion kinetics causing severe lithium polysulfides (LiPS) shuttling. Designing multifunctional electrocatalysts with improved activity and abundant active sites to regulate the dynamics for sulfur electrochemistry is still a significant challenge. Herein, we proposed a thiourea assisted pyrolysis combined with hard template method to synthesize cobalt single atoms co-coordinated by N and S atoms embedded hollow carbon spheres (Co-NS-HCS) as a novel sulfur host. The Co-NS-HCS mainly consists of well-dispersed Co-N3S-C center sites where Co is co-bonded by N and S atoms. Systematical characterizations revealed that the Co-NS-HCS exhibit improved SRR electrocatalytic properties with higher exchange current density and larger electron transfer number than that of Co-N-HCS. When equipped in sulfur cathodes, the S@Co-NS-HCS exhibits superior rate performance (925 mAh g−1 at 2 C), long cycle stability (69.1% of capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C). Moreover, the assembled Li-S pouch type cell also exhibits competitive cyclic performance that work stably for 100 cycles at 0.1 C with a high capacity retention of 84.7%.

Herein, we report a rational design of photochemical deposition of Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on ZIF-67-decorated carbon nanotube (Ag NPs/ZIF-67 @CNT) hybrid, which exhibits dual-functional capabilities for both effective enzymeless glucose detection and electrocatalytic water oxidation. The distribution of Ag NPs on the ZIF-67-functionalized CNT can be optimized by adjusting the concentration of Ag+ aqueous solution during the light illumination process. The optimized Ag NPs/ZIF-67 @CNT composite showed superior glucose-sensing capability with a low determination limit of 0.46 μM (S/N = 3), high sensitivity of 469.4 μA·mM−1·cm−2, wide linearity detection range (0.010–7.0 mM) and short response time (less than 5 s). Also, the Ag NPs/ZIF-67 @CNT composite acting as potential electrocatalyst possessed an overpotential of 286 mV with a Tafel-slope of 80.75 mV dec−1 at 10 mA·cm−2 for high durability water-oxidation reaction. This work provided a feasible way to prepare Ag NPs decorated ZIF-67/CNT with modulated bifunctional catalytic performances via photochemical reduction strategy, which can also provide effective guidance for designing other multifunctional electrocatalysts.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Graphene-supported polyoxometalate entrapped in a MIL-88A network with highly efficient conversion of polysulfides in Li-S batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.It has been demonstrated that polyoxometalates (POMs) have strong anchoring abilities with efficient catalysis of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). However, the severe aggregation that buries the effective active sites of POMs along with poor electrical conductivity limits the practical application of POMs in lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs). In our strategy, we utilized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to support a POM catalyst entrapped in a MIL-88A(FeCo) network with a hollow shell skeleton as the sulfur host material. H4PW11VO40 (PW11V) with optimal vanadium atom implantation ensures the ruggedness and integrity of the hollow structure, which is conducive to achieving high sulfur loading as well as accommodating the volume change of the sulfur cathode during the charging and discharging process. Importantly, PW11V can capture polysulfides through firm chemical adsorption and accelerate redox reactions of LiPS conversion by effective electrochemical catalysis. Furthermore, the satisfactory electrical conductivity of rGO provides access for electrons to reach the interface of PW11V and polysulfides and trigger Li-S conversion reactions. Thus, the constructed PW11V-based sulfur cathode exhibited a superior specific capacity of 905 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles under 0.2 C and long cycling life with a capacity recession rate of 0.046% for each cycle upon 500 cycles under 3 C.

In this study, N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) and Co/N-CNT catalysts are synthesized by grinding and subsequent calcination, and the whole process does not require strict control of the reaction conditions, thus greatly simplifying the synthesis route of the catalysts. The unique structure, in which Co nanoparticles are evenly embedded in the tube and tip of CNTs, exhibits outstanding ORR performance and electrochemical stability as a result of the Co-CNT interactions. Furthermore, due to the catalytic graphitization ability of Co nanoparticles, a high graphitization degree, large specific surface area, and abundant pore structure are achieved by adjusting the calcination temperature, thus accelerating electron transfer and oxygen diffusion.

Here we report a nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanosheet decorated with nickel-copper alloy nanoparticles (NiCu@NHPC), which can be fabricated in large quantities using lactose and nitrate as precursors via a simple two-step carbonization strategy. No external template or pore-forming agent was used in the preparation process. The structural characterizations reveal that monodisperse NiCu alloy nanoparticles are tightly embedded into the porous carbon framework. Benefiting from its outstanding structure feature, the NiCu@NHPC hybrid exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance. Specifically, the NiCu@NHPC hybrid as supercapacitor electrode material displays a high specific capacity up to 1175 C g-1 at 1 A g-1 and a good rate performance. Meanwhile, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor device NiCu@NHPC//NHPC delivers a desirable energy density of 61.33 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 960 W kg-1 and a long-term cycle life.

However, MXenes suffer from sheet stacking and partial surface oxidation, limiting their energy storage and water treatment development. To solve these problems and enhance the performance of MXenes in practical applications, various hierarchical MXene/transition metal oxide (MXene/TMO) heterostructures are rationally designed and constructed.

MOF-derived MoP nanorods decorated with a N-doped thin carbon layer as a robust lithiophilic and sulfiphilic nanoreactor for high-performance Li-S batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are severely hindered by low sulfur utilization and short cycling lives, especially at high sulfur loading levels. An effective solution to address these problems is to improve the sulfiphilicity of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and the lithiophilicity of the lithium anode. However, it is a great challenge to simultaneously optimize both aspects. To solve these problems, herein, a modification strategy involving a functional separator is used, coating a composite including MoP nanorods decorated with a N-doped thin carbon layer (MoP@NC) and porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) onto the surface of a Celgard separator. The obtained MoP@NC material, derived from a molybdenum-based MOF (Mo-MOF), possesses abundant porosity and multiple catalytic sites, with uniform and stable rod-shaped morphology. The PCNFs and N-doped thin carbon layer can effectively alleviate volume expansion, buffer the electrolyte, and trap LiPS. When applied as a modification layer coated on the separator, the MoP@NC/PCNFs-based cell with optimized lithiophilicity and sulfiphilicity enables desirable sulfur electrochemistry, including high reversibility of 902.9 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 1C and 654.5 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2C.

Monolayer H-MoS2 with high ion mobility as a promising anode for rubidium (cesium)-ion batteries,"© 2022 The Author(s).Secondary ion batteries rely on two-dimensional (2D) electrode materials with high energy density and outstanding rate capability. Rb- and Cs-ion batteries (RIBs and CIBs) are late-model batteries. Herein, using first-principles calculations, the potential performance of H-MoS2 as a 2D electrode candidate in RIBs and CIBs has been investigated. The M-top site on 2D H-MoS2 possesses the most stable metal atom binding sites, and after adsorbing Rb and Cs atoms, its Fermi level goes up to the conduction band, indicating a semiconductor-to-metal transition. The maximal theoretical capacities of RIBs and CIBs are 372.05 (comparable to those of commercial graphite-based LIBs) and 223.23 mA h g−1, respectively, due to the strong adsorption capability of H-MoS2 for Rb and Cs ions. Noticeably, the diffusion barriers of Rb and Cs on H-MoS2 are 0.037 and 0.036 eV, respectively. Such a low diffusion barrier gives MoS2-based RIBs and CIBs high rate capability. In addition, H-MoS2 also has the characteristics of suitable open-circuit voltage, low expansion, good cycle stability, low cost, and easy experimental realization.

Here, a nitrogen-doped graphene-supported bimetallic palladium-copper composite catalyst (Pd3Cu1/N-rGO) was prepared by heat-treating the aniline monomer and graphene oxide polymer, followed by supporting palladium-copper metal particles. The change in the structure and surface state of the carbon matrix can effectively control the particle size and dispersion of alloy particles and improve the catalytic performance of the catalyst to reduce the amount of palladium. The alloy nanoparticles of the prepared Pd3Cu1/10N-rGO-800 composite catalyst material are about 1.75 nm in size and the Pd content is less than 10%, which demonstrates an excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance with a mass-normalized current density of 2.35 times that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt % Pt), mainly a four-electron transfer process, and higher catalytic stability than commercial platinum carbon (Pt/C). Most importantly, the prepared catalyst showed better methanol tolerance and much higher stability, and Pd3Cu1/10N-rGO-800 is used as a cathode catalyst material in a zinc-air battery; it presents a higher peak power density (164.39 mW/cm2) and faster discharge performance. The N-doped graphene facilitated the dispersion of the Pd-Cu nanoparticles, effectively reduced the size of alloy particles, maximized the exposure of active sites on the surface, and improved the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen reduction.

However, LIBs still cannot meet all the essential demands of rapidly growing new industries. In pursuance of higher energy requirement, metal batteries (MBs) are the next-generation high-energy-density devices. Li/Na metals are considered as an ideal anode for high-energy batteries due to extremely high theoretical specific capacity (3860 and 1165 mAh g−1 for Li and Na, respectively) and low electrochemical potential (−3.04 V for Li and −2.71 V for Na vs. standard hydrogen electrode). Unfortunately, uncontrolled dendrite growth, high reactivity, and infinite volume change induce severe safety concerns and poor cycle efficiency during their application. Consequently, MBs are far from commercialization stage. This Review represents a comprehensive overview of failure mechanism of lithium/sodium metal anode and its progress for rechargeable batteries through (i) electrolyte optimization, (ii) artificial solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formation, and (iii) nanoengineering at materials level in current collector, anode, and host.

Enhancing the ORR activity of fullerene-derived carbons by implanting Fe in assembled diamine-C60 spheres,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Fullerene-derived carbons have been demonstrated as effective electrode materials for electrocatalytic reactions. The rational arrangement of heteroatoms in the carbon structure is essential to yield high catalytic activity. Herein, assembled diamine-C60 spheres (N@FSs) were fabricated and used to control the implanting of Fe components. The confinement effect from fullerene superstructures and the strengthened binding of Fe ions by the amine groups ensure the formation of porous carbon spheres (FeN@FCSs) with a high doping amount of Fe and N simultaneously.

Inspired by ternary lithium batteries, multielement chalcogenide compounds with integrated advantages may improve upon the performance of lithium-chalcogenide batteries at the source. In this work, activated carbon (AC) with an Al2O3@SiO2 heterojunction is used as the carrier, and the performances and mechanisms of elemental substances (X/AC, X = S, Se, and Te) are studied in ether and ester electrolytes as the basis for preparing multielement chalcogenide composites (SST/AC, SST: S-Se-Te compound). In the ester electrolyte system, SST811/AC (where S/Se/Te = 8:1:1, molar ratio) exhibited the best cycling performance, and the capacity remained at 1024.9 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles. The characterization results revealed the mechanisms and sequences of the gradual liquid-phase reactions of SST/AC in ether electrolytes and the direct solid-phase reactions in ester electrolytes.

Thiol-Containing Metal-Organic Framework-Decorated Carbon Cloth as an Integrated Interlayer-Current Collector for Enhanced Li-S Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries hold great promise for new-generation energy storage technologies owing to their overwhelming energy density. However, the poor conductivity of active sulfur and the shuttle effect limit their widespread use. Herein, a carbon cloth decorated with thiol-containing UiO-66 nanoparticles (CC@UiO-66(SH)2) was developed to substitute the traditional interlayer and current collector for Li-S batteries. One side of CC@UiO-66(SH)2 acts as a current collector to load active materials, while the other side serves as an interlayer to further restrain polysulfide shuttling. This two-in-one integrated architecture endows the sulfur cathode with fast electron/ion transport and efficient chemical confinement of polysulfides. More importantly, rich thiol groups in the pores of UiO-66(SH)2 serve to tether polysulfides by both covalent interactions and lithium bonding. Therefore, the Li-S battery equipped with this integrated interlayer-current collector not only delivers an enhanced specific capability (1209 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C) but also exhibits prominent cycling stability (an attenuation rate of 0.037% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 1 C). Meanwhile, the battery achieves a high discharge capacity of 795 mAh g-1 at a sulfur loading of 3.83 mg cm-2. The new metal-organic framework (MOF)-based electrode material reported in this study undoubtedly provides insights into the exploration of functional MOFs for robust Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
A permselective and multifunctional 3D N-doped carbon nanotubes interlayer for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHere in-situ Raman indicates that the shuttle effect induced by polysulfides occurs during the whole discharge and charge process in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs), leading to irreversible loss of sulfur and generation of lithium dendrites. To solve the above problems, we construct a N-doped carbon nanotubes/carbonized cellulose paper (IF-N-CNTs-CCP) with three-dimensional conductive network structure through noncovalent modification assisted high-temperature carbonization. IF-N-CNTs-CCP interlayer can effectively block the shuttle effect by strong chemisorption and physical barrier, improving the utilization of sulfur. However, it doesn't prevent the free migration of lithium ions, resulting in a remarkable acceleration of electrochemical reaction kinetics. Moreover, the three-dimensional IF-N-CNTs-CCP interlayer can provide a large number of lithiophilic sites and significantly reduce the regional current density, thus inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites, enhancing the safety of LSBs. As a result, the LSBs with IF-N-CNTs-CCP interlayer deliver a negligible capacity fading rate of 0.037% per cycle after 500 cycles at 2.0 C, and a high-capacity retention of 95% at 0.2 C with a sulfur loading of 3 mg/cm2 with a correspondingly lean electrolyte condition (E/S ratio = 6 µL/mg). This work provides an effective strategy for the application of functional interlayer in LSBs, which can suppress the shuttle effect and lithium dendrite.",Electrochimica Acta
VSe2/MXene composite with hierarchical three-dimensional structure encapsulated in dopamine as an anode for potassium-ion batteries,"© 2022Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) receive intensive interest because of the natural abundance of potassium sources and their potency to achieve high energy density. VSe2 is one of the promising electrode materials equipped with a huge interlayer distance, which can accommodate more K+ ions and reduce the structural distortion caused by the diffusion of K+ ions. But the problem of self-aggregation of VSe2 hinder its further application. Therefore, taking advantage of excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical strength of MXene, VSe2/MXene@C composites with a hierarchical three-dimensional structure are designed. Especially, VSe2 nanosheets are anchored on MXene substrates by strong covalent bonds, bridging with an oxygen atom. In addition, coating the carbon layer can avoid the deterioration of VSe2/MXene and improve the capacity and cycling stability of batteries effectively. As a result, the VSe2/MXene@C exhibits an excellent reversible capacity of 302.4 mAh g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 99.49% at 200 mA g−1 after 200 cycles, long-term cycling performance of 138.7 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 500 cycles, and superior rate performance of 106.9 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1. With outstanding electrochemical performance, the VSe2/MXene@C shows promise to become an excellent anode material for potassium-ion batteries(PIBs).",Electrochimica Acta
Decoupling layer metal-organic frameworks via ligand regulation to achieve ultra-thin carbon nanosheets for oxygen reduction electrocatalysis,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.2D imidazole MOFs are considered to be ideal carbon precursors for oxygen reduction reactions owing to their adjustable ligand components and durable coordination mode. Due to the massive electron delocalization in the lamella, the conjugative effect among 2D MOF layers immensely restricts the exposure of catalytic sites after carbonization, which makes the decoupling layer extremely important on the premise of ensuring activity. Herein, atomic thickness ultra-thin zinc-imidazole MOF precursors were prepared through a bottom-up ligand regulated strategy to achieve the aim of lamellar decoupling. The introduction of heterologous ligands excites stable delocalized electrons, resulting in a decrease in the interlayer force of 2D zinc-imidazole MOF precursors. Subsequent salt template-supported ammonia pyrolysis assisted the MOF-derived carbon sheets to grow along the transverse direction and optimize pore size distribution as did the doping nitrogen type. The MOF-derived carbon sheets demonstrated increasing mesopores and fringe graphitic N which could significantly promote the mass transfer and electron transfer speed during the oxygen reduction reaction. In addition, the obtained ultra-thin carbon delivered an outstanding onset potential (0.98 V vs. RHE) and durability (retaining 91% of the initial current after 12000 s of operation), showing tremendous commercial prospects in sustainable energy.",Nanoscale

Herein, we present a strategy to confine heterostructured SnSe2-SnO2 nanoparticles into macroscopic nitrogen-doped carbon microbelts (SnSe2-SnO2@NC) as anode materials for LIBs. The composites exhibit an excellent specific capacity of 436.3 mA h g−1 even at 20 A g−1 and an ultrastable specific capacity of 632.7 mA h g−1 after 2800 cycles at 5 A g−1. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations reveal that metallic SnSe2-SnO2 heterostructures endow the lithium atoms at the interface with high adsorption energy, which promotes the anchoring of Li atoms, and enhances the electrical conductivity of the anode materials. This demonstrates the superior Li+ storage performance of the SnSe2-SnO2@NC microbelts as anode materials.",Dalton Transactions

Black phosphorene/NP heterostructure as a novel anode material for Li/Na-ion batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Designing heterostructured anode materials has been rendered supremely appealing to large-scale energy storage systems and storage device researchers. Recently, black phosphorene has experienced explosive development and been sought for widespread application in various domains including anode materials for electrochemistry. Hence, in this work, the black phosphorene/NP heterostructure (black P/NP) as a novel anode material for Li/Na batteries was systematically studied on the basis of first-principle calculations. Our simulations disclose that black P/NP is dynamically stable at room temperature and exhibits metallic properties. Charge density difference calculations and work function analysis demonstrate that electron charge transfer between the pristine single-layer components leads to enhanced Li/Na ion adsorption on the interlayer. To be specific, the calculated adsorption energies for Li/Na are −2.27 and −2.13 eV, respectively, which are sufficient to prevent metal aggregation during cycling. Besides, it is predicated that black P/NP has a positive and low open-circuit voltage. Excitingly, the diffusion barriers for Li and Na ions on black P/NP are 0.17 and 0.04 eV, respectively, which are superior to other typical heterostructures. Our results may be a new paradigm and reference for phosphorene-based heterostructures used as electrode materials of metal-ion batteries.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Simply constructed highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles in diverse N-doped graphitic carbon with remarkable performances for water electrolysis,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCMetal/carbon composite materials are highly promising electrocatalysts for water electrolysis. In this work, three composites of metal cobalt nanoparticles highly dispersed in N-doped carbon materials were facilely constructed by pyrolysis of different phenylenediamine based Schiff base-Co complexes (PDBs). Interestingly, the composites derived from PDBs based on different phenylenediamine exhibited different morphologies. The superior case is that rodlike composite catalyst was derived from o-phenylenediamine based PDBs. The obtained catalyst exhibited remarkable performances for both cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as overall water electrolysis. Only 172 and 289 mV of overpotentials and 1.57 V of cell voltage were exhibited at 10 mA cm−2 for HER, OER and water splitting in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. The catalyst also displayed robust stability and high Faraday efficiency, and thus are potential high-performance catalyst for commercial water electrolysis.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
Rapid and Specific Enhanced Luminescent Switch of Aniline Gas by MOFs Assembled from a Planar Binuclear Cadmium(II) Metalloligand,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Due to the low vapor pressure of aniline, it is challenging to develop a specific rapid fluorescence detection material for low concentrations of aniline gas, which is suspected to result in carcinogenicity when people are exposed by ingestion, inhalation, and skin contact. Herein, the easy-preparing Schiff base ligands were employed to construct the binuclear cadmium(II) compounds featuring a good plane and fine luminescent property, and then, the end groups were changed, making the compounds metalloligands to further build the 3D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), named MECS-2. It is found that MECS-2 can achieve specific luminescent enhancement response for aniline gas. Furthermore, a large-scale MECS-2a film could be easily prepared by electrospinning nanoMECS-2, which presents the highly efficient and visual detection for aniline gas with the luminescent enhancement effect up to 20 times and good repeatability. Our work provides a good example for the efficient construction of MOF-based films with the fluorescence detection function for organic aromatic gases.",Inorganic Chemistry
Evaluating the potential of graphene-like boron nitride as a promising cathode for Mg-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The electrochemical characteristics and magnesium (Mg) storage of a graphyne-like boron nitride (G-BNyen) monolayer are fully investigated as an electrode material for Mg-ion batteries (MIBs) by utilizing density functional theory computations. The computed density functional theory results show that the internal energy change as well as the cell voltage values for MIBs with the G-BNyen cathode are higher compared to carbon nano-materials. It is shown that the Mg is primarily adsorbed onto the center of a hexagonal and triangular ring of the G-BNyen with 1.94 and −0.59 eV adsorption energies respectively. There is a decrease in the energies of adsorption as well as the cell voltage after an increase in the Mg atoms’ concentration over the G-BNyen. The lower values (0.12–0.27 eV) related to the diffusion barrier confirm that the Mg mobility in the 2-D nano-sheet is faster. The G-BNyen shows the maximum theoretical capacity of roughly 939.16 mA h.g−1. The results are evaluated according to charge transport, structural, energetic, as well as electronic characteristics and provide insights into building better anode materials with higher capacity for MIBs.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry

The ammonia yield rate and Faradaic efficiency of NIRR catalyzed by Pd10Cu/BCN constructed with structural constraints and pre-embedded reducing agent strategies were as high as 102,153 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and 91.47%, respectively. Pd10Cu/BCN can remove nearly 100% of 50 mg L−1 NO3- without NO2- residue within 10 h, and the realization of this effect does not require the participation of any chloride. Control experiments and DFT calculations explain the efficient operation mechanism of NIRR on Pd10Cu/BCN, where the Pd and CuN4 sites play the role of synergistic catalysis.

"One-step preparation, characterization and adsorption property of mesoporous nickel sulfides in deep eutectic solvent","© 2022In this paper, single and mixed-phase mesoporous nickel sulfides (including α-NiS/β-NiS/Ni3S4, Ni3S4, Ni3S4/NiS2 and NiS2) are prepared in choline chloride-ethylene glycol deep eutectic solvent (ChCl-EG DES) under normal atmosphere. In the preparation processes, the ChCl-EG DES plays dual roles as solvent and template. The effects of NiSO4·6H2O, Na2S2O3·5H2O and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid concentrations on the phase, morphology, element composition and specific surface area of the products are examined. The results show that pompon-like, cauliflower-like, botryoid and nanospherical nickel sulfides can be obtained by controlling the concentration of the reactants. Their specific surface areas are 4.063 m2/g, 5.138 m2/g, 4.533 m2/g and 52.135 m2/g, respectively. The reaction mechanism for the preparation of nickel sulfides in ChCl-EG DES is also elaborated. In addition, the adsorption property and mechanism of nickel sulfides are assessed with methylene blue (MB) as target organic pollutant.

Their maximum adsorption capacity for MB are 20.39 mg g−1, 19.56 mg g−1, 21.38 mg g−1 and 24.38 mg g−1, respectively.",Ceramics International
Ultrathin microporous carbon/few-layer graphene heterostructure for supercapacitor application,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The heterostructure consisting of ultrathin microporous carbon and graphene can exhibit many interesting properties benefiting from their unique physicochemical structure, and thus possess a great potential application in electrochemical energy storage devices. Herein, we report a novel catalysis strategy to construct nanometer-thick microporous carbon/few-layer graphene (FLG) heterostructure in the tens-of-nanometer-thick shells of hollow carbon spheres (HCSs). The thickness of microporous carbon in heterostructure can be reduced by intercalating more FLG sheets. Nano-sized thickness increases exposure ratio of micropores and shortens ion transport distance besides good conductivity of FLG sheets. The meso- and macropores in heterostructure further improves ion adsorption of high-density open micropores. The obtained ultrathin microporous carbon/FLG heterostructure shows high special capacitance (Cs) of 187 F·g−1 at 5.0 mV·s−1 and excellent rate capability. Furthermore, the loading of heterostructure electrode increases by 15 times, the Cs is up to 192 F·g−1 at 5.0 mV·s−1 with more excellent rate performance and robust long-term charge-discharge recyclability. After the loading mass increased by 29 times (2.85 mg·cm−2), the electrochemical performance still remains stable, indicating a great potential for supercapacitor application.

Bipolar CoSe2 nanocrystals embedded in porous carbon nanocages as an efficient electrocatalyst for Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The confinement and catalysis properties of orthorhombic CoSe2 as a host material for Li-S battery are studied by theoretical and experimental methods. First-principles calculations show that the (111) surface of CoSe2 possesses adjacent nucleophilic and electrophilic centers. This bi-polar surface can easily bond the polysulfide molecules and catalyze their conversion reactions. As a result, the decomposition energy barriers of polysulfides are greatly decreased from ∼3.0 eV to 0.2–0.4 eV. Following theoretical prediction, CoSe2 nanocrystals with specific (111) surface are prepared and embedded in porous carbon nanocages using ZIF-67 metal organic framework as a template. Benefited from the advantages of porous C and CoSe2 (111) surface, the shuttling of polysulfides is suppressed and their conversion kinetics is facilitated.

Polymer nanofibers framework composite solid electrolyte with lithium dendrite suppression for long life all-solid-state lithium metal battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The widespread deployment of lithium metal battery is limited by inhomogeneous electrodeposition of lithium metal (the growth of lithium dendrite), leading to pulverization, “dead” lithium and the unrestricted volume expansion of lithium metal anode. Owing to the high elastic modulus, thermal stability and electrochemical stability of polyimide, we design a novel composite solid polymer electrolyte blending with polyimide fibers framework paper. Polyimide fibers scaffold improves elastic modulus and tensile strength of composite electrolyte film. Effective ion transport network layers in electrolyte system are formed by adding polyimide fibers due to strong interaction between electron-withdrawing atoms and groups in the lithium salt for accelerating the dissociation of the lithium salt. Thus, polyimide composite electrolyte shows higher Li+ transfer number (∼2 times) than pure polyethylene oxide electrolyte, which is beneficial to regulate Li deposition for lithium dendrites inhibition. The electrochemical window of polyimide composite electrolyte is widened to 4.87 V after introducing stable physicochemical fibers framework, leading to high compatibility and stability with lithium metal anode. Therefore, the Li symmetrical battery with polyimide fibers framework composite electrolyte delivers low overpotential and long cycling life at different current densities. And the all-solid-state Li/LiFePO4 battery using this composite electrolyte reveals long cycling life (418 cycles), high Coulomb efficiency (99.97%), high capacity retention of 89.5% at 0.3 C, and good rate performance at 60 °C.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Impact of ultrathin coating layer on lithium-ion intercalation into particles for lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Ultrathin film coatings on battery materials via atomic layer deposition (ALD) have been demonstrated as an efficient technology for battery performance enhancement. However, the fundamental understanding on lithium intercalation into active materials through the interface between the coating and active materials is unclear, which makes it difficult to optimize ALD coating strategies. Further, like most active materials, a coating layer can undergo volume change during the intercalation process, which can produce detrimental structural changes and mechanical failure of the layer. In this work, first-principles calculations are conducted to reveal the behavior of a coating layer on an active material particle by focusing on the intercalation energy variation, lithium-ion transport, electron chemical potential change, and structural changes of the coating layer. The analysis comprehensively explains an experimental observation that a CeO2 coating on LiMn2O4 particles exhibits better performance in capacity and cycling than an Al2O3 coating on the same particles. The fundamental knowledge imparted from this work provides an important understanding about the beneficial role of ALD coatings in lithium-ion battery performance and capacity retention.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Cobalt-intercalated one-dimensional nanocrystals of urea perylene imide polymer for enhanced visible-light photocatalytic water oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Urea perylene imide polymer (UPDI) is successfully recombined with Co(NO3)2 molecules into one-dimensional nanocrystals (Co−UPDI) for enhanced photocatalytic oxygen evolution (POE) under visible light. Co−UPDI as photocatalyst exhibits more an order of magnitude of POE rate than UPDI at pH = 4.8 (8.00 vs. 0.58 mmol h−1g−1), which is the highest among reported POE tests in aqueous colloid system with AgNO3 as sacrificial agent. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) reaches 4.39 % at 450 nm. The systematical experiments reveals that the heterojunction formation between UPDI line and Co(NO3)2 molecules is crucial through the coordination of Co with N atoms. Consequently, the rigidity of UPDI line enhances, H−type stacking of PDI moiety becomes closer, and CoOOH as cocatalyst in-situ forms during POE. Meanwhile, more excitons with longer lifetime generate and more quickly transfer in Co−UPDI than UPDI nanocrystals. This work provides an efficient strategy for photocatalytic water oxidation.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

The roles and functions of Vse in the reaction system are deeply elucidated. Strikingly, systematic characterization and theoretical calculations revealed that Vse can modulate the surface electronic structure and accelerate Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle, leading to the strengthened binding energy and accelerated charge deliver for PMS activation. Accordingly, Iohexol (15 mg/L) can be eliminated within 30 min in FeSe2−x @C-5/PMS system, with apparent reaction rate constant (kapp) 23.7 times higher than that in FeSe2/PMS system.

First-Principles Core Spectroscopy of LiCoO2and CoO2,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.X-ray absorption spectroscopy is one of the most effective techniques to characterize the evolution of battery materials via in situ and operando measurements. Ab initio calculations complementing such experiments can crucially contribute to interpret these results and to gain insight into the microscopic properties of these complex systems. In this work, we adopt state-of-The-Art methods based on all-electron density-functional theory and many-body perturbation theory to investigate core spectroscopy in LiCoO2and in its binary counterpart CoO2. In doing so, we consider excitations from the Co K-and L23-edges as well as from the O K-edge. Our results, in good agreement with available experimental data, reveal that excitonic effects play a negligible role in the X-ray absorption spectra of these materials. Their spectral fingerprints are well reproduced already in the independent-particle approximation, and, on a qualitative level, they can be traced back from the corresponding contributions in the projected density of states. These findings suggest that monitoring the electronic structure of LiCoO2during the delithiation process is sufficient to capture the evolution of their X-ray absorption signatures without the need for expensive many-body calculations. As such, our findings support the use of high-Throughput calculations for the identification of X-ray spectral fingerprints in these systems.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C

Herein, a unique 3D/2D sulfur doped (S-doped) porous Ti3C2Tx@ZnIn2S4 heterostructure is rationally constructed by decorating 2D ZnIn2S4 nanosheets on 3D S-doped Ti3C2Tx architectures via an S sacrificial template and an in situ growth strategy. The 3D/2D S-doped Ti3C2Tx@ZnIn2S4 heterostructure possesses hierarchically porous scaffold configurations, a 3D interconnected conductive network, and abundant surface-terminated active groups, which greatly shorten the electron transport pathway and expose more catalytic active sites. Furthermore, according to experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, the S dopant synergistically participates in modulating electrons, triggering the unsaturated sites, and optimizing *H adsorption energy (ΔGH*). More importantly, the intimate Ti-S interface establishes an electron directional transport channel, thus achieving valid and stable interfacial electron transport. Consequently, the optimal heterostructure photocatalyst exhibits a high photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 3.058 mmol g−1 h−1, which is 3.8 times higher than that of the pure ZnIn2S4 nanosheet. Additionally, such a robust 3D architecture ensures the stability of photocatalytic H2 evolution.

Rational design of the FeS2/NiS2 heterojunction interface structure to enhance the oxygen electrocatalytic performance for zinc-air batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Fine design of nanostructures of bifunctional electrocatalysts and developing low-cost, efficient and durable electrocatalytic materials are important directions for the development of sustainable energy storage and conversion devices such as electrolytic water and metal-air batteries. In this work, nickel-iron layered sulfide hollow double-shell nanorods were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal self-templating process followed by a high-temperature sulfurization process. Benefiting from the large electrochemically active surface area of the layered nanosheets, the electronic regulation of the FeS2/NiS2 heterogeneous interface, and the mechanical support of the hollow core-shell structured nanorods, the synthesized FeS2/NiS2 hollow multi-shell nanorods with an open layered array structure (FeS2/NiS2 HDSNRs) show better electrocatalytic performance than the single component FeS2 and NiS2 electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolyte solution. In 1.0 M KOH solution for the oxygen reduction reaction, the FeS2/NiS2 HDSNRs electrocatalyst has a half-wave potential of 0.80 V vs. RHE and an overpotential of only 280 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm−2 for oxygen evolution reaction and the Tafel slope is only 33 mV dec−1. The FeS2/NiS2 HDSNRs electrocatalyst used as the cathode of a liquid zinc-air battery showed a peak power density of 130 mW cm−2 and a charge-discharge cycle life of 480 h at a current density of 5 mA cm−2, with a voltage gap of only 0.92 V. In addition, the assembled solid-state zinc-air battery also exhibits a charge-discharge cycle life of 11 h at a current density of 5 mA cm−2, and two solid-state batteries connected in series can also drive LED lights.

Green Crop Yam-Derived Carbons: Off-Plane Active Sites for Oxygen Electroreduction Identified by First-Principles,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Plant-derived nonprecious metal catalysts are considered one of the promising candidates of platinum for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this work, the typical microscopic morphology of fresh green crop yam is first detected by cryoscanning electronic microscopy. Using the green and widely sourced yam with spherical starch in nature as a precursor, well-defined spherical carbons are prepared via hypersaline-assisted hydrothermal carbonization and NH3activation, featuring a high heteroatom doping level and a hierarchical porous structure. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that diverse off-plane Fe-Nx-Cyensembles on the spherical carbons trigger the high performance that exceeds state-of-art Pt/C and most reported carbon catalysts toward ORR in a KOH solution. The increased charge density and the bond length of Fe coordinated in the sites should be responsible for the significantly improved property. The easily editing of off-plane active sites from the simple carbon morphology may shed light on optimizing nonprecious carbons as next-generation catalysts for ORR.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Two Dimensional MOene: From Superconductors to Direct Semiconductors and Weyl Fermions,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The number of semiconducting MXenes with direct band gaps is extremely low; thus, it is highly desirable to broaden the MXene family beyond carbides and nitrides to expand the palette of desired chemical and physical properties. Here, we theoretically report the existence of the single-layer (SL) dititanium oxide 2H-Ti2O MOene (MXene-like 2D transition oxides), showing an Ising superconducting feature. Moreover, SL halogenated 2H- and 1T-Ti2O monolayers display tunable semiconducting features and strong light-harvesting ability. In addition, the external strains can induce Weyl fermions via quantum phase transition in 2H-Ti2OF2and Ti2OCl2monolayers. Specifically, 2H- and 1T-Ti2OF2are direct semiconductors with band gaps of 0.82 and 1.18 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the carrier lifetimes of SL 2H- and 1T-Ti2OF2are evaluated to be 0.39 and 2.8 ns, respectively. This study extends emerging phenomena in a rich family of 2D MXene-like MOene materials, which provides a novel platform for next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic fields.",Nano Letters
Facile synthesis of ultralight S-doped Co3O4 microflowers@reduced graphene oxide aerogels with defect and interface engineering for broadband electromagnetic wave absorption,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The development of modern information technology has recently put forward higher requirements for the ingenious design of electromagnetic wave absorbing (EMA) materials with a broad bandwidth at a low filling ratio. Herein, three-dimensional (3D) S-doped Co3O4 microflowers@reduced graphene oxide (S-Co3O4@RGO) aerogels are successfully prepared by interface and defect engineering with superior EMA capability. The 3D structure with a high surface-to-volume ratio can effectively avoid the agglomeration of Co3O4 and enhance the RGO-Co3O4 heterointerfaces to implement multiple reflection mechanisms. The synergistic effect of atom and phase cross-hybridization can improve defect-induced polarization centres and coherent interface-induced interface polarization. Meanwhile, the defects located at the interface have more charge transfer to enhance interface polarization than that at the interior, which is first proposed and demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Thus, the minimal reflection loss value can reach −56.7 dB (3.6 mm, 5.44 GHz) and the maximum effective absorption bandwidth is 8.48 GHz (ranging from 9.28 to 17.76 GHz) at a matching thickness of 2.3 mm with a filling ratio of 5 wt%. This work opens a new pathway to synthesize electromagnetic wave absorbents with synergistic defect and interface induced polarization loss, and has tremendous potential for EMA applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry C
Construction of Ru/FeCoP heterointerface to drive dual active site mechanism for efficient overall water splitting,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The interface engineering strategy is deemed to be a direct approach for boosting the water splitting activity of materials, but it is still a challenge to achieve both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities exceeding those of precious-metal catalysts. Herein, a tunable photodeposition method was utilized for the construction of Ru@FeCoP with rich Ru/FeCoP heterointerfaces. Strikingly, the η100 value of Ru@FeCoP was only 0.0741 V for the HER and 0.314 V for OER, which was reduced by 63.8% and 55.2% compared to Pt/C and RuO2 benchmarks, respectively. The mechanism investigation revealed that Ru at the Ru/FeCoP heterointerfaces not only offers highly active sites for HER but also pulls electrons from FeCoP, which facilitates the generation of Fe and Co with high valency, thereby increasing the OER activity. This work overcomes the problem of low water-splitting efficiency of precious metals by constructing a metal/phosphide heterostructure to drive a dual-active site mechanism and provides an effective route for the preparation of high-performance water-dissociation electrocatalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
"Plasmon-Boosted Fe, Co Dual Single-Atom Catalysts for Ultrasensitive Luminol-Dissolved O2Electrochemiluminescence Detection of Prostate-Specific Antigen","© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Improving the sensitivity of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems is highly desired for in vitro ECL diagnosis and bio-detections due to the often-low content of biomarkers in diseases. And dissolved O2(DO) as a co-reactant is considered superior to H2O2in the most commonly used luminol ECL systems due to better stability and low biotoxicity, but it still suffers from low ECL performance due to the low reactivity of DO. In this study, an efficient luminol-DO ECL system was developed through the complexing of Fe, Co dual single-atom catalysts (D-SACs) supported by N-doped graphene with the luminol-capped Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs). Benefiting from the electronic interaction between Fe and Co metal sites in the relevant D-SACs and plasmon enhancement of AgNPs, the performance of the corresponding ECL system could be significantly boosted up to ≈677-fold under optimal testing conditions, comparable to the classic luminol-O2system. Furthermore, the developed luminol-DO ECL system was successfully applied for the stable ultrasensitive detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in a wide linear range of 1 fg/mL to 1 μg/mL, with a low limit of detection (0.98 fg/mL).",Analytical Chemistry
Solvent selection criteria for temperature-resilient lithium-sulfur batteries,"Copyright © 2022 the Author(s). Published by PNAS. This article is distributed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives License 4.0 (CC BY-NC-ND).All-climate temperature operation capability and increased energy density have been recognized as two crucial targets, but they are rarely achieved together in rechargeable lithium (Li) batteries. Herein, we demonstrate an electrolyte system by using monodentate dibutyl ether with both low melting and high boiling points as the sole solvent. Its weak solvation endows an aggregate solvation structure and low solubility toward polysulfide species in a relatively low electrolyte concentration (2 mol L21). These features were found to be vital in avoiding dendrite growth and enabling Li metal Coulombic efficiencies of 99.0%, 98.2%, and 98.7% at 23 °C, 240 °C, and 50 °C, respectively. Pouch cells employing thin Li metal (50 μm) and high-loading sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (3.3 mAh cm22) cathodes (negative-to-positive capacity ratio = 2) output 87.5% and 115.9% of their room temperature capacity at 240 °C and 50 °C, respectively. This work provides solvent-based design criteria for a wide temperature range Li-sulfur pouch cells.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Mechanical and thermal properties of carbon nanotubes and boron nitride nanotubes for fuel cells and hydrogen storage applications: A comparative review of molecular dynamics studies,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCThe molecular dynamics (MD) simulation method has been widely used to study mechanical and thermal properties of nanomaterials. However, a comprehensive review that compares the thermal and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) and their hybrid structures obtained using the MD simulation method is still lacking. In this paper, we review and document the contradictory results on the mechanical and thermal properties of CNTs and BNNTs published in the literature. We identify, a critical lack of discussion in the literature concerning the thermal and mechanical properties of BNNTs and the influence of encapsulated hydrogen on these properties. We hope that future work will address some of these contradictory data obtained using the MD simulations. We also anticipated that this work would provide important insights into the mechanical and thermal characterisations of these nanotubes for hydrogen storage and fuel cells applications.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
Challenges for large scale applications of rechargeable Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.New energy storage devices have received unprecedented attention driven by the goals of carbon neutrality and carbon peaking and the deepening of the concept of green energy. Compared with lithium-ion batteries, rechargeable Zn-air batteries (RZABs) have many advantages such as high theoretical specific energy and high safety. However, zinc dendrites and sluggish OER/ORR kinetics make them hard to industrialize and apply on a large scale. In this view, we have extensively investigated the challenges faced by RZABs and efforts devoted to them such as zinc electrode treatments, solid-state electrolytes and various novel air electrodes in recent years. Then, their pros and cons and feasibility in practical applications are analyzed. Eventually, new concepts of Zn-air batteries are discussed in both energy storage batteries and power batteries, and suggestions for accelerating the large-scale application of Zn-air batteries are put forward.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

Using reverse micelles as nanoreactors, the Pd/ZIF-8 nanocomposite with a uniform size distribution is obtained. It is revealed that Pd(ii) can selectively coordinate with the (100) plane of ZIF-8. As a result, the morphology of ZIF-8 is transformed from rhombic dodecahedral to cubic. After hydrogen treatment, the as-obtained Pd NPs/ZIF-8 nanocubes show efficient catalytic activity for nitrobenzene hydrogenation, which is higher than that of the commercially available Pd/C catalyst.",Dalton Transactions
From solid waste to a high-performance Li3.25Si anode: towards high initial Coulombic efficiency Li-Si alloy electrodes for Li-ion batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.As a promising anode material for next-generation high-energy density lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), one of the main technical issues for silicon (Si) electrodes is the low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). By a pre-lithiation process, preparation of lithium-silicon (Li-Si) alloy electrodes can efficiently improve the ICE, thus leading to excellent electrochemical performance. Herein, with solid wastes as precursors, we report a cost-efficient approach for the fabrication of Li3.25Si anode materials via simple magnesiothermic reduction and then mechanical alloy reaction methods, combining the advantages of low-cost and high ICE. The prepared Li3.25Si@acetylene black (Li3.25Si@A) electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a high reversible capacity of 1138.9 mA h g−1 over 90 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and its ICE is as high as 107.7%, which is superior to that of the commercial Li3.25Si@A electrode. With a simple and low-cost manufacturing process and high ICE, the fabrication process will be definitely meaningful in achieving low-cost and high-capacity anode materials with a prolonged cycle life.",New Journal of Chemistry
Hydroxylated Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Covalently Modified with Tris(hydroxypropyl) Phosphine as a Functional Interlayer for Advanced Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.We have successfully constructed a new type of intercalation membrane material by covalently grafting organic tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine (THPP) molecules onto hydroxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT-OH) as a functional interlayer for the advanced LSBs. The as-assembled interlayer has been demonstrated to be responsible for the fast conversion kinetics of polysulfides, the inhibition of polysulfide shuttle effect, as well as the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase(SEI) layer. By means of spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis, we further found THPP plays a key role in accelerating the conversion of polysulfides into low-ordered lithium sulfides and suppressing the loss of polysulfides, thus rendering the as-designed lithium–sulfur battery in this work a high capacity, excellent rate performance and long-term stability. Even at low temperatures, the capacity decay rate was only 0.036 % per cycle for 1700 cycles.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Nitrogen-doped 3D porous graphene coupled with densely distributed CoOx nanoparticles for efficient multifunctional electrocatalysis and Zn-Air battery,"© 2022Highly efficient and low-cost multifunctional electrocatalysts play a crucial role in energy storage and conversion systems. Herein, a new strategy is developed based on a structured precursor to design and fabricate a hierarchical porous nitrogen doped graphene coupled with densely distributed CoO/Co3O4 heterostructure that exhibits outstanding multifunctional activities. With rational hybridization of graphene and bimetallic nanoparticles, the as-obtained NGPC@CoOx integrated densely distributed CoO/Co3O4 active nanoparticles to 3D interconnected hierarchical N-doped graphene mesh, which gives rise to a multifaceted capability for electron/ion transfer and redox catalyzing. The NGPC@CoOx possesses excellent durability with a superior E1/2 of 0.86 V for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and a relatively low potential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of 1.61 V, and -0.162 V at 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Additionally, the superior cycling durability and high power density of NGPC@CoOx-based zinc-air batteries (184.4 mW cm−2) further confirm the potential application of prototype devices. This work introduces a new perspective on developing efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts with a well-designed 3D structure anchored with densely distributed nanoparticles towards energy storage and conversion technologies.",Electrochimica Acta
Defect-rich porous tubular graphitic carbon nitride with strong adsorption towards lithium polysulfides for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022The commercialization of the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is severely hampered by the shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). In this study, porous tubular graphitic carbon nitride (PTCN) was synthesized as the sulfur host by hydrothermal treatment, thermal shock and etching methods. By etching technology, the hollow nanotube tentacles grow on the tube wall of PTCN, the mesoporous appears on the inner wall, and a large number of nitrogen defects are introduced. The vertically-rooted hollow nanotube tentacles on the PTCN surface facilitate electron conduction for sulfur redox reactions. The hollow and porous architecture exposes plentiful active interfaces for accelerated redox conversion of polysulfide. Furthermore, the nitrogen defects in PTCN enable more excellent intrinsic conductivity, higher adsorbability and conversion catalytic activity to LiPSs. Based on the above synergetic effect, the batteries with PTCN/S cathodes realize a high discharge capacity of 504 mAh g−1 at 4 C and a stable cycling behavior over 500 cycles with a low capacity decay of 0.063% per cycle. The results indicate a promising approach todesigning a high performance electrode material for Li-S batteries.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
The catalytic effect of RuM-C catalyst attached to carbon- based support for hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.The potential of converting traditional biomass into low-cost HER catalysts has broad application prospects. In this paper, fungus is used as a carbon-based carrier. The bimetallic catalyst RuM-C (M = V, Mo, W, Zn, Cu) was synthesized under inert gas protection at high temperature. The order of electrocatalytic activity is RuV-C > RuZn-C > RuW-C > RuMo-C > Ru-C > RuCu-C > BF-C, which indicates that RuV-C exhibits excellent HER activity. Due to its irregular sheet structure, the specific surface area of the catalyst is increased. Impressively, it exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for HER in 1 M KOH due to favorable kinetics and excellent specific activity. Consequently, the prepared RuV-C exhibited excellent and stable HER activity compared Ru-C with a low overpotential of 65.78 mV at the current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope of 45.26 mV dec-1. The potential only decreased by 88 mV after 24 h of continuous testing, which indicates that the catalyst has outstanding stability. This work will provide positive inspiration for the promotion of a new Ru-based biomass HER electrocatalyst.",Nanotechnology
Realizing fast polysulfides conversion within yolk-shelled NiO@HCSs nanoreactor as cathode host for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.A rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery has been considered a promising candidate due to its superior theoretical capacity and energy density. However, the shuttle effect from insufficient adsorption, poor diffusion-transfer, and deteriorating catalytic behavior restrain its further applications. In the present work, we report a yolk-shell NiO@HCSs nanoreactor with a nanoparticle NiO-core and a conductive carbon-shell as an Li-S battery cathode, in which sulfur is trapped in the void between the NiO-core and the carbon-shell. On the one hand, the YS NiO@HCSs structure can afford sufficient interspace for absorbing sulfur, while the nanoparticle NiO-core shows excellent adsorption ability towards LiPSs. On the other hand, the conductive carbon-shell and the yolk-shell framework with continuous pathways accelerate the dispersion and diffusion of LiPSs. More importantly, the NiO encapsulated in a yolk-shell nanoreactor serves as a metal catalytic site to accelerate the conversion of LiPSs, realizing fast adsorption-diffusion-conversion and promoting the stability of a YS NiO@HCSs electrode. As a result, the S/YS NiO@HCSs cathode displays a high discharge capacity of 1210.4 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and excellent cyclability for 300 cycles at 1C with an average capacity decay of 0.06% per cycle. This work shows an effective yolk-shell NiO@HCSs nanoreactor for enhancing LiPS conversion kinetics in high-performance Li-S batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Internal dual-emissive carbon dots for the double-signal detection of procainamide,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.We fabricated internal dual-emission carbon dots (CDs) using a facile hydrothermal treatment of eosin Y and ethylenediamine (EDA). Y-CDs exhibited distinct double peaks at 384 and 520 nm upon 320 nm excitation. The fluorescence (FL) intensities of double emissions gradually decreased along with the increase in the concentration of procainamide (PA). Since the fluorescence alteration could be monitored, Y-CDs were employed as an efficient platform for the FL sensing of PA over the linear ranges for double emissions from 4 to 18 μM and 20 to 400 μM, with a detection limit of 0.9 μM. The satisfactory accuracy and reliability in practical applications were investigated for the sensitive detection of PA in unqualified cosmetics, which took advantage of the inner filter effect (IFE) between Y-CDs and PA.",New Journal of Chemistry
Using Anion-Exchange to Induce the Formation of Edge Defects in CoNx to Enhance ORR Activity,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Developing high-efficiency non-noble metal based electrocatalysts to promote oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical for the popularization of energy conversion devices. Herein, a facile anion exchange-pyrolysis two-step strategy is reported to synthesize hierarchical CoNx/Co@NC electrocatalyst with abundant edge defects. The introduction of edge defects not only alter the configuration of N species in carbon skeleton, but also can effectively trap metal Co atoms to form CoNx sites that can afford more adsorption sites for oxygen molecules. Furthermore, the incorporation of edge defects can trigger the change of electronic structure CoNx/Co@NC, which optimize the binding energy between oxygen intermediates and catalysts. Benefit from the increased active sites and the optimized electronic structure, the obtained edge defects-rich CoNx/Co@NC demonstrates superior electrocatalytic activity, high durability and methanol tolerance with negligible decay after 40000 s, superior to Co@NC and commercial Pt/C. This job offers a valid anion exchange strategy for designing highly active non-noble metal electrocatalysts for ORR.",ChemCatChem
Landscaping Covalent Organic Framework Nanomorphologies,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The practical utilization of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with manipulation at the atomic and molecular scale often demands their assembly on the nano-, meso-, and macroscale with precise control. Consequently, synthetic approaches that establish the ability to control the nucleation and growth of COF crystallites and their self-assembly to desired COF nanomorphologies have drawn substantial attention from researchers. On the basis of the dimensionality of the COF morphologies, we can categorize them into zero- (0-D), one- (1-D), two- (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) nanomorphologies. In this perspective, we summarize the reported synthetic strategies that enable precise control of the COF nanomorphologies' size, shape, and dimensionality and reveal the impact of the dimensionalities in their physicochemical properties and applications. The aim is to establish a synergistic optimization of the morphological dimensionality while keeping the micro- or mesoporosity, crystallinity, and chemical functionalities of the COFs in perspective. A detailed knowledge along the way should help us to enrich the performance of COFs in a variety of applications like catalysis, separation, sensing, drug delivery, energy storage, etc. We have discussed the interlinking between the COF nanomorphologies via the transmutation of the dimensionalities. Such dimensionality transmutation could lead to variation in their properties during the transition. Finally, the concept of constructing COF superstructures through the combination of two or more COF nanomorphologies has been explored, and it could bring up opportunities for developing next-generation innovative materials for multidisciplinary applications.",Journal of the American Chemical Society
The interfacial effect induced by rare earth oxide in boosting the conversion of CO2 to formate,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The selectivity in the electrocatalysis of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted tremendous attention but still faces a great challenge.

Herein, we report the synthesis of a CeO2/Bi3NbO7 fibrous tubular structure through a simple electrospinning method, which has shown a much-improved selectivity of 84.73% towards formic acid with remarkable durability in the CO2RR. Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the construction interface has supplied highly electroactive regions with efficient electron transfer, which not only improves the adsorption of key adsorbates but also alleviates the reaction energy barriers. The modulation induced by the interface enables the high selectivity and yield of HCOOH.

Screening of transition metal single-atom catalysts doped on γ-graphyne-like BN sheet for efficient nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Ammonia is an important industrial raw material. To promote the production of ammonia, it is urgent to develop efficient catalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR). Here, we have reported a novel electrocatalyst: γ-graphyne-like BN sheet-supported single metal atom (M/γBN, M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Ru) for NRR and studied the effect of Hubbard U correction in single-atom catalysts. The results of adsorption show that Ti/γBN, V/γBN, and Ru/γBN have the best adsorption energy for nitrogen. A detailed analysis of the NRR mechanism indicates that V/γBN has the lowest energy barrier in the rate-determining step when it follows a distal mechanism. Further analysis shows that the superior catalytic performance in V/γBN sheet is mainly attributed to the electron donation and back-donation mechanism. More interestingly, V/γBN greatly inhibited HER selectivity. By analyzing the doping structure and adsorption system, it can be found that when considering Hubbard U correction, there will be an obvious correlation between energy and distance. This study not only provides a basis for understanding the mechanism of nitrogen reduction reaction catalyzed by single-atom catalysts but also provides a new design idea for the rational design of high-efficiency NRR catalysts.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Highly Integrated Precursor-Derived FePO4/P-Doped C 2D Nanofilm-Encapsulated Ni2P@NC Matrix as an Electrocatalyst for Energy-Saving Hydrogen Production,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The construction of environmentally friendly and efficient electrocatalysts is of great significance for energy-saving hydrogen production. Here, we fabricate a phosphate and phosphide composite-based catalyst using the highly integrated precursor 1,1′-bis (diphenylphosphino) ferrocene (DPPF) as integral P, Fe, and C sources. The catalyst was prepared via the vapor deposition process of DPPF on the precursor of 900 °C pretreated ZIF-L/NF. Under the induction of P in DPPF, Ni on NF migrates through porous NC to form Ni2P, while DPPF transforms into FePO4/PdC. Therefore, the catalyst has the structure of the FePO4/P-doped C two-dimensional nanofilm-encapsulated Ni2P@NC matrix on NF substrates (named FPPC/Ni2P@NC/NF). Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the FePO4/PdC, Ni2P, and NC matrix, the FPPC/Ni2P@NC/NF catalyst needs only 1.317 V to reach 10 mA cm-2 in urea oxidation. Moreover, it also exhibits good OER activity, which requires an overpotential of 292 mV to reach 100 mA cm-2. This work provides a novel and environmentally friendly strategy for the simultaneous construction of metal phosphate and phosphide catalysts.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
Opportunities and challenges for 2D heterostructures in battery applications: A computational perspective,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.With an increasing demand for large-scale energy storage systems, there is a need for novel electrode materials to store energy in batteries efficiently. 2D materials are promising as electrode materials for battery applications. Despite their excellent properties, none of the available single-phase 2D materials offers a combination of properties required for maximizing energy density, power density, and cycle life.

P-Ni4Mo Catalyst for Seawater Electrolysis with High Current Density and Durability,"© 2022 fjirsm, CAS, Fuzhou.Rational design of highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts with low cost to replace noblemetal based catalysts for seawater electrolysis is extremely desirable, but challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a rapid electrodeposition method by growing P-Ni4Mo on the surface of the copper foam (CF) substrate to synthesize an efficient seawater electrolysis catalyst (P-Ni4Mo/CF). The catalyst exhibited considerable HER performance and stability in alkaline seawater, with the overpotential as low as 260 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm-2. The P-Ni4Mo/CF is capable of achieving 1.0 A cm-2 with an overpotential of 551 mV, which is slightly worse than that of the Pt/C catalyst (453 mV). Moreover, P-Ni4Mo/CF demonstrates robust durability, with almost no activity loss after the durability test for more than 200 h. This work not only reports a new catalyst for seawater electrolysis, but also presents a strategy for the performance enhancement of seawater electrolysis.",Jiegou Huaxue
A Self-Supporting Cathode for In-situ Electro-Generation of H2O2 in Wide pH Range and Its Combination with UV for Carbamazepine Degradation 自支撑阴极用于宽pH 域原位产H2O2 及其耦合 UV 降解卡马西平,"© 2022 Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences. All rights reserved.Electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen for in-situ electrogeneration of H2O2 remains a challenge, but it is attractive for potential applications in advanced oxidation processes. In this study, in order to overcome the limitation of working pH for traditional Fenton and electro-Fenton processes, we successfully synthesized a self-supporting nitrogen-doped carbon material (X/N@C-CC, X=550, 750, 950) via calcination at a specified temperature, using Cd as the sacrificial metal and carbon cloth as the substrate. The cathode made with this material is capable of generating H2O2 in-situ in a wide pH range (3-10), and the combination of the cathode with UV for carbamazepine (CBZ) degradation was investigated. The results show that: (1) The prepared cathode material has high content of doped nitrogen, which is greatly affected by the calcination temperature. For the investigated temperatures, 750 ℃ is the optimal one, at which Cd is almost completely volatilized, the nitrogen content is 8.89%, and only pyridine nitrogen and graphitic nitrogen are present. In addition, the increase in calcination temperature has little effect on the oxygen content of carbon materials. (2) The C=O and —COOH functional groups are detected at all temperatures, which may guarantee the superior performance of electrogeneration of H2O2 at alkaline pH condition. (3) Under the optimum conditions, the H2O2 yield of 750/N@C-CC can reach 73.09 mg/(L·h). In addition, the coupled UV-electrocatalytic H2O2 system can completely degrade 10 µmol/L CBZ within 20 minutes at pH 3, 6, or 10. The results of free radical scavenging experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra tests show that the main oxidative species responsible for CBZ destruction is ·OH. In conclusion, this system can effectively avoid the problems of sludge production, pH limitation, and formation of toxic by-products associated with the traditional Fenton process. It shows promises for treating wastewater containing emerging organic pollutants (e.g., CBZ).",Research of Environmental Sciences

Consequently, the resulting Pt/BN-CNH catalysts present high catalytic activity, reliable long-term stability as well as strong antipoisoning capacity towards methanol oxidation, all of which are superior to those of conventional Pt/carbon black, Pt/carbon nanotube, Pt/graphene and Pt/undoped CNH catalysts, thus offering great potentials in the next-generation DMFC devices.",Journal of Materials Research and Technology
Noble Metal-Based Catalysts with Core-Shell Structure for Oxygen Reduction Reaction: Progress and Prospective,"© 2022 by the authors.With the deterioration of the ecological environment and the depletion of fossil energy, fuel cells, representing a new generation of clean energy, have received widespread attention. This review summarized recent progress in noble metal-based core–shell catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

LiPAA with Short-chain Anion Facilitating Li2Sx (x ≤ 4) Reduction in Lean-electrolyte Lithium–sulfur Battery,"© 2021 Zhengzhou University.Lean electrolyte usage in lithium–sulfur battery (LSB) meets the demand of the high energy density. However, lean condition makes the electrolyte-related interface discrete, leading to retardation of ion transfer that depends on interfaces. Consequently, electrochemical reactions face restraint. Herein, lithium polyacrylate acid (LiPAA) with short-chain anions (molecular weight of 2000) is introduced into the cathode. Because of the polysulfide (PS)-philic instinct of the short-chain PAA anions, short-chain PS is captured inside of the cathode. In addition, LiPAA supplies Li+ to the short-chain PS captured. The strong interaction between Li2S4 and LiPAA effectively decreases Li2S4 migration to the anode during discharging. In a sense, the ion mass transfer pattern is thus changed comparing to traditional long-way mode between cathode and anode. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) proves that the interfacial reaction resistance is greatly decreased in the region where Li2Sx (x ≤ 4) reduction contributes most. In the same time, the reversibility of electrochemical reduction/oxidation is improved. Owing to the accelerated Li2Sx (x ≤ 4) reduction, Li implanting of only 0.3 wt.% plus O introduction up to 1.4 wt.% enables the LSB perform well even with 1/4 of regular electrolyte dosage (5 μL mg−1) and high-sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm−2), increasing its rate capacity C0.8/0.5 from 52.6% (without the LiPAA) to 92.3% (with the LiPAA) as well as a capacity of 518.7 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles at 0.8 mA cm−2.",Energy and Environmental Materials
"Adsorption Mechanism of SO2 on Transition Metal (Pd, Pt, Au, Fe, Co and Mo)-Modified InP3 Monolayer","© 2022 by the authors.Using the first-principles theory, this study explored the electronic behavior and adsorption effect of SO2 on an InP3 monolayer doped with transition metal atoms (Pd, Pt, Au, Fe, Co and Mo). Through calculation and analysis, the optimum doping sites of TM dopants on the InP3 monolayer were determined, and the adsorption processes of SO2 by TM-InP3 monolayers were simulated. In the adsorption process, all TM-InP3 monolayers and SO2 molecules were deformed to some extent. All adsorption was characterized as chemical adsorption, and SO2 acted as an electron acceptor. Comparing Ead and Qt, the order of the SO2 adsorption effect was Mo-InP3 > Fe-InP3 > Co-InP3 > Pt-InP3 > Pd-InP3 > Au-InP3. Except for the Au atom, the other five TM atoms as dopants all enhanced the adsorption effect of InP3 monolayers for SO2. Furthermore, the analysis of DCD and DOS further confirmed the above conclusions. Based on frontier orbital theory analysis, it is revealed that the adsorption of SO2 reduces the conductivity of TM-InP3 monolayers to different degrees, and it is concluded that Pd-InP3, Pt-InP3, Fe-InP3 and Mo-InP3 monolayers have great potential in the application of SO2 resistive gas sensors. This study provides a theoretical basis for further research on TM-InP3 as a SO2 sensor.",Chemosensors
"MBenes: progress, challenges and future","© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The prevalence of MXenes, two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides/nitrides separated from layered MAX phases, has generated much interest in exploring 2D transition metal borides during the past decade. In 2017, we first reported a new family of 2D transition metal borides as analogues to MXenes and coined a catchy name for them, MBenes. Over the last five years, MBenes have gained more and more attentions in the fields of nanomaterials, physics and chemistry. The promising future of MBenes is foreseeable since they have exhibited many intriguing properties and been widely studied for energy storage and electrocatalysis applications. However, research on MBenes is still in its infancy, with many expected properties and applications awaiting to be explored. In this review, first we made a scientific classification of 2D transition metal borides and proposed an explicit definition of MBenes: a family of 2D transition metal borides with sandwich-like structures which are derived from layered MAB phases. Then we reviewed the progress of synthesis methods, properties and applications of MBenes for energy storage and electrocatalysis. Finally, the discussions on the existing problems in experimental synthesis and theoretical calculations along with the perspectives and prospects of MBenes were presented.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
A biomass-based cathode for long-life lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The AuthorsWith the advantages of high conductivity and low cost, porous carbons have been considered as the most attractive host materials of sulfur cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). However, LSBs always suffer short cycle life due to the “shuttle effect” of lithium polysulfide species (polysulfides), which are intermediate products during the charge/discharge processes. The weak interaction between carbon and polysulfides results in the dissolution of polysulfides from the cathodes, loss of active material of sulfur and eventually fast capacity fading. To overcome these drawbacks, we employed a biomass-derived carbon as the host material in sulfur cathodes. Results from X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen sorption reveals that this biomass-derived product is amorphous carbon and is composed of both large (>10 nm) and small (<5 nm) pores at an appropriate ratio. Using as hosts of cathodes in LSBs, the biomass-derived carbons deliver a high reversible capacity of >800 mAh/g and retain >80% of initial capacity after 200 cycles. Especially, the activated carbons exhibited an unprecedently high durability with 80% capacity retention after 400 cycles. The promising LSB performance can be ascribed to the unique porous architecture of biomass-derived carbons. The small pores in biomass-derived carbons provide more sites to anchor sulfur and polysulfides, while large pores provide channels for fast transport of ions. This is corroborated by the results from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and absorption measurements.",Electrochemistry Communications
Unprecedented strong and reversible atomic orbital hybridization enables a highly stable Li-S battery,"© 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of China Science Publishing and Media Ltd.The shuttle effect and excessive volume change of the sulfur cathode severely impede the industrial implementation of Li-S batteries. It is still highly challenging to find an efficient way to suppress the shuttle effect and volume expansion. Here, we report, for the first time, an innovative atomic orbital hybridization concept to construct the hierarchical hollow sandwiched sulfur nanospheres with double-polyaniline layers as the cathode material for large-scale high-performance Li-S batteries. This hierarchically 3D, cross-linked and stable sulfur-polyaniline backbone with interconnected disulfide bonds provides a new type and strong intrinsic chemical confinement of sulfur owing to the atomic orbital hybridization of Li 2s, S 3p, C 2p and N 2p. Crucially, such atomic orbital hybridization of sulfur sandwiched in the double sulfur-polyaniline network is highly reversible during the discharge/charge process and can very efficiently suppress the shuttle effect and volume expansion, contributing to a very high capacity of 1142 mAh g-1 and an excellent stabilized capacity of 886 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C after 500 cycles with a suppressed volume expansion and an unprecedented electrode integrity. This innovative atomic orbital hybridization concept can be extended to the preparation of other electrode materials to eliminate the shuttle effect and volume expansion in battery technologies. The present work also provides a commercially viable and up-scalable cathode material based on this strong and highly reversible atomic orbital hybridation for large-scale high-performance Li-S batteries.",National Science Review
Development of Cathode and Anode Materials in Lithium Sulfur Batteries 锂硫电池正极与负极材料研究进展,"© 2022, Youke Publishing Co., Ltd. All right reserved.Lithium sulfur batteries with advantages of high energy density and cost efficiency, have shown a great application prospect. However, the problems in both cathode and anode of lithium sulfur batteries have obstructed the further development. For instance, the sulfur cathode faces three main problems including the insulating nature of both sulfur and lithium sulfide, volume expansion of sulfur and the shuttle effects of lithium polysulfides. The sulfur and lithium sulfide both have low electrical and ionic conductivity resulting in sluggish electrochemical kinetics during cycling. The volume change of sulfur during charge and discharge process leads to the pulverization of the electrode structure and the exfoliation of active materials causing permanent capacity loss. The existence of lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte leads to serious capacity decay and the degradation of battery performance. In addition, lithium polysulfides can react with lithium metal leading to the destruction of anode structure. As for the lithium metal anode, the growth of lithium dendrites on the surface of anode can bring about safety problems. The formation of lithium dendrites can penetrate the separator leading to the short circuit accident. In addition to the safety problems, the ""dead lithium"" caused by the fracture of lithium dendrites decreases the capacity and Coulombic efficiency of the battery. The lithium metal anode also faces a problem that the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) growing on the surface of the anode will crack because of reiterated plating/stripping process. The problems such as the constant consumption of the electrolyte and the fresh lithium metal surface will occur because of the unstable SEI layer on the anode. Aiming at those issues, this paper summarized the research progress of electrode materials in the lithium sulfur batteries. In term of the sulfur cathode, the performance could be improved by the utilization of porous substrate as well as the construction of chemical adsorption and catalytic sites for polysulfides. The use of porous structure in the cathode which could accommodate the active materials and buffer the volume expansion of sulfur was favorable to work as the sulfur substrate. Meanwhile, the porous structure could confine the lithium polysulfides by physical interactions. However, the adsorption ability of those structures was limited and the adsorption sites which could act effectively were desirable. To improve the cycling performance of the cathode, it was essential to construct chemical adsorption sites for polysulfides. The materials with function groups, such as doping sites in the framework and polar inorganic substances, could strengthen the interactions between the cathode and polysulfides. Some materials not only interacted with lithium polysulfide strongly, but also had catalytic property to promote its conversion. These materials with both adsorption ability and catalytic function were available to gain the lithium sulfur batteries with stable cycling performance and improve the reaction kinetics of polysulfide. The design strategy for lithium anode included the improvement of anode current collector, formation of stable SEI layer and the use of solid electrolyte. The design of current collector could reduce local current density and lithium metal could deposit uniformly on the surface of anode. The formation of stable SEI layer could restrain side reactions between lithium metal and the electrolyte, which was beneficial to prevent the formation of lithium dendrites and prolong the cycle life. The use of solid electrolyte could not only increase the energy density of the battery, but also improve the safety issues. Ultimately, in the development of lithium sulfur batteries, it should focus on the combination of effective design of each part in the battery system. Consideration of the whole system could not only effectively alleviate the negative impacts on the battery performance, but also reflect synergistic effects. Thus, the performance of the battery could be improved, which made lithium sulfur batteries more practical.",Xiyou Jinshu/Chinese Journal of Rare Metals

Therefore, dissecting the difficulties and challenges faced by anode-free solid-state lithium batteries can pave the way to improving the cycle life of many lithium batteries. In this review, the key issues affecting capacity degradation are elaborated step-by-step based on the current understanding of anode-free solid-state lithium batteries. Furthermore, various strategies for optimizing performance are targeted. Finally, future opportunities and possible directions for anode-free solid-state lithium batteries are evaluated, aiming to stimulate the exploration of this emerging field.",Advanced Energy Materials
"A Comparative Review of Lead-Acid, Lithium-Ion and Ultra-Capacitor Technologies and Their Degradation Mechanisms","© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.As renewable energy sources, such as solar systems, are becoming more popular, the focus is moving into more effective utilization of these energy sources and harvesting more energy for intermittency reduction in this renewable source. This is opening up a market for methods of energy storage and increasing interest in batteries, as they are, as it stands, the foremost energy storage device available to suit a wide range of requirements. This interest has brought to light the downfalls of batteries and resultantly made room for the investigation of ultra-capacitors as a solution to these downfalls. One of these downfalls is related to the decrease in capacity, and temperamentality thereof, of a battery when not used precisely as stated by the supplier. The usable capacity is reliant on the complete discharge/charge cycles the battery can undergo before a 20% degradation in its specified capacity is observed. This article aims to investigate what causes this degradation, what aggravates it and how the degradation affects the usage of the battery. This investigation will lead to the identification of a gap in which this degradation can be decreased, prolonging the usage and increasing the feasibility of the energy storage devices.",Energies
Triggering electronic coupling between neighboring hetero-diatomic metal sites promotes hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe emerging single atom catalysts (SACs) with tailorable, uniform and well-defined metal sites provide an ideal platform for studying the atomic-level correlation between structural configuration and catalytic behavior on heterogeneous catalysis. Here we demonstrate the electronic synergy of neighboring Ir and Ni diatomic sites on carbon supports (IrNi-N-C) for promoting the hydrogen evolution. The catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity with low overpotentials (28 and 45 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and high turnover frequencies (TOFs, 3.06 and 1.40 H2 s−1 at 50 mV) in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Theoretical and experimental results suggest that the incorporation of adjacent Ni-N4 moiety increases the occupancy of Ir 5d orbitals and shifts the d-band center down in the IrNi-N-C catalyst, thus facilitating the catalytic process by the optimal intermediate binding energy. This work highlights the significance of Ni 3d-Ir 5d electronic coupling between neighboring single metal sites for catalytic activity, and paves a way for the SACs design by manipulating d-d electronic interaction except for tuning of the coordination ligands and the electronic metal-support interactions.",Nano Energy
Recent Development in Nanoconfined Hydrides for Energy Storage,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Hydrogen is the ultimate vector for a carbon-free, sustainable green-energy. While being the most promising candidate to serve this purpose, hydrogen inherits a series of characteristics making it particularly difficult to handle, store, transport and use in a safe manner. The researchers’ attention has thus shifted to storing hydrogen in its more manageable forms: the light metal hydrides and related derivatives (ammonia-borane, tetrahydridoborates/borohydrides, tetrahydridoaluminates/ alanates or reactive hydride composites). Even then, the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior faces either too high energy barriers or sluggish kinetics (or both), and an efficient tool to overcome these issues is through nanoconfinement. Nanoconfined energy storage materials are the current state-of-the-art approach regarding hydrogen storage field, and the current review aims to summarize the most recent progress in this intriguing field. The latest reviews concerning H2 production and storage are discussed, and the shift from bulk to nanomaterials is described in the context of physical and chemical aspects of nanoconfinement effects in the obtained nanocomposites. The types of hosts used for hydrogen materials are divided in classes of substances, the mean of hydride inclusion in said hosts and the classes of hydrogen storage materials are presented with their most recent trends and future prospects.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences

All rights reserved.This work presents a new strategy to enhance the charge transfer from Zr atoms in UiO-66 to black phosphorus (BP) via an atomic-level charge-transfer channel provided by Zr-P bonds for photocatalytic degradation of toluene and o-dichlorobenzene. The formation of Zr-P bonds is the key to covering BP with the UiO-66 encapsulation layer and improving the charge-transfer capability of BP-UiO, which is also verified by a series of characterization and theoretical calculations. The hydrophilic porous mesh-like UiO-66 encapsulation layer endows BP-UiO with enhanced visible-light-harvesting ability, charge transport capability, and photocatalytic activity. Additionally, BP-UiO demonstrates the promoted redox/acidity properties, significantly improving catalytic activity for the degradation of toluene and o-dichlorobenzene even in the presence of water. The degradation pathways of contaminants are investigated via the study of transient variations by in situ infrared (IR) methods, refined by the static analysis of intermates accumulated on the BP-UiO surface by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The electron transfer via bond construction and the combination of in situ IR and GC-MS are expected to provide a more complete theoretical basis for environmental catalysis.",ACS Catalysis
A Single-Atom Fe-N-C Catalyst with Ultrahigh Utilization of Active Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Fe-N-C single-atom catalysts (SACs) are emerging as a promising class of electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to replace Pt-based catalysts. However, due to the limited loading of Fe for SACs and the inaccessibility of internal active sites, only a small portion of the sites near the external surface are able to contribute to the ORR activity. Here, this work reports a metal–organic framework-derived Fe-N-C SAC with a hierarchically porous and concave nanoarchitecture prepared through a facile but effective strategy, which exhibits superior electrocatalytic ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.926 V (vs RHE) in alkaline media and 0.8 V (vs RHE) in acidic media while maintaining excellent stability. The superior ORR activity of the as-designed catalyst stems from the unique architecture, where the hierarchically porous architecture contains micropores as Fe SAC anchoring sites, meso-/macro-pores as accessible channels, and concave shell for increasing external surface area. The unique architecture has dramatically enhanced the utilization of previously blocked internal active sites, as confirmed by a high turnover frequency of 3.37 s−1 and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis with a distinct shift of adsorption edge.",Small

Preparation and characteristic analysis of carbon coated nanoscale SnO2system: An integrated experimental and first principles approach,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.A successful preparation of carbon coated (CC- SnO2)and uncoated (UC- SnO2) nanoscale SnO2 is achieved via cost-effective physicochemical method employing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the source of carbon. The idea of coating with carbon is to reduce agglomeration and investigate single particle properties. The resulting phase compositions of UC- and CC- SnO2 is characterized by XRD, Raman, TEM, UV-vis, photoluminescence, dielectric- spectroscopy and conductivity measurement. The carbon coated SnO2 finds advancement in its characteristic properties with versatility, like phase and material stability, increase in activation energy and reduction in agglomeration formation. The prepared CC- SnO2 suppresses the natural mode of vibration of SnO2 nanoparticles. Dielectric spectroscopy measurements show that the dielectric loss is more in UC- SnO2 than CC- SnO2 at all frequencies. The existence of carbon coating on SnO2 nanoparticles and its phenomenal characterizing behavior was verified by first- principles approach with investigation of the structural and electronic properties of SnO2, PVA, and their merged structures.

Rational Design of Nature Molybdenite with La2O3 Catalysts for Improved Energy-Storage Behaviors,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Natural molybdenite (MoS2) displays large interlayer distance and rich electrochemical activities, but suffers from the complex preparation process with serious pollution. MoS2, as the low-cost resources, have captured numerous attentions as first-hand energy-storage materials. However, they are still limited by the shuttling of polysulfide and side reactions. Through the in situ solution deposition and thermochemical methods, molybdenite@La2O3 is successfully prepared with the formation of Mo-S-La bonds in the interfaces. La2O3, as the important catalyst, is uniformly distributed on the surface of molybdenite, which serves vital roles in the redox reversibility. Owing to the fascinating architecture, the as-obtained samples deliver a considerable capacity of 803.1 mA h g−1, with high coulombic efficiency of 86.32%. After 500 cycles, the capacity increases up to ≈1200 mA h g−1. Even at 5.0 A g−1, its capacity can be remained ≈550 mA h g−1after 100 cycles. Assisted by the detailed kinetic behaviors, the improved energy-storage capability mainly comes from the enhancements of pseudocapacitive behaviors. Moreover, benefiting from the detailed resistance analysis, the existing of La2O3 can induce the evolution of redox reactions stability. Thus, the work is expected to provide effective modified strategy for natural molybdenite in energy-storage systems.",Advanced Materials Interfaces

Electronic Modulation of Ru Nanosheet by d–d Orbital Coupling for Enhanced Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction in Alkaline Electrolytes,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The alkaline polymer electrolyte fuel cells (APEFCs) hold great promise for using nonnoble metal-based electrocatalysts toward the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but are hindered by the sluggish anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline electrolytes. Here, a strategy is reported to promote the alkaline HOR performance of Ru by incorporating 3d-transition metals (V, Fe, Co, and Ni), where the conduction band minimum (CBM) level of Ru can be rationally tailored through strong d–d orbital coupling. As expected, the obtained RuFe nanosheet exhibits outstanding HOR performance with the mass activity of 233.46 A gPGM−1 and 23-fold higher than the Ru catalyst, even threefold higher than the commercial Pt/C. APEFC employing this RuFe as anodic catalyst gives a peak power density of 1.2 W cm−2, outperforming the documented Pt-free anodic catalyst-based APEFCs. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations suggest the enhanced OH-binding energy and reduced formation energy of water derived from the downshifted CBM level of Ru contribute to the enhanced HOR activity.",Small
Ion/Electron Redistributed 3D Flexible Host for Achieving Highly Reversible Li Metal Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.3D carbon frameworks are promising hosts to achieve highly reversible lithium (Li) metal anodes, whereas insufficient effects are attributed to their single electron conductivity causing local aggregating of electron/Li+ and uncontrollable Li dendrites. Herein, an ion/electron redistributed 3D flexible host is designed by lithiophilic carbon fiber cloth (CFC) modified with metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived porous carbon sheath with embedded CoP nanoparticles (CoP-C@CFC). Theory calculations demonstrate the strong binding energy and plenty of charge transfer from the reaction between CoP and Li atom are presented, which is beneficial to in situ construct a Li3P@Co ion/electron conductive interface on every single CoP-C@CFC. Thanks to the high ionic conductive Li3P and electron-conductive Co nanoparticles, the rapid dispersion of Li+ and obviously reduced local current density can be achieved simultaneously. Furthermore, in situ optical microscopy observations display obvious depression for volume expansion and Li dendrites. As expected, a miraculous average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.96% over 1100 cycles at 3 mA cm-2 and a low overpotential of 11.5 mV with prolonged cycling of over 3200 h at 20% depth of discharge are successfully obtained.

In this review, MOF and MOF-containing composites-based adsorbents were analyzed. The results showed that the use of composites containing MOF as hybrid materials has a high potential for use in efficient systems. The studied composites eliminated some of the shortcomings of pure MOFs. Composites improved sorption behavior, kinetics, thermal conductivity, and so on. Also, cooling system parameters showed a significant improvement over older systems (such as (I) low efficiency, II) condition of desorption, III) operation intermittent mode, and IV) low SCP and COP) when MOF composites were applied. Also, the patents were studied technically and statistically to accelerate the commercialization of MOF-based systems. The increase in the number of patents in recent years shows the importance of these modern materials. The number of MOF patents has risen sharply since 2017. Fifty-five patents have been registered in the last 20 years, of which 30 are patents from 2017 to the present (cooling systems, dryer systems, and related applications). The USA, S. Korea, China, and European Union have the most patents. AlFu, MIL-100, CAU-10, MIL-101, MOF-5, MOF-801, and UiO-66 are most applied in patents. Different methods have been used to prepare MOFs and MOF composites. Hydrothermal and solvothermal techniques are the most used in patents.

Engineering Fe and V Coordinated Bimetallic Oxide Nanocatalyst Enables Enhanced Polysulfides Mediation for High Energy Density Li-S Battery,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries are expected to become the next-generation rechargeable energy storage devices owing to their high theoretical energy density, environmental benignity, and economic benefits. However, the undesirable lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling and sluggish redox kinetics of sulfur electrochemistry severely degenerate the wide-ranging electrochemical performances, hindering the commercialization process of Li-S batteries. Herein, a Fe and V coordinated bimetallic oxide FeVO4 (denote FVO) nanocatalyst with three-dimensional (3D) ordered structure is thoughtfully tailored and cooperated with the commercialized carbon nanotubes (CNT) to modify polypropylene (PP) separator for achieving high efficiencies of restraining the LiPSs shuttling and boosting the redox conversion of sulfur species. The Fe and V coordinated bimetallic oxide demonstrates enhanced anchoring and catalyzing activities toward sulfur species than single metal oxides of Fe and V with homometallic valence states due to the reconfiguration of the 3d-band. Impressively, the Li-S pouch cell with the FVO/CNT@PP separator achieves an energy density up to 341 Wh kg−1. The bimetallic oxide nanocatalyst used in this work enlightens a new designing route toward the separator modification for the development of high energy density Li-S batteries.",Small
Revealing the role of Ni2+ ions in inducing the synthesis of porous carbon balls: A novel substrate to enhance the Pt catalytic activity towards methanol-oxidation,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCCarbon-based materials have been often employed as electrocatalytic substrates because of their large surface area/highly porous structure. Similar to carbon substrates, the non-carbon related materials such as transition metals also play an important role in improving catalytic performance. However, the simultaneous synthesis and metallic functionalization of carbon substrates is a highly challenging issue. Herein, a hydrothermal method has been used for the preparation of Ni-functionalized porous carbon balls. The significant role of Ni2+ ions in the synthesis of porous carbon balls has been confirmed. The results of transmission electron microscopy indicate that, the as-prepared porous carbon balls were suitable for the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles with small particle size (less than 4 nm). In addition to providing the OHads species, the Ni can also modify the surface electronic structure of Pt.

Construction of high-performance Li-rich Mn-based cathodes assisted by a novel water-soluble LiPAA binder,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Recently, all types of electrical equipment put forward increasing requirements on the energy density of secondary rechargeable batteries. The low specific capacity of cathode material is the primary factor that restricts the energy density of Li-ion batteries. Li-rich Mn-based cathode materials have the advantages of high specific capacity, high operating voltage, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, they have the limitations of low first Coulombic efficiency and serious capacity/voltage attenuation. In this work, lithium polyacrylate (LiPAA) has been employed as a water-soluble binder in the electrode to develop a high-performance Li-rich Mn-based cathode. The effect of the LiPAA binder on voltage drop and electrochemical performance of Li[Li0.2Co0.13Ni0.13Mn0.54]O2 cathode has been examined to reveal the modification mechanism. The results show that carboxyl group (–COOH) in the LiPAA structure can form strong hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms in the active material, making the electrode components firmly bonded and thus maintaining the structural stability of the cathode upon cycling. Moreover, the LiPAA binder can effectively inhibit voltage drop of Li[Li0.2Co0.13Ni0.13Mn0.54]O2. The discharge voltage of the electrode decreases by only 117 mV after 50 cycles. Green water-soluble LiPAA has broad prospective applications as a binder of electrode materials of secondary batteries.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics
Dual Regulation of Metal Doping and Adjusting Cut-Off Voltage for MoSe2 to Achieve Reversible Sodium Storage,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.MoSe2, as a typical 2D material, possesses tremendous potential in Na-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to larger interlayer distance, more favorable band gap structure, and higher theoretical specific capacity than other analogs. Nevertheless, the low intrinsic electronic conductivity and irreversible conversion of discharged products of Mo/Na2Se to MoSe2seriously hamper its electrochemical performance. Herein, through a facile hydrothermal method combined with calcination process, Sn-doped MoSe2nanosheets grown on graphene substrate in the vertical direction are fabricated. Benefiting from the improved electronic conductivity contributed by the abundant defects and expanded interlamellar spacing of MoSe2originated from Sn doping, combined with a smart strategy of raising discharge cut-off voltage to 0.2 V during the actual performance testing for SIBs, the as-fabricated anode material delivers superior Na-ions storage performance in terms of electrons/ions transfer, reversible sodium storage as well as cycle stability. An ultra-stable reversible specific capacity of 268.5 mAh g–1 at 1 A g–1 can be maintained after 1600 cycles. Moreover, the great sodium storage property in the SIB full-cell system of the as-obtained nanocomposite illustrates practical potential. Density functional theory calculation and in situ/ex situ measurements are employed to further reveal the storage mechanism and process of Na-ions.",Small
Catalytic effect in Li-S batteries: From band theory to practical application,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high energy density have been considered one kind of promising next-generation energy storage system. However, the shuttling effect of polysulfides caused by the intrinsic sluggish reaction kinetics severely hinders their commercialization. The catalytic effect, a powerful solution towards polysulfides shuttling by accelerating the conversion of polysulfides, has aroused great attention. Numerous catalysts have been developed and proved to have catalytic effects in the past years. More importantly, many advanced in-situ characterization technologies and electronic structure analyses have been combined to study the “black box” of the catalytic process, which promotes the practical application of Li-S batteries entering a new stage. In this review, instead of summarizing recent achievements in catalyst materials and structural designs, the key issues that how to observe, understand, design, and use catalytic effect in Li-S batteries are systematically discussed. In-situ techniques are summarized to see the actual catalytic process. Band theory is applied to understand the electronic structure, thus deciphering design principles and strategies of catalytic effect. Subsequently, how to use the catalytic effect to realize Ah-level Li-S pouch cells is analyzed. Last, we propose a research paradigm for catalytic effect, which will enlighten the future development of Li-S batteries and other next-generation batteries based on conversion reactions.",Materials Today

First-principles calculations on CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid over a metal-doped boron phosphide,"© 2022Converting greenhouse gasses into value-added products are a promising approach to protect the environment. The aim of this work is to design new path which can reduce the use of catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation and further broaden the range of applications of boron phosphide (BP) based materials. The (DFT) was used to investigate the adsorption of H2 and CO2 and their co-adsorption on a transition metal-doped hexagonal BP (M-BP with M = Al, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pd and Pt). After comparing the binding strength of M-BP to H2 and CO2, Fe-, Co- and Ni-doped BP showed the great potential as catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation. The catalytic mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation reaction was investigated in detail subsequently. It was found that the reaction proceeds through three feasible pathways: (i) path-1 (route A and B starting with the initial co-adsorption of H2 and CO2, where H2 is chemically adsorbed on M-BP, (ii) path-2 starting with the dissociation of H2, (iii) path-3 (route C and D) which starts with the co-adsorption of CO2 and H2, where the CO2 is chemically adsorbed on M-BP. Among them, Fe-BP catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation through path-1 (route B) possesses the smallest energy barrier of (0.19) eV which means that the reaction could be realized at room temperature. Furthermore, in comparison with already reported common CO2 hydrogenation catalysts, Fe-BP can be classified the high quality catalyst with very low energy barrier. These theoretical outcomes might be helpful in the removal and conversion of CO2 into chemical goods with additional value in real-world applications.",Molecular Catalysis
Self-Supporting Carbon Nanofibers with Ni-Single-Atoms and Uniformly Dispersed Ni-Nanoparticles as Scalable Multifunctional Hosts for High Energy Density Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The energy density of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) is currently hampered by modest sulfur loadings and high electrolyte/sulfur ratios (E/S). These limitations can potentially be overcome using easy-to-infiltrate sulfur hosts with high catalytic materials. However, catalytic materials in such hosts are very susceptible to agglomeration due to the lack of efficient confinement in easy-to-infiltrate structures. Herein, using carbon dots as an aggregation limiting agent, the successful fabrication of self-supporting carbon nanofibers (CNF) containing Ni-single-atoms (NiSA) and uniformly dispersed Ni-nanoparticles (NiNP) of small sizes as multifunctional sulfur hosts is reported. The NiSA sites coordinated by such NiNP offer outstanding catalytic activity for sulfur reactions and CNF is an easy-to-infiltrate sulfur host with a large-scale preparation method. Accordingly, such hosts that can be prepared on a large scale enable sulfur cathodes to exhibit high sulfur utilization (66.5 mAh cm−2 at ≈0.02 C) and cyclic stability (≈86.1% capacity retention after 100 cycles at ≈0.12 C) whilst operating at a high sulfur loading (50 mg cm−2) and low E/S (5 µL mg−1). This work provides a blueprint toward practical LSBs with high energy densities.",Small
Impact of linker/metal tuning on the performance of two-dimensional Ni3(HITP)2 MOF-based Mg ion batteries,"© 2022Porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are electrode materials for energy storage devices with some properties as examples of large surface area and high micropore volume. In this context, conductive MOFs are considered promising materials for rechargeable Mg ion batteries due to their high conductivity and the flexibility of structure engineering by tuning metals/linkers. In this research, density functional theory (DFT) studied 2-D Ni3(HITP)2 (HITP = 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11-hexaiminotriphenylene), which can be utilized as an anode in an Mg-ion battery (MIB). The calculations demonstrated that the atomic Mg adsorption on the MOF surface is unfavorable thermodynamically. Thus, the engineering of metals and linkers were also studied so that Mg/Mg2+ were preferably adsorbed on Zn3(CAT)2 (CAT = 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11-hexahedron-triphenylene) rather than the Fe3(CAT)2 and Ni3(CAT)2.; where Mg2+ interacted better than Mg. The cell voltage value produced in the MIBs using the studied structures decreased in the following order: Zn3(CAT)2 (5.19) > Ni3(CAT)2 (4.79) > Fe3(CAT)2 (4.54). The low Mg-atom diffusion barriers on the Zn3(CAT)2 (0.29 eV) surface showed a strong potential for quick charging-discharging processes. Two popular electrolytes in MIBs (THF, and diethyl ether) also have been studied from standpoints of Vcell.",FlatChem
"Bio-inspired N self-doped 3D macroporous carbon supported Pd nanoparticles as an efficient catalyst for selective hydrogenation of 1, 3-butadiene","© 2022 Taiwan Institute of Chemical EngineersBackground: The selective hydrogenation of 1, 3-butadiene values in industrial application and scientific research, and Pd catalysts are widely used in this reaction. However, it is still a challenge to achieve high butenes selectivity at a high conversion rate. Methods: Here we report the N self-doped 3D macroporous pollen-like carbon (pollen-C) derived from the biomass of rape pollen to achieve higher butenes selectivity at high conversion rates after Pd loading. Significant findings: Experimental results reveal that the properties of pollen-C, especially the content and type of N doping, will influence the particle size and the valence of the supported Pd, thereby affecting the catalytic performance. As a result of more N dopant and unique macroporous structure, the Pd/pollen-C-500 showed better butenes selectivity of 95% at 80 °C than Pd/commercial activated carbon (Pd/AC).",Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers
Metallated porphyrinic metal−organic frameworks for CO2 conversion to HCOOH: A computational screening and mechanistic study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Catalytic CO2 conversion is a promising and increasingly needed strategy to reduce carbon footprint, stockpile renewable energy in the form of fuels and high value-added chemicals. In recent years, porphyrinic metal-organic frameworks (PMOFs) have emerged as potential catalysts due to their isolated active sites, tunable structures and functionalities. Herein, we report a computational exploration for CO2 conversion into formic acid (HCOOH) on 9 metallated porphyrinic MOF-525(M) (M = CrIII, MnIII, FeIII, CoIII, NiII, CuII, ZnII, RhIII and IrIII) via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The confinement effect of MOF-525(M) framework on CO2 conversion is found to be negligible. A reaction mechanism involving H2 dissociation and subsequent CO2 hydrogenation is proposed and investigated in detail, and the former is revealed to be rate-determining. From the analysis of natural bonding orbital (NBO) charges, charge transfer among different atoms is observed during H2 dissociation and the magnitude of charge is governed by the internal charge redistribution and the spin-state of metal. Moreover, d–σ* back-donation is unraveled to be significant in H2 dissociation on MOF-525(Rh) and MOF-525(Ir). Good correlations are established between the energy barriers of H2 dissociation and certain geometric/thermodynamic properties. During CO2 hydrogenation, there is significant non-covalent interaction between CO2 and dissociated H atom, and a strong attractive interaction is revealed to be favorable for hydrogenation. All the 9 MOF-525(M) are predicted to be catalytic active over the gas-phase reaction, particularly MOF-525(Rh) and MOF-525(Ir) are screened out as the best catalysts for CO2 conversion to HCOOH. This study demonstrates the capability of metallated porphyrinic MOF-525 to catalyze CO2 conversion and would assist in the future rational design of more efficient MOFs for CO2 conversion.",Molecular Catalysis
A Natural Polymer Modified Separator as a Barrier in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries to Inhibit the Shuttle of Polysulfides,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium–sulfur batteries receive widespread attention in the past decade as a result of their high theoretical specific capacity. However, the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides produced in the battery cycle can result in low sulfur utilization and slow reaction kinetics, which seriously hinders its practical application. Herein, a carrageenan (CG)–acetylene black (AB)-modified separator for long-life Li–S batteries is proposed. The batteries with modified separator exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, fast redox kinetics (733 mAh g−1 at 6 C), and a low-capacity decay of 0.042% per cycle at 2 C. More importantly, a high reversible capacity of 805 mAh g−1 can be obtained at a high sulfur loading of 3.2 mg cm−2. The performance improvement of the separator can be attributed to the outstanding adsorbing polysulfides ability of CG and the better conductivity of AB. Combined with the natural source of CG, simple preparation process, and excellent electrochemical performance, our research results provide a kind of Li–S batteries promising modification idea.",Energy Technology

Herein, by assembling hexagonal SrFe12O19 flakes into a Ti3C2Tx MXene/MWCNT substrate, a magnetized Ti3C2Tx-based film is successfully fabricated by a facile filtration approach. Carbon nanotubes are used as isolation agents to realize the submicroscopic dispersion of MXene and SrFe12O19. The obtained MXene/MWCNTs/SrFe12O19 film shows a high electrical conductivity of 438 S cm−1 and an excellent EMI shielding effectiveness of 62.9 dB in X-band at a thickness of only 40 µm. Benefiting from a strong magnetic response ability and an expanded magnetic coupling space, hexagonal SrFe12O19 sheets can efficiently consume incident magnetic field energy by domain wall migration and the ferromagnetic resonance effect. Boosted EMI shielding performance can be achieved by improving the magnetic loss in the Ti3C2Tx MXene/MWCNTs/SrFe12O19 film, preventing the secondary reflection of electromagnetic waves. Meanwhile, magnetized MXene-based films display the freestanding and flexible features and are suitable for installation in electric devices. It is anticipated that this strategy offers new ideas for designing EMI shielding films and in broadening potential utility of MXene-based materials.",Small

A Facile Synthesis of Highly Efficient MXene Supported CoMoS Catalysts for Hydrodesulfurization,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.In this study, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATM) and 2D-layer MXene support were used to prepare more efficient MoS2 catalysts with cobalt promoter for the elimination of sulfur atoms in thiophene. A series of well-dispersed and highly active MoS2 and Co−Mo−S phase on MXene catalysts were derived by thermal activation of precursors varying promoter cobalt to molybdenum molar ratio up to 0.6. The physicochemical properties of synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, TPR, SEM/EDS, XPS, HRTEM, and Raman spectroscopy. The as-prepared MoS2/MXene and Co−MoS2/MXene catalysts were examined for thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) at 300–400 °C. The synergetic effect between Co and few-layer MoS2 on MXene, enhanced their HDS activity to ∼ 20.6 mmol g−1 h−1 with an excellent turnover frequency of about 55 h−1 achieved on Co−MoS2/MXene catalysts, which were 8-fold higher than the conventional CoMoS/alumina catalyst. Co−MoS2/MXene catalysts produce high butenes selectivity ∼73% at low temperature, whereas, at high-temperature alkane levels were increased ∼42% in CoMoS phase through hydrogen activation. Hence, the few-layer MoS2 obtained from ATM and promoter Co intercalated MXene catalysts enhances the rate of C−S bond cleavage in HDS, and the result is scrubbing a large volume of sulfur atoms in clean fuel processes.",ChemNanoMat

Nonetheless, its development is plagued by the severe polysulfide shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics. Although single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a promising remedy to expedite sulfur redox chemistry, the mediocre single-atom loading, inferior atomic utilization, and elusive catalytic pathway handicap their practical application. To tackle these concerns, in this work, unsaturated Fe single atoms with high loading capacity (≈6.32 wt%) are crafted on a 3D hierarchical C3N4 architecture (3DFeSA-CN) by means of biotemplated synthesis. By electrokinetic analysis and theoretical calculations, it is uncovered that the 3DFeSA-CN harnesses robust electrocatalytic activity to boost dual-directional sulfur redox. As a result, S@3DFeSA-CN can maintain a durable cyclic performance with a negligible capacity decay rate of 0.031% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 1.0 C. More encouragingly, an assembled Li–S battery with a sulfur loading of 5.75 mg cm−2 can harvest a high areal capacity of 6.18 mAh cm−2. This work offers a promising solution to optimize the carbonaceous support and coordination environment of SACs, thereby ultimately elevating dual-directional sulfur redox in pragmatic Li–S batteries.",Advanced Materials

Importantly, these nanoreactors storing the catalysts could be recovered and reused more than 7 times without significant loss of activity. A theoretical model for the hollow spherical reactor was further established to support the advance of the HPILs reactor, which could also help to predict reaction process in other core-shell catalytic system. Due to controlled substrate transfer and enhanced radical generation in HPILs, the reaction process could be adjusted to enhance the conversion of cyclohexane and selective oxidation to AA.",Journal of Catalysis
Bidirectional modulation interaction between monatomic Pt and Tin+ sites on Ti4O7 for high-efficiency and durable oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Although single atom catalyst (SAC) can maximize the atomic utilization, platinum (Pt)-based SAC is typically inactive to break the O = O bond in oxygen reduction. Herein, the nanoporous Ti4O7 was synthesized while Pt was atomically dispersed on the Ti4O7 surface by a one-step calcination method. The as-prepared Pt/Ti4O7 SAC exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.896 V and a mass activity of 4081.5 A/gPt at 0.9 V with negligible degradation after 20,000 cycles. Meanwhile, it exhibits a Pt utilization efficiency of 0.16 gPt kW−1 in H2/O2 fuel cell and a slight attenuation of the output current density (9.4%) after 120 h. The incorporated monatomic Pt electronically couples with the Tin+ (3 ≤ n < 4) to enhance bilateral electron transfer. The awakened Tin+ active sites synergize with monatomic Pt to moderate the adsorption intensity of O2 and dissociate the O = O bond, opening up a four-electron pathway on the Pt-based SAC.",Journal of Catalysis
Improving stability of MXenes,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Due to their superior hydrophilicity and conductivity, ultra-high volumetric capacitance, and rich surface-chemistry properties, MXenes exhibit unique and excellent performance in catalysis, energy storage, electromagnetic shielding, and life sciences. Since they are derived from ceramics (MAX phase) through etching, one of the challenges in MXenes preparation is the inevitable exposure of metal atoms on their surface and embedding of anions and cations. Because the as-obtained MXenes are always in a thermodynamically metastable state, they tend to react with trace oxygen or oxygen-containing groups to form metal oxides or degrade, leading to sharply declined activity and impaired performance. Therefore, improving the stability of MXenes-based materials is of practical significance in relevant applications. Unfortunately, there lacks a comprehensive review in the literature on relevant topics. To help promote the wide applications of MXenes, we review from the following aspects: (i) insights into the factors affecting the stability of MXenes-based materials, including oxidation of MXenes flakes, stability of MXenes colloidal solutions, and swelling and degradation of MXenes thin-film, (ii) strategies for enhancing the stability of MXenes-based materials by optimizing MAX phase synthesis and modifying the MXenes preparation, and (iii) techniques for further increasing the stability of freshly prepared MXenes-based materials via controlling the storage conditions, and forming shielding on the surface and/or edge of MXenes flakes. Finally, some outlooks are proposed on the future developments and challenges of highly active and stable MXenes. We aim to provide guidance for the design, preparation, and applications of MXenes-based materials with excellent stability and activity. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano Research
Atomic-Scale Design of Anode Materials for Alkali Metal (Li/Na/K)-Ion Batteries: Progress and Perspectives,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Energy Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.The development and optimization of high-performance anode materials for alkali metal ion batteries is crucial for the green energy evolution. Atomic scale computational modeling such as density functional theory and molecular dynamics allows for efficient and adventurous materials design from the nanoscale, and have emerged as invaluable tools. Computational modeling cannot only provide fundamental insight, but also present input for multiscale models and experimental synthesis, often where quantities cannot readily be obtained by other means. In this review, an overview of three main anode classes; alloying, conversion, and intercalation-type anodes, is provided and how atomic scale modeling is used to understand and optimize these materials for applications in lithium-, sodium-, and potassium-ion batteries. In the last part of this review, a novel type of anode materials that are largely predicted from density functional theory simulations is presented. These 2D materials are currently in their early stages of development and are only expected to gain in importance in the years to come, both within the battery field and beyond, highlighting the ability of atomic scale materials design.",Advanced Energy Materials
Catalytic Mechanism of Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Oxides for Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Defective materials have been demonstrated to possess adsorptive and catalytic properties in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, which can effectively solve the problems of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttle and sluggish conversion kinetics during charging and discharging of Li–S batteries. However, there is still a lack of research on the quantitative relationship between the defect concentration and the adsorptive-catalytic performance of the electrode. In this work, perovskites Sr0.9Ti1−xMnxO3−δ (STMnx) (x = 0.1–0.3) with different oxygen-vacancy concentrations are quantitatively regulated as research models. Through a series of tests of the adsorptive property and electrochemical performance, a quantitative relationship between oxygen-vacancy concentration and adsorptive-catalytic properties is established. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism of oxygen vacancies in Li–S batteries is investigated using density functional theory calculations and in situ experiments. The increased oxygen vacancies can effectively increase the binding energy between perovskite and LiPSs, reduce the energy barrier of LiPSs decomposition reaction, and promote LiPSs conversion reaction kinetics. Therefore, the perovskite STMn0.3 with high oxygen-vacancy concentrations exhibits excellent LiPSs adsorptive and catalytic properties, realizing high-efficiency Li–S batteries. This work is helpful to realize the application of the quantitative regulation strategy of defect engineering in Li–S batteries.",Advanced Materials
Molybdenum Carbide Electrocatalyst In Situ Embedded in Porous Nitrogen-Rich Carbon Nanotubes Promotes Rapid Kinetics in Sodium-Metal–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.This is the first report of molybdenum carbide-based electrocatalyst for sulfur-based sodium-metal batteries. MoC/Mo2C is in situ grown on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes in parallel with formation of extensive nanoporosity. Sulfur impregnation (50 wt% S) results in unique triphasic architecture termed molybdenum carbide–porous carbon nanotubes host (MoC/Mo2C@PCNT–S). Quasi-solid-state phase transformation to Na2S is promoted in carbonate electrolyte, with in situ time-resolved Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical analyses demonstrating minimal soluble polysulfides. MoC/Mo2C@PCNT–S cathodes deliver among the most promising rate performance characteristics in the literature, achieving 987 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, 818 mAh g−1 at 3 A g−1, and 621 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1. The cells deliver superior cycling stability, retaining 650 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g−1, corresponding to 0.028% capacity decay per cycle. High mass loading cathodes (64 wt% S, 12.7 mg cm−2) also show cycling stability. Density functional theory demonstrates that formation energy of Na2Sx (1 ≤ x ≤ 4) on surface of MoC/Mo2C is significantly lowered compared to analogous redox in liquid. Strong binding of Na2Sx (1 ≤ x ≤ 4) on MoC/Mo2C surfaces results from charge transfer between the sulfur and Mo sites on carbides’ surface.",Advanced Materials
Advances in the Development of Single-Atom Catalysts for High-Energy-Density Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Although lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are promising next-generation energy-storage systems, their practical applications are limited by the growth of Li dendrites and lithium polysulfide shuttling. These problems can be mitigated through the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs), which exhibit the advantages of maximal atom utilization efficiency (≈100%) and unique catalytic properties, thus effectively enhancing the performance of electrode materials in energy-storage devices. This review systematically summarizes the recent progress in SACs intended for use in Li-metal anodes, S cathodes, and separators, briefly introducing the operating principles of Li–S batteries, the action mechanisms of the corresponding SACs, and the fundamentals of SACs activity, and then comprehensively describes the main strategies for SACs synthesis. Subsequently, the applications of SACs and the principles of SACs operation in reinforced Li–S batteries as well as other metal–S batteries are individually illustrated, and the major challenges of SACs usage in Li–S batteries as well as future development directions are presented.",Advanced Materials
Mechano-thermal milling synthesis of atomically dispersed platinum with spin polarization induced by cobalt atoms towards enhanced oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdTuning the local spin configurations of single-atom electrocatalysts holds enormous promise in boosting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but still fills with challenging of lacking efficient means. Herein, a binary-atom catalyst (PtCo-NC) consisting of atomically dispersed Pt and Co on nitrogen doped carbon is rationally designed and synthesized by a mechano-thermal milling method. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of atomically dispersed Co results in spin polarization of adjacent Pt atoms, which optimizes the absorption energy and lowers the energy barrier of the rate-determining step, thus accelerating oxygen catalyzed reaction kinetics for PtCo-NC. As a consequence, the constructed PtCo-NC possesses an outstanding ORR performance with a positive half-wave potential (0.85 V), large kinetic current density (83.3 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V), low Tafel slope (85 mV dec−1) and robust cyclic stability (more than 90% retention after 170 h in alkaline media). As the cathodic catalyst, the zinc-air battery driven by PtCo-NC delivers the maximum power density (204 mW cm−2), excellent rate capacity and remarkable durability. The present work may provide new insight into boosting oxygen reduction reaction activity, leading the exploration toward highly efficient catalysts for renewable energy storage and conversion systems.",Nano Energy

However, the uncontrollable sulfur speciation pathways severely hinder its practical applications. Recently, various strategies have been employed to tune the conversion pathways of sulfur, such as physical confinement, chemical inhibition, and electrocatalysis. Herein, the recent advances in electrocatalytic effects manipulate sulfur speciation pathways in advanced RT NaS electrochemistry are reviewed, including the promotion of the nearly full conversion of long-chain polysulfides, short-chain polysulfides, and small sulfur molecules. The underlying catalytic modulation mechanism that fundamentally tunes the electrochemical pathway of sulfur species is comprehensively summarized along with the design strategies for catalytic active centers. Furthermore, the challenge and potential solutions to realize the quasi-solid conversion of sulfur are proposed to accelerate the real application of RT NaS batteries.",Small Methods
Regulations of active moiety in single atom catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Hydrogen production from water splitting using renewable electric energy is an interesting topic towards the carbon neutral future. Single atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a new frontier in the field of catalysis such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), owing to their intriguing properties like high activity and excellent chemical selectivity. The catalytic active moiety is often comprised of a single metal atom and its neighboring environment from the supports. Recent published reviews about electricdriven HER tend to classify these SACs by the species of active center atom, nevertheless the influence of their neighboring coordinated atoms from the supports is somehow neglected. Thus we classify the SACs for HER through the type of supports, highlighting the electronic metal-support interaction and their coordination environment from support. Then, we put forward some structural designing strategies including regulating of the central atoms, coordination environments, and metal-support interactions. Finally, the current challenges and future research perspectives of SACs for HER are briefly proposed. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano Research
The continuous efficient conversion and directional deposition of lithium (poly)sulfides enabled by bimetallic site regulation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe shuttle effect caused by the dissolution and accumulation of soluble (poly)sulfides seriously affects the reaction process and cycle performance of the lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery. One of the most effective strategies is the separator modification. The adsorption and catalytic mechanism of separator modification layer will cause discontinuous polysulfide conversion and loss of active substances. Therefore, 2D-bimetallic centered Zn/Co-ZIF nanosheets prepared by a novel method are selected to settle this unsolved problem for the first time. By regulating the metal center sites, the ability of ZIF nanosheets to transform (poly)sulfides is greatly improved.Further, based on the difference in conductivity between the ZIF modification layer and the cathode, the continuous efficient conversion and directional deposition of lithium (poly)sulfides to the cathode are realized. The battery assembled with the functional separator can deliver an initial capacity of up to 1304 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C, and excellent rate performance of 788 mAh g−1 at 3 C. Even at the current density of 2 C, the capacity attenuation rate of 1000 cycles is only 0.025% per cycle. This work will greatly promote the preparation of MOF materials and their application in Li-S batteries, and will further provide a new idea for the modification layer and cathode design.",Nano Energy
Revisiting the corrosion mechanism of LiFSI based electrolytes in lithium metal batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), regarded as one of the most promising alternative of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6), seriously weakens the electrochemical performance of lithium metal batteries at high voltages, due to its extreme corrosion in nonaqueous electrolyte towards some components of the batteries. Though studies have shown that the aluminum (Al) collector will be corroded in LiFSI electrolytes, few attentions have been paid to the corrosion of steel components of lithium metal batteries, the corrosion intensity of which is much more severe than that of Al. Herein, by comparing the electrochemical corrosion behaviors of Al foil and stainless steel (SS) in LiFSI electrolytes, the corrosion products were characterized and analyzed, and the corrosion mechanism of SS was further proposed. Based on the corrosion mechanism, a strategy to inhibit the corrosion by using high concentration electrolyte (HCE) was also proposed. Moreover, introduction of 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl ether into HCE, forming a localized high concentration electrolyte (LHCE), which not only addresses the viscosity and wettability issues of HCE but also inhibits the corrosion in conventional concentration electrolyte. As a result, Li||LiCoO2 coin cells using HCE and LHCE show excellent cycling stability with capacity fading rates of 0.53% and 0.26% per cycle, respectively, at 1 C (1 C = 180 mAh g − 1) between 3 – 4.45 V. The same corrosion inhibition regular also has been proved in pouch cells.",Electrochimica Acta
Flexible MXene films for batteries and beyond,"© 2022 The Authors. Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.MXenes add dozens of metallic conductors to the family of two-dimensional (2D) materials. A top-down synthesis approach removing A-layer atoms (e.g., Al, Si, and Ga) in MAX phases to produce 2D flakes attaches various surface terminations to MXenes. With these terminations, MXenes show tunable properties, promising a range of applications from energy storage devices to electronics, including sensors, transistors, and antennas. MXenes are also excellent building blocks to create flexible films used for flexible and wearable devices. This article summarizes the synthesis of MXene flakes and highlights aspects that need attention for flexible devices. Rather than listing the development of energy storage devices in detail, we focus on the main challenges of and solutions for constructing high-performance devices. Moreover, we show the applications of MXene films in electronics to call on designs to construct a complete system based on MXene with good flexibility, which consists of a power source, sensors, transistors, and wireless communications.",Carbon Energy
Direct Visualization of the Evolution of a Single-Atomic Cobalt Catalyst from Melting Nanoparticles with Carbon Dissolution,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Transition metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) are of immense interest, but how exactly they are evolved upon pyrolysis of the corresponding precursors remains unclear as transition metal ions in the complex precursor undergo a series of morphological changes accompanied with changes in oxidation state as a result of the interactions with the carbon support. Herein, the authors record the complete evolution process of Co SAC during the pyrolysis a Co/Zn-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework. Aberration-corrected environmental TEM coupled with in-situ EELS is used for direct visualization of the evolution process at 200–1000 °C. Dissolution of carbon into the nanoparticles of Co is found to be key to modulating the wetting behavior of nanoparticles on the carbon support; melting of Co nanoparticles and their motion within the zeolitic architecture leads to the etching of the framework structure, yielding porous C/N support onto which Co-single atoms reside. This uniquely structured Co SAC is found to be effective for the oxidation of a series of aromatic alkanes to produce selective ketones among other possible products. The carbon dissolution and melting/sublimation-driven structural dynamics of transition metal revealed here will expand the methodology in synthesizing SACs and other high-temperature processes.",Advanced Science
Degrees of freedom for energy storage material,"© 2022 The Authors. Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Building a bridge between properties and structures has always been the key focus of any materials research. Nowadays, energy storage materials, especially lithium-ion batteries, are crucial both in daily life and for the research community. Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover the functionality origin of battery performances to improve and design better material systems. Functionality originates from local symmetry and field. Local symmetry can be described by four fundamental degrees of freedom: lattice, charge, orbital, and spin. On the basis of this, detailed descriptions of the battery's properties in terms of lattice, charge, orbital, and spin are presented from the perspective of frontier transmission electron microscopy in this review. Besides, frontier in situ methods are introduced to record the dynamic structural evolution process during the battery cycle. Future discussion from the perspectives of both materials and characterizations is provided at the end of this review.",Carbon Energy
The structural and ionic conductivity analysis of poly(ethylene oxide)/LiTFSI/MOF-5 nanocomposite electrolytes by using molecular dynamics simulations,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.In this study, the structure and ionic conductivity behavior of a polymer nanocomposite electrolyte system consisting of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), metal–organic framework 5 (MOF-5), and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) were investigated by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Based on ionic conductivity data from MD simulations, the mobility of Li cations increases in PEO:LiTFSI electrolyte system with the addition of MOF-5. Zn atoms of MOF-5 hold almost three TFSI anions per Zn atom. In addition, when Zn atoms of MOFs and oxygen atoms of PEO interact, four oxygen atoms are saturated per Zn atom. Furthermore, Li cations are stuck among oxygen atoms of PEO as a result of their ionic interactions with O atoms. Positive charges of MOF-5 leads to the separation of Li cations from TFSI anions in PEO:LiTFSI:MOF-5 electrolyte system. In addition, positively charged atoms of MOF-5 interact with oxygen atoms of PEO chains. MOF-5 exhibits acidic surface properties through Zn atoms located close to its surface, and Zn atoms interact with partially negatively charged oxygen atoms of PEO chains and fully negatively charged TFSI anions. Therefore, lithium cations are released. The mobility of Li cations increases due to favorable interactions of MOF-5 with PEO and TFSI anions. The ionic conductivity results verify that nanoparticles like MOF-5 consisting of positively charged atoms can be used to improve the ionic mobility in electrolyte systems which include PEO-like polymers consisting of partially negative charged atoms.",Ionics
Ultrafast Crystallization of Ordered Mesoporous Metal Oxides and Carbon from Block Copolymer Self-Assembly and Joule Heating,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Conventional heat treatments to generate well-ordered and crystalline mesoporous oxide and carbon structures are limited by long durations and annealing temperatures that can cause mesostructural collapse. This paper describes a facile strategy coupling block copolymer-directed self-assembly with high-power Joule heating to form highly crystalline and well-ordered mesoporous oxide and carbon nanostructures within second timeframes. The combined approach is compatible with various functional self-assembled hybrid systems with a range of crystallization temperatures, generating mesoporous composites of γ-Al2O3-carbon, γ-Al2O3/MgO-carbon, and anatase-TiO2-carbon with p6mm symmetry, non-close-packed mesoporous carbon, as well as hierarchical mesoporous α-Fe2O3-carbon structures. Removing the polymer/carbon gives well-defined, highly crystalline mesoporous all-γ-Al2O3 and all-anatase-TiO2 structures. Impregnation of chloroplatinic acid followed by Joule heating yields platinum nanoparticles decorated on the channel walls of mesoporous γ-Al2O3-carbon structures. The resultant Joule-heating-induced well-ordered crystalline mesoporous oxide and oxide-carbon structures have high thermal and structural stabilities and exhibit better performances in CO2 adsorption capacity and lithium-ion batteries than conventional heat-treated counterparts. This approach represents an energy-efficient and time-saving route toward ordered porous materials with high surface area and pore accessibility for a wide range of environmental applications such as carbon sequestration, renewable energy storage, and environmental filtration.",Advanced Materials Interfaces
Constructing a stable cobalt-nitrogen-carbon air cathode from coordinatively unsaturated zeolitic-imidazole frameworks for rechargeable zinc-air batteries,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Zeolitic-imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) derivations have widely emerged as an efficient air cathode of zinc-air batteries (ZABs) due to excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis performance. However, they are not stable enough for long-term operation of rechargeable ZABs because of weak association with current collector, especially under bending conditions for flexible ZAB devices. Here, we show that by purposely designing coordinatively unsaturated ZIFs via a facile morphology regulation, which can be chemically linked on acid-treated carbon cloth, a stable Co-N-C air cathode is therefore derived where Co nanoparticles (NPs) are uniformly confined within the Co-N-C matrix on carbon cloth (Co/Co-N-C/CC). Specifically, when without being stabilized from carbon cloth, the pyrolysis of ZIFs with different unsaturated coordination levels has a negligible impact on the bifunctional oxygen-catalyzed performance. The optimal Co/Co-N-C/CC catalyst assembled ZAB possesses a large open circuit voltage of 1.415 V and a high peak power density of 163 mW·cm−2 as well as excellent cycling durability upon 630 discharge-charge cycles with 61% voltage efficiency remained, largely exceeding those of a benchmark Pt/C-IrO2 catalyst assembled ZAB. The synergy between Co NPs and active Co-N-C sites via electronic interaction induces the outstanding bifunctional oxygen-catalyzed activity and cathode performance. The present work highlights the importance of unsaturated coordination structures in ZIFs precursors for the performance of derived nanostructures in integrated electrodes.

Large-scale doping-engineering enables boron/nitrogen dual-doped porous carbon for high-performance zinc ion capacitors,"© 2022, Youke Publishing Co.,Ltd.Abstract: Zinc ion capacitors (ZICs) have drawn increasing interest in energy storage devices because of their economic benefits, high safety, and long cycling life. Nevertheless, the lack of high-performance cathodes for ZICs remains a key challenge. Here, we fabricated B, N co-doped porous carbon (BN-C) via a salt template strategy. The aqueous ZICs assembled from BN-C cathode delivered a high capacity of 190.2 mAh·g−1 and a remarkable energy density of 105.1 Wh·kg−1. Moreover, systematic characterization verifies that B/N dual-doping promotes the physical adsorption/desorption kinetics of anion and the chemical absorption/desorption kinetics of Zn2+, thus improving the electrochemical performance of ZICs. In addition, the quasi-solid-state pouch-type battery exhibited excellent electrochemical durability and mechanical flexibility, demonstrating its vast application potential as a flexible power source. Overall, this research not only presents a reasonable approach to the large-scale production of carbon cathode materials with excellent electrochemical performance but also strengthens the essential recognition of the charge storage mechanism of heteroatoms-doped carbon materials.

Non-doping 3D porous carbon with rich intrinsic defects for efficient nonradical activation of peroxymonosulfate toward the degradation of organic pollutants,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation is regarded as a powerful method for the degradation of organic pollutants. Carbon materials have attracted much attention for PMS activation toward efficient nonradical oxidation process. The catalytic activity of most nanocarbon materials is usually attributed to heteroatom doping, while the contribution of intrinsic defects has been explored little. Herein, self-template method was used to synthesize porous carbon with rich intrinsic defects. The results showed that the intrinsic defects enhanced adsorption and activation of PMS. FT-IR and DFT results revealed the adsorption of PMS on the vacancy defect resulted in the elongation of the peroxy bonds, producing a higher potential of surface-bound oxidative complexes (3DPC-X-PMS*). Electron transfer from pollutants to PMS* was achieved and phenol was degraded with a kinetic constant of 1.45 min−1, higher than most reported carbon-based materials. Other pollutants including bisphenol A, sulfamethoxazole and 4-chlorophenol also can be degraded efficiently. Furthermore, it can keep original catalytic activity in complicated water matrix. The work provides a strategy to develop efficient carbon materials and contributes to the better understanding of the role of intrinsic defects for PMS activation in the degradation of organic pollutants.",Separation and Purification Technology
Generation of nanomaterials by reactive laser-synthesis in liquid,"© 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Nanomaterials with tailored structures and surface chemistry are in high demand, as these materials play increasingly important roles in biology, catalysis, energy storage, and manufacturing. Their heightened demand has attracted attention towards the development of synthesis routes, particularly, laser-synthesis techniques. These efforts drove the refinement of laser ablation in liquid (LAL) and related methods over the past two decades and have led to the emergence of reactive laser-synthesis techniques that exploit these methods’ characteristic, non-equilibrium conditions. Reactive laser-synthesis approaches foster unique chemical reactions that enable the formation of composite products like multimetallic nanoparticles, supported nanostructures, and complex minerals. This review will examine emerging reactive laser-synthesis methods in the context of established methods like LAL. The focus will be on the chemical reactions initiated within the laser plasma, with the goal of understanding how these reactions lead to the formation of unique nanomaterials. We will provide the first systematic review of laser reaction in liquid (LRL) in the literature, and bring a focus to the chemical reaction mechanisms in LAL and reactive-LAL techniques that have not yet been emphasized in reviews. Discussion of the current challenges and future investigative opportunities into reactive laser-synthesis will impart guidance for researchers interested in designing reactive laser-synthesis approaches to novel nanomaterial production.","Science China: Physics, Mechanics and Astronomy"
Single-atom iron catalysts for biomedical applications,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd(Fe)-based single-atom catalysts (SACs), featuring atomically dispersed Fe atom active centers, display superior catalytic activity and selectivity.

Modulating the d-band centers by coordination environment regulation of single-atom Ni on porous carbon fibers for overall water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe coordination environment of metal atoms is at the center of designing high-performance single-atom catalysts (SACs), which deserves to provide appropriate metal–support interaction. Herein, we propose a coordination environment regulation strategy to modulate the d-band center of Ni by introducing different heteroatoms, such as N, N-B, N-P, N-S, into porous carbon nanofibers (CNFs), which enables to optimize the geometrical and electronic structures of isolated Ni atoms, thus tunes the interaction between Ni center and intermediates for effective water splitting. The experimental and theoretical results indicate the d-band center of Ni atoms coupled with three N atoms and one P atom is tailored to moderate position to create favorable binding with H/O-containing intermediates, thus leading to benefitting thermodynamics and kinetics for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution. As a proof, the designed Ni-N,P/CNFs with Ni-N3-P moiety shows extraordinary overall water splitting ability, superior to other coordination configurations. Notably, the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction upon Ni-N,P/CNFs present ultralow overpotential of 38 mV to afford 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slope of 24 mV dec−1, placed at the top of reported single-atom-based catalysts. Such concept of modulating d-band center could provide in-depth insight into the design and performance optimization of SACs.",Nano Energy
Scalable Lithiophilic/Sodiophilic Porous Buffer Layer Fabrication Enables Uniform Nucleation and Growth for Lithium/Sodium Metal Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Metallic lithium/sodium (Li/Na) is considered an attractive anode for future high-energy-density batteries. The root causes of preventing their applications come from uneven Li/Na nucleation and subsequent dendrite formation. Here, a cost-efficient and scalable solid-to-solid transfer method for dense buffer layer construction on Li/Na anodes is proposed, and thin lithiophilic/sodiophilic buffer layers based on natural silk fibers derived carbon (SFC) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composites (denoted as SFC/CNTs) are adopted, which facilitate uniform Li/Na nucleation and dendrite-free, lateral growth behavior upon recurring Li/Na plating/stripping processes. Lithiopilic/sodiophilic buffer layers enable long-term cycling stability (>250 cycles) with high Coulombic efficiency (99.2% for Li and 98.8% for Na), low polarization, and flat voltage profiles. More importantly, the cycling performance of LiFePO4|Li pouch cells is largely enhanced with a lifespan of 390 cycles. Further, using ultra-thin Li anodes (25 μm) also achieves stable LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2|Li cells with 200 cycles under a low negative/positive ratio (1.67). Similar achievement is also realized in Na-metal batteries with negligible capacity fading for over 600 cycles in Na3V2(PO4)3|Na cells, further demonstrating that SFC/CNT buffer layer is technically viable in practical batteries. This study provides a facile strategy for fabricating dense and uniform lithiophilic/sodiophilic buffer layers for low-cost and scale-up energy storage devices.",Advanced Functional Materials
Reducing Valence States of Co Active Sites in a Single-Atom Nanozyme for Boosted Tumor Therapy,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.The construction of biocompatible and trackable-imaging single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with efficient catalytic activities is particularly desirable. Here, cobalt/titanium oxide (Co/TiO2) SAzymes are presented with cobalt atomically dispersed on nanoporous hollow TiO2 using a cation-exchange strategy. Significantly, by varying the calcination conditions, the enzyme-like activity can be enhanced tenfold. It is determined that different calcination treatments result in valence state shifts of the Co active site due to changes in the amounts of defects, which affects the catalytic kinetics. Moreover, Co/TiO2 SAzymes exhibit good intrinsic biocompatibility and excellent tolerance toward the biological medium, while the hollow structure facilitates the loading of drugs and imaging agents for image-guided chemo-chemodynamic therapy via intravenous injection. This study not only provides a paradigm shift for the preparation of biocompatible SAzymes but also presents new insights for modulating the catalytic activity of SAzymes.",Advanced Functional Materials
Modulation of Mo–Fe–C Sites Over Mesoscale Diffusion-Enhanced Hollow Sub-Micro Reactors Toward Boosted Electrochemical Water Oxidation,"© 2022 The Authors.

Herein, it is reported that the simultaneous modulation of the mesoscale diffusion and Mo–Fe–C sites formation over monodispersed hollow Fe@MoS2–C sub-micro reactors for boosted OER performance. According to finite element simulation and analysis, the hollow nanostructured MoS2–C host possesses better mesoscale diffusion properties than its solid and yolk–shell counterparts. Notably, the sulfur vacancies and intercalated carbon in the sub-micro reactor offer a unique microenvironment for Fe anchoring on Mo–Fe–C sites. The stability and activity of the sites are revealed by theoretical calculations. The resultant Fe@MoS2-C presents an OER overpotential of 194 mV, which is much better than those of the Fe-based single-atom catalysts reported in the data.

A novel hybrid material composed of 1D carbon nanofibers (CNF) and 2D graphene micro-ribbons (GMR) was synthesized and incorporated as anodes in Li-ion batteries (LIB) and Potassium-ion batteries (KIB) for improved storage capacity. CNF-GMR material was hybridized simultaneously by one-step chemical vapour deposition (CVD) synthetic process, wherein the CNF were grown on the graphene surface using an iron oxide catalyst. Meanwhile, the GMRs were formed by the catalytic cutting of few-layer graphene. This unique carbon‑carbon allotropic hybrid exhibits excellent structural integrity, good electrical conductivity (718 S/m) and high specific surface area (305.6 g/m2). The as-prepared materials, when used as an anode in batteries, exhibited a highly reversible capacity (598 mAhg−1 and 410 mAhg−1 at 0.10 Ag−1 for LIB and KIB, respectively) with fast charging and discharging capability, and long-term cycling stability with 99% Coulombic efficiency over 1000 cycles.",Sustainable Materials and Technologies
Hollow Core-Shell Particle-Containing Coating for Passive Daytime Radiative Cooling,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdPassive daytime radiative cooling has received raising attention as a promising strategy for thermal management. Among various radiative cooling coatings, the particles-containing coating has a more practical application prospect because it can be produced on a large scale. Works on the investigation of the particle structure are still lack. Herein, hollow SiO2@TiO2 core–shell particles (HCSP) and HCSP-containing silicone radiative cooling coating (RCC) were prepared. With stronger backscattering of HCSP, RCC reflected incident sunlight and emitted mid-infrared light efficiently, compared to the commercial white paint and hollow spheres coating, having the maximum Rsolar of 0.97 and maximum εATW of 0.95. It exhibited favorable cooling properties with a temperature drop of 5.26 °C illuminated under solar simulator and an average temperature drop of 6.9 °C simulated with COMSOL.

Regulating symmetry of organic precursors for mechanochemical synthesizing rich pyridonic-/pyridinic-nitrogen doped graphyne,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdGraphyne, a promising carbon candidate for energy storage and conversion, has been prepared successfully via a mechanochemical route. However, inevitable graphitic carbon species generate concomitantly. In this work, we synthesize rich pyridonic-/pyridinic-nitrogen doped graphyne (NGY) employing calcium carbide and asymmetric pentachloropyridine (PCP) as precursors and find that introducing symmetric hexabromobenzene (HBB) can suppress the formation of graphitic carbon impurities. The symmetry of organic precursors is a key to the yield of NGY during the mechanochemical process, so a competitive formation mechanism between NGY and graphitic carbon species is proposed according to experimental results and theoretical calculation. Compared with the samples obtained from single asymmetric PCP or symmetric HBB, an optimized NGY (1:1 molar ratio of PCP/HBB) increases the Li-storage capacity by 11% and 52% respectively, owing to abundant Li+ adsorption and high structural stability. This work highlights organic precursor symmetry for undergoing mechanochemical cross-coupling and brings new insights to in-situ constructing heteroatom-doped alkynyl carbon frameworks.",Carbon

The samples were formed via the sol-gel spin coating deposition process and calcined at varying temperatures to produce Nb2O5 thin films. The fabricated thin films were then subjected to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and electrical tests. The XRD showed the films to have an orthorhombic structure, while the EDX indicated the presence of niobium oxide in the thin films. The SEM analysis revealed that the films consisted of nanometric spheres, with the FTIR spectroscopy illustrating the formation of an Nb-O-Nb bond. Also, the thin films showed a high absorbance coefficient in the UV region, with 3.61 eV as the lowest optical energy bandgap at 700 °C. The conductivity and resistivity tests confirmed that the synthesized thin films were good semiconductors. The correlation between the different analyses with respect to the annealing temperatures of the Nb2O5 thin films was also discussed.",Polyhedron
Dual-ligand and hard-soft-acid-base strategies to optimize metal-organic framework nanocrystals for stable electrochemical cycling performance,"© 2022 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.Most metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) hardly maintain their physical and chemical properties after exposure to acidic, neutral, or alkaline aqueous solutions, resulting in insufficient stability, therefore limiting their applications. Thus, the design and synthesis of stable size/morphology-controlled MOF nanocrystals is critical but challenging. In this study, dual-ligand and hard-soft-acid-base strategies were used to fabricate a variety of 3D pillared-layer [Ni(thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate)(4,4′-bipyridine)]n MOF nanocrystals (1D nanofibers, 2D nanosheets and 3D aggregates) with controllable morphology by varying the concentration of 4,4′-bipyridine and thus controlling the crystal growth direction. Owing to the shorter ion diffusion length, enhanced electron/ion transfer and strong interactions between thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate and 4,4′-bipyridine, the 2D nanosheets showed much larger specific capacitance than 1D nanofibers and 3D aggregates. A single device with an output voltage as high as 3.0 V and exceptional cycling performance (95% of retention after 5000 cycles at 3 mA cm-2) was realized by configuring two aqueous asymmetric supercapacitive devices in series. The excellent cycling property and charge-discharge mechanism are consistent with the hard-soft-acid-base theory.",National Science Review
Kinetically accelerated and high-mass loaded lithium storage enabled by atomic iron embedded carbon nanofibers,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Carbonaceous materials represent the dominant choice of materials for anodic lithium storage in many energy storage devices. Nevertheless, the nonpolar carbonaceous materials offer weak adsorption toward Li+ that largely denies the high-rate Li+ storage. Herein, the atomic Fe sites decorated carbon nanofibers (AICNFs) facilely produced by electrospinning are reported for kinetically accelerated Li+ storage. Theoretical calculation reveals that the atomic Fe sites possess coordination unsaturated electronic configuration, enabling suitable bonding energy and facilitated diffusion path of Li+. As a result, the optimal structure displays a high capacitive contribution up to 95.9% at a scan rate of 2.0 mV·s−1. In addition, ultrahigh capacity retention of 97% is afforded after 5,000 cycles at a current density of 3 A·g−1. Moreover, the interlaced fiber structure enabled by electrospinning benefits structural stability and improved conductivity even at thick electrodes, thus allowing a high areal capacity of 1.76 mAh·cm−2 at a loading of 8 mg·cm−2. Because of these structure and performance merits, the lithium-ion capacitor containing the AICNF-based anode delivers a high energy density and large power density.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano Research

To achieve better conductivity, MOF-76(Gd) was carbonized and applied as a conductive nest in the sulphur cathode. Activated (AC) and carbonized (C) MOF-76(Gd) in electrode material displayed sulphur encapsulation and polysulphide confinement which was proved by stable capacity during cycling.

Cooperatively interface role of surface atoms and aqueous media on single atom catalytic property for H2O2 synthesis,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Direct electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from H2 and O2 is a promising alternative to currently industrial Riedl-Pfleiderer route. Utilizing a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and ab-initio-molecular dynamic simulation (AIMD), we presented an effective computational framework to identify the cooperative role of surface atoms(e.g. O, N and S) and aqueous media on catalytic performance of single-atom catalysts (SACs) supported Nb2C MXenes. Computational results shown that both Ni/Nb2CN2 and Co/Nb2CS2 have low overpotentials of 0.17 V and 0.20 V, and the barrier of 0.89 eV and 0.67 eV for 2e- ORR under gas phase, respectively, while in aqueous phase, hydrogen bond framework on the surface promotes the transfer of proton, resulting in the lower 2e- ORR overpotential (0.05 V) in Co/Nb2CS2 and lower barrier (almost 0.01 eV) for rate-determining step (RDS) in Ni/Nb2CN2. Electronically, we found that the less-electronegativity N and S relative to O more benefit to mediate the activation degree of O2 on SACs and thereby improve catalytic selectivity. Thus, it is concluded that both surface atom and aqueous medium synergistically promote catalytic property for H2O2 synthesis.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Comprehensive review on zinc-ion battery anode: Challenges and strategies,"© 2022 The Authors. InfoMat published by UESTC and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have been extensively investigated and discussed as promising energy storage devices in recent years owing to their low cost, high energy density, inherent safety, and low environmental impact. Nevertheless, several challenges remain that need to be prioritized before realizing the widespread application of ZIBs. In particular, the development of zinc anodes has been hindered by many challenges, such as inevitable zinc dendrites, corrosion passivation, and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which have severely limited the practical application of high-performance ZIBs. This review starts with a systematic discussion of the origins of zinc dendrites, corrosion passivation, and the HER, as well as their effects on battery performance. Subsequently, we discuss solutions to the above problems to protect the zinc anode, including the improvement of zinc anode materials, modification of the anode–electrolyte interface, and optimization of the electrolyte. In particular, this review emphasizes design strategies to protect zinc anodes from an integrated perspective with broad interest rather than a view with limited focus. In the final section, comments and perspectives are provided for the future design of high-performance zinc anodes. (Figure presented.).",InfoMat
Quench-tailored Al-doped V2O5 nanomaterials for efficient aqueous zinc-ion batteries,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesRechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are regarded as a promising competition to lithium-ion batteries as energy storage devices, owing to their high safety and low cost. However, the development of high-performance ZIBs is largely hindered by the shortage of ideal cathode materials with high-rate capability and long-cycle stability. Herein, we address this bottleneck issue by the quenching-tailored surface chemistry of V2O5 cathode nanomaterial. By rapid quenching from high temperatures, Al ions are doped into V2O5 lattice (Al-V2O5) and abundant oxygen vacancies are formed on the surface/near-surface, which facilitate the desired rapid electron transfers. Our density functional theory (DFT) simulations elucidate that the doping of Al ions into V2O5 remarkably reduces the Zn2+-diffusion barriers and improves the electrical conductivity of V2O5. As a proof-of-concept application, the thus-optimized Al-V2O5 cathode delivers a superior specific capacity of 532 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and a long-cycling life with 76% capacity retention after 5000 cycles, as well as a good rate performance. This work provides not only a novel strategy for tuning the surface chemistry of V2O5 to boost the Zn2+ storage but also a general pathway of modifying metal oxides with improved electrochemical performance.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Atomically dispersed antimony on N-doped carbon for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022Main-group metal based single-atom catalysts are attracting increasing research attention in electrochemical catalysis owing to their partially occupied valence p-orbitals. Herein, we report a series of atomically dispersed Sb-N-C catalysts (including Sb-N-CNP, Sb-N-CNL and Sb-N-CNT) synthesized by a facile adsorption-pyrolysis strategy for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Apart from generating atomically dispersed Sb-N5 sites as active centers, self-evaporation of Sb during pyrolysis process has created abundant micro/meso-pores in Sb-N-C catalysts. Benefitting from these advantageous features, Sb-N-C presents outstanding ORR activity (Sb-N5 sites) and efficient mass transport (micro/meso-pores). By rotating disk electrode (RDE) test in alkaline media, Sb-N-C exhibits a most positive half-wave potential of 0.90 V vs. RHE and a highest kinetic current density up to 43.8 mA cm−2 at 0.85 V vs. RHE. As gas diffusion electrode (GDE), Sb-N-CNP0.2 demonstrates fast O2 diffusion and transport that enables smaller mass transport overpotential at high current densities up to 800 mA cm−2. Finally, Zn-air battery that uses the Sb-N-CNP catalyst as air electrode achieves a maximum power density of 180 mW cm−2 and more than 1000 hs of continuous operation. This work further demonstrates the excellent performance of main-group Sb single-atom catalyst toward ORR and applications in practical energy conversion devices.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Synergistic Adsorption-Electrocatalysis of 2D/2D heterostructure toward high performance Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The shuttle effect of polysulfides and sluggish reaction kinetics have become current major obstacles for the development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, a novel 2D/2D heterostructure, consisting of ultrathin Ni-Co MOFs with rich unsaturated metal sites and conductive Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (Ti3C2Tx/Ni-Co MOF), is developed as a multifunctional barrier coated on commercial separators for Li-S batteries. Based on the synergistic adsorption-electrocatalysis, the modified separators not only suppress the dissolution of polysulfides and promote their conversion effectively, but also accelerate the electron/ion transfer. Moreover, density functional theory results further confirm that the heterostructure has strong adsorption energy for polysulfides and low energy barriers for their conversion. Li-S batteries with the Ti3C2Tx/Ni-Co MOF heterostructure modified separators exhibit an excellent reversible capacity of 1260 mAh g−1 at 0.2C and a remarkable cycling stability with capacity retention of 91.1 % at 0.5C after 350 cycles. When equipped with high sulfur loading of 5.8 mg cm−2 and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 4 uL mg−1, the cell maintains a superior capacity. This work provides a new route to the design of modified separators for high performance Li-S batteries with especially remarkable cycling stability.",Chemical Engineering Journal
An organosulfide-based energetic liquid as the catholyte in high-energy density lithium metal batteries for large-scale grid energy storage,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Development of catholytes with long-cycle lifespan, high interfacial stability, and fast electrochemical kinetics is crucial for the comprehensive deployment of high-energy density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with cost-efficiency. In this study, a lithiated 2-mercaptopyridine (2-MP-Li) organosulfide was synthesized and used as the soluble catholyte for the first time. Under the routine working mode, the LMB using this 2-MP-Li catholyte possessed high capacity retention of 55.4% with a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of near 100% after 2,000 cycles. When a cell system was fully filled with 2-MP-Li catholyte, it yielded a double capacity with 15% improvement in the capacity retention, corresponding to 0.0182% capacity decay per cycle, as well as excellent rate performance even at 6 mA·cm−2. These superior achievements resulted from the enhanced interfacial stability of Li anode induced by the salt-type 2-MP-Li molecule and the avoiding of using neutral catholyte as the initial active material, thereby mitigating the side reactions originating from the polysulfide shuttle effect. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and kinetics investigations proved the pseudocapacitive characteristic and faster ion diffusion coefficient with this design. Besides, the fabricated energy storage device showed excellent performance but with low economic cost and easy processing. Such a LMB with an alterable amount of capacity has a high potential to be applied in flow-cell type batteries for large-scale grid energy storage in the future.

The final nanocomposite polymer/OCT exhibits antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis). The new nanocomposite material has also been shown to support the growth of B14 cell culture on the substrate and to form cell multilayers, which could lead to the formation of spheroids. This behaviour strongly depends on the concentration of OCT grafted onto the polymer surfaces. This new nanocomposite could be used in medicine, for bioapplications, environmental protection.",Surface and Interface Analysis

Herein, we decorate a 3D porous Ni foam with nitrogen, sulfur-codoped carbon (NSC@Ni) through an interfacial polymerization strategy. It can be demonstrated that the synergetic effect of N and S co-doping can significantly improve the lithiophilicity of both pyrrolic and pyridinic N (in N, S-codoped carbon) according to density functional theoretical calculations. Benefitting from the lithiophilic heteroatom doping, the 3D NSC@Ni skeleton can realize a flat and dendrite-free Li deposition. As a result, the NSC@Ni electrode displays a high Coulombic efficiency of ≈98.59% at 2 mA cm−2 with 4 mA h cm−2 for over 153 cycles. And a stable cycle for 780 h at 1 mA cm−2 with 1 mA h cm−2 in NSC@Ni-Li symmetric cell can be realized.

InfoMat published by UESTC and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Vertical graphene (VG), possessing superior chemical, physical, and structural peculiarities, holds great promise as a building block for constructing a high-energy density lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a new VG growth technique with a novel structure to enable wide applications. Herein, we devise a novel complex permittivity-dependent plasma confinement-assisted VG growth technique, via asymmetric growing a VG layer on one side of N-doped carbon nanofibers for the first time, using a unique lab-built high flux plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition system, as a bifunctional nanofiber membrane to construct Li-S batteries with low negative/positive (N/P) and electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios. The unique nanofiber membrane could simultaneously protect the cathode and anode, enabling an excellent electrochemical performance with low N/P and E/S ratios in Li-S batteries. Such a full cell delivers high gravimetric energy density and volumetric energy density of 340 Wh kg−1 and 547 Wh L−1, respectively, at low N/P (2:1) and E/S (4:1) ratios. Furthermore, a pouch cell achieves a high areal capacity of 7.1 mAh cm−2 at a sulfur loading of 6 mg cm−2. This work put forward a novel pathway for the design of high-energy density Li-S batteries.

Sulfur infiltration and allotrope formation in porous cathode hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. AIChE Journal published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Institute of Chemical Engineers.We investigate sulfur infiltration and formation of lower order allotropes in heated porous hosts during fabrication of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery cathodes. Sulfur existence in cathode ultramicropores has been an important question for Li-S batteries, as ultramicropores reduce the polysulfides “shuttle effect” but also delay sulfur dissolution and Li+ ion diffusion in the trapped solid sulfur. A novel continuum-level model is presented including heat transfer and sulfur infiltration, either from the top of a porous host or from the porous host particle surface, and taking into account the pore size distribution. A novel decay factor in modeling sulfur infiltration incorporates the pore wall repulsion energy and allotrope formation energy (predicted by density functional theory [DFT] simulations). Simulations are performed for a microporous carbon fabric host and an activated carbon powder host with bimodal micropore and macropore size distribution, with Raman and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) spectroscopy confirming the predicted existence of linear S6 and S4 in ultramicropores.",AIChE Journal

For practical applications, it is a challenge to achieve the self-assembly of electrocatalyst from microscopic to macroscopic scales. Herein, a facile strategy is proposed to fabricate a self-supporting electrocatalyst film (CNT-g-PSSCo/PW12) for HER by electrostatic interaction-induced self-assembly of cobalt polystyrene sulfonate-grafted carbon nanotube heterogeneous bottlebrush (CNT-g-PSSCo) and polyoxometalate (PW12). Co2+ ions of CNT-g-PSSCo can function as junctions for interconnecting neighboring bottlebrushes to form the 3D nanonetwork structure and enable electrostatic capture of negatively charged PW12 nanodots. Moreover, CNT backbones can provide highly conductive pathways to CNT-g-PSSCo/PW12. Such a self-assembled CNT-g-PSSCo/PW12 displays a low overpotential of 31 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 25 mV dec−1, showing high efficiency toward HER. Furthermore, CNT-g-PSSCo/PW12 with a stable self-supporting film morphology exhibits long-term electrocatalytic stability over 1000 CV cycles without noticeable overpotential change in acidic media.

Electrochemical Kinetic Modulators in Lithium–Sulfur Batteries: From Defect-Rich Catalysts to Single Atomic Catalysts,"© 2021 Zhengzhou University.Lithium–sulfur batteries exhibit unparalleled merits in theoretical energy density (2600 W h kg−1) among next-generation storage systems. However, the sluggish electrochemical kinetics of sulfur reduction reactions, sulfide oxidation reactions in the sulfur cathode, and the lithium dendrite growth resulted from uncontrollable lithium behaviors in lithium anode have inhibited high-rate conversions and uniform deposition to achieve high performances. Thanks to the “adsorption-catalysis” synergetic effects, the reaction kinetics of sulfur reduction reactions/sulfide oxidation reactions composed of the delithiation of Li2S and the interconversions of sulfur species are propelled by lowering the delithiation/diffusion energy barriers, inhibiting polysulfide shuttling. Meanwhile, the anodic plating kinetic behaviors modulated by the catalysts tend to uniformize without dendrite growth. In this review, the various active catalysts in modulating lithium behaviors are summarized, especially for the defect-rich catalysts and single atomic catalysts. The working mechanisms of these highly active catalysts revealed from theoretical simulation to in situ/operando characterizations are also highlighted. Furthermore, the opportunities of future higher performance enhancement to realize practical applications of lithium–sulfur batteries are prospected, shedding light on the future practical development.",Energy and Environmental Materials

In situ FTIR, ex situ XPS and DFT calculations indicate that the N atoms in aromatic rings and methylene C react with Li+ to form N-Li and C-Li bonds, realizing a specific capacity of 846.6 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 with super lithiation in Li0.5(C/N).

The excellent lithium storage performance could be attributed to the ionic skeleton allowing fast Li+ diffusion, abundant micropores facilitating the filtration of liquid electrolyte, and large cross-linking system with strong endurance to the volume variation of Li+ insertion. Polymerized ionic liquids give a new route to provide traditional electrodes with a high Li+ diffusion coefficient.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

In addition to various noble metals, transition metals have been used in the cores and shells of nanostructures featuring heteroatoms. Such materials are inexpensive and exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability. Likewise, heteroatom-doped nanomaterial and core-shell nanostructure (HCSN) based electrocatalysts serve as bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as the ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These bifunctional electrodes are highly suitable for fuel cell and battery applications. In this review article, we exclusively focus on the important role of HCSNs in various types of fuel cells and batteries. In particular, we discuss the important roles and applications of HCSNs in proton exchange membranes (PEMs), anion exchange membranes (AEMs), direct methanol, microbial, and other types of fuel cells as well as metal ion batteries such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K)-ion batteries. The applications of HCSNs in Li-sulfur (S) batteries and metal-air batteries, such as Li, zinc (Zn), and Na-air batteries, have also been addressed. Finally, we have discussed the technical advancements related to the applications of HCSNs in fuel cells and batteries along with their disadvantages, scope, and future prospects. This review will benefit researchers working in the ECS field as well as those investigating various other applications, such as drug delivery, sensors, and adsorption.",Materials Advances
"Structure, Diffusion, and Stability of Lithium Salts in Aprotic Dimethyl Sulfoxide and Acetonitrile Electrolytes","© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The development of lithium batteries, including lithium-ion batteries and lithium-air batteries, is the key technological breakthrough in the field of renewable energy storage. However, to date, it is still challenging to design a lithium battery with both high specific power and stability. Specifically, the solvation structure and thermodynamic stability of various electrolytes, mostly Li salts and aprotic solvents, have not been systematically studied from an atomic viewpoint. In this paper, we studied the solution chemistry of three most common inorganic Li salts (LiClO4, LiBF4, and LiPF6) and O2in two aprotic (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and acetonitrile (CH3CN)) solvents. The Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced free energy samplings are employed to obtain their solvation structures, diffusion coefficients, and stability performances at room temperature. As a result, the tetrahedral Li(DMSO)4+and Li(CH3CN)4+are obtained as the stable solvation shells of Li+in DMSO and CH3CN solvents, respectively. Among the three inorganic Li salts, the stability performances are found in the order of LiClO4> LiBF4> LiPF6in both DMSO and CH3CN solvents. Compared with CH3CN, DMSO provides a more stable environment for the long-term usage of Li salts for that increases the energetic barriers of the degradation reactions of solvated Li+components. However, DMSO shows a weaker ability (than CH3CN) to transport the main redox species (solvated Li+and O2) in the electrolyte, which limits the discharging and charging rate in the batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Facile and continuous synthesis of graphene nanoflakes in RF thermal plasma,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe aim of this work was to test the oxygen-containing organic compounds as prospective precursors of graphene flakes in a radiofrequency thermal plasma jet. The research covered the plasma processing of nine compounds, including alcohols, carboxylic acids, etc. Herein, the influence of the operating parameters, namely pressure, applied power, precursor feeding rate, and addition of hydrogen, on the efficiency of the product formation rate and yield was thoroughly studied. The morphology of the obtained materials was investigated by electron microscopy. The graphitization was evaluated via Raman spectroscopy. The thermal stability of products was studied utilizing thermogravimetry. Finally, the chemical composition was determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Five compounds (ethanol, butyric acid, propionic acid, acetic anhydride, acetaldehyde) were found to be suitable precursors for continuous synthesis of graphene flakes, while ethyl acetate gave the mixture of graphene flakes and quasi-spherical byproduct. The plasma processing of methanol, formic acid, and acetic acid did not form any solid product.",Carbon
Metalated covalent organic frameworks: from synthetic strategies to diverse applications,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of organic crystalline porous materials discovered in the early 21st century that have become an attractive class of emerging materials due to their high crystallinity, intrinsic porosity, structural regularity, diverse functionality, design flexibility, and outstanding stability. However, many chemical and physical properties strongly depend on the presence of metal ions in materials for advanced applications, but metal-free COFs do not have these properties and are therefore excluded from such applications. Metalated COFs formed by combining COFs with metal ions, while retaining the advantages of COFs, have additional intriguing properties and applications, and have attracted considerable attention over the past decade. This review presents all aspects of metalated COFs, from synthetic strategies to various applications, in the hope of promoting the continued development of this young field.",Chemical Society Reviews
Expanding the ReS2Interlayer Promises High-Performance Potassium-Ion Storage,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Improving the electrochemical kinetics and the intrinsic poor conductivity of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) electrodes is meaningful for developing next-generation energy storage systems. As one of the most promising TMD anode materials, ReS2shows attractive performance in potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). To overcome the poor kinetic ion diffusion and limited cycling stability of the ReS2-based electrode, herein, the interlayer distance expanding strategy was employed, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was introduced into ReS2. Few-layered ReS2nanosheets were grown on the surface of the rGO with expanded interlayer distance. The prepared ReS2nanosheets show an expanded distance (∼0.77 nm). The synthesized EI-ReS2@rGO composites were used in PIBs as anode materials. The K-ion storage mechanism of the ReS2-based anode was investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) technology, which shows the intercalation and conversion types. The EI-ReS2@rGO nanocomposites show high specific capacities of 432.5, 316.5, and 241 mAh g-1under 0.05, 0.2, and 1.0 A g-1current densities and exhibit excellent reversibility at 1.0 A g-1. Overall, this strategy, which finely tunes the local chemistry and orbital hybridization for high-performance PIBs, will open up a new field for other materials.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Design of novel transition-metal-doped c6n2 with high-efficiency polysulfide anchoring and catalytic performances toward application in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are highly expected because of their high theoretical specific capacity and energy density. However, its application still faces challenges, including the shuttle effect affecting the sulfur reduction reaction, the high decomposition energy barrier of Li2S during charging, the volume change of sulfur, and the poor conductivity during charging and discharging. Here, combined with density functional theory and particle swarm optimization algorithm for the nitrogen carbide monolayer structural search (CmN8-m, m = 1-8), the surprising discovery is that a single metal-Atom-doped C6N2 monolayer could effectively accelerate the conversion of lithium polysulfide and anchor lithium polysulfide during discharging and decrease the decomposition energy barrier of Li2S during charging. This ""anchoring and catalyzing"" mechanism effectively reduces the shuttle effect and greatly improves the reaction kinetics. Among a series of metal atoms, Cr is the best doping element, and it exhibits suitable adsorption energy for polysulfides and the lowest decomposition energy barrier for Li2S. This work opens up a new way for the development of transition-metal-doped carbon-nitrogen materials with an excellent catalytic activity for lithium polysulfide as cathode materials for Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Microreactor-Based TG-TEM Synchronous Analysis,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.It is challenging to measure the heating-induced mass change of the material during its morphological/structural evolution process. Herein, a silicon microreactor is developed for thermogravimetric-transmission electron microscopy synchronous analysis (TG-TEM synchronous analysis). A self-heating resonant microcantilever for mass-change detection and a dummy microcantilever with electron-beam transparent SiNxwindows for in situ TEM imaging are integrated back-to-back inside the microreactor. The TEM resolution of the microreactor reaches the Ångström level in an air atmosphere of 100 mbar, and the TGA function is realized by the heatable resonant microcantilever. The TG-TEM synchronous analysis has been successfully used to characterize two Ni(OH)2samples. During the in situ TEM observing process, the desorption of the intercalated H2O molecules and dehydration of the lattice OH groups in the amorphous Ni(OH)2·xH2O nanosheets can be clearly distinguished from the microcantilever-based TGA. For single-crystal Ni(OH)2nanosheets, the TG-TEM synchronous analysis can distinguish the desorption of physiosorbed water, the condensation of surface OH groups, and the dehydration of lattice OH groups. The amorphous Ni(OH)2nanosheets transformed to polycrystalline NiO completed at 290 °C, and the decomposition from the single-crystalline Ni(OH)2nanoplates to NiO at 315 °C is also clearly recognized. The proposed microreactor-based TG-TEM synchronous analysis provides an interrelated characterization platform to obtain more comprehensive information on materials.",Analytical Chemistry
Electrothermally Driven Nucleation Energy Control of Defective Carbon and Nickel-Cobalt Oxide-Based Electrodes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Multielement metal/metal oxides/carbon-based support hybrids are promising candidates for high-performance electrodes. However, conventional solid-state synthesis utilizing slow heating-cooling rates is limited by discrepancies in their phase transition temperatures. Herein, we report a rational strategy to control the nucleation energy of defective carbon fibers (DCFs) and Ni-Co-oxide-based electrodes capable of electrochemical activation using electrothermal waves (ETWs). The ETWs, triggered by Joule heating passing through CFs and Ni-Co precursors, induce programmable high-temperature processes via adjustable input powers and durations. The first ETW (∼1500 °C) fabricates the presculpted DCFs, while the second ETW (∼600 °C) directly synthesizes NiCo2O4spinel nanoparticles on the DCFs. Predesigning DCFs through the Gibbs free energy theory enables tunable control of nucleation energy and solution compatibility with Ni-Co precursors, allowing the morphological and compositional design of the optimal NiCo2O4@DCFs hybrids. Furthermore, they are electrochemically activated to change the morphologies and oxidation states of Ni-Co to more stable wrinkled structures strongly anchored to carbon supports and Ni-Co cations with low oxidation numbers. The activated NiCo2O4@DCFs electrodes exhibit outstanding specific capacitance and long-term cyclic stability (∼1925 F g-1and ∼115-123% for 20 000 cycles). The ETWs offer a facile yet precise method to predesign carbon supports and subsequently synthesize hybrid electrodes.",ACS Nano
Predominant Catalytic Performance of Nickel Nanoparticles Embedded into Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Quantum Dot-Based Nanosheets for the Nitroreduction of Halogenated Nitrobenzene,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.A novel structure of a porous carbon-metal composite was designed and constructed from nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (NCQDs) and Ni. NCQDs (3- 5 nm) with rich surface groups adsorbed with Ni ions can assemble into a carbon flake structure (50-60 nm) via atomic bonding, in which Ni is effectively dispersed and separated by NCQDs. Thus, a porous carbon nanosheet uniformly inlaid with metal nanoparticle (Ni@NCQDs) was built by subsequent thermal treatment. As a robust catalyst, Ni@NCQDs can promote the nitroreduction of p-chloronitrobenzene to pchloroaniline with high activity (100%) and selectivity (99.8%) at 4.28 times the reaction rate of commercial Raney Ni. The electron transfer between Ni nanoparticles and porous carbon nanosheets over the N-Ni interface is responsible for the excellent performance. Besides, the wide applicability of Ni@NCQDs for various nitroarenes suggests that Ni@ NCQDs have a potential to replace industrial catalysts (noble metal and Raney Ni). These findings confirm that the NCQDs, as an excellent carbon material, demonstrates a promising prospect of application in improving the catalytic performance of Ni-based catalysts.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering

All rights reserved.Hierarchical porous carbon nanosheet (HPCN) materials of different thicknesses were fabricated on Mg(OH)2substrates utilizing a one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach. The templated carbon nanosheets are closely packed hierarchical nanostructures possessing high surface areas varying from 1323 to 1978 m2·g-1. Symmetrical electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) were constructed using the HPCN and demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 205 F·g-1at 5 mV/s using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMIM-TFSI) as an electrolyte. The energy density was 86 Wh·kg-1, and a power density of up to 16.57 kW·kg-1was observed. After 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 10 A·g-1, the supercapacitor retained 90% of its initial capacity. This illustrates the great stability of the templated mesoporous carbon sheets for supercapacitors.",ACS Applied Energy Materials

Here, we report a whisker-free nonporous K metal anode with superior morphological stability that can self-modulate into ingot-type deposits on a standard current collector. Comparative investigations confirm the importance of interfacial solvation structures in achieving the ideal morphological stability and facile charge transfer kinetics. Further operando diagnosis revealed that the electrochemically refined K metal anode can enable stable K metal full-cell cycling.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Novel Sulfur-Containing Polymeric Cathode Material Prepared via an Inverse Vulcanization Method for Advanced Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been the research hotspot of next-generation energy storage technology in recent years due to their high theoretical specific capacity, safety, and cost-effectiveness. However, inevitable lithium polysulfide intermediates' dissolution and migration severely hamper their energy density and calendar life. Therefore, it is of significance to restrain the inevitable polysulfide shuttle effect in electrolytes. Herein, a new type of sulfur-containing polymeric cathode, poly(vinyl trimethoxysilane-co-sulfur) (PVTS), is successfully synthesized by an inverse vulcanization method to solve the polysulfide problem. The well-designed sulfur-containing polymer endows the Li-S battery with better performance, which has several features that are discussed below. First, the covalent bonding of the sulfur atom and the carbon atom of vinyl trimethoxysilane in PVTS effectually limits the polysulfide diffusion and further lessens the polysulfide dissolution, thereby preventing the loss of active materials. Second, a good liquid electrolyte wettability is conducive to the electrochemical reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In the end, a faster charge transfer rate and a favorable lithiation/delithiation kinetics facilitate the electrochemical process. Accordingly, the PVTS/C cathode shows significantly enhanced cycling stability after 500 cycles and excellent rate performance.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Synthesis of atomic form nickel co-catalysts on TiO2 for improved photocatalysis via the RAFT technique,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Using the high incompatibility between the neutral stabilizer body and the block polyelectrolyte to drive phase separation during polymerization-induced self-assembly, a modular approach to systematically adjust ionic monomer/polymer solubility was developed to effectively identify monomers suitable for RAFT aqueous dispersion polymerization, with strong phase separation ability to form worm phases over a wide range of compositions and even at very low solid content. The block copolymer PMPS-MPS-P([META+][PF6−]), prepared by this method, acts as a “nano bridge” and achieves Ni loading on TiO2 with the help of the sol-gel method + thermal reduction. The atomic loading of Ni on TiO2 is achieved through strong covalent bonding, metallic bonding and the natural physical intertwining effect of the silane coupling agent. Interestingly, it was unexpectedly found that the TiC stable structure generated by this process, the ionization of part of the block polyelectrolyte after the thermal reduction treatment at 773 K and the loading process of Ni all can promote the formation of oxygen vacancy Ov, which facilitates the charge transfer and hydrogen precipitation reaction. It has superior photocatalytic ability and cheaper cost compared to the conventional impregnation dispersion method. These findings provide a new idea to modify the manipulated photocatalysts by defect engineering to achieve efficient photocatalytic efficiency and capability.",New Journal of Chemistry
An overview of the application of atomic layer deposition process for lithium-ion based batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. International Journal of Energy Research published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Abstract: Lithium-ion battery (LIB) systems provide a very promising range of power supply systems for diverse applications like electric vehicles, hybrid plug-in electric vehicles, grid storage systems, and microelectronics. Nevertheless, the features of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which include energy density and power, cycle lifetime, safety, as well as cost, must be enhanced in order to achieve all these feasible applications. Atomic layer deposition (ALD), as a result of its unique benefits above other thin-film methods of deposition, emerges as a very useful approach for use in improving the efficiency of LIBs. This review summarizes ALD's advanced successes in designing new nanostructured solid-state electrolytes and electrode materials, as well as the adjustment of the interfaces of electrodes and electrolytes through the application of surface coatings for the avoidance of undesirable side reactions to attain maximum adequate performance of the electrode.

HF free greener Cl-terminated MXene as novel electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline media,"© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Hydrogen and oxygen evolution through electrochemical water splitting is essential for effective and inexpensive production of hydrogen and oxygen, which depends on the development of economical, and extremely active electrocatalysts. Two-dimensional (2D) nano-laminated materials are imperious as electrocatalysts due to their phenomenal properties and extensive scope of applications. In this work, we report a greener way of synthesizing MXene without hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment and demonstrated its excellent electrochemical characteristics as an overall water-splitting catalyst. Cl-terminated MXenes (Ti3C2Cl2) were synthesized via a molten salt approach, in which the MAX phase (Ti3AlC2) was reacted with copper chloride (CuCl2) salt followed by thermal treatment at a temperature of 550°C for 5 hours. The resulting Cl-terminated MXene was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, Raman, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical testing was performed in the alkaline media for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). For OER in 1 M KOH, Cl-terminated MXene achieves a benchmark of 30 mA cm−2 current density at an overpotential of 330 mV and a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec−1, while HF-MXene exhibits an overpotential of 390 mV and a Tafel slope of 136 mV dec−1. For HER, Cl-MXene attains an overpotential of 259 mV, and a Tafel slope of 92 mV dec−1 to achieve the 10 mA cm−2 current density, on the other hand, HF-MXene achieves an overpotential of 444 mV and a Tafel slope of 311 mV dec−1. Furthermore, the electrocatalyst exhibited excellent long-term stability of 0.7 V at 100 mA cm−2 current density for 36 hours. The synthesis methodology for greener Cl-terminated MXene coupled with an outstanding electrocatalytic activity is set to open new avenues of catalyst design for water splitting.",International Journal of Energy Research
"The influence of crystal growth mechanism based on various sulfur sources on the morphology, component and electrochemical performance of cobalt sulfide as anode material for sodium-ion batteries","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Cobalt sulfides (CoSx) have been paid lots of attention as promising anode candidates for sodium-ion batteries owing to their merits of high theoretical capacity, good electrochemical reversibility and superior thermal stability. However, the preparation of cobalt sulfide with the excellent rate capability and long-term cyclic stability is still a great challenge. Herein, we have prepared cobalt sulfides by one-step solvothermal method using four sulfur sources including sodium thiosulfate, thioacetamide, thiourea and L-Cysteine, respectively. And the mechanism of the bond energies and groups of sulfur source molecules influence the crystal growth process are studied. Moreover, the four cobalt sulfides with different components, morphologies and structures are tested and analyzed as the anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The CoSx using sodium thiosulfate as the sulfur source achieves an excellent cycling performance, which still has a capacity of 690.0 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1 with the retention of 98.1% and an outstanding rate capability of 626.6 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1. This superiority may be attributed to its pure component cobalt disulfide (CoS2) with abundant active sites and the unique morphology leading to the high material utilization. Our studies give a clear evidence that sulfur sources play an important role in the crystal growth and constructing high-performance sulfide-based anode materials.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Cobalt/three-dimensional carbon/reduced graphene oxide modified PP separator for Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, a composite of cobalt metal nanoparticles/three-dimensional carbon/reduced graphene oxide (Co-3DC-rGO) was synthesized using corn husk, ZIF-67, and graphene oxide as precursors. The Co-3DC-rGO was used to modify commercial PP to prepare the Co-3DC-rGO/PP separator. The performance of Co-3DC-rGO/PP separator was evaluated in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). SEM images exhibited that a three-dimensional carbon (3DC) skeleton was obtained by corn husk transformation, and the ZIF-67-derived cobalt-decorated carbon dodecahedrons were homogeneously filled into the hierarchical pores of the 3DC structure. TEM images displayed that Co metal nanoparticles can escape from ZIF-67 and scatter on the rGO nano-sheets and 3DC skeleton. Benefitting from the synergy effects of the 3D carbon skeleton, rGO, and Co metal nanoparticles, the electrochemical performance of LSBs with Co-3DC-rGO/PP separator is better than LSBs with commercial PP separator. When tested at 1C, the LSB with Co-3DC-rGO/PP separator presents a high stable reversible capacity of 516.3 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles. This research provides new ideas for the preparation of LSBs separator.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Single-atom site catalysts based on high specific surface area supports,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Single-atom site catalysts (SASCs) are characterized with atomically dispersed isolated metal active sites and theoretically 100% metal dispersion. Supports with high specific surface area are crucial for the fabrication of highly efficient SASCs with maximized metal dispersion. The high specific surface area supports provide anchoring sites that stabilize the monodispersed active metal atoms. The metal atoms and their coordination environment jointly constitute the metal single-atom sites, which represent the active sites of SASCs. The selection of suitable supports is one of the key factors that determine the structures and properties of SASCs. In this perspective, we introduce various types of SASCs based on high specific surface area supports from 0-dimension to 3-dimension with different sorts of active sites and coordination environments. In particular, we select the most representative high specific surface supports in each dimension and introduce the corresponding SASCs and how different supports cooperate with single metal atoms to achieve efficient catalysis. We summarize the current developments, and also present future opportunities and challenges of SASCs, aiming to provide an instructive perspective of the SASCs based on high specific surface area supports.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics

Dynamical Ion Association and Transport Properties in PEO-LiTFSI Electrolytes: Effect of Salt Concentration,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The association of ions describes the formation of ion species in electrolyte solutions and is strongly related to the salt concentration. However, the discussion of ion species and their transport is ambiguous in some studies on electrolyte materials due to the assumption of ideal solutions. Accordingly, in this work, molecular dynamics simulations are used to study ion association and transport properties of poly(ethylene)oxide (PEO)-lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide electrolytes over a range of salt concentrations (r = [Li]/[EO]) from 0.01 to 0.20. Based on the analysis of the solvation environment and ion species, it is revealed that the distinct ion-ion correlations exist in two different characteristic areas, with a salt concentration of 0.10 as the limit. Below the critical concentration, the dynamic equilibrium between free ions and ion pairs is the most important process affecting the transport properties of electrolytes, but the process may have a minor influence on the applicability of the Nernst-Einstein relation. In concentrated solutions, a large number of ion pairs, triplets, and so forth appear in the electrolytes. The high-order ion clusters, with an average size of 3.95 at r = 0.20, are the main stable structures for transporting Li+, but the trapped free ions are the most abundant ion species. Meanwhile, the effect of salt concentrations on the average transport of ion clusters is to increase their average lifetime, but their transport rates remain unchanged. In addition, the coupling dynamics between ions and polymers is also discussed in order to gain a complete insight into the importance of salt concentrations.",Journal of Physical Chemistry B
A N-Rich porous carbon nanocube anchored with Co/Fe dual atoms: an efficient bifunctional catalytic host for Li-S batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Although lithium-sulfur batteries have attracted increasing attention due to their high specific energy and low cost of electrode materials, their practical use is hindered by unfavorable electrochemical shuttling and sluggish conversion of polysulfides. In this work, we reported a nitrogen-rich porous carbon nanotube as the host material for the S cathode. Derived from metal organic frameworks, the carbon host was anchored with isolated cobalt/iron dual atoms, which acted as an efficient electrocatalyst to trigger the surface-mediated reaction of polysulfides. During the discharge-charge cycle of Li-S batteries, the Co/Fe sites work as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to facilitate reversible conversion reaction between S and Li2S. With a high S mass ratio of 72 wt%, S@C composites prepared from the above carbon host are able to deliver a high specific capacity of 1516 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and improved cycling stability (a low capacity decay of 0.08% per cycle after 300 cycles at 0.5C). This work demonstrates a rational strategy to boost the storage performance of the S cathode in rechargeable Li-S batteries.",Materials Chemistry Frontiers
Stabilizing Li-O2Batteries with Multifunctional Fluorinated Graphene,"© 2022 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.As a full cell system with attractive theoretical energy density, challenges faced by Li-O2 batteries (LOBs) are not only the deficient actual capacity and superoxide-derived parasitic reactions on the cathode side but also the stability of Li-metal anode. To solve simultaneously intrinsic issues, multifunctional fluorinated graphene (CFx, x = 1, F-Gr) was introduced into the ether-based electrolyte of LOBs. F-Gr can accelerate O2- transformation and O2-participated oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process, resulting in enhanced discharge capacity and restrained O2-derived side reactions of LOBs, respectively. Moreover, F-Gr induced the F-rich and O-depleted solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film formation, which have improved Li-metal stability. Therefore, energy storage capacity, efficiency, and cyclability of LOBs have been markedly enhanced. More importantly, the method developed in this work to disperse F-Gr into an ether-based electrolyte for improving LOBs' performances is convenient and significant from both scientific and engineering aspects.",Nano Letters
"Monolayer MSi2P4(M = V, Nb, and Ta) as Highly Efficient Sulfur Host Materials for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries","© 2022 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.Despite the high capacity and low cost of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, their commercialization is greatly blocked by multiple bottlenecks including the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), poor conductivity of sulfur, and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we propose novel two-dimensional MSi2P4 (M = V, Nb, and Ta) monolayers as promising sulfur hosts to improve the Li-S battery performance. Our calculations show that MSi2P4 monolayers offer moderate binding strengths to the polysulfides, which are expected to effectively inhibit the LiPS shuttling and dissolution. Moreover, the conductive properties of the MSi2P4 systems are well maintained after LiPS adsorption, eliminating the insulating nature of sulfur species. Remarkably, MSi2P4 monolayers exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity for the sulfur reduction reaction and the Li2S decomposition reaction, which considerably lowers the energy barriers of LiPS conversions during discharge and charge, thus ensuring the fast redox kinetics and high sulfur utilization of Li-S batteries. This study pioneers the application of MSi2P4 monolayers as highly efficient sulfur host materials for Li-S batteries and affords insights for further development of advanced Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
A thermal resistant and flame retardant separator reinforced by attapulgite for lithium-ion batteries via multilayer coextrusion,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMultilayer separators are widely used due to their wide shutdown window by combining lower melting temperature and higher melting temperature of different layers. With the development of high power lithium-ion batteries, multilayer separators equipped with effective thermal stability and flame retardancy are highly required. Herein, the poly(methyl methacrylate) modified attapulgite (ATPM) is selected as the heat resistant reinforcing component and blended with polypropylene (PP)/polyethylene (PE) respectively. Then we prepare PP(ATPM)/PE(ATPM) separators via multilayer coextrusion efficiently without multiple stretching processes, which can avoid serious separator shrinkage at elevated temperature. The intertwined ATPM could not only enhance the separator integrity, but also produce water vapor and oxide anti-flaming isolation layers at high temperatures. The as-prepared separators, referred to as MC-TIPS PP/PE/ATPM, exhibit higher thermal stability (with negligible dimensional shrinkage up to 180 °C), better flame retardancy and wider shutdown temperature window (124–183 °C) than the commercial multilayer separators. Moreover, the introduction of ester and hydroxyl groups could improve the wettability and electrolyte uptake of the separators. These properties, as well as the potential for large-scale production of multilayer coextrusion, make MC-TIPS PP/PE/ATPM an ideal choice for high-power battery separators.",Polymer
Controllable Solid-Phase Fabrication of an Fe2O3/Fe5C2/Fe-N-C Electrocatalyst toward Optimizing the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Zinc-Air Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.Preparing advanced electrocatalysts via solid-phase reactions encounters the challenge of low controllability for multiconstituent hybridization and microstructure modulation. Herein, a hydrothermal-mimicking solid-phase system is established to fabricate novel Fe2O3/Fe5C2/Fe-N-C composites consisting of Fe2O3/Fe5C2 nanoparticles and Fe,N-doped carbon species with varying morphologies. The evolution mechanism featuring a competitive growth of different carbon sources in a closed hypoxic space is elucidated for a series of Fe2O3/Fe5C2/Fe-N-C composites. The size and dispersity of Fe2O3/Fe5C2 nanoparticles, the graphitization degree of the carbonaceous matrix, and their diverse hybridization states lead to disparate electrocatalytic behaviors for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

Mass Production of Pt Single-Atom-Decorated Bismuth Sulfide for n-Type Environmentally Friendly Thermoelectrics,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Single-atom materials are widely explored in catalysis, batteries, sensors, etc. However, limited by mass production and centimeter-scale assembly, they are rarely studied in thermoelectrics. Herein, we demonstrate a solvothermal synthesis assisted by a syringe-pump method to yield Bi2S3-supported Pt single-atom materials (Bi2S3-Pt1) at a 10 g scale. Different from Ptn clusters, Pt1 single atoms can increase carrier concentration at a high doping efficiency and provide a unique atomic environment to enhance carrier mobility, and an enlarged effective mass leads to an enhanced Seebeck coefficient. As a result, a high power factor (348 μW m-1 K-2) is achieved at 823 K. Benefiting from the scattering of phonons by Pt1 atomic sites, a minimum thermal conductivity of 0.37 W m-1 K-1 is achieved. Consequently, the Bi2S3-0.5 wt % Pt1 realizes a record-high zT of ∼0.75 at 823 K, being among the best in the state-of-the-art n-type environmentally friendly metal sulfides. The enhancement of the carrier mobility and suppression of the thermal conduction by the unique Pt1 single atoms will inspire various fields, as exemplified by electronic devices and thermal management.",Nano Letters

An anionic regulation mechanism for the structural reconstruction of sulfide electrocatalysts under oxygen evolution conditions,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sulfides have long been regarded as a high-performance electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution; yet the actual structure of their active sites under working oxygen evolution conditions remains controversial. Herein, an anionic regulation mechanism is revealed on sulfide electrocatalysts under working oxygen evolution conditions. Specifically, the sulfides on the surface transform into oxysulfide by means of oxygen and sulfur anions leading to the co-construction of a multi-anionic structure. The multi-anionic structure regulates the electronic structure of the active sites and further enhances their electrocatalytic activity. More importantly, the in situ formed oxysulfide exhibits unexpected stability under working oxygen evolution conditions, manifesting the surface oxysulfide as the actual active site for oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. This work propels the fundamental understanding of the surface reconstruction and actual active sites of sulfide oxygen evolution electrocatalysts and inspires rational electrocatalyst design on advanced multi-anion compounds.",Energy and Environmental Science
Ultrathin and Porous 2D PtPdCu Nanoalloys as High-Performance Multifunctional Electrocatalysts for Various Alcohol Oxidation Reactions,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.We precisely synthesized two-dimensional (2D) PtPdCu nanostructures with the morphology varying from porous circular nanodisks (CNDs) and triangular nanoplates (TNPs) to triangular nanoboomerangs (TNBs) by tuning the molar ratios of metal precursors. The PtPdCu trimetallic nanoalloys exhibit superior electrocatalytic performances to alcohol oxidation reactions due to their unique structural features and the synergistic effect. Impressively, PtPdCu TNBs exhibit a high mass activity of 3.42 mgPt+Pd-1 and 1.06 A·mgPt-1 for ethanol and methanol oxidation compared to PtPd, PtCu, and pure Pt, which is 3.93 and 4.07 times that of commercial Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Moreover, 2D PtPdCu TNPs and PtPdCu CNDs also show a highly improved electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, as all-in-one electrocatalysts, PtPdCu nanoalloys display excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the oxidation of other alcohol molecules, such as isopropyl alcohol, glycerol, and ethylene glycol.

Heterostructured Palladium-Nickel Sulfide on Plasma-Activated Nickel Foil for Robust Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Transition-metal sulfides are among the effective electrocatalyst candidates for H2evolution (HER); however, they still cannot compete with Pt-based electrodes for renewable energy applications. To overcome this issue, grid-matched palladium-nickel sulfides (Pd4S/Ni3S2) are successfully engineered on the holey surface of nickel foil (HNF), which is first treated with a non-thermal plasma (HPNF) generated by a dielectric barrier discharge. The synthesized heterogeneous Pd4S-Ni3S2/HPNF catalyst results in the electron redistribution on the phase interfaces, enhancing the desorption ability of H∗ species. Consequently, Pd4S-Ni3S2/HPNF presents a high HER activity, and the overpotentials for generating 10 (j10) and 500 (j500) mA/cm2are about 44 and 247 mV. Meanwhile, the catalyst retains good electrocatalytic stability over 50 h at j100. In addition, the H2amount of Pd4S-Ni3S2/HPNF driven by the current j10can reach 11.25 mmol/h, which is competitive with other presently available high-performance electrocatalysts. The theory and in situ Raman spectroscopy results indicate that Pd4S and the heterointerfaces between the Pd4S and Ni3S2phases are the main active catalytic sites for H2evolution and that the Pd weakens the S-Hadsbonds, enhancing the reactive kinetics of the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps. This work provides a new and green approach for engineering highly active and stable electrocatalysts for clean hydrogen production.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
"Waste cigarette butt-derived B, N doped bifunctional hierarchical mesoporous carbon for supercapacitor and oxygen reduction reaction","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Utilization of hazardous waste into valuable materials is the prime need globally. Herein, discarded cigarette filters (a harmful waste/environmental hazard) were utilized to produce heteroatom (Nitrogen and Boron) doped hierarchical mesoporous carbon nanocomposite (NHMC and B-NHMC) via simple elegant hydrothermal route. The fabricated hierarchical mesoporous carbons (HMC), N-doped carbon (NHMC) and boron doped carbon (B-NHMC) composite exhibited high surface area about to 972, 1283 and 1869 m2 g−1 respectively with the mesoporosity (~ 13–16 nm). Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the hierarchical nature of the produced carbon. Elemental analysis (CHN) established the presence of C, H, N, B and O elements. Electrochemical studies showed remarkable super-capacitive behavior in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The specific capacitance of the fabricated electrode materials HMC, NHMC and B-NHMC was observed 309, 325 and 365 F g−1 respectively and was calculated through CV graphs at a potential of 2 mV s−1. Moreover, GCD showed an enhanced specific capacitance of 320, 355 and 373 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 for HMC, NHMC and B-NHMC sample electrodes. The capacitance retention graphs showed high retention of 91%, 93% and 95% after 5000 segments of charge discharge curves of HMC, NHMC and B-NHMC electrodes, which confirmed an excellent capacitance retention exhibited by the materials. An excellent electrocatalytic performance was exhibited by B-NHMC material for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with an onset and half wave potential of 0.975, 0.835 V respectively in O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, The value of Tafel slope of B-NHMC catalyst was examined 89.5 mV dec−1, which shows a close agreement with commercial Pt/C (20%) 87.7 mV dec−1, demonstrating good kinetic properties of B-NHMC catalyst, which is near about the commercial Pt/C (20%). The average number of electrons transferred during the ORR process is 3.96, which is found a close resemblance with the ideal four electrons ORR process. Thus, discarded cigarette filters can be smartly utilized as waste to manufacture heteroatom doped (N and B) hierarchical mesoporous carbon (NHMC/B-NHMC) composite at commercial scale to solve the municipality and environmental issue and to utilize in energy storage system and fuel cells.",Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects
Strategies to improve electrocatalytic performance of MoS2-based catalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryElectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) are a key process for hydrogen production for clean energy applications. HERs have unique advantages in terms of energy efficiency and product separation compared to other methods. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has attracted extensive attention as a potential HER catalyst because of its high electrocatalytic activity. However, the HER performance of MoS2 needs to be improved to make it competitive with conventional Pt-based catalysts. Herein, we summarize three typical strategies for promoting the HER performance, i.e., defect engineering, heterostructure formation, and heteroatom doping. We also summarize the computational density functional theory (DFT) methods used to obtain insight that can guide the construction of MoS2-based materials. Additionally, the challenges and prospects of MoS2-based catalysts for the HER have also been discussed.",RSC Advances
Reversing electron transfer in a covalent triazine framework for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs) have emerged as some of the most important materials for photocatalytic water splitting. However, development of CTF-based photocatalytic systems with non-platinum cocatalysts for highly efficient hydrogen evolution still remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrated, for the first time, a one-step phosphidation strategy for simultaneously achieving phosphorus atom bonding with the benzene rings of CTFs and the anchoring of well-defined dicobalt phosphide (Co2P) nanocrystals (∼7 nm). The hydrogen evolution activities of CTFs were significantly enhanced under simulated solar-light (7.6 mmol h−1 g−1), more than 20 times higher than that of the CTF/Co2P composite. Both comparative experiments and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the strong interfacial P-C bonding and the anchoring of the Co2P cocatalyst reverse the charge transfer direction from triazine to benzene rings, promote charge separation, and accelerate hydrogen evolution. Thus, the rational anchoring of transition-metal phosphides on conjugated polymers should be a promising approach for developing highly efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.",Chemical Science

Gas Sensing Technology for the Detection and Early Warning of Battery Thermal Runaway: A Review,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.With the increasing popularity of battery technology, the safety problems caused by the thermal runaway of batteries have been paid more attention. Detecting the gases released from battery thermal runaway by gas sensors is one of the effective strategies to realize the early safety warning of batteries. The inducing factors of battery thermal runaway as well as the types and mechanisms of the gases generated at each reaction stage are first reviewed. According to the amount and starting time of gas release, five gases suitable for early detection of battery thermal runaway are mainly introduced, including hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), ethylene (C2H4), and methane (CH4). The application prospects of various gas-sensing technologies in the detection and early warning of battery thermal runaway are further evaluated. Benefiting from the superiorities of small size, high sensitivity, and stable performance, the resistive gas sensors are considered as promising candidates in this field, and their sensing mechanisms are also described in this review. In addition, the applicability and optimization strategies of gas sensors for the detection and early warning of battery thermal runaway are further reviewed systematically, on the basis of various aspects including sensing material, material design, sensing performance, etc. Finally, the potential directions and key points for the future development of gas sensors in the detection and early warning of battery thermal runaway are proposed.",Energy and Fuels
Origin of luminescence properties and synthetic methods for gold- and bimetallic gold-based nanomaterials,"© 2022 RSC.Organic emissive dyes, which were first synthesized in the mid-19th century, have played a major role in the field of sensing and biological imaging for several decades. The extensive use of π conjugation in organic dyes has shown their red-shifted emission from the ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR) region. The emission property modulation is not only restricted to π conjugation, but also affects the rotation of their bonds, functional group modification and intermolecular interactions. The photobleaching property of organic dyes makes it necessary to develop alternative emissive molecules and materials. Among the alternative emissive sources, gold-based nanomaterials showed 10−4 to 10−5 quantum efficiency for the first time in 1998. The quantum yields of these systems are mostly low except for a few exceptional cases in comparison to organic dyes. However, the high extinction coefficient values of these gold-based nanomaterials overcome the issue of overall brightness. The high stability of gold-based nanomaterials has gained attention in sensing and biological applications. The origin of the emission in these gold-based nanomaterials varies significantly among bimetallic nanoclusters (BMNCs) and metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs). In this review article, we deliberate on the foundation of luminescence properties among gold-based nanomaterials and compare their synthetic methods in detail.",Materials Advances
Tale of Three Molecular Nitrides: Mononuclear Vanadium (V) and (IV) Nitrides As Well As a Mixed-Valence Trivanadium Nitride Having a V3N4Double-Diamond Core,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.

Complex 1 has a high-spin (S = 1) ground state and displays rhombic high-frequency and -field electron paramagnetic resonance (HFEPR) spectra, while complex 2 has an S = 3/2 4A2ground state observable by conventional EPR spectroscopy. Complex 1 reacts with NaN3to form the VVnitride-azide complex [(TptBu,Me)VN(N3)] (3). A likely VIIIazide intermediate en route to 3, [(TptBu,Me)VCl(N3)] (4), was isolated by reacting 1 with N3SiMe3. Complex 4 is thermally stable but reacts with NaN3to form 3, implying a bis-azide intermediate, [(TptBu,Me)V(N3)2] (A), leading to 3. Reduction of 3 with KC8furnishes a trinuclear and mixed-valent nitride, [{(TptBu,Me)V}2(μ4-VN4)] (5), conforming to a Robin-Day class I description. Complex 5 features a central vanadium ion supported only by bridging nitride ligands. Contrary to 1, complex 2 reacts with NaN3to produce an azide-bridged dimer, [{(TptBu,Me)V}2(1,3-μ2-N3)2] (6), with two antiferromagnetically coupled high-spin VIIions. Complex 5 could be independently produced along with [(κ2-TptBu,Me)2V] upon photolysis of 6 in arene solvents. The putative {VIVN} intermediate, [(TptBu,Me)VN] (B), was intercepted by photolyzing 6 in a coordinating solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), yielding [(TptBu,Me)VN(THF)] (B-THF). In arene solvents, B-THF expels THF to afford 5 and [(κ2-TptBu,Me)2V]. A more stable adduct (B-OPPh3) was prepared by reacting B-THF with OPPh3. These adducts of B are the first neutral and mononuclear VIVnitride complexes to be isolated.",Journal of the American Chemical Society

"Ultrasensitive sandwich-type photoelectrochemcial oxytetracycline sensing platform based on MnIn2S4/WO3 (Yb, Tm) functionalized rGO film","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) detection system was constructed based on reduced oxide graphene (rGO) film as substrate and MnIn2S4/WO3 (Yb, Tm) Z-scheme heterojunction as signal matrix.

With great electron transfer property, rGO further promotes the separation of photo-generated carrier, resulting in the amplification of detection signal. The sandwich-type detection mode is introduced to increase the sensitivity and enhance the specificity. Under the optimal conditions, the PEC detection system presented great property in oxytetracycline (OTC) detection with a linear range from 4 × 10-5 nM to 5 × 10-2 nM and a low limit of detection as 1.3 × 10-5 nM (5.99 × 10-3 ng L-1).

Progress in the Preparation and Application of Electrocatalysts Based on Microorganisms as Intelligent Templates,"© Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.The storage and conversion of renewable energy through electrocatalysis is of considerable significance for improving the energy structure, protecting the ecological environment, and achieving the national strategy of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. The development of low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts has become a major scientific challenge worldwide. Microorganisms are widely found in nature and are characterized by their rich structure, composition and metabolism. These properties facilitate their use as intelligent templates for electrocatalyst structures and as sources of non-metallic elements such as carbon, phosphorus, sulfur, as well as metallic elements. The use of microorganisms in electrocatalyst production has become a new trend owing to the advantages of non-toxicity, reproducible production, and ease of scaling up. Thus, this paper reviews the development of microbial “intelligence” guided preparation of electrocatalysts and their current applications in the fields of hydrogen evolution reactions, oxygen evolution reactions, oxygen reduction reactions, carbon dioxide reductions and lithium batteries. In order to achieve the function of “intelligent” guidance of microorganisms, four aspects need to be addressed: (1) the selection of suitable microbial species and the culture and activation conditions, which significantly helps in tailoring the microbial properties for specific applications; (2) the exploration of microbial species that can accumulate metal species from their living environment and thus produce metal nanoparticles, which will help obtain nanocomposites with desired properties; (3) the selection of compounds with good catalytic properties, high stability, and compatibility with microbial substrates; and (4) the development of highly controllable nanocatalysts through modern molecular biology and genetic engineering to regulate microbial life processes such as metabolic proliferation and apoptosis. With the resolution of these issues, we believe that the application of microbial intelligent templates guided electrocatalysts can be further extended to other electrocatalytic reactions such as ethanol oxidation reactions (EOR), nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR), and to other applications in fields such as electronics, sensing, imaging, and biomedicine. The goal of this review is to promote a deeper understanding of the correlations among microbial metabolism, catalyst micro-nano structures and structure-activity relationships. Furthermore, the challenges associated with such materials and the prospects for future development are discussed herein.",Wuli Huaxue Xuebao/ Acta Physico - Chimica Sinica
Three-Dimensional Macro-/Mesoporous C-TiC Nanocomposites for Dendrite-Free Lithium Metal Anode,"© Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.In previous decades, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) were the most commonly used energy storage systems for powering portable electronic devices because LIBs exhibit reliable cyclability. However, owing to the low specific capacity of graphite used in the anode, further increase in the energy density of LIBs was limited. The Li metal anode is promising for the construction of next-generation high-energy-density batteries because of its ultrahigh theoretical capacity (3860 mAh·g−1 ) and low redox potential (−3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, the high activity of Li causes dendritic growth during cycling, which leads to cracking of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), increase in side reactions, and formation of dead Li. Several strategies have been proposed to address these issues, including use of electrolyte additives, high-concentration electrolytes, protection of the Li metal surface with various coatings, use of solid-state electrolytes, and design of a three-dimensional (3D) “Li host” for regulating the nucleation and deposition of Li metal. Among them, the design of a 3D “Li host” has proven to be a simple and effective strategy. However, the commonly used 3D “Li hosts” include nanostructured carbons, which are lithiophobic and, thus, provide limited interaction sites with Li+ ions, leading to the deposition of Li metal on the “Li host” surface. Therefore, it is necessary to design a 3D “Li host” with enhanced interaction with Li+ ions to achieve uniform deposition. Herein, we develop a soft-hard templating route to synthesize 3D macro-/mesoporous C-TiC (denoted as 3DMM C-TiC) nanocomposites, which has been used in Li metal batteries. The as-synthesized materials possess high surface areas (~510 m2·g−1 ), ordered structures, large pore volumes, and excellent conductivity. The continuous plating and stripping of Li metal and the formation of the hierarchically porous structure with sufficient volume to allow uniform Li deposition result in the alleviation of the volume change. The high specific surface area significantly decreases the local current density and suppresses dendrite growth. Consequently, ultrasmall TiC nanoparticles are uniformly distributed in the 3D macro-/mesoporous framework, which improves conductivity, enhances their interaction with Li+ ions, and promotes the uniform deposition of Li metal. Therefore, the fabricated 3DMM C-TiC||Li battery displays stable cycling performance with improved Coulombic efficiency (98%) over 300 cycles. Moreover, when the 3DMM C-TiC based Li metal anode is assembled with a LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode, the resultant full cells exhibit high specific capacity and excellent cycling stability. This study provides insight for the effective design of a 3D “Li host” for dendrite-free Li metal anodes.",Wuli Huaxue Xuebao/ Acta Physico - Chimica Sinica
Trimetallic metal–organic frameworks and derived materials for environmental remediation and electrochemical energy storage and conversion,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Nowadays, there is much research focused on advanced technologies for energy storage and conversion in order to mitigate environmental pollution and address concerns on future energy crises. Supercapacitors, batteries, and electrocatalytic splitting of water are some of the very important technologies in this field with a constantly growing attention. The development of an ideal and efficient electrode material made of non-noble metals with good stability and behavior represents the main challenge in these fields. Metal−organic frameworks (MOFs), composed of metal ions and organic linkers, are appealing materials because of their remarkable structural diversity, tunable pore sizes and topologies, tailorable surface chemistry, and multiple functionalities. Engineering structural and electronic states of MOFs through decoration of functional entities is an effective way to advance the design of electrocatalysts and enhance their properties. Compared to mono- and bimetallic metal–organic frameworks, multimetallic MOFs may have several advantages in the context of new energy technologies, namely a significantly enhanced electrochemical activity and electronic conductivity due to possible synergic effect. Addition of other metals to secondary building units (SBUs) of a MOF structure is an effective method for enhancing its electrochemical behavior and electrical conductivity, owing to an increasing number of exposed active sites, superior charge capacity, and charge transfer between different ions. A stability problem of pristine MOFs can also be solved by incorporating second and third metals that are less affected by hydrolysis. In heterotrimetallic MOFs, the ratios of metals can be adjusted and controlled, allowing to tune various physicochemical properties. Moreover, the materials obtained from the calcination of trimetallic MOFs can preserve their porosity, so the morphology of an electrocatalyst prepared in this way can be adjusted during the synthesis of metal–organic framework. In this review, recent developments in heterotrimetallic MOFs and derivatives as extraordinary materials for applications in electrocatalytic water splitting, batteries, supercapacitors, and other environmentally significant uses are discussed. This work extends prior reviews on mono- and bimetallic MOF-based systems with a main goal of creating a roadmap for the introduction of heterotrimetallic MOFs as more advanced materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Constructing highly stable lithium storage materials by improving the bond strength of MoS2 to graphene via chitosan,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMoS2 is considered a promising substitute anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its two-dimensional layered structure and large theoretical specific capacity. However, the low conductivity and poor structural stability of MoS2 limit its practical applications. Here, a simple self-assembly strategy is adopted to successfully synthesize MoS2/C@G with a 3D porous hybrid nanosheet structure. By utilizing the chitosan can effectively bonding the layered MoS2 with N-doped graphene to construct a layered sandwich-like structure, which ensures the uniform and non-agglomeration distribution of the synthesized few-layer MoS2 nanosheets between graphene sheets. In addition, the strong bond between MoS2 and graphene makes these two components tightly bonded, which greatly improves the electronic conduction and guarantees structural stability. Based on the above advantages, MoS2/C@G as the electrode for LIBs exhibits high reversible capacity and superior cycling stability, with a capacity of 667.7 mAh g−1 at a high current density of 0.5 A g−1 after ultra-long 1000 cycles, even without significant capacity decay.

Recent advances in metal organic framework and cellulose nanomaterial composites,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely used in various emerging fields due to their attractive characteristics, such as large specific surface area, highly porous structure, tunable porosity and pore size, versatile surface chemistry, diverse topological structure, and high chemical and thermal stability. However, nanoscale MOFs are prone to agglomeration, and their inherently crystalline structure leads to poor flexibility, processability and recyclability, which seriously limit the performance and application of MOFs. To address these deficiencies, MOFs have been composited with other materials through different strategies. One such attractive material is cellulose nanomaterials (CNMs), the most abundant and sustainable biomass on the earth. Herein, recent advances in the MOF/CNM composites in terms of preparation approaches, general properties, and emerging applications are overviewed, aiming to provide some useful guidance to researchers on the rational design of high-performance MOF/CNM composites in different forms for advanced applications in the future. Particularly, MOFs and CNMs are usually compounded in aqueous solutions through two main strategies, i.e., in-situ synthesis and ex-situ blending. Further processing of as-prepared MOF/CNM aqueous mixtures can generate MOF/CNM composites in four forms, i.e., hydrogel, powder, membrane and aerogel. Benefitted from advantages of both MOFs and CNMs, MOF/CNM composites hold exceptional high specific surface area, hierarchically porous structure, as well as superior electrochemical, mechanical and antibacterial properties, which can be further modulated and enhanced through optimizing type and composition of MOFs and CNMs, preparation method, and addition of other functional components.

The success for a coupled electrolysis relies on not only the appropriate anodic and cathodic reaction pairs but also the suitable electrocatalysts that show high intrinsic activity, barrier-free ionic and electronic transport to the catalytic centers. Towards this goal, we showcased an efficient coupled electrolysis composed of the chloride oxidation reaction and the CO2 reduction reaction, in which the hexagonally ordered mesoporous electrocatalysts in terms of cobalt oxide and nickel, nitrogen co-doped carbons were used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, respectively. Benefiting from the unique mesoporous structures, both the anodic and cathodic reactions exhibited prominent electrocatalytic performance in chloride salt electrolyte. Impressively, the coupled electrolysis showed a Faraday efficiency of 97% and 87% for CO and ClO−, respectively at cell voltage of ca. 2.5 V and current density of 20 mA cm−2. By doing so, a reduction in cell voltage by 1.8 V and an increase in energy efficiency by 40% were obtained as compared to the conventional system composed of cathodic CO2 reduction and anodic O2 evolution. This work not only highlights the importance of ordered mesoporous transport channels in accelerating the catalytic kinetics, but also showcases a high-performance coupled model for overall electrolysis.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Trade-off effect of 3d transition metal doped boron nitride on anchoring polysulfides towards application in lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Sulfur cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) suffer from the notorious “shuttle effect”, low sulfur use ratio, and tardy transformation of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), while using two-dimensional (2D) polar anchoring materials combined with single-atom catalysis is one of the promising methods to address these issues. Herein, the 3d transition metal (TM) doped 2D boron nitrides (BN), labeled as TM-BN, are studied for the anchoring and redox kinetics of LiPSs using first principles calculations. From the simulated results, the TM atom and adjacent N atoms are active adsorption sites for binding S atoms in LiPSs/S8 and Li atoms in LiPSs, respectively. A negative d-band center closer to the Fermi level of TM-BN is key for enhancing the binding strength of TM-S and lowering the Li2S decomposition energy barrier, while it deteriorates the activity of adjacent N atoms. Fortunately, the electrolyte environment has little effect on the superiority of the TM-BN for binding polysulfides/S8, guaranteeing the sturdy anchor of polysulfides/S8 in realistic conditions. The trade-off effect on the activities of TM and adjacent N atom sites in TM-BN for binding LiPSs highlights the excellence of Ti/V/Cr-BN as modification materials for LSB.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Dual anion-doped porous carbon embraced TiO2 nanocrystals with long-term cycling performance for sodium ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.TiO2 as one of critical anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) has excellent characteristics such as low cost, high safety, small volume expansion and high packing density. However, low conductivity and poor sodium ion diffusion ability prevent its further applications in SIBs. Thus, achieving functionalized carbon embraced TiO2 nanocrystals (NCs) becomes an alternative to boost the TiO2 performance in SIBs. Herein, using NH2-MIL-125 (Ti) and sulfur powder as template and sulfur source, N, S dual-anion doped porous carbon embraced ultrafine TiO2 NCs (TiO2@NSPC) are successfully constructed. Due to a large surface-to-volume ratio of TiO2 NCs, the transport pathway of sodium ions is greatly shortened. Meanwhile, N, S dual-anion doped porous carbon can ameliorate the electrical conductivity and transport efficiency of ions, effectively inhibiting the agglomeration of TiO2 NCs. As a result, when used as the anode of SIBs, TiO2@NSPC shows a reversible capacity of 230.2 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g-1, with high capacity retention of 88.9%. Moreover, it exhibits extremely high cycling stability with a capacity of 63 mAh g-1 even at 10 A g-1 after 20000 cycles, and higher pseudocapacitive sodium storage than single heteroatom doping, causing its superior sodium ion storage capability. This strategy opens up a new situation to design new electrode materials with enhanced pseudocapacitance and superior sodium storage.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Triazine-based two dimensional porous materials for visible light-mediated oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides with O2,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Recently, triazine-based two dimensional (2D) porous materials have received increasing attention in photocatalysis. Herein, CTF-1, a covalent triazine framework, was adopted as the blueprint for designing a 2D bespoke photocatalyst. The thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TzTz) linkage was inserted into the framework of CTF-1, affording TzTz-TA, which belongs to conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs). Rather than the direct insertion via the challenging C[sbnd]H activation, TzTz-TA was assembled from 2,4,6-tris(4-formylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine and dithiooxamide, in which TzTz was formed in situ by a process of catalyst-free solvothermal condensation. Both CTF-1 and TzTz-TA had similar energy gaps (Eg), photocurrents, and charge carrier lifetimes, in line with the similar molecular underpinnings. However, the reduction potential of TzTz-TA is less negative than that of CTF-1 due to the insertion of TzTz linkage, in a more appropriate position for activating O2 to superoxide (O2•–). In return, blue light-mediated oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides with O2 over TzTz-TA was accomplished with significantly superior conversions to those over CTF-1. Intriguingly, extensive sulfides could be oxidized to corresponding sulfoxides with outstanding recycling stability of TzTz-TA. Notably, attendance of an induction period was observed during TzTz-TA photocatalysis. This work highlights the vast potential of designing triazine-based porous materials to meet the tailor-made demands, such as the oxidative transformation of organic molecules with O2.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
"In-situ construction of ultrathin MoP-MoS2 heterostructure on N, P and S co-doped hollow carbon spheres as nanoreactor for efficient hydrogen evolution","© 2022Rational design hierarchical nano-heterojunction electrocatalysts with high activity and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are attractive for sustainable energy conversion. Here, one-step and space-confine pyrolysis strategy is demonstrated to in-situ construct ultrathin MoP-MoS2 heterostructure on N, P and S co-doped hollow carbon spheres (MoP-MoS2/HCSs) that present remarkable HER performance. The intimate contact among MoP outer-layer, MoS2 intermediate layer and N, P and S co-doped HCSs inner-layer facilitates the formation of triple-shelled heterogeneous nanoreactor. Benefiting from abundant active sites, high specific surface area, heteroatomic doping, intimate catalyst-substrate contact and ultrathin active heterostructure, the resulting MoP-MoS2/HCSs not only displays significant electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials (71 mV and 125 mV in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively) at current density of 10 mA cm−2, but exhibits outstanding stability toward HER process. This study offers a promising approach to design hierarchical nano-heterojunction with remarkable electrochemical properties for green energy development.",Chemical Engineering Journal
In-situ coupling FeN nanocrystals with Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles to N-doped carbon nanosheets for efficient oxygen electrocatalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Hetero-nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon show promising potential application in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) based composite with FeN species and Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanosheets (Fe/Fe3C@FeN-Cs) has been successfully synthesized by an in-situ reduction of pre-designed Fe-N2-O2 units. Benefit from the compositional and structural synergistic effect, the optimized Fe/Fe3C@FeN-C-900 displays excellent ORR activity in both acidic (E1/2 = 0.77 V) and alkaline (E1/2 = 0.88 V) electrolytes, which are comparable and even superior to the benchmark Pt/C. Impressively, the maximum power density of fuel cell using Fe/Fe3C@FeN-C-900 as cathode catalyst reaches 408 mW cm−2. Moreover, the Fe/Fe3C@FeN-C-900-drived rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) deliver a higher power density (156.8 mW cm−2), larger specific capacity (775 mA h g−1) and better cycling stability (270 cycles) as compared with the state-of-the-art Pt/C counterpart. The interfacial electron transfer between Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles and neighboring FeN species, as well as the porous carbon architecture contribute to the excellent ORR performance of Fe/Fe3C@FeN-C-900, resulting in the easily adsorption/activation of O2 and accelerated ORR kinetics because of the fast mass transfer. The COF-derived synthetic strategy inspires new perspectives to develop hetero-nanoparticle composites as high-efficiency ORR electrocatalysts for the economical-practical energy conversion devices.",Applied Surface Science
