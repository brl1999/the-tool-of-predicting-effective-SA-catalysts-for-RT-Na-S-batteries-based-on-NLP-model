Lychee seed-derived microporous carbon for high-performance sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSodium-sulfur (Na–S) batteries are regarded as one of the promising next-generation energy storage systems; while being more cost-effective than lithium-sulfur batteries, Na–S batteries also suffer from the shuttle effect. Different strategies to tackle the long-chain polysulfide product shuttling issue have been proposed, mainly focusing on sulfur product confinement with costly materials and complex methods. Seeking high-performance and low-cost electrode material precursors is of great importance to promoting Na–S battery applications. We present a high specific surface area microporous carbon framework synthesized from degradable biowaste, namely lychee seeds, with a facile room-temperature etching process. Unlike the traditional dissolution-precipitation mechanism, a quasi-solid-state route takes place with the help of micropore (0.48 nm) confinement, preventing the formation of long-chain polysulfides for excellent electrochemical performance. The obtained Na–S battery exhibits an outstanding initial reversible discharge specific capacity of 1395 mAh g−1 at 0.2C and still maintains a high capacity of 518 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1.0C. The lychee seed-derived microporous carbon provides insights into sustainable and scalable host fabrication for high-performance sulfur-based batteries.",Carbon,10.1016/j.carbon.2022.09.075
Oxygen vacancy-mediated amorphous GeOx assisted polysulfide redox kinetics for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The practical applications of room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries have been greatly hindered by the natural sluggish reaction kinetics of sulfur and the shuttle effect of sodium polysulfide (NaPSs). Herein, oxygen vacancy (OV)-mediated amorphous GeOx/nitrogen doped carbon (donated as GeOx/NC) composites were well designed as sulfur hosts for RT Na–S batteries. Experimental and density functional theory studies show that the introduction of oxygen vacancies on GeOx/NC can effectively immobilize polysulfides and accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfides. Meanwhile, the micro-and mesoporous framework, acting as a reactor for storing active S, is conducive to alleviating the expansion of S during the charging/discharging process. Consequently, the S@GeOx/NC cathode affords a reversible capacity of 1017 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles, outstanding rate capability of 333 mA h g−1 at 10.0 A g−1 and long lifespan cyclability of 385 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1200 cycles. This work furnishes a new way for the rational design of metal oxides with oxygen vacancies and boosts the application for RT Na-S batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2022.09.071
Ce(NO3)4: A dual-functional electrolyte additive for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries face enormous challenges in the coulombic efficiency, capacity retention, and rate performance, which are seriously related to the solid electrolyte interface film, the shuttle effect of polysulfide, and the sodium-sulfur reaction kinetics. Adjusting the electrolyte composition by additives can significantly improve the battery performance and is attracting tremendous attention. However, the reported additives mainly focus on one of the two electrodes. It is still a considerable challenge to balance both aspects. This work proposes a novel dual-functional additive, Ce(NO3)4, and studies its comprehensive influence on the battery performance by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electrochemical techniques. The results show that Ce(NO3)4 generates NaCeO2 and NaNO3 to deposit on the Na surface. This inert deposition layer inhibits the side reactions between Na and polysulfides and optimizes the Na dissolution/deposition process, thereby improving the cycle stability of the battery. In addition, Ce4+ has a strong adsorption effect on capturing and evenly depositing polysulfides on the S cathode to inhibit the shuttle effect. In short, the Ce(NO3)4 additive plays a dual function of protecting the Na anode and optimizing the S cathode reaction.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.137978
An extraordinary Na-S battery enabled by a carbon nanosheet host loaded with Fe-accelerator and TiO2-inhibitor,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The inexpensive room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery has attracted extensive attention due to its various potential application but is still suffering from the low utilization of sulfur, the shuttle effect and the sluggish reaction activity of sodium polysulfides (SPSs). In this work, a TiO2/sulfur/atomic-iron loaded carbon nanosheet cathode is designed for high performance RT Na-S battery. When the atomic iron exists, a much higher electrochemical activity of sulfur was obtained, indicating the atomic iron can accelerate the conversion of SPSs. Furthermore, the TiO2 layer can inhibit the shuttle effect of SPSs and the side-reaction between the intermediates and carbonate electrolyte. As a result, the constructed sulfur cathode exhibits a high reversible capacity (569.9 mAh g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of 57.57%) at 0.1 A g−1 and outstanding cycling performance (507 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles). This work provides a new strategy for preparing high performance cathode materials for RT Na-S battery.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154496
An electrochemically stable homogeneous glassy electrolyte formed at room temperature for all-solid-state sodium batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s).All-solid-state sodium batteries (ASSSBs) are promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage. However, there are no commercialized ASSSBs yet, in part due to the lack of a low-cost, simple-to-fabricate solid electrolyte (SE) with electrochemical stability towards Na metal. In this work, we report a family of oxysulfide glass SEs (Na3PS4−xOx, where 0 < x ≤ 0.60) that not only exhibit the highest critical current density among all Na-ion conducting sulfide-based SEs, but also enable high-performance ambient-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. By forming bridging oxygen units, the Na3PS4−xOx SEs undergo pressure-induced sintering at room temperature, resulting in a fully homogeneous glass structure with robust mechanical properties. Furthermore, the self-passivating solid electrolyte interphase at the Na|SE interface is critical for interface stabilization and reversible Na plating and stripping. The new structural and compositional design strategies presented here provide a new paradigm in the development of safe, low-cost, energy-dense, and long-lifetime ASSSBs.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-022-30517-y
Effect of specifically-adsorbed polysulfides on the electron transfer kinetics of sodium metal anodes,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesRoom-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries hold great promise for large-scale energy storage applications owing to the high energy density and earth-abundance of Na and S. However, the dissolution and migration of sodium polysulfides, uncontrollable Na dendrite growth, and the lack of studies on Na electrodeposition kinetics have hindered the development of these batteries. Herein, we reveal the mechanism of sodium polysulfides on the Na plating/stripping kinetics using a three-electrode system. First, the kinetic behavior deviates from the commonly supposed Butler–Volmer model, which is well described by the Marcus model. In addition, the specific adsorption of polysulfides on the sodium electrode surface is a key factor influencing the kinetics. Higher-order polysulfides (S82− and S62−) exhibit distinct specific adsorption behaviors because of their high adsorption energies compared to lower-order polysulfides (S42− and S22−). The electrostatic effect caused by specific adsorption can accelerate the kinetics, whereas the blocking effect can slow the kinetics. Thus, this competitive relationship enables low concentrations of high-order polysulfides to stimulate kinetics. This implies that a weak shuttle effect is beneficial for obtaining a stable Na deposition in RT Na-S batteries. An in-depth understanding of the Na electrodeposition kinetics provides beneficial clues for future metal sodium/electrolyte interface designs.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2022.07.008
A highly-efficient electrocatalyst for room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries: assembled nitrogen-doped hollow porous carbon spheres decorated with ultrafine α-MoC1-x nanoparticles,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.While room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery is considered one of the most promising technologies for next-generation energy storage, its commoditization is constrained by the shuttling and sluggish redox kinetics of the sulfur electrode. Herein, a honeycomb-like sulfur electrocatalyst with ultrafine α-MoC1-x nanoparticles uniformly distributed on nitrogen-doped hollow porous carbon spheres (MoC@NHC) is designed and synthesized. Prepared through a template-assisted strategy followed by a self-assembly and pyrolysis process, the interconnected hollow porous structure of MoC@NHC provides not only a microenvironment for confinement of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) but also sufficient free space for accommodation of volume change during electrochemical cycling. Moreover, the polar α-MoC1-x nanoparticles coupled with N-doped carbon provides strong affinity to NaPSs and promote catalytic conversion of NaPSs, as confirmed by experimental results and theoretical calculations. Owing to the physical and chemical dual confinement effect and the fast conversion kinetics of NaPSs, the S/MoC@NHC-15 cathode demonstrates good rate performances (351.8 mAh g−1 at 10 C) and outstanding cyclability (retaining capacities of 418.4 and 312.6 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1 and 5 C, respectively). This study introduces a simple and effective method for fabrication of S/MoC@NHC cathode materials for high-performance RT Na-S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.07.028
Surface Film Formation from Sodium Polysulfide Decomposition on Sodium-Metal Anode Surface,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries are being considered as an alternative next generation of energy storage devices to replace lithium-sulfur batteries due to lower costs of Na metal while keeping a high theoretical capacity. A comprehensive understanding of polysulfide decomposition mechanisms and passivation film formation on the Na-metal surface has challenged the development of this metal-sulfur chemistry. Here, using first-principles modeling, we study the adsorption of sodium polysulfide (NaPS) molecules on the Na-metal surface and investigate the Na2S film formation from soluble NaPS decomposition in the presence of different electrolyte solvents (i.e., EC, PC, and EC/PC mixture). We find that NaPS molecules strongly interact with the Na-metal surface via Na-S bonds, leading to charge migration from the metal to the adsorbates. Such strong adsorption precedes a complete spontaneous electron-transfer decomposition of NaPS to form an amorphous Na2S film on the anode surface. The reduction reaction mechanisms are identified for each electrolyte, suggesting that polysulfides are completely decomposed in a short time. The energetic properties suggest that the first and second steps in the reaction of NaPS decomposition in the mixture solvent are thermodynamically uphill. The decomposed S atoms from NaPS can insert into the Na slab, leading to Na2S formation. The decomposition of multiple NaPS molecules reveals that the reduction of further NaPS on the surface after the first one is sluggish and incomplete because of the passivating nature of the nascent Na2S film, while NaPS far from the surface remains in the electrolyte phase forming a soluble NaPS cluster dissolved in the solvent.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c05223
Robust Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries Enabled by a Sandwich-Structured MXene@C/Polyolefin/MXene@C Dual-functional Separator,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na-S) batteries are attracting increased attention due to their high theoretical energy density and low-cost. However, the traditional RT-Na-S batteries assembled with glass fiber (GF) separators are still hindered by the polysulfide shuttle effect and sodium dendrite growth, limiting the battery's capacity and cycling stability. Here, a facile and effective method toward commercial polyolefin separators for constructing stable RT-Na-S batteries is presented. By coating commercial polypropylene membrane with core-shell structured MXene@C nanosheets, a powerful dual-functional separator with improved electrolyte wettability that can inhibit polysulfide migration and induce uniform sodium disposition is developed. More importantly, the modified separator can also accelerate the conversion kinetics of sodium polysulfides. Benefiting from these characteristics, the as-prepared RT-Na-S battery exhibits a remarkably enhanced capacity (1159 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C) and excellent cycling performance (95.8% of capacity retention after 650 cycles at 0.5 C). This study opens a promising avenue for the development of high-performance Na-S batteries.",Small,10.1002/smll.202106983
Chitin-Derived Heteroatom-Doped Porous Carbon for High-Performance Room-Temperature Na-S Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Porous carbon derived from biomass is considered as a promising active electrode material for the next-generation energy storage systems. Herein, carbon particles with a hierarchical structure are fabricated from chitin through a facile pyrolysis/activation process, which is loaded with sulfur (S) as the cathode material in a room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery. Owing to the large specific surface area, enriched microporous structure, and nitrogen and oxygen-self-doping, the obtained carbon particles can not only provide abundant active sites for energy storage and rapid ion transport channels but also improve the utilization of S. Consequently, the S-cathode achieves an excellent cycle stability of 230 mAh g-1at a current density of 1 A g-1after 2000 cycles with a capacity retention of a94%. According to the kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculation, the unique and robust structure of carbon particles enables physical encapsulation and chemical confinement of S and polysulfides (PSs), which can strengthen Na+adsorption and diffusion. Therefore, this work established a universal technique for producing high-performance S-cathode materials, which may offer the potential for economical energy storage in RT Na-S batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.2c02417
Metalized Polyacrylates as Efficient Binder for a Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile/Polydopamine Active Material in Sulfur Cathodes for Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Promising binder systems with special chemical and mechanical functions are under extensive exploration to cope with serious volume change and harmful shuttle effect occurring during charge/discharge cycles of a sulfur cathode in sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries. In this aspect, sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN)/polydopamine (PDA) active materials are combined with different metalized polyacrylates (MPAAs) to result in a SPAN/PDA/MPAA binder system with peculiar morphology and superior mechanical and interfacial strengths. As the outer layer of SPAN/PDA/MPAA, MPAA can extend its long chains to interact with cathode components and, moreover, metal ions of MPAA can participate in the beneficial electron transport process. The results suggest that stability and electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathodes depend on the applied metal ions, which become better and better as the valence of metal ions change from mono (Na), di (Ca), and tri (Fe) to tetra (Ti). Cathode derived from SPAN/PDA/titanium polyacrylate (TiPAA) shows the best stability and electrochemical performance, exhibiting a rather high specific capacity of 1438 mAh g-1at 0.2 C for 100 cycles and 1271 mAh g-1at 1 C for 300 cycles. Hopefully, this study can provide a foundation on how to use different metal ions to manipulate the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathode in Na-S batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.2c01836
Efficient Control of the Shuttle Effect in Sodium-Sulfur Batteries with Functionalized Nanoporous Graphenes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries (RT-NaSBs) are the evolving candidates for large-scale stationary storage because of their major benefits including double-electron redox process and the natural abundance of sodium and sulfur resources. However, their practical applications have been hampered by the poor cycling stability due to the shuttle effect. This work aims at understanding the role of heteroatom-functionalized nanoporous graphene (NPG) in preventing the shuttle effect. The density functional theory method was used to unravel important properties associated with polysulfide-NPG interactions, including binding energy, electronic density of states, charge transfer mechanism, and dissociative energy barriers of the polysulfides. The findings reveal that oxygen- and nitrogen-functionalized NPG can effectively present the shuttle effect by chemically binding to sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn) with a binding energy stronger than that between Na2Snand the common electrolyte solvents. The chemical adsorption of Na2Snon the functionalized NPG causes a semiconductor-to-metal transition, benefiting the electrical conductivity. Moreover, the functionalized NPG lowers the Na2S dissociation energy to substantially form NaS and Na, which serves as a catalyst for enhancing the redox reactions between Na and S.",ACS Applied Nano Materials,10.1021/acsanm.2c02405
Covalent encapsulation of sulfur in a graphene/N-doped carbon host for enhanced sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Application of emerging room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery is restrained by the poor conductivity, volume expansion of sulfur cathode and the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides in electrolytes. Herein, an N-doped two-dimensional (2D) carbon host was derived from the polydopamine coated graphene for sulfur storage. Different from the conventional used melt-diffusion method to integrate sulfur on graphene layer physically, we employed a vapor-infiltration method to realize the homogenous incorporation of sulfur in the graphene-based host via C-Sx-C bond. A polydopamine-derived N-doped carbon layer was further coated on graphene to confine the high-temperature-induced gas-phase sulfur, which effectively increase the covalently bonded sulfur content in the host. Moreover, based on Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurement, the C-S bonds are mainly formed beside N-doped carbon, being well explained by the stronger interaction between N-doped carbon and S4 (sulfur vapor) than that of pure carbon from density functional theory (DFT) calculation results. When tested as a cathode for RT Na-S battery, the obtained N-doped graphene/sulfur cathode shows superior cycle stability.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.136257
Polydopamine as an interfacial layer to enhance mechanical and adhesive properties of the active materials in a sulfur cathode of sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Author(s)Room temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries are promising devices for energy storage system, but for practical applications volume expansion and detrimental shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode should be solved. Herein, we introduced a novel sulfur cathode system of using polydopamine (PDA) as an interlayer in between sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) active material and pullulan-graft-sodium polyacrylic acid (PuA) binder. Active NH and OH functional groups of PDA interlayer serve as facile hydrogen bonding (H bonding) and/or chemical reaction sites to various functional groups of SPAN and PuA, thus forming an intimately packed SPAN/PDA/PuA composite with sufficient mechanical and interfacial adhesive strengths to survive from the dimensional variation of sulfur cathode during charge/discharge cycling. Moreover, various functional groups of the SPAN/PDA/PuA are capable of absorbing polysulfides to limit the shuttle effect. Sulfur cathode derived from SPAN/PDA/PuA exhibited a high specific capacity of 1340 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. Without the PDA interlayer, sulfur cathode derived from SPAN/PuA exhibits a much lower capacity of 790 mAh g−1. The role of PDA in promoting the stability and electrochemical performance of sulfur cathode is thus verified in this study.",Chemical Engineering Journal Advances,10.1016/j.ceja.2022.100352
Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries: Rules for Catalyst Selection and Electrode Design,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Seeking an optimal catalyst to accelerate conversion reaction kinetics of room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries is crucial for improving their electrochemical performance and promoting the practical applications. Herein, theoretical calculations of interfacial interactions of catalysts and polysulfides in terms of the surface adsorption state, interfacial ions migration, and electronic concentration around the Fermi level are systematically proposed as guiding principles of catalyst selection for RT Na–S batteries. As a case, MoN catalyst is accurately selected from transition metal nitrides with different d orbital electrons, and for experiment, it is introduced into the carbon nanofibers as a dual-functioning host (MoN@CNFs). The MoN@CNFs can effectively anchor polysulfides and accelerate their conversion reaction. In addition, for the sodium anode, the MoN@CNFs can also induce uniform deposition of Na and inhibit dendrite growth, which are supported by in situ characterizations and finite element simulation technique. As a result, the as-prepared RT Na–S battery displays high reversible capacity of 990 mAh g–1 at 0.2 A g–1 after 100 cycles and long lifespan over 1500 cycles at 2 A g–1. Even with high S loading of 5 mg cm–2, the RT Na–S battery still exhibits a high areal capacity of 2.5 mAh cm–2.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202204214
Stable Cycling of Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries Based on an In Situ Crosslinked Gel Polymer Electrolyte,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.High-temperature sodium-sulfur battery (HT Na–S) technology has attracted substantial interest in the stationary energy storage sector due to its low cost and high energy density. However, the currently used solid electrolyte (ß-alumina) is expensive and can only be operated at high temperatures, which compromises safety. On the other hand, liquid electrolytes in room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries (RT Na–S) are susceptible to dendrite formation and polysulfide shuttle. Consequently, an electrolyte with both solid (shuttle blocking) and liquid (ionic conductivity) properties to overcome the above-mentioned issues is highly desired. Herein, a high-performance quasi-solid state crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) prepared in situ using pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA) exhibiting high ionic conductivity of 2.33 mS cm−1 at 25 °C is presented. The GPE-based electrolyte shows high stability resulting in a high discharge capacity of >600 mAh gs−1 after 2500 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.91%. Density functional theory calculations reveal a weak interaction between the Na+ ions and the oxygen molecules of the PETA moiety, which leads to a facile cation movement. The crosslinked polymer network is tightly connected to the cathode and can confine sulfides, thereby facilitating the conversion process.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202201191
Rational Electrolyte Design toward Cyclability Remedy for Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Rechargeable room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries are a promising energy storage technology, owing to the merits of high energy density and low cost. However, their electrochemical performance has been severely hindered by the poor compatibility between the existing electrolytes and the electrodes. Here, we demonstrate that an all-fluorinated electrolyte, containing 2,2,2-trifluoro-N,N-dimethylacetamide (FDMA) solvent, 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether (MTFE) anti-solvent and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive, can greatly enhance the reversibility and cyclability of RT Na–S batteries. A NaF- and Na3N-rich cathode electrolyte interphase derived from FDMA and FEC enables a “quasi-solid-phase” Na–S conversion, eliminating the shuttle of polysulfides. The MTFE not only reduces polysulfide dissolution, but also further stabilizes the Na anode via a tailored solvation structure. The as-developed RT Na–S batteries deliver a high capacity, long lifespan, and enhanced safety.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202205416

Inhibited shuttle effect by functional separator for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022According to a statistic, approximately 6 trillion cigarettes are smoked each year all over the world, which produces approximately 1.2 million tons of discarded cigarette butts. The discarded cigarette filters are non-biodegradable, thus they produce a mass of waste disposal and cause environmental pollution issue. For the purpose of transforming waste into wealth and reducing environmental pollution, nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon nanofiber/carbon black (N,S-CNF/CB) composite derived from the discarded cigarette filters is employed to modify glass fiber (GF) separator for the first time in this study. N,S-CNF improves binding ability towards sodium polysulfides (SPSs) by chemisorption. Non-polar CB limits the dissolution of SPSs in the liquid electrolyte by physisorption. The experiment and density functional theory calculation results indicate that a RT-Na/S battery with a N,S-CNF/CB+GF separator exhibits good cycling stability and rate performance. After 100 cycles at a low current rate of 0.1 C, a RT-Na/S battery with a sulfur mass fraction of 71% delivers a discharge capacity of 703 mAh g − 1.

Streamline Sulfur Redox Reactions to Achieve Efficient Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.It is vital to dynamically regulate S activity to achieve efficient and stable room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT/Na−S) batteries.

The rationally constructed CoS2 electron reservoir enables the straight reduction of S to short-chain sodium polysulfides (Na2S4) via a streamlined redox path through electron transfer. Meanwhile, cobalt single atoms synergistically work with the electron reservoir to reinforce the streamlined redox path, which immobilize in situ formed long-chain products and catalyze their conversion, thus realizing high S utilization and sustainable cycling stability.

Trends in the Development of Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.This review examines research reported in the past decade in the field of the fabrication of batteries based on the sodium–sulfur system, capable of operating at an ambient temperature (room-temperature sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries). Such batteries differ from currently widespread lithium-ion or lithium–sulfur analogs in that their starting materials are cheaper and more readily available. One of the key problems to be resolved on the way to room-temperature Na–S batteries with high energy density and long-term cycling stability is transport of cell reaction products (sodium polysulfides) to the opposite electrode, which leads to an appreciable battery self-discharge and loss of the active material as a result of redox reactions that are not accompanied by energy generation. This review is aimed at examining approaches to improving the electrochemical performance of the room-temperature Na–S batteries. Particular attention is paid to potential applications of cation-exchange materials capable of suppressing polysulfide anion transport, with a high sodium cation transport rate retained.",Inorganic Materials,10.1134/S0020168522040124
A High-Efficiency Mo2C Electrocatalyst Promoting the Polysulfide Redox Kinetics for Na–S Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries, as promising next-generation energy storage candidates, are drawing more and more attention due to the high energy density and abundant elements reserved in the earth. However, the native downsides of RT Na-S batteries (i.e., enormous volume changes, the polysulfide shuttle, and the insulation and low reactivity of S) impede their further application. To conquer these challenges, hierarchical porous hollow carbon polyhedrons embedded with uniform Mo2C nanoparticles are designed deliberately as the host for S. The micro- and mesoporous hollow carbon indeed dramatically enhances the reactivity of the S cathodes and accommodates the volume changes. Meanwhile, the highly conductive dispersed Mo2C has a strong chemical adsorption to polysulfides and catalyzes the transformation of polysulfides, which can effectively inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides and accelerate the reaction kinetics. Thus, the as-prepared S cathode can display a high reversible capacity (1098 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 120 cycles) and superior rate performance (483 mAh g−1 at 10.0 A g−1).

Tungsten Nanoparticles Accelerate Polysulfides Conversion: A Viable Route toward Stable Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries are arousing great interest in recent years. Their practical applications, however, are hindered by several intrinsic problems, such as the sluggish kinetic, shuttle effect, and the incomplete conversion of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs). Here a sulfur host material that is based on tungsten nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene is reported. The incorporation of tungsten nanoparticles significantly accelerates the polysulfides conversion (especially the reduction of Na2S4 to Na2S, which contributes to 75% of the full capacity) and completely suppresses the shuttle effect, en route to a fully reversible reaction of NaPSs. With a host weight ratio of only 9.1% (about 3–6 times lower than that in recent reports), the cathode shows unprecedented electrochemical performances even at high sulfur mass loadings. The experimental findings, which are corroborated by the first-principles calculations, highlight the so far unexplored role of tungsten nanoparticles in sulfur hosts, thus pointing to a viable route toward stable Na–S batteries at room temperatures.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.202105544

"V2O3-decorated carbon nanofibers as a robust interlayer for long-lived, high-performance, room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.We developed a V2O3 nanoparticle–decorated carbon nanofiber (V2O3@CNF) interlayer for room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries (RT/NaSBs), inserted on the cathode side of the separator to inhibit the shuttling of sodium polysulfides, i.e., their migration to the sodium anode, and thus realize high-performance RT/NaSBs. The V2O3 adsorbs polysulfides and catalytically promotes polysulfide trapping, while the CNFs provide conductive channels that facilitate ion transport and accelerate reaction kinetics. The electrochemical performance of the resulting Na–S cells are superior to those of cells with a CNF interlayer and without an interlayer. A cell with a V2O3@CNF interlayer utilizes almost 70% of its active material at 0.1C, while cells with a CNF interlayer and without an interlayer utilize 54 and 33%, respectively. It demonstrates superior rate performance, achieving a capacity of 268 mA h g−1 at 2.0C, and its diffusion coefficient (∼10−11cm2 s−1) is an order of magnitude higher than those of cells with a CNF interlayer or without an interlayer (∼10−12 cm2 s−1), indicating fast reaction kinetics. Moreover, it delivers a discharge capacity of 406 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1.0C with a high coulombic efficiency of 100%. Even at a high C-rate of 2.0C, the capacity of the cell decays at a low rate of 0.076% per cycle over 1000 cycles, indicating exceptional capacity retention. The outstanding electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the effective sodium polysulfide confinement, improved active material utilization, and accelerated reaction kinetics associated with the V2O3@CNF interlayer.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.134205
Stable Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries in Ether-Based Electrolytes Enabled by the Fluoroethylene Carbonate Additive,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Because of its high energy density and low cost, the room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery is a promising candidate to power the next-generation large-scale energy storage system. However, its practical utilization is hampered by the short life span owing to the severe shuttle effect, which originates from the ""solid-liquid-solid""reaction mechanism of the sulfur cathode. In this work, fluoroethylene carbonate is proposed as an additive, and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether is used as the base solvent. For the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode, a robust F-containing cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) forms on the cathode surface during the initial discharging. The CEI prohibits the dissolution and diffusion of the soluble intermediate products, realizing a ""solid-solid""reaction process. The RT Na-S cell exhibits a stable cycling performance: a capacity of 587 mA h g-1 is retained after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c21059
Two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3C2T: X ) MXenes to inhibit the shuttle effect in sodium sulfur batteries,"© the Owner Societies.Room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries (RT-NSBs) are among the promising candidates for large-scale energy storage applications because of the natural abundance of the electrode materials and impressive energy density. However, one of the main technical challenges of RT-NSBs is the shuttle effect by which active redox intermediates (i.e., sodium polysulfides Na2Sn, n = 1-8) are dissolved in electrolytes, which hamper the battery reversibility. The interfacial interplays between Na2Sn and the electrodes (or electrolytes) at the atomic level thus play an intrinsic role in elucidating the shuttle effect. This work reports the ab initio calculations to unravel the suppression of the shuttle effect using titanium carbide MXenes (Ti3C2Tx, Tx = F, O) as the cathode additives. The findings reveal that the shuttle phenomenon is efficiently resolved because the immense chemical bonding of Na2Sn-Ti3C2Tx interfaces competitively surpasses the binding magnitudes of Na2Sn-electrolyte interaction. The analysis of the electronic density of states and charge density further manifests that there is charge donation from the Na-3s orbital of Na2Sn to the unfilled F(O)-2p orbitals of metallic Ti3C2Tx. The metallicity of the Ti3C2Tx remains preserved during the entire course of the redox process, ensuring the rapid electrochemical kinetics. Furthermore, the presence of Ti3C2Tx additives drastically reduces the dissociation barrier of the final redox product Na2S, yielding the efficient utilization of sulfur during the discharge process. This work has proposed the unexplored functionality of Ti3C2Tx as the anchoring materials for RT-NSBs.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/d1cp05300k
Continuous Carbon Channels Enable Full Na-Ion Accessibility for Superior Room-Temperature Na–S Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHPorous carbon has been widely used as an efficient host to encapsulate highly active molecular sulfur (S) in Li–S and Na–S batteries. However, for these sub-nanosized pores, it is a challenge to provide fully accessible sodium ions with unobstructed channels during cycling, particularly for high sulfur content. It is well recognized that solid interphase with full coverage over the designed architectures plays critical roles in promoting rapid charge transfer and stable conversion reactions in batteries, whereas constructing a high-ionic-conductivity solid interphase in the pores is very difficult. Herein, unique continuous carbonaceous pores are tailored, which can serve as multifunctional channels to encapsulate highly active S and provide fully accessible pathways for sodium ions. Solid sodium sulfide interphase layers are also realized in the channels, showing high Na-ion conductivity toward stabilizing the redox kinetics of the S cathode during charge/discharge processes. This systematically designed carbon-hosted sulfur cathode delivers superior cycling performance (420 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 2000 cycles), high capacity retention of ≈90% over 500 cycles at current density of 0.5 A g−1, and outstanding rate capability (470 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1) for room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202108363
Sulfurized Carbon Composite with Unprecedentedly High Tap Density for Sodium Storage,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHA novel sulfurized carbon decorated by terephthalic acid (TPA) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN), with unprecedently high tap density (≈1.02 g cm−3), is investigated. Room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries offer high energy density; however, the dissolution of the polysulfide is a major factor hindering their commercialization. This dissolution problem can be tolerated by inhibiting the formation of polysulfide through binding sulfur to the carbon structure of PAN. Low sulfur content and low volumetric energy density in the composite are other drawbacks to be resolved. Heat-treated TPA induces a high-density carbonaceous material with high conductivity. This TPA is partly replaced by PAN, and the produced carbon and sulfur are composited with dehydrated polyacrylonitrile (CS–DPAN), which exhibits higher conductivity and surface area than the sulfurized dehydrated polyacrylonitrile (S–DPAN). The CS–DPAN composite electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, and the resulting volumetric capacity is also superior to that of the S–DPAN material electrode. Operando Raman and operando X-ray diffraction analyses confirm that the increased capacity is realized via the avoidance of parasitic C60Na3 formation formed below 1 V, by adjusting the operation voltage range. This finding demonstrates the feasibility of carbon–sulfur composites as a high-energy electrode material for rechargeable sodium batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202102836
Regulating the Deposition of Insoluble Sulfur Species for Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021, Jilin University, The Editorial Department of Chemical Research in Chinese Universities and Springer-Verlag GmbH.Room temperature sodium-sulfur(RT-Na-S) batteries are regarded as promising candidates for next-generation high-energy-density batteries. However, in addition to the severe shuttle effect, the inhomogeneous deposition of the insoluble sulfur species generated during the discharge/charge processes also contributes to the rapid capacity fade of RT-Na-S batteries. In this work, the deposition behavior of the insoluble sulfur species in the traditional slurry-coated sulfur cathodes is investigated using microporous carbon spheres as model sulfur host materials. To achieve uniform deposition of insoluble sulfur species, a self-supporting sulfur cathode fabricated by assembling microporous carbon spheres is designed. With homogeneous sulfur distribution and favorable electron transport pathway, the self-supporting cathode delivers remarkably enhanced rate capability(509 mA·h/g at 2.5 C, 1 C=1675 mA·h/g), cycling stability(718 mA·h/g after 480 cycles at 0.5 C) and areal capacity(4.98 mA·h/cm2 at 0.1 C), highlighting the great potential of manipulating insoluble sulfur species to fabricate high-performance RT-Na-S batteries.",Chemical Research in Chinese Universities,10.1007/s40242-021-1273-5
Sulfur encapsulation into yolk-shell Fe2N@nitrogen doped carbon for ambient-temperature sodium-sulfur battery cathode,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na-S) battery represents an advanced energy storage technology because of low cost and large theoretical energy density. However, RT-Na-S battery technology is facing severe challenges such as dissolution of sodium polysulfide, loss of active material on the surface of anode, serious shuttle effect and poor cycle stability. Herein, we synthesis hollow polar iron nitride nanoparticle encased N-doped carbon yolk shell (YS-Fe2N@NC) as sulfur carrier. The synergistic effect of YS-Fe2N@NC as well as wide void can be effectively trap polysulfides and improve the conductivity of sulfur-based cathode. The reversible reaction mechanism of Na-S battery is studied by in/ex-situ characterizations, catalytic behaviour of YS-Fe2N@NC and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The as made S/YS-Fe2N@NC composite exhibit promising specific capacity of 1123 mAh g−1 at the rate of 1C for the initial cycle, good rate capability (845 mAh g−1 at 2C) and ultra-stable cycling performance with an ultra-low capacity decay of 0.0724% per cycle.

In situ implanting MnO nanoparticles into carbon nanorod-assembled microspheres enables performance-enhanced room-temperature Na-S batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The accomplishment of high-performance room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries necessitates multifunctional sulfur electrodes via decent materials design strategies, since they are suffering from a series of critical challenges in S conversion chemistry. Herein, a functionalized S cathode is fabricated through in situ implanting polar MnO nanoparticles into carbon microspheres self-assembled by porous nanorods. The one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanorods can assist in fast electron transfer while nanochannels among the well-aligned nanorods act as pathways for Na ion diffusion. More significantly, the embedded ultrafine polar MnO nanoparticles function as good polysulfide adsorbents due to their strong chemical affinity and can promote conversion kinetics. As such, RT Na-S batteries with the as-designed S cathode achieve great cyclability of 234 mA h g−1 over 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1 and superior rate capability of 418 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers,10.1039/d2qi01362b
Cellulose nanofiber-derived carbon aerogel for advanced room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT/Na–S) batteries are regarded as promising large-scale stationary energy storage systems owing to their high energy density and low cost as well as the earth-abundant reserves of sodium and sulfur. However, the diffusion of polysulfides and sluggish kinetics of conversion reactions are still major challenges for their application. Herein, we developed a powerful and functional separator to inhibit the shuttle effect by coating a lightweight three-dimensional cellulose nanofiber-derived carbon aerogel on a glass fiber separator (denoted NSCA@GF). The hierarchical porous structures, favorable electronic conductivity, and three-dimensional interconnected network of N,S-codoped carbon aerogel endow a multifunctional separator with strong polysulfide anchoring capability and fast reaction kinetics of polysulfide conversion, which can act as the barrier layer and an expanded current collector to increase sulfur utilization. Moreover, the hetero-doped N/S sites are believed to strengthen polysulfide anchoring capability via chemisorption and accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion, which is confirmed from experimental and theoretical results. As a result, the assembled Na–S coin cells with the NSCA@GF separator showed a high reversible capacity (788.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C after 100 cycles) and superior cycling stability (only 0.059% capacity decay per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C), thereby demonstrating the significant potential for application in high-performance RT/Na–S batteries.",Carbon Energy,10.1002/cey2.203
Potassium hydroxide activated carbon derived from albumen as an efficient sulfur host for room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021The room temperature sodium–sulfur (RT/NaS) battery provides a potential energy storage technology with high theoretical capacity and low cost.

KOH activation plays a vital role in enhancing conductivity, surface area, and porosity. Elemental sulfur was loaded to the ECK through simple heat evaporation to form an ECK@S composite. Even at the high rate of 1 C, the discharge capacity of the ECK@S electrode reached 473 mAh/g and maintained 202 mAh/g after 800 cycles, representing an outstanding performance.

An Efficient Strategy toward Multichambered Carbon Nanoboxes with Multiple Spatial Confinement for Advanced Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Intricate hollow carbon structures possess vital function for anchoring polysulfides and enhancing the utilization of sulfur in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. However, their synthesis is extremely challenging due to the complex structure. Here, a facile and efficient strategy is developed for the controllable synthesis of N/O-doped multichambered carbon nanoboxes (MCCBs) by selective etching and stepwise carbonization of ZIF-8 nanocubes. The MCCBs consist of porous carbon shells on the outside and connected carbon grids with a hollow structure on the inside, bringing about a MCCBs structure. As a sulfur host, the multichambered structure has better spatial encapsulation and integrated conductivity via the inner interconnected carbon grids, which combines the characteristics of short charge transfer path and superb physicochemical adsorption along with mechanical strength. As expected, the S@MCCBs cathode realizes decent cycle stability (0.045% capacity decay per cycle over 800 cycles at 5 A g-1) and enhanced rate performance (328 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1). Furthermore, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation confirms the good structural stability of the S@MCCBs during the (de)sodiation process.

Sulfurized Cyclopentadienyl Nanocomposites for Shuttle-Free Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyA major challenge hindering the practical adoption of room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries (NaSBs) is polysulfide dissolution and shuttling, which results in irreversible capacity decay and low Coulombic efficiencies. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time NaSBs using a ferrocene-derived amorphous sulfurized cyclopentadienyl composite (SCC) cathode. Polysulfide dissolution is eliminated via covalent bonding between the insoluble short-chain sulfur species and carbon backbone. Control experiments with a metal-free composite analogue determined that the iron species in the SCC does not have a significant role in polysulfide anchoring. Instead, the superior electrochemical performance is attributed to sulfur covalently bonded to carbon and the uniform nanoparticulate morphology of the SCC composite. In the carbonate-based electrolyte, a discharge capacity of 795 mAh g(S)–1 was achieved during early cycling at 0.2 C, and high Coulombic efficiencies close to 100% were maintained with capacity retention of 532 and 442 mAh g(S)–1 after 100 and 200 cycles, respectively.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c04182

Heavily Tungsten-Doped Sodium Thioantimonate Solid-State Electrolytes with Exceptionally Low Activation Energy for Ionic Diffusion,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHA strategy for modifying the structure of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) to reduce the cation diffusion activation energy is presented. Two heavily W-doped sodium thioantimonate SSEs, Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 and Na2.7W0.3Sb0.7S4 are designed, both exhibiting exceptionally low activation energy and enhanced room temperature (RT) ionic conductivity; 0.09 eV, 24.2 mS/cm and 0.12 eV, 14.5 mS/cm. At −15 °C the Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 displays a total ionic conductivity of 5.5 mS/cm. The 30 % W content goes far beyond the 10–12 % reported in the prior studies, and results in novel pseudo-cubic or orthorhombic structures. Calculations reveal that these properties result from a combination of multiple diffusion mechanisms, including vacancy defects, strongly correlated modes and excessive Na-ions.

Understanding Sulfur Redox Mechanisms in Different Electrolytes for Room-Temperature Na–S Batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s).Abstract: This work reports influence of two different electrolytes, carbonate ester and ether electrolytes, on the sulfur redox reactions in room-temperature Na–S batteries. Two sulfur cathodes with different S loading ratio and status are investigated. A sulfur-rich composite with most sulfur dispersed on the surface of a carbon host can realize a high loading ratio (72% S). In contrast, a confined sulfur sample can encapsulate S into the pores of the carbon host with a low loading ratio (44% S). In carbonate ester electrolyte, only the sulfur trapped in porous structures is active via ‘solid–solid’ behavior during cycling. The S cathode with high surface sulfur shows poor reversible capacity because of the severe side reactions between the surface polysulfides and the carbonate ester solvents. To improve the capacity of the sulfur-rich cathode, ether electrolyte with NaNO3 additive is explored to realize a ‘solid–liquid’ sulfur redox process and confine the shuttle effect of the dissolved polysulfides. As a result, the sulfur-rich cathode achieved high reversible capacity (483 mAh g−1), corresponding to a specific energy of 362 Wh kg−1 after 200 cycles, shedding light on the use of ether electrolyte for high-loading sulfur cathode.

"Sub-zero and room-temperature sodium–sulfur battery cell operations: A rational current collector, catalyst and sulphur-host design and study","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Minimizing polysulfide-shuttling while using a high-sulfur loaded cathode is vital in the effort to realize practical room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries. Because of their inexpensive, highly abundant materials, these batteries have great potential as future, low-cost, stationary energy storage devices. The sluggish kinetics associated with the electrochemical conversion of electrolyte-soluble Na-polysulfides into insoluble final products causes a rapid accumulation of the intermediates in the electrolyte that escalates the polysulfide-shuttling. We report indium tin oxide nanoparticles decorated onto activated carbon cloth (ITO@ACC) as an electrocatalytic substrate that immobilizes the higher-order Na-polysulfides and also promotes their conversion into the insoluble end-discharge products and thus suppresses the accumulation of intermediate products in the electrolyte. The conversion into the insoluble end-discharge product is confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to be via a free-radical coupling mechanism. At 20 °C, the ITO@ACC-catalyzed sodium-sulfur batteries (6.8 mg(S) cm–2) gave an early cycle capacity of 684 mA h g(S)–1 and after 1000 cycles the capacity was maintained at 445 mA h g(S)–1 at a 0.5C rate.

Mo2N–W2N Heterostructures Embedded in Spherical Carbon Superstructure as Highly Efficient Polysulfide Electrocatalysts for Stable Room-Temperature Na–S Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries are highly desirable for a sustainable large-scale energy-storage system due to their high energy density and low cost. Nevertheless, practical applications of RT Na–S batteries are still prevented by the shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides (NaPS), slow reaction kinetics of S, and incomplete conversion process of NaPS.

The designed Mo2N–W2N@PC heterostructure with abundant heterointerfaces, high conductivity, and porosity can facilitate electron/ion diffusion and provide high catalytic activity for efficient NaPS conversion. The obtained Na–S battery delivers high reversible capacity with superior long-term cyclability (517 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 400 cycles) and unprecedented rate capability (417 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1). Furthermore, the electrocatalysis mechanism is revealed by combining in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV–vis spectra, and precipitation experiments. This work demonstrates a novel heterostructure design strategy that enables high-performance Na–S batteries.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202103846
Manipulating the Electronic Structure of Nickel via Alloying with Iron: Toward High-Kinetics Sulfur Cathode for Na-S Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.The sluggish conversion kinetics and severe shuttle effect in room-temperature Na-S (RT Na-S) batteries cause knotty issues, such as poor rate performance, fast capacity decay as well as low Coulombic efficiency, which seriously impede their practical application. Therefore, exploiting cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for absorbing soluble long-chain sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) and expediting NaPSs conversion is of paramount importance. Herein, catalyst mining is first conducted by density functional theory calculations, which reveal that the alloying of Fe into Ni can tailor the electronic structure, leading to lower reaction energy barrier for polysulfide conversion. Based on this, FeNi3@hollow porous carbon spheres (FeNi3@HC) as a promising sulfur host for RT Na-S batteries are rationally designed and fabricated. As expected, the S@FeNi3@HC cathode exhibits an excellent cycling stability (591 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 2 A g-1) and outstanding rate performance (383 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1). Our work demonstrates an effective strategy (i.e., alloying strategy with a rich electron state) to design superior electrocatalysts for RT Na-S batteries.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.1c05778
Designing dual-defending system based on catalytic and kinetic iron Pyrite@C hybrid fibers for long-life room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The poor conductivity and severe polysulfide dissolution greatly restrict the development of room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries. To address these issues, a dual-polysulfide-defending system based on catalytic and kinetic hybrid fibers is designed to realize high-performance and long-life for RT-Na/S batteries. The hollow carbon fibers filled with yolk-shell FeS2/C hollow nanocubes (FeS2-YSB@BIT) are constructed as the flexible sulfur host. The highly conductive and porous network ensures fast electron/ion transports and facilitates high mass loading. More impressively, the polar FeS2 boxes ensure the strong chemical binding and high catalytic redox reaction on polysulfides, which produce the first defense on polysulfide shuttle. Meanwhile, the FeS2@C/carbon nanotubes (CNT) hybrid film works as the modifying layer on the separator, which builds the second defense to ion shuttle. Taken the advantages of both dual-polysulfide-defending system and the hierarchical polar electrode, the RT-Na/S battery achieves superior high-rate capability, long-term cycling stability and high energy storages. It obtains an ultralow capacity decay rate (0.024%) during 1000 cycles at the rate of 2C with a high mass loading of 7.6 mg cm−2. Therefore, this work not only designs a freestanding kinetic and catalytic host for sulfur electrodes, but also provides a new design on RT-Na/S batteries to realize long life, superior rate capability and high energy storage synchronously.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.129681
Flower-Like Interlayer-Expanded MoS2−x Nanosheets Confined in Hollow Carbon Spheres with High-Efficiency Electrocatalysis Sites for Advanced Sodium–Sulfur Battery,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT-Na/S) battery is one of the most promising technologies for low-cost energy storage. However, application of RT-Na/S batteries is currently impeded by severe shuttle effects and volume expansion that limits both energy density and cycling stability. Herein, first, the first-principal calculation is used to find that the introduction of sulfur vacancies in MoS2 can effectively enhance polysulfide adsorption and catalytic ability as well as both the ion and electron conductivities. Then, unique MoS2−x/C composite spheres are further designed and synthesized with flower-like few-layer and interlayer-enlarged MoS2−x nanosheets space-confined in hollow carbon nanospheres by a “ship-in-a-bottle” strategy. With this novel design, the mass loading of S in the MoS2−x/C composite can be reached to as high as 75 wt%. Owing to the synergetic effect of interlayer-expanded and few-layer MoS2−x nanosheets and hollow carbon spheres matrix with high electronic/Na+ conductivity, the RT-Na/S batteries deliver highly stable cycle durability (capacity retention of 85.2% after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1) and remarkable rate capability (415.7 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1) along with high energy density. This design strategy of defect- and interlayer-engineering may find wide applications in synthesizing electrode materials for high-performance RT-Na/S batteries.",Small,10.1002/smll.202101879
Multi-channel sulfurized polyacrylonitrile with hollow structure as cathode for room temperature sodium–sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) has been comprehensively studied as a promising electrode material for sodium–sulfur batteries. However, problems such as low capacity and poor cycle stability still exist in room temperature sodium–sulfur batteries (RT-Na/S batteries). Here, a multi-channel sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (MSPAN) with hollow structure prepared by electrospinning technology was combined with polystyrene (PS) acting as a pore-forming agent, which not only provided a larger specific surface area and enlarged contact between electrode and electrolyte, but also limited the shuttling of polysulfides effectively, thereby improving the reversible specific capacity and rate performance of the electrodes. Through comparing the electrochemical performances of MSPAN on different current collectors, it was found that copper foil as the current collector favored the electrochemical performances of the materials. As a result, the MSPAN-2 used as the cathode for RT-Na/S batteries exhibited a high discharge specific capacity of 314.2 mAh g−1 at a current density of 2 ​A ​g−1. The fabrication of MSPAN provides a good example for improving the electrochemical performance of RT-Na/S batteries.",Journal of Solid State Chemistry,10.1016/j.jssc.2021.122359
Atomically dispersed S-Fe-N4 for fast kinetics sodium-sulfur batteries via a dual function mechanism,"© 2021 The AuthorsRoom-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries have significant potential for large-scale applications due to the low cost and high energy density of both sulfur and sodium. Nevertheless, the insulating nature of sulfur and the shuttle effect are impeding their practical application. Here we report that dispersed single-atom Fe sites anchored on a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix present an atomic-level strategy for the development of sulfur hosts. The electronic structure of sulfur is modified by the atomically dispersed Fe-N4 sites, which can transfer the electron to sulfur, thereby enhancing its reactivity. The S@Fe1-NMC cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 1,650 mAh g−1 initially and 540 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 100 mA g−1. A dual function mechanism is observed on S-Fe-N4 sites, which can activate the polysulfides by weakening the S-S bonds and accelerate Na+ diffusion into Na-poor regions to engender a high driving force for Na2Sx decomposition, thus inhibiting the shuttle effect.",Cell Reports Physical Science,10.1016/j.xcrp.2021.100531
Electrochemical release of catalysts in nanoreactors for solid sulfur redox reactions in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 The Author(s)Electrocatalysis-assisted entrapment of polysulfide while ensuring efficient nucleation of Na2S holds the key to addressing the shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics of polysulfide in room-temperature (RT) Na/S batteries. The constrained active sites, however, dramatically limit the efficiency of electrocatalysts. Here, a strategy of electrochemically releasing nano-silver catalytic sites during the discharge process is presented, visualized, and implemented for accelerated Na2S nucleation. Because of the effective polysulfide immobilization and accelerated Na2S nucleation, the sulfur cathode, supported by a self-released silver electrocatalyst, exhibits a superior reversible capacity of 701 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and an ultra-stable cycling performance. Precise understanding of the electrochemically self-releasing mechanism and the catalysis in Na2S nucleation via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) would aid, however, in fundamentally optimizing the working mechanism and for further development of more stable high-power RT Na/S batteries.",Cell Reports Physical Science,10.1016/j.xcrp.2021.100539
Mechanistic Insights into Interactions of Polysulfides at VS2Interfaces in Na-S Batteries: A DFT Study,"© Room temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries, because of their high theoretical energy density and low cost, are considered as a promising candidate for next-generation energy storage devices. However, the practical utilization of the Na-S batteries is greatly hindered by various deleterious factors such as dissolution of sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn) into the electrolyte commonly termed as ""shuttle effect,""sluggish decomposition of solid Na2S, and poor electronic conductivity of sulfur. To overcome the challenges, we introduced single-layer vanadium disulfide (VS2) as an anchoring material (AM) to immobilize higher-order polysulfides from the dissolution and also to accelerate the otherwise sluggish kinetics of insoluble short-chain polysulfides. We employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the Na2Sn interactions at the VS2 interfaces. We show that the adsorption strengths of various Na2Sn species on the VS2 basal plane are adequate (1.21-4.3 eV) to suppress the shuttle effect, and the structure of Na2Sn are maintained without any decomposition, which is necessary to mitigate capacity fading. The calculated projected density of states (PDOS) reveals that the metallic character of the pristine VS2 is retained even after Na2Sn adsorption. The calculated Gibbs free energy of each elementary sulfur reduction reaction indicates a significant decrement in the free energy barrier due to the catalytic activity of the VS2 surface. Furthermore, VS2 is found to be an excellent catalyst to significantly reduce the oxidative decomposition barrier of Na2S, which facilitates accelerated electrode kinetics and higher utilization of sulfur. Overall, VS2 with strong adsorption behavior, enhanced electronic conductivity, and improved oxidative decomposition kinetics of polysulfides can be considered as an effective AM to prevent the shuttle effect and to improve the performance of Na-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c10868

However, the shutting effect of polysulfides and sluggish kinetics of sulfur redox reactions still severely limit their practical implementation. Herein, a new type of 3D hierarchical porous carbonaceous nanocubes is reported as efficient sulfur hosts, composed of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and Co nanoparticles (NPs) uniformly embedded into a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (NC). Because of the high specific surface area, large degree of graphitization, and the synergetic effects between Co NPs and N-doping, the as-designed CNTs/Co@NC electrodes not only significantly increase polysulfides immobilization, but also efficiently catalyze sulfur redox reactions, as confirmed by experimental results and DFT calculations. When tested in a RT Na–S battery, the S@CNTs/Co@NC-0.25 cathode demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance, achieving high initial specific capacity of 1200.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, remarkable rate capability up to 5.0 C (474.2 mAh g−1), and superior cyclic performance of 450.5 mAh g−1 (292 mAh g−1) after 400 cycles at 1.0 C (5.0 C).

Architecting Freestanding Sulfur Cathodes for Superior Room-Temperature Na–S Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHRoom-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries have attracted extensive attention because of their low cost and high specific energy. RT Na–S batteries, however, usually suffer from sluggish reaction kinetics, low reversible capacity, and short lifespans. Herein, it is shown that chain-mail catalysts, consisting of porous nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) encapsulating Co nanoparticles (Co@PCNFs), can activate sulfur via electron engineering. The chain-mail catalysts Co@PCNFs with a micrograde hierarchical structure as a freestanding sulfur cathode (Co@PCNFs/S) can provide space for high mass loading of sulfur and polysulfides. The electrons can rapidly transfer from chain-mail catalysts to sulfur and polysulfides during discharge–charge processes, therefore boosting its conversion kinetics. As a result, this freestanding Co@PCNFs/S cathode achieves a high sulfur loading of 2.1 ± 0.2 mg cm−2, delivering a high reversible capacity of 398 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C (1 C = 1675 mA g−1) over 600 cycles and superior rate capability of an average capacity of 240 mA h g−1 at 5 C. Experimental results, combined with density functional theory calculations, demonstrate that the Co@PCNFs/S can efficiently improve the conversion kinetics between the polysulfides and Na2S via transferring electrons from Co to them, thereby realizing efficient sulfur redox reactions.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202102280
A novel one-step reaction sodium-sulfur battery with high areal sulfur loading on hierarchical porous carbon fiber,"© 2020 The Authors. Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdRoom temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries are gaining extensive attention as attractive alternatives for large-scale energy storage, due to low cost and high abundancy of sodium and sulfur in nature. However, the dilemmas regarding soluble polysulfides (Na2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) and the inferior reaction kinetics limit their practical application. To address these issues, we report the activated porous carbon fibers (APCF) with small sulfur molecules (S2–4) confined in ultramicropores, to achieve a reversible single-step reaction in RT Na-S batteries. The mechanism is investigated by the in situ UV/vis spectroscopy, which demonstrates Na2S is the only product during the whole discharge process. Moreover, the hierarchical carbon structure can enhance areal sulfur loading without sacrificing the capacity due to thorough contact between electrolyte and sulfur electrode. As a consequence, the APCF electrode with 38 wt% sulfur (APCF-38S) delivers a high initial reversible specific capacity of 1412 mAh g−1 and 10.6 mAh cm−2 (avg. areal sulfur loading: 7.5 mg cm−2) at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g−1), revealing high degree of sulfur utilization. This study provides a new strategy for the development of high areal capacity RT Na-S batteries.",Carbon Energy,10.1002/cey2.86
Hydrothermal synthesis of MoS2/rGO composite as sulfur hosts for room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries and its electrochemical properties,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries are an attraction to worldwide industrial and academic as a next-generation energy storage system due to the high energy density, theoretical capacity, and cheap cost of sulfur.

Tunable Nitrogen-Doping of Sulfur Host Nanostructures for Stable and Shuttle-Free Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries have potential in stationary applications, but challenges such as loss of active sulfur and low electrical conductivity must be solved. Nitrogen-doped nanocarbon host cathodes have been employed in metal-sulfur batteries: polar interactions mitigate the loss of sulfur, while the conductive nanostructure addresses the low conductivity. Nevertheless, these two properties run contrary to each other as greater nitrogen-doping of nanocarbon hosts is associated with lower conductivity. Herein, we investigate the polarity-conductivity dilemma to determine which of these properties have the stronger influence on cycling performance. Lower carbonization temperatures produce more pyridinic nitrogen and pyrrolic nitrogen, which from density functional theory calculations preferentially bind discharge products (Na2S and short-chain polysulfides). Despite its lower conductivity, the highly doped composite showed better Coulombic efficiency and stability, retaining a high capacity of 980 mAh g(S)-1 after 800 cycles. Our findings represent a paradigm shift where nitrogen-doping should be prioritized in designing shuttle-free, long-life sodium-sulfur batteries.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c01763
Yolk@Shell Structured MnS@Nitrogen-Doped Carbon as a Sulfur Host and Polysulfide Conversion Booster for Lithium/Sodium Sulfur Batteries,"© Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been regarded as an important candidate for next-generation energy storage devices due to their low cost and high theoretical energy density. However, several factors retard the practical use of Li-S batteries including the slow kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) transformation as well as the shuttle effect induced by the diffusion of LiPS that damages the cycling stability of Li-S batteries. In this study, a yolk@shell structured MnS@nitrogen-doped carbon (MnS@N-C) is developed as the S host and polysulfide conversion booster, which offers both the physical confinement of S species and accelerated kinetics toward LiPS catalytic conversion. As a result, the developed S/yolk@shell MnS@N-C delivers a higher rate performance compared to S/yolk@shell MnO@N-C and S/N-C and long cycle life with a remaining capacity of 636.1 mAh g-1 after 330 cycles at 0.5C. When equipped with MnS@N-C functional separators, S/yolk@shell MnS@N-C retains a capacity of 504.2 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1C.

Sulfur in Amorphous Silica for an Advanced Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Battery,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe room-temperature (RT) Na/S battery is a promising energy storage system owing to suitable operating temperature, high theoretical energy density, and low cost. However, it has a poor cycle life and low reversible capacity. In this work, we report a long-life RT-Na/S battery with amorphous porous silica as a sulfur host. The sulfur is loaded into amorphous silica by a dipping method; the optimal sulfur loading is up to 73.48 wt %. Molecular dynamics simulation and first-principles calculations suggest that the complex pores, acting as micro-containers and the formation of Na-O chemical bonds between amorphous silica and sodium polysulfide, give the electrodes a strong ability to inhibit sodium polysulfide shuttle. This would give rise to effectively avoiding the loss of active sulfur, corresponding to a superior capacity and an excellent cyclability even at 10 A gsulfur−1 (nearly 100 % coulomb efficiency and high reversible capacity of 955.8 mAh gsulfur−1 after 1460 cycles).",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202015932
MOF-Derived CoS2/N-Doped Carbon Composite to Induce Short-Chain Sulfur Molecule Generation for Enhanced Sodium-Sulfur Battery Performance,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Dissolution of intermediate sodium polysulfides (Na2Sx; 4≤x≤8) is a crucial obstacle for the development of room-temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries. One promising strategy to avoid this issue is to load short-chain sulfur (S2-4), which could prohibit the generation of soluble polysulfides during the sodiation process. Herein, unlike in the previous reported cases where short-chain sulfur was stored by confinement within a small-pore-size (≤0.5 nm) carbon host, we report a new strategy to generate short-chain sulfur in larger pores (>0.5 nm) by the synergistic catalytic effect of CoS2 and appropriate pore size. Based on density functional theory calculations, we predict that CoS2 can serve as a catalyst to weaken the S-S bond in the S8 ring structure, facilitating the formation of short-chain sulfur molecules. By experimentally tuning the pore size of the CoS2-based hosts and comparing their performances as cathodes in Na-S and Li-S batteries, we conclude that such a catalytic effect depends on the proximity of sulfur to CoS2. This avoids the generation of soluble polysulfides and results in superior electrochemical properties of the composite materials introduced here for Na-S batteries. As a result, the optimized CoS2/N-doped carbon/S electrode showed excellent electrochemical performance with high reversible specific capacities of 488 mA h g-1 (962 mA h g(s)-1) after 100 cycles (0.1 A g-1) and 403 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles (1 A g-1) with a superior rate performance (262 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1).",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c02301
Tunable Electrocatalytic Behavior of Sodiated MoS2 Active Sites toward Efficient Sulfur Redox Reactions in Room-Temperature Na–S Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHRoom-temperature (RT) sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries hold great promise for large-scale energy storage due to the advantages of high energy density, low cost, and resource abundance. The research progress on RT Na–S batteries, however, has been greatly hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions. Herein, an elaborate multifunctional architecture, consisting of N-doped carbon skeletons and tunable MoS2 sulfiphilic sites, is fabricated via a simple one-pot reaction followed by in situ sulfurization. Beyond the physical confinement and chemical binding of polarized N-doped carbonaceous microflowers, the MoS2 active sites play a key role in catalyzing polysulfide redox reactions, especially the conversion from long-chain Na2Sn (4 ≤ n ≤ 8) to short-chain Na2S2 and Na2S. Significantly, the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 can be tunable via adjusting the discharge depth. It is remarkable that the sodiated MoS2 exhibits much stronger binding energy and electrocatalytic behavior compared to MoS2 sites, effectively enhancing the formation of the final Na2S product. Consequently, the S cathode achieves superior electrochemical performance in RT Na–S batteries, delivering a high capacity of 774.2 mAh g−1 after 800 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, and an ultrahigh capacity retention with a capacity decay rate of only 0.0055% per cycle over 2800 cycles.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202100229
High-Capacity and Stable Sodium-Sulfur Battery Enabled by Confined Electrocatalytic Polysulfides Full Conversion,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe efficient polysulfide capture and reversible sulfur recovery during reverse charging process are critical to exploiting the full potential of room temperature Na-S batteries. Here, based on a core-shell design strategy, the structural and chemical synergistic manipulation of sodium polysulfides quasi-solid-state reversible conversion is proposed. The sulfur is encapsulated in the multi-pores of 3D interconnected carbon fiber as the core structure. The Fe(CN)64−-doped polypyrrole film serves as a redox-active polar shell to lock up polysulfides and promote complete polysulfide conversion. Importantly, the short-chain Na2S4 polysulfides are reduced to Na2S directly leaving with a small fraction of soluble intermediates as the cation-transfer medium at the core/shell interface, and freeing up formation of solid Na2S2 incomplete product. Further, the redox mediator with open Fe species electrocatalytically lowers the Na2S oxidation energy barrier and renders the high reversibility of electrodeposited Na2S. The tunable quasi-solid-state reversible sulfur conversion under versatile polymer sheath greatly enhances sulfur utilization, affording a remarkable capacity of 1071 mAh g−1 and a stable high capacity of 700 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 200 cycles. The confined electrocatalytic effect provides a strategy for tuning electrochemical pathway of sulfur species and guarantees high-efficiency sulfur electrochemistry.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202100666
Enabling a Stable Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Battery Cathode by Building Heterostructures in Multichannel Carbon Fibers,"© Roomerature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries are widely considered as one of the alternative energy-storage systems with low cost and high energy density. However, the both poor cycle stability and capacity are two critical issues arising from low conversion kinetics and sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) dissolution for sulfur cathodes during the charge/discharge process. Herein, we report a highly stable RT Na-S battery cathode via building heterostructures in multichannel carbon fibers. The TiN-TiO2@MCCFs, fabricated by electrospinning and nitriding techniques, are loaded with the active material S, forming S/TiN-TiO2@MCCFs as the cathode in a RT Na-S battery. At 0.1 A g-1, the cathode produces the capacity of more than 640 mAh g-1 within 100 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. Even at 5 A g-1, the battery still exhibites a capacity of 257.1 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles. Combining structural and electrochemical analyses with the first-principles calculations reveals that the incorporation of the highly electrocatalytic activity of TiN with the powerful chemisorption of TiO2 well stabilizes S and also alleviates the shuttle effects of polysulfides. This work with simple processes and low cost is expected to promote the further development and application of metal-S batteries.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.1c00804
Multi-step Controllable Catalysis Method for the Defense of Sodium Polysulfide Dissolution in Room-Temperature Na-S Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature (RT) sodium-sulfur batteries hold great promise for the development of efficient, low-cost, and environmentally friendly energy storage systems. Nevertheless, the dissolution of long-chain polysulfides is a huge obstacle. In this work, a composite cathode which integrates Ni/Co bimetal nanoparticles as the catalyst and carbon spheres with abundant channels as the host is prepared for RT Na-S batteries. Moreover, a valuable strategy to reduce the dissolution of polysulfides by accurately regulating the two-step reaction kinetics of polysulfide transformation (from Na2S to long-chain polysulfides and then from polysulfides to sulfur) is presented. Through adjusting the ratio of Ni and Co, the optimal cathode with a Ni/Co ratio of 1:2 can retard the first conversion of Na2S to polysulfides and simultaneously accelerate the subsequent transformation of polysulfides to sulfur. In this case, the soluble polysulfides can immediately transform to solid sulfur as soon as it appears, thus avoiding the shuttle of polysulfides. The galvanostatic intermittent titration method and in situ Raman are employed to supervise the transformation of polysulfides during the discharge/charge process. As a result, the composite shows excellent performance as the cathode of RT liquid/quasi-solid-state Na-S batteries in terms of specific capacities, rate capability, and cycle stability.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c21267
Single-Atom Catalysts for Improved Cathode Performance in Na-S Batteries: A Density Functional Theory (DFT) Study,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The room-temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries have attracted remarkable attention because of their promise to deliver high-capacity and low-cost earth-abundant sodium and sulfur. However, the practical development of Na-S batteries is hindered due to multiple challenges, including rapid capacity fading stems from the dissolution of intermediate sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn) and slow kinetics of electrochemical conversion reactions. In this study, we introduced novel transition-metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) to impede the dissolution of higher-order Na2Sn and improve otherwise sluggish kinetics of short-chain polysulfides. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to elucidate the detailed interactions of the polysulfides on the SACs. The pristine and nitrogen-doped graphenes are also considered and found to provide ineffective anchoring for trapping polysulfides. However, the SACs embedded via monodispersed transition-metal atoms in NG (TM-NG where TM = Cr, Fe, and Co) exhibit adequate binding strength toward Na2Sn species. The calculated adsorption energies of soluble Na2Sn on SACs are superior compared to that of commonly used ether-type electrolyte solvents; thus, the SACs are predicted to serve as effective immobilizers for soluble Na2Sn to prevent shuttling. The enhanced binding strength for TM-doped substrates arises from the strong TM-S covalent interactions. The density of state (DOS) calculations reveal that both the pristine and polysulfide adsorbed TM-NG exhibits metallic behavior and illustrate the mechanisms of stronger polysulfide interactions originated from the hybridization of TM-3d and S-2p orbitals. Furthermore, the electron-deficient SACs are found to substantially reduce the Na2S decomposition barrier, which demonstrates effective electrocatalysis in favor of complete reversible conversion of polysulfides. Overall, the effectiveness of the SACs on preventing shuttle effect and improving the kinetics of electrocatalytic conversion of polysulfides unraveled in this study will lead to a paradigm shift in developing advanced Na-S batteries with highly efficient electrocatalysts for Na2Sn conversion.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c00467

However, the widespread application of RT-Na/S batteries is severely hindered by the dissolution, shuttling, and sluggish kinetics conversion of sodium polysulfides (SPSs) during electrochemical processes. Herein, we prepare a powerful functional separator to suppress the shuttle effect by directly coating 2H-MoSe2/nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres/graphene oxide (2H-MoSe2/N-HCS/GO) onto a standard glass fiber separator. The rational design of the functional separator effectively suppresses the migration of SPSs and promotes the conversion reactions of SPSs. Meanwhile, N-HCS decorated with few-layer 2H-MoSe2nanoflakes is used as the sulfur host. As verified by a series of density functional theory calculations and experimental characterization, a RT-Na/S battery with a functional separator and a high sulfur content of 71.4 wt% delivers a high discharge capacity of 787 mA h g−1at 0.1C after 100 cycles and exhibits outstanding long-term cycling stability (484 mA h g−1at 0.5C after 500 cycles), with a low capacity fading rate of 0.077% per cycle.

Sodium-Sulfur Batteries Enabled by a Protected Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Solid Electrolyte,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Sodium-sulfur batteries are promising energy-dense, cost-effective energy storage systems. However, a low-resistance solid electrolyte is necessary to stabilize the sodium anode. While sulfide-based solid electrolytes offer high ionic conductivity, they suffer from chemical reactivity when in contact with sodium metal and are mechanically brittle. This paper implements an in situ cross-linking reaction to embed sodium-ion-conducting sodium thioantimonate in a protective polymer host. The enhanced flexibility enables the formation of a thin but transferable hybrid electrolyte film (30 μm in thickness, 65 ohm cm2 room temperature resistance). Owing to the chemical bonding between sodium thioantimonate and the polymer, the hybrid electrolyte maintains a stable interface with sodium when cycling at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2. The hybrid solid electrolyte protects the sodium metal from corroding with polysulfide-containing liquid electrolyte and enables the stable operation of a sodium-sulfur battery using a nonencapsulated sulfur cathode for 90 cycles.",ACS Energy Letters,10.1021/acsenergylett.0c02494
Macro-microporous carbon with a three-dimensional channel skeleton derived from waste sunflower seed shells for sustainable room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Macro-microporous carbon (MMC), with a three-dimensional channel skeleton and co-doping of heteroatoms derived from waste sunflower seed shells, was synthesized through a facile chemical-activation process. The three-dimensional channel skeleton with a macroporous structure of the MMC formed an interwoven carbon network that effectively improved the electrical conductivity and facilitated the transfer of Na+ in the cell by allowing the electrolyte to permeate easily. The micropores (<0.7 nm) of the MMC are the main sulfur host and serve to trap the small sulfur molecules (<0.5 nm) within the pores, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance in room-temperature sodium sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries with a carbonate-based electrolyte. The co-doping of heteroatoms (N, O) in the MMC matrix can create an active site that improves the electrical conductivity and builds an interaction with sulfur species to inhibit polysulfide shuttling. The confinement of sulfur through these physical and chemical mechanisms results in a high initial discharge capacity of 1598 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and a superior capacity retention of 330 mAh g−1 after 510 cycles at 1 C. This study provides an attractive material derived from biomass for low-cost and sustainable RT Na–S batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.157316
Solid-State Electrochemical Synthesis of Silicon Clathrates Using a Sodium-Sulfur Battery Inspired Approach,"© 2021 The Author(s). Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.Clathrates of Tetrel elements (Si, Ge, Sn) have attracted interest for their potential use in batteries and other applications. Sodium-filled silicon clathrates are conventionally synthesized through thermal decomposition of the Zintl precursor Na4Si4, but phase selectivity of the product is often difficult to achieve. Herein, we report the selective formation of the type I clathrate Na8Si46 using electrochemical oxidation at 450 °C and 550 °C. A two-electrode cell design inspired by high-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries is employed, using Na4Si4 as working electrode, Na β″-alumina solid electrolyte, and counter electrode consisting of molten Na or Sn. Galvanostatic intermittent titration is implemented to observe the oxidation characteristics and reveals a relatively constant cell potential under quasi-equilibrium conditions, indicating a two-phase reaction between Na4Si4 and Na8Si46. We further demonstrate that the product selection and morphology can be altered by tuning the reaction temperature and Na vapor pressure. Room temperature lithiation of the synthesized Na8Si46 is evaluated for the first time, showing similar electrochemical characteristics to those in the type II clathrate Na24Si136. The results show that solid-state electrochemical oxidation of Zintl phases at high temperatures can lead to opportunities for more controlled crystal growth and a deeper understanding of the formation processes of intermetallic clathrates.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1149/1945-7111/abdfe5
Approach to Increase the Utilization of Active Material in a High Sulfur-Loaded Cathode for High Areal Capacity Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Developing room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries with a high-sulfur-containing cathode and a relatively low amount of electrolyte is the prime factor for implementation of these batteries into the energy storage market. However, it is extremely challenging to achieve stable, long-term cyclability while utilizing a high-sulfur-loaded cathode, since strong adhesion of active material with the current collector should be maintained during charge-discharge. Here, we report manganese dioxide nanoarray-decorated carbon cloth conformally wrapped with sodium-alginate nanofibers (abbreviated as CC@MnO2@Na-alg) as a robust cathode current collector, which not only restricts the gradual dissolution of polysulfides but also offers good adhesion to the active material. To facilitate ion-transport kinetics, a liquid-phase Na2S6 catholyte is used as an active material. At 1C (C = 1672 mA g-1), the catholyte-infiltrated CC@MnO2@Na-alg electrode scaffold, with a high sulfur loading of 3.4 mg cm-2, exhibits a remarkable capacity retention of 94.4% after 1000 cycles. Comprehensive theoretical studies reveal the possible anchoring sites in sodium-alginate for the confinement of the polysulfide species.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c02294
Optical Microscopy Reveals the Ambient Sodium-Sulfur Discharge Mechanism,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.With growing demand for energy storage, there is renewed interest in ambient sodium-sulfur batteries, which boast raw material costs below $1/kWh owing to the natural abundance and high theoretical energy density of the pairing. As with lithium, sodium electrochemically reacts with sulfur in ether-based electrolytes, and the intermediate discharge products (polysulfides) dissolve in the battery electrolyte. These polysulfide intermediates have distinct colors, from red-brown to yellow. Additionally, when the solvent permits chemical reordering, the S3•- radical is detected with a blue hue. Radicalization hinders the electrochemical reaction by altering charge balance. Since the reaction intermediates exist with distinct colors, their evolution can be identified during electrochemical discharge with an in-situ optical cell. Optical analysis facilitates detection and characterization of intermediate products across a broader concentration range that is not accessed by more complex in-situ UV-vis spectroscopy. We demonstrate the utility of in-situ optical microscopy for comparing the ambient discharge mechanism in electrolytes from the glyme family. These chain-like solvents, from monoglyme (G1) to tetraglyme (G4), have a greater stabilizing effect on sodium electroplating than for lithium, warranting their investigation at the sulfur cathode. Both the in-situ experiment and stoichiometric solutions reveal that G1 results in the lowest polysulfide solubility and the least sulfur radicalization, while G4 has the greatest. G2 falls between them. Image analysis of the electrolyte between the sulfur working electrode and sodium counter allow for the red, green, and blue image pixilation (RGB) and image brightness to be assessed. With this analysis, we can assign the evolution of particular polysulfides to discharge voltage features.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c07180

Efficient Catalytic Conversion of Polysulfides by Biomimetic Design of “Branch-Leaf” Electrode for High-Energy Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s).Rechargeable room temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries are seriously limited by low sulfur utilization and sluggish electrochemical reaction activity of polysulfide intermediates. Herein, a 3D “branch-leaf” biomimetic design proposed for high performance Na–S batteries, where the leaves constructed from Co nanoparticles on carbon nanofibers (CNF) are fully to expose the active sites of Co. The CNF network acts as conductive “branches” to ensure adequate electron and electrolyte supply for the Co leaves. As an effective electrocatalytic battery system, the 3D “branch-leaf” conductive network with abundant active sites and voids can effectively trap polysulfides and provide plentiful electron/ions pathways for electrochemical reaction. DFT calculation reveals that the Co nanoparticles can induce the formation of a unique Co–S–Na molecular layer on the Co surface, which can enable a fast reduction reaction of the polysulfides. Therefore, the prepared “branch-leaf” CNF-L@Co/S electrode exhibits a high initial specific capacity of 1201 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and superior rate performance.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters,10.1007/s40820-020-00563-6
Dual-porosity carbon derived from waste bamboo char for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries using carbonate-based electrolyte,"© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries have recently drawn a great deal of attention owing to their low cost and high theoretical energy density, making them promising energy storage systems.

A high initial discharge capacity of 1168 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and a superior capacity retention of 320 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C over 600 cycles were obtained. The excellent electrochemical performances came from the unique porous structure and oxygen-containing functional groups of DPC.

Hierarchical porous carbon sheets for high-performance room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries: Integration of nitrogen-self-doping and space confinement,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries hold great promise for next generation high energy storage systems due to their high theoretical capacity and the low cost of both sodium and sulfur. However, the slow reaction kinetics and insulating properties of sulfur, and dissolution of sodium polysulfides seriously inhibit their practical applications. In this work, a nitrogen-self-doped porous carbon (NPC) sheet is prepared through facile self-assembly, followed by a pyrolysis/activation process, in which polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) simultaneously acts as a carbon and nitrogen source. Benefiting from the large specific surface area, abundant micro/nanoporous structure, and nitrogen-self-doping, the obtained NPC sheets can significantly boost space confinement for sulfur molecules and effectively alleviate the dissolution of sodium polysulfides during the charge-discharge process in RT Na-S batteries. As a result, the optimum sample (S@NPC-700) is used as the cathode of a RT Na-S battery, which delivers a specific capacity of 280.9 mA h g-1 (at 2.0C) and maintains a reversible capacity of 418.9 mA h g-1 at 0.5C after 400 cycles. The superior performance of the S@NPC-700 electrode can be attributed to the synergistic effect from the micro/nanoporosity of carbon sheets and nitrogen-self-doping.

"Electrochemical redox kinetic behavior of S8 and Na2Sn (n = 2, 4, 6, 8) on vulcan XC-72R carbon in a flowing-electrolyte system","© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Many studies have shown that sulfur electrodes in room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries undergo a liquid-phase electrochemical reaction. Moreover, the electrochemical redox kinetic behavior of S8 and sodium polysulfides (Na2S8, Na2S6, Na2S4, and Na2S2) is important in understanding the macroscopic kinetics of sulfur electrodes. In this study, a three-electrode electrochemical test system is built using a two-chamber micro-electrolysis cell with a flowing electrolyte and Nafion membrane. Electrochemical kinetic parameters, such as the onset redox potentials, exchange current densities, reaction orders, and apparent activation energies of the sodium polysulfides during the redox process are obtained from a steady-state polarization curve. The onset redox potentials of S8, Na2S8, Na2S6, Na2S4, and Na2S2 on Vulcan XC-72R carbon are 2.37, 2.23, 2.11, 1.99, and 1.83 V (vs. Na/Na+), respectively. Furthermore, the relationship between the discharge capacity of sodium polysulfides and their onset redox potentials is established. The aforementioned kinetic parameters are vital in elucidating the formation of discharge/charge platforms and sloping regions in an RT Na–S battery.

Lewis Acid–Base Interactions between Polysulfides and Boehmite Enables Stable Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHRoom-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries are among the ideal candidates for grid-scale energy storage due to their high theoretical energy density. However, rapid dissolution of polysulfides along with extremely slow redox kinetics lead to a low practical cell capacity and inferior cycling stability, inhibiting their practical applications. Herein, an innovative design strategy is introduced for a chemical and structural synergistic immobilization of sodium-polysulfides in the cathode structure. An aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH) nanosheets decorated sulfur/carbon black nanocomposite (S@CB@AlOOH) is used as an efficient cathode material for stable RT Na–S batteries. The cathode material exhibits extremely stable cycling performance, delivering an initial specific capacity of 392 mA h g–1 and retains 378 mA h g–1 after 500 cycles at 1C. The excellent performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the structural encapsulation as well as chemical immobilization of polysulfides, significantly suppressing their gradual dissolution into liquid electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that through favorable Lewis acid–base interactions, AlOOH catalyzes the redox conversion of the higher-order polysulfides (Na2Sn, 6 ≤ n ≤ 8) to the lower-order polysulfides (Na2Sx, 1 ≤ x ≤ 2). The importance of Lewis acid–base catalysis to enhance the overall performance of these batteries is demonstrated.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202005669
Tailoring binder-cathode interactions for long-life room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries (NaSBs) are well poised as candidates for next-generation battery applications. However, two important limitations must first be overcome: irreversible capacity loss from long-chain polysulfide dissolution and cathode pulverization from severe volume expansion. Although covalent-sulfur composites like sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (S-PAN) prevent polysulfide dissolution, they do not address the latter issue of sustaining the cathode structure during the sodiation reaction. In this work, we demonstrate that the unique interactions between polar binders and insoluble short-chain sulfur species can be exploited as a strategy to solve both challenges concurrently. Our hypothesis is that specific polar groups, like the carboxyl moiety, interact strongly with sodium sulfide and short-chain polysulfides, as compared to traditional fluoropolymer binders employed in most sulfur-based cathodes. Binder-cathode interactions were first predicted for sodium-sulfur batteries using theoretical calculations, and then confirmed experimentally using a polyacrylic acid (PAA) binder, in combination with a S-PAN cathode. This strategy can be further generalized to other carboxyl binder systems, as demonstrated using two additional binders derived from natural products. Compared to conventional polyvinylidene difluoride-based cathodes experiencing large initial capacity losses, the PAA-based S-PAN cathode delivered a long 1000 cycle lifetime with initial and final discharge capacities of 1195 and 1000 mA h g(S)-1 respectively, representing a low capacity loss of 0.016% per cycle. Rational design of NaSBs based on the synergistic interactions between insoluble sulfur species and carboxyl-binders allows us to overcome key challenges to their practical development.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d0ta07681c
An MXene-based aerogel with cobalt nanoparticles as an efficient sulfur host for room-temperature Na-S batteries,"© the Partner Organisations.High energy density room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries are receiving increasing attention as promising energy storage systems.

High performance room temperature Na-S batteries based on FCNT modified Co3C-Co nanocubes,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.High-temperature Sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries have been commercial owing to their high energy density. However, their extra safety and cost issues caused by high-temperature inhibits their wide application. Recently, room-temperature Na-S batteries have attracted widespread attention due to the low cost and excellent energy density. Nevertheless, they still suffer from the poor conductivity, sluggish redox kinetics and shuttle effect. Herein, the incorporated polar Co3C-Co with open fluorinated carbon nanotubes arrays encapsulated in porous three-dimensional (3D) framework (FCNT@Co3C-Co) was designed and applied as the sulfur host for Na-S battery. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that the polar and porous FCNT@Co3C-Co possesses the strong interactions with Na+ and S intermediate species (NaPSs), which increases the sulfide utilization and suppresses the shuttle effect by the efficient physisorption/chemisorption and rapid electrocatalytic conversion. Moreover, the synergy of the porous cube-like framework and superior interface property in FCNT@Co3C-Co mitigates the huge volume variations and reduces the energy barrier for Na-S battery. Hence, the FCNT@Co3C-Co based Na-S batteries deliver a high discharge capacity of 1364 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C even with a lean E/S of 5 mL g−1 under a high S loading of 3.2 mg cm−2 and show Coulombic efficiency above 75% after 500 loops under 2 C at room-temperature.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2020.125295

Nevertheless, the construction of such functional material is a challenge for room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries. Herein, a multiregion Janus-featured CoP-Co structure obtained via sequential carbonization-oxidation-phosphidation of heteroseed zeolitic imidazolate frameworks is introduced. The structural virtues include a heterostructure existing in a CoP-Co structure and a conductive network of N-doped porous carbon nanotube hollow cages (NCNHCs), endowing it with superior conductivity in both the short- and long-range and strong polarity toward polysulfides. Thus, the S@CoP-Co/NCNHC cathode exhibits superior electrochemical performance (448 mAh g-1 remained for 700 times cycling under 1 A g-1) and an optimized redox mechanism in polysulfides conversion. Density functional theory calculations present that the CoP-Co structure optimizes bond structure and bandwidth, whereas the pure CoP is lower than the corresponding Fermi level, which could essentially benefit the adsorptive capability and charge transfer from the CoP-Co surface to Na2Sx and therefore improve its affinity to polysulfides.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.0c03737

Meanwhile, the introduction of Fe3S4 can increase the electronic conductivity of the composite cathode by one order of magnitude and nearly double enhance the ionic conductivities. Besides, the aggregation of sulfur is effectively suppressed in the obtained Fe3S4 @ S @ 0.9Na3SbS4⋅0.1NaI composite, which will enhance the contact between sulfur and 0.9Na3SbS4⋅0.1NaI electrolyte, leading to a decreased interfacial resistance and improving the electrochemical kinetics of sulfur. Therefore, the resultant all-solid-state sodium–sulfur battery employing Fe3S4 @ S @ 0.9Na3SbS4⋅0.1NaI composite cathode shows discharge capacity of 808.7 mAh g−1 based on Fe3S4@S and a normalized discharge capacity of 1040.5 mAh g−1 for element S at 100 mA g−1 for 30 cycles at room temperature.

An artificial metal-alloy interphase for high-rate and long-life sodium–sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur battery is considered to be a promising candidate for next-generation batteries due to its high theoretical energy density (~1274 ​Wh kg−1) and natural abundance of elements. There are however, a number of concomitant challenges, including large volume change, low ionic conductivity, rapid dendrite growth, and high chemical reactivity, which limit the viability of sodium anodes. Solid electrolyte interphases that address all 4 challenges simultaneously to enable high-rate cycling of sodium anodes remain scarce in the literature. Here we report an artificial metal-alloy interphase (MAI) comprising sodium-tin alloy, which was synthesized using a facile solid-vapor reaction of metallic sodium with tin tetrachloride vapors, instead of using typical liquid electrolytes with tin-based additives (solid-liquid reaction). The MAI was found to facilitate reversible deposition of sodium at relatively high current densities (2–7 ​mA ​cm−2), and allows sodium electrodes to cycle stably for over 650 cycles at 2 ​mA ​cm−2 in sodium symmetric cells. Owing to the unique properties of MAI, such as strong electrode adhesion (to accommodate volume change), high ionic conductivity (to minimize overpotential), high Young's modulus (to suppress dendrite growth), and low electrolyte permeability (to minimize electrolyte reduction), the sodium anode with MAI can endure extended cycling test in sodium–sulfur batteries for over 500 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%.

KGaA, WeinheimRoom-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT/Na-S) batteries are considered among the most promising next-generation energy storage and conversion systems because of the earth-abundant reserves of sodium and sulfur. These batteries also possess the advantages of high theoretical gravimetric capacity, high energy density, and low cost. Herein, highly uniform Fe3+/polyacrylamide nanospheres (FPNs) are fabricated on a large-scale by a facile, low-cost approach. Subsequently, mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres (PNC-Ns), obtained by carbonizing FPNs, are applied as a sulfur matrix to improve the utilization of sulfur, enhance the overall conductivity of the cathode, and inhibit the shuttling of sodium polysulfides (SPSs). In addition, graphene and FPNs are simultaneously coated onto the side of the separator to form a FPNs-graphene-functionalized separator (FPNs-G/separator); here, the mesoporous FPNs effectively anchor and block the SPSs, while the large specific area graphene sheets eliminate the intrinsic mechanical brittleness of the FPNs and improve the overall conductivity of RT/Na-S batteries. When S/PNC-Ns as a cathode and FPNs-G/separator are assembled into an RT/Na-S battery, it delivers a high discharge capacity (639 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C after 400 cycles), stable cycle life (396 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C after 800 cycles), and good rate performance (228 mAh g-1 at 2 C).",Small,10.1002/smll.201907464
All-solid-state sodium-sulfur battery showing full capacity with activated carbon MSP20-sulfur-Na3SbS4 composite,"© 2020 The AuthorsThe need for an effective design of composite electrodes in all-solid-state Na-S batteries is warranted because of their slow charge–discharge reactions. By employing a composite of activated carbon MSP20, sulfur, and Na3SbS4 as the positive electrode material, we developed an effective all-solid-state Na-S battery that demonstrated the advantages of exhibiting a high capacity and good cyclability. Further, we discovered that filling the carbon micropores with sulfur and combining with highly conductive Na3SbS4, results in a reversible two-electron reaction between S and Na2S. This all-solid-state Na-S battery, operating at room temperature, demonstrates a high capacity of 1560 mAh per gram of sulfur (ca. 330 mAh per gram of positive electrode) and a capacity retention of 93% after 50 cycles. Decreasing the size of the S-MSP20 particles coated with Na3SbS4 in a liquid phase process was observed to reduce the volume change of the particles during charge and discharge cycles, which resulted in an excellent electrochemical performance.",Electrochemistry Communications,10.1016/j.elecom.2020.106741
Probing the Extent of Polysulfide Confinement Using a CoNi2S4Additive Inside a Sulfur Cathode of a Na/Li-Sulfur Rechargeable Battery,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.The extent of confinement of soluble metal polysulfides inside a sulfur cathode strongly determines the performance of metal-sulfur rechargeable batteries. This challenge has been largely tackled by loading sulfur inside various conducting porous scaffolds. However, this approach has not proven to be fully effective because of poor chemical interaction between the scaffold and polysulfides. Here, we demonstrate an excellent strategy of using a sulfide additive in the sulfur cathode, viz., cobalt nickel sulfide (CoNi2S4), to efficiently trap the soluble polysulfides inside the sulfur cathode. In situ Raman and ex situ UV-vis spectroscopies clearly reveal higher retention of polysulfides inside CoNi2S4/S compared to bare sulfur and carbon-sulfur mixture cathodes. Against sodium, the CoNi2S4/S assembly showed remarkable cyclability both as a function of current density (at room temperature) and temperature (at constant current density). The versatility of CoNi2S4 is further proven by the exemplary cyclability at various current densities at room temperature against lithium.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c04507
Electrocatalyzing S Cathodes via Multisulfiphilic Sites for Superior Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries hold great promise for sustainable and cost-effective applications. Nevertheless, it remains a great challenge to achieve high capacity and cycling stability due to the low activity of sulfur and the sluggish conversion kinetics between polysulfide intermediates and sodium sulfide. Herein, an electrocatalyzing S cathode is fabricated, which consists of porous core-shell structure and multisulfiphilic sites. The flexible carbon structure effectively buffers volume changes during cycling and provides enclosed spaces to store S8 with exceptional conductivity. Significantly, the multisulfiphilic sites (ZnS and CoS2) enhance catalysis toward multistep S conversion, which effectively suppresses long-chain polysulfides dissolution and improves the kinetics of short-chain polysulfides. Thus, the obtained S cathodes achieve an enhanced cycling performance (570 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 over 1000 cycles), decent rate capability (250 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 over 2000 cycles), and high energy density of 384 Wh kg-1 toward practical applications.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.0c02488
Free-Radical Catalysis and Enhancement of the Redox Kinetics for Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries offer the potential for inexpensive stationary energy storage at the grid and local level. However, their practical performance remains far from theoretical due to sluggish reaction kinetics, which limits both their energy and their rate characteristics. To overcome this, a conceptually new mechanism is demonstrated on the basis of the catalysis by stabilized free-radical species, as indicated by electron spin resonance measurements, generated on the surface of a Na2S6 catholyte-infiltrated activated carbon cloth cathode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal that free-radical catalysis promotes reduction to end-discharged products, via a surface-bound intermediate state, ACC-S3-. Due to this free-radical catalytic activity, our RT Na-S cell achieves a high nominal cell potential of 1.85 V. At a rate of 0.5 C, the Na-S cell delivers a high specific capacity of 866 mA h g(S)-1 and retains 678 mA h g(S)-1 after 700 cycles. The concept of a free-radical mechanism, as described herein, could be adapted to enhance the electrochemical kinetics of other energy storage devices that involve radical intermediate species.",ACS Energy Letters,10.1021/acsenergylett.0c00913
"Covalent Encapsulation of Sulfur in a MOF-Derived S, N-Doped Porous Carbon Host Realized via the Vapor-Infiltration Method Results in Enhanced Sodium–Sulfur Battery Performance","© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimPractical applications of room temperature sodium–sulfur batteries are still inhibited by the poor conductivity and slow reaction kinetics of sulfur, and dissolution of intermediate polysulfides in the commonly used electrolytes. To address these issues, starting from a novel 3D Zn-based metal–organic framework with 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid and 1,4-bis(pyrid-4-yl) benzene as ligands, a S, N-doped porous carbon host with 3D tubular holes for sulfur storage is fabricated. In contrast to the commonly used melt-diffusion method to confine sulfur physically, a vapor-infiltration method is utilized to achieve sulfur/carbon composite with covalent bonds, which can join electrochemical reaction without low voltage activation. A polydopamine derived N-doped carbon layer is further coated on the composite to confine the high-temperature-induced gas-phase sulfur inside the host. S and N dopants increase the polarity of the carbon host to restrict diffusion of sulfur, and its 3D porous structure provides a large storage area for sulfur. As a result, the obtained composite shows outstanding electrochemical performance with 467 mAh g−1 (1262 mAh g−1(sulfur)) at 0.1 A g−1, 270 mAh g−1 (730 mAh g−1(sulfur)) after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 and 201 mAh g−1 (543 mAh g−1(sulfur)) at 5.0 A g−1.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202000931
Ultrastable Sodium–Sulfur Batteries without Polysulfides Formation Using Slit Ultramicropore Carbon Carrier,"© 2020 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaAThe formation of the soluble polysulfides (Na2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) causes poor cycling performance for room temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries. Moreover, the formation of insoluble polysulfides (Na2Sn, 2 ≤ n < 4) can slow down the reaction kinetics and terminate the discharge reaction before it reaches the final product. In this work, coffee residue derived activated ultramicroporous coffee carbon (ACC) material loading with small sulfur molecules (S2–4) as cathode material for RT Na–S batteries is reported. The first principle calculations indicate the space confinement of the slit ultramicropores can effectively suppress the formation of polysulfides (Na2Sn, 2 ≤ n ≤ 8). Combining with in situ UV/vis spectroscopy measurements, one-step reaction RT Na–S batteries with Na2S as the only and final discharge product without polysulfides formation are demonstrated. As a result, the ultramicroporous carbon loaded with 40 wt% sulfur delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 1492 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g−1). When cycled at 1 C rate, the carbon–sulfur composite electrode exhibits almost no capacity fading after 2000 cycles with 100% coulombic efficiency, revealing excellent cycling stability and reversibility. The superb cycling stability and rate performance demonstrate ultramicropore confinement can be an effective strategy to develop high performance cathode for RT Na–S batteries.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.201903246
A Biphasic Interphase Design Enabling High Performance in Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 The Author(s)Room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries possess higher specific energy and improved inherent safety compared to their high-temperature analogs used in stationary grid storage. The viability of room temperature sodium batteries depends critically on the mechanical and ionic transport properties of the solid electrolyte interphase. However, little emphasis has been placed on developing sodium anode interphases that combine high Young's modulus (stiffness), high critical strain (ductility), and low ionic diffusion barrier for cycling at high rates. Here, we report an artificial biphasic interphase comprising two chemically distinct phases, NaOH and NaNH2, which combines high stiffness and high ductility. In addition, the biphasic interphase exhibits a low diffusion barrier for sodium ions, enabling reversible sodium plating and stripping behavior even at extremely high current densities (up to 50 mA cm−2) in symmetric cell configuration. Stable and reversible cycling of a room temperature sodium-sulfur battery is also demonstrated over 500 cycles. © 2020 The Author(s)Metal anode batteries typically lack a stable solid electrolyte interphase, causing the metal anode to grow dendrites, which eventually leads to cell failure. Kumar et al. report an artificial biphasic interphase combining high mechanical and electrochemical stability, which is found to be favorable in extending the cycle life and rate capability of sodium anodes.",Cell Reports Physical Science,10.1016/j.xcrp.2020.100044
Carbon-wrapped cobalt nanoparticles on graphene aerogel for solid-state room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery has attracted more and more widespread attention on account of the low cost, high capacity and reliable efficiency. Nevertheless, how to further improve sulfur reactivity and high-rate cycling performance remains challenging.

The novel sulfur composite cathode shows up an initial discharge capacity of 572.8 mAh g−1 at 5C with an extremely low average capacity fading of 0.01% per cycle from 200 to 1000 cycles. Significantly, the cathode is also used for assembling solid-state Na/S batteries, with an initial discharge capacity of 484.9 mAh g−1 at 0.5C and a retainion capacity of 226 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles. This outstanding performance is ascribed to the electrocatalytic effects of the nanocobalt and the conductive and flexible graphene aerogel, which can effectively enhance chemical reaction kinetics and accommodate the fast volume change.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2020.124210
Material and Interfacial Modification toward a Stable Room-Temperature Solid-State Na-S Battery,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature solid-state sodium batteries have the remarkable potential to simultaneously achieve high safety, high energy density, and low cost. However, their current performance is far below expectations. Through material and interfacial modification based on Na3PS4 solid electrolytes, progress is made toward stable room-temperature solid-state sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries. First, the ionic liquid N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Pyr14FSI) is employed to modify the anode/electrolyte interface. An overpotential of 0.55 V after 900 h of a symmetrical battery indicates enhanced interfacial stability. A stable in situ solid electrolyte interphase layer is formed at the interface of NaSn alloy and Na3PS4, proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, selenium-doped sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (Se0.05S0.95@pPAN) is used to boost the ionic and electronic conductivities of the sulfur cathode. As a result, the Na-S battery using a Se0.05S0.95@pPAN cathode and the interfacial modification delivers stable cycle performance and enhanced rate capability.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c03899
An in Situ Prepared Covalent Sulfur-Carbon Composite Electrode for High-Performance Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.A covalent sulfur-carbon (covalent-SC) composite is successfully prepared in situ by a wet-chemical solvothermal method based on the strong interaction between carbon disulfide (CS2) and red phosphorus. It is demonstrated that sulfur uniformly distributes among the boundary and interior of the carbon skeleton with the formation of S-C bonds. Moreover, the interior sulfur can be electrochemically activated under 0.5 V and then functions as a capacity sponsor, because Na+ can freely transfer into the carbon interlayer (with a stable enlarged distance of ∼0.4 nm after the first cycle) via adsorption-like behavior to be combined with the interior sulfur in the following cycles. Thus, the activated covalent-SC composite delivers ultrahigh reversible capacities of 888.9 and 811.4 mAh g-1 after 600 and 950 deep cycles at 0.8C and 1.6C, respectively. Furthermore, it exhibits outstanding rate performance with the capacity of 700 mAh g-1 at a high rate of 8.1C.",ACS Energy Letters,10.1021/acsenergylett.0c00492
Core-Shell Cathode Design with Molybdenum Trioxide as the Electrocatalytic Trapping Layer for High-Energy Density Room-Temperature Sodium Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries are receiving immense attention because of their low cost and higher energy density compared to lithium ion batteries. The key challenges of room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries are the polysulfide shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfide conversion. To mitigate these two issues, molybdenum trioxide is chosen to catalytically covert the sodium polysulfide as well as chemically anchor the polysulfide toward the cathode. This proof of concept is implemented and realized through the change in the design of the cathode wherein the sulfur is used as the core layer and MoO3 is used as the catalytic shell layer for shielding the polysulfide migration. The core-shell design of the cathode delivers a specific capacity of 1198 mA h g-1 at a current density of 50 mA g-1, which is about 4.2 times enhancement in specific capacity when compared to the single-layered cathode with a cycling stability of 1000 cycles. The core-shell cathode design offers a more stable open circuit potential for over 20 days and low charge transfer resistance. The enhancement in specific capacity is attributed to the formation of polythionate complexes through the reaction of MoO3 with the polysulfides which helps in strong binding of soluble species as evident from the spectroscopy studies. This is the first attempt of utilizing catalytic MoO3 for binding sodium polysulfide in room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries and will provide a new practical approach for the development.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b10825

Electron-State Confinement of Polysulfides for Highly Stable Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimConfinement of polysulfides in sulfur cathodes is pivotal for eliminating the “shuttle effect” in metal–sulfur batteries, which represent promising solutions for large-scale and sustainable energy storage. However, mechanistic exploration and in-depth understanding for the confinement of polysulfides remain limited. Consequently, it is a critical challenge to achieve highly stable metal–sulfur batteries. Here, based on a 2D metal–organic framework (2D MOF), a new mechanism to realize effective confinement of polysulfides is proposed. A combination of in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical computations reveal that the dynamic electron states of the Ni centers in the 2D MOF enable the interaction between polysulfides and the MOF in the discharge/charge process to be tuned, resulting in both strong adsorption and fast conversion kinetics of polysulfides. The resultant room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries are amongst the most stable reported so far, thus demonstrating that the new mechanism opens a promising avenue for the development of high-performance metal–sulfur batteries.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.201907557

This processed nanocarbon possesses a high binding affinity to sulfur and polysulfides, largely facilitating the sulfur reaction kinetics and leading to high reversible capacity. Meanwhile, by applying a thin coating of the facile-processed nanocarbon on the polymer electrolyte, dead sulfur formation can be avoided, contributing to greatly enhanced capacity retention.

PIM-1-based carbon-sulfur composites for sodium-sulfur batteries that operate without the shuttle effect,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.Room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries have distinct advantages over other next generation batteries because of their use of abundant and inexpensive resources with high theoretical capacities of 1166 and 1675 mA h g-1, namely for sodium and sulfur. However, problematic side reactions, called the shuttle effect, lead to low coulombic efficiency during cycling. Here, we propose a new strategy to fundamentally suppress the shuttle phenomenon by combining two widely used concepts, covalent bonds and physical confinement, through the preparation of a PIM-1-based carbon-sulfur composite. This sulfur-carbon material was prepared through one-step heat treatment of a mixture of sulfur and PIM-1. The resulting sulfur-carbon composites have characteristics of both ∼0.5 nm-sized ultra-micropores and covalent bonding in a single material, which fundamentally obstruct the dissolution of polysulfide into the electrolyte. This strategy led to long cycling stability over 250 cycles, with a capacity of 556 mA h gs-1 and a coulombic efficiency of approximately 100%.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta10939k

Nickel Hollow Spheres Concatenated by Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Fibers for Enhancing Electrochemical Kinetics of Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe high energy density of room temperature (RT) sodium–sulfur batteries (Na-S) usually rely on the efficient conversion of polysulfide to sodium sulfide during discharging and sulfur recovery during charging, which is the rate-determining step in the electrochemical reaction process of Na-S batteries. In this work, a 3D network (Ni-NCFs) host composed by nitrogen-doped carbon fibers (NCFs) and Ni hollow spheres is synthesized by electrospinning. In this novel design, each Ni hollow unit not only can buffer the volume fluctuation of S during cycling, but also can improve the conductivity of the cathode along the carbon fibers. Meanwhile, the result reveals that a small amount of Ni is polarized during the sulfur-loading process forming a polar NiS bond. Furthermore, combining with the nitrogen-doped carbon fibers, the Ni-NCFs composite can effectively adsorb soluble polysulfide intermediate, which further facilitates the catalysis of the Ni unit for the redox of sodium polysulfide. In addition, the in situ Raman is employed to supervise the variation of polysulfide during the charging and discharging process. As expected, the freestanding S@Ni-NCFs cathode exhibits outstanding rate capability and excellent cycle performance.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.201902617

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries have been considered to be potential candidates for future energy storage devices because of their low cost, abundance, and high performance. The sluggish sulfur reaction and the “shuttle effect” are among the main problems that hinder the commercial utilization of room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. In this study, the performance of a hybrid that was based on nitrogen (N)-doped carbon nanospheres loaded with a meagre amount of Fe ions (0.14 at.%) was investigated in the sodium-sulfur battery. The Fe ions accelerated the conversion of polysulfides and provided a stronger interaction with soluble polysulfides. The Fe-carbon nanospheres hybrid delivered a reversible capacity of 359 mAh·g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A·g−1 and retained a capacity of 180 mAh·g−1 at 1 A·g−1, after 200 cycles.

Solvent-dictated sodium sulfur redox reactions: Investigation of carbonate and ether electrolytes,"© 2020 by the authors.Sulfur-based cathode chemistries are essential for the development of high energy density alkali-ion batteries. Here, we elucidate the redox kinetics of sulfur confined on carbon nanotubes, comparing its performance in ether-based and carbonate-based electrolytes at room temperature. The solvent is found to play a key role for the electrochemical reactivity of the sulfur cathode in sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries. Ether-based electrolytes contribute to a more complete reduction of sulfur and enable a higher electrochemical reversibility. On the other hand, an irreversible solution-phase reaction is observed in carbonate solvents. This study clearly reveals the solvent-dependent Na-S reaction pathways in room temperature Na-S batteries and provides an insight into realizing their high energy potential, via electrolyte formulation design.",Energies,10.3390/en13040836
Rational construction of rGO/VO2 nanoflowers as sulfur multifunctional hosts for room temperature Na-S batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Developing high energy density room-temperature sodium sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries relies on the design of delicate structure that can be efficiently injected sulfur and enhance the cycle life of electrode active material. Herein, a three dimensional (3D) hierarchical cathode substrate with VO2 nanoflowers as catalyst in situ grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for sulfur cathodes are designed and prepared. In this novel structure, the electronic conductivity of sulfur cathode can be greatly improved due to the high electrical conductivity of rGO substrate. More importantly, the catalytic effect of VO2 accelerates the conversion long-chain NaPSs to Na2S2/Na2S, and enhances the cycle capability, which can be validated by experimental data. As a result, the as-obtained rGO/VO2/S composites achieves an initial reversible capacity of 876.4 mA h g−1 at 0.2C. Moreover, the capacity of 156.1 mA h g−1 is demonstrated after long-cycling term of 1000 cycles at 2C and high cycle stability of only 0.07% capacity decay per cycle is exhibited.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2019.122359
Repelling Polysulfides Using White Graphite Introduced Polymer Membrane as a Shielding Layer in Ambient Temperature Sodium Sulfur Battery,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimHerein, a strategy is demonstrated to effectively control the sodium polysulfide dissolution using composite polymer blend membrane. The sufficient interconnected pores in the white graphite introduced polymer blend membrane plays a multifunctional role as an ion selective membrane, evident from the ionic conductivity of 10−3 S cm−1 facilitating the movement of sodium ions and the presence of boron and nitrogen in white graphite acts as an effective absorbent to trap sodium polysulfides. The electrochemical testing reveals significant improvement of about 87.6% in specific capacity when compared to the cell without white graphite@ polymer membrane. Also, the cell exhibits an excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 83.1% at the end of 500 cycles. Other than the performance enhancement, the self-discharge battery is significantly reduced using the developed membrane. The better performance of the room temperature sodium sulfur battery is attributed to the physical and chemical confinement of composite polymer membrane which is also evident from the post analysis study. This is the first attempt of utilizing composite polymer membrane as a blocking layer in room temperature sodium sulfur batteries and is promising for the construction of high performance batteries.",Advanced Materials Interfaces,10.1002/admi.201901497
Nickel sulfide nanocrystals on nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanotubes with high-efficiency electrocatalysis for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2019, The Author(s).Polysulfide dissolution and slow electrochemical kinetics of conversion reactions lead to low utilization of sulfur cathodes that inhibits further development of room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. Here we report a multifunctional sulfur host, NiS2 nanocrystals implanted in nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanotubes, which is rationally designed to achieve high polysulfide immobilization and conversion. Attributable to the synergetic effect of physical confinement and chemical bonding, the high electronic conductivity of the matrix, closed porous structure, and polarized additives of the multifunctional sulfur host effectively immobilize polysulfides. Significantly, the electrocatalytic behaviors of the Lewis base matrix and the NiS2 component are clearly evidenced by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction and density functional theory with strong adsorption of polysulfides and high conversion of soluble polysulfides into insoluble Na2S2/Na2S. Thus, the as-obtained sulfur cathodes exhibit excellent performance in room-temperature Na/S batteries.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-019-11600-3
Highly cross-linked carbon sponge enables room-temperature long-life semi-liquid Na/polysulfide battery,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdSodium/sulfur (Na/S) batteries are actively studied due to their low cost and potential energy density. Improvements have been achieved in the room temperature Na/S batteries during the last decades, however still with low practical capacity and unstable cycling performance. We hereby report a semi-liquid Na/polysulfide (Na/PS) cell with unique microscale intertwined carbon/polymer sponges to alleviate sulfur loss during cycling. The as-prepared highly cross-linked structure not only facilitates mass transfer but provides functional reservoir to entrap polysulfides. The Na/PS batteries with low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio (∼4.05 μL/mg) retain 375 mA h/g capacity after 200 cycles. More importantly, the interlinked sponge with high sulfur loading (e.g. 1.9 mg/cm2) restricts the decay rate of open-circuit voltage to only 0.04‰ per hour, which overcomes the severe self-discharge behavior observed in many Na/S cells. The highly cross-linked sponge therefore is an efficient approach to addressing the notorious challenges of Na/PS batteries.",Materials Today Energy,10.1016/j.mtener.2019.100342
Non-flammable electrolyte for dendrite-free sodium-sulfur battery,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Room temperature (RT) sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries are a promising technology for stationary energy storage thanks to their high energy density of 1274 Wh kg−1 and low cost. However, RT Na-S batteries are hazardous because they use highly volatile and flammable electrolytes. Here, we develop a new nonflammable electrolyte for RT Na-S batteries, consisting of sodium trifluoromethanesulfonimide (NaTFSI) in a mixture of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). The nonflammable electrolyte facilitates highly stable and reversible Na plating/stripping during cycles. The dendrite-free Na-S battery with the NaTFSI/TMP+FEC electrolyte delivers a remarkable reversible capacity of 788 ​mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 1C, corresponding to a negligible capacity decay below 0.04% per cycle. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and surface analysis reveal the formation of a NaF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film with reduced interfacial resistance thanks to the introduction of FEC into the electrolyte. The formed NaF SEI layer suppresses the growth of Na dendrites on the anode, enhancing the electrochemical performance of the RT Na-S batteries. The new findings reported here will shed new light on dendrite-free RT Na-S batteries by the rational design of nonflammable electrolytes.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2019.05.045
Two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx@S as cathode for room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Room temperature sodium-sulfur battery has special research value due to the low cost of sulfur resource and its high specific capacity. However, the cathode material of the room temperature sodium-sulfur battery mainly combines carbon materials and elemental sulfur now, and the utilization of the sulfur is low. Herein, a two-dimensional layered material Ti3C2Tx was prepared. The cathode material of Ti3C2Tx@S was prepared by a simple melting method at 155 °C, and the mass percentage of the sublimed sulfur was 55%. Then, the valence states of Ti and C were characterized by XPS after loading the sublimed sulfur. The results indicated that a part of Ti3+ turned into the Ti4+, and some C–S bonds were formed. Additionally, the electrochemical properties of Ti3C2Tx@S were studied in sodium-ion battery under ambient conditions. The battery exhibited excellent rates performance, the first discharge specific capacity was 447.0 mAh g−1, and a specific capacity of 120.0 mAh g−1 was maintained at the current density of 1000 mA g−1. In addition, Ti3C2Tx@S demonstrated excellent cycle stability in room temperature sodium-sulfur battery. In the case of a current density of 100 mA g−1, the discharge specific capacity was maintained at 150.0 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles, and the capacity retention rate was 80% from the second cycle. For the electrode, the specific capacity still remained 107.7 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles.",Ionics,10.1007/s11581-019-03074-6

We report an in situ sulfur-doping strategy to functionalize MXene nanosheets by introducing heteroatomic sulfur into the MXene structure form the MAX phase precursor. By employing the vacuum freeze-drying method, a three-dimensional (3D) wrinkled MXene nanoarchitecture with the high specific surface area was prepared. The tailor-made wrinkled sulfur-doped MXene (S-Ti3C2Tx) nanosheets were applied as an electrode host material in room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. The S-Ti3C2Tx matrix shows high polarity with sodium polysulfides, restricting the diffusion of sodium polysulfides. The MXene/sulfur electrode can achieve high areal sulfur loading up to 4.5 mg cm-2 as well as good electrochemical performance (reversible capacity of 577 mAh g-1 at 2 C after 500 cycles).",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.9b04977
Designing room temperature sodium sulfur batteries with long cycle-life at pouch cell level,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The successful transfer of room temperature sodium sulfur (RT-Na-S) technology from coin cell to pouch cell level is demonstrated. The general cell design is based on a previously developed RT-Na-S concept implementing hard carbon based anodes. Scalable technologies known from lithium ion battery production are utilized for electrode production. The electrolyte composition, the voltage window as well as the balancing is evaluated on coin cell level leading to optimized parameters. For scaled electrodes and electrolytes, a specific capacity of 418 mAh gS −1 coupled with a high coulombic efficiency of 95.3% can be still obtained in RT-Na-S coin cells after a total of 549 cycles. Residual carbonates in the HC-anode were found to deteriorate the cycling performance. An increased cut-off voltage (1.5 V) significantly raises the coulombic efficiency. Finally, the design is successfully transferred to a 10-layered pouch cell leading to a high energy efficiency of 88.6% and a capacity of 387 mAh gS −1 after a total of 937 cycles.

Sodium-Sulfur Batteries with a Polymer-Coated NASICON-type Sodium-Ion Solid Electrolyte,"© 2019 Elsevier Inc.The shuttling of dissolved sodium polysulfides through conventional porous separators has been a challenging issue with the development of room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries. In this study, a NASICON-type Na+-ion solid-electrolyte membrane, Na3Zr2Si2PO12, is used as a polysulfide-shield separator. However, as a general issue with solid-electrolyte batteries, the ionic interface between the Na-metal anode and the Na-ion conduction Na3Zr2Si2PO12 membrane is fairly poor. To address this problem, a critical approach by coating a layer of a polymer that exhibits intrinsic nanoporosity (PIN) onto the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 membrane has been developed.

High-energy density room temperature sodium-sulfur battery enabled by sodium polysulfide catholyte and carbon cloth current collector decorated with MnO2 nanoarrays,"© 2018The sodium-sulfur (Na-S) battery is a well-known large-scale electrochemical storage option. The disadvantages of this particular battery technology result from its high operation temperature. Room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries would overcome these issues, but have issues of their own, such as rapid capacity decay caused by the “polysulfide shuttle” and low usage of active material resulting from the insulating nature of sulfur and the final discharge product. Here, we prepare a free-standing cathode using manganese dioxide decorated carbon cloth (CC@MnO2) as an electronically-conducting substrate and polysulfide reservoir, and sodium polysulfide (Na2S6) catholyte as the active material. Without incorporating any active interlayer, nor an expensive ion-selective membrane (such as Nafion), this free-standing cathode exhibits an initial reversible specific capacity of 938 mA h g–1 with remarkable capacity retention of 67% after 500 cycles. The as-assembled RT Na-S cell operates at an average potential of 1.82 V and delivered an initial energy density (based on the mass and molecular weight of sulfur and sodium) of 946 W h kg–1, retained an energy density of 855 W h kg–1 after 50 cycles, and attend energy density of 728 W h kg–1 after 500 cycles. Furthermore, the nature of the interactions between MnO2 and the intermediate polysulfides is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2018.11.031
Development of low-cost sodium-aqueous polysulfide hybrid batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.There has been increasing interest in sodium-sulfur (Na-S)batteries as an option for low-cost grid-scale energy storage. However, traditional Na-S batteries operate at high temperatures, raising concerns about long-term maintenance costs and safety. On the other hand, room-temperature Na-S batteries have their own limitations, including Na dendrite formation, polysulfide shuttling, and low utilization of active material. To overcome these issues, we present here a novel low-cost room-temperature sodium-aqueous polysulfide (Na-APS)hybrid battery system with a Na-metal anode, Na+-ion solid electrolyte separator, and an aqueous polysulfide catholyte. The solid electrolyte blocks Na dendrites and polysulfide shuttling while simultaneously protecting the reactive Na metal anode from the aqueous catholyte. The redox kinetics of the APS catholyte is improved with a rational development of a freestanding CuS-CNT catalytic electrode. The improvements with the Na-APS hybrid battery compared to the traditional Na-S battery systems are discussed. The Na-APS hybrid battery displays excellent performance under a 418 mA h g−1 of sulfur capacity-restricted cycling.

Silica-free sealing glass for sodium-beta alumina battery,"© 2018 The American Ceramic Society A CaO-Bi 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -B 2 O 3 glass system was studied as a sealant for sodium-sulfur battery. The thermal properties such as thermal expansion coefficient, glass transition, and softening temperature were determined by dilatometry and differential scanning calorimetry. Selected glasses, based on the thermal properties, were bonded with α-alumina substrate followed by aging in air at 400°C for 100 hours and in sodium vapor at 350°C for 100 hours. The interfacial compatibility and resistance to sodium vapor corrosion of the bonded and aged samples were evaluated by structural and microstructural analysis using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) attached with energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). Helium leakage test was performed at room temperature to examine the sealing ability of the select glass. It is found that Bi 2 O 3 increases the thermal expansion coefficient, decreases the glass transition and softening temperature, shows excellent interfacial compatibility and thermal cycling resistance, improves sealing ability, and degrades sodium corrosion resistance.",International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology,10.1111/ijac.13093
High Performance Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Battery by Eutectic Acceleration in Tellurium-Doped Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Room temperature (RT) sodium-sulfur batteries suffer from slow reaction kinetics and polysulfide dissolution, resulting in poor performance. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile is a unique sulfur cathode which is suggested to involve only S3-4 and shows high specific capacity. Herein, the designed Te0.04S0.96@pPAN with 4 mol % Te used as eutectic accelerator exhibits significantly enhanced reaction kinetics and excellent sulfur utilization, leading to a high performance RT Na-S battery.

Furthermore, UV-vis spectra and the shuttle current test reveal diminished sodium polysulfides in ether electrolyte, attributed to the fast kinetics enabled by Te doping. More significantly, the spectral technique and electrochemical analysis demonstrate a two-step reaction pathway in which Na2S3 and Na2S are the main intermediate and final discharge product, respectively.

Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery cathodes suffer from poor conductivity, rapid dissolution of intermediate products, and potentially destructive volume change during cycling. The optimal way to minimize these problems could be a construction of a nanocomposite cathode scaffold combining different components selected for their particular functions.

Strong Surface Bonding of Polysulfides by Teflonized Carbon Matrix for Enhanced Performance in Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Battery,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim The practical application of room temperature sodium-sulfur (Na–S) battery remains far away from the market due to the poor coulombic efficiency and cyclic stability which in turn arises from high dissolution of intermediate polysulfides in carbonate-based electrolytes, slow reaction kinetics, and low electrical conductivity of sulfur. In this aspect, an advanced cathode structure by incorporating Teflon-lined conductive carbon substrate (TCS) as a supporting cathode to efficiently immobilize the migration of soluble polysulfides to the anode, as well as enhance the conductivity during the polysulfide conversion, is presented here. After inclusion of TCS, the cell delivers a specific capacity of 800 mAh g −1 at 0.1C (1C = 1672 mA g −1 ) with 85% enhancement in specific capacity. Also, a stable cyclic stability of about 300 cycles with an excellent capacity retention of about 93% and coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% is obtained. Teflon, which has a linear carbon chain surrounded completely by fluorine atoms, acts as the anchoring sites for trapping the intermediate sodium polysulfides.

Controllable Chain-Length for Covalent Sulfur–Carbon Materials Enabling Stable and High-Capacity Sodium Storage,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Room temperature sodium–sulfur batteries have emerged as promising candidate for application in energy storage. However, the electrodes are usually obtained through infusing elemental sulfur into various carbon sources, and the precipitation of insoluble and irreversible sulfide species on the surface of carbon and sodium readily leads to continuous capacity degradation. Here, a novel strategy is demonstrated to prepare a covalent sulfur–carbon complex (SC-BDSA) with high covalent-sulfur concentration (40.1%) that relies on SO 3 H (Benzenedisulfonic acid, BDSA) and SO 4 2− as the sulfur source rather than elemental sulfur. Most of the sulfur is exists in the form of OS/CS bridge-bonds (short/long-chain) whose features ensure sufficient interfacial contact and maintain high ionic/electronic conductivities of the sulfur–carbon cathode. Meanwhile, the carbon mesopores resulting from the thermal-treated salt bath can confine a certain amount of sulfur and localize the diffluent polysulfides. Furthermore, the CS x C bridges can be electrochemically broken at lower potential (<0.6 V vs Na/Na + ) and then function as a capacity sponsor. And the R-SO units can anchor the initially generated S x 2− to form insoluble surface-bound intermediates. Thus SC-BDSA exhibits a specific capacity of 696 mAh g −1 at 2500 mA g −1 and excellent cycling stability for 1000 cycles with 0.035% capacity decay per cycle.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201803478

Untying thioether bond structures enabled by “voltage-scissors” for stable room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.A steady sulfur cathode is central to realizing stable room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries. Here, sulfur atoms are incorporated into carbon to form thioether bond functionalized carbon (SC) as a cathode material for sodium storage, which is capable of the complete elimination or great suppression of the shuttle effect of soluble poly-sulfides by the generation of insoluble sulfides in RT Na-S batteries using an ordinary carbonate electrolyte. This thioether bond structure (C-S-C) in sulfur-doped carbon can be disassembled by the assistance of “voltage-scissors” in the low voltage range of 0.01-0.50 V vs. Na/Na+. The small sulfur species derived from the thioether bond structure react with the sodium anode to form insoluble sulfides. Moreover, the insoluble sulfides Na2S2 and Na2S are confined in the carbon defects induced by the cleaved sulfur to prevent them from degrading the long-chain poly-sulfides. The distinctive electrochemical performance of SC enriches our understanding of the sulfur cathode, and could provide novel insights for constructing stable sulfur cathode materials for specific energy storage devices.",Nanoscale,10.1039/c9nr01637f
Fluoroethylene carbonate as an additive in a carbonates-based electrolyte for enhancing the specific capacity of room-temperature sodium-sulfur cell,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Room-temperature sodium‑sulfur (RT Na-S) battery is a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage applications due to its high theoretical specific energy, low cost, and environmental benefits. Here the effect of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as an additive in 1.0 M NaClO4-ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate (EC/PC, V/V = 1/1) electrolyte was verified in RT Na-S battery with a high-surface-area carbon/sulfur composite (YP50F/S) as the cathode. Using 1.0 M NaClO4-EC/PC electrolyte containing 5 wt% FEC, the YP50F/S electrode can deliver a reversible capacity of up to 1651 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. When 5 wt% FEC-added electrolyte is used, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the electrode surface clearly indicates a more effective solid electrolyte interface (SEI), a more thorough transformation between S and Na2S, and a more obvious redox reaction between sulfur oxides during the first discharge-charge processes. We further confirm that 5 wt% FEC can also be employed for another activated carbon material (XFP01), therefore, our work may provide a new insight for the development of RT Na-S battery.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry,10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.11.021
"A theoretical study on the stability and ionic conductivity of the Na11M2PS12 (M = Sn, Ge) superionic conductors","© 2018 Elsevier B.V.The search for next-generation solid-state superionic conductors has attracted significant attention. Among Na superionic conductors, Na11Sn2PS12 has been reported to have a room temperature ionic conductivity of 1.4 mS/cm. In this study, we employ density functional theory to study the stability of Na11Sn2PS12 and further explore the substitution of Sn with Ge. Our results indicate that Na11Ge2PS12 is more stable than Na11Sn2PS12. Furthermore, substituting Sn with Ge increases the band gap, improves the room temperature ionic conductivity by a factor of 2, and lowers the activation energy of Na hopping. Statistical analysis suggests that Na11Ge2PS12 has a faster diffusion along the ab-plane compared to the c-axis. The Na diffusion in Na11Ge2PS12 appears to occur with two different mechanisms depending on temperature: 1) an ion hopping process at lower temperatures (<800 K); 2) a fluid-like distribution of Na ions at higher temperatures (>1000 K). The computations suggest that Na11Ge2PS12 is a promising candidate as a solid Na electrolyte due to its high room temperature ionic conductivity and phase stability. In light of these simulation results, we expect to stimulate further experimental studies on Na11Ge2PS12.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.10.077
Atomic cobalt as an efficient electrocatalyst in sulfur cathodes for superior room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2018, The Author(s).The low-cost room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery system is arousing extensive interest owing to its promise for large-scale applications. Although significant efforts have been made, resolving low sulfur reaction activity and severe polysulfide dissolution remains challenging. Here, a sulfur host comprised of atomic cobalt-decorated hollow carbon nanospheres is synthesized to enhance sulfur reactivity and to electrocatalytically reduce polysulfide into the final product, sodium sulfide. The constructed sulfur cathode delivers an initial reversible capacity of 1081 mA h g−1 with 64.7% sulfur utilization rate; significantly, the cell retained a high reversible capacity of 508 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 600 cycles. An excellent rate capability is achieved with an average capacity of 220.3 mA h g−1 at the high current density of 5 A g−1. Moreover, the electrocatalytic effects of atomic cobalt are clearly evidenced by operando Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and density functional theory.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-018-06144-x
A room-temperature sodium–sulfur battery with high capacity and stable cycling performance,"© 2018, The Author(s).High-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries operating at 300–350 °C have been commercially applied for large-scale energy storage and conversion. However, the safety concerns greatly inhibit their widespread adoption. Herein, we report a room-temperature sodium–sulfur battery with high electrochemical performances and enhanced safety by employing a “cocktail optimized” electrolyte system, containing propylene carbonate and fluoroethylene carbonate as co-solvents, highly concentrated sodium salt, and indium triiodide as an additive. As verified by first-principle calculation and experimental characterization, the fluoroethylene carbonate solvent and high salt concentration not only dramatically reduce the solubility of sodium polysulfides, but also construct a robust solid-electrolyte interface on the sodium anode upon cycling. Indium triiodide as redox mediator simultaneously increases the kinetic transformation of sodium sulfide on the cathode and forms a passivating indium layer on the anode to prevent it from polysulfide corrosion. The as-developed sodium–sulfur batteries deliver high capacity and long cycling stability.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-018-06443-3
Improving the Stability of an RT-NaS Battery via In Situ Electrochemical Formation of Protective SEI on a Sulfur–Carbon Composite Cathode,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe room temperature sodium sulfur battery (RT-NaS) has attracted considerable attention as a next-generation energy storage system due to its low cost and high specific energy and the abundance of sodium and sulfur. However, the sulfur-based cathode in RT-NaS always undergoes dissolution of polysulfides during the cycle, which limits the utilization of active material and the stability of the RT-NaS. In this study, the authors report an economical and simple method to suppress the dissolution of polysulfides by forming an artificial protective solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the cathode surface using an in situ electrochemical treatment with a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) electrolyte additive. The artificially formed SEI has a thickness of ≈20 nm and contains fluoride anions that improve electrical conductivity and mechanical stability. The RT-NaS full cell with the sulfur–carbon cathode and protective SEI exhibits a 0.1 VNa+/Na lower electrochemical polarization for desodiation, and SEI and electrical resistances that are 23% and 45% lower, respectively, than those of untreated NaS. These improvements lead to a capacity increase of ≈120% (270 to 590 mAh g−1 at the 50th cycle) and a high Coloumbic efficiency of 99.5% in the high-rate cyclability test of the 2 C rate over 200 cycles.",Advanced Sustainable Systems,10.1002/adsu.201800076
Carbon hollow nanobubbles on porous carbon nanofibers: An ideal host for high-performance sodium-sulfur batteries and hydrogen storage,"© 2018One-dimensional (1D) carbon nanostructures have been intensively investigated because of their intriguing features and great potential for practical application in various fields. This paper reports the controllable fabrication of carbon hollow nanobubbles on porous carbon nanofibers (CHNBs@PCNFs) through a general electrospinning strategy, with metal azides serving as both a bubbling and a porogen reagent. The strong repulsive forces resulting from the intense release of N2 from the decomposition of metal azides upon carbonization leads to the uniform formation of porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs), which could be facile tuned by heating rates and the amount of the bubbling reagent, simultaneously constructed with carbon hollow nanobubbles (CHNBs) on the surface. Density functional theory calculations reveal the strong interactions between terminal Na atoms in sodium polysulfides and N and O atoms doped into CHNBs@PCNFs, which could effectively alleviate the shuttle effect of Na-S batteries via adsorbing and trapping polysulfides. With strong adsorption capability of sodium polysulfides and high electrical conductivity, these CHNBs@PCNFs are demonstrated to be an ideal sulfur host in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries, which delivers a high reversible capacity of 256 mA h g−1 (specific energy density 384 W h kg−1) with a low decay rate of 0.044% per cycle at 2 C-rate. When CHNBs@PCNFs used as functional supports for MgH2 nanoparticles, a significantly enhanced hydrogen storage performance was achieved. The present work represents a critically important step in advancing the electrospinning technique for generating 1D carbon nanostructures in a facile and universal manner.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2018.05.008
Remedies of capacity fading in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Liquid-electrolyte sodium-sulfur battery operated at room temperature is encountering challenges brought by the complex sulfur redox reactions, including (i) the dissolved polysulfide intermediates trigger serious side reactions on Na anode surface; (ii) the short-chain sulfide precipitation exhibits sluggish kinetics and the sulfur utilization is generally below 50% with unclear reasons. In this work, employing an ion selective polybenzimidazole-based separator we successfully suppress the polysulfide corrosion on the Na anode, which allows the investigation of the precipitation reaction. Combining DFT calculation and characterization techniques, we determine Na2S2 particles as the final discharge product and reveal that Na2S2 passivation is the predominant attributes of large polarization and capacity fading. To address these issues, we present the use of a bifunctional NaI-P2S5 based electrolyte additive, which (i) improves the Na2S2 precipitation kinetics by forming soluble Na2S2-P2S5 complex and (ii) promotes the dissolution of Na2S2 by the chemical mediation of I−/ I3−. As a result, a much improved capacity retention (92.9% for 50 cycles at 0.2C) is attained, which sheds light on enabling the stable operation of sodium-sulfur batteries via combining advanced separator and electrolyte engineering strategies.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.056
An Electrospun Nanofiber Membrane as Gel-Based Electrolyte for Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimWe report on the synthesis and characterization of an electrospun gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) membrane based on polyacrylonitrile nanofibers (PAN) swollen in a polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether/Na-salt electrolyte solution, for application in room temperature sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries. The membranes show a high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical stability window, and good thermal stability. We demonstrate the performance of the membrane in an Na–S cell using a sulfur–carbon nanotubes composite cathode and Na metal as anode. Our results show that the GPE membrane stabilizes the Na metal anode resulting in stable cycling behavior. The capacity of the Na–S cell, using the GPE membrane and operating at room temperature, is approximately 500 mAh g−1 over 40 cycles. The selected electrolyte configuration also provides improved safety by replacing the highly reactive sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) salt previously used in literature. All these benefits make the gel-polymer electrolyte membrane a very promising system for application in room-temperature sodium and sodium–sulfur batteries.",Energy Technology,10.1002/ente.201800170
Self-Assembling Hollow Carbon Nanobeads into Double-Shell Microspheres as a Hierarchical Sulfur Host for Sustainable Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.We report the use of passion fruit-like double-carbon-shell porous carbon microspheres (PCMs) as the sulfur substrate in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. The PCMs are covered by microsized carbon shells on the outside and consisted of carbon nanobeads with hollow structure inside, leading to a unique multidimensional scaling double-carbon-shell structure with high electronic conductivity and strengthened mechanical properties. Sulfur is filled inside the PCMs (PCMs-S) and protected by the unique double-carbon-shell, which means the subsequently generated intermediate sodium polysulfide species cannot be exposed to the electrolyte directly and well protected inside. In addition, the inner interconnected porous structure provides room for the volume expansion of sulfur during discharge processes. It is found that the PCMs-S with a 63.6% initial Coulombic efficiency contributed to the 290 mA h g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1 after 350 cycles. More importantly, PCMs-S exhibited good rate performance with a capacity of 113 and 56 mA h g-1 at the current densities of 1000 and 2000 mA g-1, respectively.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.8b03850

Sulfur Copolymer: A New Cathode Structure for Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.High-energy electrochemical storage containing earth abundant materials could be a choice for future battery development. Recent research reports indicated the possibility of room-temperature sodium-ion-sulfur chemistry for large storage including smart grids.

Nitrogen-Doped Graphene Nanosheets/S Composites as Cathode in Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRoom-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na−S) batteries have gained increasing attention from energy storage community in recent years. In this work, homogeneous nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets/sulfur (NGNS/S) nanocomposites, synthesized using chemical reaction-deposition method and low temperature heat treatment, were studied as active cathode materials for RT Na−S batteries. Different loading composites with 86%, 65%, 45% and 25% gamma-S8 have been electrochemically evaluated, respectively, and compared with two control electrodes of NGNS and S. It was found that the NGNS/S composite with 25% S loading exhibited the best electrochemical performance with specific capacities of 212 and 136 mAh g−1 in the 1st and 10th cycles, respectively. The enhanced electrochemical performance of NGNS/S nanocomposite is mainly attributed to the improved kinetics due to the NGNS conductive network and easier intercalation of Na+ into expanded NGNS layers due to the addition of S within the graphene layers. In addition, the composite with 25% S loading shows higher surface area and complete reaction with product of Na2S, which likely contributes to the improved energy capacity.",ChemistrySelect,10.1002/slct.201701951

Investigation of the Effect of Using Al2O3-Nafion Barrier on Room-Temperature Na-S Batteries,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries are promising battery systems because of their high theoretical capacity, high energy density, and low cost. However, their application is hindered by several issues, especially linked with the polysulfide shuttle effect. Herein, Al2O3-Nafion membrane is used to prevent migration of polysulfides from the cathode side to the anode assisting to lessen the active material loss. While Al2O3 is a very effective adsorbent to trap polysulfides anions, Nafion membrane has cation selectivity which permits migration of Na+ cations and repels polysulfide anions due to the negatively charged sulfonic groups. Thus, an increase in the performance of room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries (RT Na-S batteries) is expected by combining their constructive effects. As a result, higher capacity retention is achieved with ∼250 mAh/g capacities after 100 cycles in the presence of Al2O3-Nafion membrane in contrast to the cell without any interlayer.

This cathode design leads to an ultra-stable room temperature sodium-sulfur battery with less than 3% decay in the discharge capacity after 8000 cycles at a high current density of 4.6 A/g.

Yet, RT Na-S batteries usually suffer from low reversible capacity, short lifespan and inferior Coulombic efficiency. Herein, covalent sulfur based carbonaceous materials was investigated for RT Na-S battery to address these drawbacks. Generally, the covalent S could prevent the formation of sodium polysulfide (Na2Sn, 4≤n≤8) effectively, further avoid the dissolution of sodium polysulfide into electrolyte; besides, the covalent S in these carbonaceous materials is reversible during charge/discharge process, which is good for cycling stability. Benefiting from these merits, the covalent sulfur based materials delivers high reversible capacity over 1000 mA h g−1, long cycling stability for 900 cycles with capacity decay of 0.053% per cycle and superior Coulombic efficiency approximately 100%. This study may provide a new method for designing high performance RT Na-S batteries.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.08.056
A flexible S1-xSex@porous carbon nanofibers (x≤0.1) thin film with high performance for Li-S batteries and room-temperature Na-S batteries,"© 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.The insulating nature of sulfur and the dissolution of the reaction intermediates of polysulfides are still main challenges in rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) and room temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries, both of which cause severe capacity loss and low Columbic efficiency during cycling. In this work, by rationally design, we fabricated a flexible electrode by impregnation S1-xSex (x≤0.1) into porous carbon nanofibers (denoted as S1-xSex@PCNFs) for flexible Li-S batteries and RT Na-S batteries. The free-standing porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) film not only allows facile access of ion but also enhances the electronic conductivity of electrode and high mechanical flexibility. In addition, the micropores in PCNFs promise a sufficient S1-xSex loading and a high utilization of the active material. Furthermore, the introduction of Se in S could not only enhance the poor electronic conductivity of S but also form S-Se bonding that inhibits the shuttle phenomena of polysulfides. Such a flexible S1-xSex@PCNFs (x=0.04) electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance for both Li-S (840 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1) and Na-S batteries (762 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1), demonstrating that the diffusion of the polysulfides into the electrolyte can be greatly alleviated.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2016.05.011
A stable room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery,"High-energy rechargeable batteries based on earth-abundant materials are important for mobile and stationary storage technologies. Rechargeable sodium-sulfur batteries able to operate stably at room temperature are among the most sought-after platforms because such cells take advantage of a two-electron-redox process to achieve high storage capacity from inexpensive electrode materials. Here we report a room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery that uses a microporous carbon-sulfur composite cathode, and a liquid carbonate electrolyte containing the ionic liquid 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium-chlorate tethered to SiO2 nanoparticles. We show that these cells can cycle stably at a rate of 0.5 C (1 C=1675, mAh g-1) with 600 mAh g-1 reversible capacity and nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency. By means of spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis, we find that the particles form a sodium-ion conductive film on the anode, which stabilizes deposition of sodium. We also find that sulfur remains interred in the carbon pores and undergo solid-state electrochemical reactions with sodium ions.",Nature Communications,10.1038/ncomms11722
Hard Carbon Anodes and Novel Electrolytes for Long-Cycle-Life Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Full Cell Batteries,"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.A novel combination of hard carbon anode sodium pre-loading and a tailored electrolyte is used to prepare room temperature sodium-sulfur full cell batteries. The electrochemical loading with sodium ions is realized in a specific mixture of diethyl carbonate, ethylene carbonate, and fluoroethylene carbonate electrolyte in order to create a first solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the anode surface. Combining such anodes with a porous carbon/sulfur composite cathode results in full cells with a significantly decreased polysulfide shuttle when compared to half cells combined with metallic sodium anodes. Further optimization involves the use of Na2S/P2S5 doped tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether based electrolyte in the full cell for the formation of a second SEI, reducing polysulfide shuttle even further. More importantly, the electrochemical discharge processes in the cell are improved by adding this dissolved complexation agent to the electrolyte. As a result of this combination sodium-sulfur cells with tailored cathode materials and electrolytes can achieve high discharge capacities up to 980 mAh g-1 sulfur and 1000 cycles with 200 mAh g-1 sulfur remaining capacity, at room temperature.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.201502185
A singular flexible cathode for room temperature sodium/sulfur battery,"© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.This study introduces a new flexible cathode that contains no binder, conductive additive and current collector, but instead consists solely of a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile nanofiber (SPAN) web which is prepared by a simple pyrolysis process with low cost raw materials. This not only exhibits good electrochemical properties, but also a high flexibility, rollability, and bendability to 180° without fracture. Its feasibility as a cathode for a low cost and flexible Na/S battery is subsequently evaluated on the basis that S, PAN, and Na are cheap materials. The SPAN web delivers a high first discharge capacity of 604 mAh g-1 - electrode (1473 mAh g-1 - sulfur) at 0.01 C based on sulfur content. In cycle performance at 0.1 C, a first discharge capacity of 342 mAh g-1 - electrode is obtained and remains over 266 mAh g-1 - electrode after 200 cycles along with the coulombic efficiency near 100% from the second cycle. In terms of rate capability, it is shown to be capable of delivering a capacity of as high as 71 mAh g-1 at 1 C. The reversible electrochemical reaction of the SPAN web with Na is related to a reversible bond between the C-S and S-S bonds of the SPAN web.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.035
Performance Enhancement and Mechanistic Studies of Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries with a Carbon-Coated Functional Nafion Separator and a Na2S/Activated Carbon Nanofiber Cathode,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Operation of sodium-sulfur batteries at room temperature has been proposed and studied for about a decade, but polysulfide-shuttle through the traditional battery separator and low-utilization of the sulfur cathode commonly have been the major challenges. Also, because of the highly active nature of the sodium metal, the conventional room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery concept with the sodium-metal anode and elemental sulfur cathode imposes serious safety concerns. To overcome the above difficulties, we present here a RT Na-S system with an advanced membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) comprising a carbon-coated, presodiated Nafion membrane (Na-Nafion) and a sodium sulfide (Na2S) cathode. The Na-Nafion membrane provides a facile Na+-ion conductive path and serves as a cation-selective shield to prevent the migration of the polysulfides to the anode. The carbon coating on the Na-Nafion plays an upper-current-collector role and thereby improves the electrochemical utilization of the active Na2S. Employing Na2S as the cathode provides a pathway to develop the RT Na-S batteries with sodium-metal-free anodes. The RT Na-S battery with the above MEA exhibits remarkably enhanced capacity and cyclability in contrast to the Na-S batteries with the conventional electrolyte-separator configuration. Mechanistic studies reveal that the suppression of polysulfide migration through the Na-Nafion is due to size and electronic effects.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04588
A nitrogen doped carbonized metal-organic framework for high stability room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.A nanoporous nitrogen doped carbon matrix was prepared by carbonization of metal-organic framework zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) precursors. The doped carbon matrix was melt-infiltrated with sulfur to form a carbonized ZIF-8/S composite. The composite material exhibited good performance as the cathode for room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery (Na-S) systems. A reversible specific capacity of around 1000 mA h g-1 could be achieved at a rate of 0.1C; and a reversible specific capacity of 500 mA h g-1 was obtained at a rate of 0.2C after 250 cycles. The good performance of the Na-S battery could be attributed to the synergistic effect from the nanoporosity of the carbon matrix and the high nitrogen-doping content (ca. ∼18 at%). These attributes enhanced the entrapment of the sulfur molecules inside the carbon matrices.,Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c6ta04529d
"A room temperature Na/S battery using a β″ alumina solid electrolyte separator, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether electrolyte, and a S/C composite cathode","© 2015 Elsevier B.V.To realize a high-performance room temperature Na/S battery with an elemental sulfur cathode, it is important that sodium polysulfides stay within the cathode and that they have room enough to react freely. In this work, sodium polysulfides are confined to the cathode using a β″ alumina solid electrolyte separator and an optimal amount of tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) electrolyte. In addition, an activated carbon material, in the form of a sulfur/carbon (S/C) composite, with high surface area, porosity, and pore volume is employed in the cathode. The resulting Na/S battery shows a high first discharge capacity of 855 mAh g-1 and coulombic efficiency close to 100%, as well as stable cyclability, with a discharge capacity of 521 mAh g-1 at the 104th discharge.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.120
A highly reversible room-temperature sodium metal anode,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.Owing to its low cost and high natural abundance, sodium metal is among the most promising anode materials for energy storage technologies beyond lithium ion batteries. However, room-temperature sodium metal anodes suffer from poor reversibility during long-term plating and stripping, mainly due to formation of nonuniform solid electrolyte interphase as well as dendritic growth of sodium metal. Herein we report for the first time that a simple liquid electrolyte, sodium hexafluorophosphate in glymes (mono-, di-, and tetraglyme), can enable highly reversible and nondendritic plating-stripping of sodium metal anodes at room temperature. High average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.9% were achieved over 300 plating-stripping cycles at 0.5 mA cm-2. The long-term reversibility was found to arise from the formation of a uniform, inorganic solid electrolyte interphase made of sodium oxide and sodium fluoride, which is highly impermeable to electrolyte solvent and conducive to nondendritic growth. As a proof of concept, we also demonstrate a roomtemperature sodium-sulfur battery using this class of electrolytes, paving the way for the development of next-generation, sodium-based energy storage technologies.",ACS Central Science,10.1021/acscentsci.5b00328
Theoretical prediction of a highly conducting solid electrolyte for sodium batteries: Na10GeP2S12,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.Using first-principles simulations, we predict a high-performance solid electrolyte with composition Na10GeP2S12 for use in sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries. The thermodynamic stability of its structure is established through determination of decomposition reaction energies and phonons, while Na-ionic conductivity is obtained using ab initio molecular dynamics at elevated temperatures. Our estimate of the room-temperature (RT) conductivity is 4.7 × 10-3 S cm-1, which is slightly higher than those of other superionic solid electrolytes such as β″-alumina and Na3Zr2Si2PO12, currently used in practical high-temperature Na-S batteries. Activation energy obtained from the Arrhenius plot (in the range 800-1400 K) is 0.2 eV, which is slightly lower than the typical values exhibited by other ceramic conductors (0.25-1 V) (Hueso et al., Energy Environ. Sci., 2013, 6, 734). We show that soft Na-S phonon modes are responsible for its thermodynamic stability and the lower activation barrier for diffusion of Na-ions. Finally, the calculated electronic bandgap of 2.7 eV (a wide electrochemical window) augurs well for its safe use in sodium batteries. Opening up a possibility for realizing RT operation of Na-S batteries, our prediction of a new phase in the Na-Ge-P-S system will stimulate experimental studies of the material.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c5ta01616a

From lithium to sodium: Cell chemistry of room temperature sodium-air and sodium-sulfur batteries,"Research devoted to room temperature lithium-sulfur (Li/S8) and lithium-oxygen (Li/O2) batteries has significantly increased over the past ten years. The race to develop such cell systems is mainly motivated by the very high theoretical energy density and the abundance of sulfur and oxygen. The cell chemistry, however, is complex, and progress toward practical device development remains hampered by some fundamental key issues, which are currently being tackled by numerous approaches. Quite surprisingly, not much is known about the analogous sodium-based battery systems, although the already commercialized, high-temperature Na/S8 and Na/NiCl2 batteries suggest that a rechargeable battery based on sodium is feasible on a large scale. Moreover, the natural abundance of sodium is an attractive benefit for the development of batteries based on low cost components. This review provides a summary of the state-of-the-art knowledge on lithium-sulfur and lithium-oxygen batteries and a direct comparison with the analogous sodium systems. The general properties, major benefits and challenges, recent strategies for performance improvements and general guidelines for further development are summarized and critically discussed. In general, the substitution of lithium for sodium has a strong impact on the overall properties of the cell reaction and differences in ion transport, phase stability, electrode potential, energy density, etc. can be thus expected. Whether these differences will benefit a more reversible cell chemistry is still an open question, but some of the first reports on room temperature Na/S8 and Na/O2 cells already show some exciting differences as compared to the established Li/S8 and Li/O2 systems.",Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology,10.3762/bjnano.6.105
Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries with liquid-phase sodium polysulfide catholytes and binder-free multiwall carbon nanotube fabric electrodes,"© 2014 American Chemical Society.Charge/discharge of a room-temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) battery involves redox processes of a series of long-chain soluble sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8). By taking advantage of this, a room-temperature Na-S battery is developed with dissolved sodium polysulfide catholyte and a free-standing, binder-free multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) fabric electrode. Use of liquid-phase sodium polysulfide as a cathode not only provides a facile dispersion and homogeneous distribution of the sulfur active material into the conductive matrix but also supplies a unique approach to mechanistically understand the ambient-temperature Na-S battery system. With the intermediate products (polysulfides) as the starting cathode, the electrochemical characteristics of the Na-S battery in the lower-voltage-plateau region can be readily studied without the impact from the transformation process of elemental sulfur into long-chain sodium polysulfides. The nanostructured, free-standing MWCNT fabric electrode in this battery system acts as a high-surface current collector. In comparison with the traditional solid sulfur-carbon composite cathode, the sodium polysulfide/MWCNT fabric cathode provides higher active-material utilization and capacity retention during cycling. Electrochemical studies reveal that the transition of the low-ordered sodium polysulfides (or disulfide) is mostly responsible for the capacity fade during cycling. Operation of the cells with the sulfur/dissolved sodium polysulfide redox couple provides a stable output capacity/energy.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/jp507655u
Capacity Enhancement and Discharge Mechanisms of Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.A strategy for capacity and cyclability enhancement of room-temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries is reported by inserting a nanostructured, carbon-based interlayer between the sulfur cathode and the separator. The interlayer localizes the soluble polysulfide species and prevents its migration to the sodium anode. Electrochemical and spectroscopic characterizations along with thermodynamic analyses indicate that the charge/discharge of the Na-S cell involves complicated transition processes through a series of long-chain (Na<inf>2</inf>S<inf>n</inf>, 4≤n≤8) and short-chain (Na<inf>2</inf>S<inf>n</inf>, 1≤n<4) sodium-polysulfide intermediates.

Highly reversible room-temperature sulfur/long-chain sodium polysulfide batteries,"In a room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery, the complicated reduction reaction of the sulfur cathode generally involves two main steps: (i) transformation of elemental sulfur into long-chain soluble sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn 4 ≥ n ≥ 8) and (ii) conversion of the long-chain sodium polysulfides into solid-state short-chain polysulfide Na 2S2 or disulfide Na2S. It is found that the slow kinetics of the second step limits the efficiency of discharge and induces irreversible capacity loss during cycling. Accordingly, we present here a RT Na-S cell operated with the sulfur/long-chain sodium polysulfide redox couple to avoid the capacity fade. An advanced cathode structure has been developed by inserting a carbon nanofoam interlayer between the sulfur cathode and the separator to localize the soluble polysulfide species and prevent its migration to the anode.

Finite element analysis study on the thermomechanical stability of thermal compression bonding (TCB) joints in tubular sodium sulfur cells,"A typical large capacity sodium sulfur (NaS) battery is operated at 300-350 C with 20-50 C thermal fluctuations during its charging and discharging. In addition, for maintenance purposes, the cell experiences larger temperature changes down to the intermediate or room temperatures. Such temperature changes can cause mechanical failure of heterogeneous joints such as thermal compression bonding (TCB) joints, which is one of the most critical issues in developing NaS batteries. The present study seeks to build a computational finite element analysis (FEA) model to predict the thermomechanical responses of NaS batteries to the attack induced by the temperature changes. Specifically, the thermomechanical stress accumulation at TCB joints of a tubular cell has been explored during its booting-and-shutdown cycles. Static temperature profiles and simplified friction conditions in the cathode wall were assumed for the model. Using the developed model, the stress components that dominantly contribute the stress accumulation at the joint were identified, and the effects of TCB geometries and container material types on the thermal stress accumulation at the TCB joints were carefully examined. It turns out that the stress accumulation at the bonding interface would be critical for the failure at the TCB joints. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Synthesis of Na-β-Al2O3 nanopowders by PVP sol-gel process,"As the key material of the β-Al2O3 electrolyte of sodium sulfur battery (SSB), the properties of Na-β-Al2O3 powders play an important role in the performance of SSB. In this study, nanosized Na-β-Al2O3 powders were prepared by Sol-Gel process with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as the chelating agent. The phase formation temperature of the Na-β-Al2O3 by the PVP-based process was reduced to 900°C, which was much lower than those of conventional SSR and most chemical synthesis methods. The new method can effectively inhibit the performance decline of the Na-β-Al2O3 ceramics induced by the volatilization of Na2O at high temperature in the conventional method. The powders were characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM techniques. It was demonstrated that the phase was pure and the particles were well dispersed with diameter of 60-70 nm, which were helpful to the good performance of Na-β-Al2O3 ceramics. In addition, the conductivities of the Na-β-Al2O3 ceramics sintered by the as-prepared powders were measured by AC impedance spectroscope and the evaluation of the spectra was carried out with increasing temperature from room temperature to 350°C.

Thermodynamics and cell chemistry of room temperature sodium/sulfur cells with liquid and liquid/solid electrolyte,"The cell chemistry of sodium/sulfur cells operating at room temperature (RT-Na/S cells) is being studied electrochemically and structurally. We show by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that the cell reaction is incomplete but prove that the end members of the cell reaction (S and Na2S) form among the expected polysulfide species Na2Sx. The sulfur utilization can be improved by employing a solid electrolyte membrane (beta″-alumina) that prevents the diffusion of the soluble polysulfide species toward the sodium side. As an important finding, the Na+ conduction within the solid electrolyte phase and across the two liquid/solid interfaces results in only small overpotentials. Nevertheless the utilization of sulfur in the present RT-Na/S (475 mAh g-1) cells is lower than the theoretical value (1675 mAh g-1). One probable reason is the chemical instability of the widely used PVDF binder. Also, the thermodynamic properties of RT-Na/S cells operating at room temperature are discussed and compared with the currently much more studied RT-Li/S cells. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Development and characterizations of Bi2O3-containing glass-ceramic sealants for sodium sulfur battery,"Bi2O3-containing glass-ceramic sealants for sodium sulfur battery are developed by doping the nucleating agent TiO2.

Evolution of strategies for modern rechargeable batteries,"This Account provides perspective on the evolution of the rechargeable battery and summarizes innovations in the development of these devices. Initially, I describe the components of a conventional rechargeable battery along with the engineering parameters that define the figures of merit for a single cell. In 1967, researchers discovered fast Na+ conduction at 300 K in Na β,β′′-alumina. Since then battery technology has evolved from a strongly acidic or alkaline aqueous electrolyte with protons as the working ion to an organic liquid-carbonate electrolyte with Li + as the working ion in a Li-ion battery. The invention of the sodium-sulfur and Zebra batteries stimulated consideration of framework structures as crystalline hosts for mobile guest alkali ions, and the jump in oil prices in the early 1970s prompted researchers to consider alternative room-temperature batteries with aprotic liquid electrolytes. With the existence of Li primary cells and ongoing research on the chemistry of reversible Li intercalation into layered chalcogenides, industry invested in the production of a Li/TiS2 rechargeable cell. However, on repeated recharge, dendrites grew across the electrolyte from the anode to the cathode, leading to dangerous short-circuits in the cell in the presence of the flammable organic liquid electrolyte. Because lowering the voltage of the anode would prevent cells with layered-chalcogenide cathodes from competing with cells that had an aqueous electrolyte, researchers quickly abandoned this effort. However, once it was realized that an oxide cathode could offer a larger voltage versus lithium, researchers considered the extraction of Li from the layered LiMO2 oxides with M = Co or Ni.These oxide cathodes were fabricated in a discharged state, and battery manufacturers could not conceive of assembling a cell with a discharged cathode. Meanwhile, exploration of Li intercalation into graphite showed that reversible Li insertion into carbon occurred without dendrite formation. The SONY corporation used the LiCoO2/carbon battery to power their initial cellular telephone and launched the wireless revolution. As researchers developed 3D transition-metal hosts, manufacturers introduced spinel and olivine hosts in the Lix[Mn2]O4 and LiFe(PO4) cathodes. However, current Li-ion batteries fall short of the desired specifications for electric-powered automobiles and the storage of electrical energy generated by wind and solar power. These demands are stimulating new strategies for electrochemical cells that can safely and affordably meet those challenges. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",Accounts of Chemical Research,10.1021/ar2002705
Advanced intermediate-temperature Na-S battery,"In this study, we reported an intermediate-temperature (∼150 °C) sodium-sulfur (Na-S) battery. With a relatively low operating temperature, this novel battery could reduce the cost and safety issues associated with the conventional high-temperature (300-350 °C) Na-S battery. A dense β′′-Al2O3 solid membrane and tetraglyme were utilized as the electrolyte separator and catholyte solvent in this battery. Solubility tests indicated that a cathode mixture of Na 2S4 and S exhibited extremely high solubility in tetraglyme (e.g., >4.1 M for Na2S4 + 4 S). CV scans of Na2S4 in tetraglyme revealed two pairs of redox couples with peaks at around 2.22 and 1.75 V, corresponding to the redox reactions of polysulfide species. The discharge/charge profiles of the Na-S battery showed a slope region and a plateau, indicating multiple steps and cell reactions. In situ Raman measurements during battery operation suggested that polysulfide species were formed in the sequence of Na2S5 + S → Na2S5 + Na2S4 → Na 2S4 + Na2S2 during discharge and in a reverse order during charge. This battery showed dramatic improvement in rate capacity and cycling stability over room-temperature Na-S batteries, which makes it more attractive for renewable energy integration and other grid related applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1039/c2ee23606k
Studies on poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) based gel electrolyte nanocomposite for sodium-sulfur batteries,"Experimental investigations on a sodium ion conducting gel polymer electrolyte nanocomposite based on poly(vinylidene fluoride-co- hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP), dispersed with silica nanoparticles are reported. The gel nanocomposites have been obtained in the form of dimensionally stable, transparent and free-standing thick films. Physical characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been performed to study the structural changes and the ion-filler-polymer interactions due to the dispersion of SiO2 nanoparticles in gel electrolytes. The highest ionic conductivity of the electrolyte has been observed to be 4.1 × 10 -3 S cm- 1 at room temperature with ~ 3 wt.% of SiO 2 particles. The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity has been found to be consistent with Vogel-Tammen-Fulcher (VTF) relationship in the temperature range from 40 to 70 °C. The sodium ion conduction in the gel electrolyte film is confirmed from the cyclic voltammetry, impedance analysis and transport number measurements. The value of sodium ion transport number (tNa+) of the gel electrolyte is significantly enhanced to a maximum value of 0.52 on the 15 wt.% SiO2 dispersion. The physical and electrochemical analyses indicate the suitability of the gel electrolyte films in the sodium batteries. A prototype sodium-sulfur battery, fabricated using optimized gel electrolyte, offers the first discharge capacity of ~165 mAh g- 1 of sulfur. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Discharge reaction mechanism of room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery with tetra ethylene glycol dimethyl ether liquid electrolyte,"The first discharge curve of a sodium-sulfur cell using a tetra ethylene glycol dimethyl ether liquid electrolyte at room temperature shows two different regions: a sloping region and a plateau region of 1.66 V. The first discharge capacity is 538 mAh g-1 sulfur and then decreases with repeated charge-discharge cycling to give 240 mAh g-1 after ten cycles. Elemental sulfur of the cathode changes to sodium polysulfides Na 2S2 and Na2S3, during full discharge. The sodium polysulfides, however, do not reduce completely to elemental sulfur after full charging. In summary, the mechanism of the battery with liquid electrolyte is 2Na + nS → Na2Sn(4 > n ≥ 2) on discharge and Na2Sn(4 > n ≥ 2) → x(2Na + nS) + (1 - x)Na2Sn(5 > n > 2) on charge. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.01.109
Increasing ionic conductivity of polymer-sodium salt complex by addition of a non-ionic plastic crystal,"Ionic conductivity and other physico-chemical properties of a soft matter composite electrolyte comprising of a polymer-sodium salt complex and a non-ionic plastic crystal are discussed here. The electrolyte under discussion comprises of polyethyleneoxide (PEO)-sodium triflate (NaCF3SO 3) and succinonitrile (SN). Addition of SN to PEO-NaCF 3SO3 resulted in significant enhancement in ionic conductivity. At 50% SN concentration (with respect to weight of polymer), the polymer-plastic composite electrolyte room temperature (= 25 °C) ionic conductivity was ∼ 1.1 × 10- 4 ω- 1 cm- 1, approximately 45 times higher than PEO-NaCF3SO 3. Observations from ac-impedance spectroscopy along with X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy strongly suggest the enhancement in the composite is ionic conductivity due to enhanced ion mobility via decrease in crystallinity of PEO. The free standing composite polymer-plastic electrolytes were more compliable than PEO-NaCF3SO3 thus exhibiting no detrimental effects of succinonitrile addition on the mechanical stability of PEO-NaCF 3SO3. We propose that the exploratory PEO-NaCF 3SO3-SN system discussed here will eventually be developed as a prototype electrolyte for sodium-sulfur batteries capable of operating at ambient and sub-ambient conditions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Discharge properties of all-solid sodium-sulfur battery using poly (ethylene oxide) electrolyte,"An all-solid sodium/sulfur battery using poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) polymer electrolyte are prepared and tested at 90 °C. Each battery is composed of a solid sulfur electrode, a sodium metal electrode, and a solid PEO polymer electrolyte. During the first discharge, the battery shows plateau potentials at 2.27 and at 1.76 V. The first discharge capacity is 505 mAh g-1 sulfur at 90 °C. The capacity drastically decreases by repeated on charge-discharge cycling but remains at 166 mAh g-1 sulfur after 10 cycles. The latter value is higher than that reported for a Na/poly (vinylidene difluoride)/S battery at room temperature. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Room temperature Na/S batteries with sulfur composite cathode materials,"Sodium/sulfur (Na/S) batteries were assembled with a sodium metal anode, liquid electrolyte and a sulfur composite cathode. Their electrochemical characteristics have been investigated at room temperature. Their charge/discharge curves indicate that sodium can reversibly react with sulfur at room temperature. The specific capacity of the sulfur composite cathode material in the first cycle was initially about 655 mA h g-1 and stayed at about 500 mA h g-1 up to the 18th cycle with about 100% charge/discharge efficiency. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Low-temperature zinc-sulfur battery Niedertemperatur-zink-schwefel-batterie,"High-temperature sulfur batteries, for example the sodium-sulfur battery, are well known. However, the positive electrode based on elementary sulfur at room temperature in a metal-sulfur battery could not be constructed because sulfur is known to be an excellent insulator. Due to its low atomic weight, its low cost and its non-toxicity, sulfur would be a desirable material for batteries. We could show that elementary sulfur is an excellent cathode material at room temperature as it is reduced rapidly in aqueous solutions on the surface of iron sulfide electrodes. The open-cell voltage of a zinc-sulfur battery is about 0.6V, that of a lithium-sulfur battery about 2.5V. The capacities and specific energies exceed those of commercially available zinc-manganese dioxide batteries. In this context the electrochemical reaction of solid elementary sulfur on iron sulfide surfaces in sea water is discussed which could have been one of the energy sources which played a role in the development of life.",Monatshefte fur Chemie,10.1007/pl00010302
Schwefelradikale S3- in Natriumtetrasulfid bei erhöhter Temperatur,"Raman EPR and visible absorption spectra of sodium tetrasulfide in the solid state and melts have been studied from room temperature up to 300 °C. The above techniques provide strong evidence for breaking of the polysulfide chains resulting in the production of S3- radical ions. The existence of the radical ions in polysulfides at elevated temperatures is important for understanding the electrode processes in sodium sulfur batteries. © 1976, Walter de Gruyter.
