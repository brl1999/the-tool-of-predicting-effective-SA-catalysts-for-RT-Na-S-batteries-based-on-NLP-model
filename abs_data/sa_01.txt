Engineering unsymmetrically coordinated Cu-S1N3 single atom sites with enhanced oxygen reduction activity
Atomic interface regulation is thought to be an efficient method to adjust the performance of single atom catalysts. Herein, a practical strategy was reported to rationally design single copper atoms coordinated with both sulfur and nitrogen atoms in metal-organic framework derived hierarchically porous carbon (S-Cu-ISA/SNC). The atomic interface configuration of the copper site in S-Cu-ISA/SNC is detected to be an unsymmetrically arranged Cu-S1N3 moiety. The catalyst exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity with a half-wave potential of 0.918â€‰V vs. RHE. Additionally, through in situ X-ray absorption fine structure tests, we discover that the low-valent Cuprous-S1N3 moiety acts as an active center during the oxygen reduction process. Our discovery provides a universal scheme for the controllable synthesis and performance regulation of single metal atom catalysts toward energy applications.
