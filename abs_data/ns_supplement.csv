"Atomically Dispersed Fe-Heteroatom (N, S) Bridge Sites Anchored on Carbon Nanosheets for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction","Single Fe atom dispersed carbon nanostructures show promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities for renewable energy applications. Nevertheless, the microenvironment of the single Fe atoms needs to be further engineered to optimize the catalytic performance, which is challenging. In this work, we develop a NaCl-template pyrolysis method to fabricate single Fe atom catalysts with atomically dispersed Fe-heteroatom (N, S) bridge sites anchored on carbon nanosheets. The N and S coordinated Fe atomic sites (FeN3S) are found to induce charge redistribution, lowering the binding strength of oxygenated reaction intermediates and leading to fast reaction kinetics and good oxygen reduction activity. Our work provides an effective method to regulate the microenvironment of single-atom catalysts for optimizing electrocatalytic performance.",ACS Energy Letters,10.1021/acsenergylett.0c02484
Chemical Vapor Deposition for N/S-Doped Single Fe Site Catalysts for the Oxygen Reduction in Direct Methanol Fuel Cells,"Single metal site catalysts are the most promising candidates to replace platinum-group-metal (PGM) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet insufficient performance and scalable preparation approaches remain great challenges. Here, we report a nitrogen (N)/sulfur (S) codoped single Fe site catalyst (Fe-N/S-C) through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy. Using the cyclopentadiene-shielded Fe atom ferrocene (Fc) as the precursor, atomically dispersed single Fe sites were successfully embedded into the N, S codoped 2D carbon nanosheets. The superior catalytic activity for the ORR in alkaline media is stemmed from the N, S codoping, tuning the optimal charge distribution of Fe sites. In addition, the CVD approach could surpress the formation of iron-carbide-containing iron clusters (“FexC/Fe”), thereby leading to high surface areas and porosity. Furthermore, the Fe-N/S-C catalyst was further studied as a cathode catalyst in direct methanol fuel cells showing encouraging performance.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.0c05446
"Fabrication of N,S co-doped carbon immobilized high-density Co single atoms toward electro-oxidation of organic sulfides with water as feedstock","Development of high-density single atoms site (SAs) electrocatalysts is highly desirable due to their extraordinary catalytic performance. However, their synthesis is still challenging and their anticorrosion capacities in electrolyte (particularly in acidic electrolyte) are unsatisfying. Herein, we have constructed N,S co-doped carbon to anchor ∼ 10 wt.% Co SAs (Co-SAs/NSC) via a novel polymerization—sulfurization—pyrolysis strategy toward selective electro-oxidation of thioethers in acidic solution. The as-obtained Co SAs has a coordination geometry of Co-S2N4, exhibiting excellent electrocatalytic activity and robust stability. At a low potential of 1.40 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the conversion rate of thioethers over Co-SAs/NSC reaches 99.7% with 100% selectivity and 100% Faraday efficiency (FE) for producing sulfoxide, which is higher than the commercial Pt electrode and the reported state-of-the-art catalysts. Theoretical calculations and experiments reveal that the Co-S2N4 structure endows the outstanding electro-oxidation activity of Co SAs through significantly promoting desorption of the products. This work presents a convenient strategy to build high-performance SAs catalysts for the resourceful use of sulfur-containing pollutants.

Atomically Dispersed Co-S-N Active Sites Anchored on Hierarchically Porous Carbon for Efficient Catalytic Hydrogenation of Nitro Compounds,"It is highly desired but challenging to develop non-noble metal-based hydrogenation catalysts that can replace noble metal-based ones for selective reduction of nitro compounds into amino compounds. Herein, we reported a hierarchically porous carbon-supported N,S dual-coordinated cobalt single-atom catalyst (Co1/NSC-AT) for hydrogenation of nitro compounds. The unique coordination environment of Co centers, combined with the hierarchically porous structure of carbon supports, endows Co1/NSC-AT with an excellent catalytic performance; the hydrogenation reaction can be efficiently performed under mild conditions (35 °C, 1bar H2) with high conversion and selectivity. The theoretical calculation reveals that the N,S dual-coordinated cobalt single-atom center (Co1S1N3) in Co1/NSC-AT acts as an active site for the hydrogenation reaction. Co1S1N3 possesses a lower reaction barrier for the rate-determining step than Co1N4 and Co nanoparticles. Moreover, N,S dual-coordinated environments can tailor the electronic structures of Co single atoms, which facilitate the desorption of H from the active sites, thus promoting the hydrogenation process.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.2c01113
Engineering the Coordination Environment of Single Cobalt Atoms for Efficient Oxygen Reduction and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions,"The coordination environment of single-atom catalysts (SACs) plays a crucial role in determining the energy conversion efficiency of related electrochemical devices. Herein, the coordination environment of a series of Co-based SACs (Co1-SACs) was tuned to correlate the chemical structures of these catalysts with their electrocatalytic performance. The optimized Co1-SACs containing Co-S2N2 sites are electrocatalytically active in both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which were carried out in alkaline media. The Co1-SACs containing Co-S2N2 sites exhibit high ORR activity, with an onset potential of 0.99 V vs RHE and good stability, as well as have promising application in a zinc-oxygen battery with a high power density (260 mW cm-2) and open-circuit voltage (1.50 V), remarkable tolerance to large current density, and long-term operation. The ORR of the Co-S2N2 site is attributed to the optimized electron density of the Co atom through its cocoordination with adjacent S and N atoms. Moreover, the Co1-SACs efficiently catalyze the HER, exhibiting a low overpotential (121 mV at 20 mA cm-2), a low Tafel slope (47 mV dec-1), and long-term stability. This work also provides a facile heteroatom-doping strategy to engineer the desired coordination environments in SACs for efficient electrocatalysis.",ACS Catalysis,10.1021/acscatal.0c05577
Coordination Tunes Selectivity: Two-Electron Oxygen Reduction on High-Loading Molybdenum Single-Atom Catalysts,"Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have great potential in electrocatalysis. Their performance can be rationally optimized by tailoring the metal atoms, adjacent coordinative dopants, and metal loading. However, doing so is still a great challenge because of the limited synthesis approach and insufficient understanding of the structure–property relationships. Herein, we report a new kind of Mo SAC with a unique O,S coordination and a high metal loading over 10 wt %. The isolation and local environment was identified by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure. The SACs catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via a 2 e− pathway with a high H2O2 selectivity of over 95 % in 0.10 m KOH. The critical role of the Mo single atoms and the coordination structure was revealed by both electrochemical tests and theoretical calculations.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202003842
Atomically dispersed nickel–nitrogen–sulfur species anchored on porous carbon nanosheets for efficient water oxidation,"Developing low-cost electrocatalysts to replace precious Ir-based materials is key for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we report atomically dispersed nickel coordinated with nitrogen and sulfur species in porous carbon nanosheets as an electrocatalyst exhibiting excellent activity and durability for OER with a low overpotential of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm −2 and a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec −1 in alkaline media. Such electrocatalyst represents the best among all reported transition metal- and/or heteroatom-doped carbon electrocatalysts and is even superior to benchmark Ir/C. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the well-dispersed molecular S|NiN x species act as active sites for catalyzing OER. The atomic structure of S|NiN x centers in the carbon matrix is clearly disclosed by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy together with computational simulations. An integrated photoanode of nanocarbon on a Fe 2 O 3 nanosheet array enables highly active solar-driven oxygen production.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-019-09394-5
Atomic manganese coordinated to nitrogen and sulfur for oxygen evolution,"Lack of high-efficiency, cost-efficient, and well-stocked oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is a main challenge in large-scale implementation of electrolytic water. By regulating the electronic structure of isolated single-atom metal sites, high-performance transition-metal-based catalysts can be fabricated to greatly improve the OER performance. Herein, we demonstrate single-atom manganese coordinated to nitrogen and sulfur species in two-dimensional graphene nanosheets Mn-NSG (NSG means N- and S- codoped graphene) as an active and durable OER catalyst with a low overpotential of 296 mV in alkaline media, compared to that of the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. Theoretical calculations and experimental measurements reveal that the Mn-N3S sites in the graphene matrix are the most active sites for the OER due to modified electronic structure of the Mn site by three nitrogen and one sulfur atoms coordination, which show lower theoretical overpotential than the Mn-N4 sites and over which the O-O formation step is the rate-determining step.

"Single Fe Atom on Hierarchically Porous S, N-Codoped Nanocarbon Derived from Porphyra Enable Boosted Oxygen Catalysis for Rechargeable Zn-Air Batteries","Iron–nitrogen–carbon materials (Fe–N–C) are known for their excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. Unfortunately, they generally show a laggard oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, which results in a lethargic charging performance in rechargeable Zn–air batteries. Here porous S-doped Fe–N–C nanosheets are innovatively synthesized utilizing a scalable FeCl3-encapsulated-porphyra precursor pyrolysis strategy. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits ultrahigh ORR activity (E1/2 = 0.84 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and impressive OER performance (Ej= 10 = 1.64 V). The potential gap (ΔE = Ej= 10 − E1/2) is 0.80 V, outperforming that of most highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. Furthermore, the key role of S involved in the atomically dispersed Fe–Nx species on the enhanced ORR and OER activities is expounded for the first time by ultrasound-assisted extraction of the exclusive S source (taurine) from porphyra. Moreover, the assembled rechargeable Zn–air battery comprising this bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits higher power density (225.1 mW cm−2) and lower charging–discharging overpotential (1.00 V, 100 mA cm−2 compared to Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst). The design strategy can expand the utilization of earth-abundant biomaterial-derived catalysts, and the mechanism investigations of S doping on the structure–activity relationship can inspire the progress of other functional electrocatalysts.",Small,10.1002/smll.201900307
