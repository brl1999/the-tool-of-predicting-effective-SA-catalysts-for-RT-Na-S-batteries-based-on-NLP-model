Three-dimensional LLZO/PVDF-HFP fiber network-enhanced ultrathin composite solid electrolyte membrane for dendrite-free solid-state lithium metal batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Composite solid electrolyte (CSE) membranes for lithium metal batteries attract great attention with excellent safety and suitable flexibility. Herein, we construct a polyethylene oxide-based ultrathin CSE membrane that is enhanced by a 3D fiber network composed of Poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) fibers and Li7La3Zr2O12 particles directly fabricated on the cathode. The 3D fiber network facilitates the rapid transport and uniform deposition of Li+, and enhances the mechanical strength of the electrolyte membrane, thereby effectively inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites. Moreover, the unique preparation method reduces the interfacial impedance, and it can also greatly reduce the electrolyte thickness, which is beneficial to increasing the energy density of the battery. The lithium symmetric battery shows stable cycling over 1500 h under 0.2 mA cm−2. Li/LiFePO4 battery with the CSE membrane exhibits a high reversible capacity of 155.8 mAh·g−1 at 0.2 C for 100 cycles and the capacity retention rate is 98.0%. Furthermore, the obtained CSE membrane has a broadened electrochemical window of 4.83 V, and the reversible capacity of the Li/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 battery is 160.6 mAh·g−1 at 0.2 C for 100 cycles. These findings showed that the structure proposed here is a viable electrolyte strategy for advanced solid-state lithium metal batteries.",Journal of Membrane Science,10.1016/j.memsci.2022.121095
A room-temperature high performance all-solid-state lithium-sulfur battery enabled by a cross-linked copolymer@ceramic hybrid solid electrolyte,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe use of solid electrolytes (SEs) is a key strategy for enabling the intrinsically safe operation of batteries comprising lithium metal anodes as they suppress the growth of lithium dendrites. Among the different types of SEs, polymer-based hybrid electrolytes (HEs) are highly promising due to their synergetic properties from the constituent polymer matrix and inorganic filler particles. However, the lithium-ion diffusion pathway in HEs is still dominated by the polymer, especially for polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based HEs. The main limitation of PEO is the strong temperature dependence of its ionic conductivity, preventing its use at room temperature (RT). Herein, a cross-linked polymer-based HE with a high ionic conductivity of 1.1 × 10-3 S cm-1 at RT is presented. The novel cross-linked copolymer, composed of pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA), tri(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether (TEG), and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide (LiTFSI), serves as a matrix to achieve satisfactory mechanical strength. Integrated Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) particles are covalently bound to the copolymer by a prior surface modification step. To demonstrate the suitability of the developed HE for RT application in advanced battery systems, a solid-state lithium-sulfur cell is built which exhibits an initial specific capacity of 688 mA h g-1. The ability of this HE to operate at RT can be expected to boost the development of safe all-solid-state batteries for many applications.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107912
Ameliorating the electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility in Li-ion solid-state batteries with plasticizer,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) based on poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP)/LiTFSI/LLZO/different wt% of tetra-ethylene-glycol-dimethyl-ether (TEGDME) were prepared using the facile solution casting method or phase-inversion method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements were used to identify the structures and complexations of the prepared electrolyte films. The morphology and thermal stability of the electrolytes were investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The ionic conductivity of all electrolyte films was analyzed using AC impedance analysis between 298 and 353 K. The data supports that the 30 wt% TEGDME CSE exhibited the highest ionic conductivity (6.2 × 10–5 S cm–1 at 25 ℃ and 3.6 × 10–4 S cm–1 at 60 ℃) and a wide electrochemical window (4.87 V vs. Li/Li+). A solid-state battery with LiFePO4/Li-metal was cycled using the 0.1 C rate at 60 °C for 100 cycles, resulting in a high initial discharge capacity of 157 mAh g–1 with a good coulombic efficiency of> 99%. This admirable electrochemical performance can be attributed to the high ionic conductivity of the electrolyte and its electrochemical stability. We emphasize the significant role of the TEGDME plasticizer in the performance of the CSE as well as the ionic conductivity and compatibility of the electrolyte with the electrode in the solid-state battery. All encouraging results confirm that the CSE has the potential to be a high-voltage electrolyte for Li-ion solid-state batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.167077
Rationally designing composite gel polymer electrolyte enables high sulfur utilization and stable lithium anode,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The lithium-sulfur battery is an attractive energy-storage device with low cost and high energy density. However, its development is still restricted by “shuttle effect”, lithium dendrite growth and safety problem. Herein, a novel PEO-PAN-LLZO composite gel polymer electrolyte (CGPE) was designed to overcome these issues. A porous composite membrane with excellent mechanical and interfacial properties was formed after casting dispersion of PAN, PEO, LLZO sheets, which can effectively absorb electrolyte, inhibit “shuttle effect” and protect lithium anode. A conductive acetylene black layer was coated on the membrane to further hinder the migration and enhance the redox kinetics of polysulfides. The CGPE based lithium-sulfur battery displays remarkably high specific capacities (1459 and 942 mAh/g at 0.1 and 1C respectively) and outstanding cycling performance (555 mAh/g at 1C after 500 cycles, average decay/cycle of 0.082%). The unique CGPE is promising for the practical application of high-performance lithium-sulfur battery.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.138195
All-solid-state lithium batteries featuring hybrid electrolytes based on Li+ ion-conductive Li7La3Zr2O12 framework and full-concentration gradient Ni-rich NCM cathode,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Solid hybrid electrolytes (SHE) composed of Li+-conductive oxides and polymer electrolytes combine the beneficial properties of ceramic and polymeric materials. In this study, we designed and synthesized a three-dimensional Li6.4La3Zr2Al0.2O12 (LLZO) framework with a continuous ion-conduction pathway. This 3D framework was hybridized with a poly(Ɛ-caprolactone)-based solid polymer electrolyte to obtain a free-standing and flexible film for an all-solid-state lithium battery. The hybrid electrolyte exhibited high ionic conductivity, good mechanical strength, a high transference number, and excellent electrochemical stability compared with those of solid polymer electrolytes. Symmetric Li/SHE/Li cells exhibited good cycling stability without short-circuiting, indicating a uniform plating/stripping of lithium and good interfacial properties toward lithium metal. LiNi0.78Co0.10Mn0.12O2 with a full-concentration gradient (FCG78) was synthesized and investigated for applications in all-solid-state batteries. Coupled with the unique compositional and morphological properties of FCG78, the all-solid-state Li/FCG78 cell featuring SHE delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 172.4 mAh/g and exhibited good cycling stability with a capacity retention of 84.3 % after 200 cycles at 0.5 C.

In this work, Li6.4Ga0.2La3-xYbxZr2O12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) has been synthesized by solid-state reaction method. The effect of Ga and Yb co-doping on the crystal structure, morphology, densification, and electrical performance was investigated. The doping with Ga3+ stabilized the cubic phase while the doping with Yb3+ optimized Li+ transport channel size and accelerated the densification of the ceramics. Li6.4Ga0.2La2.95Yb0.05Zr2O12 (relative density 94.8%) exhibited the highest total conductivity (8.96 × 10−4 S·cm−1 at 30 °C) and the lowest activation energy of 0.28 eV.

The high discharge capacity and capacity retention of LiFePO4/Li6.4Ga0.2La2.95Yb0.05Zr2O12/Li solid-state batteries indicate that Ga and Yb co-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 ceramic should be a promising electrolyte.",Ionics,10.1007/s11581-022-04787-x
In situ polymerization infiltrated three-dimensional garnet-based framework for quasi-solid lithium metal batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSolid-state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) using nonflammable solid electrolytes (SEs) are considered to be the new generation of energy storage devices with high energy density and good safety. However, many challenges, such as insufficient room-temperature ionic conductivity of SEs and tremendous electrode-electrolyte interfacial impedance, hinder the commercialization of solid-state LMBs. Here, we reported a novel composite solid electrolyte (CSE), consisting of a three-dimensional (3D) Li6.25Ga0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) nanoparticle-based framework and filled tripropylene gycol diacrylate (TPGDA)-based gel electrolytes, in which the gel electrolytes are prepared by in situ polymerization of the TPGDA monomer in the condition of liquid electrolyte. Owing to the high content of LLZO powder and PVDF binder, the nonflammable CSE shows superior thermal stability and outstanding mechanical property. Moreover, the CSE exhibits high room-temperature ionic conductivity (1.66 × 10−3 S⋅cm−1) due to the large amount of liquid electrolyte loaded in the 3D framework. Besides, in-situ gel electrolytes facilitate the interfacial contact between electrolyte and lithium anode. Therefore, the LiFePO4/CSE/Li cell exhibits excellent cycling stability at room temperature, delivering a capacity retention ratio of 86.5% after 350 cycles at 1 C. This work can provide guidance in designing CSEs for high-performance lithium metal batteries.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.141353
Influence of the particle size of the Ni-rich cathode material on the electrochemical properties for all solid-state batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Recently, all-solid-state lithium ion batteries (ASLBs) have emerged as the next generation lithium ion batteries due to safety issue for electric vehicles and energy storage system.

Doped superior garnet electrolyte toward all-solid-state Li metal batteries,"© 2022Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnets are one of the most promising solid electrolytes for next generation all-solid-state Li metal batteries due to their high ionic conductivities, chemical stabilities to metallic lithium and wide electrochemical window. Single and co-doped LLZO with Ga, Al, Nb were prepared by solid state reaction and sintered under oxygen atmosphere. Lithium ion conduction properties were investigated through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range of −25 °C–45 °C. Among the doped compositions, Ga doped single phase cubic LLZO shows the highest ionic conductivity of 1.49 × 10−3 S/cm at room temperature and activation energy of 0.27eV, which is one of the best results reported in literature so far in terms of doped garnet structured LLZO. All single or co-doped LLZO samples exhibit low electronic conduction which are 4–5 orders of magnitude lower than their corresponding ionic conductivities.

Sintering analysis of garnet-type ceramic as oxide solid electrolytes for rapid Li+ migration,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMetallic doping can stabilize cubic phase Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte for high conductivity, due to the enhanced vacancies and disordered Li-site. However, the understanding of metallic doping in the crystal lattice during the high-temperature sintering process is still not clear. In present study, a gradient series of Fe doped LLZO are formulated via solid-phase reaction, and then investigated through crystal analysis and morphological characterization. Pair distribution function essay implies that doped Fe3+ promotes random distribution of Li+ over the available sites in the located crystal. Additionally, the ceramic morphology confirms that the particles sizes in LLZO pellets suddenly grow above 1000 ℃, and Fe doping can obviously suppress Li loss above 600 ℃. As a result, the LLZF0.15 exhibits the relatively high ionic conductivity of 1.99 × 10–5 S cm–1 at 45 ℃.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.08.053
Visualizing the failure of solid electrolyte under GPa-level interface stress induced by lithium eruption,"© 2022, The Author(s).Solid electrolytes hold the promise for enabling high-performance lithium (Li) metal batteries, but suffer from Li-filament penetration issues. The mechanism of this rate-dependent failure, especially the impact of the electrochemo-mechanical attack from Li deposition, remains elusive. Herein, we reveal the Li deposition dynamics and associated failure mechanism of solid electrolyte by visualizing the Li|Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) interface evolution via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Under a strong mechanical constraint and low charging rate, the Li-deposition-induced stress enables the single-crystal Li to laterally expand on LLZO. However, upon Li “eruption”, the rapidly built-up local stress, reaching at least GPa level, can even crack single-crystal LLZO particles without apparent defects. In comparison, Li vertical growth by weakening the mechanical constraint can boost the local current density up to A·cm−2 level without damaging LLZO. Our results demonstrate that the crack initiation at the Li|LLZO interface depends strongly on not only the local current density but also the way and efficiency of mass/stress release. Finally, potential strategies enabling fast Li transport and stress relaxation at the interface are proposed for promoting the rate capability of solid electrolytes.",Nature Communications,10.1038/s41467-022-32732-z
High-energy and durable lithium metal batteries using garnet-type solid electrolytes with tailored lithium-metal compatibility,"© 2022, The Author(s).Lithium metal batteries using solid electrolytes are considered to be the next-generation lithium batteries due to their enhanced energy density and safety. However, interfacial instabilities between Li-metal and solid electrolytes limit their implementation in practical batteries. Herein, Li-metal batteries using tailored garnet-type Li7-xLa3-aZr2-bO12 (LLZO) solid electrolytes is reported, which shows remarkable stability and energy density, meeting the lifespan requirements of commercial applications. We demonstrate that the compatibility between LLZO and lithium metal is crucial for long-term stability, which is accomplished by bulk dopant regulating and dopant-specific interfacial treatment using protonation/etching. An all-solid-state with 5 mAh cm−2 cathode delivers a cumulative capacity of over 4000 mAh cm−2 at 3 mA cm−2, which to the best of our knowledge, is the highest cycling parameter reported for Li-metal batteries with LLZOs.

Mechanofusing garnet solid electrolyte on the surface of Ni-rich layered oxide cathode towards high-rate capability of cylindrical Li-ion battery cells,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The interface between solid electrolytes and cathode materials determines charge storage mechanism of Li-ion batteries; however, it has not yet been fully investigated and understood. Herein, a diluted amount at 1 wt% of heterogenous lithium garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte particles was chemically bonded to the Ni-rich LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathode by a scalable mechanofusion process. The interface chemistry was intensively investigated by an ex situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). In situ X-ray diffraction was also used to investigate the charge storage mechanism of LLZO-NMC811. It was found that the LLZO-LaNiO3-NMC811 strong bond at the interface can enhance the microstructural stability leading to high-rate capability up to 7.5C. For the charge storage mechanism, the lithium intercalation/deintercalation in NMC-LLZO undergoes a slower phase transition since the LLZO-LaNiO3 interface can modulate Li concentration gradient and kinetics where the surface of NMC will not be fully emptied (during charge) or filled (during discharge). This will benefit the rate capability of LLZO-modified NMC material in which the Li concentration at the surface will not quickly reach a threshold value before the cut-off voltage. The practical applications of LLZO-NMC811 were eventually demonstrated in 2.1 Ah 18650-format cells with high-capacity retention and high-rate capability.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232043

By adjusting the LLZO nanonetwork with different weight ratios (5 wt%, 10 wt%, and 15 wt%) relative to the total weight of the PEO/TPU/LiTFSI/LLZO (PTLL) composite electrolyte, the electrochemical behavior of the gel electrolyte was optimized. When filled with a 10 wt% Li7La3Zr2O12 nano-network, the PTLL has a maximum ionic conductivity of 1.33 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 60 °C and an electrochemical stability window of 5.6 V. Furthermore, the LiFePO4/PTLL/Li battery presents an initial specific discharge capacity of 170 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C. After 100 cycles, it demonstrated superior cycle durability at 0.5 C at 60 °C, representing 96.1 % of the initial capacity.

The effects of electric field on physical properties of LLZO made by flash sintering method,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is one of the promising electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries. Since in conventional sintering, lithium retention is hard to control in LLZO, flash sintering, characterized by shorter sintering time and lower sintering temperature, can be beneficial. In this study, Al-doped LLZO (LALZO)powder was successfully synthesized by the combustion sol-gel method. The product was characterized by thermal analysis (TG/DTA) to evaluate its thermal behavior. Afterward, the effect of an electrical field in an isothermal approach on the relative density and phase composition of LALZO has been investigated. The obtained LALZO powder was uniaxially pressed into a dog-bone shape at 100 MPa. The samples were held in a tube furnace at 850 °C with an applied DC electrical field ranging from 40 V.cm−1 to 100 V.cm-1, while the current density was limited to 200 mA.mm−2. The phase composition was analyzed with X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the ionic conductivity was investigated using an AC impedance spectroscopy. Dense LALZO was flash sintered successfully, and the sample sintered with an electric field of 60 V.cm−1 showed a pure cubic LALZO with 92.4% relative density and a total ionic conductivity of 0.31 mS and activation energy of 0.37 eV. Moreover, it was revealed that the change in the electric field does not significantly affect the relative density. Also, increasing the electric field causes the incubation time to become shorter. This behavior is thought to be due to electric field strength as a driving force for nucleation mechanisms.",Solid State Ionics,10.1016/j.ssi.2022.116054
Study on the role of Li2O–Ga2O3-GeO2-Gd2O3 glass doped into Li7La3Zr2O12 solid-state electrolyte,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this study, Li2O–Ga2O3-GeO2-Gd2O3 (LGGG) glass is doped into Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramic in proportions of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 wt% by a conventional solid-state reaction method. The main crystalline phase that existed in this composite electrolyte is proved to be cubic phase LLZO by XRD patterns.

This work also verifies that doping the same amount of identified elements into LLZO ceramics in the form of glass can obtain higher ionic conductivity and relative density than in the form of oxides (2.40 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 92.03%). A symmetric cell composed of this electrolyte reveals a good cycling performance and low overpotential in a total of 230 cycles at a current density of 0.125 mA cm−2. These results confirm the potential of this LGGG-LLZO composite electrolyte for applicating in new generation all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries.",Materials Chemistry and Physics,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2022.126762
New Insights on the Origin of Chemical Instabilities Between Poly(carbonate)-based Polymer and Li-containing Inorganic Materials,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Composite electrolytes, owing to their ability to combine both polymeric and ceramic properties are promising candidates for Solid-State-Batteries (SSBs). In this paper, we assess the effect of ceramic fillers (Li1+xAlxTi2-xP3O12, Li6.55Ga0.15La3Zr2O12 and Al2O3) in a poly(ethylene oxide carbonate)-LiTFSI matrix. First, the role of the filler chemistry on thermal and electrochemical properties is evaluated: reduced polymer crystallinity leads to an increased ionic conductivity at low temperatures; and the ionic conductivity at low temperatures (<30 °C) is improved for LLZO filler particles. This behaviour is commonly attributed to new conduction pathways generated within the fillers. However, we also demonstrate that a polymer degradation is induced by the filler chemistry by modifying the polymer chemistry in poly(ethylene glycol), initiated by LiOH that can be found on the LLZO surface. The electrolyte containing LATP or Al2O3 does not induce any degradation. Hence, special attention must be paid to surface impurities, as degradation may occur.",ChemPhysChem,10.1002/cphc.202200296

However, the applications of this type of batteries are limited owing to their narrow operating temperature range, low ionic conductivity, poor long-term stability, and complex production process. Herein, a simple approach that combines all potential battery candidates that have been investigated over the last few years, including polyethylene oxide (PEO), Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), succinonitrile (SN), and Li salt (LiTFSI), is employed to solve the limitations of ASSLBs. LLZO codoped with Al3+ and Nb5+ (NAL) is synthesized at a low temperature using a modified sol-gel Pechini method. NAL, along with SN, plays a critical role in improving the performance of the resultant solid polymer electrolyte, which can be operated at room temperature.

Reduced synthesis temperature and significantly enhanced ionic conductivity for Li6.1Ga0.3La3Zr2O12 electrolyte prepared with sintering aid CuO,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is considered as a promising solid electrolyte. However, the synthesis of LLZO often requires a high temperature, which may lead to the evaporation of the lithium and result in a decrease in ionic conductivity. Therefore, it is an important issue how to reduce the synthesis temperature of LLZO and simultaneously increase its ionic conductivity. Herein, we synthesized garnet-type solid electrolytes of Li6.1Ga0.3La3Zr2O12 (LLZO-Ga) with x wt% CuO (x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2) by the traditional solid-state reaction method, in which CuO was introduced as a sintering aid to reduce the sintering temperature of LLZO-Ga and increase its Li-ion conductivity. It is found that adding a small amount of CuO as an additive can reduce the sintering temperature from 1100 ℃ to about 1000 ℃. As a result, when the amount of CuO is 0.5 wt%, LLZO-Ga shows the highest room-temperature ionic conductivity and the lowest activation energy, which are 1.111 mS/cm and 0.27 eV, respectively.",Ionics,10.1007/s11581-022-04761-7

The composition of the black mixtures derived from the precursors is ascertained. The phase evolution and structural properties from the ceramic mother powders to the final ceramic electrolytes are discussed in detail. The characteristic of cubic LLZO with the space group I-43d arises in the Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12 ceramic electrolyte pellet after the secondary higher-temperature (1200 °C) sintering.

Preparation of high ionic conductivity composite solid electrolyte with in-situ synthesis of LLZO@ZiF-67,"© 2022PEO based solid electrolyte has high crystallinity, which seriously hinder the transport of lithium ions at room temperature, resulting in low ionic conductivity. In this paper, a high performance composite solid electrolyte membrane with LLZO@ZiF-67 as an inorganic filler and PEO as matrix was synthesized. The LLZO@ZiF-67 inorganic filler, which covered by in-situ synthesis of ZiF-67 layer on surface of LLZO, show a large specific surface area and a polyhedral structure. The introduction of LLZO@ZiF-67 effectively reduce the crystallinity of PEO, providing a continuous channel for the transport of lithium ions, which result in a ionic conductivity as high as 1.09×10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature of the composite electrolyte PLZ-20. Furthermore, the electrochemical stability and interface compatibility to lithium metal are improved. The lithium stripping/plating process at 0.1 mA cm−2 can maintain stable for more than 600 h without short circuit. In addition, the initial discharge capacity of the full battery (Li / PLZ-20 / LFP) can reach up to 141.1 mA h g−1 with retention of 91.45% after 100 cycles, which provide possibility for the application of high performance solid state battery.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.141155

Here, we employ a coupled far-field high-energy diffraction microscopy and tomography approach for assessing the chemo-mechanical behaviour for dense, polycrystalline garnet (Li7La3Zr2O12) solid electrolytes with grain-level resolution. In situ monitoring of grain-level stress responses reveals that the failure mechanism is stochastic and affected by local microstructural heterogeneity. Coupling high-energy X-ray diffraction and far-field high-energy diffraction microscopy measurements reveals the presence of phase heterogeneity that can alter local chemo-mechanics within the bulk solid electrolyte. These local regions are proposed to be regions with the presence of a cubic polymorph of LLZO, potentially arising from local dopant concentration variation. The coupled tomography and FF-HEDM experiments are combined with transport and mechanics modelling to illustrate the degradation of polycrystalline garnet solid electrolytes. The results showcase the pathways for processing high-performing solid-state batteries.",Nature Materials,10.1038/s41563-022-01333-y
Rapid thermal processing of garnet-based composite cathodes,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Rapid thermal annealing techniques enable quick and non-contact processing of ceramic materials and are particularly promising for materials containing elements with high vapor pressure. For example, Li-ion conductive oxide-ceramics such as the garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) need to be densified in order to be used as separators or in composite cathodes of all-solid-state batteries (ASB), but suffer from lithium loss at elevated temperatures. To address this issue, the sintering method “rapid thermal processing” (RTP) is used to fabricate ceramic composite cathodes of LLZO and LiCoO2 (LCO), the cathode active material. The cathodes were deposited on LLZO separators by screen-printing, a scalable industrial process for the fabrication of ceramic components. A detailed analysis by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the successful mitigation of secondary phase formation between LCO and LLZO. The subsequent application of In-metal anodes resulted in fully inorganic ASB that were electrochemically cycled.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231872
Li7La3Zr2O12Protonation as a Means to Generate Porous/Dense/Porous-Structured Electrolytes for All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Ceramic Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) represents a promising candidate electrolyte for next-generation all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries. However, lithium-metal batteries are prone to dendrite formation upon fast charging. Porous/dense and porous/dense/porous LLZO structures were proposed as a solution to avoid or at least delay the formation of lithium-metal dendrites by increasing the electrode/electrolyte contact area and thus lowering the local current density at the interface. In this work, we show the feasibility of producing porous/dense/porous LLZO by a new and scalable method. The method consists of LLZO chemical deep protonation in a protic or acidic solvent, followed by thermal deprotonation at high temperatures to create the porous structure by water and lithium oxide elimination. We demonstrate that the produced structure extends the lifetime of Li/LLZO/Li symmetric cells by a factor of 8 compared to a flat LLZO at a current density of 0.1 mA/cm2and with a capacity of 1 mAh/cm2per half-cycle. We also show clear improvement of the Li/LLZO/LiFePO4full cell performance with a thermally deprotonated LLZO.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c11375
Stabilize garnet/electrode interface via low-melting polymer layer in solid-state lithium metal battery,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdAll-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLB) possess great potentials in constructing safer yet higher energy-density lithium batteries to substitute for current liquid lithium-ion battery, but the poor solid-solid contact at the electrode|electrolyte exerts an ultra-high interfacial resistance to the battery system which often leads to a working failure at moderate room temperature. To overcome this lithium mitigation barrier at solid interfaces to enable ASSLB working at room temperature range, a brand-new lithium salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide))-polymer (polytetrahydrofuran) composite buffer layer (PPEI) was introduced to facilitate lithium ion pass between garnet-type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) solid electrolyte(SE) and anode or cathode electrodes. The PPEI layer owns a unique glassy transition temperature near 36.7 ℃ which enables room temperature lithium conduction up to ∼10−5 S/cm. Moreover, with simple solvent-free casting method, PPEI displayed well improved contact with lithium, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode and LLZTO solid electrolyte and expanded electrochemical window up to 5.3 V vs Li+/Li. Bearing these advantages, the impedance of the assembled solid-state Li|PPEI|LLZTO|PPEI|LFP cell was decreased by more than one order of magnitude. And it can be successfully operated at 25 ℃ for more than 130 cycles, with a capacity retention surpassing 98%.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140907
Effect of Ga2O3 Addition on the Properties of Garnet-Type Ta-Doped Li7La3Zr2O12 Solid Electrolyte,"© 2022 by the authors.Garnet-type Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramic solid electrolytes with Ga2O3 additive were synthesized using a conventional solid-state reaction process. When the amounts of Ga2O3 additive were below 2 mol %, the sintered sample has a dense structure composed of grains with an average size of 5 to 10 μm, whereas 3 mol % or more Ga2O3 addition causes a significant increase in grain size above several 10 to 100 μm, due to high-temperature sintering with a large amount of liquid Li-Ga-O phase. At room temperature, the highest total (bulk + grain-boundary) ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS cm−1 was obtained in the sample with 5 mol % Ga2O3 addition. However, this sample was shorted by Li dendrite growth into solid electrolyte at a current density below 0.2 mA cm−2 in galvanostatic testing of the symmetric cell with Li metal electrodes. The tolerance for Li dendrite growth is maximized in the sample sintered with 2 mol % Ga2O3 addition, which was shorted at 0.8 mA cm−2 in the symmetric cell. Since the interfacial resistance between Li metal and solid electrolyte was nearly identical among all samples, the difference in tolerance for Li dendrite growth is primarily attributed to the difference in microstructure of sintered samples depending on the amounts of Ga2O3.",Batteries,10.3390/batteries8100158
Lithium Ionic Conductive Mechanism in PEO Polymer Electrolytes Enhanced by Nano/Micron Size LLZO Fillers,"© 2022 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS""). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) incorporating inorganic ceramic fillers are key solutions of all solid-state lithium battery technology applications. At present, the conductive mechanism of LLZO-PEO electrolyte is still controversial. Herein, the effect of nano and micron LLZO on the conductive mechanism of PEO matrix with different molecular weight is studied. The low molecular weight PEO electrolyte (LSPEs) containing nano LLZO exhibit higher conductivities than those with the micron ones, which is primarily caused by the percolation effect resulting from the difference in specific surface area. However, for high molecular weight PEO electrolytes (HSPEs), the addition of nano LLZO ceramic fillers can mainly lead to reduce the crystallinity of HSPEs to enhance the motion of polymer segment. Thus, compared with HSPEs alone, the nano LLZO-HSPEs show conductivities one order of magnitude larger. Besides, the discharge capacity of nano LLZO-HSPEs based LiFePO4/Li batteries at 1 C is around 131 mAh g-1 at 60 °C, as well as discharge specific capacity holds 99.2% after 200 cycles. Notably, nano LLZO ceramic fillers will enhance cyclic performance of LiFePO4/Li batteries at 0.2 C and 40 °C, which still maintain 126.7 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1149/1945-7111/ac9554
Origin of Lithiophilicity of Lithium Garnets: Compositing or Cleaning?,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Garnet-type Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO), a promising solid-state electrolyte, is reported to exhibit lithiophobicity. Herein, it is demonstrated that the origin of the lithiophobicity is closely related to the surface compositions of both the lithium and LLZTO. Surface impurities with high melting points such as Li2O, Li2CO3, LiOH, or LiF inhibit the wettability between lithium metal and LLZTO, and the widely adopted compositing strategy may improve the wettability by merely breaking the surface impurity layers. A simple but effective “polishing-and-spreading” strategy is proposed to remove the surface impurities and obtain clean Li/LLZTO interfaces. Thus, a tight and continuous Li/LLZTO interface with an interfacial resistance of 17.5 Ω cm2 is achieved, which leads to stable cycling of the symmetric Li cells and a critical current density up to 2.8 mA cm–2. This work provides a new perspective to understand the lithiophilicity of garnet-type electrolytes and contributes to designing robust Li/garnet interfaces.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202205778
From protonation & Li-rich contamination to grain-boundary segregation: Evaluations of solvent-free vs. wet routes on preparing Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesGarnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has been recognized as a candidate solid electrolyte for high-safety Li-anode based solid-state batteries because of its electro-chemical stability against Li-metal and high ionic conductivity. Solvent (e.g., isopropanol (IPA)) has been commonly applied for preparing LLZO powders and ceramics. However, the deterioration of the proton-exchange between LLZO and IPA/absorbed moisture during the mixing and tailoring route has aroused less attention. In this study, a solvent-free dry milling route was developed for preparing the LLZO powders and ceramics. For orthogonal four categories of samples prepared using solvent-free and IPA-assisted routes in the mixing and tailoring processes, the critical evaluation was conducted on the crystallinity, surficial morphology, and contamination of as-calcinated and as-tailored particles, the cross-sectional microstructure of green and sintered pellets, the morphology and electro-chemical properties of grain boundaries in ceramics, as well as the interfacial resistance and performance of Li anode based symmetric batteries. The wet route introduced Li-rich contaminations (e.g., LiOH∙H2O and Li2CO3) onto the surfaces of LLZO particles and Li-Ta-O segregations at the adjacent and triangular grain boundaries. The LLZO solid electrolytes prepared through dry mixing in combination with the dry tailoring route without the use of any solvent were found to the optimal performance. The fundamental material properties in the whole LLZO preparation process were found, which are of guiding significance to the development of LLZO powder and ceramic production craft.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2022.05.036
On the interfacial lithium dynamics in Li7La3Zr2O12:poly(ethylene oxide) (LiTFSI) composite polymer-ceramic solid electrolytes under strong polymer phase confinement,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.A better molecular-level understanding of Li+ diffusion through ceramic/polymer interfaces is key to design high-performance composite solid-state electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries. By considering as a case study a composite electrolyte constituted by Li+ conductive Ga3+ doped-Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet fillers embedded within a poly(ethylene oxide) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide polymer matrix (PEO(LiTFSI)), we investigate Li+ interfacial dynamics at conditions of high polymer confinement, with large filler particles in a fully amorphous polymer phase. Such confinement scenario is aimed to capture the conditions near the percolation threshold, at which conductivity enhancement is often reported. Using molecular dynamics simulations combined with the generalized shadow hybrid Monte Carlo method and umbrella sampling calculations, we explain why the hopping towards the polymer phase of the Li+ sitting on the LLZO surface is thermodynamically hindered, while hopping of Li+ from the polymer to the LLZO is kinetically slowed-down by rigidified polymer near the interface. In addition, we demonstrate how the overlap of LLZO-bound polymer chains at high confinement leads to a decrease of Li+ diffusivity within the interstitial space. We put forward that these insights are relevant to interpret the variation of ionic conductivity as a function of volume fraction and filler particle sizes also below the glass transition temperature of the polymer, at the typical operating conditions of lithium ion batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2022.05.069
Influence of Al on the structure and ion transport in garnet-type Li7La3-xAlxZr2O12 solid electrolytes for Li-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.This work reports on the preparation of garnet-type Al-doped Li7La3-xAlxZr2O12 (x = 0, 0.1, and 0.2) electrolytes for solid-state Li-ion batteries. The undoped and Al-doped cubic phase LLZO has been synthesized by conventional solid-state mixing and annealing at 1000 °C for 2 h. The prepared materials have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrical properties were evaluated by impedance spectroscopy at varies temperatures. The ionic conductivities of Li7La3Zr2O12, Li7La2.9Al0.1Zr2O12, and Li7La2.8Al0.2Zr2O12 were determined to be 1.8x10−6, 4.1x10−6, and 6.5x10−6 S cm−1 at 100 °C respectively and their activation energy has been derived as 0.70, 0.69 and 0.73 eV from the Arrhenius plot. The DC conductivities were calculated as 1.6x10−4, 3.3x10−4, and 5.7x10−4 S cm−1 for Li7La3Zr2O12, Li7La2.9Al0.1Zr2O12, and Li7La2.8Al0.2Zr2O12 respectively. Furthermore, the hopping rates, charge carrier concentration, ionic mobility, and diffusion coefficient were also calculated and the results show an increasing trend with increasing temperature.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.199
Increasing the performance of all-solid-state Li batteries by infiltration of Li-ion conducting polymer into LFP-LATP composite cathode,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Polymer-ceramic composites combine the benefits of polymers and ceramics. In particular, the infiltration of the ceramic cathode with a Li-ion-conducting polymer in an all-solid-state Li-ion battery enhances the utilization of the cathode active material (CAM) and enables the application of thicker cathodes with higher storage capacity. This concept has already been validated in our earlier work, in which a porous LiCoO2–Li6.45Al0.05La3Zr1.6Ta0.4O12 (LLZO:Al:Ta) composite cathode was fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. However, its performance stability was low. In the present work, the concept is modified using an LFP-LATP cathode with LiFePO4 as the CAM, Li1.5Al0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 as the ion-conducting phase, and tape-casting with free sintering instead of SPS. Both tape-casting and free sintering are more relevant for large-scale production. The sintered LFP-LATP cathode is infiltrated with the MEEP polymer and LiC2NO4F6S2 ion-conducting salt. A full cell with the polymer-infiltrated cathode, LLZO:Al:Ta separator, and Li anode shows nearly full LFP utilization in the 100 μm thick cathode with an excellent area-specific storage capacity of above 3 mAh cm−2. However, after a few dozen cycles, a Li dendrite penetrates the separator leading to abrupt capacity fading. The prevention of Li dendrite formation remains a challenge for our future work.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231822
Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12-Based Solid-State Lithium Batteries Achieved by In Situ Thermally Polymerized Gel Polymer Electrolyte,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a potential solid electrolyte for solid-state batteries (SSBs) because of its high ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and mechanical strength. However, large interface resistances arising from deserted cathodes and rigid garnet/electrode interfaces block its application. In order to deal with this issue, a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) was introduced into the cathode and both sides of LLZO to achieve a solid-state battery. Especially, the provided GPE could be thermally polymerized and solidified in situ, which would integrate LLZO with both anode and cathode and dramatically simplify the battery manufacturing process. Since the interface from rigid LLZO is improved by the flexible GPE buffer, the inability of flexible GPE to inhibit lithium dendrites is compensated by the rigid LLZO in return. As a result, the interface resistances are reduced from 6880 to 473 ω, the Li symmetric cell exhibits a flat galvanostatic charge/discharge for 400 h without lithium dendrites, and the solid-state Li|GPE@LLZO|LiCoO2 battery exerts a capacity retention of 82.6% after 100 cycles at 0.5 C at room temperature. Such an interfacial engineering approach represents a promising strategy to address solid-solid interface issues and provides a new design for SSBs with high performance.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c09028
Safety Evaluation of All-Solid-State Batteries: An Innovative Methodology Using in Situ Synchrotron X-ray Radiography,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) are expected to be a relevant solution to increase the energy density in lithium-ion battery (LiB) technology. However, the energy management requires high-energy storage capacities, which make the safety a crucial issue. Unfortunately, it is difficult so far to assess the safety of nonfully mature battery technologies. In this paper, we describe a methodology to study the thermal runaway of a wide range of ASSB technologies. We specifically designed a closed calorimeter to be used in operando experiments with high-speed synchrotron X-ray radiography for the validation of the principle. Electrodes removed from LiB at 100% state of charge have been reassembled in ASSB, with an LLZO (lithium lanthanum zirconium niobium oxide) electrolyte. For the first time, we were able to observe and compare the thermal runaway of ASSB and liquid electrolyte (LiB) using this methodology. An 11% decrease of heat release was measured in comparison with LiB during the thermal runaway. Such a methodology can assist in the development of future battery technologies, by evaluating battery safety from the start of the design to battery composition to cell shape.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.2c01514
A High-Filled Li7La3Zr2O12/Polypropylene Oxide Composite Solid Electrolyte with Improved Lithium-Ion Transport and Safety Performances for High-Voltage Li Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The optimized combination of the organic/inorganic components in a composite solid electrolyte (CSE) plays a crucial role in improving its ion conductivity and thermal-mechanical performances. In this work, a high-filled Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO)/polypropylene oxide (PPO) CSE film was prepared by introducing LLZO microparticles in a flexible PPO polymer electrolyte. As the content of LLZO increases, the lithium-ion migration pattern is changed from migrating with the PPO chain segment movement to along the continuous fast ion conducting networks formed by the high-filled LLZO particles. When the LLZO content reaches 45 wt %, the room-temperature ion conductivity is up to 3.79 × 10-4S cm-1, and the potential window is about 5 V. Meanwhile, the addition of LLZO particles enhances the mechanical and thermal properties of the PPO electrolyte, the maximum tensile strength reaches 56.41 Mpa, and the temperature resistance reaches above 200 °C. This CSE film with improved ion transport and safety performances shows high practical significance in the development of solid-state lithium batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.2c01487
Probing the Phase Transition during the Formation of Lithium Lanthanum Zirconium Oxide Solid Electrolyte,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO) has long been considered as a promising solid electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium (Li) metal batteries because of its interfacial stability when coupled with a Li metal anode. However, the cubic phase of LLZO (c-LLZO) with a higher Li-ion conductivity has a complex atomic structure and is subject to complicated phase transition during its processing and working conditions, which remain largely elusive. Here, we reveal the phase transition process during the formation of c-LLZO nanotubes through detailed microscopic characterization by scanning and transmission electron microscopy as well as X-ray diffraction. We find four typical stages during the formation of c-LLZO along with several intermediate phases including lanthanum (La)-rich cubic lanthanum zirconium oxide (La-rich c-LZO), c-LZO, and La-rich c-LLZO. We also reveal the role of m-Li2CO3 and h-Li2O2 as the ""phase mediator"".",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c09660
Fabrication and electrochemical behavior of flexible composite solid electrolyte for bipolar solid-state lithium batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.To improve the performance of solid-state lithium batteries (SSLB), solid-state succinonitrile (SCN) is incorporated into a composite solid electrolyte (CSE) comprising Al-doped LLZO (Li6.4Al0.2La3Zr2O12), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and lithium salts, thereby conferring flexibility to the CSE. SCN acts as a solid-state plasticizer that increased the ion conduction and interfacial control between the materials. The flexible CSE sheet exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 2.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 40 °C and a wide potential window of ∼5.2 V vs. Li/Li+. The solid SCN provides new synergistic properties such as an additional ion conduction path and suppresses PEO oxidation. When the CSE with 7 wt% SCN is utilized as the cathode layer and solid electrolyte layer in SSLBs, instead of the liquid electrolyte, a discharge capacity of approximately 130 mAh g−1 is realized at 45 °C and 0.1C, whilst a capacity retention rate of 90% and a coulombic efficiency of 99% are obtained over 100 cycles. A 3-stack bipolar cell is fabricated to evaluate the mechanical properties of the flexible CSE sheet, demonstrating stable cycle performance over 50 cycles without any short circuiting or leakage current.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231789
"Influence of sintering atmosphere on the phase, microstructure, and lithium-ion conductivity of the Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte","© 2022Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Al–LLZO) solid electrolytes were sintered at 1150 °C for 8 h in atmosphere of oxygen, argon and air (named as Al–LLZO–O2, Al–LLZO–Ar and Al–LLZO–Air, respectively). All the Al–LLZO samples exhibited a single cubic garnet-type structure. The sample of Al–LLZO–O2 possessed the highest relative density (95.60%) and the largest average grain size among the three Al–LLZO samples.

Thermodynamics as a Driving Factor of LiCoO2Grain Growth on Nanocrystalline Ta-LLZO Thin Films for All-Solid-State Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.All-solid-state batteries primarily focus on macrocrystalline solid electrolyte/cathode interfaces, and little is explored on the growth and stability of nanograined Li-garnet and cathode ones. In this work, a thin (∼500 nm) film of LiCoO2 (LCO) has been grown on top of the polycrystalline layer of Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Ta-LLZO) solid electrolyte using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. Scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and electron tomography demonstrated that the LCO film is formed by columnar elements with the shape of inverted cones. The film appears to be highly textured, with the (003) LCO crystal planes parallel to the LCO/Ta-LLZO interface and with internal pores shaped by the {104} and {102} planes. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, this specific microstructure is governed by a competition between free energies of the corresponding crystal planes, which in turn depends on the oxygen and lithium chemical potentials during the deposition, indicating that thermodynamics plays an important role in the resulting LCO microstructure even under nonequilibrium PLD conditions. Based on the thermodynamic estimates, the experimental conditions within the LCO stability domain are proposed for the preferential {104} LCO orientation, which is considered favorable for enhanced Li diffusion in the positive electrode layers of all-solid-state batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c07176
Effects of Al Doping on the Properties of Li7La3Zr2O12 Garnet Solid Electrolyte Synthesized by Combustion Sol-Gel Method,"© 2022, Iran University of Science and Technology. All rights reserved.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnets are considered as promising materials for electrolytes in solid-state batteries. In this study, Li7-3xAlxLa3Zr2O12 (x= 0.22, 0.25, and 0.28) garnet was synthesized using the combustion sol-gel method to stabilize the cubic phase for higher ionic conductivity. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of as-synthesized powders revealed that by addition of 0.22 and 0.25 mole Al, the tetragonal persists to exist, whereas 0.28 mole Al addition resulted in a single cubic phase. Afterward, the as-synthesized powders were pressed and sintered at 1180°C for 10h. The hardness evaluation revealed that Al addition increased the hardness that caused better resistance against Li dendrite formation. The secondary electron microscopy results demonstrated that the dopant did not have a huge impact on particle size and grain growth. However, the porosity content was changed. Finally, electrochemical behaviour studies showed that, the addition of Al increased the ionic conductivity of samples by increasing the density and stability of the cubic phase. The results indicated that the sample containing 0.25 mole Al sample had the highest ionic conductivity. This behaviour is believed to be the result of the promotion of sintering and an increase in the bulk ionic conductivity by Al doping.",Iranian Journal of Materials Science and Engineering,10.22068/ijmse.2631
Synergetic Effect of Li-Ion Concentration and Triple Doping on Ionic Conductivity of Li7La3Zr2O12 Solid Electrolyte,"© 2022 by the authors.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a promising and safe solid electrolyte for all-solid-state batteries. To achieve high ionic conductivity of LLZO, stabilizing the cubic phase and reducing Li loss during the sintering process is essential. Therefore, reducing the sintering temperature, which increases the sintering time for high-density pellets, is necessary. Herein, we investigate the change in the crystal structure, morphology, and Li ionic conductivity of LLZO pellets by triple doping with Al, Ga, and Ta and modulating the variation in initial Li concentrations. Interestingly, the proportion of the conductive cubic phase increased with increasing Li stoichiometry by 1.1 times, and this tendency was further accelerated by triple doping. The synergetic effects of triple doping and Li concentration also minimized Li loss during sintering. Accordingly, it provided a high-quality LLZO pellet with good ionic conductivity (3.6 × 10−4 S cm−1) and high relative density (97.8%). Notably, the LLZO pellet was obtained using a very short sintering process (40 min). Considering that the most time-consuming step is the sintering process for LLZO, this study can provide guidelines for the fast production and commercialization of LLZO electrolytes with high ionic conductivity.",Nanomaterials,10.3390/nano12172946
Transport and mechanical behavior in PEO-LLZO composite electrolytes,"© 2022, The Author(s).Composite solid electrolytes (CEs), wherein ion-conducting polymer and ceramic/glass is mixed, are promising candidates for all-solid-state batteries due to their promise of acceptable ionic conductivity and mechanical properties compared to their individual constituents. While numerous studies have focused on improving the performance of CEs, it is still unclear what the material targets are that can result in improved macroscopic performance especially in light of the coupled needs for high transport and high mechanical strength in these materials. In this study, a two-dimensional (2D) mathematical model is developed to investigate electrochemical and mechanical characteristics of CEs. The model is compared to CEs consisting of poly-ethylene-oxide (PEO) polymer and lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO) ceramic material with examination of the impact of varying LLZO volume fractions. The potential drop at the PEO-LLZO interface is evaluated using the junction potential theory. Using experimental data from the literature, the model estimates the ionic conductivity, effective transference number, and mechanical stiffness of the CEs. While the mechanical stiffness improves with increasing volume fraction of LLZO, the impact on conductivity and transference number depends on interfacial resistance at the interface. Finally, the study reports CE’s potential to enhance Li-ion transport and mechanical properties to inhibit lithium (Li) dendrite growth.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry,10.1007/s10008-022-05231-w
Synthesis of a low Li to Zr mole ratio of lithium lanthanum zirconate Li0.5xLa0.5xZr1−xO12−δ,"© 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Australian Ceramic Society.In this research, a low mole ratio formula Li to Zr of Li0.5xLa0.5xZr1−xO12−δ(LLZO*) with various x = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 was synthesized. The research aims to understand the crystal structure and the electrochemical properties of the new formula of Li0.5xLa0.5xZr1−xO12−δ, in which the Li to Zr mole ratio is smaller than the common cubic garnet of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). A different sintering treatment was also applied to understand whether the material properties are only a matter of chemical formula or are also affected by the sintering method. The first sintering method was firing at 1230 °C for 6 h under air to produce LLZO*(A), and the second method was firing at 900 °C for 6 h under Ar flows to produce LLZO*(B). The XRD analysis found that the LLZO*(A) was crystallized mainly to tetragonal structure, and cubic pyrochlore secondary phase, with a small amount of cubic structure. Meanwhile, the LLZO*(B) was crystallized mainly into cubic and tetragonal structure. The impedance analysis found that LLZO*(B) shows a higher ionic conductivity than LLZO*(A), i.e., 7.573 × 10−5 S.cm−1. A full-cell impedance measurement of LiFePO4-LLZO*(B)-mcmb shows that LLZO*(B) x = 0.1 has the lowest Li+ migration resistance of 223.8 Ω confirming the promising material for solid electrolyte.",Journal of the Australian Ceramic Society,10.1007/s41779-022-00782-7
"Synthesis, structural and conductive properties of Nd doped garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 Li-ion conductor","© 2022Garnet type solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is the most promising candidate among solid electrolytes for all solid state Li batteries. In this work, small amount of Nd doping (5%–20%) to the garnet structure is proposed to improve its ionic conductivity. Nd doped garnet type solid electrolytes for Li-ion batteries were synthesized through a conventional solid state reaction method. The effect of Nd doping on the microstructure, morphology and ionic conductivity of the LLZO was studied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. Instead of La whose valence is similar to that of Nd, XRD and Raman analyzes revealed that Nd takes the place of the higher valence element Zr. In order to compensate the valence difference, the ratio of Li increases in the structure. On the other side, results showed that Nd doped LLZO samples formed as a mixture of both tetragonal and cubic phases. According to EIS measurements, among the prepared samples, 5% Nd doped LLZO exhibits the highest ionic conductivity of 2.47 × 10−6 S cm−1 at room temperature.",Current Applied Physics,10.1016/j.cap.2022.06.004
Achieving enhanced densification and superior ionic conductivity of garnet electrolytes via a co-doping strategy coupled with pressureless sintering,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLithium garnet oxides with 6.5 mol Li, such as Li6.5La3Zr1.5(Ta/Nb)0.5O12, typically crystallise in cubic structure and exhibit excellent room-temperature ionic conductivity close to 1 mS cm−1. However, it is challenging to densify garnet oxides. In this work, we investigated how the co-doping of tantalum (Ta) and niobium (Nb) affects the densification of pressureless sintered garnet electrolytes with compositions of Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta(0.5−x)NbxO12, where x = 0–0.5. The highest densification (94.5% of relative density) was achieved in Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.1Nb0.4O12 (TN-LLZO) when it was sintered at 1150 °C for 6 h. This TN-LLZO garnet electrolyte delivers an ionic conductivity of 1.04 × 10−3 S cm−1 (at 22 °C) with a low activation energy of 0.41 eV. Our findings demonstrate that the content of dopants (Ta and Nb) plays a critical role in enhancing the sintering performance of garnet ceramics at ambient pressure.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.04.059
Compositional and structural control in LLZO solid electrolytes,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Garnet-based solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) represent a promising class of materials for next-generation batteries with improved safety and performance. However, lack of control over the composition and crystal structure of the well-known Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet material has led to poor reproducibility with a wide range of ionic conductivities reported in the literature. In this study, the role of precursor homogeneity in controlling the compositional and structural evolution of Al-doped LLZO is explored. A novel solution-based synthesis approach is employed to demonstrate enhanced atomic-scale mixing of the starting materials in comparison to conventional solid-state preparation methods. Through this technique, it is shown that the stability and formation temperature of the highly conductive cubic phase is directly impacted by the spatial distribution of the doping element and reactant species in the precursor mixture. Precursor homogeneity was also an important factor in mitigating the formation of unwanted secondary impurities. These findings can be used to guide the synthesis of SSEs with reproducible material characteristics and enhanced electrolytic performance.",RSC Advances,10.1039/d2ra03303h
Quantifying lithium enrichment at grain boundaries in Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte by correlative microscopy,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.One of the key materials for all-solid-state batteries based on oxide electrolytes is the polycrystalline Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). It has been reported that metallic Li can accumulate at LLZO grain boundaries during operation, causing a short circuit and, hence, a failure of the battery. However, it is not known to date if Li under its ionic state is enriched at grain boundaries of LLZO already during processing. This is because probing and quantifying lithium reliably remains difficult or sometimes even impossible with most microscopy techniques. Therefore, in the present work the grain boundaries in LLZO are investigated by atom probe tomography and correlative microscopy (combination of atom probe tomography with scanning electron microscopy) at the sub-nanometer level. Interestingly, Li-based phases denoted as complexions (where Li is most probably found in an oxidized state) have been discovered at grain boundaries. High frequency impedance spectroscopy revealed that the grain boundaries exhibit a lower conductivity and thus affect the Li-transport in LLZO. Furthermore, these Li-based complexions may facilitate the formation of dendrites and support short circuits in LLZO solid electrolytes.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231417
Local Li+Framework Regulation of a Garnet-Type Solid-State Electrolyte,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Garnet-type solid-state electrolytes Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) for high-energy-density batteries have attracted extensive attention. However, stabilizing the high-conductive cubic phase and improving its ionic conductivity remain challenges of current research. Here, a Ca-W dual-substitution strategy has been designed, and the effect of doping on cubic phase formation and Li+ mobility has been investigated thoroughly. The results indicated that the partial substitution of Ca2+ at the La3+ site and W6+ at the Zr4+ site can effectively stabilize the cubic phase while reducing the endothermic enthalpy during the synthesis. Moreover, Ca-W dual substitution regulates the local Li+ framework by increasing Li+ occupancy at the 96h site, which can significantly lower the Li+ migration barrier and thus improve the ionic conductivity by two orders of magnitude. This work addresses the challenge of stabilizing a highly conductive cubic phase with low-energy consumption and represents a major breakthrough in understanding how to improve the ionic conductivity by regulating local structures.",ACS Energy Letters,10.1021/acsenergylett.2c01432
A Simple and Efficient Strategy for Ameliorating Li/LLZO Interfacial Contact,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) is considered as one of the most promising solid-state electrolytes for lithium (Li) metal batteries due to its wide electrochemical window and good electrochemical stability against Li metal. However, undesired lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) contamination cannot be avoided and it turns the LLZO surface to a lithophobic surface. The consequent large interfacial resistance limits its electrochemical performances. Herein, a drop-casting method using metal oxides is introduced to remove Li2CO3and improve the interfacial contact between Li metal and Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12(LLZTO). For example, due to the reduction and alloying reactions between gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and molten Li, a Li-Ga-O layer is formed, which exhibits an excellent wetting property on the LLZTO surface. During the alloying process of the lithiophilic Li-Ga-O interlayer, it breaks the Li2CO3contamination layer into fragments by alloying expansion force, allowing the Li-Ga-O interlayer to spread to the LLZTO surface. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact, the interfacial resistance decreases from 1789 to 4.35 ω/cm2. The Li symmetric cell cycles over 2000 hs under 0.235 mA/cm2and the Li|Ga2O3@LLZTO|LiCoO2full cell works for 100 cycles at room temperature.",Energy and Fuels,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c01770
Nano-structured Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 coated LiCoO2 enabling compatible interface with ultrathin garnet-based solid electrolyte for stable Li metal battery,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdGarnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramics has been considered as an ideal solid-state electrolyte for Li metal cells because of its high ionic conductivity and relatively stable interface with Li. However, it is electrochemically incompatible with some high-voltage cathodes, e.g. LiCoO2. In this work, a nanoscale Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) fast ion conductor was coated on LiCoO2 (only 1 wt% LATP), bringing obviously enhanced interfacial compatibility with a composite electrolyte composed of Al, Nb-codoped LLZO and polyethylene oxide (PEO). A free-standing, flexible and ultrathin (20 μm) electrolyte membrane was successfully fabricated by a facile and scalable route, even though with a high ceramics content (67 wt%). Quasi-solid-state coin and pouch-type Li cells were assembled with the LATP-coated LiCoO2 cathode, free-standing composite electrolyte and Li anode, together with soft interface modification by in-situ polymerization. The cells show stable cycling due to combined factors of enhanced electrode/electrolyte compatibility, ultrathin nature of the electrolyte membrane and the in-situ built soft interface. The pouch cells can be cycled for 300 cycles at 0.3 C and 60 °C with 80% retention. The pouch cells can endure abuse tests of bending, cutting and nail penetration. At a practical LiCoO2 loading of 3 mAh cm−2, the Li|LiCoO2 pouch cell still shows stable cycling with 90% retention after 100 cycles at 60 °C (0.2 C charge/0.5 C discharge). This work provides a practical method to fabricate high-performance solid-state Li cells.",Materials Today Nano,10.1016/j.mtnano.2022.100235
Constructing stable Li-solid electrolyte interphase to achieve dendrites-free solid-state battery: A nano-interlayer/Li pre-reduction strategy,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Solid-state batteries based on Li and nonflammable solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have aroused the attention of numerous researchers because of their absolute safety and potentially high energy density. Most SSEs after coming into contact with Li are reduced, which leads to high interfacial charge-transfer impedance and dendrites formation. In this study, an “interlayer-Li pre-reduction strategy” was proposed to solve the above problem of reduction. An intermediate layer was introduced between solid electrolyte and Li, and it reacted with Li to produce a stable and ion-conductive interphase. Cubic garnet-type Nb-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Nb-LLZO) was selected as an example solid electrolyte since it is characterized by high ionic conductivity, feasible preparation under ambient conditions, as well as low cost. The high impedance arising from the reduction at the Nb-LLZO∣Li interface has limited its application. In this paper, a nano-scale Li phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) layer was deposited on the Nb-LLZO pellets through radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, which pre-reacted with Li in-situ to produce a lithiophilic, electronically insulating, and ionic conductive interphase. The produced interphase significantly inhibited the reduction of Nb5+ against Li and the formation and propagation of Li dendrites. It is noteworthy that Li∣LiPON∣Nb-LLZO∣LiPON∣Li cells stably cycled for over 2,000 h without any short circuit. This study emphasizes and demonstrates the significance of the pre-conversion of modification layer between unstable SSE and Li metal to improve interfacial stability.

However, the inherent cycle instability and safety problems of traditional liquid lithium–sulfur batteries greatly limit their commercial applications.

The introduction of PTFE membrane further improved the mechanical properties and thermal stability of the electrolyte.

Recent advances of Li7La3Zr2O12-based solid-state lithium batteries towards high energy density,"© 2022To satisfy the demand for high energy density and high safety lithium batteries, garnet-based all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are the research hot spots in recent decades. Within the garnet family, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a promising candidate for solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) that has been extensively investigated due to the high ionic conductivity, chemical stability, electrochemical stability, air stability, thermal stability and safety. Recently, several laboratory-scale works on LLZO-based ASSLBs are achieved. However, although LLZO-based SSEs have made tremendous advancements today, there are still several critical issues in the practical application of ASSLBs with high energy density and low cost. Herein, optimization of LLZO structure, preparation of high-quality LLZO-based SSEs, engineering of the interface between LLZO-based SSEs and realization of LLZO-based ASSLBs with high energy density are systematically analyzed, discussed, and summarized to offer a clearer comprehension of the crucial challenges and future research orientations. It is expected to not only enhance the knowledge of audiences in this field but also facilitate the achievement of practical commercial applications in LLZO-based ASSLBs.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.04.026
Composite Solid Electrolyte for High Voltage Solid-State Li-Metal Battery,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.A composite solid electrolyte (CSE) was prepared by incorporating Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) particles, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI), and different concentrations of a solid plasticizer in a poly(vinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) matrix. Subsequently, we investigated the ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability of the CSE, and its interfacial compatibility with a Li-metal electrode. 30 wt.% plasticizer with CSE exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 4.23×10−4 and 8.14×10−4 S cm−1 at 25 and 60 °C, respectively, with an excellent stability of up to 4.76 V vs. Li/Li+. The CSE is sandwiched between the Li-metal and NCM811 for the fabrication of a solid-state battery (SSB), which delivers a discharge capacity (163 mAh g−1) at a rate of 0.2 C (60 °C). The LiNbO3 (LNO) modification over the NCM811 cell delivers a high discharge capacity of 198 mAh g−1, excellent rate capability, and good cycle life. Furthermore, the LNO coating on the surface of the NCM811 cathode, which effectively improves the contact between the cathode and electrolyte, eventually leads to an increase in the discharge capacity. Therefore, the prepared CSE is a good choice for use in SSB; moreover, the LNO coating noticeably improved the cycling stability, reversibility, and rate capability compared to an unmodified NCM811 cathode in the SSB configuration.",ChemElectroChem,10.1002/celc.202200317
Inorganic–Organic Hybrid Electrolytes Based on Al-Doped Li7La3Zr2O12 and Ionic Liquids,"© 2022 by the authors.Featured Application: All-solid-state lithium battery. Organic–inorganic hybrid electrolytes based on Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and two different ionic liquids (ILs), namely N-ethoxyethyl-N-methylpiperidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI IL) and N-ethoxyethyl-N-methylpiperidinium difluoro(oxalato)borate (DFOB IL), were prepared with the aim of improvement of inherent flexibilities of inorganic solid electrolytes. The composites were evaluated in terms of thermal, spectroscopical, and electrochemical properties. In the impedance spectra of LLZO composites with 15 wt% ILs, a semi-circle due to grain boundary resistances was not observed. With the sample merely pressed with 1 ton, without any high-temperature sintering process, the ionic conductivity of 10−3 S cm−1 was achieved at room temperature. Employing a ternary composite of LLZO, FSI IL, and LiFSI as an electrolyte, all-solid-state lithium metal batteries having LiFePO4 as a cathode were assembled. The cell exhibited a capacity above 100 mAh g−1 throughout the course of charge–discharge cycle at C/20. This confirms that FSI IL is an effective additive for inorganic solid electrolytes, which can guarantee the ion conduction.",Applied Sciences (Switzerland),10.3390/app12147318
Low electronic conductivity of Li7La3Zr2 O12 solid electrolytes from first principles,"© 2022 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.Lithium-rich garnets such as Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) are promising solid electrolytes with potential application in all-solid-state batteries that use lithium-metal anodes. The practical use of garnet electrolytes is limited by pervasive lithium-dendrite growth, which leads to short-circuiting and cell failure. One proposed mechanism of lithium-dendrite growth is the direct reduction of lithium ions to lithium metal within the electrolyte, and lithium garnets have been suggested to be particularly susceptible to this dendrite-growth mechanism due to high electronic conductivities relative to other solid electrolytes. The electronic conductivities of LLZO and other lithium-garnet solid electrolytes, however, are not yet well characterized. Here, we present a general scheme for calculating the intrinsic electronic conductivity of a nominally insulating material under variable synthesis conditions from first principles, and apply this to the prototypical lithium-garnet LLZO. Our model predicts that under typical battery operating conditions, electron and hole mobilities are low (<1cm2V-1s-1), and bulk electron and hole carrier concentrations are negligible, irrespective of initial synthesis conditions or dopant levels. These results suggest that the bulk electronic conductivity of LLZO is not sufficiently high to cause bulk lithium-dendrite growth during cell operation, and that any non-negligible electronic conductivity in lithium garnet samples is likely due to extended defects or surface contributions.",Physical Review Materials,10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.085401
Improvement of density and electrochemical performance of garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 for solid-state lithium metal batteries enabled by W and Ta co-doping strategy,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSolid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) have caught research interest for their desirable safety and energy density. However, low density, poor uniformity of the solid-state electrolytes (SSEs), and dendrite penetration through the SSEs are the major problems that hinder the progress in SSLMB's development. Herein, a co-doping strategy is proposed for garnet-type electrolyte by utilizing a well-designed lithium-rich additive Li2WO4 (LWO) doping into Li6·5La3Zr1·5Ta0·5O12 (LLZT). LWO addition yields a denser and more uniform material by acting as a sintering aid and providing an inner Li2O atmosphere. W substitutes the Zr element and forms Ta and W-doped LLZO, and second phase, which broadens the sintering temperature range of LLZT and avoids abnormal grain growth (AGG). With 2 wt% LWO, LLZT-2LWO has an ionic conductivity of 0.6 mS/cm and a relative density of 98.67%. Moreover, the critical current density (CCD) of LLZT-2LWO reaches 1.0 mA cm−2. LLZT-2LWO achieves long cycling stability for 300 h at 0.5 mA cm−2, showing an excellent dendrite-suppression capability. The full cell matched with LiNi0·6Co0·2Mn0·2O2 and sulfur cathode displays high discharge capacity and cycling stability. This modification strategy has high efficiency and is conducive to large-scale production, which opens a new opportunity for SSLMBs.",Materials Today Energy,10.1016/j.mtener.2022.101034
"Comparative analysis on the thermal, structural, and electrochemical properties of Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolytes through solid state and sol-gel routes","© 2022 The AuthorsOver the last decade, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has shown to be one of the most promising materials as a solid electrolyte in Li-ion batteries. However, several factors can affect the final electrochemical properties of the material, such as the synthesis method and the inclusion of dopants. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of undoped and Al-doped LLZO prepared through solid state and sol-gel methods. An in-situ thermal investigation on the synthesis of LLZO shows how solid state synthesis forms LLZO at lower rates, however the resulting LLZO is more stable at higher temperatures. The addition of Al as a dopant further increases the thermal stability of the material by lowering its decomposition rate. Ionic conductivity measurements reveal how sol-gel LLZO samples experience several times higher conductivity than their solid state counterparts due to tightly interconnected grains. With the addition of Al, the conductivity further increases by two orders of magnitude. With that we are able to achieve the highest ionic conductivity of 4.96 × 10−4 S/cm for Al-doped sol-gel LLZO and an activation energy of 0.28(1) eV. This work provides a better understanding of how different synthesis methods affect the final properties of LLZO solid electrolytes.",Solid State Ionics,10.1016/j.ssi.2022.115943
All-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries assembled by composite polymer electrolyte and amorphous sulfur/rGO composite cathode,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.All-solid-state lithium‑sulfur batteries are becoming a breakthrough technology for energy storage systems due to its high energy density, high safety and low cost of sulfur. However, its application has been restricted by the isolating properties of sulfur (S), as well as S shuttle effect, S volume effect, and low electron conductivity. In this work, the amorphous sulfur-reduced graphene oxide (S/rGO) composite cathode material was prepared with a smaller particle size of about 2 nm S onto rGO to alleviate the volume effect of S (after 30 cycles, the charge transfer impedance changes about only 3 Ω); at the same time, highly conductive rGO maintain good ionic conduction during charge-discharge cycling. Along with the cathode material, we fabricated a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) based on poly (ethylene oxide), lithium-ion conductor Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12-succinonitrile (PEO18- LiTFSI-LLZO-SN) possessing lithium conductivities of 1.16 × 10−4 and 7.26 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature and 60 °C, respectively, which can mitigate the transport of polysulfide and be suitable for battery applications. The composite cathode material exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 783mAh g−1 at 45 °C, with a capacity retention rate of 81.2% at 0.2C after 60 cycles. At 60 °C, the battery shows excellent electrochemical cyclability 820mAh g−1 of reserved capacity after stable operation for 100 cycles at 0.2C. The synergy between the CPE and the amorphous S/rGO composite cathode demonstrated in this work may bring insights to improve the cycling performance of all-solid-state Li-S batteries",Solid State Ionics,10.1016/j.ssi.2022.115926
Digestion processes and elemental analysis of oxide and sulfide solid electrolytes,"© 2022, UT Battelle, LLC under exclusive license to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Detailed elemental analysis is essential for a successful development and optimization of material systems and synthesis methods. This is especially relevant for Li- and Na-containing compounds, found in state-of-the-art and next-generation battery systems. Their materials’ properties and thus the final device performance strongly depend on the crystal structure, the stoichiometry, and defect chemistry, e.g., influencing charge carrier concentration and activation energies for vacancy transport. However, a detailed quantitative analysis of light elements in a heavy matrix, featuring a broad range of solubilities and vapor pressures, is often difficult and associated with large uncertainties and thus neglected in favor of just reporting the stoichiometry as “weighed in.” In this work, we report several approaches to digest and dissolve various oxide and sulfide-based materials, used in next-generation Li batteries, for elemental analysis via optical emission spectroscopy. These include the most common solid electrolytes Li-La-Ti–O, a perovskite material (LLTO), and Li-La-Zr-O which has garnet structure (LLZO). Additionally, a facile thermal digestion process is reported for a surrogate sulfide solid electrolyte (Na2S). The digestion procedures reported here are suitable for almost any laboratory environment and, when applied, will improve understanding of the synthesis-structure–property correlations needed to advanced batteries with all solid-state configurations.",Ionics,10.1007/s11581-022-04536-0
Preparation of transparent LLZTO electrolyte and its application in the observation of Li dendrite,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.The application of solid-state electrolytes endows the distinctive features of high safety and high energy density for lithium (Li) metal batteries. Among all kinds of solid-state electrolytes, garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) with high Young's modulus is a promising candidate. Nevertheless, Li metal can still grow inside LLZO and lead to short circuit. But it is difficult to determine the failure mechanism caused by Li dendrite due to the opacity of the common LLZO. Herein, a transparent Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) electrolyte is fabricated for the observation of Li growth inside the electrolyte directly. The factor that influences the transparency of LLZTO is investigated thoroughly, which is crucial for studying the behavior of Li metal during the plating process inside LLZTO. Results demonstrate that the amount of residual Li-containing compound at grain boundaries is the dominant factor influencing the transparency of LLZTO. The formation of Li filament and its growth process inside transparent LLZTO are also observed directly.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.176
All-Solid-State Li Batteries with NCM-Garnet-Based Composite Cathodes: The Impact of NCM Composition on Material Compatibility,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Garnet-based all-solid-state batteries (ASBs) with high energy density require composite cathodes with high areal loading and high-capacity cathode active materials. While all ceramic cathodes can typically be manufactured via cosintering, the elevated temperatures necessary for this process pose challenges with respect to material compatibility. High-capacity cathode active materials like Ni-rich LiNixCoyMn1-x-yO2(NCM) show insufficient material compatibility toward the solid electrolyte Li6.45Al0.05La3Zr1.6Ta0.4O12(LLZO:Ta) during cosintering, leading to the formation of highly resistive interphases. We investigated this secondary phase formation both experimentally and via density functional theory calculation to get a mechanistic understanding of the cosintering behavior of LLZO:Ta with NCM111 and Ni-rich NCM811. Furthermore, we employed B doping of both NCM materials in order to assess its impact on the cation interchange and subsequent secondary phase formation. While secondary phases were formed for all four NCM materials, their onset temperature, nature, and amount strongly depend on the NCM composition and doping. Surprisingly, Ni-rich NCM811 turned out to be the most promising cathode active material for the combination with garnet-type LLZO:Ta. As proof of concept, fully inorganic, ceramic all-solid-state lithium batteries featuring only a Li-metal anode, an LLZO:Ta separator, and a composite cathode, consisting of LLZO:Ta, Li3BO3, and NCM811, were prepared by conventional sintering. The purely inorganic full cells delivered a high specific areal discharge capacity of 0.7 mA h cm-2in the initial cycle.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.2c00533
Effect of Nb and Ta Simultaneous Substitution on Self-Consolidation Sintering of Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has been a prospective solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and a wide electrochemical window. Different from conventional cold or hot isostatic pressing methods, a self-consolidation strategy without any pressing assistance was proposed to prepare dense LLZO. In this work, simultaneous substitution of Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 was attempted to further explore the mechanism of self-consolidation sintering. The influence of the Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 substitution amount on the crystalline phase, morphology, and ionic conductivity was investigated. Due to the different melting points and thermal behaviors of Nb2O5 and Ta2O5, the endothermic peak corresponding to sintering became weaker, which was associated with the self-consolidation process of LLZO. Accordingly, larger grain sizes and fewer grain boundaries were observed in LLZO when the amounts of Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 were both 0.25 mol. This indicates that the simultaneous substitution of different cations plays a vital role in self-consolidation sintering, which contributes to facilitating the grain growth and reducing the amount of grain boundaries. This work emphasizes the key role of the dopant melting point and thermal behavior in sintering, suggesting an alternative way of substitution for LLZO electrolyte preparation.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.2c01018
Flexible machine-learning interatomic potential for simulating structural disordering behavior of Li7La3Zr2O12solid electrolytes,"© 2022 Author(s).Batteries based on solid-state electrolytes, including Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), promise improved safety and increased energy density; however, atomic disorder at grain boundaries and phase boundaries can severely deteriorate their performance. Machine-learning (ML) interatomic potentials offer a uniquely compelling solution for simulating chemical processes, rare events, and phase transitions associated with these complex interfaces by mixing high scalability with quantum-level accuracy, provided that they can be trained to properly address atomic disorder. To this end, we report the construction and validation of an ML potential that is specifically designed to simulate crystalline, disordered, and amorphous LLZO systems across a wide range of conditions. The ML model is based on a neural network algorithm and is trained using ab initio data. Performance tests prove that the developed ML potential can predict accurate structural and vibrational characteristics, elastic properties, and Li diffusivity of LLZO comparable to ab initio simulations. As a demonstration of its applicability to larger systems, we show that the potential can correctly capture grain boundary effects on diffusivity, as well as the thermal transition behavior of LLZO. These examples show that the ML potential enables simulations of transitions between well-defined and disordered structures with quantum-level accuracy at speeds thousands of times faster than ab initio methods.",Journal of Chemical Physics,10.1063/5.0090341
The Role of the Reducible Dopant in Solid Electrolyte-Lithium Metal Interfaces,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Garnet solid electrolytes, of the form Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), remain an enticing prospect for solid-state batteries owing to their chemical and electrochemical stability in contact with metallic lithium. Dopants, often employed to stabilize the fast ion conducting cubic garnet phase, typically have no effect on the chemical stability of LLZO in contact with Li metal but have been found recently to impact the properties of the Li/garnet interface. For dopants more ""reducible""than Zr (e.g., Nb and Ti), contradictory reports of either raised or reduced Li/garnet interfacial resistances have been attributed to the dopant. Here, we investigate the Li/LLZO interface in W-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZWO) to determine the influence of a ""reducible""dopant on the electrochemical properties of the Li/garnet interface. Single-phase LLZWO is synthesized by a new sol-gel approach and densified by spark plasma sintering. Interrogating the resulting Li/LLZWO interface/interphase by impedance, muon spin relaxation and X-ray absorption spectroscopies uncover the significant impact of surface lithiation on electrochemical performance. Upon initial contact, an interfacial reaction occurs between LLZWO and Li metal, leading to the reduction of surface W6+ centers and an initial reduction of the Li/garnet interfacial resistance. Propagation of this surface reaction, driven by the high mobility of Li+ ions through the grain surfaces, thickens the resistive interphases throughout the material and impedes Li+ ion transport between the grains. The resulting high resistance accumulating in the system impedes cycling at high current densities. These insights shed light on the nature of lithiated interfaces in garnet solid electrolytes containing a reducible dopant where high Li+ ion mobility and the reducible nature of the dopant can significantly affect electrochemical performance.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1021/acs.chemmater.2c00379
Water-Based Fabrication of a Li|Li7La3Zr2O12|LiFePO4Solid-State Battery─Toward Green Battery Production,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Solid-state lithium batteries (SSLBs) are considered to be one of the most promising next-generation Li batteries due to their high capacity and intrinsic safety. However, their sustainable processing is often poorly investigated but could offer additional advantages over conventional batteries in terms of ecological and economic benefits. In this work, a sustainable, water-based processing route for garnet-supported SSLBs featuring a LiFePO4(LFP)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) composite cathode is presented. Both the LFP-PEO cathode and the thin free-standing garnet separator (105 μm) are fabricated by water-based tape-casting. After optimizing the composition of the cathode, the full cell with a thin cathode (∼45 μm) delivers a high capacity of 136 mAh g-1with a high Coulombic efficiency over 99% and good cycling stability for 50 cycles. However, the performance and cycling stability decrease when thicker cathodes (∼110 μm) and higher rates were applied, indicating the need for further optimization. Nevertheless, the here-presented water-based fabrication route provides a baseline for further improvements and pushes SSLB fabrication further toward a green battery production.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c01349
Improvement of the Interface between the Lithium Anode and a Garnet-Type Solid Electrolyte of Lithium Batteries Using an Aluminum-Nitride Layer,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The next generation of all-solid-state batteries can feature battery safety that is unparalleled among conventional liquid batteries. The garnet-type solid-state electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), in particular, is widely studied because of its high Li-ion conductivity and stability in air. However, the poor interface-contact between Li and the electrolyte (garnet) severely limits the development of solid electrolytes. In this study, we synthesize cubic phase Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) using a secondary sintering method. In addition, a thin aluminum nitride (AlN) layer is introduced between the metal (Li) and the solid electrolyte. Theoretical calculations show that AlN has a high affinity for Li. Furthermore, it is shown that the AlN coating can effectively reduce the interface impedance between Li and the solid electrolyte and improve the lithium-ion transport. The assembled symmetric Li cells can operate stably for more than 3600 h, unlike the symmetric cells without AlN coating, which short-circuited after only a few cycles. The hybrid solid-state battery with a modified layer, which is assembled using LiFePO4 (LFP), still has a capacity of 120 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles, with a capacity retention rate of 98%. This shows that the introduction of an AlN interlayer is very helpful to obtain a stable Li/solid-electrolyte interface, which improves the cycling stability of the battery.",Nanomaterials,10.3390/nano12122023
Energy landscape for Li-ion diffusion in the garnet-type solid electrolyte Li6.5La3Zr1.5Nb0.5O12(LLZO-Nb),"© 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.A comprehensive understanding of the nexus of diffusion mechanisms on the atomic scale as well as structural influences on the ionic motion in solid electrolytes is key for further development of high-performing all-solid-state batteries. Therefore, current research not only focuses on the search for innovative materials, but also on the study of diffusion pathways and ion dynamics in ionic conductors. In this context, we report on the extended characterization of the ionic electrolyte Li6.5La3Zr1.5Nb0.5O12 (LLZO-Nb). The commercially available material is analyzed by a combination of powder X-ray (either lab- or synchrotron-based) and neutron diffraction. Details of lithium disorder were obtained from high-resolution neutron diffraction data, from which the ionic transport of Li ions was determined by applying the maximum entropy method in combination with the one-particle potential formalism.",Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung - Section B Journal of Chemical Sciences,10.1515/znb-2022-0068
"The effect of a Ta, Sr co-doping strategy on physical and electrochemical properties of Li7La3Zr2O12 electrolytes","© 2022In this study, Ta single-doped Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (Ta0.6) and a series of Ta, Sr co-doped Li6.4+xLa3-xSrxZr1.4Ta0.6O12 (Ta0.6Srx, x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) electrolytes are synthesized via a two-step process. The XRD result reveals that all samples have a pure cubic phase, which indicates that Ta5+ and Sr2+ can enter the lattice of LLZO and stabilize the cubic phase. The SEM images exhibit that all samples have a dense microstructure and tight grain boundary without obvious holes. The excellent properties are achieved when the doping amount of Sr reaches 0.2 mol. Among all designed samples, the Ta0.6Sr0.2 has the highest Li+ conductivity and relative density of 8.54 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 98.79%, respectively, as well as the lowest activation energy roughly 0.302 eV. Additionally, the symmetrical cell's galvanostatic cycling data show that it has excellent cycling performance and extremely low overpotentials even after 350 cycles, indicating that it can be successfully applied to next-generation all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASSLIBs).",Solid State Ionics,10.1016/j.ssi.2022.115917
Influence of lithium metal anode coated with a composite quasi-solid electrolyte on stabilizing the interface of all-solid-state battery,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Solid-state lithium batteries (SSLBs) are perceived as cutting-edge technology and have garnered considerable interest due to the high energy density and safety they could offer. However, the poor interfacial contact between the solid electrolyte and the electrodes limits its immediate commercial application. In this paper, a composite quasi-solid electrolyte (CQE) comprising Li6.6La3Zr1.6Sb0.4O12 (LLZO-Sb) garnet oxide, 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (BMITFSI), and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is investigated for Li-ion battery application. The primary aspiration of this work is to reduce the interfacial resistance between electrode/electrolyte by making a composite electrolyte that establishes a stable, conformal contact with Li metal and cathode film. The direct coating of electrolyte paste onto the lithium metal eradicates the need for an interface layer and assists in reducing the dendrite formation. The symmetric cell Li ||CQE|| Li displays a low interfacial resistance as small as 75 Ω. Furthermore, the symmetric cell demonstrates steady lithium stripping/platting behavior with less voltage hysteresis and manifests good stability up to a current density of 500 μA cm−2. The fabricated cell with Li||CQE||LFP configuration shows the first discharge capacity of 148 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C rate, and at the end of 100 discharge cycles, 125 mAh g−1 capacity is observed. The excellent performance displayed by the direct coating of composite quasi-solid electrolyte over lithium metal anode provides an alternate route for the practical development of high-energy–density lithium batteries.",Ionics,10.1007/s11581-022-04517-3
Guidelines to correctly measure the lithium ion conductivity of oxide ceramic electrolytes based on a harmonized testing procedure,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Ionic conductivities of Li-ion conducting ceramic electrolytes, mostly evaluated by means of impedance spectroscopy, are a key parameter decisive for their application. Nevertheless, significant deviations in the ionic conductivity of nominally identical samples are reported in literature, which are attributed to material and sample preparation as well as measurement related differences. The goal of this study is a detailed assessment of impedance measurement deviations of 10 identically prepared samples of each Li6.45La3Zr1.6Ta0.4Al0.05O12 (LLZO:Ta:Al) and Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP), respectively. By introducing a harmonized testing procedure for impedance measurement and data analysis, deviations among the participating labs were reduced to differences <1.8% for LLZO and <3.1% for LATP. A complete assessment of instrumentation (fitting, temperature and impedance measurement errors) and sample geometry related errors revealed a high measurement precision with a total error <1.1%. Further on a decreasing ionic conductivity was observed for both materials during the study. Indications for testing and storage induced aging mechanisms were obtained by additional measurements.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231323
Laplace-Fourier transform solution to the electrochemical kinetics of a symmetric lithium cell affected by interface conformity,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium (Li)-metal batteries using solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have attracted extensive attention owing to their high energy density. However, the interface issues arising from the Li stripping/plating cycles pose a major challenge for the applications of these batteries. This paper reports a three-dimensional (3D) time-dependent electrokinetic model, built based on the Nernst–Planck equation with electroneutrality assumption, to quantify the effects of interface conformity, external pressure, electrolyte Young's modulus, and ionic conductivity on the electrochemical behaviors of symmetric solid-state lithium cells. The evolution of interface morphology is related to the surface roughness, elastoplastic deformation, creep, and plating of the Li metal. The Laplace-Fourier domain solution is analytically derived, and the numerical solution is solved by implementing Talbot's Laplace transform method and the continuous convolution-Fourier transform (CC-FT) algorithm. A number of cases are analyzed, and the results reveal that a non-conformal interface with imperfect contact can induce uneven field distributions and that the nonuniformity increases with contact loss, and that the impact of external pressure on the reduction in ionic conductivity of SSE is similar to its effect on the potential drop. The results also suggest that the external pressure of 12.5 MPa can lead to relatively uniform deposition in a ceramic electrolyte system, while only 2 MPa is required in a polymer electrolyte system. In addition, A pressure of at least 2 MPa is needed to maintain the high ionic conductivity level for polymer composite SSEs of 14–16% volume LLZO particles.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231305
Study on the suppression of lithium dendrites based on solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 with annealing treatment of Al interlayer,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The lithium dendrites growth in Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolytes has severely restricted the development of all-solid-state lithium batteries. Herein, two different dynamic properties interlayers of electronically conductive Al and an electronically non-conductive Al2O3 are constructed at the Li/LLZO interface, and the lithium dendrite growth mechanism is explored. Results show that battery with Al interlayer occur internal short circuit in 95 cycles, while the battery with annealed Al2O3 interlayer has good cycle stability of 1000 cycles with polarization voltage below 0.1 V. Besides, dendritic lithium dendrites can be clearly observed at the LLZO grain boundaries of battery with Al interlayer. Raman and XPS results show that the Al2O3 interlayer reacts with Li+ during the charge and discharge process to form a Li-Al-O compound which is Li+ conductive. It is concluded that the lithium dendrite inhibition mechanism of the Li-Al-O compound interlayer is that it can promote the Li+ conduction from LLZO to lithium anode to undergo a lithium deposition reaction, and prevents electrons from conducting to LLZO and combine with Li+ to occur lithium dendrite growth. While for the Al interlayer, electrons can reach LLZO through the interlayer to combine with Li+ thus occurring the lithium dendritic growth.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.163908
Study of thermal material properties for Ta- and Al-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid-state electrolyte in dependency of temperature and grain size,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistrySolid-state electrolytes such as tantalum (Ta)- and aluminum (Al)-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) are seen as the key component for the next generation of mainstream battery technology. However, this development often lacks specific information on decisive material parameters. Therefore, this work experimentally investigates the thermal material parameters such as the thermal conductivity (κ) and the specific heat capacity (Cp) of LLZO between room temperature and 1225 K using laser flash analysis (LFA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC measurements reveal a Cp of 0.55-0.80 J g−1 K−1. Furthermore, a decomposition of the cubic LLZO phase to pyrochlore La2Zr2O7 is detected between 1500 K and 1750 K, which is substantiated by Raman- and SEM-analysis. The impact of the grain size on κ is also considered, as the Al-substitution leads to the formation of significantly larger grain sizes compared to a Ta-substitution. The LFA measurements yield a relatively constant κ between 1.45-1.55 W m−1 K−1 for both materials and grain sizes, which is the consequence of a phonon mean free path in the range of the interatomic distance of the LLZO crystal. This implies that phonon scattering at grain boundaries is negligible and the main scattering occurs at inhomogeneities in the crystal lattice.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta00323f
"Halogenation of Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolytes: a combined solid-state NMR, computational and electrochemical study","© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryGarnet-based solid electrolytes have been proposed as promising candidates for next generation all-solid-state batteries. Whilst multiple cation substitution studies of these garnets have been undertaken to try and improve their overall performance, anion doping of garnets has rarely been attempted, owing to the synthetic challenges associated with this particular doping strategy. In this work, we present the halogenation (F, Cl) of the solid state electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) via a low temperature solid state synthetic route using PTFE and PVC polymers. A reduction in tetragonal distortion (F incorporation) and a tetragonal to cubic phase transition (Cl incorporation) is observed in halogenated LLZO, suggesting the replacement of O2− with F− or Cl− is associated with the creation of lithium vacancies. Combined solid-state NMR and computational studies support the presence of F− or Cl− in halogenated LLZO. The effects of surface fluorination were also investigated for Al-doped LLZO (Li6.4Al0.2La3Zr2O12, LLAZO) with the results suggesting that this strategy has the ability to prevent full dendrite penetration at high current densities (up to 10 mA cm−2).",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta07309e
Experimental and theoretical study on enhanced electrochemistry of aluminum substitution LLZO garnet solid electrolytes,"© 2022 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.Although the wider electrochemical window, higher temperature stability, and better battery safety of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) electrolytes than organic liquid, organogels, and polyelectrolytes, the limited ionic conductivity still far away from the practical electrochemical applications. Herein, LLZO electrolytes were by solid phase method. In order to further improve its electrochemical performance, aluminum substitution was introduced to replace Li+ sites and thus the highly conductive cubic phase was stabilized. The results show that with the increase of the substitution amount, the ion conductivity presents a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. It was found that 0.15Al-LLZO ceramics presented optimized ionic conductivity (1.184 × 10-4 S·cm-1) and 92.5% of bulk density at 1150 °C for 21 h treatment. On the other hand, with the combination of molecular simulations, the relationship between the influence of aluminum substitution on the differential charge density of the garnet solid electrolyte and the electrochemical performance was investigated. It is believed that such an experimental-modeling combination will expand the fundamental understanding of elements variation/substitution effects on solid electrolytes, especially for lithium metal oxides.",Materials Research Express,10.1088/2053-1591/ac672e
Review - Electrospun Inorganic Solid-State Electrolyte Fibers for Battery Applications,"© 2022 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS""). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.Inorganic solid-state electrolytes (SSEs), especially Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), are promising candidates for all solid-state batteries. Generally, SSEs are synthesized by solid-state reactions at high temperatures. The high temperature required to synthesize useful polymorphs (e.g., cubic phase, in the case of LLZO) increases their production cost. To lower the synthesis temperature, several approaches, including doping and crystallite size control via sol-gel processes, have been explored. Recently, electrospinning was used to synthesize the inorganic SSE fibers to control the crystallite size and lower the calcination temperature. Several publications followed that investigated the properties of fibers and demonstrated the use of these fibers in inorganic-polymer composite SSEs. This paper presents a concise discussion of electrospinning, the parameters that control fiber morphology, the synthesis of inorganic SSE fibers, the effect of sintering conditions on the fiber morphology and composition, and the recent use of these fibers in making composite SSEs and other battery applications. Most of the discussion focuses on LLZO, but this paper also discusses applications of other types of electrospun inorganic electrolyte fibers, the challenges of using these fibers, and possible future directions in this research field.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1149/1945-7111/ac6c1c
Comparative Study of Stability against Moisture for Solid Garnet Electrolytes with Different Dopants,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The cubic garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO) is one of the most promising solid electrolytes due to its high ionic conductivity and large electrochemical window. However, the critical issue of Li2CO3 formation on the c-LLZO surface when exposed to air is problematic, which is detrimental to the ionic conductivity and storage. Herein, comparative studies were carried out on the air stability of Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Al-LLZO), Al-Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Al-LLZTO), and Al-Nb-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Al-LLZNO). It was found that Al-LLZTO and Al-LLZNO are less reactive with air than Al-LLZO. The morphology of Li2CO3 on Al-LLZTO micro-sized powders after air exposure was island-like with ~1.5 µm in thickness. The interfacial resistance of Li/Al-LLZTO was also a factor of ~3 smaller than that of Li/Al-LLZO, leading to the improved cycle stability of Li/Al-LLZTO/Li symmetric cells. The first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) verified that the decomposition energy of Al-LLZTO was larger than that of Al-LLZO, inhibiting the reaction product of Li2O and, thus, the next step product of Li2CO3 following the reactions of Li2O + H2O → LiOH and LiOH + CO2 → Li2CO3 .",Energies,10.3390/en15093206
An Investigation of Chemo-Mechanical Phenomena and Li Metal Penetration in All-Solid-State Lithium Metal Batteries Using In Situ Optical Curvature Measurements,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Solid-electrolytes (SEs) can provide a pathway to increase energy-density in lithium metal batteries. However, lithium metal penetration through garnet based LLZO solid electrolytes has been identified as a critical failure process. This phenomenon is related to chemo-mechanical processes which are difficult to probe. In particular, characterizing the dynamic mechanical deformations that occur in electrode-SE structures is very challenging. This study reports in situ curvature measurements that are thus designed to probe chemo-mechanical phenomena that occur during lithium plating. The novel experimental cell configuration created for this work shows that pressure builds up in the Li metal during plating, up until the point where short circuits occur. The resulting data are analyzed with a detailed finite element model (FEM) to quantitatively evaluate stress evolution. The results show that Li metal plating within a surface flaw can produce stress build-up prior to short-circuiting. The combined results from both the experiments and the FEM suggest that it is critical to minimize surface defects and flaws during the manufacturing processes.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202200369
Solid-state lithium battery with garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 nanofibers composite polymer electrolytes,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In recent years, solid-state lithium-ion batteries with high safety and excellent performance have become a research hotspot.

Garnet ceramic fabric-reinforced flexible composite solid electrolyte derived from silk template for safe and long-term stable All-Solid-State lithium metal batteries,"© 2022All-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) using solid electrolytes are considered the most promising candidate for next-generation lithium-ion batteries owing to their high energy density and safety. However, the low ionic conductivity and limited electrochemical windows of the solid electrolytes limit the practical applications of ASSLBs. Herein, we demonstrate a simple and scalable method to prepare a solid electrolyte consisting of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramic fabric by using silk as the template to form a sandwich-structured garnet LLZO ceramic fabric composite solid electrolyte (LLZO CF-CSE). The flexible LLZO CF-CSE shows remarkable thermostability and electrochemical stability (wide electrochemical window of 5.1 V vs. Li+/Li). The lithium symmetrical battery fabricated using LLZO CF-CSE can stably cycle without short circuit for 700 h at 50 °C. The ASSLB based on LiFePO4 cathode delivers high reversible capacity and excellent cycle stability at 50 °C (149.3 mAh g − 1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, and 107.2 mAh g − 1 after 500 cycles at 1 C). In addition, the flexible lithium metal pouch battery operates safely and stably under extreme conditions.

In-situ constructed lithium-salt lithiophilic layer inducing bi-functional interphase for stable LLZO/Li interface,"© 2022Solid-state lithium (Li) metal battery is promising for next-generation battery systems due to its high safety and expected high energy density. Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) with superior ionic conductivity and excellent stability with Li stands out among numerous solid electrolytes, yet the poor interfacial contact and the growth of dendrites hinder its application. Herein, a lithium-salt lithiophilic layer with nano-porous structure is constructed on the garnet surface by using H3BO3 aqueous solution and HF vapor. The violent reaction of lithium-salt layer with Li coupled with capillary force from nano-porous layer give rise to superior lithiophilicity, which greatly improves the wettability of LLZO with molten Li, thereby reducing the interfacial impedance to ∼9 Ω cm2. The interfacial reaction induces bi-functional interphase with electronically insulation and high surface energy, which can block the electron transport at the interface and guide the horizontal deposition of lithium, thus effectively suppressing the Li dendrites. With above effects, a stable LLZO/Li interface is obtained with an improved critical current density (CCD) of ∼2 mA cm−2 and excellent cycling stability for 1200 h at 0.5 mA cm−2 at 25 ℃. And the solid batteries with LiFePO4 or LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode display excellent long-term cycling performance and can work normally at 1.2 mA cm−2 at 25 ℃.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.01.046
Modeling the effect of electrolyte microstructure on conductivity and solid-state Li-ion battery performance,"© 2022 The AuthorsSolid-state batteries offer the potential to improve safety, cyclability, and energy density of Li-ion batteries. However, their conductivity, stability, and processing limit their use. To this end, the effects of solid electrolyte microstructure on overall battery performance are determined. The conductivities of Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Al-LLZO), with a range of microstructures, are found using a resistor network model. Varying electrolyte properties are combined with a Li-metal negative electrode and LiCoO2 positive electrode in a 1-D continuum model to predict the effects on performance. Simulations suggest that the ratio of electrolyte conductivity to electrolyte thickness must remain above 10 S m−2 to maintain high energy and power output, particularly at C-rates greater than 10. To maintain conductivity near the grain interior conductivity, a grain size at least 10,000 times larger than grain boundary thickness is needed. Further improvements in grain size, grain boundary thickness, and void fraction beyond typical Al-LLZO microstructures, with the goal of higher conductivities, are predicted to have diminishing returns in overall battery performance, even at more sensitive high C-rates up to 100.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231177
Combining Organic Plastic Salts with a Bicontinuous Electrospun PVDF-HFP/Li7La3Zr2O12Membrane: LiF-Rich Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Enabling Stable Solid-State Lithium Metal Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Solid-state electrolytes can guarantee the safe operation of high-energy density lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, major challenges still persist with LMBs due to the use of solid electrolytes, that is, poor ionic conductivity and poor compatibility at the electrolyte/electrode interface, which reduces the operational stability of solid-state LMBs. Herein, a novel fiber-network-reinforced composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) was designed by combining an organic plastic salt (OPS) with a bicontinuous electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP)/Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) membrane. The presence of LLZO in the composite helps to promote the dissociation of FSI-from OPSs. Subsequently, the dissociated FSI-is then involved in the formation of a LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the lithium anode via a reductive decomposition reaction, which was affirmed by theoretical calculations and experimental results. Due to the LiF-rich SEI layer, the Li/Li symmetric cell was able to demonstrate a long cyclic life of over 2600 h at a current density of 0.1 mA cm-2. More importantly, the as-prepared CPE achieved a high ionic conductivity of 2.8 × 10-4S cm-1at 25 °C, and the Li/LiFePO4cell based on the CPE exhibited a high discharge capacity and 83.3% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1.0 C. Thus, the strategy proposed in this work can inspire the future development of highly conductive solid electrolytes and compatible interface designs toward high-energy density solid-state LMBs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c02952
Storage of Garnet Solid Electrolytes: Insights into Air Stability and Surface Chemistry,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) have been widely considered as an ""enabler""for the next-generation high-energy density batteries and simultaneously solve the safety issues of liquid lithium-ion batteries. Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is one of the most promising solid electrolyte (SE) materials for SSLMBs. In the past decade, great advances for LLZO have been achieved in terms of material preparation, cation dopants and substitutions, ion conductivity, ion transport mechanisms, and interface engineering, but relatively little attention was focused on its air stability. This issue is of equal importance as it plays a key role in LLZO storage, processing, and practical applications in SSLMBs. A thorough understanding of the origin of its instability and the properties of the air passivation layer (APL) may provide guidance for developing strategies to simplify cell assembly and improve the quality of the SE/Li interface. This study aimed to investigate the air stability-related characteristics of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO), including the properties of the APL, and the origin of instability and air passivation mechanism. Fifteen-level X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling and thermogravimetric analysis reveal that LiOH·xH2O, Li2CO3, and Li6.4-xHxLa3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 are the main contaminants in the APL, and the contents increased with exposure time. LiOH·xH2O originating from the Li+/H+ exchange reaction is an important intermediate for APL formation. A feasible heat treatment at 700 °C for 3 h has been demonstrated to be an effective and simple method to completely remove the surficial APL. Our findings broaden the understanding of the air stability of LLZTO and head for practical applications of garnet-based SSLMBs. In addition, this systematic methodology may inspire fresh investigations of air stability-related issues for broader solid electrolytes.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.2c00452
Lithium Nafion-Modified Li6.05Ga0.25La3Zr2O11.8F0.2Trilayer Hybrid Solid Electrolyte for High-Voltage Cathodes in All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.All-solid-state batteries containing ceramic-polymer solid electrolytes are possible alternatives to lithium-metal batteries containing liquid electrolytes in terms of their safety, energy storage, and stability at elevated temperatures. In this study we prepared a garnet-type Li6.05Ga0.25La3Zr2O11.8F0.2(LGLZOF) solid electrolyte modified with lithium Nafion (LiNf) and incorporated it into poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) matrixes. We used a solution-casting method to obtain bilayer (Bi-HSE) and trilayer (Tri-HSE) hybrid solid electrolytes. A layer of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs) coated with LiNf (LiNf@f-MWCNT) in the Tri-HSE led to good compatibility with the polymer slurry and adhered well to the Li anode, thereby improving the interfacial contact at the electrode-solid electrolyte interface and suppressing dendrite growth. The Tri-HSE membrane displayed high ionic conductivity (5.6 × 10-4S cm-1at 30 °C), a superior Li+transference number (0.87), and a wide electrochemical window (0-5.0 V vs Li/Li+). In addition, Li symmetrical cells incorporating this hybrid electrolyte possessed excellent interfacial stability over 600 h at 0.1 mA cm-2and a high critical current density (1.5 mA cm-2).

All Solid-State Li/LLZO/LCO Battery Enabled by Alumina Interfacial Coating,"© 2022 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS""). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet-Type lithium-ion conductors are being investigated as a promising solid electrolyte for solid-state lithium batteries. To enable a functional all-solid-state configuration intensive investigations are needed to reduce the cathode/ electrolyte interfacial resistance which contributes the most to cell performance loss. Among the commercial cathode materials investigated so far, LiCoO2 (LCO) is one of the most stable with garnet electrolytes as only a superficial reaction has been detected between the two materials. However, even this minor reaction would block the Li-ion transport through the interface, resulting in deteriorated cell performance. In this work, we demonstrate that a thin aluminum oxide layer (5 nm) can be an effective interlayer to impede the formation of a harmful interphase and enable facile Li-ion transfer between LCO and the LLZO garnet. Roomtemperature-sputtered LCO thin films were employed to form an interface with the garnet electrolyte and annealed at 800 °C to reveal the effect of the interfacial reaction on the Li-ion transfer across the interface. An aluminum oxide layer was then introduced between LCO and the garnet electrolyte by sputtering a metallic aluminum layer which is then annealed together with the upper LCO layer in oxygen, or by direct atomic layer deposition of the oxide. Compared to the LCO/LLZO/Li cells without an aluminum oxide interlayer, those with the interlayer exhibited improved performance, i.e., a stable discharge capacity of up to 90 mAh/(g LCO) at a C/10 rate, a rate capability up to 1.68C and a stable galvanostatic cycling at 0.1C for over 100 cycles with a discharge capacity fade rate of 0.15% per cycle. It was determined that aluminum diffused into the LCO layer after preventing the initial detrimental reaction between LCO and the LLZO garnet from happening during high temperature annealing, suggesting that the coating does not have to remain a physically blocking layer during cycling to function.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1149/1945-7111/ac644f
"Li sublattice and diffusive response to uniaxial loads in the solid electrolyte, Li7La2Zr3O12 (LLZO)","© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe polymorphism of the garnet solid electrolyte, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), is a critical facet of the material's performance and viability as an electrolyte candidate. Indeed, the cubic polymorph has an ionic conductivity several orders of magnitude higher than the tetragonal polymorph. While the transition from tetragonal to cubic LLZO has been reported over a range of temperatures, the response of the material to asymmetrical mechanical loads is not fully understood. To fill the knowledge gap, this paper conducted classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the diffusive response of LLZO under uniaxial stress conditions at 1000 K. It is found that the transition from cubic to tetragonal LLZO occurs around 500 MPa in compression and 750 MPa in tension. Near these threshold stresses, the Li sublattice undergoes a smooth transition from a cubic-like arrangement of interstitial occupancies to a tetragonal-like arrangement, with the occupancies of 24d and 96h interstitial sites decreasing and increasing respectively as the stress increases. The activation energy for diffusion increases with both tension and compression, increasing at a rate of 39 × 10−6 and 7 × 10−6 eV/MPa in compression and tension respectively.",Extreme Mechanics Letters,10.1016/j.eml.2022.101671
Improved Li-Ion conduction by ion-conductor Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 additive in garnet type Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolytes,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this study, Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) was introduced as a sintering aid up to 4 wt % into the garnet type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) structure. Results pointed out that increasing LAGP amount improved densification and electrochemical performance comparing with pure LLZO. But, LAGP addition facilitated the open pore formation and cracking occurred eventually. 1 wt % LAGP containing LLZO was optimized as they show the best electrolytic properties with 0.78 mS/cm ionic conductivity and 1.25 × 10−7 S/cm electronic conductivity without suffering from the open pore formation. LAGP added LLZO samples exhibited one of the lowest activation energies around 0.17 eV when compared to the pure LLZO (0.24 eV) as LAGP stayed between LLZO grains and maintain the continuous ion-conductive pathway. Considering all of the findings, the study offers a new approach to obtain bulk type LLZO solid electrolytes with the lowest activation energy thanks to the intergranular ion conduction.",Materials Chemistry and Physics,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2022.125910
Avoiding CO2 Improves Thermal Stability at the Interface of Li7La3Zr2O12 Electrolyte with Layered Oxide Cathodes,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Energy Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Solid-state batteries promise higher energy densities and better safety than Li-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes. However, the interface between solid electrolyte and cathode is unstable at the elevated temperatures that are needed while sintering to achieve good bonding between ceramic components. Here, the hypothesis is that, the gas environment, especially the presence of CO2, is critical in determining the stability of the solid electrolyte–cathode interface. The effect of gas species on the interface is systematically probed, by a using Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte with a thin film LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 cathode as a model system to enable interface sensitivity. Detrimental phases formed at the interface and their onset conditions are identified by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Gibbs free energy analysis. As a result, removing CO2 and minimizing H2O(g) during sintering is necessary to obtain good contact at the LLZO|cathode interface without forming secondary phases. Sintering in O2 is ideal, yielding excellent chemical stability and low interfacial resistance. Secondary phases also do not form in N2, but oxygen loss occurs at elevated temperatures. The interfacial resistance obtained upon sintering in pure O2 is comparable to the lowest values at LLZO interfaces with protective coatings, but here without the need for interface coatings.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202102741
An oxygen vacancy-rich ZnO layer on garnet electrolyte enables dendrite-free solid state lithium metal batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The huge interfacial resistance caused by Li2CO3 on garnet (LLZO) electrolyte and the lithium-dendrite growth through garnet greatly hinder the development of solid-state batteries (SSBs). Here, both the problems are simultaneously addressed through a general strategy of engineering garnet pellet with a layer of ZnO with oxygen vacancies (OV-ZnO). The OV-ZnO not only protects LLZO from being exposed to wet air, but also reacts spontaneously with lithium-metal to in-situ form an ionic conducting LixZnO interphase. The as-formed interphase improves the Li/LLZO contact, reduces the huge interface resistance caused by Li2CO3, suppresses the lithium-dendrite growth, and promotes the lithium transport between LLZO and Li-metal. As a result, an Li/Li symmetric cell with OV-ZnO coated LLZO pellet shows a low area specific resistance of 55 Ω cm2, a stable plating/stripping process for 200 h at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2, and a record-high critical current density of 1.4 mA cm−2 ever reported at room temperature. Moreover, this approach of coating metal oxide with oxygen vacancies on garnet electrolytes has been extended to other metal oxides, such as copper oxide (OV-CuO), titanium dioxide (OV-TiO2) and indium oxide (OV-In2O3).",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.133665
Reducing Impedance at a Li-Metal Anode/Garnet-Type Electrolyte Interface Implementing Chemically Resolvable in Layers,"© The Authors. Published by 2022 American Chemical Society.Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a potential electrolyte material for all-solid-state Li-ion batteries mainly because of its reported excellent chemical stability in contact with Li metal. But good wettability of LLZO and 100% surface coverage of lithium are still a challenge. This study elucidated the suitability of magnetron-sputtered indium in Li(In)/LLZO/Li(In) symmetrical model cells as one of the promising interfacial modifications reported in the literature. Importance was given to the impact of preparation parameters on the surface coverage of Li(In)/LLZO interfaces and the consequences of impedance, cycling stability, and critical current density. SEM and EDXS analyses of In layers of thickness 100 nm to 1 μm revealed complete dissolution of indium in the lithium anode after annealing; 300 nm In layers annealed at 220 °C/10 h provided a surface coverage of >80%, best reproducibility, and a supreme interface resistance Rint of 12.4 ω·cm2. Presuming a surface coverage of 100%, an ultimate interface resistance close to 1 ω·cm2 can be expected. The critical current density was determined as 200-500 μA/cm2 at a charge of 100-250 μAh, whereas 500 μA/cm2 and above affected cell stability. The increasing voltage plateau was assigned to the increase of the interface resistance Rint and the electrolyte resistance RG+GB. SEM, EDXS, and X-ray microtomography analyses after voltage breakdown confirmed Li-dendrite growth along grain boundaries into LLZO, often curved parallel to the interface, indicating short-circuiting of the solid electrolyte. Grain boundary characteristics are supposed to be decisive for lithium deposition in and failure of garnet-type solid electrolytes after cycling.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c25257
Structural Features and the Li-Ion Diffusion Mechanism in Tantalum-Doped Li7La3Zr2O12Solid Electrolytes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Solid electrolytes with high values of lithium-ion conductivity are required for the creation of high-energy lithium and lithium-ion power sources, and compounds with a garnet structure based on Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) are one of the candidate materials for this purpose. In the present work, solid electrolytes of the Li7-xLa3Zr2-xTaxO12system with x = 0.0-2.0 were synthesized using the sol-gel method. According to X-ray diffraction analysis, all of the compounds with x ≥ 0.1 have the same cubic modification with the space group Ia3¯ d. However, an increase in Ta concentration affects the short-range order crystal structure of these materials, resulting in higher local distortions, which was shown by pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. Particularly, the PDF data indicate an increase in the probability of Li ions to locally occupy not only two typical positions, Li1─96 h and Li2─24 d, but also a third one, Li3─48 g. The maximum value of lithium-ion conductivity in the studied system was observed for the Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12compound (i.e., x = 0.6) and had the value of 1.4 × 10-4S cm-1at 25 °C. This is consistent with the results of density functional theory (DFT) modeling, which confirmed that a moderate Ta-doping (up to x < 1.0) is most suitable for enhancing Li diffusion in LLZO materials. A combination of DFT modeling, structural characterization of the short and average structures, and conductivity measurements in this work allowed getting insight into this important class of Li-conducting oxides and ideas on improving their properties.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.1c03632
Li2CO3: Insights into Its Blocking Effect on Li-Ion Transfer in Garnet Composite Electrolytes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) has been widely used as a filler in composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) to achieve high-performance solid-state batteries (SSBs). Unfortunately, moisture-sensitive LLZO suffers from surface Li2CO3passivation when being exposed to an ambient atmosphere. The insulated Li2CO3layer is thought to reduce the Li+transportability of CSEs. However, further studies are still needed to find out the underlying mechanism, which helps to guide future filler modification and electrolyte design. Herein, the role of the Li2CO3layer in CSEs is elucidated from different perspectives. The passivate Li2CO3layer is verified to prohibit the formation of the high conductive interlayer, change the Li+transport pathway, and decrease the carrier concentration in CSEs. Also, the Li2CO3layer would reduce the electropositivity of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12(LLZTO) particles, which therefore weakens the anchoring effect toward bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI)-. Accordingly, without Li2CO3, the electrolyte of polyethylene oxide/LiTFSI/IL (ionic liquid) with LLZTO-AT (PLILA) displays 2 times higher ionic conductivity and an improved Li+transference number of 0.49. Additionally, an excellent cycling performance is presented in Li symmetric cells and full cells with PLLA. This work provides a novel perspective for future research on lithium-ion transport mechanisms and inspires designing better-performance SSBs.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.1c03529
Crystal structure and morphology of B-Al doped-lithium lantanum zirconate,"© 2022 Author(s).Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid Li ion conductor is a promising solid electrolyte for the all-solid-state Li-ion batteries (ASSLIB) because of its appropriate ionic conductivity and its good electrochemical stability. The previous research on B doping into LLZO structure proven to decrease the sintering temperature because B serve as a sintering agent. Meanwhile, Al doping into LLZO structure is known to increase the ionic conductivity of this solid electrolyte. Consider those previous results, this research combined B and Al doping into LLZO which was conducted through solid state reaction under a various composition of B and Al. The synthesis result was then analyzed by XRD, SEM/EDX to understand its characteristic of the diffraction pattern, crystal structure, surface morphology of the sintered- pellets and also the elements content inside. The result found that the B-Al doped-LLZO are still in similar cubic structure with a space group of Ia-3d. The cubic phase is the main composition with mol percentage of around 82 %, and the rest are secondary phases. The pellet of materials can be sintered well, however due to its hygroscopic properties, the pellets turned into powder after 12 h store under room condition. Therefore, the dry atmosphere is required to further analyzed such as to measure the electrical conductivity and to assembly the materials into a battery prototype.",AIP Conference Proceedings,10.1063/5.0072447
Enhanced critical current density of Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte by incorporation of LiBr,"© 2022Cubic garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolytes have a strong potential to allow solid-state lithium-ion to become the next-generation energy storage systems and for addressing the safety issues. However, the applications of LLZO solid electrolytes are seriously limited by the relatively low critical current density of LLZO. In this study, we introduce lithium bromide (LiBr) with a low melting point as the sintering aid to prepare a high-performance garnet with high ionic conductivity, high relative density, and excellent critical current density. The prepared LLZO solid electrolyte with a LiBr concentration of 0.15 (xLiBr–LLZO with x = 0.15 mol) exhibited a high ionic conductivity of 7.62 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 ℃ with an excellent relative density of 96.27%. The critical current density (CCD) of the symmetric Li | 0.15LiBr–LLZO | Li cell was 1.0 mA cm−2 at 25 ℃. Furthermore, this cell can stably operate for 1000 h under a current density of 0.3 mA cm−2. In addition, quasi-solid-state batteries of Li | LiFePO4 with 0.15LiBr–LLZO electrolyte delivered excellent capacity retention (141.1 mAh g−1; ∼89.7%) after 300 cycles, excellent rate performance, high coulombic efficiency and cycling stability. Furthermore, Li | LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 with 0.15LiBr–LLZO electrolyte could run normally with high coulombic efficiency (>99%). These research results show that the solid-state batteries developed using 0.15LiBr–LLZO electrolyte are highly promising for the practical applications.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.139986
Ionic liquid-containing cathodes empowering ceramic solid electrolytes,"© 2022 The Author(s)Although ceramic solid electrolytes, such as Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), are promising candidates to replace conventional liquid electrolytes for developing safe and high-energy-density solid-state Li-metal batteries, the large interfacial resistance between cathodes and ceramic solid electrolytes severely limits their practical application. Here we developed an ionic liquid (IL)-containing while nonfluidic quasi-solid-state LiCoO2 (LCO) composite cathode, which can maintain good contact with an Al-doped LLZO (Al-LLZO) ceramic electrolyte. Accordingly the interfacial resistance between LCO and Al-LLZO was significantly decreased. Quasi-solid-state LCO/Al-LLZO/Li cells demonstrated relatively high capacity retention of about 80% after 100 cycles at 60°C. The capacity decay was mainly because of the instability of the IL. Nevertheless, the IL-containing LCO cathode enabled the use of Al-LLZO as a solid electrolyte in a simple and practical way. Identifying a suitable IL is critical for the development of quasi-solid-state Li-metal batteries with a ceramic solid electrolyte.",iScience,10.1016/j.isci.2022.103896
"Review of modification strategies in emerging inorganic solid-state electrolytes for lithium, sodium, and potassium batteries","© 2022The design of solid-state electrolyte (SSE) entails controlling not only its bulk structure but also the internal (e.g., grain boundary and pore) and heterophase (e.g., anode-SSE reaction layer) interfaces. Moreover, defects are integral for establishing both the initial all-solid-state battery (ASSB) cell performance and its ultimate cycling lifetime. This topical review discusses 5 highly promising inorganic lithium-, sodium-, and potassium-based SSEs, providing case studies of strategies to enhance ionic conductivity, tune the internal and heterophase interfaces, and prevent dendrites and deleterious side reactions. The primary focus is on garnet LLZO (Li7La3Zr2O12), argyrodite (Li6AS5X, A = P, Sb and X = Cl, Br, I), Na3AB4 (A = P, Sb, As and B = S, Se), and NASICON-type electrolytes, with several exploratory potassium systems being presented as well. The article begins with a discussion of the superionic conduction mechanisms, which is assisted by defects, topology, correlation, and disorder. The discussion then shifts to the thermodynamic or kinetic phase stability of metastable SSEs, followed by the SSE internal interfaces (pores and grain boundaries), and finally the complex microstructure associated with the reactive boundaries between the SSE and the metal anode and the SSE and the high-voltage ceramic cathode. This review explores why SSE systems with highly promising bulk ionic conductivity values do not demonstrate comparable performance in full cells. A major cause is the cycling-induced formation of ionically insulating but electrically conducting new phases at both the anode and the cathode. For the SSEs that do not rapidly decompose when contacting the anode, site-specific variations in ionic conductivity/electrical resistivity lead to growth of metal dendrites. In each electrolyte class, creative fabrication strategies have been employed to minimize, but not fully eliminate, new phase formation and dendrites, creating ample opportunities for additional analytical and synthesis-focused research. The emphasis of the discussion is on the bulk doping strategies for SSEs, emerging simulation and characterization findings in relation to SSE performance and cell failure, and new synthesis approaches and cell architectures to improve cycling stability. Throughout the article, outstanding scientific questions are identified, and future research directions are proposed.",Joule,10.1016/j.joule.2022.01.015
Simultaneously Improved Cubic Phase Stability and Li-Ion Conductivity in Garnet-Type Solid Electrolytes Enabled by Controlling the Al Occupation Sites,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Here, we, for the first time, report on the simultaneous enhancement in cubic phase stability and Li-ion conductivity of garnet-type solid electrolytes (SEs) by adding excess Li/Al. The excess Al/Li creates very large grains of up to 170 μm via the segregation of Al at the grain boundaries and enables preferential Al occupation at 96h sites over 24d sites, a behavior contrary to previous observations. The resulting SE shows improved Li-ion conductivity due to the large grain size and less blocking Li pathway caused by different preferential Al occupation. Surprisingly, it is observed that the cubic phase of the garnet-type SE is transformed to the tetragonal phase on the surface and in the bulk under the applied voltage, and the preferential Al occupation enables its cubic phase stability. Under battery operating conditions, the LLZO SE with excess Li/Al can maintain high ionic conductivity due to the cubic phase stability and large grain size. We clearly demonstrate that the cubic phase stability and ionic conductivity of LLZO can be simultaneously improved by excess Li/Al without any post-treatments. The findings and understanding will provide new insights into practical use of the garnet-type SEs for advanced all solid-state batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c01361
Study of LiCoO2/Li7La3Zr2O12:Ta Interface Degradation in All-Solid-State Lithium Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyThe garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramic solid electrolyte combines high Li-ion conductivity at room temperature with high chemical stability. Several all-solid-state Li batteries featuring the LLZO electrolyte and the LiCoO2 (LCO) or LiCoO2-LLZO composite cathode were demonstrated. However, all batteries exhibit rapid capacity fading during cycling, which is often attributed to the formation of cracks due to volume expansion and the contraction of LCO. Excluding the possibility of mechanical failure due to crack formation between the LiCoO2/LLZO interface, a detailed investigation of the LiCoO2/LLZO interface before and after cycling clearly demonstrated cation diffusion between LiCoO2 and the LLZO. This electrochemically driven cation diffusion during cycling causes the formation of an amorphous secondary phase interlayer with high impedance, leading to the observed capacity fading. Furthermore, thermodynamic analysis using density functional theory confirms the possibility of low- or non-conducting secondary phases forming during cycling and offers an additional explanation for the observed capacity fading. Understanding the presented degradation paves the way to increase the cycling stability of garnet-based all-solid-state Li batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c22246
Effect of LiOH on Tantalum Doped Li7La3Zr2O12 Garnet Solid Electrolyte LiOH对Ta掺杂石榴石型Li7La3Zr2O12固体电解质的影响,"© 2022, Editorial Department of Journal of the Chinese Ceramic Society.

The effect of LiOH on the microstructure and ionic conductivity of Ta-LLZO ceramics was investigated. The results show that LiOH as a lithium source can promote the formation of cubic Ta-LLZO,and LiOH as a sintering additive can effectively improve the densification of ceramics. The dense cubic garnet Ta-LLZO ceramics were obtained by sintering at 1 200 ℃ for 5 h. When the amount of the sintering additive is 6% (in mass fraction), the ionic conductivity of ceramics reaches 6.23×10-4 S•cm-1.

Towards Recycling of LLZO Solid Electrolyte Exemplarily Performed on LFP/LLZO/LTO Cells**,"© 2022 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.All-solid-state lithium ion batteries (ASS-LIBs) are promising due to their safety and higher energy density as compared to that of conventional LIBs. Over the next few decades, tremendous amounts of spent ASS-LIBs will reach the end of their cycle life and would require recycling in order to address the waste management issue along with reduced exploitation of rare elements. So far, only very limited studies have been conducted on recycling of ASS-LIBS. Herein, we investigate the recycling of the Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid-state electrolyte in a LiFePO4/LLZO/Li4Ti5O12 system using a hydrometallurgical approach. Our results show that different concentration of the leaching solutions can significantly influence the final product of the recycling process.

Grain-boundary fracture mechanisms in Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolytes: When phase transformation acts as a temperature-dependent toughening mechanism,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdGarnet-type, solid electrolytes, such as Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), are a promising alternative to liquid electrolytes for lithium-metal batteries. However, such solid-electrolyte materials frequently exhibit undesirable lithium (Li) metal plating and fracture along grain boundaries. In this study, we employ atomistic simulations to investigate the mechanisms and key fracture properties associated with intergranular fracture along one such boundary. Our results show that, in the case of a Σ5(310) grain boundary, this boundary exhibits brittle fracture behavior, i.e. the absence of dislocation activity ahead of the propagating crack tip, accompanied with a decrease in work of separation, peak stress, and maximum stress intensity factor as the temperature increases from 300 K to 1500 K. As the crack propagates, we predict two temperature-dependent Li clustering regimes. For temperatures at or below 900 K, Li tends to cluster in the bulk region away from the crack plane driven by a void-coalescence mechanism concomitant a simultaneous cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition. The tetragonalization of LLZO in this temperature regime acts as an emerging toughening mechanism. At higher temperatures, this phase transition mechanism is suppressed leading to a more uniform distribution of Li throughout the grain-boundary system and lower fracture properties as compared to lower temperatures.",Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids,10.1016/j.jmps.2022.104791
High ionic conductivity PEO-based electrolyte with 3D framework for Dendrite-free solid-state lithium metal batteries at ambient temperature,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Solid-state lithium metal batteries are one of the best candidates for the next generation of energy storage devices. However, their applications are greatly limited by low ionic conductivity at ambient temperature and poor interfacial compatibility of solid-state electrolytes. Herein, a novel composite solid-state electrolyte consisted of polyethylene oxide (PEO), aramid nanofibers (ANFs) and Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) was designed and prepared. The ANFs and PEO constructed a three-dimensional flexible framework by electrostatic attraction, and LLZO particles as Li+-conducting fillers were introduced into the polymer backbone. As a result, compared to the pure PEO host, the crystallinity of prepared electrolyte was remarkably decreased, and the ionic conductivity was increased to 1.36 mS cm−1 at 30 °C. LiFePO4/Li cells with the electrolyte delivered a high specific capacity of 152 mAh g−1 and the capacity retention was over 88 % after 400 cycles, and the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2/Li cell can stably operate 200 cycles at 0.5C under 30 °C. During cycling, a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was formed on the surface of lithium anode, inhibiting the formation of lithium dendrite and dead lithium, and improving the cyclic stability of the battery. Furthermore, the electrolyte exhibited satisfactory mechanical properties, high thermal stability, and good interfacial compatibility and stability with the lithium metal anode. This work could provide a reference for the development and practical application of solid-state lithium metal batteries at ambient temperature.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.133352
Competing Effects in the Hydration Mechanism of a Garnet-Type Li7La3Zr2O12 Electrolyte,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyLi-ion conducting oxides (Li7La3Zr2O12, LLZO) with a cubic garnet-type structure are among the most promising candidates to be used as solid electrolytes in all-solid-state Li batteries. However, the environmental instability of the electrolyte, induced by interaction between the material and gas molecules commonly found in air, namely, water and carbon dioxide, poses challenges for its manufacture and application. Herein, a combined experimental kinetic and thermodynamic study was performed as a function of temperature to clarify the mechanism of hydration of a garnet-type LLZO electrolyte in moist air. It was found that the kinetics of LLZO hydration is diffusion-limited and the hydration mechanism at room temperature and at higher temperatures differs. The hydration of LLZO increases up to 200 °C. Above this temperature, stagnation of water uptake is observed due to the onset of a competing dehydration process. The dehydration of LLZO takes place up to 400 °C. The partial pressure of water significantly affects the extent of hydration. Expanding this combined kinetic and thermodynamic approach to LLZO materials with a variety of chemical compositions and morphologies would allow prediction of their reactivity in a humid atmosphere and adjustment of the processing conditions accordingly to meet the requirements of technological applications.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c02581
Interfacial Barrier of Ion Transport in Poly(ethylene oxide)-Li7La3Zr2O12 Composite Electrolytes Illustrated by 6Li-Tracer Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyFundamental understanding of the lithium-ion transport mechanism in polymer-inorganic composite electrolyte is crucially important for the rational design of composite electrolytes for solid-state batteries. In this work, the Li+ ion transport pathway in a model composite electrolyte of PEO containing sparsely dispersed LLZO (PEO-LLZO) was studied by an advanced characterization technique, i.e., 6Li-tracer NMR spectroscopy. By analyzing the 6Li distribution within the PEO-LLZO composite at the end of the discharge of an electrochemical cell of 6Li | PEO-LLZO | stainless steel with a fixed capacity (less than the total amount of the Li+ in the composite) at various current densities, it is found that the interfacial barrier between LLZO and PEO could cause a reduced Li+ flux through LLZO, particularly at high current densities, and therefore plays a critical role in determining the Li+ transport pathway in the composite electrolyte. This work provides an intuitive picture of Li+ ion transport in a polymer-inorganic composite electrolyte that is helpful to optimize and design better composite electrolytes.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c04085
Plasma optimized Li7La3Zr2O12 with vertically aligned ion diffusion pathways in composite polymer electrolyte for stable solid-state lithium metal batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Composite solid-state electrolytes (CSSEs) are promising for high-energy–density solid-state lithium metal batteries for the integrated merits of high ionic conductivity of inorganic fillers and intimate interfical contact introduced by soft polymeric matrix. However, the Li+ diffusion in the garnet based CSSEs is still unsatisfactory due to the non-conducting Li2CO3 layer on surface of the Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and the incontinuous ion diffusion pathways caused by the random distribution. Here we report a CSSE composed of Li2CO3-free LLZO nanoparticles by plasma treatment with vertically aligned structure (labelled as PLLZOV) in PVDF-HFP/PEO/LiTFSI (PPL) matrix. The removal of Li2CO3 along with the vertical alignment of LLZO enables the CSSE with more effective Li+ diffusion, delivering a higher ionic conductivity. Moreover, benefiting from the robust polymer matrix, the CSSE possesses excellent mechanical strength with good flexbility, making it effective in suppressing lithium dendrite growth and realizing good interfacial contact. Furthermore, the PLLZOV/PPL exhibits stable potential window up to 5.0 V vs Li/Li+. As a result, the solid-state lithium metal batteries assembled with PLLZOV/PPL achieve high capacities of 128.4 mA h·g−1 at 0.5C and 109.7 mA h·g−1 at 1.0C with LiFePO4 cathode and good cycle stability at 50 °C. This composite electrolyte engineering strategy provides a facile method for the preparation of high-performance CSSE and shows great application potential in solid-state lithium metal batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.132874
Free standing dual phase cathode tapes-scalable fabrication and microstructure optimization of garnet-based ceramic cathodes,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.To make ceramic based all-solid-state batteries competitive for the battery market, a shift from the separator supported cell-design for lab cells to a scalable, cathode-supported one is necessary to improve the energy density. Using tape casting, we were able to demonstrate for the first time all-ceramic free-standing LiCoO2 (LCO)/Li6.45Al0.05La3Zr1.6Ta0.4O12 (LLZO) mixed cathodes with high capacities and active material utilization. Further morphology engineering by introduction of a sequential layer casting enabled us to tailor the microstructure of the mixed cathodes resulting in opposite concentration gradients for the active material and the electrolyte over the thickness of the cathode. With this optimized microstructure, we were able to increase the discharge capacity of the free-standing mixed cathodes to 2.8 mA h cm-2 utilizing 99% of the theoretical capacity. For the oxide garnet-based system, both the scalable fabrication method and the achieved electrochemical performance demonstrates industrial relevance for the first time. Additionally, the obtained free-standing cathodes have sufficient mechanical stability to allow the application of hybrid and ultra-thin separators to further increase the energy density on the full cell level.

However, poor compatibility of organic parts and inorganic materials leads to quick capacity decay after long-term charge/discharging running because of inorganic/organic interface deterioration and thus, the related ineffective lithium-ion (Li+) conduction. Herein, a ""Boston ivy-style""method is proposed to prepare a solid ceramic/polymer hybrid electrolyte that exhibits a dense interface structure. After grafting on Dynasylan IMEO (DI), the modified LLZO NFs are used as ligands to bond with coordinatively unsaturated metal centers of Ca2+. Furthermore, these Ca2+ bridge the modified LLZO NFs with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) via the ether oxygen atoms they possess. The bridges built between the two phases, PEO and LLZO NFs, are effective to interface strengthening and guarantee rapid Li+ conduction even after 900 cycles. The PEO/LLZO NFs-DI-Ca2+/LiTFSI electrolyte shows a high Li+ transference number of 0.72 (60 °C). The Li||LiFePO4 cell delivers excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 70.8% after 900 cycles, 0.5 C) and rate performance. The bridge strategy is proved to be effective and probably a promotion to the application of ceramic polymer-based solid-state electrolytes.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c21131
The effect of aspect ratio on the mechanical behavior of Li metal in solid-state cells,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The Li metal anode is necessary for solid-state batteries to dramatically exceed the energy density of state-of-the-art conventional Li-ion batteries. To enable the Li metal anode, the mechanical properties of Li metal under compression in a commercially relevant cell configuration must be determined. This work examines the compression creep behavior of Li metal coupled with a relevant model solid-state electrolyte (Li6.5La3Ta0.5Zr1.5O12) and current collector (Ni) as a function of applied stress (1–10 MPa) and Li foil thickness (100–700 μm). At 1 MPa applied stress, the strain rate of all Li foil thicknesses under compression was almost four orders of magnitude lower than what is predicted from tensile creep tests. Steady-state creep behavior was observed for Li foil ≥350 μm at 5 MPa and ≥250 μm at 10 MPa. Conversely, sustained creep deformation was not observed for 100 and 150 μm Li foils at any applied stress. It is suggested that friction at the Li/LLZO and Li/Ni interfaces leads to the formation of hydrostatic stress that controls Li deformation at low aspect ratios. These results have implications for battery pack stack pressure requirements, particularly relating to void formation during stripping and Li metal filament penetration during plating.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230831
Ionic Liquid and Polymer Coated Garnet Solid Electrolytes for High-Energy Solid-State Lithium Metal Batteries,"© 2021 The Authors. Energy Technology published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Garnet solid-state electrolytes are promising for lithium metal batteries in terms of safety and stability. However, their rigid and brittle nature under humid air increase the interfacial resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Herein, the ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide ([Py1,4]TFSI) is employed to dissolve poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) polymer microstructures that facilitate ion transport through an amorphous rather than a crystalline polymer matrix. The PEO-IL coatings on Ga doped garnet (LLZO) solid-state electrolyte can effectively suppress the formation of Li2CO3 passivation layers on the garnet surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results show that the interfacial resistance of PEO-IL coated Ga-LLZO is much lower than that of uncoated Ga-LLZO. In addition, the surface of PEO-IL@Ga-LLZO is flatter and it has a better contact with the Li anode than uncoated Ga-LLZO. A symmetric cell of Li/PEO-IL coated solid electrolyte/Li exhibits flat voltage profiles with overpotentials of less than 15 mV and shows a stable lithium plating/stripping process. A solid-state battery based on PEO-IL@Ga-LLZO solid electrolyte combined with lithium metal anode and LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode delivers a specific capacity of ≈120 mAh g−1 with a Coulombic efficiency greater than 96% at 10 mA g(LFP)−1.",Energy Technology,10.1002/ente.202100907
Insight into the solid-liquid electrolyte interphase between Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 and LiPF6-based liquid electrolyte,"© 2021Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte (SE) has been widely used as a promising material providing protection for Li anode in lithium-ion and hybrid-electrolyte cells due to its high ionic conductivity and superior stability against Li metal. So far much efforts have been expended on addressing the issues at LLZO/Li metal interface, but relatively little attention was placed on the interface between LLZO and liquid electrolyte (LE), while this interface is also crucial for the successful implementation of protected Li metal batteries. Herein, we devote an effort to clarifying the characteristics of the SLEI between Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) and LiPF6-based LE. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism and improved approaches are particularly emphasized and discussed. The presence of trace water in LE plays an important role in the formation of SLEI, as it can accelerate the H+/Li+ exchange of LLZTO and self-decomposition of LiPF6. LiF generated from LiPF6 decomposition and HF corrosion is confirmed as the main component of SLEI via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling. The thickness of the SLEI increase with time, the maximum thickness is about 40 nm after immersion in LE for 48 h. We expect that this systematic methodology can serve as a reference for investigating various SLEI for broader applications.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151638
Improving ionic conductivity of doped Li7La3Zr2O12 using optimized machine learning with simplistic descriptors,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The dawn of machine learning methods brings a possible solution to efficiently get through the vast design space of doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid-state electrolytes. In this work, a machine learning model to classify the ionic conductivity of doped LLZO is developed using features derived from molecular, structural, and electronic descriptors. Meticulous model selection, validation, and optimization yielded a classifier based on the Light Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm with a leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy score of 0.903. Two key aspects were identified to obtain doped LLZO with high ionic conductivity, namely electrolyte's relative density and Li site dopant's electronegativity. This study illustrates the role of powerful data-driven methods with easily obtainable features in accelerating the process of novel solid-state electrolyte design.",Materials Letters,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.131159
Sheet-like garnet structure design for upgrading PEO-based electrolyte,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Polyoxyethylene (PEO)-based electrolyte is one of the most promising solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates for all-solid-state batteries due to its high flexible and salt solubility. Recently, morphological control on active fillers is confirmed as a critical issue affecting the performance of SSE. However, the lack of comprehensive research is hindering the understanding over the growth mechanism of the structured active fillers. Especially, compared with other dimensions, the studies on the growth mechanism of two-dimensional (2D) active fillers are quite limited due to the difficulties in physical methods such as exfoliation. Herein, sheet-like LLZAO (Li6.25La3Zr2Al0.25O12) (SL) is synthesized by bottom-up method to upgrade PEO matrix (SL@PEO). In addition, the growth mechanism of SL is proposed, which provides a new sight for morphology control over inorganic solid electrolytes. The SL structure provides continuous interfaces between the fillers and the polymer matrix, which ensures rapid diffusion of lithium ions. In addition, the SL can provide more nature barriers for electrolyte to suppress the lithium dendrites growth. The lithium symmetric cells adopting SL@PEO present prolonged cycling stability and higher critical current density compared with the control samples. The assembled all-solid-state LiFePO4/SL@PEO/Li batteries exhibit superior cycling stability and rate capability.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.132343
Sr2+ and Mo6+ co-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 with superior ionic conductivity,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), a kind of solid-state electrolyte possessing the potential to realize an all-solid-state battery, attracts lots of attention. The Sr2+ and Mo6+ are co-doped into LLZO to obtain Li6.6+xLa3−xSrxZr1.8Mo0.2O12, in which x varies from 0 to 0.2. The strategy of doping Mo6+ into Zr4+-site can effectively ensure the formation of the cubic phase. On the basis of Zr4+-site doping method, doping appropriate Sr2+ can further improve the ionic conductivity and the relative density of the sample. A low temperature of 1100 °C and the cold pressing sintering method are applied. Through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrum, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), we further discuss the mechanism of doping elements into lattice of LLZO. When x = 0.05, the sample Li6.65La2.95Sr0.05Zr1.8Mo0.2O12 exhibits the ionic conductivity of 6.43 × 10−4 S cm−1 (the highest among the works which used single Sr2+ or Mo6+ to dope LLZO) and the relative density of 95%.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.161906
Single-ion polymer/LLZO hybrid electrolytes with high lithium conductivity,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Hybrid solid electrolytes which combine the properties of inorganic and polymeric ion conductors are being investigated for lithium batteries which use lithium metal anodes. The number of inorganic/polymer compositions and their synergy in ion-conducting properties are limited by the hybrid fabrication method and the limited compatibility between both types of materials. Here we report a hybrid solid electrolyte formed by a poly(ethylene glycol) type single-ion polymer network and ceramic garnet-type nanoparticles of Li7-3XAlXLa3Zr2O12 (LLZO) with very high lithium conductivity. The combination of a lithium-single ion polymer matrix with LLZO inorganic particles results in flexible free-standing films by using a fast UV-photopolymerization process with facile control of its composition. This methodology showed excellent dispersion of the LLZO nanoparticles within the gel polymer network with up to 50 wt% ceramic content, as shown in the enviromental ESEM images. These hybrid electrolytes have high ionic conductivity values (1.4 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 25 °C) and high lithium transference number as compared to previous hybrid electrolytes. The effect of LLZO nanoparticle content on the lithium transport was investigated in detail using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Finally, determination of the critical current density (CCD) before lithium dendrites are initiated has been carried out on both pristine and hybrid electrolytes, so as to assess their potential as solid electrolytes for lithium metal batteries.",Materials Advances,10.1039/d1ma00857a
Modeling study of stress generation of a single active material particle connected to solid electrolyte in solid-state batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdOne of the major problems with solid-state batteries (SSBs) is the mechanical degradation of the interfacial structures between active materials (AMs) and solid electrolytes (SEs). In this study, we established a single particle model to study stress generation of AM particles surrounded by SEs and their impact on the mechanical degradation of SSBs including Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) or Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS). When the AM particle was constrained by the SE, the first principal stress of the AM particle was significantly higher than that of the AM particle in the liquid electrolyte. The changes in the direction and magnitude of the stress strongly depended on the locations of the AM/SE. The largest change in the stress was often observed in the interface of the SE and the trend is dependent on the Young's modulus ratio of AM to SE. Because the interface between the AM and SE experiences the most significant mechanical degradation, it is crucial to find the optimal combination of AMs and SEs based on the mechanical properties for the design of SSBs to reduce the probability of failure. Moreover, we investigated the effect of the material properties, porosity, and contact area between AMs and SEs on the lithium transport and stress evolution. To minimize the mechanical degradation of SSBs, it is necessary to increase the AM/SE contact ratio and to achieve homogeneous AM particle distribution that enables a higher local volume fraction of SE. The results of this study can provide valuable insights into the fracture behavior of SSBs and guide the electrode design to minimize the mechanical degradation.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139639
Efficient Anion Fluoride-Doping Strategy to Enhance the Performance in Garnet-Type Solid Electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Garnet-type solid-state electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is expected to realize the next generation of high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries. However, the severe dendrite penetration at the pores and grain boundaries inside the solid electrolyte hinders the practical application of LLZO. Here, it is reported that the desirable quality and dense garnet Li6.8Al0.2La3Zr2O11.80F0.20 can be obtained by fluoride anion doping, which can effectively facilitate grain nucleation and refine the grain; thereby, the ionic conductivity increased to 7.45 × 10-4 at 30 °C and the relative density reached to 95.4%. At the same time, we introduced a transition layer to build the Li6.8Al0.2La3Zr2O11.80F0.20-t electrolyte in order to supply a stable contact; as a result, the interface resistance of Li|Li6.8Al0.2La3Zr2O11.80F0.20-t decreases to 12.8 ω cm2. The Li|Li6.8Al0.2La3Zr2O11.80F0.20-t|Li symmetric cell achieved a critical current density of 1.0 mA cm-2 at 25 °C, which could run stably for 1000 h without a short circuit at 0.3 mA cm-2 and 25 °C. Moreover, the Li|LiFePO4 battery exhibited a high Coulombic efficiency (>99.5%), an excellent rate capability, and a great capacity retention (123.7 mA h g-1, ≈80%) over 500 cycles at 0.3C and 25 °C. The Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell operated well at 0.2C and 25 °C and delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 151.4 mA h g-1 with a good capacity retention (70%) after 195 cycles. This work demonstrates that the anion doping in LLZO is an effective method to prepare a dense garnet ceramic for the high-performance lithium batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c21951
Rational Design of LLZO/Polymer Solid Electrolytes for Solid-State Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Hybrid composite electrolytes incorporate polymer matrixes and garnet filler attract the focus of concern for all-solid-state batteries, which possess high ionic conductivity, superior electrochemical stability, and wide electrochemical window of ceramic electrolyte advantages, and exhibit excellent flexibility and tensile shear strength from polymer electrolyte benefits. Hence, the unique structure design of solid-state electrolytes resolves the existing defects that the use of either single garnet or polymer electrolytes implemented into battery devices. This review summarizes Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)/polymer solid composite electrolytes (SCEs), comprising LLZO/polymer SCEs with various structures and different ratios of LLZO fillers, LLZO/polymer with different kinds of polymers matrix and hybrid lithium-salt, and Li+ transport pathways within the LLZO/polymers SCEs interface.

Stabilizing High-Voltage Cathodes via Ball-Mill Coating with Flame-Made Nanopowder Electrolytes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (LMNO) spinel has recently been the subject of intense research as a cathode material because it is cheap, cobalt-free, and has a high discharge voltage (4.7 V). However, the decomposition of conventional liquid electrolytes on the cathode surface at this high oxidation state and the dissolution of Mn2+ have hindered its practical utility. We report here that simply ball-mill coating LMNO using flame-made nanopowder (NPs, 5-20 wt %, e.g., LiAlO2, LATSP, LLZO) electrolytes generates coated composites that mitigate these well-recognized issues. As-synthesized composite cathodes maintain a single P4332 cubic spinel phase. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) show island-type NP coatings on LMNO surfaces. Different NPs show various effects on LMNO composite cathode performance compared to pristine LMNO (120 mAh g-1, 93% capacity retention after 50 cycles at C/3, ∼67 mAh g-1 at 8C, and ∼540 Wh kg-1 energy density). For example, the LMNO + 20 wt % LiAlO2 composite cathodes exhibit Li+ diffusivities improved by two orders of magnitude over pristine LMNO and discharge capacities up to ∼136 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at C/3 (98% retention), while 10 wt % LiAlO2 shows ∼110 mAh g-1 at 10C and an average discharge energy density of ∼640 Wh kg-1. Detailed postmortem analyses on cycled composite electrodes demonstrate that NP coatings form protective layers. In addition, preliminary studies suggest potential utility in all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs).",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c09284
Analyzing void formation and rewetting of thin in situ-formed Li anodes on LLZO,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The transition from laboratory-scale thick Li-metal anodes (>500 μm) to thin (∼10–30 μm) Li anodes is necessary for the successful implementation of Li-metal solid-state batteries (LMSSBs). However, the mechanical deformation of Li along an interface depends on its thickness, making it essential to understand the interface mechanics between thin Li layers and solid electrolytes. We investigate the stripping behavior of thin Li electrodes that are formed using in situ plated (anode-free) Li on Li7La3Zr2O12 garnet-type solid electrolytes. We demonstrate that the accessible discharge capacity increases as current density decreases and the Li anode thickness increases. It is shown that two different mechanisms restrict the stripping of thin Li electrodes, depending on the current density. We demonstrate that de-wetted Li/LLZO interfaces during stripping can be reestablished using a thermal treatment. This approach could be integrated into future charging protocols, and the findings provide insight into LMSSB design, implementation, and operation.",Joule,10.1016/j.joule.2022.09.009
Production of Ta-Doped Li7La3Zr2O12Solid Electrolyte with High Critical Current Density,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Solid-state electrolytes are key materials for developing high-safety solid-state Li-ion batteries. The garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte is one of the most promising solid electrolytes due to its high conductivity and feasible preparation in ambient air. Among several dopants, Ta-doped LLZO (Ta-LLZO) delivers high stability against lithium metal and high conductivity, which attracts lots of researchers. However, production of Ta-LLZO ceramics is less problematic due to the complicated gas-liquid-solid sintering mechanism. This work aims to develop an efficient method to produce Ta-LLZO solid electrolyte ceramic pellets, including providing a stacking sintering method and optimizing the amount of excessive Li source, the wet milling duration, and the sintering temperature. First, a low-cost, efficient ""gravel-separator""strategy is provided for multiple sintering of LLZO. Second, the Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (Ta5) samples with different excessive Li levels (2, 4, 6, and 8%) are sintered at various sintering conditions of 1240 °C for 60 min, 1280 °C for 20 min, and 1320 °C for 2 min to search for the optimum excessive amount of Li. Third, Ta5 samples with optimized excessive Li (4, 6%) after milling for longer duration are sintered at 1280 °C for 30 min, 1300 °C for 10 min, 1320 °C for 10 min, 1320 °C for 30 min to finally optimize the preparation craft. After optimization, the Ta5 ceramics with excessive 4 and 6% Li sintered at 1320 °C for 10 min deliver homogeneous and dense cross-sectional morphology, high conductivity of over 1 × 10-3 S cm-1 at room temperature, and relative densities of above 96%. Furthermore, symmetric Li cells assembled with the Ta-LLZO solid electrolyte prepared with the optimized method deliver a critical current density of 1.28 mA cm-2 at 30 °C and over 1000 h of stable cycling at 0.2 mA cm-2 (0.2 mA h cm-2) at 30 °C.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.2c02441
The effects of aluminum concentration on the microstructural and electrochemical properties of lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Cubic lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (Li7−xAlxLa3Zr2O12, LLZO) garnet has gained attention as a promising next-generation electrolyte for lithium batteries due to its high ionic conductivity and chemical stability with lithium metal. The high conductivity can be achieved through doping over a range of aluminum concentrations. In this study, we hot-pressed samples to achieve <2% nominal porosity with aluminum concentrations from x = 0.25-0.55 mol to understand the effect of aluminum on microstructure and electrochemistry. It was observed that beyond the aluminum solubility limit (x = ∼0.40), resistive secondary phases formed at the grain boundaries. As a result, the percent grain boundary resistance increased from 17.6 to 41.2% for x = 0.25 and x = 0.55, respectively. Both the grain boundary and bulk activation energies remained relatively constant as the aluminum concentrations increased (∼0.44 eV and ∼0.39 eV, respectively). It was, therefore, surmised that the mobility term of the Nernst-Einstein equation was roughly independent of aluminum concentration and the major variable controlling bulk conductivity was the number of lithium charge carriers. As a result, as the aluminum concentration increased from x = 0.25 to x = 0.55 the bulk conductivity decreased from 0.56 to 0.15 mS cm−1. Following these trends of increasing grain boundary resistance and decreasing bulk conductivity with increasing aluminum concentration, x = 0.25 had the highest total conductivity (0.46 mS cm−1). We demonstrated that aluminum concentration has a significant effect on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of LLZO. We believe this work could help understand how to link processing, microstructure, and electrochemical properties to guide the manufacturing of LLZO for use in solid-state batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta03676b
Three-dimensional hierarchical composite polymer electrolyte with enhanced interfacial compatibility for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries,"© 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) are regarded as promising candidates for high-energy-density all-solid-state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) because they combine the merits of solid polymer electrolytes and inorganic solid electrolytes. However, poor electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility and filler agglomeration limit their practical application. In this study, an in-situ polymerization method was used to create a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical CPE using 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (KH570)-modified Li6.4La3Zr2Al0.2O12 (KH@LLZO) particles. The KH@LLZO-rich (up to 80 wt%) region of the electrolyte provides a rigid barrier to prevent lithium dendrite growth, while the other region of the electrolyte with an appropriate KH@LLZO content (8 wt%) achieving optimal ionic conductivity infiltrates into the entire battery system to allow for smooth Li+ transport. The symmetric Li|Li cell exhibits steady lithium plating/stripping cycling over 600 h at 0.3 mA h cm−2 and has a decent critical current density of 0.9 mA cm−2. This is made possible by the elaborate structure of the electrolytes. Full Li|LiFePO4 cells have preferable cycling stability (capacity retention of 91.6% after 200 cycles at 0.5 C). Moreover, pouch cells that use the in-situ-formed electrolyte exhibit excellent flexibility and safety. This novel design of 3D hierarchical CPEs using surface-modified LLZO particles paves the way for the development of dendrite-free and high-performance ASSLMBs.

Effect of Li2O excess in Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12 electrolyte for all-solid-state Li-ion batteries,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.Li7La3Zr2O12 is a promising material used as solid electrolyte in all-solid-state lithium batteries. However, the lithium ionic conductivity of LLZO is limited, and the cycling stability of lithium symmetric battery based on LLZO is not good. In this research, different Ga-doped LLZO samples were prepared by adding different excess amounts of Li2O, and the effect of excess amount of Li2O on the structure and performance of LLZO have been researched. The results show that with the rise of the amount of Li2O, the lithium ionic concentration increases gradually, and the lithium ionic conductivity and the ratio of grain resistance to total resistance rise first and then drop. When the excess amount of Li2O is 10 wt.%, the sample exhibits the highest lithium ionic conductivity of 1.36 mS/cm, and the lithium symmetric battery exhibits the most stable operation.",International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology,10.1111/ijac.14218
Understanding the electro-chemo-mechanics of Li plating in anode-free solid-state batteries with operando 3D microscopy,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Anode-free solid-state batteries can enable high energy densities and the ability to manufacture high-quality interfaces. However, during in situ anode formation, dynamic mechanical stresses influence the initial Li metal plating morphology. This work utilizes operando 3D video microscopy to characterize electrode morphology during in situ anode formation on garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolytes. The coupled morphological evolution and electrochemical signatures are identified and are attributed to changes in stress at the interface. We demonstrate the influence of stress on both thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors at the interface. A mechanistic framework provides insight into the importance of tuning the interfacial toughness, current collector properties, stack pressure, and cell geometry to optimize performance and control plating uniformity. Informed by these insights, the areal Li coverage after 2 mAh/cm2 of plating is increased from 50% to 95%. The understanding from this study informs future optimization of in situ anode formation in solid-state systems.",Matter,10.1016/j.matt.2022.07.020

Meanwhile, the applied pressures were 20, 30, and 40 MPa. XRD analysis equipped with the Le Bail Refinement found that the Al-Y-doped LLZO was crystallized within cubic phase, with a percentage composition of 84.89%. Impedance analysis followed by ZView fitting and conductivity calculation found that the green pellet formed by 40 MPa CIP pressure provide the highest ionic conductivity, i.e., 1.06 × 10–5 S cm−1.

Developing Preparation Craft Platform for Solid Electrolytes Containing Volatile Components: Experimental Study of Competition between Lithium Loss and Densification in Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is one of the most promising candidate solid electrolytes for high-safety solid-state batteries. However, similar to other solid electrolytes containing volatile components during high-temperature sintering, the preparation of densified LLZO with high conductivity is challenging involving the complicated gas-liquid-solid sintering mechanism. Further attention on establishing low-cost laborastory-scale preparation craft platform of LLZO ceramic is also required. This work demonstrates a ""pellet on gravel""sintering strategy, which is performed in a MgO crucible and box furnace under ambient air without any special equipment or expensive consumables. In addition, the competition between lithium loss from the sintering system and internal grain densification is critically studied, whereas the influences of particle surface energy, Li-loss amount, and initial excess Li2O amount are uncovered. Based on the sintering behavior and mechanism, optimized craft platform for preparing dense LLZO solid electrolytes including mixing, calcination, particle tailoring and sintering is provided. Finally, exemplary Ta-doped LLZO pellets with 2 wt% La2Zr2O7 additives sintered at 1260-1320 °C for 20 min deliver Li+ conductivities of ∼9 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 25 °C, relative densities of >96%, and a dense cross-sectional microstructure. As a practical demonstration, LLZO solid electrolyte with optimized performance is applied in both Li-Li symmetric cells and Li-S batteries. This work sheds light on the practical production of high-quality LLZO ceramics and provides inspiration for sintering ceramics containing volatile compounds.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c08442

Laser sintering of ceramic-based solid-state battery materials,"Copyright © 2022 SPIE.Solid-state batteries (SSBs) are a promising technology for high travelling ranges and safety in future electromobility. In SSBs, separator and liquid electrolyte materials are combined in a solid-state electrolyte layer. Possible materials for SSBs are ceramic oxides, for example LiCoO2 (LCO) as cathode material and Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) as electrolyte material. By means of screen printing, a mixed cathode material (mixture of cathode and electrolyte material to have higher ionic conductivity in the cathode) is applied on a stainless steel current collector foil and after thermal processing, the electrolyte material is printed on top of the sintered mixed cathode to create a half-cell. Both layers are thermally post treated (dried and sintered) in consecutive steps to produce functional layers for SSBs. Conventional heat treatment is done in an oven process. A main disadvantage is the diffusion of materials into adjacent layers due to long process times (range of minutes) at high temperatures. Furthermore, the battery half-cell cannot be treated at high temperatures due to incompatibilities in decomposition temperatures of LLZO and LCO. Preservation of the crystal structure and a suitable temperature management during the sintering process are of enormous importance. By means of laser processing, short interaction times (range of seconds and below) are realized. High heating rates show potential for reducing diffusion processes and preserving the crystal structure of the materials. In this work, the influence of different interaction times on crystal structure and adhesion are investigated for laser sintering of LLZO and LCO micro particle layers.",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1117/12.2607752
"Synthesis, Structure, Transport Properties, Electrochemical Stability Window, and Lithium Plating/Stripping of Mg and Nb Codoped Li7La3Zr2O12Garnet-Type Solid Electrolytes","© 2022 American Chemical Society.In this work, the Mg and Nb codoped garnet-type solid electrolytes Li7+x-yLa3-xMgxZr2-yNbyO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4; 0.4 ≤ y ≤ 0.8) for all-solid-state Li-ion batteries were prepared by conventional solid-state method. The formation of a single-phase garnet structure (space group Ia3¯ d) with lattice constant decreased from 12.94452(19) Å (x = 0, y = 0.4) to 12.92286(14) Å (x = 0.4, y = 0.8) have been observed. The La and Zr were substituted by Mg (24c) and Nb (16a), respectively, which greatly altered the conductivity of the sample. Additionally, a high-density structure was obtained through sintering at 1150 °C. The Mg and Nb codoped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) achieved Li-ion conductivity, ranging from 7.49 × 10-4 S·cm-1 (x = 0, y = 0.4) to 1.95 × 10-4 S·cm-1 (x = 0.4, y = 0.8) at 25 °C. The Li-ion 3D diffusion pathway was constructed by the bond valence sum mapping of Mg and Nb codoped LLZO. The Mg and Nb codoped LLZO retains remarkable electrochemical stability against lithium after 600 cycles at 0.1 mA·cm-2. This work may inspire the rational design of garnet-based electrolyte materials to attain high performance in the energy storage field.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c01380
Instability of Ga-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 toward metallic Li,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryGa-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet is among the most promising solid electrolytes for next-generation all-solid-state Li battery (SSLB) applications due to its very high Li-ion conductivity. However, the attempts to use Ga-substituted LLZO as a solid electrolyte for SSLBs are not yet successful. Here, the research results show that Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12 can be reduced by Li at 25 °C when the surface of the material is properly cleaned. The experimental results suggest that Ga leached out of the garnet structure to form the Li-Ga alloy, which apparently would short-circuit the battery if Ga-substituted LLZO is used as a solid electrolyte. When low concentration Ga-substitution is applied, e.g. Li6.45Ga0.05La3Zr1.6Ta0.4O12, the material seems stable against Li at ambient temperature but not at high temperatures, where heat treatment is usually used to reduce the interfacial resistance between Li and LLZO. The experimental results are also supported by density functional theory calculations to show that the Ga-substituted LLZO/Li interface tends to transform into LLZO and the Li2Ga intermetallic compound. The results highlight the importance of substitution selection for LLZO, for which the Ga-substituted LLZO solid electrolyte may not be suitable for direct contact with metallic Li.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta10215j
Atomistic insight into the dopant impacts at the garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte grain boundaries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) as one of the most promising solid electrolytes (SEs) has attracted great research attention owing to its high compatibility with Li metal anodes. Doping with a supervalent cation is an effective strategy to stabilize cubic LLZO with desired high ion conductivity. The behaviour of dopants at the grain boundary (GB) (e.g. segregation) is expected to have a great influence on the properties of LLZO but is far from understood. Here we have performed first-principles calculations to reveal the atomic-scale impact of dopants at the GB of the LLZO SE. The results show that Al and Ga dopants at the GB are preferentially segregated at the 24d site of Li with three neighbouring Li-ions, and Nb and Ta dopants prefer to locate at the 5-coordinated and partially distorted 6-coordinated Zr sites at the GB. The segregation of a Nb-like dopant at the GB will improve Li-ion conductivity, while the GB with an Al-like dopant shows conductivity comparable to that of the undoped one and fragmentation of the Li-ion diffusion network. Moreover, the electronic state calculations indicate electron accumulation at the doped GBs, in contrast to the mitigation effect of the dopants on dendrite formation along LLZO GBs revealed by the calculation of Li interstitial formation energy. We also explored the potentially existing phases at the doped coarse GBs, and a series of products have been proposed. These comprehensive calculations provide valuable atomistic insights into the dopants at the GB in the LLZO SE and substantial knowledge of optimization of this material.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d2ta00545j

Deep hydration of an Li7-3xLa3Zr2M IIIxO12solid-state electrolyte material: A case study on Al- and Ga-stabilized LLZO,"© 2022 EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.Single crystals of an Li-stuffed, Al- and Ga-stabilized garnet-type solid-state electrolyte material, Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO), have been analysed using single-crystal X-ray diffraction to determine the pristine structural state immediately after synthesis via ceramic sintering techniques. Hydrothermal treatment at 150°C for 28 d induces a phase transition in the Al-stabilized compound from the commonly observed cubic Ia d structure to the acentric I 3d subtype. LiIions at the interstitial octahedrally (4+2-fold) coordinated 48e site are most easily extracted and AlIIIions order onto the tetrahedral 12a site. Deep hydration induces a distinct depletion of LiIat this site, while the second tetrahedral site, 12b, suffers only minor LiIloss. Charge balance is maintained by the incorporation of HI, which is bonded to an O atom. Hydration of Ga-stabilized LLZO induces similar effects, with complete depletion of LiIat the 48e site. The LiI/HIexchange not only leads to a distinct increase in the unit-cell size, but also alters some bonding topology, which is discussed here.",Acta Crystallographica Section C: Structural Chemistry,10.1107/S2053229621012250

Mesoscale Interrogation Reveals Mechanistic Origins of Lithium Filaments along Grain Boundaries in Inorganic Solid Electrolytes,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSolid-state batteries (SSBs), utilizing a lithium metal anode, promise to deliver enhanced energy and power densities compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries. Penetration of lithium filaments through the solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) during electrodeposition poses major constraints on the safety and rate performance of SSBs. While microstructural attributes, especially grain boundaries (GBs) within the SSEs are considered preferential metal propagation pathways, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood yet. Here, a comprehensive insight is presented into the mechanistic interactions at the mesoscale including the electrochemical-mechanical response of the GB-electrode junction and competing ion transport dynamics in the SSE. Depending on the GB transport characteristics, a highly non-uniform electrodeposition morphology consisting of either cavities or protrusions at the GB-electrode interface is identified. Mechanical stability analysis reveals localized strain ramps in the GB regions that can lead to brittle fracture of the SSE. For ionically less conductive GBs compared to the grains, a crack formation and void filling mechanism, triggered by the heterogeneous nature of electrochemical-mechanical interactions is delineated at the GB-electrode junction. Concurrently, in situ X-ray tomography of pristine and failed Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) SSE samples confirm the presence of filamentous lithium penetration and validity of the proposed mesoscale failure mechanisms.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202102825

Revealing Atomic-Scale Ionic Stability and Transport around Grain Boundaries of Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 Solid Electrolyte,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Energy Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbHFor real applications of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) to be realized, understanding and control of the grain boundaries (GBs) are essential. However, the in-depth insight into the atomic-scale defect stabilities and transport of ions around GBs is still far from understood. Here, a first-principles investigation on the promising garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte (SE) GBs is carried out. The study reveals a GB-dependent behavior for the Li-ion transport correlated to the diffusion network. Of particular note, the Σ3(112) tilt GB model exhibits a quite high Li-ion conductivity comparable to that in bulk, and a fast intergranular diffusion, contrary to former discovered. Moreover, the uncovered preferential electron localization at the Σ3(112) GB leads to an increase in the electronic conductivity at the GB, and the Li accumulation at the coarse GBs is revealed from the negative Li interstitial formation energies. These factors play important roles in the dendrite formation along the GBs during Li plating in the LLZO|Li cell. These findings suggest strategies for the optimization of synthesis conditions and coating materials at the interface for preventing dendrite formation. The present comprehensive simulations provide new insights into the GB effect and engineering of the SE in ASSBs.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202102151
High lithium-ion conductivity in all-solid-state lithium batteries by Sb doping LLZO,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.All-solid-state lithium batteries are considered to be the most promising electrochemical energy storage equipment due to their high safety, high energy density, and simple structure. However, the preparation of solid electrolytes with high lithium-ion conductivity and superior electrode–electrolyte interface contact is the development needs. In this study, the electronic structures of garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and Sb-doped LLZO electrolytes were investigated using the first-principles method based on density functional theory (DFT). Theoretical calculations have confirmed that elemental doping facilitates the migration of lithium ions in solid-state electrolytes at the micro-atomic level. Based on the theoretical calculations and analysis results, Li6.7La3Zr1.7Sb0.3O12 (LLZSbO) with high ionic conductivity was synthesized by the conventional solid-state method. To reduce the interfacial impedance between electrolyte and electrode, the composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) containing LLZSbO active fillers were prepared by the solution casting method. The prepared CSEs exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 0.97 × 10–4 S cm−1 at 30 °C and a stable electrochemical window of 5.3 V as well as the lithium-ion transference number up to 0.37. The all-solid-state battery using the CSEs prepared with 20 wt% LLZSbO has excellent rate performance and cycle stability. The initial discharge specific capacity can reach 148.4 mAh g−1 when the rate is 0.1 C.

Improved Performance of All-Solid-State Lithium Metal Batteries via Physical and Chemical Interfacial Control,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) show several limitations, such as high flammability and Li dendrite growth. All-solid-state LMBs (ASSLMBs) are promising alternatives to conventional liquid electrolyte (LE)-based LMBs. However, it is challenging to prepare a solid electrolyte with both high ionic conductivity and low electrode–electrolyte interfacial resistance. In this study, to overcome these problems, a solid composite electrolyte (SCE) consisting of Li6.25La3Zr2Al0.25O12 and polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene is used, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years as a solid-state electrolyte. To operate LMBs without an LE, optimization of the electrode–solid-electrolyte interface is crucial. To achieve this, physical and chemical treatments are performed, i.e., direct growth of each layer by drop casting and thermal evaporation, and plasma treatment before the Li evaporation process, respectively. The optimized ASSLMB (amorphous V2O5−x (1 µm)/SCE (30 µm)/Li film (10 µm)) has a high discharge capacity of 136.13 mAh g−1 (at 50 °C and 5 C), which is 90% of that of an LMB with an LE. It also shows good cycling performance (>99%) over 1000 cycles. Thus, the proposed design minimizes the electrode–solid-electrolyte interfacial resistance, and is expected to be suitable for integration with existing commercial processes.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.202103433
The influence of hafnium impurities on the electrochemical performance of tantalum substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolytes,"© 2021, The Author(s).Garnet-based Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is considered one of the most promising oxide-ceramic solid electrolyte materials for inorganic all-solid-state batteries. Dopants and substituents like Al, Ta, Nb, Ga, and W were shown to have a high impact on the total ionic conductivity, increasing it from 10−6 S/cm up to 10−3 S/cm. However, natural zirconium sources always contain a small amount of hafnium which could also act as dopant, but the separation of these two elements is complicated and expensive. In this work, we investigate the influence of various Hf-impurity concentrations on the performance of tantalum-doped LLZO. We synthesised Li6.45Al0.05La3Zr1.6−xHfxTa0.4O12 (LLZHO with x = 0 – 1.6) via conventional solid-state synthesis and have demonstrated that up to x = 0.1, hafnium impurities do not have a significant impact on the performance of the material. Above this concentration, the Li-ion conductivity is steadily reduced to around 70% when zirconium is fully substituted by hafnium resulting in Li6.45Al0.05La3Hf1.6Ta0.4O12. As the purity of Zr precursors has a great impact on their price, these findings can help to reduce the price of LLZO in general, as lower grade zirconium can be used in industrial scale applications.",Ionics,10.1007/s11581-021-04300-w

However, the abnormal grain growth (AGG) phenomena easily occurring during sintering process could damage the mechanical strength of the electrolyte. In this paper, a series of Ga–Ba co-doping LLZO samples, Li7-3x + yGaxLa3-yBayZr2O12 (x = 0.25 and y = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, LGBLZO), were synthesized through sol-gel method to investigate the effects of Ba content on phase, morphology and ionic conduction in ceramics. The results demonstrated the influence mechanism of Ba ions in LGBLZO ceramics as follows. Firstly, the Ba ions as substitution of La sites could regulate the concentration of Li ions in lattice, reducing the bulk resistance. Secondly, the BaZrO3 embedded between grains could prevent abnormal growth of grains effectively. These ceramics acquired optimal relative density after sintering at 1160 °C for 15 h. When the Ba ions feed ratio reaches 0.25 pfu, the LGBLZO (y = 0.25) exhibits excellent performance with a relative density of 94.8%, an ionic conductivity of 8.30 × 10−4S/cm and an activation energy of 0.228eV.

The Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 powders were synthesized by using the molten salt method to reduce calcination temperature. And cold sintering was served to densify the powders and obtain the solid-state electrolyte, which could remedy the shortcoming of the conventional sintering. The influence of cold sintering temperature and holding time on the microstructures and electrochemical properties of Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 electrolyte were explored.

Thin laminar inorganic solid electrolyte with high ionic conductance towards high-performance all-solid-state lithium battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The development of thin solid-state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and mechanical strength is essential for high-performance all-solid-state lithium batteries. Although Inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) possess high ionic conductivity, fabricating thin and mechanically stable ISEs is still challenging. Herein, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) nanosheets with lateral size of 3–5 μm and thickness of ~4.5 nm were prepared, and then self-assembled into thin, defect-free, and freestanding LLZO laminar ISE (LLISE). Compared to LLZO pellet (>200 μm) obtained by cold-pressing method, LLISE with a thickness of 12 μm attains an almost 10-times higher ionic conductivity of 1.30 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C because of the short Li-ion diffusion distance. Importantly, this thin thickness gives high ionic conductance (0.17 S at 30 °C) and energy density of 340 Wh kg−1, ranking one of the highest values among reported solid-state electrolytes. Meanwhile, the compressive strength of LLISE with a thickness of 20 μm (LLISE-20) reaches 3.2 Gpa. The Li symmetrical cell assembled with LLISE-20 can work over 1500 h without obvious polarization under a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 at 60 °C. The LFP/Li cell exhibits superior cycling stability of 143.2 mAh g−1 at 0.5C and 60 °C after 200 cycles with low capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.131948
Preparing Li-garnet electrodes with engineered structures by phase inversion and high shear compaction processes,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietySolid-state lithium batteries are promising for safety and energy density compared with traditional lithium-ion batteries. However, the large interfacial resistance between the electrode and electrolyte is a bottleneck to achieving high-performance solid-state batteries. Engineered electrode structures with a porous scaffold of the solid electrolyte material are promising to lower the interfacial resistance and provide a mechanical support for a thin solid electrolyte layer. In this work, two ceramic processing techniques are used to fabricate porous/dense bilayer architectures based on a Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) Li-garnet material. Finger-like vertically aligned pores are created by the phase inversion (PI) process. A water bath presaturated with Li salt prevents Li loss during the PI solvent exchange step. Pore size and porosity can be optimized by adjusting the bath temperature. The high shear compaction process was used to prepare LLZO tapes with 40, 60, and 80 vol% poreformer. The porosity of the tapes after sintering is 39.5%, 58.4%, and 75.4%, respectively. Microtomography exhibits the porosity, pore shape, and pore distribution of the tapes. A typical cathode material LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 (NMC) is filled into the pores via vacuum infiltration, and a dense cathode layer is formed within the garnet scaffold.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/jace.18037
Freestanding Trilayer Hybrid Solid Electrolyte with Electrospun Interconnected Al-LLZO Nanofibers for Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Energy storage devices that are safe to use and thermally stable and have a wide working electrochemical window and high specific capacity would be a boon to modern society. All-solid-state lithium-metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are promising devices for energy storage because they fulfill these requirements. In this study, we used a solution-casting method to synthesize a freestanding trilayer hybrid solid-state electrolyte (Tri-HSE) membrane from a suspension of interconnected Li6.28La3Zr2Al0.24O12 (Al-LLZO, as the filler), poly(vinylidene fluoride)/poly(ethylene carbonate) (PVDF/PEC, as the blended polymer), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, as the salt), and succinonitrile (SN, as the plasticizer). The as-prepared Tri-HSE membrane exhibited a high ionic conductivity (ca. 3.91 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 25 °C), a high Li transference number (ca. 0.78), and a high tensile strength (ca. 11.36 MPa). The symmetric cell (Li/Tri-HSE/Li) was stable during Li plating/stripping cycles for 470 h without any short-circuiting. The assembled NCM811/Tri-HSE/Li full cell operated between 2.6 and 4.2 V cut-off voltages, displaying a high initial discharge capacity (162.59 mAh g-1) and a high capacity retention (92.41%) after 100 cycles at a rate of 0.1C. Also, at a rate of 0.2C, it displayed admirable capacity retentions and average Coulombic efficiencies of 87.52, 83.40 and 99.21, 99.47%, after 450 and 250 cycles, at 4.2 and 4.3 V cut-off voltages, respectively. Moreover, the 5 × 3 cm2 dimensional pouch cell assembled using the same membrane reveals an average Coulombic efficiency and capacity retention of 99.53 and 95.58% after 30 cycles, respectively. Therefore, this as-synthesized Tri-HSE membrane-characterized by high flexibility, ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, wide electrochemical window, and low in situ heat generation-appears to be a promising solid-state electrolyte for upcoming generations of lithium-metal batteries operated at room temperature.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.1c03202
Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of Al- and Nb-Codoped LLZO Ceramic Powder and Its Composite Solid Electrolyte,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Using a solid-state method, a Li6.25Al0.2La3Zr1.85Nb0.15O12 (LALZNO) ceramic solid-state electrolyte (SSE) was prepared by codoping with Al and Nb. A PEO-LiTFSI-20%LALZNO composite solid electrolyte (CSE) was prepared by incorporating LALZNO into a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) polymer using a solution casting method. Characterization of these materials shows that the lattice distortion caused by the codoping of Al and Nb into Li and Zr sites increases Li+ vacancy concentration and modifies Li+ transmission channels. The ionic conductivity of the LALZNO ceramic SSE at room temperature (RT, 25 °C) can reach 3.04 × 10-4 S/cm. When the LALZNO concentration in the LALZNO/PEO composite is 20 wt %, the PEO-LiTFSI-20%LALZNO CSE exhibits a maximum ionic conductivity (7.64 × 10-5 S/cm at RT), a wide electrochemical window (5.5 V vs Li/ Li+), and a high lithium-ion transport number (0.28). Testing a Li||PEO-LiTFSI-20%LALZNO||Li symmetrical cell shows that this solid electrolyte can be stably cycled for 500 h at 60 °C with a fixed areal capacity of 0.2 mAh/cm2. Furthermore, performance tests of the all-solid-state battery LiFePO4||PEO-LiTFSI-20%LALZNO||Li show that the CSE has excellent cycling and rate performance. This all-solid-state battery can stably cycle for more than 100 cycles under conditions of 60 °C and 0.2C. Furthermore, it retains a specific discharge capacity of 91.6% after 100 cycles, and its Coulombic efficiency is close to 100%.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.1c02644

Therefore, a continuing evolution of battery performance can benefit a wide gamut of space science missions conducted or planned by NASA and worldwide space agencies. Venus presents the most significant challenge to energy storage systems due to a combination of high temperature (465 °C) and the presence of corrosive gases (CO2, CO, SO2, and N2).

The proof-of-concept Li∥Se cells were built using baseline cell electrodes, electrolytes, and cell design. The fabricated Li∥Se cell was tested in an in-house built cell holder placed in an argon-filled glovebox. Electrochemical testing includes time-dependent open-circuit voltage measurements across a wide temperature range (230–500 °C) and electrochemical cycling at multiple current rates at 465 °C.

Critical Current Density Limitation of LLZO Solid Electrolyte: Microstructure vs Interface,"© 2021 The Author(s). Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte is a promising candidate for all-solid-state lithium battery (ASSB) due to its high ionic conductivity and stability against lithium metal. Dense LLZO pellets were prepared by high-temperature sintering and a Li3BO3 melting agent was used to control the microstructure (grain size and grain boundary chemistry). An ionic conductivity of 0.49 mS•cm-1 was measured at room temperature. The LLZO/Li interface was modified by introducing an aluminum layer. The impact of the microstructure of LLZO ceramics and the chemistry of the LLZO/Li interface were discussed by measuring the critical current density (CCD). Even though secondary phases at the grain boundary lead to an increase of the electronic conductivity, no significant influence of the microstructure on the CCD value (50 μA•cm-2) has been established. The low CCD value has been improved by forming an Al-Li alloy interlayer at the LLZO/Li interface, due to a better homogenization of the Li current at the interface.

Microstructural impacts on ionic conductivity of oxide solid electrolytes from a combined atomistic-mesoscale approach,"© 2021, The Author(s).Although multiple oxide-based solid electrolyte materials with intrinsically high ionic conductivities have emerged, practical processing and synthesis routes introduce grain boundaries and other interfaces that can perturb primary conduction channels. To directly probe these effects, we demonstrate an efficient and general mesoscopic computational method capable of predicting effective ionic conductivity through a complex polycrystalline oxide-based solid electrolyte microstructure without relying on simplified equivalent circuit description. We parameterize the framework for Li7-xLa3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet solid electrolyte by combining synthetic microstructures from phase-field simulations with diffusivities from molecular dynamics simulations of ordered and disordered systems. Systematically designed simulations reveal an interdependence between atomistic and mesoscopic microstructural impacts on the effective ionic conductivity of polycrystalline LLZO, quantified by newly defined metrics that characterize the complex ionic transport mechanism. Our results provide fundamental understanding of the physical origins of the reported variability in ionic conductivities based on an extensive analysis of literature data, while simultaneously outlining practical design guidance for achieving desired ionic transport properties based on conditions for which sensitivity to microstructural features is highest. Additional implications of our results are discussed, including a possible connection between ion conduction behavior and dendrite formation.",npj Computational Materials,10.1038/s41524-021-00681-8
Influence of powder milling and annealing parameters on the formation of cubic li7 la3 zr2 o12 compound,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Li-ion batteries are widely used as energy storage devices due to their excellent electrochemical performance. The cubic Li7 La3 Zr2 O12 (c-LLZO) compound is regarded as a promising candidate as a solid-state electrolyte for lithium-ion batteries due to its high bulk Li-ion conductivity, excellent thermal performance, and chemical stability. The standard manufacturing procedure involves the high-temperature and lengthy annealing of powders. However, the formation of the tetragonal modification of LLZO and other undesired side phases results in the deterioration of electrochemical properties. The mechanical milling of precursor powders can enhance the powders’ reactivity and can result in an easier formation of c-LLZO. The aim of this work was to study the influence of selected milling and annealing parameters on c-LLZO compound formation. The starting powders of La(OH)3, Li2 CO3, and ZrO2 were subjected to milling in various ball mills, under different milling conditions. The powders were then annealed at various temperatures for different lengths of times. These studies showed that the phase transformation processes of the powders were not very sensitive to the milling parameters. On the other hand, the final phase composition and microstructure strongly depended on heat treatment conditions. Low temperature annealing (750◦ C) for 3 h produced 90% of c-LLZO in the powder structure.",Materials,10.3390/ma14247633
Efficient Mutual-Compensating Li-Loss Strategy toward Highly Conductive Garnet Ceramics for Li-Metal Solid-State Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a promising solid-state electrolyte (SSE) due to its high Li+ conductivity and stability against lithium metal. However, wide research and application of LLZO are hampered by the difficulty in sintering highly conductive LLZO ceramics, which is mainly attributed to its poor sinterability and the hardship of controlling the Li2O atmosphere at a high sintering temperature (∼1200 °C). Herein, an efficient mutual-compensating Li-loss (MCLL) method is proposed to effectively control the Li2O atmosphere during the sintering process for highly conductive LLZO ceramics. The Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) ceramic SSEs sintered by the MCLL method own high relative density (96%), high Li content (5.54%), high conductivity (7.19 × 10-4 S cm-1), and large critical current density (0.85 mA cm-2), equating those sintered by a hot-pressing technique. The assembled Li-Li symmetric battery and a Li-metal solid-state battery (LMSSB) show that the as-prepared LLZTO can achieve a small interfacial resistance (17 ω cm2) with Li metal, exhibits high electrochemical stability against Li metal, and has broad potential in the application of LMSSBs. In addition, this method can also improve the sintering efficiency, avoid the use of mother powder, and reduce raw-material cost, and thus it may promote the large-scale preparation and wide application of LLZO ceramic SSE.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c15115

In this work, Li6.25La3Zr2-yAlxTayO12 (x = 0.25, y = 0; x = 0.2, y = 0.15; x = 0.15, y = 0.3; x = 0.1, y = 0.45; x = 0.05, y = 0.6) and Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZT0.6O) ceramic electrolytes, are prepared via a simple sol–gel process. The effect of Al and Ta co-doping levels on the phase, the microstructure and the ionic conductivity of modified LLZO is discussed in detail. Those Al/Ta co-doped LLZO ceramics (LLZATO) with Ta ≥ 0.3 per formula unit, are nearly pure cubic structures with a trace of new phases. The ionic conductivities of Li6.25La3Zr1.55Al0.1Ta0.45O12 (LLZA0.1T0.45O) and Li6.25La3Zr1.4Al0.05Ta0.6O12 (LLZA0.05T0.6O), are greatly improved by co-doping Al and Ta, benefitting from the emergence of self-grown LiAlO2 phase, and the microstructure of large grains contacting small grains. Remarkably, the optimal LLZA0.1T0.45O delivers a high ionic conductivity of 6.70 × 10–4 S cm−1 and a low electronic conductivity ~ 9.83 × 10–8 S cm−1 at 25 °C.

Dual-interface reinforced flexible solid garnet batteries enabled by in-situ solidified gel polymer electrolytes,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is deemed as the promising solid electrolyte for solid lithium batteries due to its high stability and ionic conductivity. However, the rigid and brittle natures of LLZO lead to severe interfacial issues from both the cathode and the Li-metal anode sides, as well as limited applications in flexible electronics. In this work, the in-situ solidified gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are constructed as not only the interlayer to buffer electrode/garnet interfaces, but also the adhesive to join garnet blocks together, realizing the scale expansion and good flexibility of solid garnet batteries. For interface engineering, such GPE is conformally solidified at electrode/garnet interfaces, along with the cathode particles fully surrounded by solidified electrolytes. On anode sides, the Li/garnet interfacial resistance notably drops to 88 Ω cm2, accompanied by the symmetric cell stably cycling over 400 h with robust solid electrolyte interphases. On cathode sides, the cross-linked ion-conducting network is formed inside the cathode, and the intimate contact is built at cathode/garnet interface, arousing remarkable cycling and rate performance for LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4/Li and LiFePO4/Li cells at 30 °C. Furthermore, the soft GPE can be used as adhesive to connect garnet blocks together without gaps, enabling the construction of flexible and large-scale solid batteries, in which the GPE functions as deformable medium to induce the bending and coiling of solid batteries. This work demonstrates a promising strategy to address both the rigidity and brittleness issues of garnets by utilizing the in-situ solidified multifunctional GPEs.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106498
Blocking lithium dendrite growth in solid-state batteries with an ultrathin amorphous Li-La-Zr-O solid electrolyte,"© 2021, The Author(s).Lithium dendrites have become a roadblock in the realization of solid-state batteries with lithium metal as high-capacity anode. The presence of surface and bulk defects in crystalline electrolytes such as the garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) facilitates the growth of these hazardous lithium filaments. Here we explore the amorphous phase of LLZO as a lithium dendrite shield owing to its grain-boundary-free microstructure, stability against lithium metal, and high electronic insulation. By tuning the lithium stoichiometry, the ionic conductivity can be increased by 4 orders of magnitude while retaining a negligible electronic conductivity. In symmetric cells, plating-stripping shows no signs of lithium penetration up to 3.2 mA cm−2. The dense conformal nature of the films enables microbatteries with an electrolyte thickness of only 70 nm, which can be cycled at 10C for over 500 cycles. The application of this material as a coating on crystalline LLZO lowers the interface resistance and increases the critical current density. The effectiveness of the amorphous Li-La-Zr-O as dendrite blocking layer can accelerate the development of better solid-state batteries.",Communications Materials,10.1038/s43246-021-00177-4
A thin and flexible solid electrolyte templated by controllable porous nanocomposites toward extremely high performance all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Composite solid-state electrolytes (CSEs) with high ionic conductivity and low interfacial resistance have been pursued for next‐generation high energy density all solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASSLIBs). Herein, we report a novel strategy of developing thin, flexible, and conductive CSEs by using lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) to regulate pore characteristics of cellulose nanofibril (CNF) film template. The CNF-LNP film was first prepared, then LNPs were removed, thanks to the excellent LNP solubility in γ-Valerolactone (GVL), resulting in the formation of uniform and porous cellulose nanofibril (CNF) film, which is then utilized for preparing Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) membrane, with a superior morphological architecture (pore size, uniformity). Poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) is then infiltrated into the membrane, producing thin, flexible, and conductive CSEs. Due to the controllable interconnected architecture of LLZO membrane from the LNP regulated CNF film template and its good compatibility with PEO, the as-prepared CSEs exhibit a high lithium ionic conductivity of 1.83 × 10−4 S cm−1 at ambient temperature. The continuous and uniform lithium transfer pathways, with excellent electrolyte/electrode interface contact contribute to long-term cycling stability of symmetric lithium batteries. Hence, the assembled ASSLIBs from the as-prepared CSEs show high discharge specific capacities of 157 and 159.5 mAh g−1 with LiFePO4 and LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 respectively, with attractive cycling stabilities and capacity retention at ambient temperature.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.130632

Boosting the Electrochemical Performance of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2by Rough Coating with the Superionic Conductor Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Li-rich Mn-based layered compounds have progressed as promising cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their relatively low cost, considerable energy storage capacity, and high operating voltage. However, they suffer critical drawbacks, such as capacity decay and inferior rate performance, which restrain their real applications. We carried out surface modification via rough coating of superionic conductor Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) on the Li-rich Mn-based layered cathode. The cathode with a LLZO coating exhibits significantly improved electrochemical performance, which mainly benefits from the enhanced Li-ion diffusion and reduced side reactions at electrode/electrolyte interfaces via effective coating of LLZO layer. This work provides a facile and efficient way to design Li-rich Mn-based cathodes for high-energy and stable LIBs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c14229
Storage of Lithium Metal: The Role of the Native Passivation Layer for the Anode Interface Resistance in Solid State Batteries,"© 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.To overcome current challenges of lithium metal anodes (LMAs), which hinder their wide industrial application, the chemical composition of the lithium metal surface is an important factor. Due to its high reactivity and depending on the pre-treatment during processing, lithium is covered with a passivation layer composed of mainly Li2CO3, LiOH, and Li2O, what is mostly neglected in later electrochemical studies. Here, we investigate the effect of storage time and conditions on the surface passivation layer of commercial lithium foils, based on lithium surface characterization with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, finding that only sealed pouch bags can prevent lithium surface changes effectively. Otherwise, the passivation layer thickness increases steadily, even in gloveboxes with a low degree of contaminations. Testing the stored lithium foils in solid-state batteries with LLZO as model solid electrolyte, it is demonstrated that the solid electrolyte roughness and the applied pressure have a huge impact on the obtained impedance. While the passivation layer has no major effect on the interface resistance with a rough LLZO pellet and at high pressure, it clearly affects the interface resistance with smoother LLZO surfaces and at lower pressure. Consequently, the lithium passivation layer may hinder the application of the LMA in a solid-state battery what we discuss in depth. By reactivity experiments with model lithium surfaces, we show that water residuals are the main reason for the aging of lithium foil in gloveboxes. Additionally, nitrogen reacts with fresh lithium surfaces and lithium foils with an incomplete or damaged passivation layer. The results demonstrate that storage conditions are important factors for the surface state of lithium metal and consequently for the application as an anode material.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.1c02481
Preparation Li7La3Zr2O12 garnet solid-state electrolyte by wet-chemical technique,"© 2021, Materials China. All rights reserved.Lithium-ion batteries are widely used as high energy density, long cycle life and green cleaning. However, lithium dendrite occurs easily in lithium-ion batteries with conditional leaky and volatile liquid electrolyte, which will cause short circuit and further danger. Solid-state electrolyte is nonflammable because most of them are inorganic material such as glass, ceramics and so on. Furthermore, solid-state has high ion conductivity at room temperature, wide electrochemical window, and extensive applicable temperature range. Therefore, it is very significant to replace traditional liquid electrolyte with solid-state electrolyte. Compared with other kinds of solid electrolytes, garnet oxide solid-state electrolyte Li7 La3 Zr2 O12 (LLZO) with high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window (>5V vs. Li/Li+), stability to lithium metal and thermostabilization is a very promising inorganic solid electrolyte. Sol-gel method and low temperature combustion method were used to prepare LLZO powder in this work. The ionic conductivity at 40℃ and activation energy of the electrolyte pellets prepared by two methods were 1.22×10−5 S/cm, 0.34eV and 3.87×10−6 S/cm, 0.32eV, respectively. The result shows that sol-gel is more likely to be selected to prepare LLZO powder.",Huagong Jinzhan/Chemical Industry and Engineering Progress,10.16085/j.issn.1000-6613.2021-1200
On the Origin of Zero Interface Resistance in the Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12|Li0System: An Atomistic Investigation,"© 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.Understanding the nature of ion transfer at the interface between Li metal and solid electrolytes (SE) is essential for further optimization of all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. Thus, the Li transfer across the SE|Li metal interface is investigated by means of ab initio calculations based on density functional theory in this work. The aluminum-doped garnet Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is considered as a model SE due to its practical stability against Li metal. A low-energy interface model in bicrystal geometry is constructed and investigated by nudged elastic band calculations as well as ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. In order to distinguish between interface and bulk transport in the AIMD simulations, a post-processing protocol is developed. We find that the activation energies and diffusivities of Li are comparable in bulk LLZO and across the interface, substantiating that the interface kinetics are not rate-limiting. Moreover, electronic structure analysis indicates that charge transfer occurs gradually. Finally, Al3+ loss of LLZO at the interface rationalizes the experimentally observed phase transition from cubic to tetragonal observed close to Li metal contacts.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c15400
High-efficiency and low-cost preparation of solid electrolytes Li7La3Zr2O12 based on molten salt method,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has received widespread attention due to its excellent comprehensive properties. However, in order to realize its industrial application in all-solid-state lithium batteries, an efficient and low-cost preparation method must be developed. Herein, molten salt method is applied and the effect of sintering temperature, washing solvent and mother powder distribution on the microstructure and properties of LLZO are investigated. Results show that pure cubic LLZO can be obtained at 1250–1300 °C, the lithium loss phase La2Zr2O7 is generated at higher temperature of 1330 °C. The Li+ conductivity of LLZO obtained at 1300 °C with short time of 80 min reach 2.9 × 10−4 S cm−1. Secondly, compared with washing with deionized water, the LiO4 occupation reduced while the LiO6 occupation increased when washing with LiOH aqueous, representing an exchange of Li+/H+. The Li+ conductivity of LLZO washed with LiOH solution (6.53 × 10−5 S cm−1) is 76% lower than that of deionized water washing (2.73 × 10−4 S cm−1) which due to the excessive Li+ concentration. Besides, the Li+ conductivity of LLZO (2.57 × 10−5 S cm−1) obtained with mother powder of 2.5 g: 2.5 g is close to one order of magnitude lower than that with 4 g: 1 g (2.23 × 10−4 S cm−1) which is due to too much lithium loss through the upper surface. Excessive mother powder on the upper surface is beneficial to obtain cubic phase LLZO. The molten salt method greatly reduces the mixing time (less than 30 min) and sintering time (80 min) of materials which is an effective and low-cost method to achieve mass production.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160620
The preparation of Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) battery ceramic and its conductivity,"© Journal of Physics: Conference Series 2021.For Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolytes, higher density usually means higher ionic conductivity.

Cubic garnet solid polymer electrolyte for room temperature operable all-solid-state-battery,"© 2021 The Author(s)Solid polymer electrolytes are promising candidates for implementation in next-generation all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) which could replace conventional batteries used today. However, the materialization of ASSBs on a mass scale is restricted by the low ionic conductivity and high interfacial resistance of solid electrolytes. In this work, succinonitrile (SN) with lithium (trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Al-LLZO) nanoparticles were used to improve the ionic conductivity of a polyethylene oxide-based composite electrolyte. The Al-LLZO nanoparticles were synthesized by a facile synthesis process at low temperatures, which contributed to an enhancement in the ionic conductivity. A solid polymer electrolyte with 7.5 wt% of Al-LLZO and 15 wt% of SN achieved a high ionic conductivity of 4.17 × 10−4 Scm−1 at room temperature and a large value of 0.451 for the lithium-ion transport number at 60 °C. By adding 10 wt% SN and 10 wt% of Al-LLZO in the LiFePO4 cathode, the cell could operate at 25 °C with a specific capacity of 130 mAh g−1 and 89% capacity retention after 200 cycles at current density of 20 mA g−1.

Evaluation of scalable synthesis methods for aluminum-substituted li7la3zr2o12 solid electrolytes,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Solid electrolyte is the key component in all-solid-state batteries (ASBs). It is required in electrodes to enhance Li-conductivity and can be directly used as a separator. With its high Li-con-ductivity and chemical stability towards metallic lithium, lithium-stuffed garnet material Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is considered one of the most promising solid electrolyte materials for high-energy ceramic ASBs. However, in order to obtain high conductivities, rare-earth elements such as tantalum or niobium are used to stabilize the highly conductive cubic phase. This stabilization can also be obtained via high levels of aluminum, reducing the cost of LLZO but also reducing processa-bility and the Li-conductivity. To find the sweet spot for a potential market introduction of garnet-based solid-state batteries, scalable and industrially usable syntheses of LLZO with high processa-bility and good conductivity are indispensable. In this study, four different synthesis methods (solid-state reaction (SSR), solution-assisted solid-state reaction (SASSR), co-precipitation (CP), and spray-drying (SD)) were used and compared for the synthesis of aluminum-substituted LLZO (Al:LLZO, Li6.4Al0.2La3Zr2O12), focusing on electrochemical performance on the one hand and scala-bility and environmental footprint on the other hand. The synthesis was successful via all four meth-ods, resulting in a Li-ion conductivity of 2.0–3.3 × 10−4 S/cm. By using wet-chemical synthesis meth-ods, the calcination time could be reduced from two calcination steps for 20 h at 850 °C and 1000 °C to only 1 h at 1000 °C for the spray-drying method.

Structural and Chemical Compatibilities of Li1−xNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 Cathode Material with Garnet-Type Solid Electrolyte for All-Solid-State Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) based on ceramic materials are considered a key technology for automobiles and energy storage systems owing to their high safety and stability. However, contact issues between the electrode and solid-electrolyte materials and undesired chemical reaction occurring at interfaces have hindered their development. Herein, the chemical compatibility and structural stability of composite mixtures of the layered cathode materials Li1−xNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) with the garnet-type solid electrolyte Li6.25Ga0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO-Ga) during high-temperature co-sintering under various gas flowing conditions are investigated. In situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction analysis of the composite materials reveals that Li diffusion from LLZO-Ga to NCM523 occurs at high temperature under synthetic air atmosphere, resulting in the decomposition of LLZO-Ga into La2Zr2O7 and the recovery of charged NCM523 to the as-prepared state. The structural stability of the composite mixture at high temperature is further investigated under N2 atmosphere, revealing that Li diffuses toward the opposite direction and involves the phase transition of LLZO-Ga from a cubic to tetragonal structure and the reduction of the NCM523 cathode to Ni metal. These findings provide insight into the structural stability of layered cathode and garnet-type solid-electrolyte composite materials and the design of stable interfaces between them via co-sintering for ASSBs.",Small,10.1002/smll.202103306
A different zirconia precursor for Li7La3Zr2O12 synthesis,"© 2021 The AuthorsLi7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a promising solid electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries. Some studies on LLZO synthesis have been conducted without considering the crystal structure of ZrO2 as the main precursor. In this research, different-precursors have been used for LLZO synthesis which was a monoclinic ZrO2 powder (m-ZrO2) and tetragonal ZrO2 powder (t-ZrO2). The reaction was conducted at 950 °C 6 h and followed by sintering at 1000 °C 6 h under Argon gas flow. The result shows that LLZO made from m-ZrO2 (LLZO(A)) and t-ZrO2 (LLZO(B)) contains t-LLZO and c-LLZO which is surprisingly having a similar c/t ratio of 0.124–0.125. The LLZO(A) and LLZO(B) provide a silver blocking ionic conductivity of 1.245 x 10−6 Scm−1 and 1.647 x 10−6 Scm−1, respectively. In addition, LLZO(B) provides lower specific resistance than LLZO(A) in between LiCoO2 and meso-carbon microbeads (mcmb) electrodes. CV analysis of the symmetrical Li-LLZO(B)–Li cell shows an electrochemical potential of 3.3 V (vs Li/Li+) oxidation and 3.4 V reduction (vs Li/Li+). A time-based Galvanostatic charge–discharge to Li-LLZO(B)–Li shows a capacity drop after the 1st 40 cycles from 0.0383C/cm2 into 0.0303C/cm2 during the 2nd 40 cycles, and it remains stable up to 120 cycles. It confirms the long-term electrochemical stability of LLZO(B) which was produced from t-ZrO2. The solid-state reaction method provides less expensive production and environmentally friendly by the absence of organic solvent.",Journal of Materials Research and Technology,10.1016/j.jmrt.2021.09.064

But their poor ionic conductivity limits their widespread use. Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolytes have the potential of showing comparable ionic conductivities with commercially available electrolytes. However, its high ion conductive cubic phase is not stable at room temperature. Studies demonstrated that the cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 phase can be stabilized easier than solid-state method by modified Pechini method and very little work has been done in order to understand what makes the phase transformation easier. For this purpose, thermal decomposition behavior, model-free kinetics and thermodynamics of Li7La3Zr2O12 xerogels synthesized by modified Pechini method were investigated and the effect of stabilizer (Al) addition was discussed in this study. The results showed the presence of four peak zones and the main reaction zone includes multiple reactions. Different statistical functions were tested for deconvolution of main reaction zone and the best fits were obtained by Bigaussian and Asym2sig statistical functions. The multiple reactions in the main thermal degradation zone were separated into three reaction zones and thermokinetic and thermodynamic calculations were employed using model-free approach. The results also showed that Al incorporation expanded the main thermal decomposition zone of LLZO and resulted in changes in kinetic and thermodynamic parameters.",Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry,10.1007/s10973-020-10462-y
Short-circuit mechanism induced by crack propagation spurred by inhomogeneous electric field in garnet-based solid electrolyte,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is well received as a solid electrolyte for batteries. Its excellent properties render the implementation of lithium (Li) metal batteries, leading to the improvement of the performances of the batteries. However, a short-circuit failure by Li propagation through the LLZO is a crucial issue and major obstacle for Li-based batteries to overcome. Here, we investigate various growth mechanism of Li penetration through the LLZO. Because of cracks on the surface, the electric field inside the batteries becomes inhomogeneous. Li ions gather near cracks to form lithium dendrites or they also get together along the grain boundaries of LLZO to form the dendrites. Thus, some dendrites grow through grain boundaries once the cracks propagate. If electric field becomes uniform at the interfaces by surface etching or laser treatment, Li dendrite propagation on cracks and/or grain boundaries can be avoided.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230389

Here, we report large specific surface area and coral-like cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) that was synthesized via a metal-organic framework (MOF) at a low calcination temperature (1000 °C). As active fillers, the coral-like cubic LLZO and lithium oxalyldifluroborate (LiODFB) uniformly distributed in a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) matrix provide an interconnected Li-ion transport channel in CSE, which manifests outstanding properties such as a favorable electrochemical stability window (of 4.85 V vs Li/Li+), high ionic conductivity (1.65 × 10-4 S cm-1, 20 °C), and superior interface compatibility with lithium metal. The assembled LiFePO4/CSE/Li and LiCoO2/CSE/Li cells convey predominate performance and initial specific capacities of 135.0 and 135.9 mA h g-1 at 0.5 C, with capacity retention values of 83.51% after 500 cycles and 93.90% after 200 cycles. The coral-like LLZO with a large specific area reduces polymer crystallinity and provides a large phase interface in CSE through interaction of LLZO with LiODFB and PVDF-HFP. The results suggest that coral-like LLZO prepared by MOFs is a promising filler in CSEs for solid-state lithium-ion batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.1c02217
Synergistic impacts of Ca2+ and Ta5+ dopants on electrical performance of garnet-type electrolytes,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) electrolytes co-doped with Ca2+ and Ta5+ dopants were produced successfully through solid method at 1230 °C for 1 h in ambient air atmosphere. The crystal structure, morphology, density and electrical performance of the Li6.4+xLa3–xCaxZr1.4Ta0.6O12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.08) and Li6.6+xLa3–xCaxZr1.6Ta0.4O12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.08) ceramics were characterized in detail. The synergistic effects of Ca2+ and Ta5+ dopants were explored. Attributed to the gaps of valence and ion radius between Ca2+ and La3+, the increasing concentration of transferable Li+ and the broader Li+ conduction pathway could be obtained in LLCZTO ceramics. A significantly improved electrical performance was achieved in the Li6.4+xLa3–xCaxZr1.4Ta0.6O12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.08) ceramics. Particularly, the specimen with the constituent of Li6.42La2.98Ca0.02Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 exhibited the highest ionic conductivity of 5.69 × 10[sbnd]4 S·cm[sbnd]1 as well as the lowest activation energy of 0.27 eV. Nevertheless, the excessively high Li+ concentration would result to inferior ionic conductivities instead ascribed to the serious abnormal grain growth inside the ceramics.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160420
Role of Filler Content and Morphology in LLZO/PEO Membranes,"© Copyright © 2021 Din, Häusler, Fischer, Ratzenböck, Chamasemani, Hanghofer, Henninge, Brunner, Slugovc and Rettenwander.Polymer electrolytes containing Li-ion conducting fillers are among the extensively investigated materials for the development of solid-state Li metal batteries. The practical realization of these electrolytes is, however, impeded by their low Li-ion conductivity, which is related to the filler and the interplay between the filler and the polymer. Therefore, we performed an in-depth analysis on the influence of the filler content (0, 10, and 20 wt%) and filler morphology (particles and nanowires) on the electrical and electrochemical properties of the PEO-based composite electrolyte using a wide spectrum of characterization techniques, such as 3D micro-X-ray computed tomography, cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry, impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic cycling. The studies reveal that the filler materials are well distributed within the membranes, without any indications for the formation of agglomerates. For 10 wt% filler, a decrease in the crystallinity compared to PEO was observed, in contrast to 20 wt% filler showing an increase in crystallinity. Impedance spectroscopic studies on the Li-ion conductivity of the membranes have shown that the change in the Li-ion conductivity is solely related to the change in the crystallinity, rather than to the participation of LLZO as an active transport mediator. The PEO membranes containing 10 wt% LLZO have been tested in terms of their rate capability in symmetrical Li cells by galvanostatic cycling. A critical current density of up to 1 mA cm−2 at 60°C was observed.",Frontiers in Energy Research,10.3389/fenrg.2021.711610
Garnet-type solid electrolyte: Advances of ionic transport performance and its application in all-solid-state batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s).All-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), which use solid electrolytes instead of liquid ones, have become a hot research topic due to their high energy and power density, ability to solve battery safety issues, and capabilities to fulfill the increasing demand for energy storage in electric vehicles and smart grid applications. Garnet-type solid electrolytes have attracted considerable interest as they meet all the properties of an ideal solid electrolyte for ASSLBs. The garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has excellent environmental stability; experiments and computational analyses showed that this solid electrolyte has a high lithium (Li) ionic conductivity (10−4–10−3 S·cm−1), an electrochemical window as wide as 6 V, stability against Li metal anode, and compatibility with most of the cathode materials. In this review, we present the fundamentals of garnet-type solid electrolytes, preparation methods, air stability, some strategies for improving the conductivity based on experimental and computational results, interfacial issues, and finally applications and challenges for future developments of LLZO solid electrolytes for ASSLBs.

Low temperature synthesis of Ga-doped Li7 La3 Zr2 O12 garnet-type solid electrolyte by mechanical method,"© 2021 The Society of Powder Technology JapanSynthesis of Li6.25 Ga0.25 La3 Zr2 O12 (LLZO-Ga) solid electrolyte powder granule for all solid-state battery was investigated by applying mechanical processing of the raw powder materials adding LiF-BaF2 as a flux. The LLZO-Ga of highly crystalline was synthesized by the mechanical method using an attrition-type mill without any extra-heat assistance. When 10 mass% of LiF-BaF2 was added to the raw powder materials and 28 min processed, LLZO-Ga powder was favorably synthesized and granulated at the chamber temperature of 284 °C. The ionic conductivity of the sintered body of the LLZO-Ga granules was evaluated by impedance measurement. It revealed the high ionic conductivity of σtotal 1.0 × 10−3 S/cm. It suggests that the formation of LLZO-Ga/BaZrO3 grain boundary contributes to higher ionic conductivity adding to the high crystalline phase of LLZO-Ga.",Advanced Powder Technology,10.1016/j.apt.2021.08.035
Building a Better Li-Garnet Solid Electrolyte/Metallic Li Interface with Antimony,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Energy Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbHThe deployment of Li-garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid-state electrolytes in solid-state batteries is severely hampered by their poor wettability with metallic Li. In this work, Sb is presented as a compelling interfacial layer allowing superior wetting of Li onto a LLZO surface, resulting in a remarkably low Li/LLZO interfacial resistance of 4.1(1) Ω cm2. An atomistic insight into Sb-coated LLZO interface using soft and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and focused ion beam time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry shows the formation of a Li-Sb alloy as an interlayer. It is determined that the Li/Sb-coated LLZO/Li symmetrical cells exhibit a high critical current density of up to 0.64 mA cm−2 and low overpotentials of 40–50 mV at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 without applying external pressure. The electrochemical performance of Sb coated-LLZO pellets is also assessed with an intercalation-type V2O5 cathode. Li/Sb-coated-LLZO/V2O5 full cells deliver stable capacities of around 0.45 mAh cm−2, with a peak current density of 0.3 mA cm−2.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202102086
Practical development and challenges of garnet-structured Li7La3Zr2O12 electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries: A review,"© 2021, University of Science and Technology Beijing.All-solid-state Li-ion batteries (ASSLIBs) have been widely studied to achieve Li-ion batteries (LIBs) with high safety and energy density. Recent reviews and experimental papers have focused on methods that improve the ionic conductivity, stabilize the electrochemical performance, and enhance the electrolyte/electrode interfacial compatibility of several solid-state electrolytes (SSEs), including oxides, sulfides, composite and gel electrolytes, and so on. Garnet-structured Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is highly regarded an SSE with excellent application potential. However, this type of electrolyte also possesses a number of disadvantages, such as low ionic conductivity, unstable cubic phase, and poor interfacial compatibility with anodes/cathodes. The benefits of LLZO have urged many researchers to explore effective solutions to overcome its inherent limitations. Herein, we review recent developments on garnet-structured LLZO and provide comprehensive insights to guide the development of garnet-structured LLZO-type electrolytes. We not only systematically and comprehensively discuss the preparation, element doping, structure, stability, and interfacial improvement of LLZOs but also provide future perspectives for these materials.

Computation-guided discovery of coating materials to stabilize the interface between lithium garnet solid electrolyte and high-energy cathodes for all-solid-state lithium batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.All-solid-state batteries with a lithium metal anode, enabled by lithium garnet solid electrolytes such as Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), are a promising next-generation energy-storage technology. The further development of all-solid-state battery requires the integration of high-energy cathodes such as LiNi1-x-yMnxCoyO2 (NMC) with the garnet solid electrolyte with stable and low-resistance interfaces, which requires a coating layer to stabilize the interface during high-temperature sintering and electrochemical cycling. In order to guide the future development of interfacial coatings, we perform high-throughput thermodynamic analyses based on first-principles computation to investigate the stability of LLZO garnet and high-energy NMC cathodes with a wide range of materials chemistries. Our study reveals the factors governing the materials stability with LLZO garnet and NMC cathodes, and identifies the mechanisms of good coating layers stable with LLZO and NMC. In addition to classifying known coating layers, our study provides detailed guiding charts and multiple new materials systems as promising coatings for stabilizing LLZO[sbnd]NMC interfaces to enable high-energy-density garnet-based all-solid-state batteries.

Experimental corroboration of theory for impedance response of solid electrolytes: Doped cubic garnet LLZO,"© 2021We corroborate phenomenological theory for the electrochemical impedance response of solid state electrolyte (SSE) with experimental data for the garnet structured oxide LLZO synthesized using conventional solid-state method. Theoretical analysis of experimentally recorded impedance spectrum indicates three characteristic frequency regimes, viz. (i) high frequency regime, ion relaxation dynamics in grain (g) and space charge layer (SCL) in grain boundary (gb) controls the impedance response, (ii) intermediate frequency regime, depicts the ion transfer and reorganization across heterogeneous grain and grain boundary and (iii) low frequency regime, response is attributed to the capacitive behavior due to the formation of double layer at solid electrolyte/partially blocking metal interface. Theory identifies phenomenological time scales associated with different electrochemical processes occurring in grain, grain boundary and their interface. The material characterization of samples is carried out using powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The characteristic phenomenological time scales are extracted from the impedance response of Ta-doped and Al-doped LLZO unraveling the influence of doping. Finally, theory provides an alternative approach as it has rigor of phenomenological ab initio methodology as well as captures the simplicity of equivalent circuit models.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry,10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.115611
Garnet to hydrogarnet: effect of post synthesis treatment on cation substituted LLZO solid electrolyte and its effect on Li ion conductivity,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.We investigated why commercial Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) with Nb- and Ta substitution shows very low mobility on a local scale, as observed with temperature-dependent NMR techniques, compared to Al and W substituted samples, although impedance spectroscopy on sintered pellets suggests something else: conductivity values do not show a strong dependence on the type of substituting cation. We observed that mechanical treatment of these materials causes a symmetry reduction from garnet to hydrogarnet structure. To understand the impact of this lower symmetric structure in detail and its effect on the Li ion conductivity, neutron powder diffraction and6Li NMR were utilized. Despite the finding that, in some materials, disorder can be beneficial with respect to ionic conductivity, pulsed-field gradient NMR measurements of the long-range transport indicate a higher Li+diffusion barrier in the lower symmetric hydrogarnet structure. The symmetry reduction can be reversed back to the higher symmetric garnet structure by annealing at 1100 °C. This unintended phase transition and thus a reduction in conductivity is crucial for the processing of LLZO materials in the fabrication of all-solid state batteries.",RSC Advances,10.1039/d1ra05961k
Cu-Doped Alloy Layer Guiding Uniform Li Deposition on a Li-LLZO Interface under High Current Density,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO)-based ceramics as promising solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have received much attention for use in high-energy lithium (Li) metal batteries. However, the Li growth through the solid garnet electrolyte under a low current density hinders its practical application. In this work, the Cu doped Li3Zn was designed to guide uniform Li deposition by magnetron cosputtering and an in situ alloying reaction on Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) pellets. After introducing the composite layer, a small interfacial area specific resistance (∼30 ω·cm2) can be obtained. Improved lithium plating/stripping performance, including a long-life span of 450 h (under a current density of 0.8 mA cm-2 without short circuit) and a high critical current density (CCD) of 2.8 mA cm-2 is performed by the composite interlayer with a Zn:Cu ratio of 10:1. And the Li/Cu-Li3Zn SSEs/LFP full cell exhibits good electrochemical performance. Accordingly, the Li deposited behavior in the Li plating/stripping process at the intermediate layer is discussed in detail. This work provides a new sight for the alloy interface designed on the solid-state garnet SSEs for high performance lithium metal batteries under high current density.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c11607
Characterization of the interfacial Li-ion exchange process in a ceramic-polymer composite by solid state NMR,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Solid-state electrolytes are key for the development of high energy density and safe Li-batteries. A very strong research effort has been made for the development of ceramic-polymer composite solid electrolytes that combine the high ionic conductivity of the ceramic phase with the ease of processability of the polymeric membrane. A crucial question for the development of such composite membranes is the detection and quantification of the Li-ion exchange processes existing at the interface between the polymer and ceramic particles. Using multidimensional solid-state NMR experiments, we unequivocally demonstrate and characterize in this work the Li-ion exchange process present in a PEO:LiTFSI-LLZO composite material. The exchange process is observed between bulk Li-ion populations in both phases, and is not only restricted to the exchange processes occurring at the interface. LiOH is detected in the composite material and its role in the polymer-ceramic Li-ion exchange process is discussed.

A glance at the influence of different dopant elements on Li7La3Zr2O12 garnets,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Lithium lanthanum zirconates (LLZOs) are a family of solid electrolytes that have been increasingly under development since 2007. The high-temperature cubic LLZO has been the focus of the study due to its excellent ionic conductivity, higher stability against electrodes, and ease of fabrication in comparison to other solid electrolytes. Many advancements have been achieved in this area; however, still, there is room for further improvements. Recent findings have suggested the idea of using supervalent dopants such as (Ba2+, Sr2+, Eu2+, Al3+, Ga3+, Gd3+, Fe3+ Sc3+, Sm3+, Y3+, Eu3+, Ge4+, Ce4+, Sb5+ Ta5+, Nb5+, and W6+) to tailor the properties of LLZOs and therefore, make them applicable in different areas such as all-solid-state batteries, solid oxide fuel cells, and electrochemical sensors. Many results concerning the structure and consequently, the site preference of compositional ions (Li+, La3+, and Zr4+) of LLZO electrolytes have been published in recent years, but the diversity is such high that might confuse the reader when choosing the right topic of study. Therefore, in this review, we are aiming to summarize, categorize, and clarify recent advances in cubic LLZO solid electrolytes. A further aim of this review is to give a more in-depth insight into the structure and, therefore, the origin of the ionic conductivity in cubic LLZO.",Ionics,10.1007/s11581-021-04152-4
S/MWCNt/LLZO composite electrode with e−/S/Li+ conductive network for all-solid -state Lithium–Sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Traditional liquid lithium-sulfur batteries have two key problems: poor safety and shuttle effect. These two challenges can be overcome by using solid-state electrolytes. But poor ionic and electronic conductivity due to solid/solid contact between the electrode and the electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs). Here, we have synthesized Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12(LLZO) conductive ceramics with high ionic conductivity. LLZO is used as the lithium-ion conductor and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNt) are used as the electronic conductor to form S/MWCNt/LLZO by the thermal diffusion method, resulting in an e−/S/Li+ conductive network. The prepared S/MWCNt/LLZO composite material, composite solid electrolyte, and lithium metal are assembled into ASSLSBs. After 50 cycles, the high capacity of 825 ​mAh·g−1 is maintained with 72.62% capacity retention at 0.2C and 45 ​°C. The higher capacity indicates the success of forming a conductive network that can improve the electrochemical performance of ASSLSBs. At 0.2C, the capacity of the S/MWCNt/LLZO composite cathode remains at 873 ​mAh·g−1 after 60 cycles when the operating temperature is increased to 60 ​°C, indicating good cycle performance.",Journal of Solid State Chemistry,10.1016/j.jssc.2021.122341
Ultra-low LPS/LLZO interfacial resistance – towards stable hybrid solid-state batteries with Li-metal anodes,"© 2021To enable solid-state batteries with Li metal anodes, different classes of electrolytes are being investigated, mainly polymers, oxides, and sulfides. To overcome individual drawbacks of the material classes, so called bilayer hybrid cells combining layers of different electrolyte materials are considered highly promising. However, the introduction of an additional interface between the two solid electrolytes raises the question of the corresponding interfacial resistance. Herein, the properties of the interface between the two promising electrolytes Al-LLZO (Li6.16Al0.28La3Zr2O12) and LPS (Li7P3S11) are investigated by comprehensive impedance analyses. A series of systematic measurements allows to deconvolute the pressure dependence of the resistances related to the LPS material and the LPS/LLZO interface. This analysis reveals a significant pressure dependence of the LPS/LLZO interfacial resistance, mainly attributed to constriction resistance. Optimization of the LPS/LLZO interface is carried out by targeted surface treatment, resulting in a dramatic decrease of the interfacial resistance to virtually zero. These mechanistic studies and optimization approaches are complemented by practically relevant cycling tests using Li-metal electrodes. The cells show excellent cycling stability and negligible degradation. These findings contribute to the fundamental understanding of solid-solid interfaces in bilayer hybrid cells, indicating that solid-state batteries with hybrid LPS/LLZO electrolytes appear highly promising.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2021.05.020
Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte sintered by the ultrafast high-temperature method,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdAll-solid-state Li batteries (ASSLBs) are regarded as the systems of choice for future electrochemical energy storage. Particularly, the garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is one of the most promising solid electrolytes due to its stability against Li metal. However, its integration into ASSLBs is challenging due to high temperature and long dwell time required for sintering. Advanced sintering techniques, such as Ultrafast High-temperature Sintering, have shown to significantly increase the sintering rate. Direct contact to graphite heaters allows sintering of LLZO within 10 s due to extremely high heating rates (up to 104 K min−1) and temperatures up to 1500 °C to a density around 80 %. The LLZO sintered in vacuum and Ar atmosphere has good mechanical stability and high phase purity, but kinetic de-mixing at the grain boundaries was observed. Nevertheless, the Li-ion conductivity of 1 mS cm−1 at 80 °C was comparable to conventional sintering, but lower than for Field-Assisted Sintering Technique/Spark Plasma Sintering.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.05.041
Three-dimensional alloy interface between Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 and Li metal to achieve excellent cycling stability of all-solid-state battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The interfacial issues between garnet electrolyte and Li metal hinder the application of garnet electrolyte in solid-state Li metal batteries. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) porous Zn layer (PZL) is magnetron sputtered on the surface of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) to construct a 3D Li–Zn alloy layer at the LLZTO/Li interface by melting Li metal into PZL. The 3D Li–Zn alloy effectively reduces the LLZTO/Li interfacial impedance from 319.8 Ω cm2 to an extremely low value of 1.9 Ω cm2. Meanwhile, the 3D alloy skeleton can enhance the transport kinetics and promote uniform distribution of Li ion at interface to inhibit the growth of Li dendrites. More importantly, the volume expansion of interface between LLZO and Li metal anode is effectively suppressed due to the host role of 3D Li–Zn alloy interface. The Li/LLZTO@PZL/Li symmetrical battery achieves a high critical current density of 2 mA cm−2 for one cycle. The all-solid-state LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523)/LLZTO@PZL/Li battery with a high cathode loading of 4.9 mg cm−2 delivers a high specific capacity of 143.8 mAh g−1 after 170 cycles.

Electrochemically-Matched and Nonflammable Janus Solid Electrolyte for Lithium-Metal Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Solid-state batteries based on ceramic electrolytes are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries with better safety and energy density. While solid electrolytes such as the garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) are chemically stable with lithium metal, their rigidity leads to poor interfacial contact with the cathodes. Nonflammable organic phosphates, however, are characterized by a liquid nature and can immerse the conventional porous cathodes to form a good contact. However, the phosphates are unstable with lithium metal anodes. We design a quasi-solid Janus electrolyte based on the ceramic LLZO and a trimethyl phosphate (TMP) gel which combines the best of both worlds. The electrochemical window of the Janus electrolyte is significantly extended compared with the TMP to accommodate the lithium metal anode. The contact between the cathode and the electrolyte is maintained by the semifluid nature of the TMP gel. A lithium-metal battery with such a Janus electrolyte can stably cycle at room temperature at 1C while still retaining a capacity of 115 mAh g-1 over 100 times. In contrast, the batteries based on LLZO and TMP individually cannot function properly. More importantly, despite the quasi-solid nature, the battery does not contain flammable functional parts and can alleviate the safety concerns of current batteries containing organic-type electrolytes. This work provides a simple but effective strategy for safe, inexpensive, and energy-dense solid-state batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c08687
"Flexible, Mechanically Robust, Solid-State Electrolyte Membrane with Conducting Oxide-Enhanced 3D Nanofiber Networks for Lithium Batteries","© 2021 American Chemical Society.Using a three-dimensional (3D) Li-ion conducting ceramic network, such as Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet-type oxide conductor, has proved to be a promising strategy to form continuous Li ion transfer paths in a polymer-based composite.

Isomeric Li-La-Zr-O Amorphous-Crystalline Composite Thin-Film Electrolytes for All-Solid-State Lithium Batteries,"© Amorphous Li-La-Zr-O (LLZO) solid-state electrolyte thin films are promising alternatives to the well-established lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium batteries due to their potentially higher Li-ion conductivity and stability. Herein, the enhancement methodology in the ionic conductivity of amorphous LLZO-based thin films is investigated. By doping with Ta, the conductivity of the amorphous LLZO film at 30 °C (3.9 × 10-7 S cm-1) can be enhanced by up to an order of magnitude (2.6 × 10-6 S cm-1), ascribed to tuning Li conduction in local near-order LLZO nanodomains. On that basis, an isomeric Li-La-Zr-Ta-O (LLZTO) amorphous-crystalline composite thin film is prepared via incorporating cubic LLZTO particles into the amorphous LLZTO matrix. The composite film with 10 wt % cubic LLZTO filler can further achieve an ionic conductivity of 0.8 × 10-5 S cm-1 at 30 °C, which is comparable to the best values obtained for the state-of-Art LLZO-based thin films. Li transport through the well-connected cubic LLZTO filler network and along the interfaces between the crystallites and the amorphous matrix in the LLZTO composite thin film may offer fast and long-range Li-conduction pathways, which supplement the ionic conduction in the amorphous matrix with short-range-ordered and long-range-disordered structures.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.1c01710
A Sandwich-Structure Composite Polymer Electrolyte Based on Poly(vinyl alcohol)/Poly(4-lithium styrene sulfonic acid) for High-Voltage Lithium Batteries,"© High-performance all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries (ASSLMBs) require solid electrolytes displaying high electrochemical stability, high ion conductivity, a high lithium transference number, excellent compatibility with the electrodes, and the ability to work at room temperature. In this study, we used a solution-casting technique to prepare a flexible composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) having a high lithium transference number and applied it within ASSLMBs. The CPE comprised a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/poly(4-lithium styrene sulfonic acid) (PLSS) blend with an Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) filler sandwiched on both sides by poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP)-lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) skin layers. The PVDF-HFP-LiTFSI skin layers not only lowered the interfacial resistance between the electrodes and the sandwich-CPE electrolyte but also suppressed lithium dendrite growth. The sandwich-CPE membrane exhibited high ionic conductivity (3.82 × 10-4 S cm-1) and a high lithium transference number (0.776) at room temperature. A CR2032 coin cell having the structure Li/sandwich-CPE/LMO@T-LNCM811 delivered excellent rate performance and cycle stability (discharge capacity of 130.55 mA h g-1 with 85.63% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a rate of 0.5C at room temperature). A pouch cell having the structure Li/sandwich-CPE/LMO@T-LNCM811 achieved a discharge capacity of 18.1 mA h with a capacity retention of 90.46% after 30 cycles at 0.2C at room temperature. This strategy for fabricating sandwich-CPE structures has potential for application in the preparation of high-voltage cathodes for ASSLMBs.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.1c01333
Immobilizing Ceramic Electrolyte Particles into a Gel Matrix Formed in Situ for Stable Li-Metal Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Hybrid solid/gel electrolytes (SGEs) have generated much research attentions because of their capability to suppress Li dendrite growth and improve battery safety. However, the interfacial compatibility of the electrode/electrolyte or polymer/inorganic ceramics within hybrid electrolytes remains challenging for practical applications. Herein, an SGE is fabricated by confining ceramic particles (Li7La3Zr2O12; LLZO) into in situ formed tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (G4)-based gel electrolytes within assembled cells. A hierarchical layered structure is formed when LLZO settles near the Li anode within the liquid electrolyte during the gradual gelatinization process. Good interfacial compatibility is obtained from good contact with the liquid G4 component. The LLZO layer also serves as an ionic sieve to redistribute the Li deposition. This SGE endows stable Li stripping/plating cycling over 800 h at 0.5 mA/cm2 (60 °C). Moreover, Li-metal batteries with an SGE coupled with LiFePO4 and an air cathode both exhibit superior cycling performance.

Al-doped LLZO (Al-LLZO) has been widely studied due to the low cost of Al2O3. The reported ionic conductivities were variable due to the complicated Al3+-Li+ substitution and LixAlOy segregation in Al-LLZO ceramics. This work prepared Li7−3xAlxLa3Zr2O12 (x = 0.00~0.40) ceramics via a conventional solid-state reaction method. The AC impedance and corresponding distribution of relaxation times (DRT) were analyzed combined with phase transformation, cross-sectional microstructure evolution, and grain boundary element mapping results for these Al-LLZO ceramics to understand the various ionic transportation levels in LLZO with different Al-doping amounts. The low conductivity in low Al-doped (0.12~0.28) LLZO originates from the slow Li+ ion migration (1.4~0.25 μs) in the cubic-tetragonal mixed phase. On the other hand, LiAlO2 and LaAlO3 segregation occur at the grain boundaries of high Al-doped (0.40) LLZO, resulting in a gradual Li+ ion jump (6.5 μs) over grain boundaries and low ionic conductivity. The Li6.04Al0.32La3Zr2O12 ceramic delivers the optimum Li+ ion conductivity of 1.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.04.295
Improving Li/garnet interface by amorphous SnO2 interlayerdeposited via sol–gel method,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Garnet-type electrolytes (LLZO) have received increasing attention due to their high ion conductivity and good compatibility with Li anode. However, LLZO-based solid state batteries are hindered by the poor interface contact between Li metal and electrolytes. To this end, a 1.5 μm-thick amorphous SnO2layer has been deposited ontogarnet pellet via facile sol–gel method to improve its wettability with Li metal. By introducing the layer, the Li/LLZTO interface resistance is reduced from 1470 Ω cm2 to 38 Ω cm2. The Li/LLZTO/Li symmetric cell shows good cycling performance at 0.1 mA cm−2 for over 800 h.",Materials Letters,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.129959
Facile synthesis of Al-stabilized lithium garnets by a solution-combustion technique for all solid-state batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Garnet-type solid electrolytes with cubic modification (c-LLZO, Li7La3Zr2O12) are considered to be one of the most promising candidates for SSLBs with desirable properties such as high ionic conductivity (about 1 mS cm-1) at room temperature, a wide electrochemical operational window, and good stability against reduction by Li metal. The synthesis and processing of garnets through conventional wet-chemical, solid-state reaction and nitrate-combustion approaches often requires one or more of the following processing conditions (energy intensive milling steps, multiple and long periods of calcination) to attain a conductive cubic phase making synthesis time intensive. Herein, we report a facile fuel-assisted solution combustion method using carbohydrazide-nitrate mixtures to synthesize cubic-Li6.28Al0.24La3Zr2O12 (Al-LLZO); compared to other nitrate-combustion approaches, utilizing a nitrogen containing fuel source (CH6N4O) offers drastic reduction in the synthesis duration at relatively low temperatures. Selection of the right fuel to oxidizer ratio and annealing conditions is found to be critical for attaining phase purity and particle growth size of LLZO powders. Cubic phase Al-LLZO with a particle size of up to ∼200 nm was attained at temperatures as low as 800 °C upon calcining the as-combusted powders for 4 h. The green pellets attained high relative densities of 90-92% and ionic conductivities up to 0.45 mS cm-1 at low sintering conditions of 1100 °C for 6 h compared to longer sintering duration (∼10-24 h) for LLZO prepared with a common solid-state reaction or wet chemical methods using conventional pressure-less sintering methods. Sintered pellets exhibited a low activation energy of 0.29 eV likely due to the low grain boundary resistance. Synthesizing sub-micron sized Al-LLZO powders through low-cost facile synthesis approaches is of great importance in the fabrication of composite electrolytes and catholytes.",Materials Advances,10.1039/d1ma00393c
Effect of Sintering on Structural Modification and Phase Transition of Al-Substituted LLZO Electrolytes for Solid State Battery Applications,"© 2021 by ASMEOwing to high lithium ion conductivity and good stability with lithium metal, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO-a solid electrolyte) has emerged as a viable candidate for solid-state battery applications. In the current study, Al-substituted LLZO (Al-LLZO) powder is synthesized using a typical solid-state reaction. The pellets are made with the synthesized powder and are subjected to annealing for different durations and its effect on the structural properties of the Al-LLZO is investigated in detail. Reitveld refinement of the powder X-ray diffraction pattern reveals that the sintered Al-LLZO belong to the cubic system with the Ia-3d space group at room temperature. Morphology and microstructural properties of sintered powder are analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)/selected area electron diffraction (SAED), respectively. The FESEM image of LLZO pellets shows well-structured cubic grains spread evenly over on the surface after sintering. The chemical compositions of the sample are identified using energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The surface chemistry of the prepared samples is examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which states that the observed photoelectron signals from O 1s at about 531 eV and Li1s at 54.52 eV correspond to the Li-O bond in Al-LLZO. Raman spectra have been analyzed and the observed Raman peaks appearing at 299 cm−1, 393 cm−1, 492 cm−1, and 514 cm−1 were assigned to Eg, F2g, A1g, and F2g, respectively. Phase transformation from C-LLZO to the pyrochore LZO phase is noticed when the sample is sintered for 12 h at 1100 °C. The impedance analysis is carried out to measure the conductivity of the Al-LLZO pellet and is found to be 0.3 × 10−5 S cm−1, which is suitable for solid electrolyte applications in lithium ion batteries.",Journal of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage,10.1115/1.4049573
Decomposition of Trace Li2CO3 During Charging Leads to Cathode Interface Degradation with the Solid Electrolyte LLZO,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHA major challenge for lithium-containing electrochemical systems is the formation of lithium carbonates. Solid-state electrolytes circumvent the use of organic liquids that can generate these species, but they are still susceptible to Li2CO3 formation from exposure to water vapor and carbon dioxide. It is reported here that trace quantities of Li2CO3, which are re-formed following standard mitigation and handling procedures, can decompose at high charging potentials and degrade the electrolyte–cathode interface. Operando electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC–MS) is employed to monitor the outgassing of solid-state batteries containing the garnet electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and using appropriate controls CO2 and O2 are identified to emanate from the electrolyte–cathode interface at charging potentials > 3.8 V (vs Li/Li+). The gas evolution is correlated with a large increase in cathode interfacial resistance observed by potential-resolved impedance spectroscopy. This is the first evidence of electrochemical decomposition of interfacial Li2CO3 in garnet cells and suggests a need to report “time-to-assembly” for cell preparation methods.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202103716
Uniform and Anisotropic Solid Electrolyte Membrane Enables Superior Solid-State Li Metal Batteries,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHRational structure design is a successful approach to develop high-performance composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) for solid-state Li metal batteries. Herein, a novel CSE membrane is proposed, that consists of interwoven garnet/polyethylene oxide-Li bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LLZO/PEO-LiTFSI) microfibers. This CSE exhibits high Li-ion conductivity and exceptional Li dendrite suppression capability, which can be attributed to the uniform LLZO dispersion in PEO-LiTFSI and the vertical/horizontal anisotropic Li-ion conduction in the CSE. The uniform LLZO particles can generate large interaction regions between LLZO and PEO-LiTFSI, which thus form continuous Li-ion transfer pathways, retard the interfacial side reactions and strengthen the deformation resistance. More importantly, the anisotropic Li-ion conduction, that is, Li-ion transfers much faster along the microfibers than across the microfibers, can effectively homogenize the electric field distribution in the CSE during cycling, which thus prevents the excessive concentration of Li-ion flux. Finally, solid-state Li||LiFePO4 cells based on this CSE show excellent electrochemical performances. This work enriches the structure design strategy of high-performance CSEs and may be helpful for further pushing the solid-state Li metal batteries towards practical applications.",Advanced Science,10.1002/advs.202100899
Unveiling the presence of mixed oxidation states of Europium in Li7+δEuxLa3−δZr2−δO12−δ garnet and its impact on the Li-ion conductivity,"© 2021 The American Ceramic SocietyRecently, lanthanides have been employed by researchers to examine their impact on the structure and properties of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnets. In this regard, we developed Europium oxide (Eu2O3) doped LLZO (Li7+δEuxLa3−δZr2−δO12−δ) solid electrolyte which demonstrates a cubic phase with the symmetry of Ia (Formula presented.) d (No.230) at room temperature. In this investigation, different concentrations of Eu ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 atoms per formula unit (pfu) were doped into Li7La3Zr2O12 to evaluate the impact of Eu on the stability of the cubic phase and thereby the ionic conductivity. The results unveiled that upon doping Eu3+ ions, the Eu2+ state is also formed and is then self-doped into the structure in which Rietveld refinement coupled with XPS, EPR, and solid-state NMR suggests that Eu3+ ions most probably partially occupy Zr4+ (16a) site, the Eu2+ ions occupy La3+ (24d) site, and the Li+ ions occupy two different sites (24d and 96h). It was further found that such a site preference induces distortion at LaO8 polyhedrons opening up the neck for Li-ions diffusion, thereby enhancing the ionic conductivity. Moreover, it was revealed that Li-ions probably hop from 96h to 24d and then to 96h site to generate the Li-ion movement. Overall, by introducing Eu ions into the LLZO structure, an enhanced bulk ionic conductivity of 0.30 × 10−3 S/cm at 298 K with a minimum electronic conductivity of 2.547 × 10−9 S/cm at 298 K was achieved.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1111/jace.17846
Unraveling the mechanism of ion and electron migration in composite solid-state electrolyte using conductive atomic force microscopy,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) which formed a flexible interface with electrodes are considered as promising electrolytes candidates for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). However, the role of inorganic particles and migration of Li-ions still need to be investigated. Herein, LLZO-PEO composite electrolyte is prepared with different weight ratios (0, 50, 75 wt. %) of LLZO and in-situ conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) is employed to observe the changes in electrolyte topography and mechanical properties at different temperatures. Furthermore, c-AFM provides novel insights into the inhomogeneous migration of ions and electrons within the electrolyte. At high temperatures, Li-ions migrate along the amorphous PEO interphase of 0 and 50 wt. % LLZO-PEO electrolytes. With the increase of LLZO content (75 wt. %), LLZO particles form a continuous ionic network and Li-ions migrate through the LLZO particles. At low temperatures, Li-ions can only migrate along the amorphous PEO. Also, the addition of LLZO inhibits the migration of electrons and improves the insulative properties of the composite electrolyte. The current work provides novel insights into the design and development of composite electrolytes for next-generation ASSBs.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2021.04.028
Modified Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and LLZO-polymer composites for solid-state lithium batteries,"© 2021The solid-state lithium battery (SSLB) is recognized as the most promising candidate for energy storage devices with good safety and high energy density. The solid-state electrolyte (SSE), as the most critical component of solid-state lithium batteries (SSLBs), largely leads the future battery development. To obtain the SSE with good overall performance is a significant prerequisite to realize the application of SSLBs. Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) family solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have great potential for SSLBs, owing to high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical stability window and excellent stability against lithium metal. Achieving cubic modified LLZO of high quality is always an extremely important task in LLZO engineering. Numerous works on LLZO family SSEs and their extensions have been tried, and plenty of breakthrough results are achieved. However, these electrolytes and their SSLBs still suffer from quite a few pivotal problems for a real business.

Robust Conversion-Type Li/Garnet interphases from metal salt solutions,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) electrolytes show considerable potentials in solid-state Li metal batteries, yet the serious interfacial problem has hindered its practical application. Herein, we propose a facile strategy to construct conversion-type metal oxides (eg. PbO, ZnO or Co3O4) as lithiophilic layers on garnet surface from metal salt aqueous solutions. Robust garnet/Li interface and greatly reduced interfacial resistance to as small as ~ 10 Ω cm2 can be obtained. Combined with experimental analysis and theoretical calculation (ΔG), the mechanism of lithiophilicity of different metal oxides was explained. The mixed ionic and electronic conductive interlayer which can lead to uniform Li-ion flow is superior to the electronic conductive metal interlayer with poor ionic conductivity causing gradual failure of the interface. As expected, the Li|PbO/LLZTO/PbO|Li cells show the improved critical current density of 1.1 mA cm−2 and excellent cycling stability for 1000 h at 0.3 mA cm−2. With PbO modified garnet, LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2|garnet|Li cells operate well at room temperature and all-solid-state LiFePO4/PEO|garnet|Li cells run stably at 0.3 mA cm−2 for at least 100 cycles at 60 ℃.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.129158

Effect of sintering on the crystallographic structure, morphology, total conductivity, relative density and contractibility rate of the prepared solid electrolyte was studied, respectively. The sintered samples were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) techniques, respectively. The cubic garnet phase Ba, Y and Al co-doped LLZO is obtained, and the room-temperature total conductivity of the Ba, Y and Al co-doped LLZO solid electrolyte is improved significantly by eliminating the grain boundary resistances and improving the densifications with controlling sintering temperature (T) and time (t), respectively.

Investigation of Delamination-Induced Performance Decay at the Cathode/LLZO Interface,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.The growing interest in solid-state batteries has resulted in increased focus on the issue of delamination at the cathode/solid-state electrolyte (SSE) interface. The extent of delamination, and its impact on impedance rise and capacity fade, is determined by a number of material properties, including cathode molar volume change and state-of-charge dependence, mechanical properties of the cathode and SSE, SSE grain boundary microstructure, fracture threshold of the interface, and interfacial exchange current density. The goal of this paper is to develop multiscale mathematical models to link these material properties to performance and provide guidance on possible approaches to minimize delamination, impedance rise, and capacity fade. We examine two cathodes, namely, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 with a positive molar volume change and LiCoO2 with a negative molar volume change against a Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) SSE. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to determine fundamental material properties at the interface, while mesoscale models are used to link these properties to macroscopic performance. Model results suggest that SSEs with smaller grains and low Young's modulus and cathodes with low molar volume changes provide opportunities for minimizing delamination.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c04656
Investigating the electrochemical stability of Li7La3Zr2O12solid electrolytes using field stress experiments,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Cubic Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) garnets are among the most promising solid electrolytes for solid-state batteries with the potential to exceed conventional battery concepts in terms of energy density and safety. The electrochemical stability of LLZO is crucial for its application, however, controversial reports in the literature show that it is still an unsettled matter. Here, we investigate the electrochemical stability of LLZO single crystals by applying electric field stressviamacro- and microscopic ionically blocking Au electrodes in ambient air. Induced material changes are subsequently probed using various locally resolved analysis techniques, including microelectrode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and microfocus X-ray diffraction (XRD). Our experiments indicate that LLZO decomposes at 4.1-4.3 Vvs.Li+/Li, leading to the formation of Li-poor phases like La2Zr2O7beneath the positively polarized electrode. The reaction is still on-going even after several days of polarization, indicating that no blocking interfacial layer is formed. The decomposition can be observed at elevated as well as room temperature and suggests that LLZO is truly not compatible with high voltage cathode materials.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta02983e
In situelectron holography for characterizing Li ion accumulation in the interface between electrode and solid-state-electrolyte,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.An intensive understanding of the Li-ion transport mechanism in solid-state-electrolytes (SSEs) is crucial for the buildup of industrially scalable solid-state batteries.

The reconstructed phase image unravels the behavior of Li ions beneath the electrode during the charging process.

Design of triple and quadruple phase boundaries and chemistries for environmental SO2electrochemical sensing,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Air pollution is a major environmental risk to the health of humans and vegetation, leading to increasing demand for real-time monitoring of toxins and harmful pollutants. Recently, the first type III electrochemical sensors tracking lethal concentrations of SO2were developed based on a fast-conducting Li garnet Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) solid electrolyte. Despite the successful proof-of-concept demonstration, the ideal sensing electrode issues concerning its preferred microstructure and chemistry remain unresolved as no catalysts are involved to ensure the low cost of such future devices. The challenging task to secure an efficient ionic, electronic, and gas pathways are needed for further sensor performance improvement. Here, the focus was placed on manipulating the electrochemical reaction zones from triple phase boundaries (TPBs) to quadrupole phase boundaries (QPBs) by merely changing the processing temperature of a Li2SO4-CaSO4composite sensing electrode. The intended manipulation enforced the desired shift from TPB to QPB reaction zones and unlocked a larger effective surface area for the electrochemical reaction. The sensor operated at 480 °C with up to one-order-of-magnitude-lowered response time and up to a 75% decrease in the recovery time down to ∼5 min for the QPB-based configuration compared to the TPB-based one. This study demonstrates novel tools and strategies to favorably engineer sensing reaction zones through electrode processing techniques and enrich the functionality of the Li-garnet Li7La3Zr2O12fast-conducting electrolyte for sensing applications beyond batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta02399c
Unveiling Interfacial Li-Ion Dynamics in Li7La3Zr2O12/PEO(LiTFSI) Composite Polymer-Ceramic Solid Electrolytes for All-Solid-State Lithium Batteries,"© Unlocking the full potential of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) is key to enabling safer and more-energy dense technologies than today's Li-ion batteries. In particular, composite materials comprising a conductive, flexible polymer matrix embedding ceramic filler particles are emerging as a good strategy to provide the combination of conductivity and mechanical and chemical stability demanded from SSEs. However, the electrochemical activity of these materials strongly depends on their polymer/ceramic interfacial Li-ion dynamics at the molecular scale, whose fundamental understanding remains elusive. While this interface has been explored for nonconductive ceramic fillers, atomistic modeling of interfaces involving a potentially more promising conductive ceramic filler is still lacking. We address this shortfall by employing molecular dynamics and enhanced Monte Carlo techniques to gain unprecedented insights into the interfacial Li-ion dynamics in a composite polymer-ceramic electrolyte, which integrates polyethylene oxide plus LiN(CF3SO2)2 lithium imide salt (LiTFSI), and Li-ion conductive cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) inclusions. Our simulations automatically produce the interfacial Li-ion distribution assumed in space-charge models and, for the first time, a long-range impact of the garnet surface on the Li-ion diffusivity is unveiled. Based on our calculations and experimental measurements of tensile strength and ionic conductivity, we are able to explain a previously reported drop in conductivity at a critical filler fraction well below the theoretical percolation threshold. Our results pave the way for the computational modeling of other conductive filler/polymer combinations and the rational design of composite SSEs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c07029
Working Principle of an Ionic Liquid Interlayer During Pressureless Lithium Stripping on Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) Garnet-Type Solid Electrolyte,"© 2021 The Authors. Batteries & Supercaps published by Wiley-VCH GmbHSolid-state-batteries employing lithium metal anodes promise high theoretical energy and power densities. However, morphological instability occurring at the lithium/solid–electrolyte interface when stripping and plating lithium during cell cycling needs to be mitigated. Vacancy diffusion in lithium metal is not sufficiently fast to prevent pore formation at the interface above a certain current density during stripping. Applied pressure of several MPa can prevent pore formation, but this is not conducive to practical application. This work investigates the concept of ionic liquids as “self-adjusting” interlayers to compensate morphological changes of the lithium anode while avoiding the use of external pressure. A clear improvement of the lithium dissolution process is observed as it is possible to continuously strip more than 70 μm lithium (i. e., 15 mAh cm−2 charge) without the need for external pressure during assembly and electrochemical testing of the system. The impedance of the investigated electrodes is analyzed in detail, and contributions of the different interfaces are evaluated. The conclusions are corroborated with morphology studies using cryo-FIB-SEM and chemical analysis using XPS. This improves the understanding of the impedance response and lithium stripping in electrodes employing liquid interlayers, acting as a stepping-stone for future optimization.",Batteries and Supercaps,10.1002/batt.202100015

"Aging behavior of al- and ga- stabilized li7la3zr2o12 garnet-type, solid-state electrolyte based on powder and single crystal x-ray diffraction","© 2021 by the authors.Li7La3Zr2O12 garnet (LLZO) belongs to the most promising solid electrolytes for the development of solid-state Li batteries. The stability of LLZO upon exposure to air is still a matter of discussion. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive study on the aging behavior of Al-stabilized LLZO (space group (SG) Ia3d) and Ga-stabilized LLZO (SG I43d) involving 98 powder and 51 single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements. A Li+/H+ exchange starts immediately on exposure to air, whereby the exchange is more pronounced in samples with smaller particle/single-crystal diameter. A slight displacement of Li from interstitial Li2 (96h) toward the regular tetrahedral Li1 (24d) sites occurs in Al-stabilized LLZO. In addition, site occupancy at the 96h site decreases as Li+ is exchanged by H+. More extensive hydration during a mild hydrothermal treatment of samples at 90 C induces a structural phase transition in Al-LLZO to SG I43d with a splitting of the 24d site into two independent tetrahedral sites (i.e., 12a and 12b), whereby Al3+ solely occupies the 12a site. Li+ is preferably removed from the interstitial 48e site (equivalent to 96h). Analogous effects are observed in Ga-stabilized LLZO, which has SG I43d in the pristine state.",Crystals,10.3390/cryst11070721
Spray flame synthesis (Sfs) of lithium lanthanum zirconate (llzo) solid electrolyte,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A spray-flame reaction step followed by a short 1-h sintering step under O2 atmosphere was used to synthesize nanocrystalline cubic Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). The as-synthesized nanoparticles from spray-flame synthesis consisted of the crystalline La2Zr2O7 (LZO) pyrochlore phase while Li was present on the nanoparticles’ surface as amorphous carbonate. However, a short annealing step was sufficient to obtain phase pure cubic LLZO. To investigate whether the initial mixing of all cations is mandatory for synthesizing nanoparticulate cubic LLZO, we also synthesized Li free LZO and subsequently added different solid Li precursors before the annealing step. The resulting materials were all tetragonal LLZO (I41 /acd) instead of the intended cubic phase, suggesting that an intimate intermixing of the Li precursor during the spray-flame synthesis is mandatory to form a nanoscale product. Based on these results, we propose a model to describe the spray-flame based synthesis process, considering the precipitation of LZO and the subsequent condensation of lithium carbonate on the particles’ surface.",Materials,10.3390/ma14133472

Similarly, the transport properties at the metal anode interface are critically important, but not well understood. We propose a methodology for obtaining lithium diffusion coefficients of bulk solid ceramic garnet-Type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) electrolytes by coupling dense pellets with isotopically labelled lithium metal, followed by analysis with focused-ion-beam secondary ion mass spectrometry. We report room temperature lithium diffusivities of 2 8 × 10-13 m2 s-1 for doped LLZO using an estimate of the lithium diffusion length in good agreement with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Simultaneous detection of positive and negative secondary ion species by SIMS enables correlation of layered interfaces consisting of metallic lithium, corrosion/surface degradation products and bulk LLZO during depth profiling. Charging of the ceramic during ion sputtering is investigated and shown to have a minimal effect on the obtained lithium isotopic fractions in the current setup. Additionally, the effect of the presence of corrosion products at the surface of garnets as a result of air-exposure is investigated. This method could be extended to any Li-metal stable solid electrolyte, or with a reactive solid electrolyte coupled with a stable interlayer. As such, this work sets the basis of a methodology for further quantitative diffusion analyses for Li-conducting solid ceramic electrolytes and their interfaces with electrodes, as used in both solid-state lithium batteries and hybrid systems coupling solid and liquid electrolytes.",JPhys Energy,10.1088/2515-7655/abe2f7
An assessment of a mechanism for void growth in Li anodes,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe formation of dendrites within the solid-state electrolyte of a Lithium (Li) ion battery is exacerbated by the presence of voids at the interface between the electrolyte and the Li anode. It is assumed that voids initiate and grow by the focussing of Li flux at the periphery of pre-existing small imperfections along the interface between the solid electrolyte and Li anode. Void growth in the Li anode, driven by stripping of the Li+ ions from the anode, is accompanied by creep within the anode. Consequently, the initiation and growth of these voids involve electrochemical stripping of Li+ from the anode, creep deformation of the anode and flux of Li+ through the adjacent solid electrolyte. Here we present a numerical analysis of this problem. We consider a single-ion conductor electrolyte, with Butler–Volmer kinetics governing the interfacial flux and the Li anode modelled as a power-law creeping solid. The study reveals that void growth can only initiate from relatively large pre-existing interfacial imperfections of size > 1200 μm along the interface of the solid electrolyte (LLZO) and the Li anode. In contrast, experimental observations suggest that voids as small as 1μm can initiate along the LLZO/Li interface and thus the simple picture described above involving power-law creep of the Li anode coupled with Butler–Volmer kinetics, even with interfacial diffusion accounted for, is insufficient to explain these observations. Our calculations reveal that the degree of flux focussing on the periphery of small imperfections must exceed that predicted by Butler–Volmer kinetics in order for interfacial voids to initiate and grow.",Extreme Mechanics Letters,10.1016/j.eml.2021.101307
Rapid preparation and performances of garnet electrolyte with sintering aids for solid-state Li–S battery,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries are attractive due to their high theoretical energy density. However, conventional Li–S batteries with liquid electrolytes undergo polysulfide shuttle-effect and lithium dendrite formation during charge/discharge process, leading to poor electrochemical performance and safety issues. Garnet type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid-state electrolyte (SSE) restricts the penetration of polysulfides and exhibits high ionic conductivity at room temperature (RT). Herein, Li6.5La3Zr1.5Nb0.5O12 (LLZNO) ceramic electrolyte using Li3PO4 (LPO) as sintering aids (LLZNO-LPO) is prepared by the rapid sintering method and is applied to construct a shuttle-effect free solid-state Li–S battery. The SSE displays high conductive pure cubic-LLZO phase; during the rapid sintering, LPO melts and junctions the voids between the grains, thus improves Li+ conductivity. As a result, the LLZNO-LPO ceramic electrolyte with Li+ conductivity of 4.3 × 10−4 S cm−1 and high critical current density (CCD) of 1.2 mA cm−2 is obtained at RT. The Li–S solid-state battery which utilizes LLZNO-LPO ceramic electrolyte can deliver an initial discharge capacity of 943 mA h·g−1 and 602 mA h·g−1 retention after 60 cycles. In the same time, the initial coulombic efficiency is as high as 99.5%, indicating that the SSE can effectively block the polysulfide shuttle towards the Li anode and fulfill a shuttle-free Li–S battery.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.03.138
Ameliorating the interfacial issues of all-solid-state lithium metal batteries by constructing polymer/inorganic composite electrolyte,"© 2020 Science PressLithium metal is one of the most promising anodes for next-generation batteries due to its high capacity and low reduction potential. However, the notorious Li dendrites can cause the short life span and safety issues, hindering the extensive application of lithium batteries. Herein, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramics are integrated into polyethylene oxide (PEO) to construct a facile polymer/inorganic composite solid-state electrolyte (CSSE) to inhibit the growth of Li dendrites and widen the electrochemical stability window. Given the feasibility of our strategy, the designed PEO-LLZO-LiTFSI composite solid-state electrolyte (PLL-CSSE) exhibits an outstanding cycling property of 134.2 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles and the Coulombic efficiency of 99.1% after 1000 cycles at 1 C in LiFePO4-Li cell. When cooperated with LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathode, the PLL-CSSE renders a capacity retention of 82.4% after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. More importantly, the uniform dispersion of LLZO in PEO matrix is tentative tested via Raman and FT-IR spectra and should be responsible for the improved electrochemical performance. The same conclusion can be drawn from the interface investigation after cycling. This work presents an intriguing solid-state electrolyte with high electrochemical performance, which will boost the development of all-solid-state lithium batteries with high energy density.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2020.09.033
Investigating the Calcination and Sintering of Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) Solid Electrolytes Using Operando Synchrotron X-ray Characterization and Mesoscale Modeling,"© The crystallographic structure and microstructure of solid electrolytes, such as Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), have a profound impact on their reactivity, conductivity, and stability toward dendrites in solid-state batteries. Controlling the material's structure and morphology requires fine control during the synthesis process, where multiple conditions (precursor particle size/distribution, calcination/sintering temperature, ramp rate, etc.) influence performance. This paper describes, for the first time, the operando characterization of the calcination process using synchrotron X-ray diffraction combined with a mesoscale model of grain growth during the calcination and densification of LLZO. The model is then used to guide synthesis conditions to enhance the densification process. The X-ray data reveal significant coarsening of the initial nanophase lanthanum zirconate precursors during conversion to LLZO. The mesoscale model shows that the activation energy for diffusion during calcination is lower than that during sintering, indicating the inherent coupling between the chemical reaction and grain growth processes. Simulations suggest that particles with small and bimodal size distribution experience better densification, as does precise grading (smaller particles near the surface and larger particles at the center) of different-sized particles. The approach described here can be adapted to understand and guide the synthesis of other materials that undergo calcination and sintering (e.g., transition metal oxide cathodes).",Chemistry of Materials,10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c04393
Improved Li6.5La3Zr1.5Nb0.5O12 electrolyte and effects of atmosphere exposure on conductivities,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Cubic Li6.5La3Zr1.5Nb0.5O12 ceramic electrolyte is prepared by a simple modified sol-gel process. Quite fine mother powders are obtained through pressing, crushing and grinding for several times instead of ball milling. The Li6.5La3Zr1.5Nb0.5O12 electrolyte achieves a high relative density of ~97% and excellent properties with a high ionic conductivity of 7.00 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a low electronic conductivity of 9.94 × 10−8 S cm−1 at room temperature. When exposed to the atmosphere, the ionic conductivity of Li6.5La3Zr1.5Nb0.5O12 gradually decreases to 2.25 × 10−4 S cm−1 after 22 days. EIS test provides a direct evidence to demonstrate an increase trend of grain boundary impedances. Rietveld refinement reveals the lattice parameters increase with the exposure time and obvious changes in lithium occupancies at 24d and 96h sites occur before and after the atmosphere exposure. A linear increase of Li2CO3 impurity with exposure days is also found. Moreover, the electronic conductivity of Li6.5La3Zr1.5Nb0.5O12 is reduced as well after atmosphere exposure (from 9.94 × 10−8 S cm−1 to 7.60 × 10−8 S cm−1). This work reports a simple, effective method for the preparation of high-quality LLZO ceramics and may be helpful to further concern on the atmosphere stability of them.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229845
"Lanthanide doping of Li7La3-xMxZr2O12 (M=Sm, Dy, Er, Yb; x=0.1–1.0) and dopant size effect on the electrochemical properties","© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Lithium-ion batteries, as one of the energy storage devices, has attracted much attention due to its remarkable characteristics. However, they pose safety challenges because of their liquid electrolytes. Solid electrolytes are one of the key candidates to tackle the safety issues in Li-ion batteries. As a solid electrolyte, garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 is a promising candidate with its high stability against lithium metal and wide electrochemical window among its counterparts. But, the ionic conductivity is yet to be compared with liquid electrolytes. Hence, doping is still the common strategy to adjust the ionic conductivities. Despite the fact that doping with various elements is well-documented, Lanthanide group element doping is not thoroughly investigated. This research is to study the synthesis of garnet-type Li7La3-xMxZr2O12 (M = Sm, Dy, Er, Yb; x = 0.0–1.0) novel compositions to enlighten the effect of lanthanide group element doping as a function of ionic radius. Results showed that increasing dopant ionic radius improves densification, diminishes Li-ion conduction and, except Yb case, expands the lattice. However, impurity phases formed when the solubility limit is reached, has overall a positive impact on Li-ion conduction. The highest ionic conductivity (0.15 mS/cm) and lowest activation energy (0.18 eV) without impurity phases were obtained from Yb doped LLZO. It was also found that the presence of LiDyO2 improves the ionic conductivity to 0.16 mS/cm.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.03.010
X-ray Nanoimaging of Crystal Defects in Single Grains of Solid-State Electrolyte Li7-3 xAlxLa3Zr2O12,"© All-solid-state lithium batteries promise significant improvements in energy density and safety over traditional liquid electrolyte batteries. The Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid-state electrolyte shows excellent potential given its high ionic conductivity and good thermal, chemical, and electrochemical stability. Nevertheless, further improvements on electrochemical and mechanical properties of LLZO call for an in-depth understanding of its local microstructure. Here, we employ Bragg coherent diffractive imaging to investigate the atomic displacements inside single grains of LLZO with various Al-doping concentrations, resulting in cubic, tetragonal, and cubic-tetragonal mixed structures. We observe coexisting domains of different crystallographic orientations in the tetragonal structure. We further show that Al doping leads to crystal defects such as dislocations and phase boundaries in the mixed- and cubic-phase grain. This study addresses the effect of Al doping on the nanoscale structure within individual grains of LLZO, which is informative for the future development of solid-state batteries.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c00315
Operando analysis of the molten Li|LLZO interface: Understanding how the physical properties of Li affect the critical current density,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Solid-state electrolytes are promising for enabling high-energy-density Li metal batteries. However, despite significant progress in recent years, shorting due to Li penetration of the solid electrolyte at high current densities hinders further adoption of solid-state batteries. In this study, we use operando optical and scanning electron microscopy to probe mechanisms behind Li penetration in molten Li|LLZO model systems. A step increase in critical current density (CCD) is observed across the melting point of Li, reaching a CCD of 530 mA/cm2 at 195°C for LLZO. Postmortem microscopy and analysis of the CCD across the melting point of Li are used to support theories explaining how LLZO fractures and Li penetration occurs. A mechanical model is developed describing the transition from the viscoplastic behavior of solid Li to the viscous behavior of molten Li and reveals the critical role of mechanical properties of Li metal in determining CCD.",Matter,10.1016/j.matt.2021.04.016

Published by Science Press. All rights reserved.The band structures, lattice parameters, densities of states and bond characteristics of two different Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte materials in tetragonal and cubic phases were calculated by the first-principles method based on density functional theory (DFT). The reason why the ionic conductivity of the tetrahedral phase is lower than that of cubic phase was explained by the electronic structural characteristics based on the theoretical calculation results. Two kinds of crystalline structure LLZO materials were designed based on first principles calculation of LLZO and prepared by the high temperature solid phase method, and the properties of LLZO pellets with different sintering time were analysed. The effect of the synthesis process parameters on the properties of Li7La3Zr2O12 was explored. Results show that the average lattice size of cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (C-LLZO) is a=b=c= 1.302 246 nm, while that of tetragonal Li7La3Zr2O12 (T-LLZO) is a=b=1.313 064 nm, c=1.266 024 nm. The C-LLZO sintered at 1000℃ for 12 h has a pure cubic phase and a maximum ionic conductivity of 9.8×10-5 S•cm-1 is realized at room temperature (25℃).

Absolute local quantification of li as function of state-of-charge in all-solid-state li batteries via 2d mev ion-beam analysis,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Direct observation of the lithiation and de-lithiation in lithium batteries on the component and microstructural scale is still difficult. This work presents recent advances in MeV ion-beam analysis, enabling quantitative contact-free analysis of the spatially-resolved lithium content and state-of-charge (SoC) in all-solid-state lithium batteries via 3 MeV proton-based characteristic x-ray and gamma-ray emission analysis. The analysis is demonstrated on cross-sections of ceramic and polymer all-solid-state cells with LLZO and MEEP/LIBOB solid electrolytes. Different SoC are measured ex-situ and one polymer-based operando cell is charged at 333 K during analysis. The data unambiguously show the migration of lithium upon charging. Quantitative lithium concentrations are obtained by taking the physical and material aspects of the mixed cathodes into account. This quantitative lithium determination as a function of SoC gives insight into irreversible degradation phenomena of all-solid-state batteries during the first cycles and locations of immobile lithium. The determined SoC matches the electrochemical characterization within uncertainties. The presented analysis method thus opens up a completely new access to the state-of-charge of battery cells not depending on electrochemical measurements. Automated beam scanning and data-analysis algorithms enable a 2D quantitative Li and SoC mapping on the µm-scale, not accessible with other methods.",Batteries,10.1149/1945-7111/ac0654
Improving the Interfacial Contact between Li7La3Zr2O12and Lithium Anode by Depositing a Film of Silver,"© 2021 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS""). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.Cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 is a promising solid-state electrolyte as its high Li+ conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and good stability with lithium anode. However, the interfacial impedance between Li7La3Zr2O12 and lithium anode is high, which hinders the electrochemical performance of batteries. In this work, magnetron sputtering has been adopted to deposit a film of silver on two surfaces of LLZO to improve the interfacial contact between Li7La3Zr2O12 and lithium anode. The XRD, SEM, EDS and XPS show that a film of sliver is successfully deposited on LLZO. The EIS indicates the interfacial impedance between Li7La3Zr2O12 and lithium anode decreases from 661 Ω•cm2 to 26 Ω•cm2 after modification. In lithium plating and striping test, the modified symmetrical lithium battery exhibits a small and stable voltage at a current density of 0.4 mA cm-2, while the unmodified one presents a high and unstable voltage even at 0.05 mA cm-2.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1007/s40192-021-00214-7
An Active Learning Approach for the Design of Doped LLZO Ceramic Garnets for Battery Applications,"© 2021, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.Growing demand in applications like portable electronics and electric vehicles calls for cost-effective, safe, and high-performance energy storage systems. Development of solid-state electrolytes with Li+ ionic conductivities comparable to those of the current liquid chemistries is an important step towards meeting these needs. Unfortunately, one of the most promising solid electrolytes known to date, lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO) garnets, exhibits far from ideal ionic conductivity. Thus, significant efforts, often through aliovalent substitution, have been devoted to increasing their ionic conductivity. Given the high-dimensional design space involved and the time required for synthesis, processing, and characterization of new materials, brute force approaches are not ideal to identify optimal compositions. We assess whether machine learning tools can be used to effectively explore the design space of LLZO garnets and potentially reduce the number of experiments involved in their development. We collected, curated, and filtered all the experimental results of Li+ ionic conductivity in LLZOs published in the scientific literature. Exploration of this data provides insights into the mechanisms that govern ionic transport in these oxides. Furthermore, we show that active learning with predictive models based on random forests can effectively be used with current data for the design of experiments. Our results indicate that the current highest Li+ ionic conductivity garnet LLZO could have been discovered with only 30% of the experimental studies conducted to date. All data and models are available online and can be used to drive future investigations.",Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229843
Co-contribution of quenching and nanocrystallization on ionic-conductivity improvement of a composite electrolyte of polyethylene Oxide/Li7La3Zr2O12 nanofibers at 45 °C for all-solid-state Li metal batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Solid electrolytes have been actively researched for rechargeable lithium batteries, but low ion conductivity (σ) and the growth of lithium dendrites hinder their practical applications. This study synthesizes a composite solid electrolyte combining polyethylene oxide (PEO) with Li7La3Zr2O12 nanofibers (LLZO NFs) and quenching in liquid nitrogen. The LLZO NFs efficiently increase the σ and mechanical strength of composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs), thereby promoting the uniform deposition of lithium metal and inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites. More importantly, the quenching markedly reduces the crystallinity of the electrolyte, which further enhances the ionic conductivity even at 30 °C. The CPEs exhibit high σ (1.09 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C) and enlarged electrochemical window (up to 5 V vs. Li/Li+). An integrated all-solid-state lithium metal battery (ASSLMBs) (labeled as LiFePO4|PEO/LLZO NFs/LiTFSI-q|Li) delivers high initial discharge capacity (138.8 mAh g−1) and excellent cycling stability (74.8% at 0.5C after 300 cycles) with remarkable capacity retention (84.0% at 1C after 200 cycles) at 45 °C.

Stoichiometric irreversibility of aged garnet electrolytes,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdSolid-state lithium batteries (SSLBs) have been regarded as one of the next-generation energy storage systems. With the adoption of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) and lithium metal anodes, SSLBs enable higher energy density and more reliable safety than the state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. Among potential SSEs, the cation-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is promising for its high ionic conductivity (~10−3 S cm−2) at room temperature and high stability with Li metal anode. However, the storage of doped LLZO in the ambient condition suffers the aging effect, including the structural transition (i.e. low-temperature cubic form) and the stoichiometric changes (i.e. Li2CO3). These changes are detrimental to LLZO ionic conductivity and interfacial stability in SSLBs. To this end, we are motivated to investigate the structural and stoichiometric reversibility of aged LLZO during thermal treatment. With the help of an in-situ synchrotron-based high-energy X-ray diffraction technique, our experiments revealed that the LLZO powders became a low-temperature cubic phase when exposed to the ambient condition for an extended period of time. A high temperature cubic form can be restored after a thermal treatment of the aged LLZO powder, regardless of the type of dopant. However, the restoration of the stoichiometry remained a challenge, and the degree of the restoration showed a clear dependence on the dopant chemistry.",Materials Today Energy,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00566

Effect of Stress State on Phase Stability and Ionic Transport in the Solid Electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.In recent years, Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO), a garnet-type solid oxide, has gained considerable attention as an alternative electrolyte material to conventional liquid electrolytes due to its high ionic conductivity (10-4 S cm-1) and stability with respect to metallic lithium. This study employs classical molecular dynamics simulations to probe the relationship between the applied stress state and lithium ion dynamics in single-crystal LLZO. It is found that the activation energy experiences a decrease under hydrostatic tension and an increase under hydrostatic compression. When the crystal is mechanically distorted under a uniaxial load in the x-direction, the material exhibits a cubic-to-tetragonal phase change; this change occurs at 1000 K tested under tension and at most temperatures tested under compression.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.034

Interfacial barrier free organic-inorganic hybrid electrolytes for solid state batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Organic-inorganic hybrid solid electrolytes (HSEs) are expected to overcome the inherent limitations of rigid fragile inorganic electrolytes for solid state batteries.

Grain boundary modification in garnet electrolyte to suppress lithium dendrite growth,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Solid-state batteries (SSBs) have attracted many attentions due to its higher energy density and improved safety. As one of the most promising solid electrolytes, garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has achieved significant advances in its cell performance, however, its application in Li-metal batteries is still hindered by lithium dendrite growth at voids or grain boundaries inside the solid electrolyte. Herein, a novel grain-boundary enhancement strategy was demonstrated by introducing Li6Zr2O7 (LZO), which can be decomposed into Li2O in situ, into Ta-doped LLZO (LLZT). The Li2O provides a sufficient inner Li2O atmosphere, achieving none mother powder sintering. The Li2ZrO3 stays at garnet grain boundaries or fills up the pores, which have been shown to effectively suppress the lithium dendrite growth. More importantly, the critical current density (CCD) of the Li | LLZT-LZO | Li symmetric cell achieved as high as 1.4 mA cm−2 at 25 °C and 2.0 mA cm−2 at 60 °C, and the long-term lithium cycling remained stable over 2000 h at 0.3 mA cm−2. Moreover, the Li-S battery maintained high discharge capacity of 816 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5C. Therefore, our work provides a facile and effective strategy to prepare a safety-enhanced electrolyte for future applications of SSBs.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1039/d1nr01079d
Constructing compatible interface between Li7La3Zr2O12solid electrolyte and LiCoO2cathode for stable cycling performances at 4.5 v,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.With high theoretical capacity and tap density, LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode has been extensively utilized in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for energy storage devices. However, the bottleneck of structural and interfacial instabilities upon cycling severely restricts its practical application at high cut-off voltage. From another perspective, the compatibility between the electrode and electrolyte is highly valued in the development of all-solid-state batteries. Herein, we construct a compatible interface between Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and LCO through a facile surface modification strategy, which significantly improves the cycling stability of LCO at a high cut-off voltage of 4.5 V. Characterization results demonstrate that the LCO@1.0 LLZO sample delivers a desirable capacity retention of 76.8% even after 1000 cycles at 3.0-4.5 V with the current density of 1 C (1 C = 274 mA g-1). Further investigation indicates that the LLZO modification layer could protect the LCO electrode through effectively alleviating the side reactions, which not only facilitates the Li+ transportation at the interface but also mitigates the bulk structure degradation. Moreover, it is also established that a small amount of La and Zr ions could gradiently migrate into the surface lattice of LCO to generate a thin layer of the surface solid solution Li-Co-La-Zr-O. Thus formed pinning region between surface modified LLZO and LCO cathode could contribute both to their mechanical compatibility and Li+ kinetics behavior upon repeated cycling.

Herein, a new type of lithium-ion conductor oxide Li19La36Ga7O74(LLGO) with a high bulk conductivity of 1.4 × 10−3S cm−1which is higher than that of Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO, 7 × 10−4S cm−1) is synthesized to solve the poor ionic conductivity problem. Based on density functional theory (DFT), LLGO has a two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2D-3D) co-conduction lithium ion migration path. Using LLGO as a conductor filler, the polyethylene oxide (PEO)/LiTFSI/LLGO (PLG) composite prepared by solution casting served as solid electrolyte to improve the interface compatibility between the solid electrolyte and electrode. The lithium ion migration number (t+) of the PLG electrolyte membrane is as high as 0.69. At a current density of 200 μA cm−2, the Li|PLG|Li battery can circulate stably for more than 4000 hours. Remarkably, in the LiFePO4|PLG|Li full battery, good compatibility of the PLG with the electrode can ensure the batteries not only a reversible capacity of 80 mA h g−1at 25 °C, but also stable cycling of more than 110 days at a rate of 0.5C at 60 °C. Therefore, the addition of LLGO has greatly improved the electrochemical performance of solid-state batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1021/acsenergylett.0c02559
Design of High-Voltage Stable Hybrid Electrolyte with an Ultrahigh Li Transference Number,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Considering the high energy consumption during processing, and the low compliance and adhesion of ceramic electrolytes, the integration of polymer into ceramic electrolytes provides a way to mitigate the interfacial issues. However, the severe ion concentration gradient, low ionic conductivity, and instability toward Li metal and high-voltage cathodes become the major concerns in applying hybrid electrolytes. In this work, we report a single-ion-conducting hybrid electrolyte (SIE-LLZO) with 64 wt % Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) particles embedded in a fluoroboron-centered Li-conductive polymer framework (LiBFSIE). The SIE-LLZO electrolyte exhibited a high Li transference number of 0.94 and electrochemical stability up to 5.6 V vs Li/Li+. Promising averaged Coulombic efficiencies of 99.97% and 99.91% were achieved in cells with LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 cathodes for 400 and 200 cycles, respectively. The Li-conducting pathway in the hybrid electrolyte was further investigated by a 6Li-to-7Li isotope replacement method, indicating that Li transport mainly relies on the LLZO and interface between LiBFSIE and LLZO.",ACS Energy Letters,10.3390/ma14081998
All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries with oxide/sulfide composite electrolytes,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Li6.3La3Zr1.65W0.35O12 (LLZO)-Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) composite electrolytes and all-solid-state cells containing LLZO-LPSC were fabricated by cold pressing at room temperature. The LPSC:LLZO ratio was varied, and the microstructure, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical performance of the corresponding composite electrolytes were investigated; the ionic conductivity of the composite electrolytes was three or four orders of magnitude higher than that of LLZO. The high conductivity of the composite electrolytes was attributed to the enhanced relative density and the rule of mixture for soft LPSC particles with high lithium-ion conductivity (~10−4 S·cm−1 ). The specific capacities of all-solid-state cells (ASSCs) consisting of a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode and the composite electrolytes of LLZO:LPSC = 7:3 and 6:4 were 163 and 167 mAh·g−1, respectively, at 0.1 C and room temperature. Moreover, the charge–discharge curves of the ASSCs with the composite electrolytes revealed that a good interfacial contact was successfully formed between the NCM811 cathode and the LLZO-LPSC composite electrolyte.",Materials,10.3390/ma14071671
"Effect of sintering process on ionic conductivity of li7-x la3 zr2-x nbx o12 (X = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) solid electrolytes","© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Garnet-type Li7 La3 Zr2 O12 (LLZO) is considered as a promising solid electrolyte. Nb-doped LLZO ceramics exhibit significantly improved ion conductivity. However, how to prepare the Nbdoped LLZO ceramics in a simple and economical way, meanwhile to investigate the relationship between process conditions and properties in Li7-x La3 Zr2-x Nbx O12 ceramics, is particularly important. In this study, Li7-x La3 Zr2-x Nbx O12 (LLZNx O, x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) ceramics were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction. The effect of sintering process on the structure, microstructure, and ionic conductivity of LLZNx O (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) ceramics was investigated. Due to the more contractive Nb-O bonds in LLZNx O ceramics, the cubic structures are much easier to form and stabilize, which could induce the decreased preparation time. High-performance garnet LLZNx O ceramics can be obtained by optimizing the sintering process with lower calcining temperature and shorter holding time. The garnet samples with x = 0.4 calcined at 850◦ C for 10 h and sintered at 1250◦ C for 4 h exhibit the highest ionic conductivity of 3.86 × 10−4 S·cm−1 at room temperature and an activation energy of 0.32 eV, which can be correlated to the highest relative density of 96.1%, and good crystallinity of the grains.",Materials,10.1002/aenm.202003811
Modulating Nanoinhomogeneity at Electrode–Solid Electrolyte Interfaces for Dendrite-Proof Solid-State Batteries and Long-Life Memristors,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHDendrite penetration in ceramic lithium conductors severely constrains the development of solid-state batteries (SSBs) while its nanoscale origin remains unelucidated. An in situ nanoscopic electrochemical characterization technique is developed based on conductive-atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) to reveal the local dendrite growth kinetics. Using Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) as a model system, significant local inhomogeneity is observed with a hundredfold decrease in the dendrite triggering bias at grain boundaries compared with that at grain interiors. The origin of the local weakening is assigned to the nanoscale variation of elastic modulus and lithium flux detouring. An ionic-conductive polymeric homogenizing layer is designed which achieves a high critical current density of 1.8 mA cm–2 and a low interfacial resistance of 14 Ω cm2. Practical SSBs based on LiFePO4 cathodes can be stably cycled over 300 times. Beyond this, highly reversible electrochemical dendrite healing in LLZO is discovered using the c-AFM electrode, based on which a model memristor with a high on/off ratio of ≈105 is demonstrated for >200 cycles. This work not only provides a novel tool to investigate and design interfaces in SSBs but also offers opportunities for solid electrolytes beyond energy applications.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1007/s11426-020-9936-6
Integrated interface between composite electrolyte and cathode with low resistance enables ultra-long cycle-lifetime in solid-state lithium-metal batteries,"© 2021, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.We report a three-dimensional (3D) nanofiber-reinforced solid composite electrolyte with a 3D Li+-conducting ceramic network of Li6.25Ga0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) nanofibers. Benefiting from the 3D structure, the composite shows a high ionic conductivity of 3.2×10−4 S cm−1 and Li-ion transference number of 0.32 at room temperature. The interfacial resistance between the composite solid electrolyte and cathode is mitigated by creating an integrated interfacial structure, in which the polyethylene oxide (PEO)-lithiumbis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) binder and ionic liquids (ILs) form a viscoelastic interface. Therefore, intimate contact, low interfacial impedance, and fast ion-transport between the cathode and the solid electrolyte are simultaneously achieved. Solid-state lithium metal batteries with the LiFePO4 cathode deliver a superior capacity (158.0 mA h g−1) and significant capacity retention (90.4% retention after 800 cycles) at 60 °C. Moreover, the smooth and uniform Li surface after long-term cycling confirms the successful suppression of the dendrite formation. The integrated interfacial structure provides a solution to the interfacial problem and improves the cycling performance in solid-state Li-metal batteries.

Unraveling the Li Penetration Mechanism in Polycrystalline Solid Electrolytes,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHLithium dendrite penetration has been widely evidenced in ceramic solid electrolytes (SEs), which are expected to suppress Li dendrite formation due to their ultrahigh elastic modulus. This work aims to reveal the mechanism of Li penetration in polycrystalline SEs through electro-chemo-mechanical phase-field model, using Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) as the model material. The results show the Li penetration patterns are influenced by both mechanical and electronic properties of the microstructures, i.e., grain boundaries (GBs). Li nucleates at the GB junctions on the Li/SE interface and propagates along the GB, at which the interfacial compressive stress is small due to the GB softening. Moreover, the excess trapped electrons at the GB may trigger isolated Li nucleation sites, abruptly increasing the Li penetration depth. High-throughput simulations yield a phase map of Li penetration patterns under different trapped electrons concentrations and GB/grain elastic modulus mismatch. The map can quantitatively inform whether the mechanical or electronic properties dominate Li penetration morphologies, providing a strategy for the design of improved SE materials.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1007/s11581-021-03928-y
Interfacial modification enabled room temperature solid-state lithium–metal batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.Lithium solid-state batteries (SSBs) with tantalum doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZT) inorganic ceramic electrolytes have been attracting much interest for its extraordinary lithium ionic conductivity, non-flammability, and wide electrochemical window. However, poor solid–solid contact between the electrodes and electrolyte results in large interfacial resistance, which hinders its normal operation and practical application. Herein, triethylene glycol diacetate-2-propenoic acid butyl ester (TEGDA-BA) based gel polymer electrolytes (GPE) were fabricated and coated on both sides of spark plasma sintering (SPS)–derived LLZT pellet. GPE introduction not only provides intimate contact between solid electrolyte and electrodes but also avoids side reactions such as reduction of LLZT by lithium anode. Moreover, symmetric Li cell markedly reduced interfacial resistance and exhibited a critical current density up to 1.0 mA cm−2 at room temperature (25 °C), and it can also stably cycle at 0.5 mA cm−2 for over 277 h without Li dendrite formation. The assembled solid-state LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523)/GPE–LLZT–GPE/Li battery exhibits high initial capacity (163.5 mAh g−1) at 0.2 C. This work provides a facile method to reduce the interfacial resistance and demonstrates durable high-energy solid-state lithium metal batteries suitable for practical application.",Ionics,10.1021/acsami.0c23144
Impact of Protonation on the Electrochemical Performance of Li7La3Zr2O12Garnets,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Li7La3Zr 2O12 (LLZO) garnet ceramics are promising electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries with high energy density. However, these electrolytes are prone to Li+/H+ exchange, that is, protonation, resulting in degradation of their Li-ion conductivity. Here, we identify how common processing steps, such as surface cleaning in alcohol or acetone, trigger LLZO partial protonation. We deconvolute the contributions to the electrochemical impedance spectra of both the protonated LLZO phase (HLLZO) and its decomposition products forming upon annealing. While the mixed conduction of H+/Li+ ions in HLLZO decreases the contribution of the electrolyte to the overall impedance, it deteriorates the transport of Li+ ions across the LLZO/Li interface. This is also the case after thermal decomposition of HLLZO, which occurs at significantly lower temperature than that for pristine LLZO. As a result, symmetric Li/LLZO/Li cells suffer from inhomogeneous lithium electrodeposition within the first three cycles when stripping and plating a capacity of 1 mA·h/cm2 per half-cycle at 0.1 mA/cm2. We demonstrate that LLZO protonation is avoided when applying solvents with very low acidity, such as hexane. Such Li/LLZO/Li cells provide stable cycling over more than 300 h, demonstrating the importance of selecting an appropriate solvent for LLZO processing to prevent dendrites formation.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229430
Journal of Power Sources Modelling electro-chemical induced stresses in all-solid-state batteries: Anisotropy effects in cathodes and cell design optimisation,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.All-solid-state lithium batteries offer promising advantages in energy density and safety compared to conventional lithium ion batteries. However, the majority of this type of batteries suffers from a low cycling stability, which might originate from mechanical fatigue caused by mechanical stresses and strains in the rigid structure. We introduce a general approach to model and analyse the stresses in rigid cathode/electrolyte electrodes on a cell level, which enables to develop optimised cell designs with an improved mechanical stability. We apply this approach on composite cathodes with a Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramic electrolyte and LiCoO2 (LCO) active material. Using the 3D microstructure of a real cathode, the stresses inside a free-standing electrode and model cells with a thin and a thick LLZO separator are calculated for the charging cycle considering isotropic and anisotropic material properties of LCO as well as non-textured and textured crystallographic alignment. Compared to randomly oriented crystals, the textured crystallographic alignment of LCO grains, introduced by the manufacturing process, has a significant effect and yields considerably better stress distributions in all cell configurations investigated. The design of optimised all-solid-state cells with reduced separator thickness leads to a significantly more favourable stress state than a typical lab scale separator-supported cell.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1021/acsaem.0c03098
Garnet-Poly(ϵ-caprolactone- co-trimethylene carbonate) Polymer-in-Ceramic Composite Electrolyte for All-Solid-State Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© A composite electrolyte based on a garnet electrolyte (LLZO) and polyester-based co-polymer (80:20 ϵ-caprolactone (CL)-trimethylene carbonate, PCL-PTMC with LiTFSI salt) is prepared. Integrating the merits of both ceramic and co-polymer electrolytes is expected to address the poor ionic conductivity and high interfacial resistance in solid-state lithium-ion batteries. The composite electrolyte with 80 wt % LLZO and 20 wt % polymer (PCL-PTMC and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at 72:28 wt %) exhibited a Li-ion conductivity of 1.31 × 10-4 S/cm and a transference number (tLi+) of 0.84 at 60 °C, notably higher than those of the pristine PCL-PTMC electrolyte. The prepared composite electrolyte also exhibited an electrochemical stability of up to 5.4 V vs Li+/Li. The interface between the composite electrolyte and a LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode was also improved by direct incorporation of the polymer electrolyte as a binder in the cathode coating. A Li/composite electrolyte/LFP solid-state cell provided a discharge capacity of ca. 140 mAh/g and suitable cycling stability at 55 °C after 40 cycles. This study clearly suggests that this type of amorphous polyester-based polymers can be applied in polymer-in-ceramic composite electrolytes for the realization of advanced all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c02439
Improved Electromechanical Stability of the Li Metal/Garnet Ceramic Interface by a Solvent-Free Deposited OIPC Soft Layer,"© Ceramic electrolyte-based solid-state batteries suffer from instability at the Li metal-ceramic interface, resulting in poor and irregular lithium electrodeposition and high interfacial resistance. Here, we report the deposition, by spin coating, of an organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) soft layer on the surfaces of Li metal and a ceramic garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) electrolyte. This soft interfacial layer facilitates enhancement of Li-ion transport between Li metal and the ceramic electrolyte, increasing slightly the total conductivity of the composite OIPC-LLZO solid electrolyte (up to 1.1 × 10-3 S·cm-1) and reducing the area-specific resistance (ASR) (by up to five times, e.g., from 640 to 120 ω·cm2). Such an achievement is crucial for the integration of solid inorganic electrolytes in all-solid-state batteries as well as the development of stable and efficient devices. The deposition of the OIPC thin layer (500 nm) was carried out by solvent-free spin coating, thus preventing any potential issues resulting from metallic lithium reacting with organic solvents. At room temperature, a solid and homogeneous soft layer was deposited between the Li metal anode and the LLZO ceramic electrolyte. The interfacial resistance was studied via SEM and EIS, and the evolution of Li transport between the two materials was followed by employing Li-ion stripping-plating experiments. Finally, this interfacial soft layer was integrated in a full cell (consisting of Li/OIPC/LLZO/OIPC/LFP) and demonstrated improved galvanostatic cycling performances due to the lower ASR.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229437
The initiation of void growth during stripping of Li electrodes in solid electrolyte cells,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.We analyse the initiation of void growth in the Li electrode during the stripping phase of an Li-ion cell with a solid (ceramic) electrolyte. We first show that standard Butler-Volmer kinetics fails to predict the observed void formation. This motivated us to recognise that void initiation/growth involves power-law creep of the Li electrode that is linked to the motion of dislocations. We show, via thermodynamic considerations, that dislocations significantly affect the interface kinetics and use variational principles to develop a modified form of Butler-Volmer kinetics for the interface flux that is associated with a deforming Li electrode. Numerical solutions are presented for the coupled flux of Li+ in a single-ion conductor solid electrolyte and the associated creep deformation of the Li electrode for an imposed stripping current. This involves solution of a Laplace equation for flux in the electrolyte and the nonlinear Stokes flow equations for a power-law creeping solid in the electrode. These two domains are coupled together via the modified Butler-Volmer relation. The calculations predict that an increasing stack pressure needs to be exerted with increasing cell current to avoid the initiation of void growth and are in excellent quantitative agreement with measurements for an Li/LLZO/Li cell.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1039/d0ta08179e
Interrelated interfacial issues between a Li7La3Zr2O12-based garnet electrolyte and Li anode in the solid-state lithium battery: a review,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.The Li7La3Zr2O12-based garnet (LLZO-BG) electrolyte has the advantage of strong thermal stability and can, therefore, avoid the flammability problem of organic electrolyte solutions. However, the solid-state lithium battery with LLZO-BG electrolyte has a much larger electrochemical resistance and poorer performance than the battery with an organic electrolyte solution, which is mainly related to the electrolyte/electrode interface. From the perspective of the LLZO-BG/Li interface, this review explores several interrelated interfacial issues, including the air instability of LLZO-BG, poor LLZO-BG/Li interfacial contact, easily generated lithium dendrite and the instability of LLZO-BG with the Li anode. We elaborate on the forming mechanisms, affecting factors and measures for improving these issues, and prospects for the future research directions of the LLZO-BG/Li interface.

Achieving high critical current density in Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12/MgO composite electrolytes,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Li-garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a promising solid electrolyte for lithium metal batteries owing to its excellent stability and high ionic conductivity. However, there exists serious lithium dendrite problem in LLZO electrolyte under elevated current density, easily leading to internal short-circuit and poor cycling performance. In this work, we demonstrated that Ta-doped LLZO with 4 wt% MgO additive delivered superior endurance to lithium dendrite due to its improved mechanical properties and lower electronic conductivity. The critical current density (CCD) of LLZTO-MgO composite electrolyte reached as high as 1.95 mA⸳cm−2 at room temperature (RT). It also realized stable lithium plating/stripping performance for 1000h under 0.5 mA⸳cm−2. Moreover, the full cell paired with LiNi0·6Co0·2Mn0·2O2 cathode exhibited better cycling stability especially at a high rate.

Modeling the electrical double layer at solid-state electrochemical interfaces,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.Models of the electrical double layer (EDL) at electrode/liquid-electrolyte interfaces no longer hold for all-solid-state electrochemistry. Here we show a more general model for the EDL at a solid-state electrochemical interface based on the Poisson–Fermi–Dirac equation. By combining this model with density functional theory predictions, the interconnected electronic and ionic degrees of freedom in all-solid-state batteries, including the electronic band bending and defect concentration variation in the space-charge layer, are captured self-consistently. Along with a general mathematical solution, the EDL structure is presented in various materials that are thermodynamically stable in contact with a lithium metal anode: the solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and the solid interlayer materials LiF, Li2O and Li2CO3.

All rights reserved.An all-solid-state Lithium button cell with Ga-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Ga-LLZO) as solid electrolyte, LiFePO4-based as cathode, and Li metal as anode has been successfully fabricated and characterized. The solid electrolyte was first optimized to obtain a high total conductivity. Different compositions of Li7-3xGaxLa3Zr2O12, where x =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) were synthesized using solid-state reaction and were characterized for its structural, morphological, electrical conductivity properties. XRD patterns of all sintered samples showed that all of the major peaks can be indexed to a cubic-phased garnet LLZO. SEM images revealed a densified sintered samples with relative densities of about 90% for all samples. Among the different studied compositions, the Ga-doped LLZO with x = 0.1 achieved the highest total conductivity of about 2.03 x 10-4 Scm-1 at 25oC, with an activation energy of 0.31 eV.

In this work, the combustion sol–gel technique is used to prepare an Al-doped LLZO solid electrolyte. The crystal structure is investigated, and the cubic phase is confirmed. Densification properties were investigated using SEM and optical dilatometry. The densification of the Al-doped sample takes place in two stages through two different shrinkage rates. Using 0.25 mol Al-dopant 94% relative density is achieved at 1100 °C. The effect of Al-doping on electrochemical properties is investigated in detail using AC impedance spectroscopy. The result indicates that the optimum concentration of the Al dopant in this study is 0.25 mol and, exhibits a high bulk conductivity of 5.89 × 10–4 S cm−1 at 25 °C. Also, the grain boundary conductivity for the 0.25 mol Al-doped LLZO sintered at 1100 °C is improved by half an order of magnitude comparing to Al free sample.

Improved ionic conductivity and Li dendrite suppression of PVDF-based solid electrolyte membrane by LLZO incorporation and mechanical reinforcement,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.High room-temperature ionic conductivity and mechanical property are essential for the application of solid electrolyte. In this work, a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based composite polymer solid electrolyte membrane (CSE) incorporated with Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) fillers and high-strength porous skeleton was prepared. The introduction of LLZO increased the ionic conductivity of PVDF at room temperature by reducing the crystallinity of PVDF matrix, and the addition of skeleton greatly improved the mechanical property of electrolyte membrane and inhibited the growth of lithium dendrites. The prepared PVDF-LLZO CSE has a room-temperature ionic conductivity of 1.75 × 10−4 S/cm, and the tensile strength reaches 95 MPa, which greatly enhanced the ability of lithium dendrite suppression.

Kinetics of lithium dendrite growth in garnet-type solid electrolyte,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Stiff Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is promising in preventing lithium dendrite and reviving lithium metal anode. Practically, lithium dendrites are still observed in LLZO-based cells. Therefore, investigation on dendrite growth feasibility and its kinetics in LLZO is important and critical. However, it is still short of deep insight and very difficult to get direct in situ evidence about dendrite growth kinetics theoretically and experimentally. Herein, we investigate the lithium dendrite growth kinetics as well as evaluate those important parameters such as LLZO thickness and dwell time to short circuit. Our results show that lithium dendrite exhibits a steady growth in LLZO, and the growth rate is proportional to the applied current density in a specific range of current density. The finding shed light on fundamental understanding of kinetics of lithium dendrite growth in LLZO, and the strategies can be easily expanded to other kind of solid electrolytes.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1039/d0ta11096e
Controlling the lithium proton exchange of LLZO to enable reproducible processing and performance optimization,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Ceramic solid state-electrolytes attract significant attention due to their intrinsic safety and, in the case of the garnet type Li6.45Al0.05La3Zr1.6Ta0.4O12(LLZO), the possibility to use Li-metal anodes to provide high energy densities on a cell and battery level. However, one of the major obstacles hindering their wide-spread application is the translation and optimization of production processes from laboratory to industrial scale. Even though the plausibility of manufacturing components and cellsviawet processing routes like tape casting and screen printing has been shown, the impact of the sensitivity of LLZO to air and protic solvents due to Li+/H+-exchange is not fully understood yet. An uncontrolled alteration of the powder surface results in poorly reproducible processing characteristics and electrochemical performance of the final battery components and full cells. This knowledge gap is the cause of the large performance variations reported across different research labs worldwide and is unacceptable for up-scaling to industrial level. To close this gap, the influence of the Li+/H+-exchange taking place at various steps in the manufacturing process was systematically investigated in this study. For the first time, this allowed a mechanistic understanding of its impact on the processability itself and on the resulting electrochemical performance of a free-standing LLZO separator. The importance of a close control of the pre-treatment and storage conditions of LLZO, as well as contact time with the solvent could be extracted for each step of the manufacturing process. As a result, we were able to optimize the processing of thin, dense, free standing LLZO separators and significantly improve the total Li-ion conductivity to 3.90 × 10−4S cm−1and the critical current density to over 300 μA cm−2without making structural changes to separator or the starting material. These findings do not only enable a deeper understanding and control over the manufacturing process, but also show potential for further improvement of cell concepts already existing in literature.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229363
Air-stable dopamine-treated garnet ceramic particles for high-performance composite electrolytes,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid-state electrolytes have shown the promise in the fabrication of solid lithium batteries with high energy density and safety. However, they are unstable against the air exposure and Li2CO3 forms on the surfaces, which is detrimental to the ionic conduction and the electrochemical stability of LLZO. Herein, the Li2CO3 layers on the LLZO surfaces are transformed into the air-stable shell via the chemical treatment of dopamine at room temperature, which enables the lipophilic property of LLZO fillers. The dopamine-based shells on LLZO particles can resist the air attack for up to 20 days. The improved ionic conductivity, electrochemical, and cycling stability are achieved for composite electrolytes with the above Li2CO3-free LLZO particles. These results present a facile solution for the functionalization of LLZO ceramic fillers with high performances and pave the way for the scalable production of LLZO-based solid lithium batteries.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1107/S2052520620016145

LLZTO retains its cubic symmetry (space group Ia 3 d) over the complete temperature range. When compared to other sites, the octahedral sites behave as the most rigid unit and show the smallest increase in atomic displacement parameters and bond length. The La and Li sites show similar thermal expansion in their bond lengths with temperature, and the anisotropic and equivalent atomic displacement parameters exhibit a distinctly larger increase at temperatures above 400 K. Detailed inspection of nuclear densities at the Li1 site reveal a small but significant displacement from the 24d position to the typical 96h position, which cannot, however, be resolved from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. The site occupation of LiI ions on Li1 and Li2 sites remains constant, so there is no change in site occupation with temperature.","Acta Crystallographica Section B: Structural Science, Crystal Engineering and Materials",10.1016/j.ssi.2020.115546
The effects of local strain on the cubic Li7La3Zr2O12(001)/Li(001) interface: A first-principles study,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO) is considered as one of the promising electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries, owing to its high Li ionic conductivity and chemical stability against Li anode. The c-LLZO/Li interface, as a Li-ion transport structure which affects the charge-discharge cycle of Li metal batteries, remains to be fully understood at present, especially on the atomic-level. Here, we present a first-principles study to explore the stability of the c-LLZO/Li interface and Li transport across the c-LLZO/Li interface. The interaction between Li slab and c-LLZO slab is attractive, which is confirmed to be physical adsorption by the density of state. Some vacancies are introduced into the Li layer to release the local strain at the interface. There is negligible change in the interface energy with the introduction of vacancies, meaning the local strain has little effect on the stability of the interface. The diffusion energy barriers of Li across the c-LLZO/Li interface are in the range of 0.17 to 0.36 eV, which are greatly influenced by the local strain. Such low diffusion energy barriers indicate the c-LLZO/Li interface is in favor of fast lithium ion conduction.",Solid State Ionics,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229252
"Exploring the relationship between solvent-assisted ball milling, particle size, and sintering temperature in garnet-type solid electrolytes","© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Garnet-type solid electrolytes, such as Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO), are promising materials for solid-state batteries, but processing remains a challenge, in part due to the high sintering temperature required for densification. This temperature can be lowered by decreasing the initial particle size via solvent-assisted ball milling, but the relationship between solvent choice, particle properties, sintering behavior, and ionic conductivity is not well understood. In this work, we systematically explore these parameters, showing that milling in commonly used protic solvents, such as alcohols, effectively decreases the particle size but results in lithium loss (through Li+/H+ exchange) that leads to poor sintering. By contrast, milling in aprotic solvents with surfactant reduces the particle size to ~220 nm without lithium loss, enabling the fabrication of dense samples (5.1 g/cm3) with good ionic conductivity (0.43 mS/cm at 25 °C) at a lower sintering temperature (1000 °C). We compare ionic conductivities and activation energies for samples prepared with different particle sizes and sintering temperatures and use multiphase-field simulations to identify the mass transport and microstructural mechanisms responsible for the observed sintering dependence on particle size. These results further clarify the relationship between processing parameters and performance and represent important progress toward overcoming fabrication challenges for these materials.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1021/acsami.0c17422
Electrochemical Characteristics of a Polymer/Garnet Trilayer Composite Electrolyte for Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Although solid-state Li-metal batteries (LMBs) featuring polymer-based solid electrolytes might one day replace conventional Li-ion batteries, the poor Li-ion conductivity of solid polymer electrolytes at low temperatures has hindered their practical applications. Herein, we describe the first example of using a co-precipitation method in a Taylor flow reactor to produce the metal hydroxides of both the Ga/F dual-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Ga/F-LLZO) ceramic electrolyte precursors and the Li2MoO4-modified Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (LMO@T-LNCM 811) cathode materials for LMBs. The Li/Nafion (LiNf)-coated Ga/F-LLZO (LiNf@Ga/F-LLZO) ceramic filler was finely dispersed in the poly(vinylidene fluoride)/polyacrylonitrile/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide)/succinonitrile matrix to give a trilayer composite polymer electrolyte (denoted ""Tri-CPE"") through a simple solution-casting. The bulk ionic conductivity of the Tri-CPE at room temperature was approximately 4.50 × 10-4 S cm-1 and exhibited a high Li+ ion transference number (0.84). It also exhibits a broader electrochemical window of 1-5.04 V versus Li/Li+. A full cell based on a CR2032 coin cell containing the LMO@T-LNCM811-based composite cathode, when cycled under 1 C/1 C at room temperature for 300 cycles, achieved an average Columbic efficiency of 99.4% and a capacity retention of 89.8%. This novel fabrication strategy for Tri-CPE structures has potential applications in the preparation of highly safe high-voltage cathodes for solid-state LMBs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.047
Synthesis of Ga-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte with high Li+ ion conductivity,"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) Li+ ion solid electrolyte is a promising candidate for next generation high-safety solid-state batteries. Ga-doped LLZO exhibits excellent Li+ ion conductivity, higher than 1 × 10−3 S cm−1. In this research, the doping amount of Ga, the calcination temperature of Ga-LLZO primary powders, the sintering conditions and the evolution of grains are explored to demonstrate the optimum parameters to obtain a highly conductive ceramics reproducibly via conventional solid-state reaction methods under ambient air sintering atmosphere. Cubic LLZO phase is obtained for Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12 powder calcined at low temperature 850 °C. In addition, ceramic pellets sintered at 1100 °C for 320 min using this powder have relative densities higher than 94% and conductivities higher than 1.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C.",Ceramics International,10.1021/acsami.0c16016
Wet-Environment-Induced Structural Alterations in Single- And Polycrystalline LLZTO Solid Electrolytes Studied by Diffraction Techniques,"© Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is one of the potential candidates for Li metal-based solid-state batteries owing to its high Li+ conductivity (≈10-3 S cm-1) at room temperature and large electrochemical stability window. However, LLZO undergoes protonation under the influence of moisture-forming Li2CO3 layers, thereby affecting its structural and transport properties. Therefore, a detailed understanding on the impact of the exchange of H+ on Li+ sites on structural alteration and kinetics under the influence of wet environments is of great importance. The present study focuses on the Li+/H+ exchange in single-crystal and polycrystal Li6La3ZrTaO12 (LLZTO) garnets prepared using the Czochralski method and solid-state reactions subjected to weathering in air, aqueous solutions at room temperature, and in aqueous solution at 363 K using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and neutron diffraction (ND) techniques. Based on 36 single-crystal diffraction and 88 powder diffraction measurements, we found that LLZTO crystallizes with space group (SG) Ia3¯ d with Li located in 96h (Li(2)) and 24d (Li(1)) sites, whereas the latter one is displaced toward the general position 96h forming shorter Li(1)-Li(2) jump distances. The degradation in air, wet air, water, and acetic acid leads to a Li+/H+ exchange that preferably takes place at the 24d site, which is in contrast to previous reports. Higher Li+/H+ was observed for LLZTO aged in water at 363 K that reduced the symmetry to SG I4¯ 3d from SG Ia3¯ d. This symmetry reduction was found to be related to the site occupation behavior of Li at the tetrahedral 12a site in SG I4¯ 3d. Moreover, Li+ is exchanged by H+ preferably at the 48e site (equivalent to 96h site). We also found that the equilibrium H+ concentrations in all media tested remains very similar, which is related to the H+ diffusion in the LLZTO-controlled exchange process. Only the increase in temperature led to a significant increase in the exchange capacity as well as in the Li+/H+ exchange rate. Overall, we found that the exchange rate, exchange capacity, site occupation behavior of Li+ and H+, as well as the structural stability of LLZTO, strongly depend on the composition. These findings suggest that measurements on a single LLZTO variant sample do not lead to a general conclusion for all garnets to guide the field toward better materials. In contrast, each composition has to be analyzed exclusively to understand the interplay of composition, structure, and exchange kinetic properties.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137348
Flexible hybrid solid electrolyte incorporating ligament-shaped Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 filler for all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries,"© 2020In this study we used a solution-casting method to fabricate a hybrid solid electrolyte (HSE) membrane based on a poly(vinylidene fluoride–co–hexafluoropropylene)/polyacrylonitrile (PVDF-HFP/PAN) polymer blend loaded with an interconnected ligament–shaped Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (Al-doped LLZO) filler and applied it in all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries (ASSLMBs). The as-prepared HSE containing the optimized quantity of Al-doped LLZO@PVDF-HFP/PAN/LiClO4/succinonitrile filler displayed high ionic conductivity (1.12 × 10–4 S m–1 at 25 °C), a wide electrochemical stability window [up to 4.2 V (Li/Li+)], and a high transference number (0.42). A full cell based on the composite cathode NCM811 (LNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, c-NCM811)/HSE/Li had a highest discharge specific capacity of 160.92 mA h g–1 at 0.1 C and a capacity retention of 92.52% after 100 cycles; at 0.2 C, these values were 144.70 mA h g–1 and 85.72% (after 100 cycles), respectively. The Li+ diffusion coefficient of the c-NCM811/HSE/Li cell was one order of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding cell having a bare cathode (b-NCM811/HSE/Li) as well as c-NCM811/SPE+10%SN/Li. We used a multiple-mode calorimetry device to investigate the in situ heat flow profiles of c-NCM811/HSE/Li, c-NCM811/SPE/Li, and b-NCM811/HSE/Li cells; the c-NCM811/HSE/Li cell exhibited the lowest heat profile. Thus, ASSLMBs featuring the NCM811 composite cathode and this as-prepared HSE have great potential for use in applications requiring batteries of high energy density.",Electrochimica Acta,10.3740/MRSK.2021.31.11.614

Currently, commercial LIBs are fabricated with liquid electrolytes, which have some safety issues such as low chemical stability, which can cause ignition of fire. As a substitute for liquid electrolytes, solid electrolytes are now being extensively studied. However, solid electrolytes have disadvantages of low ionic conductivity and high resistance at interface between electrode and electrolyte.

All rights reserved.Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO), lithium lanthanum zirconate is a promising garnet-type solid electrolyte that is being intensively studied for solid-state lithium batteries. The properties of LLZO such as compatibility with the lithium electrode, stability, and ionic conductivity make them to be used in all solid-state batteries. Moreover, lithium ion concentration and distribution, doping different cations, chemical composition, and interaction between different dopants have remarkable effects on the ionic conduction of LLZO material.

Crystal structure, morphology, ionic conduction, and local electronic structure were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) techniques, respectively.

In this work, the Nb-doped LLZO (Li6.5La3Zr1.5Nb0.5O12, Nb-LLZO) ceramic electrolyte is synthesized, and its mechanical properties are explored. An extremely small bending force can break Nb-LLZO ceramic sheets. Moreover, the improved composite membrane composed of as-prepared Nb-LLZO particles, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) matrix is prepared through a modified tape-casting method.

Failure Analysis of Garnet-Type Solid State Electrolyte LLZO by Electrochemical Method,"© 2021, Beijing Oriental Sun Cult. Comm. CO Ltd.Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is one of the most attractive candidates for achieving solid state lithium batteries. LLZO pellet is preferred due to its potential to prevent dendritic lithium growth and penetration. However, lithium dendrite can penetrate the LLZO pellets in a low current density, resulting in short circuit of the cell. In this work, we study the failure behavior of LLZO electrolyte through electrochemical method. Meanwhile, we also study the growth of lithium inside the LLZO pellet after failure. The results show that the reason for failure of LLZO is related to the contact between lithium and LLZO, and lithium dendrite may grow from one to another electrode.",Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,10.3390/cryst11040426
Improving the ionic conductivity of the LLZO–LZO thin film through indium doping,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A solid-state electrolyte with an ionic conductivity comparable to that of a liquid electrolyte is demanded of all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries. Li7 La3 Zr2 O12 (LLZO) is considered to be a promising candidate due to its good thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, and wide electrochemical window. However, the synthesis of a stable cubic-phase LLZO thin film with enhanced densification at a relatively low thermal treatment temperature is yet to be developed. Indium is predicted to be a possible dopant to stabilize the cubic-phase LLZO (c-LLZO). Herein, via a nanolayer stacking process, a LLZO–Li2 CO3 –In2 O3 multilayer solid electrolyte precursor was obtained. After thermal annealing at different temperatures, the effects of indium doping on the formation of c-LLZO and the ionic conductivities of the prepared LLZO–LZO thin film were systematically investigated. The highest ionic conductivity of 9.6 × 10−6 S·cm–1 was obtained at an annealing temperature of 800◦ C because the incorporation of indium promoted the formation of c-LLZO and the highly conductive LLZO–LZO interfaces. At the end, a model of LLZO–LZO interface-enhancing ionic conductivity was proposed. This work provides a new approach for the development of low-temperature LLZO-based, solid-state thin-film batteries.",Crystals,10.3390/mi12020134
Tri-doping of sol–gel synthesized garnet-type oxide solid-state electrolyte,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The rapidly growing Li-ion battery market has generated considerable demand for Li-ion batteries with improved performance and stability. All-solid-state Li-ion batteries offer promising safety and manufacturing enhancements. Herein, we examine the effect of substitutional doping at three cation sites in garnet-type Li7 La3 Zr2 O12 (LLZO) oxide ceramics produced by a sol–gel synthesis technique with the aim of enhancing the properties of solid-state electrolytes for use in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. Building on the results of mono-doping experiments with different doping elements and sites—Al, Ga, and Ge at the Li+ site; Rb at the La3+ site; and Ta and Nb at the Zr4+ site—we designed co-doped (Ga, Al, or Rb with Nb) and tri-doped (Ga or Al with Rb and Nb) samples by compositional optimization, and achieved a LLZO ceramic with a pure cubic phase, almost no secondary phase, uniform grain structure, and excellent Li-ion conductivity. The findings extend the current literature on the doping of LLZO ceramics and highlight the potential of the sol–gel method for the production of solid-state electrolytes.",Micromachines,10.1002/adfm.202001918
Rational Design of Mixed Electronic-Ionic Conducting Ti-Doping Li7La3Zr2O12 for Lithium Dendrites Suppression,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimGarnet structured ceramic electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) attracts much attention in solid-state lithium batteries for its high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and lack of reducible element. However, the application of LLZO has been hindered by severe dendrite penetration. The theoretical investigations on the mechanisms of lithium dendrite evolution are carried out, aiming at quantifying the promotion effects of overpotential and the limitation counterpart of bulk modulus. Since dendrites preferentially propagate along connected defects, while intrinsic defects are difficult to be compeletely eliminated, manipulation of overpotential should be a more feasible way for dendrites suppression. The mixed electronic-ionic conducting interphase, which in situ forms by introducing a Ti-doping Li56La24Zr15TiO96 (T-LLZO) interlayer between Li and LLZO, is suggested based on the proposed mechanisms, which effectively facilitates to alleviate the overpotential thus suppress the lithium dendrites theoretically. This strategy is verified experimentally by obviously improved stability of Li/Li symmetric cell using T-LLZO ceramic pellet electrolyte.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c02474
Effect of Postannealing on the Properties of a Ta-Doped Li7La3Zr2O12Solid Electrolyte Degraded by Li Dendrite Penetration,"© In this study, we investigated the effect of postannealing on the properties of a garnet-type Ta-doped Li6.55La3Zr1.55Ta0.45O12 (Ta-LLZO) ceramic solid electrolyte degraded by lithium (Li) dendrite penetration during electrochemical Li plating and stripping testing in a Li/Ta-LLZO/Li symmetric cell. After the electrochemical testing in the symmetric cell, the Ta-LLZO pellet was taken out of the cell and then annealed at 800 or 900 °C for 4 h in air. It was confirmed that locally discolored spots on the Ta-LLZO surface at which Li dendrite penetrated disappeared after postannealing. The total conductivity of the annealed Ta-LLZO pellet was lower than the initial one but was retained above 10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature. When the soft-shorted or degraded area size by Li dendrite penetration is localized and smaller than the area size for Ta-LLZO, it is expected that the degradation of the conductivity of annealed Ta-LLZO becomes smaller. Obtained electrochemical results indicate the possibility of reusing the degraded garnet-type solid electrolyte by Li dendrite penetration in another all-solid-state Li battery.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c03869
Kinetic versus Thermodynamic Stability of LLZO in Contact with Lithium Metal,"© Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet-based oxides are a promising class of solid electrolytes used as the separator in all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). While LLZO is considered to have a wide electrochemical stability window, its intrinsic stability in contact with lithium metal is not sufficiently well understood, and there is still a debate on the key question of whether LLZO does or does not form passivation layers before and during cycling. Utilizing both in situ and operando X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques, we reveal the presence of a kinetic barrier to the reduction of LLZO by Li metal, with the extent of oxygen-deficient interphase (ODI) formation depending sensitively on the energetics of Li metal arriving at the Li|LLZO interface. Despite the clear presence of a kinetic barrier to reduction, the electrochemical response of the Li|LLZO interface is unchanged by the presence of the ODI, indicating that ODI formation during electrochemical cycling does not hinder charge transfer across the Li|LLZO interface. Overall, these results reveal that the reactivity of LLZO with Li metal depends not only on the material properties of the adjoining phases (i.e., surface purity and active contact) and their resulting thermodynamic stability but also on the energy input at the interface and the resulting reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the presence of a kinetic barrier to reduction highlights the additional complexities governing the reactivity of solid-state interfaces in ASSBs and underscores the importance of operando characterization of interfacial stability to design more robust, high-performance protection strategies for solid electrolytes in contact with reactive electrodes.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1007/s41918-020-00076-1
Comprehensive Investigation into Garnet Electrolytes Toward Application-Oriented Solid Lithium Batteries,"© 2020, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University.Abstract: To satisfy the ever-increasing demand for higher energy density, solid-state batteries (SSBs) have received significant attention due to their potential in providing energy densities greater than 400 Wh kg−1. And as a key material in SSBs, the garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) electrolyte is particularly promising because of its high ionic conductivity at room temperature and excellent chemical stability against Li metal.

All ceramic cathode composite design and manufacturing towards low interfacial resistance for garnet-based solid-state lithium batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The critical factors that determine the performance and lifetime of solid-state batteries (SSBs) are driven by the electrode-electrolyte interfaces. The main challenge in fabricating all-oxide cathode composites for garnet-based SSBs has been lowering the thermal processing window in which both good contact and low interfacial resistance can be achieved. Here, we report an alternative ceramic processing strategy that enables the fabrication of all-oxide composite cathodes at an unusually low processing temperature without the use of extra sintering additives or a fluid electrolyte (polymer-gel or liquid electrolyte). We present specific examples of the most common LiFePO4 and LiCoO2 cathodes with a Li-garnet (Li7La3Zr2O12, LLZO) solid-electrolyte. We demonstrate an infiltration step to directly synthesize the LiCoO2 cathode from metal salts in a porous LLZO scaffold, resulting in the formation of a composite cathode such as LiCoO2-LLZO on top of a dense LLZO solid electrolyte at a low processing temperature of 700 °C. A promising discharge capacity of 118 mA h g-1 (3-4.05 V) with a low interfacial resistance of 62 Ohm cm2 is realized for LiCoO2 with a lithium anode, whereas critical phase instabilities for LiFePO4 are uncovered. Our findings encourage a move away from synthesis techniques that employ particle mixing and sintering to fabricate composites. We provide a blueprint for circumventing adverse interphase reactions according to chemistry and ceramic thermal processing budgets in the preparation of these ceramic interfaces as well as for increasing the number of reaction sites for high-performing composite cathodes for Li-garnet SSBs. In addition, the ceramic methods presented are scalable and mass manufacturable for the large-scale production of such composite cathodes for future industry.

Text mining for processing conditions of solid-state battery electrolyte,"© 2020 The AuthorsThe search for safer next-generation lithium ion batteries has motivated development of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs), owing to their wide electrochemical potential window, high ionic conductivity (10−3 to 10−4 S cm−1) and good chemical stability with a wide range of high charge capacity electrode materials. Still, optimization of the processing conditions of SSEs without sacrificing the performance of the complete cell assembly remains challenging. Insights extracted from scientific literature can accelerate the optimization of processing protocols of SSEs, yet digesting the information scattered over thousands of journal articles is tedious and time consuming. In this work, we demonstrate the role of text mining to automatically compile materials synthesis parameters across tens of thousands of scholarly publications using machine learning and natural language processing techniques that glean information into the processing of sulfide and oxide-based Li SSEs. We also gain insight on low temperature synthesis of highly potential oxide-based Li garnet electrolytes, notably Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), which can reduce the interface complexities during integration of the SSE into cell assembly. This work demonstrates the use of text and data mining to expedite the development of all-solid-state Li metal batteries by guiding hypotheses during experimental design.",Electrochemistry Communications,10.1038/s41598-020-75456-0
Direct observation of lithium metal dendrites with ceramic solid electrolyte,"© 2020, The Author(s).Dendrite formation, which could cause a battery short circuit, occurs in batteries that contain lithium metal anodes. In order to suppress dendrite growth, the use of electrolytes with a high shear modulus is suggested as an ionic conductive separator in batteries. One promising candidate for this application is Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) because it has excellent mechanical properties and chemical stability. In this work, in situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique was employed to monitor the interface behavior between lithium metal and LLZO electrolyte during cycling with pressure. Using the obtained SEM images, videos were created that show the inhomogeneous dissolution and deposition of lithium, which induce dendrite growth. The energy dispersive spectroscopy analyses of dendrites indicate the presence of Li, C, and O elements. Moreover, the cross-section mapping comparison of the LLZO shows the inhomogeneous distribution of La, Zr, and C after cycling that was caused by lithium loss near the Li electrode and possible side reactions. This work demonstrates the morphological and chemical evolution that occurs during cycling in a symmetrical Li–Li cell that contains LLZO. Although the superior mechanical properties of LLZO make it an excellent electrolyte candidate for batteries, the further improvement of the electrochemical stabilization of the garnet–lithium metal interface is suggested.",Scientific Reports,10.1038/s41467-020-19004-4
Enabling “lithium-free” manufacturing of pure lithium metal solid-state batteries through in situ plating,"© 2020, The Author(s).The coupling of solid-state electrolytes with a Li-metal anode and state-of-the-art (SOA) cathode materials is a promising path to develop inherently safe batteries with high energy density (>1000 Wh L−1). However, integrating metallic Li with solid-electrolytes using scalable processes is not only challenging, but also adds extraneous volume since SOA cathodes are fully lithiated. Here we show the potential for “Li-free” battery manufacturing using the Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) electrolyte. We demonstrate that Li-metal anodes >20 μm can be electroplated onto a current collector in situ without LLZO degradation and we propose a model to relate electrochemical and nucleation behavior. A full cell consisting of in situ formed Li, LLZO, and NCA is demonstrated, which exhibits stable cycling over 50 cycles with high Coulombic efficiencies. These findings demonstrate the viability of “Li-free” configurations using LLZO which may guide the design and manufacturing of high energy density solid-state batteries.",Nature Communications,10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100522

Applying the SSRS process with the addition of 1 wt% CuO decreased the sintering temperature for 0.5 mol%Ta-doped LLZTO pellets having over 90% relative density from 1250 to 1100 °C to reduce Li loss. The 1 wt% CuO addition did not lead to secondary phase formation as detected by XRD, nor to appreciable electronic conduction below 100 °C as measured by four-point probe method. The 1 wt% CuO-mixed LLZTO pellet exhibited high conductivity of approximately 3.0 × 10−4 S·cm−1 (bulk) and 5.45x10−5 S·cm−1 (grain boundary). The mechanism of CuO function as a sintering aid is presumed to be enabling liquid-phase sintering along with enhancing the decomposition of LiOH. The combined SSRS process along with optimized CuO sintering aid addition is a one-step process that is a practical technique to enhance the preparation of LLZO-based electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries.",Journal of Materials Science,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.06.050
"Broad temperature dependence, high conductivity, and structure-property relations of cold sintering of LLZO-based composite electrolytes","© 2020 Elsevier LtdThe garnet-type LLZO is one of the most attractive, highly conductive ceramic materials for all-solid-state Li batteries. However, there are so many challenges, such as high temperature sintering for many hours, and air and moisture sensitivity of the materials. In this study, to overcome these obstacles for practical application, we synthesized high conductivity LLZO raw material with Mg, Sr substitution and applied a low temperature sintering process, namely cold sintering, to densify the LLZO-SM-based composites. The LLZO-SM-base composite electrolyte was densified using cold sintering process with DMF as a partially transient liquid phase at 120 °C, and the resulting composite shows a high conductivity of 10−4 S/cm. Moreover, the cold sintered composite electrolyte exhibits high conductivity under a wide range of temperature, as well as good microstructures and grain boundary interfaces. Furthermore, the all-solid-state Li-ion battery with cold sintered composite delivering high capacity was fabricated as a basic demonstration. These promising results demonstrated the feasibility of the cold sintering process for development of solid-state electrolytes and fabrication of all-solid-state Li batteries.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228752
A three dimensional interconnected Li7La3Zr2O12 framework composite solid electrolyte utilizing lignosulfonate/ cellulose nanofiber bio-template for high performance lithium ion batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) exhibit high ionic conductivity and flexibility due to the intimate interactions between ceramic and polymer matrix, and it is of practical interest to enhance CSEs performance. Herein, a flexible, high ion conductive, and electrochemically stable CSE, consisting of three-dimensional (3D) interconnected Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) framework and poly (ethylene oxide) - LiC2F6NO4S2 (PEO-LiTFSI) polymer, has been successfully prepared using lignosulfonate/cellulose nanofiber (LS-CNF) networks as a bio-template. The 3D porous LS-CNF network effectively promotes the adsorption and dispersion of LLZO precursors, which, upon calcination, leads to the formation of interconnected LLZO framework with homogeneous and small ceramic branches, thus offering multiple ion conductance pathways. The as-prepared CSE shows very high ionic conductivity of 1.37 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a high lithium ion transference number of 0.59 at 30 °C with a wide electrochemical stability window of 5.4 V vs. Li/Li+. The assembled LIBs exhibit a high initial capacity of 134 mAh·g−1 at 0.5C even after 100 cycles. This facile strategy for designing 3D interconnected and durable LLZO frameworks reveals great potential to develop high-performance solid-state electrolytes for the next-generation high energy density LIBs.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.154915
Enhance electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 cathode material by Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 and carbon co-coating surface modification,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.A composite solid electrolyte based on Al-doped Li7-3xAlxLa3Zr2O12 (LALZO) was synthesized by the sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to characterize Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) precursors with different Al doping concentrations. The results show that LLZO precursor doped with 0.4 mol% Al (LALZO-4) has high stability and good crystallinity. Further, this composite solid electrolyte was co-coated with carbon to optimize the LiFePO4 battery. Electrochemical performance tests show that the LiFePO4/C battery with 5% LALZO-4 precursor (LFP-5) exists in the form of uniformly dispersed spherical particles, and exhibits excellent cycling stability and high rate performance. In addition, the LALZO-4 coating layer can increase the diffusion rate by reducing the charge transfer resistance.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1021/acsami.0c15004
3D Coral-like LLZO/PVDF Composite Electrolytes with Enhanced Ionic Conductivity and Mechanical Flexibility for Solid-State Lithium Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) are very promising for high-energy lithium-metal batteries as they combine the advantages of polymeric and ceramic electrolytes. The dimensions and morphologies of active ceramic fillers play critical roles in determining the electrochemical and mechanical performances of CPEs. Herein, a coral-like LLZO (Li6.4La3Zr2Al0.2O12) is designed and used as a 3D active nanofiller in a poly(vinylidene difluoride) polymer matrix. Building 3D interconnected frameworks endows the as-made CPE membranes with an enhanced ionic conductivity (1.51 × 10-4 S cm-1) at room temperature and an enlarged tensile strength up to 5.9 MPa. As a consequence, the flexible 3D-architectured CPE enables a steady lithium plating/stripping cycling over 200 h without a short circuit. Moreover, the assembled solid-state Li|LiFePO4 cells using the electrolyte exhibit decent cycling performance (95.2% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 C) and excellent rate capability (120 mA h g-1 at 3 C).

Thermally driven interfacial degradation between Li7La3Zr2O12 electrolyte and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 cathode,"© 2020 American Chemical SocietySolid-state batteries offer higher energy density and enhanced safety compared to the present lithium-ion batteries using liquid electrolytes. A challenge to implement them is the high resistances, especially at the solid electrolyte interface with the cathode. Sintering at elevated temperature is needed in order to get good contact between the ceramic solid electrolyte and oxide cathodes and thus to reduce contact resistances. Many solid electrolyte and cathode materials react to form secondary phases. It is necessary to find out which phases arise as a result of interface sintering and evaluate their effect on electrochemical properties. In this work, we assessed the interfacial reactions between LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) and Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) as a function of temperature in air. We prepared model systems by depositing thin-film NMC622 cathode layers on LLZO pellets. The thin-film cathode approach enabled us to use interface-sensitive techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy in the near-edge as well as the extended regimes and identify the onset of detrimental reactions. We found that the Ni and Co chemical environments change already at moderate temperatures, on-setting from 500 °C and becoming especially prominent at 700 °C. By analyzing spectroscopy results along with X-ray diffraction, we identified Li2CO3, La2Zr2O7, and La(Ni,Co)O3 as the secondary phases that formed at 700 °C. The interfacial resistance for Li transfer, measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, increases significantly upon the onset and evolution of the detected interface chemistry. Our findings suggest that limiting the bonding temperature and avoiding CO2 in the sintering environment can help to remedy the interfacial degradation.",Chemistry of Materials,10.7498/aps.69.20201191
Physical issues in solid garnet batteries 石榴石型固态锂电池中的物理问题,"Copyright © 2019 Acta Physica Sinica. All rights reserved.Solid-state lithium batteries with solid electrolytes have the potential to achieve high energy density and safety, which promise to be used in the electric vehicles and wearable devices. The garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has attracted a great deal of attention due to its high ionic conductivity and good chemical stability to lithium metal. Here in this paper, based on recent progress, this review provides a fundamental understanding of garnet-based electrolytes by evaluating the thermodynamic/kinetics stability and analyzing the Li+ conduction mechanism of ceramics and composite garnet electrolytes. To address the key factors influencing the cyclability and safety of solid-state batteries, the rational design of solid electrolyte/electrode interfaces is discussed in terms of interface matching, charge transfer, strain/stress, thermal stability, etc. Finally, the design guidelines of high-energy-density solid-state batteries are introduced by analyzing the fabrication of electrodes, solid electrolyte and bipolar current collectors.

The effects of electric field distribution on the interface stability in solid electrolytes,"© 2020 The Electrochemical Society (“ECS”).Ceramic electrolytes could potentially enable Li metal anodes, leading to safer and more energy dense solid-state batteries. However, it has been hypothesized that electric field amplification at electrode edges can destabilize the interface and lead to short circuiting during charging. By comparing models of the electric field distribution at the electrode/electrolyte interface for varying electrode geometries with experimental solid-electrolyte systems, we show that areas of high electric field can localize at sharp corners, which may facilitate Li metal penetration at these locations. Symmetric Li/ Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZO) cells were cycled until failure and the spatial distribution of the degradation was analyzed using electron microscopy. We report a decrease in nominal critical current density (CCD) from 1.48 to 1.26 mA cm−2 due to a 15% increase in electric field from edge effects. Moreover, when considering the CCD locally at spots of high electric field amplification, we find current densities of at least 4 mA cm−2 can still be sustained. Non-uniform electric field distributions at the Li/LLZO interface could play a major role in determining cycling capabilities and failure modes of solid-state batteries and may also have important implications for the manufacturing of Li metal battery electrodes.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.136955
LiBO2-modified LiCoO2 as an efficient cathode with garnet framework Li6.75La3Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 electrolyte toward building all-solid-state lithium battery for high-temperature operation,"© 2020Garnet-based all-solid-state Li-ion batteries (ASSLIBs) suffer from high interfacial resistance at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Herein, we propose a LiBO2 (LBO) modification over a LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode to improve the interfacial contact and subsequently, the electrochemical performance of the cell. The High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) images of the cathode particle show that the LiBO2 (LBO) content on the LCO surface effectively improves the electrode/electrolyte interface. In the cut-off voltage range of 3 – 4.3 V vs. Li, the LBO-LCO maintains 50% of its initial capacity (60 mAh g–1) after the 40th cycle, which is much higher than bare LCO in the ASSLIB configuration. The LBO layer over LCO enhances the Li-ion diffusion kinetics and eventually improves the electrochemical performance of the cell. To suppress the mechanical degradation of the electrode/electrolyte interface, we have reduced the working potential window to 3 – 4.1 V vs. Li, where the LBO-modified LCO provides an initial discharge capacity of 101 mAh g–1 and assists in realizing improved cyclic performance in comparison with the conventional potential window.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.136965
High-purity and high-density cubic phase of Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolytes by controlling surface/volume ratio and sintering pressure,"© 2020The Li+ conductivity of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte mainly depends on the bulk density and the purity of cubic phase. However, current studies show that high-density and high-purity cubic phase is extremely difficult to be obtained due to the easy lithium loss. Herein, the evolutions of phase composition and microstructure of LLZO are systematically studied by precisely controlling the surface/volume ratio and sintering pressure. Results show that the surface/volume ratio affects the phase composition by regulating the lithium content per unit volume. With too large surface/volume ratio of > 0.32 mm−1, lithium element in unit volume is too poor to synthesize cubic phase LLZO. With too small surface/volume ratio of < 0.23 mm−1, lithium element per unit volume is too rich which lead to the formation of tetragonal phase LLZO. The optimal surface/volume ratio for obtaining high-purity cubic phase is 0.23 ~ 0.32 cm−1. Besides, pure cubic phase can only be obtained at 0 ~ 10 MPa, higher pressure of 15 ~ 20 MPa will accelerates lithium loss which result in the formation of La2Zr2O7 and La2O3 phases. The density of pure cubic phase increases with the sintering pressure, bulks sintered with 10 MPa have a high relative density of 99.8%. In conclusion, both the surface/volume ratio and sintering pressure are critical for obtaining high-density and high-purity cubic phase.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105196
Performance and behavior of LLZO-based composite polymer electrolyte for lithium metal electrode with high capacity utilization,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdA thin membrane (≈47 μm) of a Celgard separator-reinforced cross-linked LiTFSI-PEO-Pyr14TFSI-LLZO composite polymer electrolyte (CgCPE) was prepared and investigated for its ability to suppress the formation and propagation of high surface area lithium (HSAL) with dendritic morphology. The membrane shows superior cycling stability in Li||Li-symmetric cells under high capacity utilization (5 mAh/cm2) for up to 2000 h. Using a combination of conventional laboratory techniques and nondestructive synchrotron X-ray tomography, the synergetic effect of the membrane components towards homogenous lithium electrodeposition/dissolution was revealed. The modulated ion migration in CgCPE and decreased interfacial/interphasial resistance ensures an evenly regulated Li-ion flux during deposition. While, the good mechanical properties of the CgCPE membrane were maintained up to a capacity utilization of 15 mAh/cm2. Based on the results, an approach for a hybrid solid electrolyte to control lithium electrodeposition for Li metal electrodes with high capacity utilization is provided, and furthermore, such an approach could be further used for lithium metal batteries with high energy density and safety.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.jechem.2020.03.017
Status and prospect of garnet/polymer solid composite electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium batteries,"© 2020Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), such as polyethylene oxide (PEO), are characteristic of good flexibility and excellent processability, but they suffer from low ionic conductivity and small Li+ transference number at ambient temperature. Inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs), garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 and its derivatives (LLZO-based) in particular, possess high ionic conductivity at room temperature, wide electrochemical stability window, large Li+ transference number as well as good stability against Li metal anode. Nevertheless, lithium dendrites growth, interfacial contact issue and brittle nature of LLZO-based ceramic electrolytes prevent their practical applications. In response to these shortcomings, LLZO-based/polymer solid composite electrolytes (SCEs), taking complementary advantages of two kinds of electrolytes, and thus simultaneously improving the electrode wettability, ionic conductivity and mechanical strength, have been made to develop high-performance SCEs in recent years.

Electrochemical and Surface Chemistry Analysis of Lithium Lanthanum Zirconium Tantalum Oxide (LLZTO)/Liquid Electrolyte (LE) Interfaces,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.A stable solid electrolyte/liquid electrolyte (SE/LE) interface is essential to enable hybrid electrolytes, where the SE protects Li metal anodes and the LE improves SE/cathode interfacial kinetics. However, previous reports have shown that the promising SE Lithium Lanthanum Zirconium Tantalum Oxide (LLZTO) reacts with LiPF6-based state-of-the-art LEs. This work aims to identify the source of this instability and propose approaches to ameliorate it. This is achieved by studying and isolating the effects of organic solvents and Li salts present in the LE on LLZTO. The results indicate that the reactions with the typical solvents are not as detrimental as with the corresponding salts. For example, LiPF6 salt reacts with LLZTO to form LiF, LaF3 and ZrF4, which leads to an increased SE/LE interfacial resistance (Rinterface). The Rinterface after reacting with LiPF6 and LiBOB salts is ~120 and 2000 Ohms.cm2, respectively. However, LiTFSI salt is compatible with LLZTO with Rinterface ~55 Ohms.cm2. Furthermore, optimization of the LiTFSI salt concentration (3 M) results in an Rinterface of ~30 Ohms.cm2. We demonstrate preliminary cycling of Li/LLZTO/LE/NCA cells with ~100% utilization and 98.5% capacity retention over 10 cycles. Overall, this study provides a step towards the successful implementation of hybrid electrolytes in Li metal batteries.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1021/acsaem.0c02053

Formation mechanism of sol-gel synthesized Li7−3xAlxLa3Zr2O12 and the influence of abnormal grain growth on ionic conductivity,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.The development of solid-state batteries requires the optimization of ceramic electrolyte such as garnet type cubic Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO). Exploration of powders formation mechanism and the sintering behavior of ceramics are crucial to acquire high performance LLZO electrolytes. This study adopts quantitative analysis based on X-ray adiabatic principle to investigate the formation mechanism of Li7−3xAlxLa3Zr2O12 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, LALZO) powders synthesized by sol-gel method. The whole calcination procedure could be divided into three stages as follows, La2Zr2O7(LZO) formation (<750 °C), transformation from LZO to LLZO (750 °C–850 °C) and LLZO decomposition (>850 °C). The phase, morphology and conductivity of LALZO ceramics demonstrate abnormal grain growth (AGG) caused by over-sintering leads to random orientation and conductivity deterioration. The optimal sintering condition could not only make grains bound tightly but also avoid AGG. Ceramics consist of LALZO (x = 0.25) exhibit better total ionic conductivity of 3.08 × 10−4 S cm−1 (Ea = 0.27 eV) with density of 92.5% after sintering at 1100 °C for 15 h.

Towards a high-performance garnet-based solid-state Li metal battery: A perspective on recent advances,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Garnet-based solid-state Li metal batteries have been widely considered one of the most promising next-generation energy storage systems. However, the performance of these batteries is plagued by various limitations caused by the solid-state electrolyte (SSE). The poor wetting of lithium on the garnet surface diminishes the contact between the anode and electrolyte, leading to extremely high anode interfacial resistance. Similarly, the point-to-point contact between the cathode and electrolyte leads to high impedance on the cathode side. Moreover, although the SSE serves a firm barrier separating the anode and cathode, lithium dendrites can still grow through, causing a short circuit. Finally, the solid/solid interface cannot be well maintained under cycling at high current density and capacity. Recently, remarkable progress has been achieved in garnet electrolyte to resolve these problems towards the aim of a high-performance solid-state Li metal battery. In this perspective, we highlight various recent advances in the field of garnet-based solid-state battery, including improving the anode/electrolyte interface, lithium dendrite detection, reducing cathode impedance, and electrolyte architecture design.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1021/acsaem.0c00935
Importance of Composite Electrolyte Processing to Improve the Kinetics and Energy Density of Li Metal Solid-State Batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Solid-state batteries with a Li metal anode and polymer-ceramic electrolytes hold the promise to boost safety and energy density, provided that stable conductive interfaces are achieved. Here, by focusing on the composite electrolyte system LLZO-PEO(LiTFSI), i.e., Li-ion conductive doped-Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet fillers embedded within the Li-ion conductive poly(ethylene oxide) matrix, we report on the impact that electrolyte processing has on its mesostructure and ultimately on full cell kinetics. Two distinct solvent-based routes are used to prepare composite membranes with a fixed composition of 10 vol % LLZO but with different filler distributions and particle sizes (18 vs 1 μm). Both membranes have a similar Li-ion conductivity of ∼0.4 mS·cm-1 at 70 °C as the bulk polymer matrix drives the macroscopic Li-ion transport. However, when assembled with Li metal/LiFePO4 (LFP) electrodes, the resultant cells show distinct performances. The capacity is enhanced, from 139 to 150 mAh·g-1 at C/10 and from 60 to 97 mAh·g-1 at C/2, when the 1-μm-size LLZO fillers are homogeneously distributed within the membrane. In addition, by minimizing the electrolyte thickness, the capacity can be further enhanced to 168 mAh·g-1 at C/10, which is nearly the theoretical capacity of LFP (170 mAh·g-1). A set of electrochemical and structural characterization techniques, such as galvanostatic cycling, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, potentiostatic intermittent titration, and scanning electron microscopy, allow one to identify the electrolyte-Li metal interface stability as the dominating source of the rate capability behavior of the full cells. LLZO fillers with a high surface area and even distribution within the PEO matrix are the key to allow fast and reversible Li-ion flux by minimizing Li concentration gradients. These characteristics are crucial to maximize battery kinetics and capacity utilization. Finally, the design rules of solid-state batteries containing composite electrolytes are proposed to fulfill the industry requirements for practical applications.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1039/d0ta04947f
Origin of intergranular Li metal propagation in garnet-based solid electrolyte by direct electronic structure analysis and performance improvement by bandgap engineering,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Garnet-structured oxide electrolytes (Li7La3Zr2O12, LLZO) have significant advantage of being chemically and electrochemically stable against Li metals and allow implementation in Li metal batteries. However, a short-circuit failure due to Li penetration through the LLZO electrolyte has remained a crucial issue for safety and is a major hurdle for Li-based batteries to overcome. In, we investigated a mechanism of Li dendrite formation for the crystalline Ta-doped LLZO (LLZTO) electrolyte by examining their energy band structures and defect states using reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy (REELS), scanning photoelectron microscopy (SPEM), and nanoscale charge-based deep level transient spectroscopy (Nano Q-DLTS) techniques. The experimental results revealed that the Schottky barrier height (SBH) was lowered by 0.5 eV due to defect states localized in grain boundaries and that the metallic Li propagation along the grain boundaries is caused by the SBH reduction. Based on analytical results, the laser annealing of LLZTO was performed via bandgap engineering method to suppress the Li dendrite formation by forming a mixed surface layer of amorphous LLZTO and Li2O2, which has a wide bandgap to block the electron injection into the grain boundaries. The electrochemical measurements of laser-treated LLZTO demonstrated that the stability and cycling performance were significantly improved. This study sheds light on the importance of electronic structure, in particular, the defect states to develop high-performance oxide solid electrolytes for Li metal batteries and the practicality of surface modification by laser treatment.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1002/admi.202000425
Lithium Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 Electrolyte for All-Solid-State Batteries: Closing the Gap between Bulk and Thin Film Li-Ion Conductivities,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe high ionic conductivity and wide electrochemical stability of the lithium garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) make it a viable solid electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium batteries with superior capacity and power densities. Contrary to common ceramic processing routes of bulk pellets, thin film solid electrolytes could enable large-area fabrication, and increase energy and power densities by reducing the bulkiness, weight and critically, the area-specific resistance of the electrolyte. Fabrication of LLZO films has nonetheless been challenging because of lithium losses and formation of impurity phases that result in low densities and poor ionic conductivities as compared to bulk pellets. Here, a scalable method for fabricating submicron films of LLZO employing co-sputtering from doped LLZO and Li2O targets is presented. A record ionic conductivity of 1.9 × 10−4 S cm–1 is measured for dense and uniform cubic-phase Ga-substituted LLZO films annealed at 700 °C in oxygen, which is comparable to the values in high-temperature sintered pellets and outperforms by one order of magnitude the latest record for LLZO thin films as well as the typical conductivities in the well-established LiPON electrolyte. This result is an important milestone to realize all-vacuum deposited solid-state batteries with higher power density.",Advanced Materials Interfaces,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.136536
Ga-doped lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide electrolyte for solid-state Li batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdCubic-phase Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet is a promising solid electrolyte candidate for next-generation Li batteries. As a viable approach, the desired cubic-phase formation of LLZO relies on elemental doping. In this regard, various dopants such as Al and Ga are doped into the LLZO samples, which are synthesized using a solid-state reaction method. The Al- and Ga-doped LLZO can transform to a cubic-phase garnet at 900 °C. After 1200 °C sintering, a Li2ZrO3 impurity phase is found for the Al-doped LLZO pellet, which still shows many voids and inhomogeneous particles on the surface. The Ga doping seems to be attractive since it can effectively stabilize the cubic phase and desired microstructure within 900–1200 °C. Based on the optimized Ga-doped LLZO (LGLZO), various electrolyte architecture designs are developed that include LGLZO pellet electrolytes with and without poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)-LGLZO coating, and hybrid electrolyte layers of PEO-LiTFSI, PEO-LGLZO, and PEO-LiTFSI-LGLZO composites.

"Rapid, high-temperature microwave soldering toward a high-performance cathode/electrolyte interface","© 2020Solid-state lithium batteries using inorganic electrolytes are expected to revolutionize energy storage systems due to their better safety and high energy density. However, their application is greatly hindered by the poor solid-solid interface between the solid-state electrolyte (SSE) and electrodes, particularly the cathode. Herein, we report a facile strategy to address the high cathode/SSE interfacial resistance through rapid, high-temperature microwave soldering. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we soldered a garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) SSE with a V2O5 cathode, which feature high thermal stability and suitable melting temperatures. Our microwave soldering technique can selectively melt the surface of the granular V2O5 and rapidly form an intact and continuous cathode layer with tightly embedded carbon black nanoparticles, leading to a remarkable 690-time increase of the electronic conductivity of cathode. Additionally, the melted V2O5 cathode is conformally soldered to the garnet electrolyte, resulting in a 28-fold decrease of the cathode/garnet interfacial resistance (from 14.4 ​kΩ ​cm2to 0.5 ​kΩ ​cm2. As a result, this all-solid-state full cell displays a low overall resistance of 0.3 ​kΩ ​cm2 at 100 ​°C, which enables stable cyclability of the battery without the addition of liquid/polymer electrolyte. The fast microwave soldering strategy constitutes a significant step towards the development of the all-solid-state batteries.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.cclet.2020.03.015

Several studies show that introduction of alumina during synthesis can greatly improve the density and ionic conductivity of garnet electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), but the reason of poor sinterability of LLZO is still unclear. In this study, we reveal that lithium carbonate, which has a high decomposition temperature and covers on the particle surface of LLZO, is the underlying reason that handicaps the sinterability of Li-Garnet electrolyte in air. The addition of alumina promotes the decomposition of Li2CO3 (down to 400°C) and the concomitant product LiAlO2, as a fast Li-ion conductor, facilitates the sintering process and bulids a fast Li-ion conducting network along the grain-boundaries, significantly increasing the ionic conductivity of Li-Garnet electrolyte. By the conventional solid state sintering, the 10 mol% Al2O3 modified Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZT-10Al2O3) electrolyte reaches a relative density of 96% and shows a conductivity of 0.31 mS cm−1 at room temperature. The prepared LLZT-10Al2O3 electrolyte exhibits a good wetting property toward metallic Li electrode with an interfacial resistance of 59 Ω cm2 compared to 1270 Ω cm2 for LLZT/Li. This work provides a fundamental understanding and a valuable strategy for developing high performance garnet-type electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium batteries.",International Journal of Energy Research,10.1007/s11581-020-03600-x
Enhancement of cycling stability of all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries with composite polymer electrolytes incorporating Li6.25La3Zr2Al0.25O12 nanofibers,"© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) with cubic phase structure is a kind of lithium-ion-conducting nanoparticles. According to the previous studies, incorporation of c-LLZO can improve electrochemical properties of PEO-based composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). Therefore, in our study, we synthesized a kind of room-temperature-stable cubic phase LLZAO (Li6.25La3Zr2Al0.25O12) nanofibers, and we aimed to confirm the optimal content of LLZAO nanofibers in PEO-based CPEs. With the incorporating 10 wt% LLZAO nanofibers, ionic conductivity of CPEs are 9.87×10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C and 8.66×10−4 S cm−1 at 60 °C. The Li/CPE incorporating 10 wt% LLZAO nanofibers/Li symmetric cell exhibits little voltage fluctuation in 1000 cycles under a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2, demonstrating better cycling stability with long cycle life. The LiFePO4/CPE incorporating 10 wt% LLZAO nanofibers/Li cell has a high initial discharge-specific capacity of 155.6 mAh g−1 under 0.1 C rate at 60 °C and remains 94.5% of capacity after 100 cycles. This cell also has great cycling performance under 0.2 C and 0.5 C rate, indicating good rate performance. Our work indicates that incorporation of LLZAO nanofibers enhances electrochemical properties and cycling stability of PEO-based all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries.",Ionics,10.1111/jace.17177
Predicting the flexural strength of Li-ion-conducting garnet type oxide for solid-state-batteries,"© 2020 The American Ceramic SocietyThe mechanical strength of solid-state electrolytes is crucial for applications in solid-state batteries (eg block lithium dendrites and withhold the stress due to volume expansion of the electrode). We determined the flexural strength of doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12, LLCZN) garnet type electrolyte as ~8.6 ± 1.5 MPa to ~51.5 ± 4.8 MPa as functions of porosity and grain size. Based on the experimental results, a series of theoretical models were established to obtain empirical equations to study the effects of porosity and grain size. Our further experiments demonstrate that the empirical equations can be used to predict the flexural strength of garnet type oxides based on its microstructure (porosity and grain size). Optimization of the grain size of fully dense garnet oxide can increase the strength up to ~106.0 ± 11.6 MPa (tape casting-sintering method with a grain size of ~2.8 µm).",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1007/s11581-020-03580-y
Lithium ionic conductivity of Li7-3xFexLa3Zr2O12 ceramics by the Pechini method,"© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) with garnet structure has been acknowledged as a promising solid electrolyte for the next generation Li-ion batteries owing to its high chemical stability against Li metal and relatively high Li-ion conductivity. In this work, Li7-3xFexLa3Zr2O12 ceramics were prepared by the Pechini method. The influence of Fe substitution on the structure and microstructure of LLZO powder and ceramic were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), TG (DSC)-MS, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and impedance spectroscopy. TG-MS and XRD results indicated that LLZO powder could be formed around 750 °C. SEM results showed that the introduction of Fe accelerated densification of LLZO ceramic.

Its ionic conductivity and activation energy were 4.28 × 10−4 S/cm and 0.27 eV at 30 °C, respectively.",Ionics,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228379
Transition metal dichalcogenides in alliance with Ag ameliorate the interfacial connection between Li anode and garnet solid electrolyte,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Solid-state batteries (SSBs) exhibit a promising prospect due to their potential in terms of safety and energy densities. As an oxide electrolyte, cubic garnet solid electrolyte (cubic-Li7La3Zr2O12) attracts wide attention due to the high ionic conductivity. However, the problem of poor contact between garnet solid electrolyte and lithium impairs the development of solid electrolytes. Herein, we demonstrate an effective modification method to cope with the interface issue between electrolyte and Li metal by introducing an Ag@WSe2 composite layer. By applying this method, the interfacial resistance between the garnet electrolyte and Li metal is reduced to ~12.5 Ω cm2, which is nearly 150 times lower than the value of 1900 Ω cm2 before modification. The WSe2 acts as a framework to immobilize Ag, while Ag forms an Ag–Li alloy with lithium for lithium ions transportation. And other Ag@TMDs (transition metal dichalcogenides) composites have also been proven to have similar effects. In addition, the Li | Ag@WSe2-LLZO | LFP full cell demonstrates a satisfactory capacity and excellent cycle stability (500 cycles with 90% capacity retention rate) at room temperature.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1039/d0ta05014h
Electrochemical and compositional characterization of solid interphase layers in an interface-modified solid-state Li-sulfur battery,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The Li+ transport kinetics at the solid-solid electrode|electrolyte interfaces are crucial for the stable and durable performance of solid-state batteries (SSBs). A poor interface due to mechanical problems and/or (electro-)chemical instabilities will curtail the performance of such batteries. Herein, we present a detailed study on the interfaces of a lithium-sulfur (Li-S) SSB with a Li anode, Li-garnet (LLZO) solid electrolyte (SE), and a sulfur-carbon composite as the cathode. Interlayer gels based on ionic liquids were introduced to improve the interfacial properties of the system. For Li symmetric cells, the strategy resulted in a decrease in cell resistance by about a factor of five and stable voltage profiles with low overpotentials (∼300 mV at 0.4 mA cm-2 after >450 hours). Furthermore, the LLZO SE efficiently blocked the polysulfide shuttle to the Li anode. Due to the advantageous features of the design, good electrochemical performance was obtained, where the Li-S SSB delivered an initial discharge capacity of ca. 1360 mA h gsulfur-1 and a discharge capacity of ca. 570 mA h gsulfur-1 after 100 cycles. Detailed electrochemical and compositional characterization of the interphase layers was performed at the Li anode and sulfur cathode interfaces through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), applying depth-profiling techniques, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The results revealed the presence of interphase nano-layers with varying thicknesses on the LLZO surface which contained organic and inorganic species.

LLZO@EmimFSI@PEO derived hybrid solid electrolyte for high-energy lithium metal batteries,"© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Although all-solid-state batteries have good safety and high energy density, they still need to explore high performance solid-state electrolytes to achieve high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window and excellent mechanical properties. In this work, we designed a hybrid solid electrolyte to solve these problems via mixing PEO, ionic liquid EmimFSI (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide), LLZO (Li6.5Mg0.05La3Zr1.6Ta0.4O12) and lithium salt, which aimed at suppression of PEO crystallization and employed to improve the mechanical and electrochemical stability. Accordingly, the LLZO@EmimFSI@PEO derived hybrid solid electrolyte provides an ionic conductivity of 1.0×10-4 S cm-1 at 40oC and electrochemical stability window above 5.0 V vs. Li/Li+.

The natural critical current density limit for Li7La3Zr2O12garnets,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Ceramic batteries equipped with Li-metal anodes are expected to double the energy density of conventional Li-ion batteries. Besides high energy densities, also high power is needed when batteries have to be developed for electric vehicles. Practically speaking, so-called critical current densities (CCD) higher than 3 mA cm-2 are needed to realize such systems. As yet, this value has, however, not been achieved for garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) being one of the most promising ceramic electrolytes. Most likely, CCD values are influenced by the area specific resistance (ASR) governing ionic transport across the Li|electrolyte interface. Here, single crystals of LLZO with adjusted ASR are used to quantify this relationship in a systematic manner. It turned out that CCD values exponentially decrease with increasing ASR. The highest obtained CCD value was as high as 280 μA cm-2. This value should be regarded as the room-temperature limit for LLZO when no external pressure is applied. Concluding, for polycrystalline samples either stack pressure or a significant increase of the interfacial area is needed to reach current densities equal or higher than the above-mentioned target value.

Fast Charge Transfer across the Li7La3Zr2O12Solid Electrolyte/LiCoO2Cathode Interface Enabled by an Interphase-Engineered All-Thin-Film Architecture,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Lithium garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is being investigated as a potential solid electrolyte for next-generation solid-state batteries owing to its high ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability against metallic lithium and high potential cathodes. While the LLZO/Li metal anode interface has been thoroughly investigated to achieve almost negligible interface resistances, the LLZO/cathode interface still suffers from high interfacial resistances mainly due to the high-temperature sintering required for proper ceramic bonding. In this work, the LLZO solid electrolyte/LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode interface is investigated in an all-thin-film model system. This architecture provides an easy access to the interface for in situ and ex situ characterization, allowing one to identify the degradation processes taking place under high-temperature cosintering and to test solutions such as interface modifications. Introducing an in situ-lithiated Nb2O5 diffusion barrier at the interface, we were able to lower the LLZO/LCO charge transfer resistance to about 50 ω cm2, a 3-fold reduction with respect to previously reported values. The low interfacial resistance combined with the high conductance through the LLZO thin-film electrolyte allows one to investigate the charge transfer at high charge-discharge rates, unlike in bulk systems. At 1C, discharge capacities of about 140 mA h g-1 were measured, and at 10C, 60% of the theoretical capacity was retained with a cycle life over 100 cycles. Besides the role of this architecture in the interface investigation, this work also constitutes a milestone in the development of thin-film solid-state batteries with higher power densities.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c03558
"Anomalies in Bulk Ion Transport in the Solid Solutions of Li7La3M2O12(M = Hf, Sn) and Li5La3Ta2O12","Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Cubic Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO), stabilized by supervalent cations, is one of the most promising oxide electrolyte to realize inherently safe all-solid-state batteries. It is of great interest to evaluate the strategy of supervalent stabilization in similar compounds and to describe its effect on ionic bulk conductivity σ′bulk. Here, we synthesized solid solutions of Li7-xLa3M2-xTaxO12 with M = Hf, Sn over the full compositional range (x = 0, 0.25..2). It turned out that Ta contents at x of 0.25 (M = Hf, LLHTO) and 0.5 (M = Sn, LLSTO) are necessary to yield phase pure cubic Li7-xLa3M2-xTaxO12. The maximum in total conductivity for LLHTO (2 × 10-4 S cm-1) is achieved for x = 1.0; the associated activation energy is 0.46 eV. At x = 0.5 and x = 1.0, we observe two conductivity anomalies that are qualitatively in agreement with the rule of Meyer and Neldel. For LLSTO, at x = 0.75 the conductivity σ′bulk turned out to be 7.94 × 10-5 S cm-1 (0.46 eV); the almost monotonic decrease of ion bulk conductivity from x = 0.75 to x = 2 in this series is in line with Meyer-Neldel's compensation behavior showing that a decrease in Ea is accompanied by a decrease of the Arrhenius prefactor. Altogether, the system might serve as an attractive alternative to Al-stabilized (or Ga-stabilized) Li7La3Zr2O12 as LLHTO is also anticipated to be highly stable against Li metal.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1002/admi.202000450
The Electronic Conductivity of Single Crystalline Ga-Stabilized Cubic Li7La3Zr2O12: A Technologically Relevant Parameter for All-Solid-State Batteries,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe next-generation of all-solid-state lithium batteries need ceramic electrolytes with very high ionic conductivities. At the same time a negligible electronic conductivity σeon is required to eliminate self-discharge in such systems. A non-negligible electronic conductivity may also promote the unintentional formation of Li dendrites, being currently one of the key issues hindering the development of long-lasting all-solid-state batteries. This interplay is suggested recently for garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). It is, however, well known that the overall macroscopic electronic conductivity may be governed by a range of extrinsic factors such as impurities, chemical inhomogeneities, grain boundaries, morphology, and size effects. Here, advantage of Czochralski-grown single crystals, which offer the unique opportunity to evaluate intrinsic properties of a chemically homogeneous matrix, is taken to measure the electronic conductivity σeon. Via long-time, high-precision potentiostatic polarization experiments an upper limit of σeon in the order of 5 × 10−10 S cm−1 (293 K) is estimated. This value is by six orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding total conductivity σtotal = 10−3 S cm−1 of Ga-LLZO. Thus, it is concluded that the high values of σeon recently reported for similar systems do not necessarily mirror intragrain bulk properties of chemically homogenous systems but may originate from chemically inhomogeneous interfacial areas.",Advanced Materials Interfaces,10.1007/s11664-020-08221-8
Processing and Enhanced Electrochemical Properties of Li7La3Zr2−xTixO12 Solid Electrolyte by Chemical Co-precipitation,"© 2020, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.Garnet-like solid electrolyte ceramics, Li7La3Zr2−xTixO12 (LLZTO, x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3), were successfully synthesized at low temperature via chemical co-precipitation. The composition and phase transformation during the heating of the LLZTO precursors are analyzed using thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analysis and x-ray diffraction. The results indicated that 900°C was the likely activation point of LLZTO precursor powder crystallization and all the samples sintered at 1120°C formed a single phase with cubic garnet-like structure. The different morphologies of the LLZTO are characterized using scanning electron microscopy. As the content of Ti increased, the grain size increased to 20 μm, and few pores are observed on the grain boundaries. Additionally, Ti doping increased the ionic conductivity of LLZO ceramics: the sample with x = 0.1 reaches a maximum total ionic conductivity of 1.91 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 298 K and its activation energy is 0.33 eV, which may be a significant step towards the goal of an ultimate safe solid electrolyte of a solid-state lithium ion battery.",Journal of Electronic Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c00716
Reduction in Formation Temperature of Ta-Doped Lithium Lanthanum Zirconate by Application of Lux-Flood Basic Molten Salt Synthesis,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Garnets such as Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) are important Li+ conducting ceramics for potential use as solid electrolytes in solid-state batteries. However, LLZO is predominately prepared by using solid-state reaction methods, despite the high energy cost, multiple steps involved, and large particle sizes of the resultant material. Herein, molten salt synthesis (MSS) is applied to prepare Ta-doped LLZO (Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12, LLZTO), demonstrating that control over the Lux-Flood basicity of the molten salt medium enables drastic reduction in the formation temperature relative to other synthetic methods. Each of the reaction media investigated, including eutectic LiCl-KCl, a mixture of LiCl-LiOH, and highly basic ternary mixtures of LiNO3-LiOH-Li2O2, can be used to synthesize LLZTO under the appropriate experimental conditions. In the last case, garnet powders with predominately submicrometer particle sizes are obtained at temperatures as low as 550 °C. Sintered LLZTO pellets with high room temperature ionic conductivity can be obtained by using powders from each MSS method. LLZTO powders synthesized from the highly basic melts show good densification due to the small particle sizes (0.2-1 μm) and exhibit total ionic conductivity as high as 0.61 mS cm-1. The results show that molten salt synthesis in media with high Lux-Flood basicity is an attractive low-temperature synthetic approach to achieving highly conducting garnet electrolytes.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c01470
One-Step Processing of Soft Electrolyte/Metallic Lithium Interface for High-Performance Solid-State Lithium Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Cubic garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a remarkable Li-ion electrolyte for solid-state lithium metal batteries due to its high ion conductivity and perfect electrochemical stability against lithium metal anode. However, the application of LLZO is hindered by the poor interfacial contact between garnet and lithium metal. Herein, LLZO powder was sandwiched by graphite foils and densified by a one-step hot press process. After peeling off the graphite foils from the LLZO pellet, the residual thin layer of graphite (∼0.15 μm) can be easily lithiated in contact with lithium metal. This buffer layer not only greatly improves the wettability and interfacial contact between LLZO and lithium metal but also significantly relieves the volume expansion of lithium metal during cycling. The assembled symmetric cell cycled over 1500 h at 0.1 mA cm-2 with excellent stability. Moreover, the hybrid-state full cell also shows good electrochemical performance.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsami.0c08605
Establishing Ultralow Activation Energies for Lithium Transport in Garnet Electrolytes,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Garnet-type structured lithium ion conducting ceramics represent a promising alternative to liquid-based electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries. However, their performance is limited by their polycrystalline nature and inherent inhomogeneous current distribution due to different ion dynamics at grains, grain boundaries, and interfaces. In this study, we use a combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, distribution of relaxation time analysis, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), in order to understand the role that bulk, grain boundary, and interfacial processes play in the ionic transport and electrochemical performance of garnet-based cells. Variable temperature impedance analysis reveals the lowest activation energy for Li transport in the bulk of the garnet electrolyte (0.15 eV), consistent with pulsed field gradient NMR spectroscopy measurements (0.14 eV). We also show a decrease in grain boundary activation energy at temperatures below 0 °C, that is followed by the total conductivity, suggesting that the bottleneck to ionic transport resides in the grain boundaries. We reveal that the grain boundary activation energy is heavily affected by its composition that, in turn, is mainly affected by the segregation of dopants and Li. We suggest that by controlling the grain boundary composition, it would be possible to pave the way toward targeted engineering of garnet-type electrolytes and ameliorate their electrochemical performance in order to enable their use in commercial devices.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c04850
A Simple and Highly Efficient Method toward High-Density Garnet-Type LLZTO Solid-State Electrolyte,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is among the most attractive candidates for achieving solid-state lithium batteries. LLZO pellets with high density are preferred because of their potential to prevent dendritic Li growth and penetration. However, the presence of pores inside the LLZO electrolyte is inevitable if it is prepared by a traditional solid-state reaction. Large numbers of pores have an adverse influence on both the ionic conductivity and density of the LLZO pellets. In this work, we studied the origin of pore formation in Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) and introduced a fast oxygen-assisted sintering method to eliminate the pores. All of the basic physical properties of the LLZTO sintered in oxygen for only 1 h are better than those of the LLZTO sintered in air. The conductivity and Vickers hardness of the LLZTO increased to 6.13 × 10-4 S cm-1 and 9.82 GPa, corresponding to 12.3% and 62.8% enhancement, respectively, even at a low precalcined temperature of 600 °C.

Mapping hot-pressed Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) grains and grain boundaries through a simple thermal grooving technique,"© 2020 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group on behalf of The Korean Ceramic Society and The Ceramic Society of Japan.Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is one of the most promising solid-state electrolytes due to its electrochemical and chemical stability against metallic Li and high ionic conductivity at room temperature. Despite its favorable attributes, it has been shown that Li metal can penetrate LLZO above a critical current density (CCD). Currently, the mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs has not been completely elucidated. However, microstructural defects such as grain boundaries have been pointed out as one of the defects where Li metal preferentially propagates. Thus, microstructural characterization techniques that do not require extensive sample preparation are valuable to correlate processing conditions with resulting microstructure and properties. In this work, a thermal grooving process was optimized to minimize lithium loss allowing to visualize and study the microstructure of LLZO. The proposed technique does not require extensive sample preparation such as what is required for electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD). Variables such as temperature and atmosphere were tuned to optimize thermal grooving while maintaining phase purity (91.4 wt %). We believe this simple method to visualize grains and grain boundaries will help guide efforts to correlate processing conditions with electrolyte properties and ultimately move forward to enable solid-state battery technology.",Journal of Asian Ceramic Societies,10.1002/aenm.202000945
The Fast Charge Transfer Kinetics of the Lithium Metal Anode on the Garnet-Type Solid Electrolyte Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe charge transfer kinetics between a lithium metal electrode and an inorganic solid electrolyte is of key interest to assess the rate capability of future lithium metal solid state batteries. In an in situ microelectrode study run in a scanning electron microscope, it is demonstrated that—contrary to the prevailing opinion—the intrinsic charge transfer resistance of the Li|Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) interface is in the order of 10−1 Ω cm2 and thus negligibly small. The corresponding high exchange current density in combination with the single ion transport mechanism (t+ ≈ 1) of the inorganic solid electrolyte enables extremely fast plating kinetics without the occurrence of transport limitations. Local plating rates in the range of several A cm−2 are demonstrated at defect free and chemically clean Li|LLZO interfaces. Practically achievable current densities are limited by lateral growth of lithium along the surface as well as electro-chemo-mechanical-induced fracture of the solid electrolyte. In combination with the lithium vacancy diffusion limitation during electrodissolution, these morphological instabilities are identified as the key fundamental limitations of the lithium metal electrode for solid-state batteries with inorganic solid electrolytes.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.03.028

Effect of acid treatment of Li7La3Zr2O12on ionic conductivity of composite solid electrolytes,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The garnet-type metal oxide Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) is considered to be one of the most promising compounds for solid lithium ion batteries because of its high ionic conductivity at room temperature and excellent chemical stability with the metal Li. LLZO is unstable in humid air and easily forms Li2CO3 on the surface, which leads to the decrease of ion conductivity. In this paper, chemical treatment by oxalic acid is carried out to remove the lithium carbonate on the surface of LLZO. The results show that oxalic acid with a concentration ratio of 5% can completely remove lithium carbonate. Composite polymer electrolyte membranes fabricated by the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)and LLZO before and after the acid treatment are prepared to evaluate the effect on ionic conductivity.

Herein, we report the preparation and application of composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) based on a three-dimensional and interconnected Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet network in polyethylene oxide matrix (denoted as 3D-CPE) for LABs. The 3D-CPE achieves high electrochemical stability and ionic conductivity at room temperature, surpassing the conventional CPEs prepared by LLZO particles (denoted as C-CPE). The uniform macro-porous structure in LLZO network is conducive to accommodating PEO polymers and suppressing polymer crystallization. Furthermore, the integrated structure of 3D LLZO network can contribute the lithium ion conduction through LLZO bulk phases and along the continuous interfaces between PEO matrix and LLZO fillers.

We synthesized air-stable dual-doped Li6.05La3Ga0.3Zr1.95Nb0.05O12 ((Ga, Nb)-LLZO) cubic-phase garnets with ionic conductivity of 9.28 × 10-3 S cm-1. The impurity-phase species formation on the garnet pellets after air exposure was investigated. LiOH and Li2CO3 can be observed on the garnet pellets by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) once the garnets are exposed to humid air or come in contact with water. The (Ga, Nb)-LLZO garnet is found to form less LiOH and Li2CO3, which can be further reduced or removed after drying treatment. To confirm the stability of the garnet, an electrochemical test of the Li//Li symmetric cell was also performed in comparison with previously reported garnets (Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12, (Ca, Nb)-LLZO). The dual-doped (Ga, Nb)-LLZO showed less polarized and stable plating/stripping behavior than (Ca, Nb)-LLZO. Through Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns of prepared materials, dopant Ga was found to preferably occupy the Li site and Nb takes the Zr site, while dopant Ca mainly substituted La in the reference sample. The inherited properties of the dopants in (Ga, Nb)-LLZO and their structural synergy explain the greatly improved air stability and reduced interfacial resistance. This may open a new direction to realize garnet-based solid electrolytes with lower interfacial resistance and superior air stability.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.0c03519
Cathode Interface Compatibility of Amorphous LiMn2O4(LMO) and Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) Characterized with Thin-Film Solid-State Electrochemical Cells,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Solid-state lithium-ion batteries are a hopeful successor to traditional Li-ion cells that use liquid electrolytes. While a growing body of work has characterized the interfaces between various solid electrolytes and the lithium metal, interfaces with common cathode intercalation compounds are comparatively less understood. In this contribution, the influence of polarization and temperature on interfacial stability between LiMn2O4 (LMO) and Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) are investigated. Sputtered thin-film LMO electrodes are utilized to permit high-capacity cycling while retaining a large ratio of interfacial area to electrode bulk. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is compared across a set of full (LMO|LLZO|Li) and symmetric (LMO|LLZO|LMO, Li|LLZO|Li, and Au|LLZO|Au) cells to delineate impedance features that are specific to the evolution of the cathode interface. Additional X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provides evidence of a limited interfacial reaction between LMO and LLZO that coincides with an increase in the impedance of the LMO-LLZO interface.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1002/batt.201900173
Engineering of Sn and Pre-Lithiated Sn as Negative Electrode Materials Coupled to Garnet Ta-LLZO Solid Electrolyte for All-Solid-State Li Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAll-solid-state batteries using garnet-type solid electrolyte are considered as a promising solution for the next generation energy storage systems but to date they still suffer from low ionic conductivity compared to organic liquid electrolytes and poor interfacial contact between the electroactive materials and the electrolyte. Here we propose several proof-of-concept level strategies to enhance the interfacial contact between the electroactive material Sn and the solid electrolyte Ta-LLZO doped (hereafter called LLZTa) to enable proper electrochemical cycling. First, we demonstrate that the conventional slurry-based technique is not appropriate to ensure cycling of a Sn based electrode in all-solid-state batteries due to poor interfacial contact. Then, we demonstrate (proof-of-concept) that thin films deposition is a more suitable approach to ensure electrochemical activity but the large volume changes of Sn during alloying process is leading to a rapid cell failure. This last challenge was overcome by the use of a chemically pre-lithiated Sn thin film which then delivers, after an activation process, specific charge close to the theoretical one (900 mAh/g) at C/30 rate and T=80 °C.",Batteries and Supercaps,10.1007/s11581-020-03582-w
Effect of bottleneck size on lithium migration in lithium garnets Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO),"© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Molecular dynamic simulations were performed on element-screened Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)-equivalent doping system to reveal the effect of bottleneck (surface between the polyhedron of 24d and 96h site in cubic LLZO) size on lithium ion diffusion in this garnet-type solid electrolyte. The relationship between lithium ion diffusivity, lattice constant (volume), and bottleneck size were further studied. Herein, we found unneglectable discreteness between lattice constant (volume) and lithium ion diffusivity; beyond that, a quasi-linear relationship between bottleneck size and lithium ion diffusivity under high temperature (1000~1400 K) was unveiled. Our results show that by simply regulating the bottleneck size, the diffusion properties of lithium garnets can be further improved.",Ionics,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.170
An all-solid-state lithium battery using the Li7La3Zr2O12 and Li6.7La3Zr1.7Ta0.3O12 ceramic enhanced polyethylene oxide electrolytes with superior electrochemical performance,"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.As a core component of all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) have good safety, high ionic conductivity and certain flexibility. Here, we report that the CSEs is composed by mixing the Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and Li6.7La3Zr1.7Ta0.3O12 (LLZTO) ceramic filler, polyethylene oxide (PEO) and LiTFSI. The ionic conductivity of the optimized CSEs is as high as 1.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C, the electrochemical stability window is 5.4 V, and the lithium ion transference number is 0.5 at 60 °C. In addition, the uniform distribution of ceramic particles enhances the thermal stability, mechanical strength and the interfacial compatibility of the CSEs, which inhibits the growth of lithium dendrites. The assembled LiFePO4/PEO-LiTFSI-10 wt% Li6.7La3Zr1.7Ta0.3O12/Li battery exhibited excellent cycle and rate performance at 60 °C. The initial discharge capacity was 140 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 C, and the discharge capacity was maintained 139.4 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.106
Rapid sintering method for highly conductive Li7La3Zr2O12 ceramic electrolyte,"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Solid electrolytes could address the increasingly urgent safety and energy density concerns of lithium-ion batteries. Among several kinds of solid electrolytes, Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Ta-LLZO) became a research hotspot because of its high Li-ion conductivity and chemical stability against Li-metal and air. However, the preparation of high quality LLZO ceramic electrolyte via conventional air ambient sintering method is still a big challenge due to the serious “Li-loss” and abnormal grain growth phenomenon during the long-time high-temperature sintering process. Herein, a new rapid ultra-high-temperature air ambient sintering method without mother powder (MP) is put forward for the preparation of high quality Ta-LLZO ceramic electrolyte. The rapid sintering strategy can effectively restrain “Li-loss”. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the none-mother-powder method is superior to traditional mother-powder method. Ta-LLZO ceramics sintered without MP via this rapid sintering method own small grain size, tight grain boundary, dense microstructure and high conductivity. Specifically, the Ta-LLZO ceramic sintered at 1360 °C for 10 min without MP exhibits high conductivity (8.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C) and high relative density (97%), which equate those made by hot pressing sintering method. Without MP, the sintering process can avoid a lot of material waste and simplify the operation process. Moreover, the rapid sintering process can sharply shorten sintering time and reduce energy consumption. Therefore, this low-cost high-efficient sintering strategy can be effectively used in the large-scale production of high-quality Ta-LLZO ceramic electrolyte.",Ceramics International,10.1007/s11581-019-03436-0
Fabrication and electrochemical behavior of thin composite solid electrolyte for all-solid lithium batteries,"© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Loading level, active material content of the cathode, and the thickness of composite solid electrolyte (CSE) sheets were optimized as 13 mg cm−2, 88 wt%, and 60 μm, respectively, for the development of all-solid lithium batteries (ASLBs) with high energy density. Thin CSE sheets were fabricated by adding PVDF binder with Al-LLZO powder and PEO-Li salt solution. PVDF had effects on the ionic conductivity, strength, and electrochemical stability of the CSE sheet. When the PVDF content was increased to 7 wt%, CSE sheet strength increased from 1.4 to 2.83 MPa, while the electrochemical stability has significantly improved at the range of oxidation and reduction potential. However, the ionic conductivity decreased from 3.7 × 10−4 to 1.73 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 70 °C. Moreover, the surface layer of the composite cathode was smoother than that of normal composition, and the interfacial resistance between the cathode compound layer and Al current collector has also decreased by adding PVDF. As a result of the test, the initial discharge capacity of the coin cell showed 207 mAh g−1 and 2.3 mAh cm−2 at 70 °C.",Ionics,10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00427
"Garnet-Type Solid-State Electrolytes: Materials, Interfaces, and Batteries","© 2020 American Chemical Society.Solid-state batteries with desirable advantages, including high-energy density, wide temperature tolerance, and fewer safety-concerns, have been considered as a promising energy storage technology to replace organic liquid electrolyte-dominated Li-ion batteries. Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) as the most critical component in solid-state batteries largely lead the future battery development. Among different types of solid-state electrolytes, garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid-state electrolytes have particularly high ionic conductivity (10-3 to 10-4 S/cm) and good chemical stability against Li metal, offering a great opportunity for solid-state Li-metal batteries. Since the discovery of garnet-type LLZO in 2007, there has been an increasing interest in the development of garnet-type solid-state electrolytes and all solid-state batteries. Garnet-type electrolyte has been considered one of the most promising and important solid-state electrolytes for batteries with potential benefits in energy density, electrochemical stability, high temperature stability, and safety. In this Review, we will survey recent development of garnet-type LLZO electrolytes with discussions of experimental studies and theoretical results in parallel, LLZO electrolyte synthesis strategies and modifications, stability of garnet solid electrolytes/electrodes, emerging nanostructure designs, degradation mechanisms and mitigations, and battery architectures and integrations. We will also provide a target-oriented research overview of garnet-type LLZO electrolyte and its application in various types of solid-state battery concepts (e.g., Li-ion, Li-S, and Li-air), and we will show opportunities and perspectives as guides for future development of solid electrolytes and solid-state batteries.",Chemical Reviews,10.1021/acsaem.0c00347
Microstructural and Electrochemical Properties of Al- And Ga-Doped Li7La3Zr2O12 Garnet Solid Electrolytes,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.The Garnet-type solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) showing high ionic conductivity and a wide electrochemical potential window is considered as one of the most promising candidates for solid-state batteries. Among various doping derivatives, the Al- and Ga-doped LLZO electrolytes are intensively studied because of their ability to enhance the stability of the cubic structure and to promote good sinter ability as well. Despite showing great similarities in site preference and sintering behavior, the Al and Ga doping derivatives differ by 1 order of magnitude in total ionic conductivity. Therefore, a comparative study on the doping characteristics of Al and Ga with respect to ionic conductivity and sintering behavior is necessary. Herein, we simultaneously introduced Al and Ga into Li sites (AlxGa0.25-x-LLZO) to study their influences on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of LLZO. The results show that Ga doping enables a higher conductivity than Al doping and largely promotes sinter ability at the same time. Compared to Al single doping (Al0.25), Ga-contained compositions (x < 0.25) show significant grain growth. Moreover, a slight inclusion of Ga (Al0.20Ga0.05) not only modifies the sintering behavior that results in a microstructure transition from fine grains of Al0.25 (5-20 μm) to abnormally large grains (several hundred micrometers) but also greatly enhances the conductivity, yielding a value that is 3 times higher. However, further increases in Ga ratio in AlxGa0.25-x results in marginal increases in conductivity. The total conductivity reaches a maximum of 1.19 × 10-3 S cm-1 for Ga single doping (Ga0.25) at room temperature. In addition, Al0.25 also shows fast ion conducting behavior along the grain boundaries with a conductivity of 8.30 × 10-4 S cm-1. Consequently, this study sheds lights on the different doping characteristics between Al and Ga, providing guidance for fine composition engineering of these two promising dopants.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsami.0c06194
Effect of Liquid Electrolyte Soaking on the Interfacial Resistance of Li7La3Zr2O12 for All-Solid-State Lithium Batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.The impact of liquid electrolyte soaking on the interfacial resistance between the garnet-structured Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte and metallic lithium has been studied. Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) formed by inadvertent exposure of LLZO to ambient conditions is generally known to increase interfacial impedance and decrease lithium wettability. Soaking LLZO powders and pellets in the electrolyte containing lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF4) shows a significantly reduced interfacial resistance and improved contact between lithium and LLZO. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal how Li2CO3 is continuously removed with increasing soaking time. On-line mass spectrometry and free energy calculations show how LiBF4 reacts with surface carbonate to form carbon dioxide. Using a very simple and scalable process that does not involve heat-treatment and expensive coating techniques, we show that the Li-LLZO interfacial resistance can be reduced by an order of magnitude.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1039/d0ja00051e
Spatially resolved stoichiometry determination of Li7La3Zr2O12 solid-state electrolytes using LA-ICP-OES,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnets are among the most promising solid-state electrolytes for next-generation Li batteries. However, despite intensive research in recent years, little effort is spent on proper chemical analysis of the material. For reliable LLZO investigation, knowledge about the exact chemical composition, especially the Li content, is of uttermost importance. Herein, we present a method for the laterally resolved stoichiometry determination of Al stabilized LLZO (Li7-3xAlxLa3Zr2O12) using LA-ICP-OES. To ensure reliable signal quantification, matrix-matched standards are prepared and carefully characterized using sample digestion and liquid ICP-OES measurement. An internal standard-independent calibration strategy based on 100 m% normalization is applied, enabling the quantification of all cations within the material. By comparing the obtained high-precision LA-ICP-OES calibrations with analog LA-ICP-MS measurements, it is shown that ICP-OES is the superior choice for the analysis of Li. The developed method is applied to record quantitative distribution images of an Al stabilized LLZO pellet, revealing macroscopic stoichiometry variations within the sample. To verify the analysis, the average stoichiometry obtained by the LA measurements is compared with the bulk composition determined via liquid ICP-OES analysis after sample fusion. The obtained values show excellent agreement, confirming the accuracy of the developed method.",Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104625
In situ atomic scale investigation of Li7La3Zr2O12-based Li+-conducting solid electrolyte during calcination growth,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdThe development of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) is crucial for realizing next-generation high-energy-density and high-safety lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The chemical composition design and synthesis route are known to be the determining factors for SSE properties. One of the most promising SSEs for LIB applications is garnet-type Li+-conducting oxide synthesized via a solid-state reaction. This study performs an in situ TEM investigation of Li6.25Ga0.25La3Zr2O12 (Ga-LLZO) growth during a high-temperature calcination process. At 750 °C, an intermediate phase, La2Zr2O7 (LZO), is formed through epitaxial growth along the crystallographic orientations of (1‾11)LZO//(1‾11)ZrO2 and [211]LZO//[101]ZrO2. The incorporation of Li and Ga into LZO is found to occur at 900 °C. The LZO transforms into Ga-LLZO via a layer-by-layer diffusion process that takes place along the [011‾] direction. The Ga doping can stabilize the cubic structure of Ga-LLZO at a temperature of 900 °C (while a temperature of >1100 °C is needed to obtain cubic LLZO) and eliminate the formation of the unwanted tetragonal phase. This dynamic microstructure evolution of Ga-LLZO is examined at an atomic scale for the first time. This study opens up a new route to better characterize and understand SSE materials, providing opportunities for further tailoring SSE properties.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104633
Li7La3Zr2O12 sheet-based framework for high-performance lithium–sulfur hybrid quasi-solid battery,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdApplications of lithium batteries are challenged by their unsatisfactory safety profiles. Solid-state batteries present a very promising solution to overcome the safety issues, but their performance requires major improvement. Hybrid quasi-solid electrolyte (HQSE), comprising solid and liquid components, has emerged as a practical compromise for safer and high-performance Li batteries. Li–S system is one of the most promising Li battery candidates; however, the performance of Li–S hybrid quasi-solid battery still needs to be further enhanced. Herein, a new HQSE design comprising Li7La3Zr2O12 sheet-based solid framework imbibed with liquid electrolyte is applied to Li–S battery. The liquid-infused 3D architecture allows fast Li ion mobility and low interfacial resistance. It is also compatible with Li metal, highly processable, unleakable, and thermally stable. These attributes result in a high-performance Li–S hybrid quasi-solid system with a very good safety profile. The novel HQSE design also demonstrates improved anodic stability, which is very promising for high-voltage cathodes. The excellent performance, enhanced safety, and broad applicability of our sheet-based LLZO HQSE set the path for applications in other types of Li batteries to achieve both safe and high-performance energy storage systems.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2019.12.054
"Correlating the effect of dopant type (Al, Ga, Ta) on the mechanical and electrical properties of hot-pressed Li-garnet electrolyte","© 2019 Elsevier LtdThe effect of cubic-phase stabilizing dopant (Al, Ga, Ta) on the mechanical and electrochemical properties of Li garnet solid electrolyte was studied. Dense Li6.25La3Al0.25Zr2O12, Li6.50La3Ta0.50Zr1.5O12, Li6.25La3Ga0.25Zr2O12 were prepared by conventional solid-state synthesis of powder and densified using hot pressing. Ga-LLZO exhibited the highest fracture stress (∼143 MPa), fracture toughness (∼1.22 MPa m1/2) and total conductivity (∼1 mS/cm) of the three materials; however, the bulk conductivity was about 1.5 mS/cm. We believe that the weak grain-boundaries, as evidenced by a predominately intergranular fracture, correlates with a relatively high grain-boundary impedance, thus reducing the value of the total conductivity by about 30 % lower than that for the bulk. Based on the combined mechanical and electrical properties, overall, Li6.25La3Ga0.25Zr2O12 exhibits the most favorable combination of some of the most salient properties of the three dopants. We believe the results of this study will facilitate the commercialization of Li metal batteries using Li-garnet ceramic electrolyte.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227989
Dendrites as climbing dislocations in ceramic electrolytes: Initiation of growth,© 2020 Elsevier B.V.We idealise dendrite growth in a ceramic electrolyte by climb of a thick edge dislocation. Growth of the dendrite occurs at constant chemical potential of Li+ at the dendrite tip: the free-energy to fracture and wedge open the electrolyte is provided by the flux of Li+ from the electrolyte into the dendrite tip. This free-energy is dependent on the Li+ overpotential at the dendrite tip and is thereby related to the imposed charging current density. The predicted critical current density agrees with measurements for Li/LLZO/Li symmetric cells: the critical current density decreases with increasing initial length of the dendrite and with increasing electrode/electrolyte interfacial ionic resistance. The simulations also reveal that a void on the cathode/electrolyte interface locally enhances the Li+ overpotential and significantly reduces the critical current density for the initiation of dendrite growth.,Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.145399
Microstructure evolution and transport properties of garnet-type Li6.5La2.5Ba0.5TaZrO12 electrolyte for all-solid-state Li-ion batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.The garnet-type Li6.5La2.5Ba0.5TaZrO12 (LLBTZO) electrolyte for Li-ion battery was synthesized by doping tantalum (Ta) and barium (Ba) in Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) via solid-state method at different sintering temperatures (1100, 1150 and 1200 °C). The as-prepared sintered compositions were characterized for their physical properties using X-ray diffraction (XRD) which confirmed the formation of desired cubic phase of LLBTZO. The material was further investigated by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and He-pycnometer to study morphological and electrochemical properties. Increasing the sintering temperature from 1100 to 1200 °C led to more than 60-fold increase in the ionic conductivity at 26 °C from 1.07 × 10−6 to 6.62 × 10−5 S/cm, which can be attributed to evolution of microstructures. With increasing sintering temperature, more of the powder surface is eliminated, the density of the resulting pellet was increased, and thus the total conductivity was enhanced.",Applied Surface Science,10.1021/acsaem.9b02401
Discovering the Influence of Lithium Loss on Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12Electrolyte Phase Stability,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Garnet-type lithium lanthanum zirconate (Li7La3Zr2O12, LLZO)-based ceramic electrolyte has potential for further development of all-solid-state energy storage technologies including Li metal batteries as well as Li-S and Li-O2 chemistries. The essential prerequisites such as LLZO's compactness, stability, and ionic conductivity for this development are nearly achievable via the solid-state reaction route (SSR) at high temperatures, but it involves a trade-off between LLZO's caveats because of Li loss via volatilization. For example, SSR between lithium carbonate, lanthanum oxide, and zirconium oxide is typically supplemented by dopants (e.g., gallium or aluminum) to yield the stabilized cubic phase (c-LLZO) that is characterized by ionic conductivity an order of magnitude higher than the other polymorphs of LLZO. While the addition of dopants as phase stabilizing agent and supplying extra Li precursor for compensating Li loss at high temperatures become common practice in the solid-state process of LLZO, the exact role of dopants and stabilization pathway is still poorly understood, which leads to several manufacturing issues. By following LLZO's chemical phase evolution in relation to Li loss at high temperatures, we here show that stabilized c-LLZO can directly be achieved by an in situ control of lithium loss during SSR and without needing dopants. In light of this, we demonstrate that dopants in the conventional SSR route also play a similar role, i.e., making more accessible Li to the formation and phase stabilization of c-LLZO, as revealed by our in situ X-ray diffraction analysis. Further microscopic (STEM, EDXS, and EELS) analysis of the samples obtained under various SSR conditions provides insights into LLZO phase behavior. Our study can contribute to the development of more reliable solid-state manufacturing routes to Garnet-type ceramic electrolytes in preferred polymorphs exhibiting high ionic conductivity and stability for all-solid-state energy storage.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acsami.9b23019
Surface-Dependent Stability of the Interface between Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 and the Li Metal in the All-Solid-State Battery from First-Principles Calculations,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.The garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte is of particular interest because of its good chemical stability under atmospheric condition, suitable for practical all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). However, recent works observed electrochemical instability at the LLZO/Li interfaces. Herein, we have revealed the origin of the instability by performing a comprehensive first-principles investigation with a high-throughput interface structure search scheme, based on the density functional theory framework. Based on the constructed phase diagrams of low-index surfaces, we found that the coordinatively unsaturated (i.e. coordination number < 6) Zr sites exist widely on the low-energy LLZO surfaces. These undercoordinated Zr sites are reduced once the LLZO surface is in contact with the Li metal, leading to chemical instability of the LLZO/Li interface. Besides, the calculated formation and adhesion energies of interfaces suggest that the Li wettability on the LLZO surface is dependent on the termination structure. The employment of the approaches such as by controlling the synthesis atmosphere are needed for preventing the reduction of LLZO against the Li metal. The present analysis with comprehensive first-principles calculations provides a novel perspective for the rational optimization of the interface between LLZO electrolyte and Li metal anode in the ASSB.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1149/09707.0267ecst
Improving Interfacial Contact within Solid-State Lithium Batteries using the Composite Materials at the Cathode Produced by a Scalable Mechanofusion Process,"© 2020 ECS - The Electrochemical Society.Even though PEO-based electrolytes have been interested as a solution for developing the next-generation lithium-based batteries, their performances are still far from the commercial need and requirement. One of the major challenges limiting the cycling performance of all-solid-state batteries is at the interfacial contact of the electrode and the ceramic electrolyte, not like in the case of liquid electrolyte. To address this poor solid-solid contact, we introduce a cathode composite concept by combining both ceramic filler and polymer with LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode material. Herein, the garnet (Li7La3Zr2O12, LLZO) ceramic is well mixed with LFP cathode material using a new solid-solid mixing process namely a mechano-fusion technique. PEO is also used as a binder during the cathode preparation. The PEO-based composited electrolyte layer (filled with LLZO) and the composite material used at the cathode are stacked layer-by-layer and hot-pressed. As a result, this composite concept produced by a scalable mechanofusion process could be useful for further develop high-performance the all-solid-state batteries.",ECS Transactions,10.1039/c9se01162e
Realizing Li7La3Zr2O12 garnets with high Li+ conductivity and dense microstructures by Ga/Nb dual substitution for lithium solid-state battery applications,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.Li7La3Zr2.0O12 (LLZO) garnets have many properties of a suitable solid electrolyte for lithium ion batteries; however, drawbacks like their low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial properties still hinder their broadened application. Current research has sought to both increase their ionic conductivity and density their microstructure, which are two important factors relating to their practical application. This study presents a facile and effective way to obtain compact LLZO with high Li+ conductivity via a one-step multi-elemental doping strategy, using Nb5+ and Ga3+ as dopants simultaneously. Garnet-structured oxides with the nominal chemical composition of Li6.8-3xGaxLa3Zr1.8Nb0.2O12 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.3) are prepared via a conventional solid-state reaction, and the effects of the two dopants on the oxides are investigated based on the phase compositions, morphologies and Li ion conductivities. Benefitting from Li+ vacancies generated by the addition of the two elements, garnets sintered with an optimized amount of Ga/Nb dopant can exhibit relative densities of 93-95% and a peak conductivity of 1.42 × 10-3 S cm-1 at 50 °C. In a symmetric Li/LLZO/Li cell, this dense structured electrolyte shows a low overpotential and superior electrochemical stability to Li metal, exhibiting good performance for over 200 h at a current density of 100 μA cm-1 during Li plating/stripping cycles. Also, this co-doped solid-state electrolyte can exhibit acceptable cycling stability when paired with a LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 (NMC111) cathode, both with the help of liquid electrolyte and when assembled as an all-solid-state battery. We believe this research can provide some new insights into developing solid-state electrolyte-based lithium ion batteries.",Sustainable Energy and Fuels,10.1002/smll.202000279
Overcoming the Interfacial Limitations Imposed by the Solid–Solid Interface in Solid-State Batteries Using Ionic Liquid-Based Interlayers,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLi-garnets are promising inorganic ceramic solid electrolytes for lithium metal batteries, showing good electrochemical stability with Li anode. However, their brittle and stiff nature restricts their intimate contact with both the electrodes, hence presenting high interfacial resistance to the ionic mobility. To address this issue, a strategy employing ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) thin interlayers at the electrodes/electrolyte interfaces is adopted, which helps overcome the barrier for ion transport. The chemically stable ILE improves the electrodes-solid electrolyte contact, significantly reducing the interfacial resistance at both the positive and negative electrodes interfaces. This results in the more homogeneous deposition of metallic lithium at the negative electrode, suppressing the dendrite growth across the solid electrolyte even at high current densities of 0.3 mA cm−2. Further, the improved interface Li/electrolyte interface results in decreasing the overpotential of symmetric Li/Li cells from 1.35 to 0.35 V. The ILE modified Li/LLZO/LFP cells stacked either in monopolar or bipolar configurations show excellent electrochemical performance. In particular, the bipolar cell operates at a high voltage (≈8 V) and delivers specific capacity as high as 145 mAh g−1 with a coulombic efficiency greater than 99%.",Small,10.1016/j.ssi.2020.115227
Ultrathin Li7La3Zr2O12@PAN composite polymer electrolyte with high conductivity for all-solid-state lithium-ion battery,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Composite polymer electrolyte is promising in future lithium-ion battery due to its high safety, easy-processing feature and electrochemical stability. However, it is still a great challenge to obtain the electrolyte with both low thickness and high conductivity. In this work, we synthesize a ~25 μm thin electrolyte membrane with the Li7La3Zr2O12-embedded polyacrylonitrile-based fiber as the 3D backbone and the in-situ polymerized gel electrolyte as the fillers. The electrolyte with the multi-dimensional lithium ion conducting channels exhibits a high conductivity of 1.60 × 10− 3 S·cm− 1 at 25 °C. The wide electrochemical window of 4.5 V vs. Li/Li+ enables the electrolyte to match with high voltage cathode materials.

"Garnet Si–Li7La3Zr2O12 electrolyte with a durable, low resistance interface layer for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries","© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Solid garnet electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) based Li metal batteries is a promising candidate for the next generation high energy device due to the advantages of electrochemical stability and relative high ionic conductivity at room temperature (10−4 S cm−1). Here, a series of xSi-LLZO electrolytes are prepared by the traditional solid state sintering. The 0.15 Si-LLZO result shows the maximum Li ionic conductivity (6.68 × 10−4 S cm−1, 25 °C) and minimum electronic conductivity (4.41 × 10−8 S cm−1, 25 °C), meanwhile tactfully formes LLZO@LiAlSi2O6 (LLZO@LAS) electrolyte in this process. The hard-to-hard poor contact, resulting in a very large interfacial resistance and low Coulombic efficiency in Li metal bettries. Herein, we demonstrate a simple and effective to overcome the interfacial obstacles by introducing polymer poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolyte thin buffer layer to modify the bare garnet electrolyte, forming a P-0.15 Si-LLZO-P composite electrolyte. The integrated NCM811/P-0.15 Si-LLZO-P/Li and LFP/P-0.15 Si-LLZO-P/Li batteries show a high Coulombic efficiency of around 99.0% and 98.5% at 50 °C, respectively. Meanwhile, P-0.15 Si-LLZO-P composite electrolyte stays intact after cycling.

Thickness-Dependent Beneficial Effect of the ZnO Layer on Tailoring the Li/Li7La3Zr2O12 Interface,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)-based ceramics are well-known as the most promising solid electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. However, its practical application has been significantly hindered by high Li/LLZO interfacial impedance as a result of poor interfacial contact. To solve these issues, in this work, the ZnO layer was magnetron sputter-deposited on Li6.55La2.95Ca0.05Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLCZTO) pellets. It was found that by introducing a 200 nm thick ZnO layer, the interfacial area specific resistance was sharply reduced to as low as 1% that of pristine LLCZTO; meanwhile, Li plating/stripping performance was improved significantly with a long life span of 320 h and a low polarization potential of 0.1 V, whereas a thicker ZnO layer of 600 nm can only improve the interface contact to a very limited extent because of the accumulated volume expansion induced by the in situ transformation of ZnO to the Li-Zn alloy, demonstrating the thickness-dependent beneficial effect of the ZnO layer on improving the Li/LLCZTO interfacial contact and therefore reducing the interfacial resistance. Accordingly, the evolution of the interfacial contact mode and the Li+ migration mechanism during the Li plating/stripping process without or with ZnO layers of different thicknesses were discussed in detail.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.9b21251
Ceramic-Based Flexible Sheet Electrolyte for Li Batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.The increasing demand for high-energy-density batteries stimulated the revival of research interest in Li-metal batteries. The garnet-type ceramic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is one of the few solid-state fast-ion conductors that are stable against Li metal. However, the densification of LLZO powders usually requires high sintering temperatures (e.g., 1200 °C), which likely result in Li loss and various side reactions. From an engineering point of view, high-temperature sintering of thin LLZO electrolytes (brittle) at a large scale is difficult. Moreover, the high interfacial resistance between the solid LLZO electrolytes and electrodes is a notorious problem. Here, we report a practical synthesis of a flexible composite Al-doped LLZO (Al-LLZO) sheet electrolyte (75 μm in thickness), which can be mass-produced at room temperature. This ceramic-based flexible sheet electrolyte enables Li-metal batteries to operate at both 60 and 30 °C, demonstrating its potential application for developing practical Li-metal batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1063/1.5141764
Bi aliovalent substitution in Li7La3Zr2O12 garnets: Structural and ionic conductivity effects,"© 2020 Author(s).We report on the synthesis of cubic-phase garnet-type solid-state electrolytes based on Bi-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). Bi aliovalent substitution of Zr in LLZO utilizing the Pechini processing method is employed to synthesize Li7-xLa3Zr2-xBixO12 compounds. A strong dependence of the ionic conductivity on Bi content is observed, and under our synthesis and sintering conditions, a >100-fold increase over the un-doped sample is observed for x=0.75. Cubic-phase Li6La3Zr1BiO12 compounds are generated upon annealing in air in the temperature range 650 °C-900 °C. In contrast, in the absence of Bi, the cubic garnet phase of Li7La3Zr2O12 is not formed below 700 °C and a transformation to the tetragonal phase is observed at ∼900 °C for this un-doped compound. The role of Bi in lowering the formation temperature of the garnet cubic phase and in the ionic conductivity improvements is investigated in this work. We ascribe the effect of Bi-doping on ionic conductivity increments to changes in Li+-site occupancy and lattice parameters and the reduction in the formation temperature for the cubic-phase formation to rate enhancements of the solid-state reaction. To identify the site occupancy of Bi in the garnet structure, we employ synchrotron extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. Our results indicate that Bi additions occupy the Zr-type sites exclusively, to within the accuracy of the measurements.",AIP Advances,10.1016/j.mtla.2020.100607
Effect of lattice and dopant–induced strain on the conductivity of solid electrolytes: application of the elastic dipole method,"© 2020 Acta Materialia Inc.Here, we studied the possibility of applying the elastic dipole method (EDM) to predict the response of defect formation and migration energy to an external strain field (ϵij) in Al-doped cubic Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (Al-LLZO) and Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS). It is shown that EDM can quantitatively provide accurate values for Li-defect formation energy as a function of ϵij. EDM can also predict, qualitatively, how the migration barrier varies with ϵij. In both Al-LLZO and LGPS systems, the formation energy of Li+ vacancy decreases (increases) by applying a tensile (compressive) strain, which is because the lattice parameters tend to expand by formation of a Li+ vacancy. An opposite behavior is found for the formation energy of interstitial Li+. Furthermore, we found that a compressive strain decreases the diffusion barrier in Al-LLZO, while it increases it in LGPS. The lowering of migration barrier in Al-LLZO is in spite of contraction of bottleneck width of Li diffusion in this system. This finding is in line with a recent experimental study. Analysis of EDM results shows that the lowering (rising) in the migration barrier of Li in Al-LLZO (LGPS) under a compressive strain is due to tendency of the system to contract (expand) Li–O (Li–S) bond lengths in the transition states where Li ions are at the bottlenecks of diffusion pathways. We finally show that the result of Li migration barrier as a function of strain in a non-doped solid electrolyte can be used to predict the global effect of substitution/doping on the conductivity of that system.",Materialia,10.1002/aenm.201903993
The Role of Interlayer Chemistry in Li-Metal Growth through a Garnet-Type Solid Electrolyte,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSecuring the chemical and physical stabilities of electrode/solid-electrolyte interfaces is crucial for the use of solid electrolytes in all-solid-state batteries. Directly probing these interfaces during electrochemical reactions would significantly enrich the mechanistic understanding and inspire potential solutions for their regulation. Herein, the electrochemistry of the lithium/Li7La3Zr2O12-electrolyte interface is elucidated by probing lithium deposition through the electrolyte in an anode-free solid-state battery in real time. Lithium plating is strongly affected by the geometry of the garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) surface, where nonuniform/filamentary growth is triggered particularly at morphological defects. More importantly, lithium-growth behavior significantly changes when the LLZO surface is modified with an artificial interlayer to produce regulated lithium depositions. It is shown that lithium-growth kinetics critically depend on the nature of the interlayer species, leading to distinct lithium-deposition morphologies. Subsequently, the dynamic role of the interlayer in battery operation is discussed as a buffer and seed layer for lithium redistribution and precipitation, respectively, in tailoring lithium deposition. These findings broaden the understanding of the electrochemical lithium-plating process at the solid-electrolyte/lithium interface, highlight the importance of exploring various interlayers as a new avenue for regulating the lithium-metal anode, and also offer insight into the nature of lithium growth in anode-free solid-state batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1007/s11581-019-03320-x
A promising composite solid electrolyte incorporating LLZO into PEO/PVDF matrix for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries,"© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Solid electrolytes should be sought to exhibit high conductivity, good thermostability, and excellent mechanical properties for realizing excellent performance of lithium-ion batteries. In this study, we optimize the composition of poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PEO/PVDF) matrix and introduce Li6.2Ga0.1La3Zr1.5Bi0.5O12 (LLZO) ceramic powders into the matrix to form novel composite solid electrolytes. The PEO/PVDF blend matrix shows a low melting point and crystallinity and a high thermostability when the weight ratio of PEO and PVDF is 7:3. The electrolyte consisting of this PEO/PVDF blend matrix and 10 wt% LLZO shows the maximum conductivity (4.2 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C). In addition, all-solid-state LiFePO4||Li battery assembled with this solid electrolyte shows good cycling stability, which retained 96.5% of the maximum capacity after 100 cycles, and columbic efficiency (close to 100%) at 60 °C. The Li||Li symmetric battery assembled with the solid electrolyte can be steadily cycled for more than 300 h at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 at 60 °C. Hence, the new as-synthesized solid electrolyte should be a promising electrolyte for high performance of all-solid-state batteries.",Ionics,10.1016/j.ensm.2019.09.023
Safe LAGP-based all solid-state Li metal batteries with plastic super-conductive interlayer enabled by in-situ solidification,"© 2019Safe and high-energy-density all solid-state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are great in demand for future electrical vehicle and grid energy storage. The compatibility of electrode-electrolyte interface is a critical factor influencing the electrochemical performance of ASSLMBs. Herein, we propose a plastic super-conductive carrier to deter untoward reaction between Li anode and Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) electrolyte by in-situ solidifying succinonitrile-based plastic interlayer with Li6.4La3Zr2Al0.24O12 (LLZAO) nanowires (l-SN). The method of in-situ solidification promises the low interfacial resistance. The l-SN interlayer can not only act as a physical obstacle to isolate LAGP pellet from Li metal, but also provide three-dimensional ion channels to regulate the transfer of Li ions, delivering an uniform Li ion distribution for dendrite-free Li deposition. The Li|l-SN|LAGP|l-SN|Li symmetric cell can stably cycle for 240 h without short circuit at room temperature (R.T). This approach enables a high specific capacity of 152.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1C for Li|l-SN|LAGP|l-SN|LiFePO4 cells at R.T. Furthermore, the integrated ASSLMBs show excellent cyclic stability at 40 °C with an initial discharge capacity of 168.4 mAh g−1 at 0.5C and retention of 93.17% after 100 cycles. The super-ionic property at the interface makes excellent rate performance of ASSLMBs at 40 °C. This strategy is facile and efficient in promising safe and outstanding ASSLMBs and also has some referential values for other unstable electrolyte interface beyond LAGP.",Energy Storage Materials,10.11896/cldb.19010029

All right reserved.Ba and Ga co-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), a garnet-type lithium ion solid-state electrolyte was prepared by a two-step approach: synthesis of LLZO powers by conventional solid-state reaction and sintering in the atmosphere. Then, the crystal structure, microstructure, composition distribution and ionic conductivity were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectrometer and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It was found that the cubic phase LLZO could be obtained under the sintering temperature of 1 100℃. When the content of Ga in LLZO was 0.15, and the doping amount of Ba altered from 0 to 0.15 (Ga0.15Bax-Li6.55+xLa3-xZr2O12, x=0-0.15), the LLZO sample exhibited a drop in the average grain size from 14 μm to 4 μm and a rise in the grain boundary conductivity (30℃) from 1.54×10-5 S•cm-1 to 2.22×10-4 S•cm-1. As a kind of sintering agent, the Ba played an critical role in improving the sintering performance, reducing the average grain size, and promoting the bonding between grains in the LLZO samples.

In situ thermally polymerized solid composite electrolytes with a broad electrochemical window for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.Solid composite electrolytes are prepared by polymerizing a liquid precursor containing Li6.25Ga0.25La3Zr2O12 (Ga-LLZO) nanoparticles. The composite electrolyte shows an ionic conductivity of 1.8 × 10-4 S cm-1 and a Li-ion transference number of 0.58 at 30 °C. Moreover, polymerized composite electrolytes (PCEs) are electrochemically stable up to 6.5 V versus Li/Li+ at room temperature.

"Synthesis of mixed ionic and electronic conducting garnet with doping of transition elements (Fe, Co, Ni)","© 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Garnet structure electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) exhibits high ionic conductivity, high fracture toughness, and low strain during cycling. The mechanical stability of cathodes could be improved by an LLZO coating. Nevertheless, the electronic conductivity of LLZO is in the order of 10−9 S cm−1, and therefore the electron conduction of cathodes is blocked by the LLZO coating layer. The electronic conductivity is raised by doping variable valence elements (Fe, Co, Ni) into garnets. The doping has only a weak effect on the ionic conductivity, while the electronic conductivity is increased to 10−6 S cm−1. Co-doped sample exhibits the highest electronic conductivity of 2.75 × 10−6 S cm−1.

The effect of water vapor on structure and electrochemical performance of an aluminum-free niobium-doped garnet electrolyte,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.In this work, we investigated how the substitution of Nb in the well-established Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) affects its structure and electrochemical performance. The Nb-doped solid-state electrolytes Li7-xLa3Zr2-xNbxO12 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0) were synthesized in zirconia crucibles instead of alumina, in order to eliminate the adverse influence of alumina. The stabilization of the cubic structure of the lithium garnet has been confirmed. The sintered density and ionic conductivity of the Nb-doped LLZO garnets (designated LLZNO) first increase until the Nb content reaches x = 0.5, beyond which these values decrease. We also found that exposing the synthesized garnets in humid air deteriorates ionic conductivity. The degrading mechanism relating to the exposure of the garnets is also discussed. In addition, the cycling stability of the LLZNO (x = 0.5) was assessed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge/discharge cycling testing.",Ceramics International,10.1021/jacs.9b12685
"Al/Ga-Doped Li7La3Zr2O12 Garnets as Li-Ion Solid-State Battery Electrolytes: Atomistic Insights into Local Coordination Environments and Their Influence on 17O, 27Al, and 71Ga NMR Spectra","© 2020 American Chemical Society.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnets are among the most promising solid electrolytes for next-generation all-solid-state Li-ion battery applications due to their high stabilities and ionic conductivities. To help determine the influence of different supervalent dopants on the crystal structure and site preferences, we combine solid-state 17O, 27Al, and 71Ga magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT-based defect configuration analysis for the undoped and Al and/or Ga-doped LLZO variants uncovers an interplay between the local network of atoms and the observed NMR signals. Specifically, the two characteristic features observed in both 27Al and 71Ga NMR spectra result from both the deviations in the polyhedral coordination/site-symmetry within the 4-fold coordinated Li1/24d sites (rather than the doping of the other Li2/96h or La sites) and with the number of occupied adjacent Li2 sites that share oxygen atoms with these dopant sites. The sharp 27Al and 71Ga resonances arise from dopants located at a highly symmetric tetrahedral 24d site with four corner-sharing LiO4 neighbors, whereas the broader features originate from highly distorted dopant sites with fewer or no immediate LiO4 neighbors. A correlation between the size of the 27Al/71Ga quadrupolar coupling and the distortion of the doping sites (viz. XO4/XO5/XO6 with X = {Al/Ga}) is established. 17O MAS NMR spectra for these systems provide insights into the oxygen connectivity network: 17O signals originating from the dopant-coordinating oxygens are resolved and used for further characterization of the microenvironments at the dopant and other sites.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1002/pol.20190095

Our results show that the overall crystallinity is positively correlated with the surface area of LLZO particles. The primary and secondary crystallization processes are identified by a modified Avrami equation, while two dynamic modes, the α relaxation and α′ relaxation, were in the DRS measurements.

Submicron-sized Nb-doped lithium garnet for high ionic conductivity solid electrolyte and performance of quasi-solid-state lithium battery,"© 2020 by the authors.The garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has been widely investigated because of its high conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and chemical stability with regards to lithium metal. However, the usual preparation process of LLZO requires high-temperature sintering for a long time and a lot of mother powder to compensate for lithium evaporation. In this study submicron Li6.6La3Zr1.6Nb0.4O12 (LLZNO) powder-which has a stable cubic phase and high sintering activity-was prepared using the conventional solid-state reaction and the attrition milling process, and Li stoichiometric LLZNO ceramics were obtained by sintering this powder-which is difficult to control under high sintering temperatures and when sintered for a long time-at a relatively low temperature or for a short amount of time. The particle-size distribution, phase structure, microstructure, distribution of elements, total ionic conductivity, relative density, and activation energy of the submicron LLZNO powder and the LLZNO ceramics were tested and analyzed using laser diffraction particle-size analyzer (LD), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and the Archimedean method. The total ionic conductivity of samples sintered at 1200 °C for 30 min was 5.09 × 10-4 S cm-1, the activation energy was 0.311 eV, and the relative density was 87.3%. When the samples were sintered at 1150 °C for 60 min the total ionic conductivity was 3.49 × 10-4 S cm-1, the activation energy was 0.316 eV, and the relative density was 90.4%. At the same time, quasi-solid-state batteries were assembled with LiMn2O4 as the positive electrode and submicron LLZNO powder as the solid-state electrolyte. After 50 cycles, the discharge specific capacity was 105.5 mAh/g and the columbic efficiency was above 95%.",Materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115170
The effect of lanthanoid defects on anionic solvation of Li in Li6.5La2+xZr1.5Ta0.5O12 from x = 0 to x = 1.2 garnet,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The cubic phase of lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO) is a solid electrolyte based on the garnet crystal structure which has shown promise in enabling batteries with significantly higher energy density compared to lithium-ion. Owing to its stability against lithium, LLZO is compatible with metallic lithium electrodes that, when paired with state-of-the-art cathodes, can achieve >1000 Wh/l. The preferred cubic LLZO phase is stabilized at room temperature by doping LLZO, which results in the formation of lithium vacancies (VLi′) that can achieve ionic conductivities in the 1 mS/cm range. While much attention has been paid to optimizing VLi′, discrepancies in lanthanum to zirconium (La:Zr) ratios provide an indication of the existence of vacancies at one or both of these sites. As La is the largest cation present, La vacancies should show the most dramatic effects on lattice parameter, which should affect lithium-ion transport within the LLZO sublattice. In turn, changes in lithium-ion site occupancy and solvation should affect activation energy and conductivity. However, the effects of the sub stoichiometric use of La on the crystal structure of LLZO have yet to be characterized. In this work, La content is varied in the LLZO structure Li6.5La2+xZr1.5Ta0.5O12 from x = 0 to x = 1.2. X-ray diffraction, SEM imaging, Raman Spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance measurements, and DC cycling were performed in order to correlate the effect of La deficiency on crystal structure and electrochemical properties of LLZO. Vacancy and decomposition mechanism are proposed. A linear increase in lattice parameter is observed over the range of La content measured. An increase in conductivity and CCD are also observed ranging from 0.649 mS/cm and 0.5 mA/cm2 at x = 0.2 to 0.789mS/cm and 0.80 mA/cm2 at x = 1.0.",Solid State Ionics,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227440
Achieving efficient and stable interface between metallic lithium and garnet-type solid electrolyte through a thin indium tin oxide interlayer,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramic electrolytes are promising solid electrolytes in solid-state lithium-ion batteries due to their relatively high ionic conductivity and high stability against lithium metal. However, the poor contact between garnet electrolytes and Li metal causes high interfacial resistance. In this work, we report a strategy to tackle this problem by modifying the surface of the Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) pellets with indium tin oxide (ITO), which is widely used as transparent conductive films in electronic devices. Lithium is tightly soldered on the garnet pellets through rapid reaction with the ITO interlayer. Thus the interfacial resistance of Li/LLZTO dramatically decreases from 1192 Ω cm2 to 32 Ω cm2. Due to the superior ability to homogenize current distribution, the lithiated ITO layer can protect the LLZTO pellets with low relative density (~92%) surviving at a critical current density up to 1.05 mA cm−2. Moreover, the Li/ITO-LLZTO-ITO/Li symmetric cell shows stable lithium plating/stripping over 800 h at 0.2 mA cm−2 without polarization increasing. Hybrid solid-state Li/ITO-LLZTO/LiFePO4 cell with good cycle stability and rate performance is also achieved. This work demonstrates that the ITO thin film, through conversion and alloying reactions, can effectively solder lithium anode on garnet-type solid electrolyte for high-performance lithium batteries.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1021/acsaem.9b02101

Scalable Freeze-Tape-Casting Fabrication and Pore Structure Analysis of 3D LLZO Solid-State Electrolytes,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Nonflammable solid-state electrolytes can potentially address the reliability and energy density limitations of lithium-ion batteries. Garnet-structured oxides such as Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) are some of the most promising candidates for solid-state devices. Here, three-dimensional (3D) solid-state LLZO frameworks with low tortuosity pore channels are proposed as scaffolds, into which active materials and other components can be infiltrated to make composite electrodes for solid-state batteries. To make the scaffolds, we employed aqueous freeze tape casting (FTC), a scalable and environmentally friendly method to produce porous LLZO structures. Using synchrotron radiation hard X-ray microcomputed tomography, we confirmed that LLZO films with porosities of up to 75% were successfully fabricated from slurries with a relatively wide concentration range. The acicular pore size and shape at different depths of scaffolds were quantified by fitting the pore shapes with ellipses, determining the long and short axes and their ratios, and investigating the equivalent diameter distribution. The results show that relatively homogeneous pore sizes and shapes were sustained over a long range along the thickness of the scaffold. Additionally, these pores had low tortuosity and the wall thickness distributions were found to be highly homogeneous. These are desirable characteristics for 3D solid electrolytes for composite electrodes, in terms of both the ease of active material infiltration and also minimization of Li diffusion distances in electrodes. The advantages of the FTC scaffolds are demonstrated by the improved conductivity of LLZO scaffolds infiltrated with poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PEO/LITFSI) compared to those of PEO/LiTFSI films alone or composites containing LLZO particles.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1016/j.joule.2019.11.015
Nanoscale Mapping of Extrinsic Interfaces in Hybrid Solid Electrolytes,"© 2019 Elsevier Inc.Inorganic-organic hybrid solid electrolytes are promising material systems for all solid-state batteries (ASSBs). These electrolytes contain numerous solid|solid interfaces that govern transport pathways, electrode|electrolyte compatibility, and durability.

Atomic force microscopy techniques reveal how mechanical, adhesion, and morphological properties transform in a series of model hybrid solid electrolytes. These measurements are mapped to sub-surface microstructural features using synchrotron nano-tomography. Hybrid solid electrolytes with shorter polymer chains demonstrate a higher adhesion (>100 nN), Young's Modulus (6.4 GPa), capacity (114.6 mAh/g), and capacity retention (92.9%) than hybrid electrolytes with longer polymer chains (i.e., higher molecular weight). Extrinsic interfacial properties largely dictate electrochemical performance in ASSBs. Microstructural control over inorganic constituents may provide a means for tailoring interfacial properties in hybrid solid electrolytes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.ASSBs are promising high-energy density energy storage devices. Hybrid electrolytes are material systems containing an organic and inorganic ion conductor that can achieve manufacturing, transport, and mechanical requirements of ASSBs. Hybrid electrolytes contain material junctions between the organic and inorganic phases (intrinsic) and between the electrode and electrolyte (extrinsic). Both extrinsic and intrinsic interfaces in these systems witness dynamic physical and chemical changes that can adversely impact the battery performance. Limited experimental knowledge is available for these interfaces due to the relative difficulty of accessing these interfaces. Rational design of interfaces is crucial to achieve stable, high-performance ASSBs.

Influence of the Processing on the Ionic Conductivity of Solid-State Hybrid Electrolytes Based on Glass-Ceramic Particles Dispersed in PEO with LiTFSI,"© 2020 The Author(s). Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.For the first time, glass-ceramic particles (LATP and LLZO) have been processed with both a tumbling-mixer and a kneader on semi-industrial scale. Although sintered LATP and LLZO discs reveal a statistically negligible ionic interface resistance to PEO with LiTFSI, the total conductivity of dispersed particles within a PEO-LiTFSI matrix is only slightly enhanced at 80 C. However, for a tumbling mixing process, SEM investigations prove insufficient contact of particles within the matrix as well as agglomerates, cracks and voids. With the shear intensive kneader, dense and homogeneous samples were obtained. Compared to nanometer-sized SiO2 particles, the LATP filler enable an increase of the ionic conductivity of the hybrid PEO system by a factor of about two. These finding help to overcome solvent-based mixing processes that may cause uncontrolled decomposition and surface reactions of filler particles thereby changing microscopic conduction mechanisms in the hybrid electrolytes.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1149/1945-7111/abad66
Al and Mg Co-Doping towards Development of Air-Stable and Li-Ion Conducting Li-La-Zirconate Based Solid Electrolyte Exhibiting Low Electrode/Electrolyte Interfacial Resistance,"© 2020 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS""). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.Air-stable solid electrolytes, possessing good Li-ion conductivity and facilitating low resistance at electrode/electrolyte interface, are essential towards facile development/handling of safe-cum-stable solid-state Li-ion batteries, possessing desired power densities. In this context, we report here the design and development of Al/Mg co-doped Li-La-zirconate (LLZO) based solid electrolytes that address the concerns associated with inferior air stability of Al-doped LLZO, while retaining Li-ion conductivity (∼4.7 × 10-4 s cm-1) as good as that for similarly developed Al-doped LLZO and higher than that for Mg-doped counterpart. Doping as ""little""as 0.1 mole of Mg-ion (per mole of LLZO), as for the optimized Al(0.2)/Mg(0.1) co-doped LLZO, is sufficient to impart long term phase and structural stability in air, unlike that for Al-doped LLZO. Accordingly, Li-ion conductivity of Al(0.2)/Mg(0.1) co-doped LLZO gets nearly retained even after air-exposure for 50 days, in contrast to lowering of conductivity for Al-doped LLZO by ∼3 orders of magnitude after 24 days. The influence of excellent air stability and Li-ion conductivity could be seen on the Li/LLZO interfacial resistance, with the Al(0.2)/Mg(0.1) co-doped LLZO possessing the lowest area specific resistance of ∼18 Ω cm2 among those investigated, which is also among the lowest reported to-date, without any additional surface/interfacial engineering being done.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1021/acsami.9b19981
Nonaqueous Polymer Combustion Synthesis of Cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 Nanopowders,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Garnet-type lithium lanthanum zirconate (Li7La3Zr2O12, LLZO) shows great promise as a solid electrolyte for future solid-state lithium batteries as it possesses a uniquely beneficial combination of high ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability against metallic lithium, and generally low reactivity in ambient conditions. Conventionally synthesized by using solid-state reactions, LLZO powders have also been prepared by using variations of sol-gel or combustion synthesis with sacrificial organic templates or polymers containing metal nitrate precursors. Herein, a novel nonaqueous polymer (NAP) method using metalorganic precursors and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) is demonstrated to easily form LLZO nanopowders. Compared to similar techniques using aqueous solutions with metal nitrates, the NAP method confers greater control over synthesis conditions. Undoped cubic phase LLZO is obtained after calcination at 700-800 °C between 0 and 4 h, and the NAP process is easily extended to Ta-doped LLZO. To elucidate the general formation mechanism of nanosized LLZO in the NAP combustion synthesis, scanning transmission electron microscopy is used to perform energy dispersive X-ray and electron energy loss spectral imaging. The results show that in situ formation of a carbonaceous foam during combustion physically segregates pockets of reagents and is responsible for maintaining the small particle size of the as-synthesized material during combustion and crystallization. The room temperature ionic conductivity of nanosized Ta-doped LLZO synthesized by using the NAP method was studied under various sintering conditions, with ionic conductivities between 0.24 and 0.67 mS cm-1, activation energies between 0.34 and 0.42 eV, and relative densities in excess of 90% obtained by sintering at 1100 °C for between 6 and 15 h.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1149/1945-7111/ab9a06
Effects of LiFSi and LMO-Coated NCM on Capacity and Cycle Characteristics of All-Solid Lithium Batteries,"© 2020 The Author(s). Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.The initial capacity and cycle retention properties of all-solid lithium batteries (ASLBs) were greatly improved by utilizing polyethylene oxide (PEO)/lithium salts in conjunction with LiFSi, and coating the nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NCM) cathode component with lithium manganese oxide (LMO). That is, composite cathodes for ASLBs were fabricated by using lithium salts (LiClO4/LiFSi (8:2)) with PEO, Al-LLZO powder, Super-P, and LMO-coated NCM-424/622, respectively (Al-LLZO = Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12). LiFSi was added to a solution of PEO/LiClO4 ([EO]:[Li] = 13:1) to generate a composite cathode and composite solid electrolyte (CSE) sheet. The initial capacity and cycle retention of the resulting cells were improved by controlling the side reactions and the improving kinetic characteristics. Moreover, NCM-424 and NCM-622 were coated with LMO; the optimum LMO coating amount (1 wt%) and NCM-424/622 ratio (9:1) for simultaneously improving the capacity and cycle retention were explored. Overall, the initial capacity of the ASLBs reached 152 mAh g-1, with a capacity retention rate of 92% at the 100th cycle.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1149/1945-7111/ab9b08
The Role of Local Inhomogeneities on Dendrite Growth in LLZO-Based Solid Electrolytes,"© 2020 The Author(s). Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.The majority of the ceramic solid electrolytes (LLZO, LATP) demonstrate polycrystalline grain/grain-boundary (G/GB) microstructure. Higher lithium (Li) concentration and lower mechanical stiffness result in current focusing at the GBs. Growth of Li dendrites through local inhomogeneities and subsequent short circuit of the cell is a major concern. Recent studies have revealed that bulk Li metal is a viscoplastic material that has low (∼0.3 MPa) and high (∼1.0 MPa) yield strength during deformation at smaller and larger rates of strain, respectively. It has been argued that during deposition at smaller current densities, due to its lower yield strength, Li metal should demonstrate plastic flow against stiff ceramic electrolytes, and Li dendrites will be prevented from penetrating through solid electrolytes. In this manuscript, a multiscale modeling framework has been developed for predicting properties of GBs and the bulk of ceramic electrolytes using atomistic calculations for input to mesoscale models. Using the parameters obtained from the atomistic simulations, the mesoscale model reveals that, given enough time, even at low charge rates, lithium dendrites can grow through the GBs of LLZO. The present multiscale model results also provide information regarding the dendrite growth velocity through LLZO.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1149/1945-7111/ab8478
Investigation of the Ionic Conduction Mechanism of Polyether/Li7La3Zr2O12 Composite Solid Electrolytes by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy,"© 2020 The Author(s). Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.Polyether-based polymer/cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) composite solid electrolytes were prepared by dispersing LLZO powder in a lithium (Li) conductive polyether-based solid polymer electrolyte. [SUS | electrolyte | SUS] (SUS: Stainless steel) and [Li | electrolyte | Li] symmetrical cells were fabricated, and the ionic conductivity, Li/electrolyte interfacial resistance, and Li-cation transport number of the electrolytes were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The polyether-based polymer/LLZO composite solid electrolytes showed relatively high ionic conductivity of over 10-4 S cm-1 at 333.15 K, along with high electrochemical stability and low interfacial resistance to Li metal electrodes. Remarkable changes of Cole-Cole plots were observed with the variation of LLZO content, which was attributed to the formation of local percolation pathways between LLZO grains in the polymer matrix. Li-ion conduction was faster in the LLZO phase than in the polymer phase. The Li-cation transport number of the polymer/LLZO composite solid electrolytes was almost constant value regardless of LLZO content because of the rate-limiting ionic transport in the polymer phase with a low Li-cation transport number.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1149/1945-7111/ab7fb7
Interface Modification of lithium Metal Anode and Solid-state Electrolyte with Gel Electrolyte,© 2020 The Author(s). Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.The interface between solid electrolytes and Li metal anode is a significant hurdle for the development of all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. Introducing a thin gel polymer electrolyte interlayer to conformally coat solid electrolytes can improve the interface wettability of Li metal anode and thus reduce the interfacial resistance. Here we used a plasticized poly(ethylene oxide)-based electrolyte with high concentrations of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium (LiTFSI) that show 100% amorphous character. These electrolytes show Li+ conductivity as high as σ = 2.9 × 10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature. We discovered by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with off-gas analysis in conjunction with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy that the electrolyte films had absorbed N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) vapors to form a gel electrolyte. We incorporated the gel electrolyte as an interfacial modification layer between LLZO and Li metal electrodes and found a 58 times reduction in the area specific resistance (ASR) at room temperature.,Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.3390/en13010253

During increasingly high power and high current charging and discharging, the requirement for the electrolyte becomes more strict. Solid State Electrolyte (SSE) sees its niche for high power applications due to its ability to suppress concentration polarization and otherwise stable properties also related to safety. During high power and high current cycling, heat management becomes more important and thermal conductivity measurements are needed. In this work, thermal conductivity was measured for three types of solid state electrolytes: Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP), and Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) at different compaction pressures. LAGP and LATP were measured after sintering, and LLZO was measured before and after sintering the sample material. Thermal conductivity for the sintered electrolytes was measured to 0.470 ±0.009 WK− 1m− 1, 0.5 ±0.2 WK− 1m− 1 and 0.49 ±0.02 WK− 1m− 1 for LLZO, LAGP, and LATP respectively. Before sintering, LLZO showed a thermal conductivity of 0.22 ±0.02 WK− 1m− 1.

A correlative study on electrochemical and optical properties of LLZO (Li7La3Zr2O12) garnet electrolyte,"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.The demand for alternative power sources for perceiving sustainable/clean energy has created an increasing interest and becoming more critical owing to the development of applications such as electric vehicles and new type of portable electronic devices currently available in the market. In this regard, relatively safe nature of all solid state batteries (ASSB) makes it distinct as a viable battery over the battery research scenario. Improvement of the technology predominantly depends on the solid electrolyte material employed in the batteries. A very good solid electrolyte must have high ionic conductivity as well as a wide electrochemical window. Lithium Lanthanum Zirconate (LLZO) is one of the promising electrolyte materials for All Solid State Batteries (ASSB). In the present work, LLZO powders have been prepared via a solution route synthesis. The morphology and the purity of the samples were analysed using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (EIS). The ionic conductivities of the samples were investigated using alternating current Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. UV–vis Spectroscopy was employed to determine the optical band gap of LLZO, and the value (~6 V) was in agreement with the potential window of LLZO available in the literature. The high potential window and good ionic conducting properties shows that LLZO is a better alternative electrolyte material for next generation solid-state assemblies.",Materials Today: Proceedings,10.20964/2020.08.67
Rapid fabrication of of Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte with enhanced lithium ionic conductivity by microwave sintering,"© 2020 The Authors.Traditional preparation method of solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 requires a very long sintering holding time (> 36 hours). A efficient and mass production method, microwave sintering, is utilized to prepared LLZO by which the sintering time is reduced to be 2 ~ 4 h. Results show that cubic phase LLZO can be obtained at 1150 °C ~ 1200 °C. With the increase of holding time from 1 h to 4 h, tetragonal LLZO transforms to cubic which suggests extra thermal energy is generated by coupling dielectric loss with microwave. Pellet sintered with 4 h reaches the highest ionic conductivity of 3.1 × 10-4 S cm-1. Long holding time of 6 h will take away a lot of Li from the grain to form excess glass-like phase which is not favorable for conductivity.",International Journal of Electrochemical Science,10.1186/s11671-020-03378-x
Reduced Energy Barrier for Li+ Transport Across Grain Boundaries with Amorphous Domains in LLZO Thin Films,"© 2020, The Author(s).The high-resistive grain boundaries are the bottleneck for Li+ transport in Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolytes. Herein, high-conductive LLZO thin films with cubic phase and amorphous domains between crystalline grains are prepared, via annealing the repetitive LLZO/Li2CO3/Ga2O3 multi-nanolayers at 600 °C for 2 h. The amorphous domains may provide additional vacant sites for Li+, and thus relax the accumulation of Li+ at grain boundaries. The significantly improved ionic conductivity across grain boundaries demonstrates that the high energy barrier for Li+ migration caused by space charge layer is effectively reduced. Benefiting from the Li+ transport paths with low energy barriers, the presented LLZO thin film exhibits a cutting-edge value of ionic conductivity as high as 6.36 × 10−4 S/cm, which is promising for applications in thin film lithium batteries.",Nanoscale Research Letters,10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.998.215
Xrd and sem analyses of bulk ga-doped li7la3zr2o12 li-ion conducting solid electrolyte prepared via hot-pressing method,"© 2020 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.In this study, bulk lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte of Ga-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Li7-3XGaxLa3Zr2O12) where x = 0.1 (Ga-LLZO) was prepared via hot pressing at 500oC. Precursor powder for hot-pressing was prepared using conventional solid state reaction method. Planetary ball milling was employed to investigate the particle size effect on the structure and densification of hot-pressed samples. XRD patterns of the bulk hot-pressed sample revealed a crystalline phase of which the major peaks observed can be indexed to a cubic LLZO structure; however, a major impurity phase of La2Zr2O7 was observed for the ball-milled sample. Thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis showed about 12% weight loss below 900oC which may have affected the observed hot-pressing structure. Although lower density measurement and an impurity phase of La2Zr2O7 were observed for the ball-milled sample, ball-milling also resulted to a more homogeneous and finer particle size as shown by SEM images results.",Materials Science Forum,10.1088/2053-1591/ab7618
Preparation and structural stability of LiFePO4|Ga-LLZO composite cathode material heat-treated at intermediate temperatures,"© 2020 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.In this study, cathode and lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte composite pellet with 1:1 wt. % composition of LiFePO4 and Li7-3XGaxLa3Zr2O12 (x = 0.1) (LiFePO4|Ga-LLZO) was prepared via solid-state reaction. The aim of the study is to investigate the phase stability between LiFePO4 cathode and Ga-LLZO solid electrolyte material when heat treated at 400 to 600 °C. The asmixed LiFePO4|Ga-LLZO composite was characterized by TG/DTA and the heat treated sample was then analyzed for its structure using XRD and compared to the just as-mixed composite. XRD patterns of the heat treated composite pellet showed that it retains its as-mixed phases of LiFePO4 and Ga- LLZO when sintered below 500 °C under Ar gas flow environment. However, upon heat treatment at 600 °C, the sample already reacted and decomposed with the formation of other phases.",Materials Science Forum,10.1039/c9ta09401f
Spark plasma sintering plus heat-treatment of Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte and its ionic conductivity,"© 2020 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Ta-LLZO) solid electrolyte ceramics were synthesized by solid-state sintering, spark plasma sintering (SPS) and SPS plus heat-treatment (two-step method) using LiOH•H2O, La2O3, ZrO2 and Ta2O5 as the raw materials. The Ta-LLZO samples prepared from these three routes are all in cubic phase structure. However, the solid-state method results in Ta-LLZO samples with different particle sizes and porous morphology, while the samples prepared by SPS route contain fewer internal voids and smaller particle size. The two-step method not only retains the high compactness of SPS samples, but also the increment of grain size. The SEM results demonstrate that Ta-LLZO sintered by the two-step method shows optimal electrical properties. And the total ionic conductivity is 4.6 × 10-3 S cm-1 at 150 °C and the activation energy is calculated to be 0.38 eV.",Materials Research Express,10.1111/jmi.12857
Comparison of computational methods for the electrochemical stability window of solid-state electrolyte materials,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Superior stability and safety are key promises attributed to all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) containing solid-state electrolyte (SSE) compared to their conventional counterparts utilizing liquid electrolyte. To unleash the full potential of ASSBs, SSE materials that are stable when in contact with the low and high potential electrodes are required. The electrochemical stability window is conveniently used to assess the SSE-electrode interface stability. In the present work, we review the most important methods to compute the SSE stability window. Our analysis reveals that the stoichiometry stability method represents a bridge between the HOMO-LUMO method and the phase stability method (grand canonical phase diagram). Moreover, we provide computational implementations of these methods for SSE material screening. We compare their results for the relevant Li- A nd Na-SSE materials LGPS, LIPON, LLZO, LLTO, LATP, LISICON, and NASICON, and we discuss their relation to published experimental stability windows.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1016/j.ensm.2019.08.017
Comparison of xenon and gallium sources on the detection and mapping of lithium in Li-containing materials by using ToF-SIMS combined FIB-SEM,"© 2019 The Authors Journal of Microscopy © 2019 Royal Microscopical SocietyLi can find itself a wide range of applications since it is the lightest metal. However, Li detection by microscopy-based techniques is problematic because of the highly susceptible nature during electron beam irradiation.

In spite of smoother milling from Ga source, Xe performs more precisely in Li mapping. Low ion contaminated zone, high sputtering yield and low straggling obtained from Monte Carlo simulations are the main advantages of Xe ion sources. The Li detection efficiency for Xe is higher than Ga source discriminating the LiAlO2 phase placed at the triple junctions of grains and La2Zr2O7 regions placed at the outer side of LLZO neighbouring the LiAlO2 phase.

Ion dynamics in Al-Stabilized Li7La3Zr2O12 single crystals – Macroscopic transport and the elementary steps of ion hopping,"© 2019 The Author(s)Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet-type ceramics are considered as very promising candidates for solid electrolytes and have been extensively studied in the past few years. Several studies report on an increase in ionic conductivity by doping with ions, such as Al3+ and Ga3+, to stabilize the cubic modification of LLZO. Unfortunately, so far ion dynamics have mainly been studied using powdered samples. Such studies may suffer from chemical heterogeneities concerning Al distribution. Here, we took advantage of Al-stabilized LLZO single crystals to throw light on the elementary steps of ion hopping. We used 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin-lattice relaxation measurements and conductivity spectroscopy to probe dynamic parameters from both a microscopic and macroscopic point of view. At 293 K the total conductivity turned out to be 0.082 mS cm−1, which is remarkably good for LLZO exhibiting an Al-content of only 0.37 wt%. Most importantly, 7Li NMR spin-lock transients revealed two overlapping diffusion-induced processes. Overall, activation energies from spin-lock NMR excellently agree with that from conductivity measurements; both techniques yield values around 0.36 eV. The corresponding diffusion coefficients deduced from NMR and conductivity measurements almost coincide. The magnetic spin fluctuations sensed by NMR provide an in-depth look at the elementary jump processes, which can barely be revealed by macroscopic impedance spectroscopy providing average values. In particular, we were able to precisely measure the local hopping barrier (0.20 eV) characterizing forward-backward jumps between the sites 24d and 96h.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115089
Aluminum-Assisted Densification of Cosputtered Lithium Garnet Electrolyte Films for Solid-State Batteries,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a promising solid-state electrolyte due to its wide electrochemical stability window and high Li-ion conductivity. This electrolyte has potential to be employed in the form of thin films for solid-state batteries, a promising approach in the quest for safer batteries with higher energy densities at lower fabrication costs. In this study, we use a scalable cosputtering process to fabricate LLZO thin films with subsequent postannealing at a temperature of 700 °C, significantly below the sintering temperatures employed in ceramic pellet processing. We investigate the roles that Li excess and incorporation of Al play in the film's crystalline phase, microstructure, phase stability, and, ultimately, ionic conductivity. Our results reveal that improving the conductivity of LLZO thin films requires not only the stabilization of the cubic phase but especially the densification of the film and the minimization of the proton exchange degradation mechanism in the presence of moisture and CO2. These issues can be mitigated by effectively controlling the amount of Li and incorporating Al as sintering agent. An ionic conductivity at room temperature of 1.9 × 10-5 S cm-1 was achieved with a 400 nm Al-substituted LLZO thin film. Finally, we prove that these LLZO thin films can be successfully deposited and crystallized on a LiCoO2 cathode.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1007/978-3-030-31581-8_2
AC conductivity studies of polyethylene oxide-garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 hybrid composite solid polymer electrolyte films,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.We have investigated both AC dielectric permittivity and ionic conductivity of hybrid composite solid polymer electrolyte (CSPE) films (~100 μm) comprised of sub-micron sized aluminum substituted cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) particles dispersed in polyethylene oxide-LiClO4 (PEO-LiClO4) matrix with [EO]:[Li] = 15:1. Homogeneous CSPE films with 50 wt% LLZO (PEO-LLZO-LiClO4) exhibit good flexibility and mechanical robustness up to 120 °C. The electrochemical potential stability window measured for these films was ~5.2 V vs. Li+/Li. The complex AC permittivity and conductivity were determined using the measured electrical impedance spectra in the range of 1 Hz to 300 kHz and found to be heavily affected by the electrode polarization in low frequency region. We have analyzed the data using an expression for complex AC conductivity that generalizes the power-law dependence taking into account the effect of electrode polarization and involving ionic and polymer segmental relaxation times in its description. This expression describes very well the observed behavior of AC dielectric permittivity and conductivity in the entire measured frequency region. The ionic and segmental relaxation times obtained from fitting the experimental data indicate a strong coupling between the ionic motion and segmental dynamics. Further, the observed temperature dependent conductivity follows the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) behavior implying a close correlation between ionic conductivity and segmental relaxation in these polymer electrolytes. The VTF model yields an activation energy of 0.32 eV for PEO-LiClO4 film, and 0.07 eV for PEO-LLZO-LiClO4 composite film, consistent with the observed enhancement in conductivity by two orders of magnitude at 30 °C upon the addition of LLZO particles.",Solid State Ionics,10.1007/978-3-030-31581-8_7

Scalable Manufacturing of Hybrid Solid Electrolytes with Interface Control,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Hybrid solid electrolytes are promising alternatives for high energy density metallic lithium batteries. Scalable manufacturing of multi-material electrolytes with tailored transport pathways can provide an avenue toward controlling Li stripping and deposition mechanisms in all-solid-state devices. A novel roll-To-roll compatible coextrusion device is demonstrated to investigate mesostructural control during manufacturing. Solid electrolytes with 25 and 75 wt % PEO-LLZO compositions are investigated.

The effect of limonite addition on the performance of Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Nowadays, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) based solid electrolytes are attracting much interest because of their enhanced safety in Li-ion batteries. However, their relatively low ionic conductivity compared to liquid electrolytes is the main factor affecting the widespread use. Fe doping of LLZO could raise the ionic conductivity values to one of the highest values measured in the field of garnet type LLZO solid electrolytes. However, high purity and cost Fe2O3 is the unique iron source used in Fe doped LLZO systems. In this study, the potential use of common and cheaper iron source α-FeOOH in the form of limonite ore as a multielement containing alternative Fe source was explored. The concept of the naturally found ore usage as a stabilizing agent in LLZO is first time reported. The results showed that the limonite addition to LLZO increased the ionic behavior and densification by modifying the open and closed porosities. Higher radial shrinkage was observed with increasing limonite content. The increasing sintering time came up with an enhancement on ionic resistance and a drop on grain boundary resistance as well as DC conductivity.

Effects of CuO on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of garnet-type Li6.3La3Zr1.65W0.35O12 solid electrolyte,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdThe garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)-based oxides have attracted much attention for solid-state lithium (Li)-ion batteries because of high Li ion conductivity and good chemical stability. However, high-temperature sintering at around 1200 °C and a long sintering time above 10 h are normally required to obtain dense LLZO pellets. Dense sintering of solid electrolytes at low temperature or short sintering time is highly desired for developing high-performance solid-state rechargeable batteries. In this work, we investigate the effect of CuO as a sintering aid on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of garnet-type Li6.3La3Zr1.65W0.35O12 (LLZWO) solid electrolyte through conventional solid-state reaction. The addition of a small amount of CuO can effectively lower the sintering temperature of LLZWO to 1120 °C and reduce sintering time to 6 h. The ionic conductivity of the obtained 2 wt% CuO–LLZWO electrolyte is 1.88 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C and melted metallic Li shows good wetting behavior toward CuO–LLZWO pellets. Moreover, the LiFePO4|2 wt% CuO–LLZWO|Li battery shows a capacity of 144.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and 65 °C. Even at 1 C, the capacity of the cell can remain at 104.7 mAh g−1.

Elastic and well-aligned ceramic LLZO nanofiber based electrolytes for solid-state lithium batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Ceramic Li7La3Zr2O12 is one of the most attractive electrolyte materials for solid-state batteries due to its high ionic conductivity and chemical/thermal stability, but the battery performance is always limited by the high electrolyte-electrode interfacial resistances. Here, we have fabricated elastic solid electrolytes by filling ionic-conductive polymers into well-aligned Li6.4La3Zr2Al0.2O12 (LLZO) nanofiber films. Such electrolytes can provide fast and continuous ionic-transportation channels and thus exhibit a high ionic conductivity of 1.16 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C. Moreover, the elastic surfaces of the electrolytes can well conform to electrodes without separations to adapt volume changes of the electrodes during the repeated cycles, enabling a stable Li plating/stripping cycling over 700 h. Fabricated solid-state NCA//Li cells exhibit ultra-low internal resistances of 87 Ω and deliver large discharge capacities with high Coulombic efficiencies that are comparable with the liquid type batteries. The reported approach allows low-cost fabrication of solid electrolytes that possess high ionic conductivity for solid state batteries.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1088/1757-899X/678/1/012150
"Preparation of dense Ta-LLZO/MgO composite Li-ion solid electrolyte: Sintering, microstructure, performance and the role of MgO","© 2019 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesCubic phase Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), a member of the Li–Garnet family, is a promising solid electrolyte and has been widely studied in recent years. However, LLZO samples prepared via conventional ambient air sintering reported in the published literature often contain large grains with lower than desired (<94%) relative density. In this study, a non-contact method of co-firing with mother powder method is proposed to prepare high-quality Ta-doped LLZO–MgO composite ceramics. By sintering at 1150°C for 5 h, the ceramics can reach relative density of 98.2%, conductivity of 5.17 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C and fracture strength of ∼150 MPa. The sintered samples have uniform fine-grained microstructure and high critical current densities of 0.75–0.95 mA cm−2 at room temperature in Li–Li symmetry cell with Au modification.

Interfacial Reactions and Performance of Li7La3Zr2O12-Stabilized Li-Sulfur Hybrid Cell,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Herein, we report on the characterization of a Li-S hybrid cell containing a garnet solid electrolyte (Li7La3Zr2O12, LLZO) and conventional liquid electrolyte. While the liquid electrolyte provided ionically conductive pathways throughout the porous cathode, the LLZO acted as a physical barrier to protect the Li metal anode and prevent polysulfide shuttling during battery operation. This hybrid cell exhibited an initial capacity of 1000 mAh/g(S) and high Coulombic efficiency (>99%). The interface between the liquid electrolyte and LLZO was studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These results indicate that a spontaneous interfacial reaction layer formed between the LLZO and liquid electrolyte. XPS depth profiling experiments indicate that this layer consisted of Li-enriched phases near the surface (e.g., Li2CO3) and intermediate Li-La-Zr oxides in subsurface regions. The reaction layer extended well beyond the LLZO surface, and bulk pristine LLZO was not observed even at the deepest sputtering depths used in this study (∼90 nm). Overall, these results highlight that developing stable electrode/electrolyte interfaces is critical for solid-state batteries and their hybrids.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2019.06.038
Diffusion Limitation of Lithium Metal and Li–Mg Alloy Anodes on LLZO Type Solid Electrolytes as a Function of Temperature and Pressure,"© 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe morphological instability of the lithium metal anode is the key factor restricting the rate capability of lithium metal solid state batteries. During lithium stripping, pore formation takes place at the interface due to the slow diffusion kinetics of vacancies in the lithium metal. The resulting current focusing increases the internal cell resistance and promotes fast lithium penetration. In this work, galvanostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used to investigate operando the morphological changes at the interface by analysis of the interface capacitances. Therewith, the effect of temperature, stack pressure, and chemical modification is investigated. The work demonstrates that introducing 10 at% Mg into the lithium metal anode can effectively prevent contact loss. Nevertheless, a fundamental kinetic limitation is also observed for the Li-rich alloy, namely the diffusion controlled decrease of the lithium metal concentration at the interface. An analytical diffusion model is used to describe the temperature-dependent delithiation kinetics of Li–Mg alloys. Overall, it is shown that different electrode design concepts should be considered. Mg alloying can increase lithium utilization, when no external pressure is applied while pure lithium metal is superior for setups that allow stack pressures in the MPa range.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2019.01.018
Flash sintering of Li-ion conducting ceramic in a few seconds at 850 °C,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdShort sintering times and low furnace temperatures characterize the flash sintering process. The method can enable sintering of compounds of lithium since, in conventional sintering, which requires several hours at high furnace temperatures, it can become difficult to control the retention of lithium.

Manipulating Li2O atmosphere for sintering dense Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Cubic Li-Garnet (c-Li7La3Zr2O12, c-LLZO) is a promising solid electrolyte, however, it is very hard to prepare highly densified LLZO ceramics under air ambient condition. In this work, sintering in the presence of, but without direct contact with, “mother powder” as a lithium-compound vapor control strategy has been proposed. The existence of volatile Lithium compounds (mainly Li2O gas) are proved and the impact of the Li2O(g) atmosphere on LLZO sintering has been elucidated. At a low level, ceramics shows all trans-granular fracture microstructure; while at a high level, abnormal grain growth (AGG) occurs. Microstructure evolution under these two sintering conditions is evaluated, where a very rapid densification speed is observed for LLZO. A gas-liquid-solid sintering mechanism is proposed, where Li2O gas condenses to liquids on the surfaces of LLZO grains to promote the solid material transportation. Thence, the sintering duration for high ionic conductive Ta doped LLZO ceramics can be greatly slashed to 30 min with low-cost conventional solid-state reaction and air ambient sintering techniques. In addition, this work provides a universal and efficient strategy for production of high ionic conductive Ta-LLZO ceramics with relative densities of 97–98%, conductivities of ~1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C, critical current density of 0.9 mA cm−2 and highly-densified microstructure, which is fundamental for further researches on solid-state batteries.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1039/c9ee01548e
Preparation and characterization of Ga and Sr co-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 garnet-type solid electrolyte,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Due to promising ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, good chemical and thermal stability, garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte has attracted much attentions in the field of solid-state lithium batteries.

A bird's-eye view of Li-stuffed garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 ceramic electrolytes for advanced all-solid-state Li batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Batteries with a solid-state electrolyte and a Li anode (solid-state Li batteries, SSLBs) are being considered to replace conventional organic liquid-based Li-ion batteries due to SSLBs' promise of higher energy density and improved safety. The crucial component in SSLBs is the solid-state electrolyte which must fulfill requirements in Li-ion conductivity, electrochemical stability, and chemical stability towards the cathode and Li anode. Recently, much attention has been given to a class of ceramics with a garnet-type structure, specifically on compositions based on Li-stuffed Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) because they fulfill all the enumerated requirements for a solid-state electrolyte. In this review, we update the progress and analyze the trends in the three main approaches to realize the technological application of LLZO as an electrolyte in SSLBs: (i) crystal structure and lithium content control by doping to enhance Li-ion conductivity of LLZO, (ii) microstructure and dimension control by material processing and thin-film fabrication to reduce electrolyte resistance, and (iii) LLZO-electrode interface tuning to reduce interfacial resistance and improve battery performance. Finally, we offer our perspectives on research paths toward the realization of practical batteries with LLZO solid electrolytes.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.04.023
Enhanced mechanical strength and ionic conductivity of LLZO solid electrolytes by oscillatory pressure sintering,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Oscillatory pressure sintering (OPS) is a novel sintering technique which can promote the densification of ceramic samples due to a periodic fluctuant pressure applied during sintering. In this work, OPS was successfully adopted to prepare Li-garnet solid electrolytes (Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12) for the first time. Compared with the sample sintered by conventional hot-pressing (HP), the solid electrolytes sintered by OPS have higher density and finer grain structure, and consequent higher mechanical properties as well as higher Li+ ion conductivity. The results indicate that the LLZO electrolytes fabricated by OPS process have improved mechanical properties, 241 ± 20 MPa of bending strength, 2.89 ± 0.13 MPa m1/2 of fracture toughness and 8.69 ± 0.33 GPa of Vickers hardness. Meanwhile, the electrolytes possess high conductivity at room temperature of 4.43 × 10−4 S cm−1. High strength and high conductivity are attributed to the rapid densification and the inhibited grain growth induced by the oscillatory pressure.",Ceramics International,10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b01967
Defect chemistry in cubic Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte: A density functional theory study,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 is a promising solid electrolyte material for all-solid-state batteries. In this study, by applying Coulomb energy analysis, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and thermodynamics considerations, we have investigated defect chemistry in Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (Al-LLZO). Defect formation energy plots indicate that decreasing or increasing of Li+ concentration in Al-LLZO is unfavorable. To preserve the charge neutrality, any removed (added) Li+ must be compensated by adding (removing) Li+, which can be viewed as a rearrangement of Li+ ions. The energy cost for Li+ displacement is very low (∼0.1 eV), which is in line with the (Li) ionic-conductive nature of Al-LLZO. For a wide range of Li chemical potentials, under Zr poor condition, a complex defect type consisting of 2 added Li+ together with one removed O2− and one removed Zr4+ is the most favorable. Under O poor condition, a Schottky-like defect comprising of a cluster of 2Li+ and O2− vacancies with ≈0.2 eV higher formation energy is the second most favorable defect. In addition, we found that for a narrow range of low (high) Li chemical potentials, removed (added) neutral Li is the most favorable defect type. Our results show that decreasing or increasing of Li content in bulk Al-LLZO is only possible through the formation of complex defects or neutral removed/added Li under Li poor/rich conditions.",Solid State Ionics,10.1021/acs.iecr.9b03376
Interfacial Electronic Properties Dictate Li Dendrite Growth in Solid Electrolytes,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.The experimental observation of Li dendrite growth inside mechanically hard solid electrolytes (SEs) raised an important question: can hard SEs mechanically stop Li-dendrite growth? Here, we report a multiscale model coupling density functional theory calculations with the phase-field method to address the question. In particular, we investigate the roles of internal defects, such as pores and crack surfaces, inside a number of SEs including cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO), β-Li3PS4, Li1.17Al0.17Ti1.83(PO4)3 (LATP), and Li2PO2N. It is shown that LLZO surfaces have a much smaller band gap than the corresponding bulk and thus could trap significant excess electrons, whereas the other three systems do not exhibit significant differences in the surface and bulk band gaps. A fully coupled phase-field model was then developed to further examine the impact of excess surface electrons on the Li dendrite growth morphology in polycrystalline LLZO. This model successfully explained the experimentally observed dendrite intergranular growth and revealed that the trapped electrons may produce isolated Li-metal nucleation, leading to a sudden increase of Li-dendrite penetration depth. Finally, we compared the basic material properties and found that the ranked Li dendrite resistance in these SEs, based on the surface electronic properties instead of mechanical properties, is consistent with a broad range of experimental observations. Therefore, surface band gap and its alignment with Li-metal, as well as the excess electron distribution, can be used as key material properties to determine Li dendrite resistance of SEs.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.04.021
Needleless electrospinning for high throughput production of li7la3zr2o12 solid electrolyte nanofibers,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a promising ceramic Li-ion conductor that has been successfully prepared in nanowire morphology using electrospinning from polymer/sol-gel solutions followed by calcination. However, conventional single-needle electrospinning has low production rates <0.1 g/h, making scale-up of the materials for applications in solid-state electrolytes challenging. Herein, needleless electrospinning using a twisted wire spinneret is employed to prepare Al-doped LLZO (ALLZO). We find that the appropriate precursor solutions for needleless electrospinning require much lower viscosity and are more sensitive to environmental conditions than those used in single-needle electrospinning. The as-formed nanofibers display a nanoribbon morphology, and calcination at 700 °C for 2 h in air results in phase pure ALLZO interconnected nanostructures with a cubic crystal structure. The results show that needleless electrospinning is an effective approach for preparing as-spun nanofibers with yields of â 1 g/h possible, providing a higher throughput route toward Li+ conducting nanostructures for solid-state battery applications.",Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research,10.1016/j.joule.2019.06.013
Germanium as a donor dopant in garnet electrolytes,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet electrolytes continue to be viewed as an enabler of all-solid-state lithium battery technologies, or as protective membranes for next-generation lithium battery systems. Supervalent dopants at the lithium sublattice are commonly used to stabilise the conductive cubic phase, through the creation of lithium vacancies. The use of germanium (Ge4+) as a higher valent dopant substituting for Li+ was studied here and shown to stabilise the cubic LLZO phase through substitution of x = 0.10 mol of Ge (at the tetrahedral 24d Li sites of the space group Ia-3d, based on the neutron powder diffraction result). This substitution preference follows that of Al3+ (having a similar ionic radius and reported to reside at 24d sites), but with a lower critical concentration for cubic phase stabilisation, in agreement with charge neutrality arguments to obtain the required Li content (ca. 6.4–6.6 per formula unit) for optimum conductivity. The x = 0.10 composition gave the highest bulk Li ion conductivity of 2.8 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, on the order of reported values for Al-doped LLZO. Surface chemical analysis using time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry showed Ge homogeneously distributed within the grains as well as some Li-, O- and Ge- enrichment along the grain boundaries. Cyclic voltammetry of the cells containing Ge-doped LLZO showed a redox stability up to +5 V.",Solid State Ionics,10.1016/j.actamat.2019.06.033

The major problem limiting the rate capability of solid-state batteries with a lithium-metal anode during charging is the issue of lithium penetration through the solid electrolyte that results in short circuits. Here, we show a detailed study of the microkinetic aspects of lithium metal deposition on LLZO-type garnet electrolytes, which was found to be one of the decisive steps toward understanding the lithium-penetration susceptibility of inorganic crystalline solid electrolytes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)-based garnet materials are recently being investigated as suitable electrolytes for solid-state batteries with lithium-metal electrodes. Unfortunately, lithium-metal penetration through polycrystalline garnet-type electrolytes limits the electric current density during cell charging. In this study, we introduce an electrochemical operando approach that is well suited to get insights into the early stage of lithium-metal penetration that was yet only accessible with very elaborate neutron measurements.

"Exploring Li-ion conductivity in cubic, tetragonal and mixed-phase Al-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 using atomistic simulations and effective medium theory","© 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a promising solid electrolyte candidate for solid-state Li-ion batteries, but at room temperature it crystallizes in a poorly Li-ion conductive tetragonal phase. To this end, partial substitution of Li+ by Al3+ ions is an effective way to stabilize the highly conductive cubic phase at room temperature. Yet, fundamental aspects regarding this aliovalent substitution remain poorly understood. In this work, we use molecular dynamics and advanced hybrid Monte Carlo methods for systematic study of the room temperature Li-ion diffusion in tetragonal and cubic LLZO to shed light on important open questions. We find that Al substitution in tetrahedral sites of the tetragonal LLZO allows previously inaccessible sites to become available, which enhances Li-ion conductivity. In contrast, in the cubic phase Li-ion diffusion paths become blocked in the vicinity of Al ions, resulting in a decrease of Li-ion conductivity. Moreover, combining the conductivities of individual phases through an effective medium approximation allowed us to estimate the conductivities of cubic/tetragonal phase mixtures that are in good agreement with those reported in several experimental works. This suggests that phase coexistence (due to phase equilibrium or gradients in Al content within a sample) could have a significant impact on the conductivity of Al-substituted LLZO, particularly at low contents of Al3+. Overall, by making a thorough comparison with reported experimental data, the theoretical study and simulations of this work advance our current understanding of Li-ion mobility in Al-substituted LLZO garnets and might guide future in-depth characterization experiments of this relevant energy storage material.",Acta Materialia,10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.04.274
Overcoming the abnormal grain growth in Ga-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 to enhance the electrochemical stability against Li metal,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte is a promising candidate for next generation batteries. In the LLZO family with various doping elements, Ga-doped LLZO (Ga-LLZO) delivers the highest Li-ion conductivity of higher than 1 × 10−3 S cm−1. However, Ga-LLZO ceramics always contain lots of overgrown huge grains after sintering, resulting in short-circuiting as applied with Li anode in batteries. Hence a simple two-step sintering strategy is developed to prepare fine-grained Ga-LLZO ceramics with good electrochemical properties. Pellets with the composition of Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12 deliver pure garnet phase, uniform fine grains, high relative density of 97.3% and conductivity of 1.24 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 27 °C after sintering at 1150 °C for 1 min and 1000 °C for 3 h. In addition, those fine-grained Ga-LLZO exhibit improved stability against molten Li. The Li/Ga-LLZO/Li symmetric cells show a critical current density of 0.7 mA cm−2, and a stable cycling of over 600 h at 0.4 mA cm−2 at 27 °C. The Li/Ga-LLZO/LiFePO4 full cells deliver reversible capacity of 150 mAh g−1, showing negligible decay after 50 cycles. These results bring the Ga-LLZO electrolytes one step closer to practical application in solid-state batteries.",Ceramics International,10.1007/s10008-019-04296-4
Rational design of strontium antimony co-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 electrolyte membrane for solid-state lithium batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Considering significant safety advantages, all solid-state LIBs have attracted considerable attentions as alternative power sources for electric vehicles where safety is a big concern, while the development of solid electrolyte membrane with high lithium-ion conductivity, negligible electron conductivity and high stability is the key challenge. Here, Sr and Sb co-doping strategy was applied to further improve the sintering capability and conductivity properties of Li7La3Zr2O12 garnet-type electrolytes. Specifically, Li6.6+xLa3-xSrxZr1.6Sb0.4O12 (x = 0–0.2) oxides were designed and the physical and electrochemical performance of the various materials were comparatively studied. The results of X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra revealed Li6.6+xLa3-xSrxZr1.6Sb0.4O12 (x = 0–0.2) prepared by conventional solid-state reaction was in cubic structure. The introduction of a small amount of Sr into the La sites is beneficial for membrane densification and lithium-ion mobility, turning out high density of 95.1% and ionic conductivity of 8.83 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. The EIS showed the doping of Sr in La sites resulted in improved conductivity at both grain boundary and the oxide bulk. The batteries consisting of lithium film anode, Li6.66La2.94Sr0.06Zr1.6Sb0.4O12 solid electrolyte membrane and LiFePO4 cathode reached the first discharge capacity of 157 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C between 4.2 and 2.0 V (vs. L/Li+) with capacity retention of 93% after 100 cycles at ambient temperature.

In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigation of the solid electrolyte interphase in a Li/Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12/LiFePO4 all-solid-state battery,"© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The fundamental understanding of the solid electrolyte/electrode interphase during charge and discharge is promising for the development of all-solid-state batteries. Here, we employ a solid-state Li/Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12/LiFePO4 cell and study in situ the electrolyte/anode and electrolyte/cathode interphase as a function of applied potential under ultra-high vacuum using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. An ultra-thin interfacial passivation layer is formed at the Li/Ga-doped LLZO interphase, which inhibits the Ga-LLZO from being further reduced by Li. During charging, the oxidation reaction of Li with Ga-LLZO still occurs, which is evidenced by the broadening of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and shifting of the Li 1s peak towards lower binding energies and the increment of Li2O peak intensity in the O 1s range. The Ga-LLZO solid electrolyte/LiFePO4 cathode interphase was also studied by in situ XPS under UHV. The deintercalation of Li+ ion is evidenced by the broadening and shifting of Fe 2p peak during charging. Other components shift by the same values as the applied potential. These results indicate good reversibility of the LiFePO4/Ga-LLZO interphase upon charge/discharge. The long-term stability of the LiFePO4/Ga-LLZO interphase was also examined during charging/discharging for 100 cycles. These insights provide a new perspective for understanding of the solid electrolyte interphase, which enables high energy density, long-term stability, and safety for next-generation batteries.

High-pressure field assisted sintering of half-cell for all-solid-state battery,© 2019 Elsevier B.V.High-pressure field assisted sintering (FAST/SPS) of half-cell for all-solid-state Li batteries was proposed and tested. The half-cell included the layer of lithium lanthanum zirconate (LLZO) electrolyte and the layer of mixed cathode. The mixed cathode consisted of lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) used as energy storage material and LLZO used as ionic conductor. A tool made of TZM molybdenum alloy was used to apply a high pressure of 440 MPa during FAST/SPS at a temperature of 675 °C ensuring stability of materials. An average relative density of sintered half-cell was around of 95%. The half-cell was assembled with a lithium anode and electrochemically tested. The results were compared with the performance of a half-cell sintered in an established graphite tool at the same temperature but under a lower pressure of 50 MPa and with a lower density (around of 78%). The battery with half-cell sintered at high pressure showed two-fold larger surface storage capacity.

Study of the local structure and electrical properties of gallium substituted LLZO electrolyte materials,"© 2019The solid-state lithium batteries are more stable than the batteries with liquid electrolyte, however their performance are also worse especially due to the low ionic conduction of their electrolyte. Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 is a promising solid-state electrolyte candidate for lithium batteries. In this work the influence of gallium substitution on the electrical, crystal and electronic structure properties in the Li7La3Zr2O12 material were studied. Li7-3xGaxLa3Zr2O12 solid electrolytes were synthesized by solid state reaction method and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), AC impedance spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques. XRD and XAS analyses showed that the x = 0.05 sample is formed in the tetragonal phase with a space group of I41/acd:2 and the rest are formed in the cubic phase with a space group of I-43d due to strong coupling between outer shell electrons of the oxygen (O) and gallium (Ga) atoms.

Effect of the lithium ion concentration on the lithium ion conductivity of Ga-doped LLZO,"© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.The Li+ concentration of the Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte is regarded as a significant factor impacting the Li+ conductivity. In this research, a conventional solid-state method has been used to synthesize Ga-doped LLZO (Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12) with different Li+ concentrations by adjusting the heating rate. The focal point of this research is the influence of the heating rate on the Li+ concentration and the effect of the Li+ concentration on the Li+ conductivity. The results show that the lithium loss primarily decreases and then increases with the rise of the heating rate. Hence, the Li+ concentration rises initially and drops afterwards. When the sample is sintered at 1200 °C for 18 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min-1, the amount of Li+ is 6.55 moles. The sample exhibits a maximum Li+ conductivity of 1.09 ×10-3 S•cm-1 at room temperature.",Materials Research Express,10.1002/adts.201900028

The Ab Initio Calculations on the Areal Specific Resistance of Li-Metal/Li7La3Zr2O12 Interphase,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe solid–solid interfacial impedance between the garnet electrolyte and Li metal anode is one of the major challenges for garnet's application in all-solid-state batteries. The areal specific resistance (ASR) is investigated by ab initio calculations in this article, to predict the intrinsic ASR as lower limitation. The Li ion migration across the interphase is divided into two steps: 1) Li ""intercalation"" from Li-metal to the LLZO, forming a Li-rich interphase beneath the surface of LLZO, and 2) Li migration in the Li-rich interphase within LLZO. The first step is investigated by climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB), resulting in barrier energy lower than 0.37 eV compared to experimental 0.34 eV of the garnet bulk phase. The second step is investigated by ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD), indicating that the Li-rich interphase's conductivity is lower by about 1–2 orders of magnitude compared to the bulk phase. As a result, the sum theoretical intrinsic ASR is as low as 0.01 Ω cm2, suggesting high ASR in practicable battery arises from surficial impurity Li2CO3 rather than intrinsic ionic resistance. However, difficulties of removing Li2CO3 lie in that Li7La3Zr2O12 can thermodynamically decompose into reactive Li2O to form high resistant Li2CO3.",Advanced Theory and Simulations,10.1063/1.5089576
Searching for low-cost LixMOy compounds for compensating Li-loss in sintering of Li-Garnet solid electrolyte,"© 2019 The Chinese Ceramic SocietyCubic Li-Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO) is one of the promising solid-state electrolyte candidates for the next generation high safety solid-state batteries. However, preparing the electrolyte has many challenges. Li-loss during high temperature sintering is one of them. Mother powder with the same component of green garnet pellets is often used to co-fire with the pellets to compensate the Li-loss. Due to the high weight ratio of rare earth element La and non-recyclability of mother powder, it is worthy to explore low-cost mother powders to replace them. In this paper, low cost compounds such as Li5AlO4, Li2TiO3, Li2SiO3, Li4SiO4 and (Li2O)x-(ZrO2)1-x (x = 0.6–0.8) are investigated for substitution of the mother powder for compensating Li-loss during the sintering of LLZO. Dense Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) samples have been prepared by sintering with (Li2O)0.733(ZrO2)0.267 powder at 1150 °C for 5 h with the relative density of 95% and conductivity of 5.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, which show same performance with LLZTO ceramics sintered with LLZO mother powder.",Journal of Materiomics,10.1021/acsami.9b02537
Toward understanding the anomalous Li diffusion in inorganic solid electrolytes by studying a single-crystal garnet of LLZO-Ta by pulsed-gradient spin-echo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,"© 2019 Author(s).Li diffusion was observed by 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in three single-crystal samples of LLZO-Ta (Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12) grown by the floating zone melting method as well as a crushed sample in this study. Previously, the pulsed-gradient spin-echo 7Li NMR method was applied to Li+ diffusion measurements in inorganic solid electrolyte powder samples. Anomalous Li+ diffusion behaviors were observed such as dependence of the observing time (Δ) and pulsed-field-gradient strength (g), and the diffusive-diffraction patterns in short Δin the echo-attenuation plots. In the powder samples, it is uncertain that the Li ions diffuse in the bulk within grain, across grains, or both. To date, the origins of the anomalous Li+ diffusion have not yet been clearly understood. From models of atomic-level lithium pathways, the micrometer-space diffusion channels are assumed to be narrow with curvatures. In contrast to the powder samples, a single crystal is supposed to be uniform without grain boundaries and the Li ions in single-crystal samples can diffuse in the bulk with negligible effects from the surface. The single-crystal samples are expected to give us proper answers. We found that the 7Li echo-attenuation plots of the single-crystal samples showed anomalous phenomena in dependence on Δand g with much reduced manners. We found that the phenomena are inherent characteristics of Li+ diffusion in inorganic solid electrolytes. From the aspects of Li+ carrier numbers, the fast divergent Li+ diffusion constants, observed at short Δwith small g, contribute importantly to the electrochemical high ionic conduction measured by impedance spectroscopy.",Journal of Chemical Physics,10.1088/1757-899X/490/6/062015
Toward a Fundamental Understanding of the Lithium Metal Anode in Solid-State Batteries - An Electrochemo-Mechanical Study on the Garnet-Type Solid Electrolyte Li 6.25 Al 0.25 La 3 Zr 2 O 12,"© Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society. For the development of next-generation lithium batteries, major research effort is made to enable a reversible lithium metal anode by the use of solid electrolytes. However, the fundamentals of the solid-solid interface and especially the processes that take place under current load are still not well characterized. By measuring pressure-dependent electrode kinetics, we explore the electrochemo-mechanical behavior of the lithium metal anode on the garnet electrolyte Li 6.25 Al 0.25 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 . Because of the stability against reduction in contact with the lithium metal, this serves as an optimal model system for kinetic studies without electrolyte degradation. We show that the interfacial resistance becomes negligibly small and converges to practically 0 ω·cm 2 at high external pressures of several 100 MPa. To the best of our knowledge, this is the smallest reported interfacial resistance in the literature without the need for any interlayer. We interpret this observation by the concept of constriction resistance and show that the contact geometry in combination with the ionic transport in the solid electrolyte dominates the interfacial contributions for a clean interface in equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that - under anodic operating conditions - the vacancy diffusion limitation in the lithium metal restricts the rate capability of the lithium metal anode because of contact loss caused by vacancy accumulation and the resulting pore formation near the interface. Results of a kinetic model show that the interface remains morphologically stable only when the anodic load does not exceed a critical value of approximately 100 μA·cm -2 , which is not high enough for practical cell setups employing a planar geometry. We highlight that future research on lithium metal anodes on solid electrolytes needs to focus on the transport within and the morphological instability of the metal electrode. Overall, the results help to develop a deeper understanding of the lithium metal anode on solid electrolytes, and the major conclusions are not limited to the Li|Li 6.25 Al 0.25 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 interface.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1088/1757-899X/490/6/062004

"An investigation on strength distribution, subcritical crack growth and lifetime of the lithium-ion conductor Li7La3Zr2O12","© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Due to the good chemical stability regarding lithium and cathode materials under high voltage, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is considered as a promising electrolyte in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. However, to enable stable long-term operation, knowledge of the mechanical boundary conditions is required. Since mechanical properties of the components and cells depend on the microstructure, the micro- and macro-mechanical properties of LLZO were investigated systemically via indentation tests and ring-on-ring bending (ROR) tests. Hence, fracture stress, elastic modulus, hardness and indentation fracture toughness of the material were characterized under different applied loads. Additionally, room-temperature subcritical crack growth effects were studied on the basis of loading rate-dependent ROR test derived data in order to assess potential reliability issues of LLZO components under application-relevant conditions. A strength–probability–lifetime plot is derived on the basis of these fracture stress data. Complementary optical and electron microscopic investigations were carried out. The Weibull modulus of LLZO is 6, and the stress should not exceed 21 MPa for a lifetime of 3 years to warrant a failure probability of 1%.",Journal of Materials Science,10.1021/acsami.8b21770
High Li-ion conductivity of Al-free Li 7-3x Ga x La 3 Zr 2 O 12 solid electrolyte prepared by liquid-phase sintering,"© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Ga-doped Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (Ga-LLZO) is a promising solid electrolyte because it shows higher Li-ion conductivity than LLZO doped with other cations. In this work, Ga-LLZO was prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction and sintered in ZrO 2 crucibles to avoid introducing Al into the samples. The particle size distribution, phase structure, morphology, ionic conductivity, and bulk density of the samples were characterized by laser diffraction particle size analyzer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), AC impedance, and Archimedes method, respectively. The effects of sintering temperature and dopant content on Li-ion conductivity and density were investigated. As for Al-free Li 6.4 Ga 0.2 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 , the Li-ion conductivity and bulk density are improved with the sintering temperature rise. But when the sintering temperature is 1250 °C, the Li-ion conductivity and bulk density decline. As for Al-free Li 7-3x Ga x La 3 Zr 2 O 12 , the tetragonal phase disappears completely when x ≥ 0.15. The Li-ion conductivity and bulk density of Al-free Li 7-3x Ga x La 3 Zr 2 O 12 are improved with an increase of x (x ≤ 0.2). The ionic conductivity of Al-free Li 7-3x Ga x La 3 Zr 2 O 12 sintered in the air by liquid-phase sintering is close to Ga-LLZO sintered in dry O 2 atmosphere. Li 6.4 Ga 0.2 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 sintered at 1200 °C shows the highest Li-ion conductivity of 1.5 × 10 −3 S/cm at 30 °C, and the activation energy is about 0.28 eV.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry,10.1039/c8ee03390k
Improving Ionic Conductivity with Bimodal-Sized Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 Fillers for Composite Polymer Electrolytes,"© 2019 American Chemical Society. Ceramic-polymer composite electrolytes (CPEs) are being explored to achieve both high ionic conductivity and mechanical flexibility. Here, we show that, by incorporating 10 wt % (3 vol %) mixed-sized fillers of Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO) doped with Nb/Al, the roomerature ionic conductivity of a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-LiClO 4 -based composite can be as high as 2.6 × 10 -4 S/cm, which is 1 order of magnitude higher than that with nano- or micrometer-sized LLZO particles as fillers. The CPE also shows a high lithium-ion transference number of 0.682, a stable and low Li/CPE interfacial resistance, and good mechanical properties favorable for all-solid-state lithium-ion battery applications. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman analysis demonstrate that the LLZO fillers of all sizes interact with PVDF and LiClO 4 . High packing density (i.e., lower porosity) and long conducting pathways are believed responsible for the excellent performance of the composite electrolyte filled with mixed-sized ionically conducting ceramic particles.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.8b19237
In situ formation of a bifunctional interlayer enabled by a conversion reaction to initiatively prevent lithium dendrites in a garnet solid electrolyte,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Adopting inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) is a promising approach to assemble batteries using Li metal anodes because of their superior Li-ion conductivity and high mechanical strength. This approach greatly improves the energy density and the safety of batteries. However, lithium dendrites still can pierce the bare ISE because of inhomogeneous current distributions at interfaces, leading to serious short circuits. This work proposes to reduce the interfacial resistance and prevent lithium dendrite growth simultaneously through in situ formation of interlayers enabled by a conversion reaction of MoS2 layers coated on a bare Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZO) pellet. The interfacial resistance is reduced to only 14 Ω cm2, with the overpotential decreasing notably. The critical current density of cells is improved from 0.7 mA cm-2 to 2.2 mA cm-2. Furthermore, short circuits are significantly suppressed above the critical current density with the potential diverging quickly. The cell can be recovered to some extent by applying an inverse potential for a short time. The comparison between XPS and XAS measurements reveals that the nanoscale thin MoS2 layer in contact with the Li anode can be converted into an interlayer composed of Mo and Li2S through the conversion reaction. The sluggish kinetics of the conversion reaction resulting from the poor electronic conductivity makes the in situ-formed interlayer kinetically stable, which can hinder further reaction of MoS2 with Li effectively. Moreover, the in situ reaction could suppress the local tip electric field effect efficiently and make the current distribution more even. This study provides a new strategy to optimize the interface of anodes by screening for more candidates which undergo a conversion reaction.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1002/aenm.201803440
Space-Charge Effects at the Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 /Poly(ethylene oxide) Interface,"© 2019 American Chemical Society. Composites consisting of garnet-type Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO) ceramic particles dispersed in a solid polymer electrolyte based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) have recently been investigated as a possible electrolyte material in all solid state Li ion batteries. The interface between the two materials, that is, LLZO/PEO, is of special interest for the transport of lithium ions in the composite. For obtaining the desired high ionic conductivity, Li + ions have to pass easily across this interface. However, previous research found that the interface is highly resistive. Here, we further investigate the interface between Al-substituted LLZO and PEO-LiClO 4 electrolytes in the frame of a theoretical description, which is based on space-charge layers. By theoretical calculations supported by experiments, we find that the interface is highly resistive. From the results, we have deduced that the highest contribution to this resistance comes from a high activation energy and not from electrostatic repulsion of lithium.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsaem.8b01850
Dopant-Dependent Stability of Garnet Solid Electrolyte Interfaces with Lithium Metal,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO) garnet-based materials doped with Al, Nb, or Ta to stabilize the Li + -conductive cubic phase are a particularly promising class of solid electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. Understanding of the intrinsic reactivity between solid electrolytes and relevant electrode materials is crucial to developing high voltage solid-state batteries with long lifetimes. Using a novel, surface science-based approach to characterize the intrinsic reactivity of the Li–solid electrolyte interface, it is determined that, surprisingly, some degree of Zr reduction takes place for all three dopant types, with the extent of reduction increasing as Ta < Nb < Al. Significant reduction of Nb also takes place for Nb-doped LLZO, with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of Li||Nb–LLZO||Li symmetric cells further revealing significant increases in impedance with time and suggesting that the Nb reduction propagates into the bulk. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Nb-doped material shows a strong preference for Nb dopants toward the interface between LLZO and Li, while Ta does not exhibit a similar preference. EIS and DFT results, coupled with the observed reduction of Zr at the interface, are consistent with the formation of an “oxygen-deficient interphase” (ODI) layer whose structure determines the stability of the LLZO–Li interface.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2018.11.026
Garnet-Polymer Composite Electrolytes: New Insights on Local Li-Ion Dynamics and Electrodeposition Stability with Li Metal Anodes,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Ceramic-polymer solid electrolytes, combined with Li metal anodes, hold the promise for safer and more energetically dense battery technologies, as long as key interfacial challenges are fully understood and solved. Here, we investigate a garnet-PEO(LiTFSI) composite electrolyte system, the garnet filler being Li6.55Ga0.15La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) microparticles. A ""soft"" mechanical milling process ensures good miscibility between the garnet and polymer phases over a wide range of volume fraction (up to 70 vol % garnet). Excellent degree of structural and chemical homogeneity is achieved without degradation nor segregation, even at the local level, as confirmed by solid-state NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy and gel permeation chromatography. The total Li-ion conductivity of the composites is governed by the polymer matrix, as a consequence of the high interfacial resistance (∼104 ω cm2) between the garnet particles and the PEO(LiTFSI) matrix. However, by using 7Li NMR 2D exchange spectroscopy (ESXY) in the solid state, it is shown that Li ions can locally exchange between the garnet surfaces to the surrounding polymer chains. This dynamic transfer phenomenon, occurring within the composite, seems to play a key role in kinetically stabilizing the interface with Li metal electrode, as observed from galvanostatic cycling and EIS experiments. Comparison of a garnet-free PEO electrolyte with a PEO-garnet (10 vol %) composite shows key performance improvements in the latter: although the Li-ion conductivity at 70 °C slightly decreases from 7.0 × 10-4S cm-1, for PEO-LiTFSI, to 4.5 × 10-4 S cm-1 for 10 vol % LLZO, the composite shows up to 1 order of magnitude lower interfacial resistance with Li metal electrode (33 vs 300 ω cm2), stable Li electrodeposition, and no dendrite formation. In contrast to previously believed, it is demonstrated that these improvements are not related to a change of the mechanical behavior but rather to a structural reorganization in the composite followed by local ion dynamics effects at the vicinity of the Li metal interface.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1039/c8ee02981d
Mg-doping towards enhancing the composition-phase-structural stability of Li-La-zirconate based cubic garnet upon exposure to air,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdMg, as a new dopant, has been found to stabilize the desired cubic garnet structure (Ia3¯d) of Li-La-zirconate (LLZO) and lead to Li-ion conductivities similar to those obtained with the same level of Al-doping. More importantly, Mg-doping, as opposed to Al-doping, suppresses the deleterious reactions with the atmospheric moisture/CO2, leading to stability in the composition-phase-structure upon exposure to air. Accordingly, when exposed to air, even though Al-doped LLZO pellets get spontaneously fractured/disintegrated, accompanied by reduction in ionic conductivity by ~3 orders of magnitude, Mg-doped LLZO shows no sign of cracking and almost retains the ionic conductivity measured prior to exposure.",Scripta Materialia,10.1038/s41560-018-0312-z
Elucidating the mobility of H+ and Li+ ions in (Li6.25-: XHxAl0.25)La3Zr2O12 via correlative neutron and electron spectroscopy,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.A major challenge toward realizing high-performance aqueous lithium batteries (ALBs) is the utilization of a metallic lithium anode. However, an ideal solid electrolyte that can protect metallic lithium from reacting with aqueous solutions while still maintaining a high lithium ion conduction is not currently available. One obstacle is the lack of a reliable experimental tool to differentiate the conduction behaviour of H+ and Li+ ions in a solid electrolyte. Here, by correlating neutron and electron spectroscopy, we quantitatively reveal the mobility and lattice occupancy of the two ions individually in protonated cubic Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). Our results not only highlight LLZO as a potential effective separation layer for ALBs but also present a robust method to quantify the mobility of individual mobile ions in solid-state ion conductors.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1016/j.ensm.2018.08.021
High electronic conductivity as the origin of lithium dendrite formation within solid electrolytes,"© 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited. Solid electrolytes (SEs) are widely considered as an ‘enabler’ of lithium anodes for high-energy batteries. However, recent reports demonstrate that the Li dendrite formation in Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO) and Li 2 S–P 2 S 5 is actually much easier than that in liquid electrolytes of lithium batteries, by mechanisms that remain elusive. Here we illustrate the origin of the dendrite formation by monitoring the dynamic evolution of Li concentration profiles in three popular but representative SEs (LiPON, LLZO and amorphous Li 3 PS 4 ) during lithium plating using time-resolved operando neutron depth profiling. Although no apparent changes in the lithium concentration in LiPON can be observed, we visualize the direct deposition of Li inside the bulk LLZO and Li 3 PS 4 . Our findings suggest the high electronic conductivity of LLZO and Li 3 PS 4 is mostly responsible for dendrite formation in these SEs. Lowering the electronic conductivity, rather than further increasing the ionic conductivity of SEs, is therefore critical for the success of all-solid-state Li batteries.",Nature Energy,10.1111/jace.15938
Enabling room-temperature solid-state lithium-metal batteries with fluoroethylene carbonate-modified plastic crystal interlayers,"© 2018Solid-state batteries (SSBs) with Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramic oxide electrolytes are attracting significant interest because of LLZO's non-flammability, excellent ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability against Li metal anodes, and processability in air. However, the poor solid-solid contact between the electrolyte and the electrodes leads to large interfacial impedances, which are detrimental to the functioning of LLZO-based SSBs. In this work, we modified the electrode|Ta-doped-LLZO (LLZTO) interfaces by employing a plastic crystal interlayer based on succinonitrile with a fluoroethylene carbonate additive. The interlayer, which can be easily applied, drastically reduces the interfacial resistances and allows the stable operation of Li-metal based batteries. A Li|LLZTO|LiFePO4 battery with this interlayer can stably cycle at room-temperature for 50 times at 0.1 C while still retaining a capacity of 140 mAh g-1. The symmetric Li|LLZTO|Li cell with the interlayer can cycle at 0.2 mA cm-2 for over 150 hours. It also has a higher critical current density for the growth of dendrites compared with an analogous cell without the interlayer. In short, this work provides a facile and efficient methodology to enhance the effective Li transportation rates at the electrode|electrolyte interfaces of SSBs and can be readily applied to other types of electrolytes beyond LLZO.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.11.034
Dense freeze-cast Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolytes with oriented open porosity and contiguous ceramic scaffold,"© 2018 The American Ceramic SocietyFreeze casting is used for the first time to prepare solid electrolyte scaffolds with oriented porosity and dense ceramic walls made of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), one of the most promising candidates for solid-state battery electrolytes. Processing parameters—such as solvent solidification rate, solvent type, and ceramic particle size—are investigated, focusing on their influence on porosity and ceramic wall density. Dendrite-like porosity is obtained when using cyclohexane and dioxane as solvents. Lamellar porosity is observed in aqueous slurries resulting in a structure with the highest apparent porosity and densest ceramic scaffold but weakest mechanical properties due to the lack of interlamellar support. The use of smaller LLZO particle size in the slurries resulted in lower porosity and denser ceramic walls. The intrinsic ionic conductivity of the oriented LLZ ceramic scaffold is unaffected by the freeze casting technique, providing a promising ceramic scaffold for polymer infill in view of designing new types of ceramic-polymer composites.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.11.136
Temperature dependent flux balance of the Li/Li7La3Zr2O12 interface,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe potential for safe, high energy-density Li-ion batteries has motivated the development of the solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) to physically stabilize the Li-electrolyte interface. Although dense LLZO is a relatively hard ceramic, it has been observed that above a certain critical current density (CCD), Li metal can still propagate through both polycrystalline and single crystalline LLZO. However, reported values of CCD are still well below the current density regimes relevant to applications like electric vehicles (≥3 mA cm−2). The relationship between CCD and temperature was studied using recently developed methods for achieving consistently low interfacial impedances without interfacial coatings that can complicate the analysis of what controls interface stability. By analyzing the flux of Li+ ions at the Li-electrolyte interface, it is hypothesized here that solid-state diffusivity of Li in the Li electrode may be a governing mechanism that controls the CCD. These results demonstrate an improvement for dendrite-free cycling in LLZO up to ∼1 mA cm−2 at room temperature and ∼7 mA cm−2 at 100 °C without the need for coatings to achieve low interface resistances (∼10 Ω cm2). Furthermore, the presented analysis may provide additional insight on the role of Li diffusivity in Li propagation through ceramic electrolytes.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.12.008
Synergistic regulation of garnet-type Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte by Li+ concentration and Li+ transport channel size,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe Li+ concentration and Li+ transport channel size of garnet-type solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 are the two key factors associated with the improvement of Li ionic conductivity. Through precise control of the Li+ concentration and the Li+ transport channel size by Ta-doping (Li7-XLa3Zr2-XTaXO12, X = 0.2–1.0), synergistic regulation of the two factors is achieved. Results show that the optimum Li+ concentration seems to be at about 6.31 where the Li+ occupancy in LiO6 is high and the Li+ arrangement in LiO4 is disordering. With the Li+ concentration higher than 6.31, the occupancy in LiO4 sites remains constant but the Li+ arrangement in LiO4 becomes more and more ordering. At higher Li+ concentration of 6.52, Li+ arrangement becomes certain of ordering which should have reduced the grain conductivity, however, the grain conductivity is still as high as 9.84 × 10−4 S cm−1. This indicates that LLZO with this Li+ concentration have favorable Li+ transport channel size. The optimum Li+ transport channel size is about 12.95 ± 0.01 Å. At Li+ concentration of 6.31, the proper Li+ concentration is the main factor for the high grain ionic conductivity of 10.1 × 10−4 S cm−1. While at Li+ concentration of 6.52, the suitable Li+ transport channel size is the main factor for the high grain ionic conductivity. In conclusion, the high grain ionic conductivity at Li+ concentration of 6.31–6.52 is due to the synergistic regulation of Li+ concentration and Li+ transport channel size.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.fusengdes.2018.11.018
Cathode/electrolyte interface engineering via wet coating and hot pressing for all-solid-state lithium battery,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.In this work, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)-based membrane electrolyte, which has good flexibility and can be easily mass-produced, is proposed to address the intrinsic defects of ceramic electrolytes. The LLZO-based membrane electrolyte is electrochemically stable in the voltage range of 0–5.2 V vs. Li/Li+ due to the good oxidative stability of LLZO. We also develop a simple and low-cost approach to fabricate the all-solid-state lithium battery (ASSLB). Wet coating and hot pressing are applied to form a continuous and homogeneous electrolyte layer on a cathode layer. Thanks to the integrated preparation process, there is no obvious interface between the cathode layer and the electrolyte layer, hence reducing the interface resistance. The Li/LiFePO4 batteries exhibit desirable cycling performance at 60 °C, which deliver a maximum discharge specific capacity of 151.6 mAh·g−1 at 0.1C and maintain 97.8% of the capacity after 50 cycles.",Solid State Ionics,10.1016/j.ensm.2018.07.004
Electrochemical extraction of hydrogen isotopes from Li/LiT mixtures,"© 2018In this study, we propose a new methodology for lithium hydride electrolysis which can be extended for the extraction of hydrogen isotopes from molten lithium. This new process utilizes a ceramic lithium ion conductor that can be directly immersed in molten lithium to facilitate the electrochemical extraction of hydrogen isotopes in the molten state. The extraction of hydrogen isotopes from lithium is necessary for the safe and reliable operation of fusion reactors that utilize molten metals as a coolant and/or as tritium breeder blanket in the system. A number of technologies for hydrogen isotope extraction from molten lithium have been proposed that can facilitate the extraction of hydrogen isotopes. However, they require a series of complicated mechanical steps (expensive mechanical parts with limited lifetimes) in order to carry out the separation and prevent impurities build up in the extraction process. Our proposed electrochemical process can potentially simplify the isotope extraction process by eliminating many of the mechanical parts and being able to integrate this technology within the fusion reactor to perform the extraction in-line. To determine the feasibility of this process, a proof of concept was demonstrated experimentally utilizing a solid state lithium ion conductor to facilitate the electrochemical extraction of hydrogen and deuterium from lithium in the molten state. The extraction of hydrogen and deuterium from molten lithium was verified during this experiment and indicates this new process is a potential alternative for other processes used for the extraction of hydrogen isotopes. Process modeling was also performed to understand the energy requirements and electrode areas needed for decomposing different concentrations of tritium.",Fusion Engineering and Design,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b10694
Solid polymer electrolyte soft interface layer with 3D lithium anode for all-solid-state lithium batteries,"© 2018Garnet electrolyte-based lithium (Li) metal batteries, which employ garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) as electrolyte and Li metal as anode, are regarded as a promising candidate for high-energy batteries. However, Li dendrites formation as well as poor solid-solid contact between the electrolyte and electrodes result in high interfacial resistance, large polarizations, and low Coulombic efficiency. Herein, we demonstrated that solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) soft interface layer deposited on garnet electrolyte (Ta-doped LLZO (LLZTO)) surface along with 3D Li metal anode can address these obstacles. In this architecture, SPE layer was deposited on garnet electrolyte surface to endow connected interface between the electrolyte and electrodes and thus settled the interface contact issue. 3D Li metal anode can accomplish dendrite-suppression by increasing Li ions deposition sites to lower the effective current density and render a uniform Li nucleation with 3D frameworks. With this ingenious arrangement, the solid-state 3D Li︱SPE-LLZTO-SPE︱3D Li symmetrical cell exhibits a stable voltage profile over 700 h and solid-state LiFePO4︱SPE-LLZTO-SPE︱3D Li full cell also shows an extremely superior cyclability and high Coulombic efficiency even at 90 °C. This work provides an alternative option for manufacturing safe and stable solid-state Li metal batteries.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1021/acsami.8b17217
Proton Bulk Diffusion in Cubic Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 Garnets as Probed by Single X-ray Diffraction,"© 2018 American Chemical Society. Ceramic electrolytes, characterized by a very high ionic conductivity as it is the case for Al-stabilized cubic Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (Al:LLZO), are of utmost interest to develop next-generation batteries that can efficiently store electrical energy from renewable sources. If envisaged not as a solid electrolyte but as a protecting layer in lithium-metal batteries with liquid electrolytes, the ceramic should allow Li + to pass through but block out other species such as H + . Protons, for example, originating from the decomposition of electrolyte solvent molecules, will form detrimental LiH that severely affects the performance and lifetime of such batteries. Although Li-ion dynamics in Al:LLZO has been the topic of many studies, until today, little information is available about macroscopic proton diffusion in LLZO. Here, we used single-crystal X-ray diffraction to study the Li + /H + exchange rate in AL:LLZO over a period of about 3 years. Rietveld refinements reveal that H solely exchanges on the 96h site. The Li/H portion significantly changes from the anhydrous pristine sample to Li 4.21 :H 0.66 after 17 days of altering in humid air and finally to Li 2.55 :H 2.32 after 960 days. Considering the change of the Li/H portion and the probing depth of X-rays into Al:LLZO, we applied a spherical diffusion model to estimate the proton diffusion coefficient of D 0 â‰ 10 -17 m 2 s -1 . Such a proton diffusion coefficient value is sufficiently high to have significant impact on cell performance and safety if Al:LLZO is going to be used to protect the Li-metal anode from reaction with the liquid electrolyte. In particular, during Li plating, such a high H + penetration rate may accelerate the formation of LiH, giving rise to safety problems of these types of batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acsami.8b18356
Atomistic Insight into Ion Transport and Conductivity in Ga/Al-Substituted Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 Solid Electrolytes,"© 2018 American Chemical Society. Garnet-structured Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 is a promising solid electrolyte for next-generation solid-state Li batteries. However, sufficiently fast Li-ion mobility required for battery applications only emerges at high temperatures, upon a phase transition to cubic structure. A well-known strategy to stabilize the cubic phase at room temperature relies on aliovalent substitution; in particular, the substitution of Li + by Al 3+ and Ga 3+ ions. Yet, despite having the same formal charge, Ga 3+ substitution yields higher conductivities (10 -3 S/cm) than Al 3+ (10 -4 S/cm). The reason of such difference in ionic conductivity remains a mystery. Here, we use molecular dynamic simulations and advanced sampling techniques to precisely unveil the atomistic origin of this phenomenon. Our results show that Li + vacancies generated by Al 3+ and Ga 3+ substitution remain adjacent to Ga 3+ and Al 3+ ions, without contributing to the promotion of Li + mobility. However, while Ga 3+ ions tend to allow limited Li + diffusion within their immediate surroundings, the less repulsive interactions associated with Al 3+ ions lead to a complete blockage of neighboring Li + diffusion paths. This effect is magnified at lower temperatures and explains the higher conductivities observed for Ga-substituted systems. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight into the fundamental ion transport mechanism in the bulk of Ga/Al-substituted Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 and paves the way for rationalizing aliovalent substitution design strategies for enhancing ionic transport in these materials.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1088/1361-6463/aaf7e2
In Situ Formed Shields Enabling Li 2 CO 3 -Free Solid Electrolytes: A New Route to Uncover the Intrinsic Lithiophilicity of Garnet Electrolytes for Dendrite-Free Li-Metal Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society. Introduction of inorganic solid electrolytes is believed to be an ultimate strategy to dismiss dendritic Li in high-energy Li-metal batteries (LMBs), and garnet-type Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO) electrolytes are impressive candidates. However, the current density for stable Li plating/stripping in LLZO is still quite limited. Here, we create in situ formed Li-deficient shields by the high-temperature calcination at 900 °C. By this novel process, the formation of Li 2 CO 3 on LLZO is restrained, and then we successfully obtain Li 2 CO 3 -free LLZO after removing the Li-deficient compounds. Without any surface modification, Li 2 CO 3 -free LLZO shows an intrinsic ""lithiophilicity"" characteristic. The contact angles of metallic Li on LLZO garnets are assessed by the first-principle calculation to confirm the lithiophilicity characteristic of LLZO electrolytes. The wetting of metallic Li on the Li 2 CO 3 -free LLZO surface leads to a continuous and tight Li/LLZO interface, resulting in an ultralow interfacial resistance of 49 ω cm 2 and a homogeneous current distribution in the charge/discharge processes of LMBs. Consequently, the current density for the stable Li plating/stripping in LLZO increases to 900 μA cm -2 at 60 °C, one of the highest current density for LMBs based on garnet-type LLZO electrolytes. Our findings not only offer insight into the lithiophilicity characteristics of LLZO electrolytes to suppress dendritic Li at high current densities but also expand the avenue toward high-performance, safe, and long-life energy-storage systems.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1002/adfm.201805301
Recent progress for all solid state battery using sulfide and oxide solid electrolytes,"© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All solid state batteries (ASSB) have been researched by many groups in order to realize safe and high energy density rechargeable batteries. There are mainly two types of inorganic electrolytes used for ASSB: sulfides and oxides. We will review the recent advances in ASSB with oxide electrolytes. At first, the status of solid electrolytes will be discussed from the viewpoints of Li + conductivity, chemical and electrochemical stability and compatibility with Li metal anode. In practical, the garnet electrolyte Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO), widely regarded as the most promising solid electrolyte, will be focused. Second, since it is very difficult to attach electrode layers to a LLZO pellet due to its surface nature, some deposition techniques, e.g. chemical vapor deposition and physical vapor deposition, are used for electrode fabrication. Here, a new aerosol deposition technique to deposit cathode layer onto LLZO electrolyte is introduced. In addition, the wettability between LLZO and the most promising anode material, Li metal, is discussed. Finally, we would like to discuss the internal short circuit problem of ASSB due to Li metal penetration through LLZO pellet during charge and discharge processes. The understanding of this phenomenon is very important to realize practical ASSBs.",Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics,10.1016/j.matpr.2020.01.142
Low Resistance–Integrated All-Solid-State Battery Achieved by Li7La3Zr2O12 Nanowire Upgrading Polyethylene Oxide (PEO) Composite Electrolyte and PEO Cathode Binder,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAll-solid-state lithium metal battery is the most promising next-generation energy storage device. However, the low ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes and high interfacial impedance with electrode are the main factors to limit the development of all-solid-state batteries. In this work, a low resistance–integrated all-solid-state battery is designed with excellent electrochemical performance that applies the polyethylene oxide (PEO) with lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide as both binder of cathode and matrix of composite electrolyte embedded with Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) nanowires (PLLN). The PEO in cathode and PLLN are fused at high temperature to form an integrated all-solid-state battery structure, which effectively strengthens the interface compatibility and stability between cathode and PLLN to guarantee high efficient ion transportation during long cycling. The LLZO nanowires uniformly distributed in PLLN can increase the ionic conductivity and mechanical strength of composite electrolyte efficiently, which induces the uniform deposition of lithium metal, thereby suppressing the lithium dendrite growth. The Li symmetric cells using PLLN can stably cycle for 1000 h without short circuit at 60 °C. The integrated LiFePO4/PLLN/Li batteries show excellent cycling stability at both 60 and 45 °C. The study proposed a novel and robust battery structure with outstanding electrochemical properties.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1088/2053-1591/ab62ef

Microwave assisted reactive sintering for Al doped Li7La3Zr2O12 lithium ion solid state electrolyte,"© 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.Li6.28Al0.24La3Zr2O12 (Al-LLZO) solid electrolyte for Li-ion battery was prepared by a microwave-Assisted reactive sintering (MARS) method. When sintered by the MARS method, the Al-LLZO cubic phase formed at 1000 °C, which is 100 °C lower than that in a conventional furnace sintering method. With the increase of sintering temperature and holding time in MARS, the relative density of Al-LLZO samples goes up. Also, the improved conductivity is related to the decrease of pore number between Al-LLZO grains. And the reduced grain boundary resistivity contributes the most to total reduced resistivity compared with the grain resistivity. The Li-ion conductivity of the Al-LLZO samples prepared by MARS at 1200 °C for 3 h reaches 1.06 × 10-4 s cm-1 at 25 °C and the value of conduction activation energy is 0.36 eV at 25-150 °C.",Materials Research Express,10.1039/c9ta05118j
Densification of Ta-doped garnet-type Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 solid electrolyte materials by sintering in a lithium-rich air atmosphere,"© The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has attracted much attention because it shows promising properties for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries. A dense microstructure is needed to obtain a high Li+ conductivity, as porous microstructures result in much lower Li+ conductivities. In this work, tantalum-doped cubic garnet-type Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LLZTO) with a relative density of 92% was prepared by a simple co-precipitation method with cold uniaxial pressing and sintering in a lithium-rich air atmosphere, which was created by the addition of LiOH to the LLZTO cover powder. This LiOH-containing cover powder (15Li + LiOH) has been shown to improve densification and increase the room temperature total conductivity to 6.9 × 10-4 S/cm with an activation energy of 0.2 eV. This 15Li + LiOH cover powder results in the formation of an Al-containing interparticle phase, which facilitates the densification of LLZTO.

Visualizing percolation and ion transport in hybrid solid electrolytes for Li-metal batteries,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.Hybrid solid electrolytes are composed of organic (polymer) and inorganic (ceramic) ion conducting materials, and are promising options for large-scale production of solid state lithium-metal batteries. Hybrid solid electrolytes containing 15 vol% Al-LLZO demonstrate optimal ionic conductivity properties. Ionic conductivity is shown to decrease at high inorganic loadings. This optimum is most obvious above the melting temperature of polyethylene oxide where the polymer is amorphous. Structural analysis using synchrotron nanotomography reveals that the inorganic particles are highly aggregated. The aggregation size grows with inorganic content and the largest percolating clusters measured for 5 vol%, 15 vol% and 50 vol% were ∼12 μm3, 206 μm3, and 324 μm3, respectively. Enhanced transport in hybrid electrolytes is shown to be due to polymer|particle (Al-LLZO) interactions and ionic conductivity is directly related to the accessible surface area of the inorganic particles within the electrolyte. Ordered and well-dispersed structures are ideal for next generation hybrid solid electrolytes.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1149/2.1171913jes

However, the inadequate contact between LLZO and lithium anode results in high interfacial impedance, which hinders the commercial application of LLZO.

Synergistic enhancement effects of LLZO fibers and interfacial modification for polymer solid electrolyte on the ambient-temperature electrochemical performances of solid-state battery,"© 2019 The Electrochemical Society.The low ionic conductivity of solid electrolyte and the poor interfacial compatibility with lithium anode are often restrain the electrochemical performances of the solid-state battery at ambient temperature. Herein, we for the first time applied electrospun Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) fibers and graphite coating simultaneously on polymer solid electrolyte (SE). The composite SE shows uniform composite structure, possesses a high potential window exceeding 4.6V and a high ionic conductivity of 1.59 × 10−4 S/cm at ambient temperature. The assembled LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622)/SE/Li solid-state battery shows enhanced ambient-temperature electrochemical performance with an initial discharge capacity of 162.6 mAh/g and a retention capacity of 106.1 mAh/g after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.3C. While at 1C, the solid battery were still charged/discharged for 200 cycles with a retention capacity of 100.3 mAh/g. The enhanced ambient-temperature electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of LLZO fibers and graphite coating modification for the composite SE, fibrous fast ion-conductors provide continuous ion transport channels, and graphite modification on the electrolyte surface improves the interface contact with lithium anode and restrains lithium dendrites. This design method for composite polymer solid electrolyte is expected to be popular in solid-state battery with high ambient-temperature performance.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1149/2.0321910jes
Microstrain and electrochemical performance of garnet solid electrolyte integrated in a hybrid battery cell,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Garnet type solid electrolytes are promising candidates for replacing the flammable liquid electrolytes conventionally used in Li-ion batteries. Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is synthesized using nebulized spray pyrolysis and field assisted sintering technology (FAST), a novel synthesis route ensuring the preparation of samples with a homogeneous elemental distribution and dense ceramic electrolytes. Ceramic preparation utilizing field assisted sintering, in particular the applied pressure, has significant influence on the material structure, i.e. microstrain, and thereby its electrochemical performance. The phenomenon of microstrain enhancement of electrochemical performance might open a new route towards improved garnet solid electrolytes. A detailed mechanism is proposed for the lattice distortion and resulting microstrain during sintering. The charge transfer resistance of Li-ions at the interface between LLZO and Li is characterized using AC impedance spectroscopy and is amongst the best reported values to date.

Mechanical stress induced current focusing and fracture in grain boundaries,"© 2019 The Electrochemical Society.Solid state electrolytes (SSEs) with garnet structures and chemical composition Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) are being actively considered as the electrolyte for next-generation lithium ion batteries. These LLZO-based ceramic SSEs are polycrystalline and possess distinct grain-interior/grain-boundary (GI/GB) microstructure. Lithium dendrite growth through these GI and GB domains is considered to be the largest bottleneck preventing their successful implementation. Dendrite growth has been observed to occur predominantly within the GB regions. While this would be expected if the GB regions were more ionically conductive than the GI regions, there is significant disagreement over the relative conductivities of these two regions. The present work demonstrates that dendrite growth can occur preferentially in the GB regions even when the GI regions have higher ionic conductivity. Electrochemical potential changes induced by mechanical stress within the GI and GB domains reveals that the magnitude of effective stress induced current density within the elastically softer GB is larger than in the mechanically stiffer GI, which leads to enhanced lithium deposition in GB and subsequent dendrite growth. The present work additionally examines the impact of applied current density and grain size on current focusing in the GB regions, and also finds that SSE fractures initiate from the GB regions.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1039/c9cp03884a

Dendrite nucleation in lithium-conductive ceramics,"© 2019 the Owner Societies.Solid-state lithium batteries cannot achieve reasonable power densities because of dendrites, whose formation mechanisms remain uncertain. This paper applies principles of chemomechanics to investigate the critical current above which dendrites form in lithium-conductive ceramics. Applied voltage induces stress in solid electrolytes; dendrites appear to nucleate in the exemplary garnet-oxide material Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) when the interfacial pressure exceeds a particular value. The critical pressure of polycrystalline LLZO correlates well with the surface-energy changes incurred by lithium plating in its grain boundaries. A derived formula, validated by experiments, predicts quantitatively how critical current varies with properties including interfacial impedance, bulk permittivity, and grain size. As well as suggesting novel strategies to create more resilient ion-conductive ceramics, the proposed mechanism rationalizes experimental observations of bulk lithium plating and explains how LLZO exhibits an electrically activated transition from stable low-current cyclability to high-current dendrite nucleation.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1039/c9ta06748e
Consolidating the grain boundary of the garnet electrolyte LLZTO with Li3BO3 for high-performance LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/LiFePO4 hybrid solid batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.All solid-state batteries have received significant attention due to their excellent safety performance. As a key component, the garnet-type electrolyte is one of the best known electrolytes due to its air stability and good compatibility with metallic lithium. However, the total Li+ conductivity of this kind of electrolyte is usually lower than that of the bulk electrolyte primarily due to the grain boundary resistance. In this study, we focused on engineering the electrolyte Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) by introducing Li3BO3 (LBO) into it to form the electrolyte LLZTO/LBO with the aim to consolidate the grain boundary. Via characterization by both neutron and X-ray diffraction, the as-prepared LLZTO was indexed as a pure cubic phase, where Ta certainly substituted the Zr sites. LLZTO/LBO still maintained the cubic structure, and the B atoms did not occupy any cation sites in the unit cell. It was demonstrated that an amorphous phase of a boracic substance was trapped inside the cubic LLZTO phase. The amorphous boracic phase sutured the gaps among the LLZTO grains and then lowered the grain boundary resistance without introducing impurities, ultimately consolidating the solid-state electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the total Li+ conductivity of LLZTO/LBO reached 5.47 × 10-4 S cm-1, much higher than those of the as-prepared Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and LLZTO. Using LLZTO/LBO as an electrolyte, the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/LiFePO4 hybrid solid battery showed an excellent cycling performance with the reversible capacity of 147.8 mA h g-1 at 0.2C for 100 cycles and the capacity retention of 93.8%. These results suggest that the consolidation of the grain boundary with LBO is a promising way to achieve an improved electrolyte, LLZO, with higher total Li+ conductivity.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta04841c
Rationalizing the interphase stability of Lidoped-Li7La3Zr2O12: Via automated reaction screening and machine learning,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium metal batteries are a promising candidate for future high-energy-density energy storage. However, dendrite growth and the high reactivity of the Li metal anode result in low cycling efficiency and severe safety concerns. Here, we present a strategy to stabilize the lithium metal anode through cation doping in Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZOM, M = dopant). High-throughput automated reaction screening together with a machine learning approach are developed to evaluate possible reactions and the thermodynamic stability of the LiLLZOM interfaces under various chemical conditions. It is discovered that some dopants, such as M = Sc3+ (doping on Zr site), Ce3+ (La or Zr), Ac3+ (La), Y3+ (La or Zr), Tm3+ (La or Zr), Er3+ (La or Zr), Ho3+ (La or Zr), Dy3+ (La or Zr), Nd3+ (La or Zr), Tb3+ (La or Zr), Pr3+ (La), Pm3+ (La or Zr), Sm3+ (La or Zr), Gd3+ (La or Zr), Lu3+ (La), Ce4+ (Zr), Th4+ (Zr), and Pa5+ (Zr), exhibit thermodynamic stability against Li; while others, M = Ca2+ (La or Zr), Yb3+ (La), Br3+ (Li), Te4+ (Zr), Se4+ (Zr), S4+ (Zr), Hf4+ (Zr), Cl5+ (Zr), and I5+ (Zr), may lead to the spontaneous formation of a stable, passivating solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Li metal, and alleviate dendritic lithium growth. From the machine learning approach, the formation energy of oxides MxOy emerges as the most crucial feature dominating the route of interface reactions, implying that the M-O bond strength governs the interface stability of the cation-doped LLZOM. The machine learning model then predicts 18 unexplored LLZOM systems, which are all validated in subsequent calculations. Our work offers practical insights for experimentalists into the selection of appropriate dopants in LLZO to stabilize Li metal anodes in solid-state batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta01911a
The critical role of oxygen-evolution kinetics in the electrochemical stability of oxide superionic conductors,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Fast ion-conducting solid electrolytes could potentially overcome two key limitations of liquid electrolytes used in today's battery systems, namely, their flammability and limited electrochemical stability. In addition to high ionic conductivity, achieving a wide electrochemical window (EW) to suppress electronic transport (self-discharge and short circuiting) is particularly challenging. The superionic conductor Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) exhibits a wide EW (>5.0 V) while maintaining a good ionic conductivity of ∼10-4 mS cm-1, and serves as a model for promising superionic conductors. However, the physical origin of its electrochemical stability is not fully understood. Here, density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that a major contribution to the wide EW in LLZO originated from the high-barrier kinetics of electrochemical oxygen evolution. The high reaction barrier is attributed to electron holes occurring above the Fermi level, which is consistent with the high-voltage anionic redox potential. Based on the electron-hole relaxation capacity and polyhedral rigidity, we establish a combined charge and bond distance parameter q/r3 which serves as the design principle for regulating electrochemical stability. Based on this principle, LLZO compounds with Nd3+, In3+, Sb3+, and Y3+ substituted in the Zr4+ site are predicted to have a wider electrochemical window of >5.5 V or even higher. The established anionic electrochemical mechanism for improving the electrochemical stability provides new insight into rationally designing and optimizing electrochemically stable superionic conductors.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.24425/amm.2019.127581
Acid induced conversion towards a robust and lithiophilic interface for Li-Li7La3Zr2O12 solid-state batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Solid-state lithium batteries (SSBs) promise high energy and power densities, as well as enhanced safety, owing to the use of Li metal and nonflammable solid-state electrolytes. In particular, cubic garnet-type Ta-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) is known for its high ionic conductivity and stability against Li metal. However, poor interfacial contact of the Li/LLZO interface is an obstacle that has come to light in the face of more demanding applications. Herein, to tackle this problem, a novel and facile strategy is demonstrated using H3PO4 to react with the Li2CO3/LiOH passivation layer of the LLZTO surface to form a uniform Li3PO4 modification layer. The Li3PO4 layer not only promotes interfacial wettability by reducing the significant difference of the surface energy, but also produces a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to inhibit lithium dendrite penetration. The symmetric cell exhibits a dramatically reduced interfacial resistance of 7.0 Ohm cm2 and ultrastable galvanostatic cycling, over 1600 hours at 0.1 mA cm-2 and over 450 hours at 0.5 mA cm-2. Besides this, hybrid solid-state full cells matched with different cathodes also displayed excellent electrochemical performances. LiFePO4 exhibited stable cycling (∼150 mA h g-1) and a good rate performance. In particular, for a S cathode, the coulombic efficiencies remained higher than 99% over 200 cycles. The use of a ternary NCM523 cathode also confirmed the anodic interfacial stability up to high voltage (4.5 V). Therefore, this facile strategy provides a stepping stone for future applications of solid-state Li-ion and Li-S batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.4191/kcers.2019.56.2.01

The LLZO samples were exposed to 50% humidified air for 48 h. After H2O exposure, a cubic to tetragonal transformation occurred and acquired SEM images exhibited the presence of reaction phases at the grain boundaries of Al and Nb-LLZO. As a result, the lithium ion conductivity significantly decreased after H2O exposure. On the contrary, W-LLZO showed good stability against H2O. Although the cubic to tetragonal transformation was also observed in H2O-exposed W-LLZO, the decrease in lithium ion conductivity was found to be modest.

The tape-casting and PAS sintering of LLZO ceramic membrane electrolyte,"© 2019 The American Ceramic Society.Solid‐state batteries with non‐flammable inorganic solid electrolytes are one candidate to replace the currently‐used liquid electrolyte. The inorganic ceramic solid electrolyte with garnet structure Li7La3Zr2O12, known as LLZO, has been developed, which has several superior advantages, such as high ionic conductivity (10‐4~10‐3S cm‐1) at room temperature, wide electrochemical window (~6V), good chemical stability against Li metal anode. However, the total resistance of thick LLZO solid electrolyte is still too large to be applied in the industry. In order to reduce the resistance and improve the power density of LLZO solid electrolyte, ceramic membranes with micron thickness should be prepared.

The garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte is one of the most promising candidates because of its excellent comprehensively electrochemical performance. Both, experiments and theoretical calculations, show that cubic LLZO has high room-temperature ionic conductivity and good chemical stability while contacting with the lithium anode and most of the cathode materials. In this paper, the crystal structure, Li-ion transport mechanism, preparation method, and element doping of LLZO are introduced in detail based on the research progress in recent years. Then, the development prospects and challenges of LLZO as applied to ASSBs are discussed.",Journal of the Korean Ceramic Society,10.1021/acsami.8b17954
An efficient multi-doping strategy to enhance Li-ion conductivity in the garnet-type solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-ion (Li+) batteries suffer from problems caused by the chemical instability of their organic electrolytes. Solid-state electrolytes that exhibit high ionic conductivities and are stable to lithium metal are potential replacements for flammable organic electrolytes. Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 is a promising solid-state electrolyte for next-generation solid-state Li batteries. In this study, we prepared mono-, dual-, and ternary-doped lithium (Li) garnets by doping tantalum (Ta), tantalum-barium (Ta-Ba), and tantalum-barium-gallium (Ta-Ba-Ga) ions, along with an undoped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) cubic garnet electrolyte, using a conventional solid-state reaction method. The effect of multi-ion doping on the Li+ dynamics in the garnet-type LLZO was studied by combining joint Rietveld refinement against X-ray diffraction and high-resolution neutron powder diffraction analyses with the results of Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and multinuclear magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance. Our results revealed that Li+ occupancy in the tetrahedrally coordinated site (24d) increased with increased multi-ion doping in LLZO, whereas Li+ occupancy in the octahedrally coordinated site (96h) remained constant. Among the investigated compounds, the ternary-doped garnet structure Li6.65Ga0.05La2.95Ba0.05Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LGLBZTO) exhibited the highest total ionic conductivity of 0.72 and 1.24 mS cm-1 at room temperature and 60 °C, respectively. Overall, our findings revealed that the dense microstructure and increased Li+ occupancy in the tetrahedral-24dLi1 site played a key role in achieving the maximum room-temperature Li-ion conductivity in the ternary-doped LGLBZTO garnet, and that the prepared ternary-doped LGLBZTO was a potential solid electrolyte for Li-ion batteries without polymer adhesion.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.245
Li7La3Zr2O12 ceramic nanofiber-incorporated composite polymer electrolytes for lithium metal batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.A composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) based on garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) nanofiber-incorporated PVDF-HFP is reported. The addition of 10 wt% LLZO nanofibers in the developed PVDF-HFP/LiTFSI/LLZO CPE results in an improved ionic conductivity of 9.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, which is due to the 1D structure of LLZO nanofibers providing continuous Li-ion transport pathways. More importantly, this CPE possesses excellent mechanical strength, making it effective in suppressing Li dendrite growth. In addition, the ceramic nanofiber-incorporated CPE shows an enlarged electrochemical window of 5.2 V vs. Li/Li+ in comparison with the one without fillers. Moreover, the cells assembled with this CPE achieve good cycling performance and rate capability. All these favorable features demonstrate that the developed CPE is promising to be used as the electrolyte in the next-generation solid-state Li batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.133
"Microstructure Manipulation for Enhancing the Resistance of Garnet-Type Solid Electrolytes to ""short Circuit"" by Li Metal Anodes","Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society. Al-contained Li 7-x La 3 Zr 2- x Ta x O 12 (xTa-LLZO) powder was synthesized via solid-state reaction, where increasing the Ta doping level was found to reduce the average particle size and facilitate a higher relative density in the sintered pellet. 0.8Ta-LLZO pellets sintered at 1150 °C achieved a relative density of 96.2 ± 0.2% and survived the Li striping/plating test under a unidirectional current polarization of 0.5 mA/cm 2 for more than 8 h without short-circuiting. In contrast, other xTa-LLZO sintered pellets with lower Ta doping levels were short-circuited by lithium dendrites after polarization for much shorter time periods. The microstructure of the sintered body played a more essential role in lithium dendrite prevention compared to relative density alone. By characterizing the microstructure of xTa-LLZO sintered pellets, we proposed a formation mechanism of the pathways for lithium dendrite growth.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsaem.8b01723
High densification and Li-ion conductivity of Al-free Li7-xLa3Zr2-xTaxO12 garnet solid electrolyte prepared by using ultrafine powders,"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Ta-LLZO) is considered as a promising solid electrolyte due to high Li-ion conductivity and good chemical stability against electrode materials. In this work, Ta-LLZO was prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction. Ultrafine powders were obtained by ball-milling to improve the surface activity. Ta-LLZO is sintered in ZrO2 crucibles to avoid introducing Al into the samples. The particle size distribution, phase structure, morphology, ionic conductivity, electronic conductivity, density and electrochemical performance of semi-solid battery were characterized by laser diffraction particle size analyzer, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, AC-impedance, DC polarization, Archimedes method and a battery testing system, respectively. The results show that the ball milling to reduce the particle size is an effective way to solve the problem of relatively low density and Li-ion conductivity for Al-free Li7-xLa3Zr2-xTaxO12. For Al-free Li7-xLa3Zr2-xTaxO12, the increase of x (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) promotes the grain growth and sintering densification, but the increase of x (0.4 < x ≤ 0.6) has an adverse effect. Li6.7La3Zr1.7Ta0.3O12 sintered at 1180 °C for 12 h shows the relative density of 92% and the highest Li-ion conductivity of 1.03 × 10−3 S/cm at 30 °C with the activation energy of about 0.37 eV, while Li6.6La3Zr1.6Ta0.4O12 sintered at 1180 °C for 12 h shows the highest relative density of 96% and the Li-ion conductivity of 6.68 × 10−4 S/cm at 30 °C with the activation energy of about 0.46 eV. The electronic conductivity of Al-free Li7-xLa3Zr2-xTaxO12 is 10−9 S/cm orders of magnitude. The semi-solid battery shows the first discharge capacity of 104.6 mAh/g and 92.5% capacity retention after 20 cycles.",Ceramics International,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b07704
"Sintering, micro-structure and Li+ conductivity of Li7−xLa3Zr2−xNbxO12/MgO (x = 0.2–0.7) Li-Garnet composite ceramics","© 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Nb-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Nb-LLZO) is one of the promising electrolyte candidates in the Li-Garnet family due to its high Li-ion conductivity. The sintered Nb-LLZO ceramics, however, often exhibit abnormal grain growth with high porosity and poor mechanical properties. For advantaged electrochemical and mechanical properties, a uniform and dense microstructure is desired. In this research, MgO has been added as a secondary phase to inhibit abnormal grain growth in Nb-LLZO. The sintering process of the Nb-LLZO/MgO composite ceramics has been studied for different Nb doping levels (0.2–0.7 pfu) at sintering conditions of 1250 °C for 1–360 min. The ceramic density, microstructure, and Li-ion conductivity are reported. The composite ceramics have shown a very fast sintering speed. At 1250 °C, the 0.4Nb-LLZO/MgO composite can be well-sintered in 1 min. For sintering at 1250 °C for 40 min, ceramic samples showing relative density of 97%, conductivity of 6 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, and activation energy of 0.40 eV are obtained.",Ceramics International,10.1021/acsaem.8b01035
Garnet Electrolyte Surface Degradation and Recovery,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Ceramic materials based on the garnet structure Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) show great promise as lithium-ion conducting electrolytes for solid-state lithium batteries. However, these materials exhibit surface degradation when exposed to air and moisture, which adversely impacts their functioning in operating devices. In this work, we use several depth-profiling and in situ techniques to probe the nature of the surface reactions that occur when aluminum (Al)-substituted LLZO is exposed to air. These experiments show that a proton exchange reaction occurs near the surface of the LLZO and leads to change in its chemistry and structure, concomitant with the formation of Li2CO3. But these reactions can be readily reversed by heating samples at 250 °C under an inert atmosphere to recover LLZO surface chemistry and structure. Symmetrical cells containing samples treated this way exhibited much lower area specific impedances than those containing air-exposed LLZO without the treatment, confirming the reversal of the degradation process. Our results show a process to rejuvenate LLZO surface, and this opens the possibility of integrating this material in solid-state devices.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1016/j.matlet.2018.08.006
Structure and Lithium-Ion Dynamics in Fluoride-Doped Cubic Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO) Garnet for Li Solid-State Battery Applications,"© 2018 American Chemical Society. The lithium-stuffed garnet Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO), when suitably doped, is a promising candidate material for use as a solid-state electrolyte within advanced Li-ion batteries. It possesses the thermal and mechanical stability of many inorganic ceramics, while exhibiting high Li + ionic conductivities often associated with conventional liquid electrolytes, making it an ideal component for large-scale energy storage. However, only the high-temperature cubic phase has any meaningful Li-ion conductivity. Typically the formation of this phase is achieved through cation doping (e.g., Al 3+ on the Li site) to lower the Li content and so disrupt Li ordering. However, Li-site doping, in particular, may potentially lead to some disruption of the Li-ion conduction pathways and suboptimal ionic conductivities. Consequently, other novel doping strategies involving the anion site are gaining traction, for example, F - for O 2- as an alternative strategy to lower the Li content without directly blocking the lithium-diffusion pathways. For the first time, classical potential-based simulations have been employed to simulate the incorporation of fluoride anions into LLZO. Low incorporation energies have been calculated, suggesting fluoride anions are stable on the oxygen sites with a compensating lithium-ion vacancy defect. Molecular dynamics calculations suggest a definitive phase transition to the more desirable cubic phase of LLZO when doped with fluoride at temperature significantly lower than that for the tetragonal-cubic phase transition found for pure LLZO. Remarkably, the lithium-ion transport properties are shown to improve in the fluoride-doped samples particularly at low temperatures due to the stabilization of the cubic phase, suggesting anion doping of garnet systems may be a compelling alternative route to optimize the ionic conductivity.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acsami.8b17223
Mechanism Study on the Interfacial Stability of a Lithium Garnet-Type Oxide Electrolyte against Cathode Materials,"© Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.All-solid-state lithium-ion battery is considered to be one of the most promising next-generation battery technologies. Understanding the interfacial evolution of a solid electrolyte and a cathode electrode during mixing and sintering is of great importance and can provide guidance to avoid forming unwanted compounds and decrease the interfacial resistance. In this work, chemical compatibilities are investigated between a Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte and major commercial metal-oxide cathodes LiCoO2 (LCO) and Li(NiCoMn)1/3O2 (NCM) through ball-milling and cosintering processes. As revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, LLZO spontaneously covers the majority of the large LCO and NCM particles with a thickness of ∼100 nm after ball milling. The thickness of LLZO layer on these cathodes decreases to about 10 nm after cosintering at 873 K, and an interfacial layer of approximately 3 nm is observed for NCM/LLZO. LCO shows a higher thermal stability than NCM. Density functional theory (DFT)-based simulations and electrochemical measurements suggest Ni-La and Ni-Li exchange could happen at the NCM/LLZO interface and Li can diffuse from the interface into NCM to occupy the Ni vacancy at high temperature. The Li depletion layer after diffusion at the interface induces the decomposition of LLZO and the formation of La2Zr2O7 and LaNiO3 interfacial layer.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1002/adma.201804098
High lithium ionic conductivity of garnet-type oxide Li7+xLa3Zr2-xSmxO12 (x = 0–0.1) ceramics,"© 2018Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet is one of the most promising Lithium-ion solid electrolytes in all-solid-state Lithium-ion batteries, due to its higher chemical stability to Li metal and relatively higher lithium-ion conductivity. To further increase the electrical conductivity of LLZO, Sm3+ is doped into the Zr4+ site of LLZO so that excess Li occupies the position of the octahedral. Thereby lithium ion transport and increasing ionic conductivity are promoted. The optimal addition of Sm3+ is 0.06. Li7+xLa3Zr2-xSmxO12 (LLZSO, x = 0.06) electrolyte with cubic phase is obtained with sintering at 1200 °C for only 3 h. It has higher relative density and better ionic conductivity than the pristine LLZO.

Grain Boundary Softening: A Potential Mechanism for Lithium Metal Penetration through Stiff Solid Electrolytes,"© 2018 American Chemical Society. Models based on linear elasticity suggest that a solid electrolyte with a high shear modulus will suppress ""dendrite"" formation in batteries that use metallic lithium as the negative electrode. Nevertheless, recent experiments find that lithium can penetrate stiff solid electrolytes through microstructural features, such as grain boundaries. This failure mode emerges even in cases where the electrolyte has an average shear modulus that is an order of magnitude larger than that of Li. Adopting the solid-electrolyte Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO) as a prototype, here we demonstrate that significant softening in elastic properties occurs in nanoscale regions near grain boundaries. Molecular dynamics simulations performed on tilt and twist boundaries reveal that the grain boundary shear modulus is up to 50% smaller than in bulk regions. We propose that inhomogeneities in elastic properties arising from microstructural features provide a mechanism by which soft lithium can penetrate ostensibly stiff solid electrolytes.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.06.014
A Simple and Fast Electrochemical CO2 Sensor Based on Li7La3Zr2O12 for Environmental Monitoring,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimIn the goal of a sustainable energy future, either the energy efficiency of renewable energy sources is increased, day-to-day energy consumption by smart electronic feedback loops is managed in a more efficient way, or contribution to atmospheric CO2 is reduced. By defining a next generation of fast-response electrochemical CO2 sensors and materials, one can contribute to local monitoring of CO2 flows from industrial plants and processes, for energy management and building control or to track climate alterations. Electrochemical Li+-garnet-based sensors with Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolytes can reach notable 1 min response time at lowered operation temperatures to track 400–4000 ppm levels of CO2 when compared with state-of-the-art NASICON-based sensors.

Preparation of a Li7La3Zr1.5Nb0.5O12 Garnet Solid Electrolyte Ceramic by using Sol-gel Powder Synthesis and Hot Pressing and Its Characterization,"© 2018, The Korean Physical Society.In this study, we prepared and characterized Nb-doped Li7La3Zr2−xO12 (LLZNO) powder and pellets with a cubic garnet structure by using a modified sol-gel synthesis and hot pressing. LLZNO powder with a very small grain size and cubic structure without secondary phases could be obtained by using a synthesis method in which Li and La sources in a propanol solvent were mixed together with Zr and Nb sources in 2-methoxy ethanol. A pure cubic phase LLZNO pellet could be fabricated from the prepared LLZNO and an additional 6-wt% of Li2CO3 powder by hot pressing at 1050 °C and 15.8 MPa. The hot-pressed LLZNO pellet with a relative density of 99% exhibited a very dense surface morphology. The total Li ionic conductivity of the hot-pressed LLZNO was 7.4×10 −4 S/cm at room temperature, which is very high level compared to other reported values. The activation energy for ionic conduction was estimated to be 0.40 eV.",Journal of the Korean Physical Society,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.07.174
Structural (in)stability and spontaneous cracking of Li-La-zirconate cubic garnet upon exposure to ambient atmosphere,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdAmong the Li-ion conducting inorganic materials, lithium lanthanum zirconate (LLZO) is believed to possess good chemical stability against Li metal and hence considered to be a promising solid electrolyte for Li-ion batteries. However, systematic sets of studies conducted here at regular intervals during storage of Al-doped LLZO (cubic garnet) sintered pellets in ambient atmosphere have raised serious concerns over their structural/mechanical stability/integrity upon exposure to air. Spontaneous cracking/disintegration/pulverization of LLZO pellets takes place after about three weeks of exposure, primarily due to formation of La2Zr2O7 in the LLZO bulk; as found to be thermodynamically feasible at room temperature upon reaction with CO2/moisture. Steep increase in La2Zr2O7 content coincides with the spontaneous cracking/disintegration. Estimation suggests that internal stresses associated with the formation of La2Zr2O7 from LLZO can be high enough to cause spontaneous fracture. This mandates the development/fabrication/usage of solid-state cells using LLZO under stringent controls against exposure to atmospheric species.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.2.105404
Structural and Computational Assessment of the Influence of Wet-Chemical Post-Processing of the Al-Substituted Cubic Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and related compounds are considered as promising candidates for future all-solid-state Li-ion battery applications. Still, the processing of those materials into thin membranes with the right stoichiometry and crystal structure is difficult and laborious. The sensitivity of the Li-ion conductive garnets against moisture and the associated Li+/H+ cation exchange makes their processing even more difficult. Formulation of suitable polymer/ceramic hybrid solid state electrolytes could be a prosperous way to reach the future large scale production of solid state Li-ion batteries. In fact, solvent mediated and/or slurry based wet-processing of the LLZO, e.g., tape-casting, could result in irreversible Li-ion loss of the pristine material due to Li+/H+ cation exchange. The concomitant structural changes and loss in functionality in terms of Li-ion conductivity are the results of the above process. Therefore, in the present work a systematic study on the chemical stability and structural retention of Al-substituted LLZO in different solvents is reported. It was found that Li+/H+ exchange in LLZO occurs upon solvent immersion, and its magnitude is dependent on the availability of -OH functional groups of the solvent molecules. As a result, a larger degree of Li+/H+ exchange causes higher increase of the lattice parameter of the LLZO, determined by synchrotron diffraction analyses. The expansion of the cubic unit cell was ascertained, when Li+ was replaced by H+ in the host lattice, by ab initio computational studies. The application of the most common solvent as dispersion medium, i.e., high purity water, causes the most significant Li+/H+ exchange and, therefore, structural change, while acetonitrile was proven to be the best suitable solvent for wet postprocessing of LLZO. Finally, computational calculations suggested that the Li+/H+ exchange could result in diminished ionic, i.e., mixed Li+-H+, conductivity due to the insertion of protons with lower mobility than that of Li-ions.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsaem.8b01141
Li+ transport channel size governing Li+ migration in garnet-based all-solid-state lithium batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Li+ transport channel size of garnet-type Li7La3Z2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolytes is continuously regulated to study its governing of Li+ migration in application of all-solid-state batteries. Results show that the Li+ migration activation energy decrease with the decrease of Li+ transport channel size and then increase with further decrease of Li+ transport channel size. With Li+ transport channel size of 12.954 Å, the Li+ migration activation energy reaches minimum of 0.28 eV. The cyclic voltammogram of Au/Li7La3-XCaXZr2-YTaYO12/Li cells show that, with Li+ transport channel size of 12.954 Å, the redox peaks is at ±0.23 V, which is more symmetrical and closer to 0 V compared to both larger and smaller Li+ transport channel size of 12.961 Å (0.38 V and −0.32 V) and 12.935 Å (0.50 V and −0.40 V). This suggests that LLZO with Li+ transport channel size of 12.954 Å has better charge-discharge reversibility of lithium deposition and dissolution and less energy consumption when used as solid electrolyte in all-solid-state lithium batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1021/acsaem.8b00976
Molecular dynamics simulations with machine learning potential for Nb-doped lithium garnet-type oxide Li7-xLa3(Zr2-xNbx) O12,"© 2018 American Physical Society.Lithium garnet-type oxide Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is one of the most promising solid electrolyte materials. In this study, the Li conduction properties of Nb-doped LLZO, Li6.75La3(Zr1.75Nb0.25)O12, have been investigated by molecular dynamics simulations with the machine learning potential. It is shown that Nb-doped LLZO holds a high-conductivity cubic structure at low temperatures. Two kinds of Li occupation sites, 24d and 96h, are correctly predicted, which form the three-dimensional network of the Li migration pathway. The Li conductivity at 298 K and the activation energy are obtained as σLi=5.0×10-3S/cm and Ea=223meV, respectively, which are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental data. The free energy difference between the 24d and 96h sites is expected to be negligibly small. This most likely contributes a high Li conductivity in the Nb-doped LLZO. The Nb substitution for Zr is accompanied with the Li vacancy formation due to the charge neutrality condition, which stabilizes the cubic phase and enhance the Li conduction. The Nb substitution, however, also has a negative effect. The supervalency of the Nb5+ ion destabilizes the Li atoms at the surrounding 96h sites. The Li conductivity in Nb-doped LLZO is determined by trading off between these effects.",Physical Review Materials,10.1007/s10008-018-4010-3
Space-Charge Layers in All-Solid-State Batteries; Important or Negligible?,"Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.All-solid state batteries have the promise to increase the safety of Li-ion batteries. A prerequisite for high-performance all-solid-state batteries is a high Li-ion conductivity through the solid electrolyte. In recent decades, several solid electrolytes have been developed which have an ionic conductivity comparable to that of common liquid electrolytes. However, fast charging and discharging of all-solid-state batteries remains challenging. This is generally attributed to poor kinetics over the electrode-solid electrolyte interface because of poorly conducting decomposition products, small contact areas, or space-charge layers. To understand and quantify the role of space-charge layers in all-solid-state batteries a simple model is presented which allows to asses the interface capacitance and resistance caused by the space-charge layer. The model is applied to LCO (LiCoO2) and graphite electrodes in contact with an LLZO (Li7La3Zr2O12) and LATP (Li1.2Al0.2Ti1.8(PO4)3) solid electrolyte at several voltages. The predictions demonstrate that the space-charge layer for typical electrode-electrolyte combinations is about a nanometer in thickness, and the consequential resistance for Li-ion transport through the space-charge layer is negligible, except when layers completely depleted of Li-ions are formed in the solid electrolyte. This suggests that space-charge layers have a negligible impact on the performance of all-solid-state batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1007/s11164-018-3474-1
None-Mother-Powder Method to Prepare Dense Li-Garnet Solid Electrolytes with High Critical Current Density,"Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.Cubic Li-garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO) is a promising Li+ ion conductor for applications as a ceramic solid electrolyte in next generation high safety lithium batteries. The sintering temperature of c-LLZO is usually higher than 1100 °C, where Li-loss is severe, especially in conventional air ambient sintering method. Covering the green body with ""mother powder"" is often adopted for compensating the Li-loss. The mother powder having the same composition as the green body cannot be repeatedly use, which raises the cost of the c-LLZO ceramics. A self-compensating Li-loss method without mother powder is proposed and investigated to prepare high-quality c-LLZO ceramics. In this method, excess lithium is added to c-LLZO green pellets to self-compensate Li-loss at high temperature. The impact of different amounts of excess Li and crucible material, such as Pt, MgO, Al2O3, and ZrO2 is studied. With optimized such sintering method, Ta doped LLZO pellets with 10% excess Li can be well sintered inside low-cost MgO crucible without mother powder at 1250 °C for only 40 min and laboratory scale production is demonstrated. The ceramics have relative densities of ∼96%, conductivities of ∼6.47 × 10-4 S cm-1 and critical current density of 1.15 mA cm-2 at 25 °C, which is fundamental for further researches on solid-state batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b06275

Effect of solvated ionic liquids on the ion conducting property of composite membranes for lithium ion batteries,"© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.We prepared the polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based composite membrane electrolytes which contained the specialized ionic liquids and the inorganic filler of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). Mixtures of ionic liquids and tetragonal inorganic fillers were used as additives to prepare composite electrolytes for an application of all solid-state lithium ion batteries (ASLBs). In order to improve the ionic conductivity of composite membranes, we studied the structural change and the electrochemical behaviors as a function of the amounts of solvated ionic liquids (ILs). The addition effect of solvated ILs showed the higher ionic conductivity such as 10−4 S/cm at 55 °C by reducing the crystalline character of polymer based composite, resulting in the enhanced ion conducting property. The hybrid composite membranes were successfully made in flexible form, and have an excellent thermal and electrochemical stability. Finally, the electrochemical performance of the half-cell was evaluated, and it was confirmed that the ion-conducting characteristics were influenced and controlled by the effect of ILs.",Research on Chemical Intermediates,10.1016/j.jtice.2018.02.021
Molecular Dynamics Studies on the Lithium Ion Conduction Behaviors Depending on Tilted Grain Boundaries with Various Symmetries in Garnet-Type Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Grain boundary (GB) structure is a critical parameter that significantly affects the macroscopic properties of materials; however, the evaluation of GB characteristics by modern analytical methods remains an extremely challenging task.

It was found that the transboundary diffusion of Li ions was generally slower than their diffusion in the bulk regardless of the GB symmetry; however, this effect strongly depended on the concentration of Li-deficient sites (trapping Li vacancies) in the GB layer. Furthermore, the compactness and density of the combined GB regions represent the key parameters affecting the overall Li+ conductivity of polycrystalline LLZO films.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1016/j.ensm.2018.02.015
"Structure, Chemistry, and Charge Transfer Resistance of the Interface between Li7La3Zr2O12 Electrolyte and LiCoO2 Cathode","Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.All-solid-state batteries promise significant safety and energy density advantages over liquid-electrolyte batteries. The interface between the cathode and the solid electrolyte is an important contributor to charge transfer resistance. Strong bonding of solid oxide electrolytes and cathodes requires sintering at elevated temperatures. Knowledge of the temperature dependence of the composition and charge transfer properties of this interface is important for determining the ideal sintering conditions. To understand the interfacial decomposition processes and their onset temperatures, model systems of LiCoO2 (LCO) thin films deposited on cubic Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) pellets were studied as a function of temperature using interface-sensitive techniques. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy data indicated significant cation interdiffusion and structural changes starting at temperatures as low as 300 °C. La2Zr2O7 and Li2CO3 were identified as decomposition products after annealing at 500 °C by synchrotron X-ray diffraction. X-ray absorption spectroscopy results indicate the presence of also LaCoO3 in addition to La2Zr2O7 and Li2CO3. On the basis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and depth profiling of the Li distribution upon potentiostatic hold experiments on symmetric LCO|LLZO|LCO cells, the interfaces exhibited significantly increased impedance, up to 8 times that of the as-deposited samples after annealing at 500 °C. Our results indicate that lower-temperature processing conditions, shorter annealing time scales, and CO2-free environments are desirable for obtaining ceramic cathode|electrolyte interfaces that enable fast Li transfer and high capacity.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1016/j.jechem.2017.10.006
Low-temperature processing of Garnet-type ion conductive cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 powders for high performance all solid-type Li-ion batteries,"© 2018 Taiwan Institute of Chemical EngineersSynthesis of lithium stuffed cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO) garnet at low-processing temperatures is hampered by the lack of deep understanding on powder processing technology. The present article proposes a hybrid solid-state approach to accomplish controllable synthesis of Al doped LLZO cubic garnet oxide nanoparticles at low-processing temperatures. In this procedure, powders of ZrO2 and La(OH)3 in ethanol based suspension were mechanochemically (MC) treated along with 1 wt.% of AlOOH in a planetary ball mill with increasing milling time to increase the homogeneity of the precursor. Lithium acetate in the form of an ethanolic solution was subsequently added for the solid-state synthesis of single phase LLZO. Cubic LLZO phases were obtained at temperatures i.e. 700 °C within 3 h. The ease of lithium diffusion in these MC activated La-Zr precursor materials is attributed to the formation of single phase LLZO with the lowest Al3+ doping content. The sintered pellets (94% relative density at 1100 °C for 3 h in air) of the newly obtained Li6.61La3Zr2Al0.13O11.98 deliver high bulk Li-ion conductivity of 1.35 × 10− 4 Scm-1. The new low-temperature processing of typical garnet and the use of c-Li6.61La3Zr2Al0.13O11.98 nanoparticles could open pathways toward future solid electrolyte–electrode assembly options for all-solid state Li-ion batteries.",Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.055
Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12@amorphous Li3OCl composite electrolyte for solid state lithium-metal batteries,"© 2018Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet-type oxide has become a promising inorganic electrolyte for solid-state lithium-ion batteries due to its high ionic conductivity and good chemical stability with the lithium metal. However, the poor wettability of LLZO garnet-type oxide with lithium metal and its incompact structure have impeded their extensive applications in solid-state lithium-ion batteries. Herein, Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LLZTO) particles were embedded in the amorphous Li3OCl to form an integrated composite electrolyte (LLZTO-2wt.% Li3OCl) with compact and stable structure at 350 °C, which presents high ionic conductivity (2.27 × 10−4 S cm−1), low interfacial resistance and high electrochemical stability (up to 10 V vs. Li/Li+) at room temperature. The amorphous Li3OCl acting as a binder, filler and bridge promotes the formation of an integrated composite electrolyte and continuous ionic conductive network among LLZTO particles. Furthermore, the Li3OCl with excellent affinity to lithium metal in-situ reacts with the lithium metal to form a stable and dense interfacial layer, which greatly decreases the interfacial resistance between the composite electrolyte and lithium metal (from 1850 to 90 Ω cm2). The interfacial layer allied compact composite electrolyte also effectively suppresses the lithium dendrite growth during lithium plating-striping. The symmetrical Li/LLZTO-2wt.% Li3OCl/Li cell can stably cycle 1000 h without short circuit. The stable specific capacity of solid-state LiFePO4/LLZTO-2wt.% Li3OCl/Li battery is as high as 157.5 mAh g−1 and 85.7 mAh g−1 at 0.05 C and 0.5 C, respectively. Combining the garnet-type electrolyte with amorphous Li3OCl is a promising way to develop the compact garnet-type electrolyte at low temperature for solid-state lithium-ion batteries.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.02.032
Al-incorporation into Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte keeping stabilized cubic phase for all-solid-state Li batteries,"© 2017 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesWe observe the influence of Al occupancies in Li sites on the formation process of the garnet solid electrolyte of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). A direct incorporation of Al is first promoted in a Li-insufficient garnet solid electrolyte during the calcination process of 850 °C and then the cubic phase of LLZO is obtained after successive annealing step of 1000 °C. Comparing to pristine LLZO, Al incorporated LLZO shows less formation of Li2CO3, keeping crystallographic and physicochemical properties. This Al incorporation improves both the ionic conductivity and interfacial resistance to poisoning procedure.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.04.098
Demonstration of high current densities and extended cycling in the garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Replacing state-of-the-art graphite with metallic Li anodes could dramatically increase the energy density of Li-ion technology. However, efforts to achieve uniform Li plating and stripping in conventional liquid electrolytes have had limited success. An alternative approach is to use a solid electrolyte to stabilize the Li interface during cycling. One of the most promising solid electrolytes is Li7La3Zr2O12, which has high ionic conductivity at room temperature, high shear modulus and chemical and electrochemical stability against Li. Despite these properties, Li filament propagation has been observed through LLZO at current densities below what is practical. By combining recent achievements in reducing interface resistance and optimizing microstructure, we demonstrate Li cycling at current densities competitive with Li-ion. Li|LLZO|Li cells are capable of cycling at up to 0.9 ± 0.7 mA cm−2, 3.8 ± 0.9 mA cm−2, and 6.0 ± 0.7 mA cm-2 at room temperature, 40 and 60 °C, respectively. Extended stability is shown in Li plating/stripping tests that passed 3 mAh cm−2 charge per cycle for a cumulative capacity of 702 mAh cm−2 using a 1 mA cm−2 current density. These results demonstrate that solid-state batteries using metallic Li anodes can approach charge/discharge rates and cycling stability comparable to SOA Li-ion.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.05.006
Mechanical properties of the solid electrolyte Al-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) by utilizing micro-pillar indentation splitting test,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdGarnet structured Al-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 (Al:LLZO) is a promising candidate as electrolyte in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries due to its chemical stability against Li-metal and high voltage cathode materials. In order to ensure long-term stable operation, electrolyte crack growth induced and/or the volume change of the active material on the cathode side needs to be avoided, requiring in particular knowledge of local and global mechanical properties of the electrolyte material. Micro-pillar splitting test was used for the first time on this material to determine the microscopic fracture toughness of single grains and compare it with conventional Vickers indentation fracture toughness (VIF), which represents macroscopic fracture toughness. Both methods yielded comparative results. In conclusion, the micro-pillar splitting test can be used as an advanced locally resolved characterization method that can open up new experimental directions for characterizing and understanding battery materials and enable a targeted approach for material improvements.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,10.1039/c8ee00540k
Computational study of lithium nucleation tendency in Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and rational design of interlayer materials to prevent lithium dendrites,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.The driving force for the metallic lithium formation in solid electrolytes, such as the cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO), is still puzzling, considering the large band gap of c-LLZO and the preference of Li being ionic in oxides. In this paper, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the ability of the pore surfaces to trap excess electrons, which is essential to Li nucleation tendency. Two interlayer materials were also studied, tetragonal LLZO (t-LLZO) and Li2PO2N (atomic layer deposited LiPON). It was found that excess electrons would be trapped, either around the La atoms on the surface of c-LLZO or dispersed on the surface of t-LLZO. It is also thermodynamically favorable for the excess electrons on La3+ to reduce Li+. In contrast, the excess electrons were located underneath the surface in Li2PO2N, making it hard to reduce Li+. Thus the surfaces in c-LLZO provide a possible electron pathway for metallic Li formation, and the t-LLZO interlayer observed at the Li/c-LLZO interface would not stop Li dendrites due to its similar Li nucleation tendency as c-LLZO. Furthermore, we propose that an interlayer of Li2PO2N at the Li/c-LLZO interface would be efficient and defect tolerant to suppress Li dendrite formation.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.elspec.2018.05.007
Flexible poly(ethylene carbonate)/garnet composite solid electrolyte reinforced by poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) for lithium metal batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Solid-state electrolytes with high ionic conductivities, great flexibility, and easy processability are needed for high-performance solid-state rechargeable lithium batteries. In this work, we synthesize nanosized cubic Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) by solution combustion method and develop a flexible garnet-based composite solid electrolyte composed of LLZO, poly(ethylene carbonate) (PEC), poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VdF-HFP) and lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI)). In the flexible composite solid electrolytes, LLZO nanoparticles, as ceramic matrix, have a positive effect on ionic conductivities and lithium ion transference number (tLi+). PEC, as a fast ion-conducting polymer, possesses high tLi+ inherently. P(VdF-HFP), as a binder, can strengthen mechanical properties. Consequently, the as-prepared composite solid electrolyte demonstrates high tLi+ (0.82) and superb thermal stability (remaining LLZO matrix after burning). All-solid-state LiFePO4|Li cells assembled with the flexible composite solid electrolyte deliver a high initial discharge specific capacity of 121.4 mAh g−1 and good cycling stability at 55 °C.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.04.076
The role of the solid electrolyte interphase layer in preventing Li dendrite growth in solid-state batteries,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium (Li) metal anodes have regained intensive interest in recent years due to the ever-increasing demand for next-generation high energy battery technologies. Li metal, unfortunately, suffers from poor cycling stability and low efficiency as well as from the formation of dangerous Li dendrites, raising safety concerns. Utilizing solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) to prevent Li dendrite growth provides a promising approach to tackle the challenge. However, recent studies indicate that Li dendrites easily form at high current densities, which calls for full investigation of the fundamental mechanisms of Li dendrite formation within SSEs. Herein, the origin and evolution of Li dendrite growth through SSEs have been studied and compared by using Li6.1Ga0.3La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and NASICON-type Li2O-Al2O3-P2O5-TiO2-GeO2 (LATP) pellets as the separators. We discover that a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)-like interfacial layer between Li and SSE plays a critical role in alleviating the growth of dendritic Li, providing new insights into the interface between SSE and Li metal to enable future all solid-state batteries.",Energy and Environmental Science,10.1007/s11581-018-2464-z
Influence of Gallium Substitution on the Crystal and Electronic Properties of Li5Ca1-xGaxLa3Zr2O12 Solid State Battery Electrolyte,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.In this study, calcium doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) were synthesized as a candidate for the solid state electrolyte material according to the Li7-2x CaxLa3Zr2O12 (LCLZO) general formula where x has the value “1.0” and also the parent material for the sample series of Li5Ca1- xGaxLa3Zr2O12. Crystal and electronic properties of the LCLZO materials were studied in two steps; Ca2+ substitution to Li+ coordinations and Ga3+ substitution to Ca2+ coordinations. Analysis confirmed that a calcium sit in two lithium coordinations, however, the Ca2+ doped LCLZO material were determined in tetragonal structure, not cubic, which has lower properties for battery electrolytes. In the second step of the study, with the attempt of the substitution of the Ga3+ ions to the Ca2+ coordinations, the phase of the tetragonal LCLZO structures changed to cubic LCLZO structure. According to the XAS analysis of the O K-edge spectra, it is determined that oxygen coodinations are the main role player in the samples and cause the formation of the “Li5GaO4” structures with the Ga3+ substitution.",Journal of Electron Spectroscopy and Related Phenomena,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.277
Boosting interfacial Li+ transport with a MOF-based ionic conductor for solid-state batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdConcerning the large interfacial resistance of materials within solid-stated batteries (SSBs) caused by the unstable solid contact, an assistant ionic conductor is introduced to improve the interfacial Li+ transport of SSBs. The assistant ionic conductor is achieved by impregnating an ionic liquid (Li-IL) into a porous metal-organic framework (MOF) host. When integrated with LLZO solid-state electrolyte (SSE), the solidified Li-IL guest can make direct contact with the LLZO particles through the open channels in MOF host, which changes the original unstable solid-solid contact into “nanowetted” interfaces to boost Li+ transport. Benefited from the unique nanowetted interfaces, the hybrid SSE demonstrates a high ionic conductivity of 1.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 with a wide electrochemical window of 5.2 V, and also exhibits excellent compatibility with Li metal anode. Furthermore, the LLZO based LiCoO4 and LiFePO4 SSBs with the ionic conductor additive to favor the interfacial Li+ transport achieve high capacity retention of 97% after 150 cycles with reasonable rate capability. The good electrochemical performance is attributed to the effective Li+ transport networks established inside the SSBs by the ionic conductor through the nanowetted interfacial mechanism, which is proved to be a promising approach to the safe and high-power energy storage.",Nano Energy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.04.016
Dramatic reduction in the densification temperature of garnet-type solid electrolytes,"© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Cubic garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and similar compositions of fast ion-conducting solid-state electrolytes have shown great potential for the development of high-energy-density solid-state Li-ion batteries. Although these materials have shown unprecedented ionic conductivities and chemical stability, these materials require high processing temperatures for synthesis. For many of the common compositions of LLZO, temperatures above 1000 °C are required to form the cubic garnet phase and to achieve high conductivities. Therefore, lowering the processing temperatures of these materials is of great interest for the purposes of scalability and fabrication. It has been reported that a Bi co-dopant not only stabilizes the cubic garnet phase but also lowers the densification temperature. In this study, Li6La3ZrBiO12 (LLZBO) was prepared by a rapid-induction hot-pressing technique and characterized using a variety of techniques, including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. We demonstrate the ability to synthesize phase-pure LLZBO with higher relative densities (~ 94%) than can be achieved by pressure-less sintering methods, at pressing temperatures of only 850 °C. The ionic conductivity was measured to be 0.1 mS cm−1, which is comparable to the best reported conductivities of high-density LLZO. This demonstrates the ability to fabricate dense, phase-pure, and high-conductivity LLZBO at temperatures significantly lower than other garnet compositions, which will prove useful for scalability and reducing reactivity with cathodes during densification.",Ionics,10.1002/aenm.201703474
Structural insights on understanding the cubic phase stabilization mechanism of sol-gel synthesized Li7-3xAlxLa3Zr2O12 (x = 0–0.4) – The effect of ZrOCl2 and ZrO(NO3)2,"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Stabilization of cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 phase, one of the most promising solid electrolytes for Li-ion batteries, has been extensively studied in terms of various stabilizer additions in solution-based systems. However, different dissociation behavior of precursors on the cubic LLZO phase stabilization has not been studied. In this study, we offer an understanding for the stabilization of cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 phase by using ZrOCl2 and ZrO(NO3)2, which are having different dissociation behavior, with 0–40 mol% Al addition. After calcination at 1000 °C for 6 h, cubic phase is stabilized starting from 20 mol% Al content when ZrOCl2 was used, whereas tetragonal Li7La3Zr2O12 obtained for all Al contents when ZrO(NO3)2 was used. The highest ionic conductivity is obtained in the 30 mol% Al containing sample produced with the use of ZrOCl2. In the case of ZrOCl2 precursor, due to the higher tendency of Zr–O bond formation after dissociation, the cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 phase is stabilized. On the other hand, the presence of nitrate ions within solution hinders the cubic phase formation of Li7La3Zr2O12.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.04.019

Garnet Electrolytes for Solid State Batteries: Visualization of Moisture-Induced Chemical Degradation and Revealing Its Impact on the Li-Ion Dynamics,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.In this work, we reveal the impact of moisture-induced chemical degradation and proton-lithium exchange on the Li-ion dynamics in the bulk and the grain boundaries and at the interface with lithium metal in highly Li-conducting garnet electrolytes. A direct correlation between chemical changes as measured by depth-resolved secondary ion mass spectrometry and the change in transport properties of the electrolyte is provided. In order to probe the intrinsic effect of the exchange on the lithium kinetics within the garnet structure, isolated from secondary corrosion product contributions, controlled-atmosphere processing was first used to produce proton-free Li6.55Ga0.15La3Zr2O12 (Ga0.15-LLZO), followed by degradation steps in a H2O bath at 100 °C, leading to the removal of LiOH secondary phases at the surface. The proton-exchanged region was analyzed by focused ion beam secondary ion mass spectrometry (FIB-SIMS) and found to extend as far as 1.35 μm into the Ga0.15-LLZO garnet pellet after 30 min in H2O. Impedance analysis in symmetrical cells with Li metal electrodes indicated a greater reactivity in grain boundaries than in grains and a significantly detrimental effect on the Li transfer kinetics in the Li metal/garnet interface correlated to a 3-fold decrease in the Li mobility in the protonated garnet. This result indicates that the deterioration of Li charge transfer and diffusion kinetics in proton-containing garnet electrolytes have fundamental implications for the optimization and integration of these systems in commercial battery devices.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.02.134

Synthesis of Ta and Ca doped Li7La3Zr2O12 solid-state electrolyte via simple solution method and its application in suppressing shuttle effect of Li-S battery,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.A modified solution method was applied to synthesize cubic garnet solid-state electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and Li6.45Ca0.05La2.95Ta0.6Zr1.4O12 (LCLTZO). The synergetic doping of Ca and Ta is found to induce the formation of cubic LCLZTO with high ionic conductivity of 4.03 × 10−4 S cm−1 while LLZO without substitution exhibits tetragonal phase with low conductivity. A Li-S cell with sulfur cathode and as-prepared LCLTZO solid electrolyte “separator” was conducted to deliver large initial discharge capacity of 1090 mAh g−1 with high initial Coulombic efficiency up to 92%. Cell with LCLTZO also exhibited better cycling performance at 0.2 C and extremely high Coulombic efficiency (close to 100%) than the cell without solid electrolyte. Better rate performance was also achieved at lower rate (0.2 C, 0.5 C and 1 C) by cell with LCLTZO although it lost advantages at higher rate of 2 C and 5 C due to the limitation of ionic conductivity of LCLTZO. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) provided direct evidence that LCLTZO solid electrolyte greatly suppressed the shuttle effect generated by polysulfides. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was applied to discuss the difference between cells with and without LCLTZO during the discharge process. Charge transfer reaction referred to soluble polysulfides was found to be slower in cell with LCLTZO than that in cell without solid electrolyte.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1021/acsami.8b03163

Mechanical behavior of Li-ion-conducting crystalline oxide-based solid electrolytes: a brief review,"© 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Li-ion-conducting solid electrolytes are receiving considerable attention for use in advanced batteries. These electrolytes would enable use of a Li metal anode, allowing for batteries with higher energy densities and enhanced safety compared to current Li-ion systems. One important aspect of these electrolytes that has been overlooked is their mechanical properties. Mechanical properties will play a large role in the processing, assembly, and operation of battery cells. Hence, this paper reviews the elastic, plastic, and fracture properties of crystalline oxide-based Li-ion solid electrolytes for three different crystal structures: Li6.19Al0.27La3Zr2O12 (garnet) [LLZO], Li0.33La0.57TiO3 (perovskite) [LLTO], and Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (NaSICON) [LATP]. The experimental Young’s modulus value for (1) LLTO is ~ 200 GPa, (2) LLZO is ~ 150 GPa, and (3) for LATP ~ 115 GPa. The experimental values are in good agreement with density functional theory predictions. The fracture toughness value for all three of LLTO, LLZO, and LATP is approximately 1 MPa m−2. This low value is expected since, they all exhibit at least some degree of covalent bonding, which limits dislocation mobility leading to brittle behavior.",Ionics,10.1016/j.matlet.2018.01.073

Gd-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 garnet-type solid electrolytes for all-solid-state Li-Ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdLi7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet is one of the most promising Li-ion solid electrolytes for all-solid-state Li-ion batteries, owing to its high chemical stability against Li metal and relatively high Li-ion conductivity. In order to further enhance the conductivity of LLZO, Gd3+ is used to dope LLZO at the Zr4+ site, in order to enable excess Li to occupy the octahedral sites, which could facilitate Li-ion transport and increase ionic conductivity. In this study, Li7+xLa3Zr2-xGdxO12 (LLZGO, x = 0–0.5) solid electrolytes with cubic phase and high relative densities are prepared at 1220 °C using a solid-state reaction method. It is found that LLZGO garnets with x from 0.1 to 0.2 deliver higher conductivities than pristine LLZO. Among these, the Li7.2La3Zr1.8Gd0.2O12 (LLZG2O) sample achieves the highest room-temperature total conductivity of 2.3 × 10−4 S cm−1. X-ray diffraction characterization confirms that LLZG2O is chemically stable against Li metal at room temperature for half a month. Cyclic voltammetry shows that LLZG2O possesses good electrochemical stability and reversibility of Li dissolution and deposition reactions. Symmetrical cells using a LLZG2O solid electrolyte and two Li metal electrodes are cycled galvanostatically under various current densities. The results demonstrate that the cell can achieve excellent cycling stability and low overpotentials for the dissolution and deposition reactions of Li. The substitution of Gd3+ for Zr4+ is effective in improving the Li-ion conductivity of LLZO, and Li7+xLa3Zr2-xGdxO12 could be promising as solid electrolytes for high-performance all-solid-state Li-ion batteries.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1021/acsenergylett.8b00249
Fabrication of Li7La3Zr2O12 fibers using bio-mass template Kapok,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Garnet-type lithium ion conductor Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has received great attention toward development of all solid-state lithium ion batteries due to its high lithium ion conductivity and relative stability against lithium metal at room temperature. Nowadays, more efforts about LLZO focus on studying the effect of crystal structure and ion doping on lithium ion conductivity. However, the morphology of LLZO also is somehow less studied. In this paper, LLZO fibers are successfully synthesized using naturally bio-mass Kapok fibers as template. The pellets pressed by LLZO fibers exhibit higher lithium ion-conductivity with the value 1.30 × 10−4 S·cm−1. Meanwhile LLZO ink obtained by dispersing LLZO fibers into isopropanol reveals Newtonian fluid property, and is potentially suitable for jet printing.",Materials Letters,10.1142/S1793604718500297
Structure and ionic conductivity of Li7La3Zr2−xGexO12 garnet-like solid electrolyte for all solid state lithium ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Lithium garnet-like structure with the substitution of Zr4+ sites by the same value of Ge4+ in the Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has been synthesized by a solid state reaction. The results indicate that doping Ge4+ in the LLZO was able to reduce the sintering temperature as well as increase the density of the pellets. The prepared samples Li7La3Zr2−xGexO12 with cubic garnet like structure were characterized by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra. The lithium ionic conductivity of all components was characterized by AC impendence at 20 °C, and the high ionic conductivity can be obtained with 4.78 × 10−4 S/cm, while a low activation energy was only about 0.29 eV in the temperature range from 253 to 213 K. The solid electrolyte of Li7La3Zr2−xGexO12 possessed a wide electrochemical window. A full cell containing the Li7La3Zr1.7Ge0.3O12 electrolyte was assembled to test the electrical performance, which demonstrates that the first discharge capacity can reach up to 139.1 mA g−1 at 0.1 C and the discharge capacity remains at 140.6 mA g−1 after 20 cycles. These excellent performances indicate that Ge doping LLZO could be a promising electrolyte candidate for all solid state Li ion batteries.",Ceramics International,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.12.002
Effect of Pore Connectivity on Li Dendrite Propagation within LLZO Electrolytes Observed with Synchrotron X-ray Tomography,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a garnet-type material that demonstrates promising characteristics for all-solid-state battery applications due to its high Li-ion conductivity and its compatibility with Li metal. The primary limitation of LLZO is the propensity for short-circuiting at low current densities. Microstructure features such as grain boundaries, pore character, and density all contribute to this shorting phenomenon. Toward the goal of understanding processing-structure relationships for practical design of solid electrolytes, the present study tracks structural transformations in solid electrolytes processed at three different temperatures (1050, 1100, and 1150 °C) using synchrotron X-ray tomography. A subvolume of 300 μm3 captures the heterogeneity of the solid electrolyte microstructure while minimizing the computational intensity associated with 3D reconstructions. While the porosity decreases with increasing temperature, the underlying connectivity of the pore region increases. Solid electrolytes with interconnected pores short circuit at lower critical current densities than samples with less connected pores.",ACS Energy Letters,10.1016/j.joule.2018.02.007
Extremely dense microstructure and enhanced ionic conductivity in hot-isostatic pressing treated cubic garnet-type solid electrolyte of Ga2O3-doped Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.A large number of pores and a low relative density that are frequently observed in solid electrolytes reduce severely their ionic conductivity and thus limit their applicability. Here, we report on the use of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) for ameliorating the garnet-type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte of Ga2O3-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Ga-LLZO) with nominal composition of Li6.55Ga0.15La3Zr2O12. The Ga-LLZO pellets were conventionally sintered at 1075°C for 12h, and then were followed by HIP treatment at 120MPa and 1160°C under an Ar atmosphere. It is found that the HIP-treated Ga-LLZO shows an extremely dense microstructure and a significantly enhanced ionic conductivity. Coherent with the increase in relative density from 90.5% (untreated) to 97.5% (HIP-treated), the ionic conductivity of the HIP-treated Ga-LLZO reaches as high as 1.13×10-3S/cm at room temperature (25°C), being two times higher than that of 4.58×10-4S/cm for the untreated one.",Functional Materials Letters,10.1016/j.joule.2018.03.004

Samples of Li7La3Zr2-2xNbxYxO12 were fabricated using a solid-state reaction method. The results show that the introduction of Nb and Y can stabilise cubic-phase LLZO. The total conductivity of Li7La3ZrNb0.5Y0.5O12 electrolyte can reach 8.29 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C when sintered at 1230 °C for only 15 h.

Interphase Engineering Enabled All-Ceramic Lithium Battery,"© 2018 Elsevier Inc.Solid-state batteries (SSBs) can essentially improve battery safety. Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is considered one of the most promising solid electrolytes for SSBs. However, the performance of LLZO-based SSBs is limited by the large cathode/electrolyte interfacial resistance. High-rate and long-cycling SSBs were achieved only after adding flammable polymer or liquid electrolyte in the cathode at the sacrifice of safety. Here, we show that an all-ceramic cathode/electrolyte with an extremely low interfacial resistance can be realized by thermally soldering LiCoO2 (LCO) and LLZO together with the Li2.3−xC0.7+xB0.3−xO3 solid electrolyte interphase through the reaction between the Li2.3C0.7B0.3O3 solder and the Li2CO3 layers that can be conformally coated on both LLZO and LCO. The all-solid-state Li/LLZO/LCO battery with such an all-ceramic cathode/electrolyte exhibits high cycling stability and high rate performance, constituting a significant step toward the practical applications of SSBs. All-solid-state lithium batteries can essentially improve battery safety. However, the performance of all-solid-state batteries is limited by the large interfacial resistance between electrode and electrolyte. As a compromise, flammable liquid or polymer electrolyte was usually added at the electrode/electrolyte interface at a sacrifice of safety. Here we report a unique strategy of lowering the interfacial resistance between LiCoO2 cathode and Li7La3Zr2O12 electrolyte, so that all-ceramic cathode composite of intrinsically high safety can be achieved. Such an all-ceramic cathode-electrolyte enabled all-solid-state Li/LLZO/LiCoO2 batteries with high cycling stability. In addition, this approach is not limited to LiCoO2 cathode but can also be applied to other layered transition-metal oxide cathodes, promoting the practical application of all-solid-state lithium batteries. All-ceramic cathode-electrolyte with a low interfacial resistance can be realized by thermally soldering LiCoO2 and Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) together with Li2.3−xC0.7+xB0.3−xO3 solid electrolyte interphase through the reaction between the Li2.3C0.7B0.3O3 solder and the Li2CO3 layers that can be spontaneously coated on both LLZO and LiCoO2.

Growth of self-textured Ga3+-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 ceramics by solid state reaction and their significant enhancement in ionic conductivity,"© 2018 Author(s).A highly self-textured Ga2O3-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO-Ga) solid electrolyte with a nominal composition of Li6.55Ga0.15La3Zr2O12 is obtained by a simple and low-cost solid-state reaction technique, requiring no seed crystals to achieve grain orientation. The as-prepared self-textured LLZO-Ga shows a strong (420) preferred orientation with a high Lotgering factor of 0.91. Coherently, a terrace-shaped microstructure consisting of many parallel layers, indicating a two-dimensional-like growth mode, is clearly observed in the self-textured sample. As a result, the highly self-textured garnet-type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte of LLZO-Ga exhibits an extremely high ionic conductivity, reaching a state-of-the-art level of 2.06 × 10-3 S cm-1 at room temperature (25 °C) and thus shedding light on an important strategy for improving the structure and ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes.",Applied Physics Letters,10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b12387

Synthesis of Fine Cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 Powders in Molten LiCl-KCl Eutectic and Facile Densification by Reversal of Li+/H+ Exchange,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Recently, solid-state electrolytes have been a highly active area of research for future Li-ion batteries due to the potential for drastically improved energy density and safety. Among these materials, garnet structured lithium lanthanum zirconate (Li7La3Zr2O12, LLZO) shows particular promise owing to the high ionic conductivity of its cubic polymorph, inertness, and electrochemical stability against metallic lithium. Herein we report the facile preparation of phase-pure, cubic LLZO via molten salt synthesis in a eutectic mixture of LiCl-KCl at 900 °C. Fine powders of Al- and Ga-doped LLZO were obtained with primary particle sizes ranging from 0.3 to 3 μm. Depending on the consolidation conditions, pellets with up to 86% relative density could be obtained, with Li+ conductivity values ranging from 0.230 to 0.371 mS cm-1. It is also observed that while the effect of hydration has a profoundly deleterious effect on sintering and densification, this effect can be mitigated by the simple addition of LiOH before sintering to reverse hydration and aid densification. Qualitative discussions on the mechanisms of LLZO formation in the molten salt medium are discussed, in addition to implications for scalable processing of LLZO electrolytes.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,10.1016/j.matdes.2017.10.067
Interface instability of fe-stabilized Li7La3Zr2O12 versus li metal,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.The interface stability versus Li represents a major challenge in the development of next-generation all-solid-state batteries (ASSB), which take advantage of the inherently safe ceramic electrolytes. Cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 garnets represent the most promising electrolytes for this technology. The high interfacial impedance versus Li is, however, still a bottleneck toward future devices. Herein, we studied the electrochemical performance of Fe3+-stabilized Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO:Fe) versus Li metal and found a very high total conductivity of 1.1 mS cm-1 at room temperature but a very high area specific resistance of 1 k cm2. After removing the Li metal electrode we observe a black surface coloration at the interface, which clearly indicates interfacial degradation. Raman- and nanosecond laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy reveals, thereafter, the formation of a 130 μm thick tetragonal LLZO interlayer and a significant Li deficiency of about 1-2 formula units toward the interface. This shows that cubic LLZO:Fe is not stable versus Li metal by forming a thick tetragonal LLZO interlayer causing high interfacial impedance.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b10911
Correlating the interface resistance and surface adhesion of the Li metal-solid electrolyte interface,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.Solid electrolytes could enable stable cycling of metallic Li anodes, which can offer drastic increases to the capacity of Li-ion batteries. However, little is known about the mechanics of the Li-solid electrolyte interface. This study combines electrochemical and mechanical characterization to correlate interface kinetics with adhesive strength. Cubic garnet with the Li6·25Al0·25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) formulation was selected as a model solid electrolyte based on its high conductivity and stability against Li metal. Symmetric Li-LLZO cells were tested using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to determine the interfacial resistance, Rint, and the adhesive strength of the Li-LLZO interface, σadh, was measured using a unique tensile test in an inert atmosphere. It was determined that the Rint is directly correlated to the adhesive strength of Li on LLZO. At the highest Rint in this study, 330 k·cm2 the σadh was 1.1 kPa and at the lowest Rint in this study, 7 ·cm2, σadh was 8 MPa. Furthermore, by optimizing the surface chemistry the wettability of LLZO was enhanced resulting in σadh exceeding the ultimate tensile strength of Li metal. The relationship demonstrated provides a deeper understanding of the mechanical properties of the Li-electrolyte interface, which will play an important role in the design of batteries employing metallic Li anodes.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.072
Self-consolidation mechanism and its application in the preparation of Al-doped cubic Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2017For the preparation of high-density ceramic electrolytes, researchers prefer cold or hot isostatic pressing method, which is not cost effective because of the ultra-high pressure and poor productivity. In this paper, we present a novel “self-consolidation” method to prepare dense cubic Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) without the assist of pressing. The relative density of LLZO bulk sample is about 93–96%, and the 0.10 mol Al-doped sample with the purest cubic structure possesses the highest total ionic conductivity of 1.41 × 10− 4 S cm− 1 at 30 °C, which is comparable to the conductivities of the samples prepared by traditional high-pressure methods. Furthermore, a LLZO crystal unit cell model is constructed and the self-consolidation mechanism for LLZO from crystal unit cell to bulk is explored. The surface tension of the molten Li compounds acts as the intrinsic power for the self-consolidation. This work demonstrates a facile, productive and reliable route for the preparation of dense cubic LLZO, and provides an important insight into the microscopic consolidation mechanism of ceramic electrolytes.",Materials and Design,10.1021/acsami.7b17301
Origin of the Phase Transition in Lithium Garnets,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Molecular dynamic and density functional theory based simulations were performed to obtain a better understanding of the origin of phase transition in garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte. The phase transition coincided with the lithium redistribution among all sites. With the investigation of lithium distribution and dynamics, we found one temperature-dependent lithium migration pathway in lithium garnets. Lithium ions exhibited uniformly 3-dimensional diffusion in cubic LLZO, while the lithium diffusion in tetragonal LLZO was mainly in the a and b direction. The constrained diffusion in the c direction in tetragonal LLZO could be ascribed to the blocking effect of 16f sites which were found to be thermodynamically more stable than tetragonal 8a and 32g sites through density functional theory based calculations. Besides, the stabilizing effect of supervalent doping on cubic phase was also studied through Ta-doped LLZO. Further site occupancy investigations indicated that supervalent doping introduced lithium vacancies and reduced octahedral sites (tetragonal 16f and 32g sites) occupancy due to site energy preference. The reduced octahedral sites occupancy weakened the blocking effect of tetragonal 16f sites, promoted the lithium redistribution, and eventually lowered the phase transition temperature.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.12.133

New Insights into the Compositional Dependence of Li-Ion Transport in Polymer-Ceramic Composite Electrolytes,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Composite electrolytes are widely studied for their potential in realizing improved ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. Understanding the complex mechanisms of ion transport within composites is critical for effectively designing high-performance solid electrolytes. This study examines the compositional dependence of the three determining factors for ionic conductivity, including ion mobility, ion transport pathways, and active ion concentration. The results show that with increase in the fraction of ceramic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) phase in the LLZO-poly(ethylene oxide) composites, ion mobility decreases, ion transport pathways transit from polymer to ceramic routes, and the active ion concentration increases. These changes in ion mobility, transport pathways, and concentration collectively explain the observed trend of ionic conductivity in composite electrolytes. Liquid additives alter ion transport pathways and increase ion mobility, thus enhancing ionic conductivity significantly. It is also found that a higher content of LLZO leads to improved electrochemical stability of composite electrolytes. This study provides insight into the recurring observations of compositional dependence of ionic conductivity in current composite electrolytes and pinpoints the intrinsic limitations of composite electrolytes in achieving fast ion conduction.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1149/08513.0053ecst
Regulation mechanism of bottleneck size on Li+ migration activation energy in garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdThe garnet-type lithium ion conductor, nominal Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has received a lot of interest as they are considered usable as solid electrolytes in lithium battery. The Li+ migration bottleneck size of garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolyte are posed significant effect on Li+ transportation property. However, the regulation mechanism of the bottleneck size on the Li+ migration activation energy is not clear. In the study, equivalent substitution of tetravalent M4+ (M4+ = Ge4+, Ti4+, Sn4+, Hf4+ and Te4+) ions on Zr site of Li7La3M0.25Zr1.75O12 is designed to regulate the bottleneck size. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) is applied to detect the quantitative structural information of M-doped LLZO. Experimental and calculations results show that the M4+ substitution regulate the Li+ migration bottleneck size via changing M–O bond length. The M–O bond length increases with the increase of M4+ doping ion radius which results in the increase of the bottleneck size. However, larger bottleneck size is not necessarily favorable for Li+ migration. Ge4+ and Ti4+ doped LLZO have smaller bottleneck size than the un-doped LLZO, which is more suitable for Li+ migration (corresponds to lower Ea of 0.28 eV, 0.29 eV, respectively). This study is of great significance for obtaining optimum lithium ion migration channel size for LLZO, and the regulation mechanism is universality for crystal ion conductors.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1039/c8ta07241h

Enhanced electrochemical performance of bulk type oxide ceramic lithium batteries enabled by interface modification,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The interface issue is one of the severe problems in all-solid-state (ASS) batteries, especially for oxide-type batteries with a full ceramic structure. Rigid interfacial contact between electrodes and electrolyte and poor mechanical properties of ceramics limit the choices of applicable materials and fabrication processes for ASS batteries. In this report, a bulk type ASS lithium battery with an initial discharge capacity of 112.7 mA h g-1 is successfully fabricated. A garnet-structured Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LLZO-Ta) ceramic pellet is used as the solid electrolyte. A slurry of a composite cathode consisting of Li[Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3]O2, In2(1-x)Sn2xO3, Li3BO3, and polyvinylidene fluoride was tape-cast on the LLZO-Ta pellet and annealed to improve the interfacial contact among the particles in the composite cathode as well as between the composite cathode and the electrolyte pellet. Without the surface modification of a Li[Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3]O2 active material, an obvious degradation of discharge capacity due to polarization is observed during cycling. When a layer of a Li-Ti-O precursor is coated on the surface of Li[Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3]O2 particles, in situ spinel Li[Ti0.1Mn0.9]2O4 is formed at the surface after annealing, leading to an enhancement of discharge capacity of the battery and great improvement for cycling stability. This novel method of interface modification reduces the interfacial polarization with an enhanced Li+ transfer between the cathode and the electrolyte. Our experimental results reveal that the interface engineering by means of reasonable regulation on the surface constituent of electrode materials can effectively improve the capacity and cycling stability of ASS lithium batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.11.164
Preparation and properties nanomaterials for all-solid-state li-ion battery via a mechanochemical route,"A short overview is given on the rationalization of preparative processes of complex oxide nanoparticles for an all-solid-state Li-ion battery (SLIB). After a brief introduction associated with mechanochemical effects as a background, merits of combining mechanical activation and subsequent chemical treatments for the synthesis of complex oxide nanoparticles are emphasized. Mechanical stressing on the stoichiometric mixture of all the ingredients at an appropriate stage significantly reduces the subsequent calcination temperature. It is necessary for attaining high crystallinity and phase purity, while suppressing grain growth. A precursor with preformed embryos or nuclei is appropriate for subsequent low temperature solid-state synthesis. This is realized by careful choice of the starting ingredients and sparing mechanical stressing, usually exerted by a grinding mill. The procedure leads to complex oxide materials with high crystallinity and small particle size, simultaneously. Such properties are suitable for the application to electronic devices and SLIB. The entire techniques are associated with an extended concept of mechanochemistry.

Low-temperature fabrication for transparency Mg doping Li7La3Zr2O12 solid state electrolyte,"© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), which is one of the most promising solid electrolytes, has received great attention toward development of all solid-state lithium ion batteries in recently years due to its high lithium ion conductivity and relative stability against lithium metal at room temperature. However, high sintering-temperature goes against the processing and application of LLZO. Meanwhile, high sintering-temperature will exert great impact on composition and electric property of LLZO for volatilization of Li2O. In this study, LLZO is fabricated by doping with Mg to decrease sintering-temperature. Experimental results show that the sintering-temperature of Mg doping LLZO is reduced to 1000 °C, lower about ∼230 °C than that of LLZO. And the sintering-time is shorten to 12 h, reducing about 24 h. In addition, Mg doping LLZO exhibits well stability to lithium metal between 0 and 4.8 V, and exhibits 10–12% transparency to visible light from 500 to 800 nm.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.08.130
Solid polymer electrolytes incorporating cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 for all-solid-state lithium rechargeable batteries,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdThe advantages of all-solid-state batteries in terms of high energy density and improved safety have accelerated the research into durable and reliable solid electrolytes and into scale up of their processing technology. High lithium-ion-conducting Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramic-based solid electrolytes have been intensively studied recently, but their widespread commercial deployment has been constrained due to their fragility and brittleness. In the present study, LLZO ceramic powders have been successfully incorporated into the polyethylene oxide (PEO) polymer by tape casting. The ionic conductivity of the PEO/LLZO composite electrolyte membranes is significantly enhanced at the optimal LLZO concentration of 7.5 wt.% at which the materials exhibits maximum ionic conductivity of 5.5 × 10−4 S·cm−1 at 30 °C. The ionic conductivity enhancement mechanism of the composite electrolyte is revealed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which shows that the LLZO filler represses crystallinity in PEO. Furthermore, as evidence of the advantageous electrochemical properties of the composite electrolyte an all-solid-state battery of LiFePO4/Li fabricated herein delivered a maximum discharge capacity of 150.1 mAh·g−1 at 0.1C, good cycling performance, and excellent rate capability under 60 °C.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.020
Grain Boundary Contributions to Li-Ion Transport in the Solid Electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO),"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The oxide with nominal composition Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a promising solid electrolyte thanks to its high (bulk) Li-ion conductivity, negligible electronic transport, chemical stability against Li metal, and wide electrochemical window. Despite these promising characteristics, recent measurements suggest that microstructural features, specifically, grain boundaries (GBs), contribute to undesirable short-circuiting and resistance in polycrystalline LLZO membranes. Toward the goal of understanding GB-related phenomena, the present study characterizes the energetics, composition, and transport properties of three low-energy (ς3 and ς5) symmetric tilt GBs in LLZO at the atomic scale. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the GB planes are enriched with Li, and to a lesser extent with oxygen. Molecular dynamics simulations on these off-stoichiometric boundaries were used to assess Li-ion transport within and across the boundary planes. We find that Li transport is generally reduced in the GB region; however, the magnitude of this effect is sensitive to temperature and GB structure. Li-ion diffusion is comparable in all three GBs at the high temperatures encountered during processing, and only 2-3 times slower than bulk diffusion. These similarities vanish at room temperature, where diffusion in the more compact ς3 boundary remains relatively fast (half the bulk rate), while transport in the ς5 boundaries is roughly 2 orders of magnitude slower. These trends mirror the activation energies for diffusion, which in the ς5 boundaries are up to 35% larger than in bulk LLZO, and are identical to the bulk in the ς3 boundary. Diffusion within the ς5 boundaries is observed to be isotropic. In contrast, intraplane diffusion in the ς3 boundary plane at room temperature is predicted to exceed that of the bulk, while transboundary diffusion is ∼200 times slower than that in the bulk. Our observation of mixed GB transport contributions (some boundaries support fast diffusion, while others are slow) is consistent with the limited GB resistance observed in polycrystalline LLZO samples processed at high temperatures. These data also suggest that higher-energy GBs with less-compact structures should penalize Li-ion conductivity to a greater degree.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b03002
"Nanostructured Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12: Synthesis, Properties, and Opportunities as Electrolytes for Li-ion Batteries","© 2017 Elsevier LtdThe garnet-type Li+ ion conductor Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a promising candidate as a solid electrolyte for all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. Significant progress towards understanding the structure and properties of LLZO, conventionally synthesized using solid state reaction methods, has already been made in the last decade. The aim of this review is to summarize recent efforts on the synthesis of nanostructured LLZO, with a focus on electrospinning, cellulose templating, and low-temperature (< 900 °C) sol-gel based methods, as well as to highlight the unique properties of nano-sized LLZO. Further research is still needed to fully understand the potential benefits of using nanostructured LLZO in pellet-type, ceramic electrolytes, but a natural opportunity for nanostructured LLZO is in the role of ceramic filler within solid composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). The current status of CPEs embedded with LLZO ceramic fillers is summarized, including the elucidation of Li+ transport pathways using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.",Electrochimica Acta,10.1021/acsami.7b03806
Low temperature pulsed laser deposition of garnet Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 films as all solid-state lithium battery electrolytes,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.With its stability against Li and good ionic conductivity, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has emerged as a promising electrolyte material for lithium-based solid-state batteries (SSBs). Thin layers of solid electrolyte are needed to enable the practical use of SSBs. We report the first deposition of Li-conductive crystalline Ta-doped LLZO thin films on MgO (100) substrates via pulsed laser deposition. Further, we investigate the impact of laser fluence, deposition temperature (in the 50 °C–700 °C range), and post-deposition annealing on the structural, compositional, and transport properties of the film. We analyze the structure of the deposited films via grazing incident X-ray diffraction, their morphology via scanning electron microscopy, and the composition via depth profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The Li ionic conductivity is investigated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Contrary to previous reports for LLZO films, the crystalline Ta-doped films presents a pure cubic LLZO structure for deposition temperatures as low as 50 °C, with resulting conductivities not significantly influenced by the temperature deposition. Instead, the laser fluence has a major effect on the growth rate of the thin films.",Journal of Power Sources,10.4191/kcers.2017.54.4.02
Surface Chemistry Mechanism of Ultra-Low Interfacial Resistance in the Solid-State Electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The impact of surface chemistry on the interfacial resistance between the Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid-state electrolyte and a metallic Li electrode is revealed. Control of surface chemistry allows the interfacial resistance to be reduced to 2 Ω cm2, lower than that of liquid electrolytes, without the need for interlayer coatings. A mechanistic understanding of the origins of ultra-low resistance is provided by quantitatively evaluating the linkages between interfacial chemistry, Li wettability, and electrochemical phenomena. A combination of Li contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), first-principles calculations, and impedance spectroscopy demonstrates that the presence of common LLZO surface contaminants, Li2CO3 and LiOH, result in poor wettability by Li and high interfacial resistance. On the basis of this mechanism, a simple procedure for removing these surface layers is demonstrated, which results in a dramatic increase in Li wetting and the elimination of nearly all interfacial resistance. The low interfacial resistance is maintained over one-hundred cycles and suggests a straightforward pathway to achieving high energy and power density solid-state batteries.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1007/s10832-017-0079-9
Composite Polymer Electrolytes with Li7La3Zr2O12 Garnet-Type Nanowires as Ceramic Fillers: Mechanism of Conductivity Enhancement and Role of Doping and Morphology,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Composite polymer solid electrolytes (CPEs) containing ceramic fillers embedded inside a polymer-salt matrix show great improvements in Li+ ionic conductivity compared to the polymer electrolyte alone. Lithium lanthanum zirconate (Li7La3Zr2O12, LLZO) with a garnet-type crystal structure is a promising solid Li+ conductor. We show that by incorporating only 5 wt % of the ceramic filler comprising undoped, cubic-phase LLZO nanowires prepared by electrospinning, the room temperature ionic conductivity of a polyacrylonitrile-LiClO4-based composite is increased 3 orders of magnitude to 1.31 × 10-4 S/cm. Al-doped and Ta-doped LLZO nanowires are also synthesized and utilized as fillers, but the conductivity enhancement is similar as for the undoped LLZO nanowires. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies show that LLZO NWs partially modify the PAN polymer matrix and create preferential pathways for Li+ conduction through the modified polymer regions. CPEs with LLZO nanoparticles and Al2O3 nanowire fillers are also studied to elucidate the role of filler type (active vs passive), LLZO composition (undoped vs doped), and morphology (nanowire vs nanoparticle) on the CPE conductivity. It is demonstrated that both intrinsic Li+ conductivity and nanowire morphology are needed for optimal performance when using 5 wt % of the ceramic filler in the CPE.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1007/s10832-016-0058-6
Preparation and characterization of Ta-substituted Li7La3Zr2-xO12 garnet solid electrolyte by sol-gel processing,"In this work, Ta-substituted Li7La3Zr2-xO12 (LLZTO) powder and pellets with garnet cubic structure were fabricated and characterized by modified and optimized sol-gel synthesis. Ta-substituted LLZO powder with the smallest grain size and pure cubic structure with little pyrochlore phase was obtained by synthesis method in which Li and La sources in propanol solvent were mixed together with Zr and Ta sources in 2-methoxy ethanol. The LLZTO pellets made with the prepared powder showed cubic garnet structure for all conditions when the amount of Li addition was varied from 6.2 to 7.4 mol. All the X-ray peaks of the pyrochlore phase disappeared when the Li addition was increased above 7.0 mol. When the final sintering temperature was varied, the LLZTO pellet had a pyrochlore-mixed cubic phase above 1000oC. However, the surface morphology became much denser when the final sintering temperature was increased. The sol-gel-driven LLZTO pellet with a sintering temperature of 1100oC showed a lithium ionic conductivity of 0.21 mS/cm when Au was adopted as electrode material for the blocking capacitor. The results of this study suggest that modified sol-gel synthesis is the optimum method to obtain cubic phase of LLZTO powder for highly dense and conductive solid electrolyte ceramics.",Journal of the Korean Ceramic Society,10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00221
Boosting the electrochemical performance of Li-garnet based all-solid-state batteries with Li4Ti5O12 electrode: Routes to cheap and large scale ceramic processing,"© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.All-solid-state batteries based on fast Li+ conducting solid electrolytes such as Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) give perspective on safe, non-inflammable, and temperature tolerant energy storage. Despite the promise, ceramic processing of whole battery assemblies reaching close to theoretical capacities and finding optimal strategies to process large-scale and low cost battery cells remains a challenge. Here, we tackle these issues and report on a solid-state battery cell composed of Li4Ti5O12 / c-Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 / metallic Li delivering capacities around 70–75 Ah/kg with reversible cycling at a rate of 8 A/kg (for 2.5–1.0 V, 95 °C). A key aspect towards the increase in capacity and Li+ transfer at the solid electrolyte-electrode interface is found to be the intimate embedding of grains and their connectivity, which can be implemented by the isostatic pressing of cells during their preparation. We suggest that simple adaption of ceramic processing, such as the applied pressure during processing, strongly alters the electrochemical performance by assuring good grain contacts at the electrolyte-electrode interface. Among the garnet-type all-solid-state ceramic battery assemblies in the field, considerably improved capacities and cycling properties are demonstrated for Li4Ti5O12 / c-Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 / metallic Li pressed cells, giving new perspectives on cheap ceramic processing and up-scalable garnet-based all-solid-state batteries.",Journal of Electroceramics,10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b00944
Microelectrodes for local conductivity and degradation measurements on Al stabilized Li7La3Zr2O12 garnets,"© 2016, The Author(s).The attractiveness of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) cubic based garnets lies in their high ionic conductivity and the combination of thermal and electrochemical stability. However, relations between composition and conductivity as well as degradation effects are still not completely understood. In this contribution we demonstrate the applicability of microelectrodes (Ø = 20–300 μm) for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies on LLZO garnets. Microelectrodes allow to obtain local information on the ionic conductivity. A comparison between the overall performance of the sample (3.3 × 10−4 S cm−1) and local measurements revealed differences in conductivity with a maximum of the locally measured values of 6.3 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a minimum of 2.6 × 10−4 S cm−1. One reason behind these conductivity variations is most probably a compositional gradient in the sample. In addition, microelectrodes are very sensitive to conductivity changes near to the surface. This was used to investigate the effect of moisture in ambient air on the conductivity variations of LLZO. Substantial changes of the measured Li-ion transport resistance were found, particularly for smaller microelectrodes which probe sample volumes close to the surface.",Journal of Electroceramics,10.1021/acsami.7b00614
Solid-State Lithium-Sulfur Batteries Operated at 37 °C with Composites of Nanostructured Li7La3Zr2O12/Carbon Foam and Polymer,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.An all solid-state lithium-ion battery with high energy density and high safety is a promising solution for a next-generation energy storage system. High interface resistance of the electrodes and poor ion conductivity of solid-state electrolytes are two main challenges for solid-state batteries, which require operation at elevated temperatures of 60-90 °C.

Atomic Layer Deposition of the Solid Electrolyte Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Lithium solid electrolytes are a promising platform for achieving high energy density, long-lasting, and safe rechargeable batteries, which could have widespread societal impact. In particular, the ceramic oxide garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has been shown to be a promising electrolyte due to its stability and high ionic conductivity. Two major challenges for commercialization are the manufacture of thin layers and the creation of stable, low-impedance interfaces with both anode and cathode materials. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has recently been shown to be a powerful method for depositing both solid electrolytes and interfacial layers to improve the stability and performance at electrode-electrolyte interfaces in battery systems. Herein, we present a thermal ALD process for LLZO, demonstrating the ability to tune composition within the amorphous as-deposited film, which is studied using in situ quartz crystal microbalance measurements. Postannealing using a variety of substrates and gas environments was performed, and the formation of the cubic phase was observed at temperatures as low as 555 °C, significantly lower than what is required for bulk processing. Additionally, challenges associated with achieving a dense garnet phase due to substrate reactivity, morphology changes, and Li loss under the necessary high-temperature annealing are quantified via in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1021/jacs.6b13344
Garnet-Type Fast Li-Ion Conductors with High Ionic Conductivities for All-Solid-State Batteries,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.All-solid-state Li-ion batteries with metallic Li anodes and solid electrolytes could offer superior energy density and safety over conventional Li-ion batteries. However, compared with organic liquid electrolytes, the low conductivity of solid electrolytes and large electrolyte/electrode interfacial resistance impede their practical application. Garnet-type Li-ion conducting oxides are among the most promising electrolytes for all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. In this work, the large-radius Rb is doped at the La site of cubic Li6.10Ga0.30La3Zr2O12 to enhance the Li-ion conductivity for the first time. The Li6.20Ga0.30La2.95Rb0.05Zr2O12 electrolyte exhibits a Li-ion conductivity of 1.62 mS cm-1 at room temperature, which is the highest conductivity reported until now. All-solid-state Li-ion batteries are constructed from the electrolyte, metallic Li anode, and LiFePO4 active cathode. The addition of Li(CF3SO2)2N electrolytic salt in the cathode effectively reduces the interfacial resistance, allowing for a high initial discharge capacity of 152 mAh g-1 and good cycling stability with 110 mAh g-1 retained after 20 cycles at a charge/discharge rate of 0.05 C at 60 °C.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsenergylett.6b00593
"Toward garnet electrolyte–based Li metal batteries: An ultrathin, highly effective, artificial solid-state electrolyte/metallic Li interface","2017 © The Authors.Solid-state batteries are a promising option toward high energy and power densities due to the use of lithium (Li) metal as an anode. Among all solid electrolyte materials ranging from sulfides to oxides and oxynitrides, cubic garnet–type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramic electrolytes are superior candidates because of their high ionic conductivity (10?3 to 10?4 S/cm) and good stability against Li metal. However, garnet solid electrolytes generally have poor contact with Li metal, which causes high resistance and uneven current distribution at the interface. To address this challenge, we demonstrate a strategy to engineer the garnet solid electrolyte and the Li metal interface by forming an intermediary Li-metal alloy, which changes the wettability of the garnet surface (lithi-ophobic to lithiophilic) and reduces the interface resistance by more than an order of magnitude: 950 ohm·cm2 for the pristine garnet/Li and 75 ohm·cm2 for the surface-engineered garnet/Li. Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 (LLCZN) was selected as the solid-state electrolyte (SSE) in this work because of its low sintering temperature, stabilized cubic garnet phase, and high ionic conductivity. This low area-specific resistance enables a solid-state garnet SSE/Li metal configuration and promotes the development of a hybrid electrolyte system. The hybrid system uses the improved solid-state garnet SSE Li metal anode and a thin liquid electrolyte cathode interfacial layer. This work provides new ways to address the garnet SSE wetting issue against Li and get more stable cell performances based on the hybrid electrolyte system for Li-ion, Li-sulfur, and Li-oxygen batteries toward the next generation of Li metal batteries.",Science Advances,10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b10268
In Situ Atomic-Scale Observation of Electrochemical Delithiation Induced Structure Evolution of LiCoO2 Cathode in a Working All-Solid-State Battery,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.We report a method for in situ atomic-scale observation of electrochemical delithiation in a working all-solid-state battery using a state-of-the-art chip based in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) holder and focused ion beam milling to prepare an all-solid-state lithium-ion battery sample. A battery consisting of LiCoO2 cathode, LLZO solid state electrolyte and gold anode was constructed, delithiated and observed in an aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscope at atomic scale. We found that the pristine single crystal LiCoO2 became nanosized polycrystal connected by coherent twin boundaries and antiphase domain boundaries after high voltage delithiation. This is different from liquid electrolyte batteries, where a series of phase transitions take place at LiCoO2 cathode during delithiation. Both grain boundaries become more energy favorable along with extraction of lithium ions through theoretical calculation. We also proposed a lithium migration pathway before and after polycrystallization. This new methodology could stimulate atomic scale in situ scanning/TEM studies of battery materials and provide important mechanistic insight for designing better all-solid-state battery.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1007/978-3-319-52132-9_12
Electrochemical Window of the Li-Ion Solid Electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The recent discovery of fast ion-conducting solid electrolytes could enable solid-state and other advanced battery chemistries with higher energy densities and enhanced safety. In addition to high ionic conductivity, a viable electrolyte should also exhibit an electrochemical window that is wide enough to suppress undesirable electronic transport (i.e., self-discharge and/or short circuiting) arising from charge injection or extraction from the electrodes. Here, direct current chronoamperometry, alternating current electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and optical absorption band gap measurements are combined with first-principles calculations to systematically characterize the electrochemical window of the promising superionic conductor Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). Negligible electronic current was measured within LLZO for a wide range of voltages relevant for high-voltage cathodes. This auspicious behavior is consistent with both the large band gap (∼6 eV) predicted for LLZO and the absolute positions of its band edges. These features imply that a wide electrochemical window is an intrinsic property of LLZO, facilitating its use in next-generation batteries.",ACS Energy Letters,10.3934/matersci.2017.4.867
Li/Li7La3Zr2O12/LiFePO4 all-solid-state battery with ultrathin nanoscale solid electrolyte,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.We introduced the nanoconcept in the oxide solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). All-solid-state Li/LiFePO4 (LFPO) cell using this solid electrolyte with thickness of several micrometers was assembled with appropriate solvent, dispersant, adhesives, and surfactant without cold- or hot-pressing. At room temperature, the Li/LLZO/LFPO cell showed the first discharge capacity of 160.4 mAh g-1, which was 94.4% of the theoretical capacity of LFPO, and the cell provided a discharge capacity of 136.8 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles. At 60 °C, the battery presented more stable electrochemical performance. The capacity loss during cycles 2-100 was only 0.06% (0.7 mAh g-1). The excellent performance could be attributed to the ultrathin solid electrolyte film. (Graph Presented).",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1149/2.0381712jes
Effect of Mo6+ substitution on microstructure and lithium ionic conductivity of garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolytes by field assisted sintering technology,"© 2017, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.Advanced rechargeable lithium batteries with high energy density are required as power sources for electric or modern storage systems. Solid-state batteries with non-flammable inorganic solid electrolytes are one candidate to replace the currently-used liquid electrolyte. In recent years, a novel class of inorganic ceramic solid electrolyte with garnet structure Li7La3Zr2O12, known as LLZO, has been developed, which has several superior advantages, such as high Li-ion conductivity, high chemical and electrochemical stability in air. However, Li-ion conductivity for LLZO solid electrolyte is still too low to be applied in the industry. In order to obtain high Li-ion conductivity of LLZO, the priority is to stabilize its cubic phase, because the conductivity of tetragonal phase is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the cubic phase. Previous studies indicated that elemental doping was an effective means to stabilize the cubic phase as well as increase the density of ceramic samples, especially with Al3+. It can not only substitutes the corresponding element in the lattice but also helps expel pores through low melting-point phase formed at grain boundaries, which leads to a good connection between the cubic grains. In addition, Mo (normally Mo6+) substitution for Zr4+ may lead to more Li vacancies in LLZO, which is beneficial to the enhancement of ionic conductivity. In this study, Mo6+ doped Li6.5La3Zr1.75Mo0.25O12 (LLZM) solid electrolytes are successfully prepared via field assisted sintering technology (FAST). The effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure and lithium ionic conductivity is mainly investigated. The results show that pure cubic phase LLZM can be obtained at the range of temperatures from 1050 to 1150 °C for no more than 10 min. For the sample sintered at 1150 °C, a maximum relative density of >95% with a total ionic conductivity as high as 1.3 × 10−4 S cm−1 are obtained at room temperature. The change of ionic conductivity is ascribed to the smaller ionic size of Mo6+ (0.62 Å) to Zr4+ (0.72 Å). The higher valence of Mo6+ to Zr4+ can reduce the Li+ concentration and stabilize the cubic phase.","Minerals, Metals and Materials Series",10.1039/c7ta06790a
Electrode-electrolyte interface stability in solid state electrolyte systems: Influence of coating thickness under varying residual stresses,"© 2017, Claas Hüter, et al.We introduce a model of electrode-electrolyte interfacial growth which focuses on the effect of thin coating layers on the interfacial stability in prestressed systems. We take into account transport resulting from deposition from the electrolyte, from capillarity driven surface diffiusion, and from changes of the chemical potential due to the elastic energy associated with the interface profile. As model system, we use metallic lithium as electrode, LLZO as electrolyte and Al2O3 as a thin film interlayer, which is a highly relevant interfacial system in state of the art all-solid-electrolyte batteries. We consider the stability of the electrode-coating-electrolyte interface depending on the thickness of the thin film interlayer and the magnitude of the elastic prestresses. Our central approach is a linear stability analysis based on the mass conservation at the planar interface, employing approximations which are appropriate for solid state electrolytes (SSEs) like LLZ, a thin Li metal electrode and a thin coating layer with a thickness in the range of nanometres.",AIMS Materials Science,10.1149/07711.0509ecst
Impedance spectroscopy analysis of the lithium ion transport through the Li7La3Zr2O12/P(EO)20Li interface,"© 2017 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.Model systems for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies of solid-state electrolytes based on ceramic lithium ion conductor Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and polymer electrolyte P(EO)20-LiClO4 are investigated for the first time. The aim of the present study is to identify and quantify the lithium ion transition resistance of the ceramic/polymer interface. Symmetrical model systems consisting of LLZO pellets with sheets of P(EO)20-LiClO4 are manufactured and investigated in detail. In such symmetric model systems we observed an additional ion-transfer process, which we attributed to the interface processes (i.e. distributed Li+ transition across the interface). Based on the EIS measurement data obtained above the polymer electrolyte’s melting temperature, at 70°C the interface resistance of the lithium ion transition is estimated to be ∼9 kΩ cm2 and the capacitance of the process is in the order of 0.1 μF/cm2. According to our investigations, it is possible to predict interface resistivity of lithium ion transport for different polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes for solid state lithium battery applications.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1039/c7ta03162a

Controlling and correlating the effect of grain size with the mechanical and electrochemical properties of Li7La3Zr2O12 solid-state electrolyte,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid-state electrolyte is garnering interest due to its potential to enable solid-state batteries (SSBs) using metallic Li anodes. However, Li metal propagates along LLZO grain boundaries at high Li plating current densities (above the critical current density, CCD). In the present study, we examined whether microstructural aspects, such as grain size, could influence mechanical and electrochemical properties thereby affecting the CCD. A unique densification technique (heating between 1100 and 1300 °C) was used to control grain size. Electron backscatter diffraction determined that the grain size and the misorientation angle varied from 5 to 600 μm and 20 to 40°, respectively. Vickers indentation was used to characterize the mechanical properties and revealed that hardness decreased (9.9-6.8 GPa) with increasing grain size, but the fracture toughness was invariant (0.6 MPa m-1/2) at grain sizes ≥40 μm. DC and AC techniques were used to measure and correlate the CCD with grain size and showed that the CCD increased with increasing grain size achieving a maximum of 0.6 mA cm-2. We believe the implications of this work could be far-reaching in that they represent a significant step towards understanding the mechanism(s) that control the stability of the Li-LLZO interface and a rational approach to increase the CCD in SSBs.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1149/2.1501707jes

For a SSB to be viable, the stability and charge transfer kinetics at the Li-LLZO interface should foster facile plating and stripping of Li. Contrary to these goals, recent studies have reported high Li-LLZO interfacial resistance which was attributed to a contamination layer that forms upon exposure of LLZO to air. This study clarifies the mechanisms and consequences associated with air exposure of LLZO; additionally, strategies to minimize these effects are described. First-principles calculations reveal that LLZO readily reacts with humid air; the most favorable reaction pathway involves protonation of LLZO and formation of Li2CO3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the surface and subsurface chemistry of LLZO as a function of relative humidity and exposure time. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to measure the Li-LLZO interfacial resistance as a function of surface contamination. These data indicate that air exposure-induced contamination impacts the interfacial resistance significantly, when exposure time exceeds 24 h. The results of this study provide valuable insight into the sensitivity of LLZO to air and how the effects of air contamination can be reversed.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.04.014
Thick-films of garnet-type lithium ion conductor prepared by the Aerosol Deposition Method: The role of morphology and annealing treatment on the ionic conductivity,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.We fabricated thick films of cubic garnet solid electrolyte AlyLi7-3y-zLa3Zr2-zTazO12 (ALLZTO) by the Aerosol Deposition Method (ADM). Due to the room temperature impact consolidation (RTIC) mechanism, the films become dense. A thermal post-treatment of the film revealed the morphological and process-related impact on the ionic conductivity. As-deposited films show a reduced conductivity around 2·10−7 S/cm. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and high-temperature X-ray diffraction, we found the lattice distortion and nano-crystallinity of the films to be the decisive effect for the conductivity reduction. In our case, post-deposition annealing at 400 °C lead to an increase of the ionic conductivity to 2·10−5 S/cm. With a beginning of sintering at 600 °C, the conductivity successively increased further, reaching values of 7·10−5 S/cm.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.03.126
High capacity all-solid-state lithium battery using cathodes with three-dimensional Li+ conductive network,"© The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.All-solid-state lithium batteries (ASLBs) have been dramatically attracted recently for its ability of solving the safety issues in traditional lithium ion batteries using liquid electrolyte. However the poor Li+ transportation between the active material particles in the cathode greatly deteriorate the specific capacity of ASLBs. Herein, we design a composite cathode composed of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and LiCoO2 (LCO) in which a three-dimensional (3D) continuous Li+ conductive network forms. With the decrease of the LCO: PEO ratio, the 3D Li+ conductive network gradually becomes continuous, and the corresponding discharge capacity increase from 50 to 136 mAh g−1. At LCO: PEO = 6: 1 and 4: 1, the corresponding ASLBs has a very high discharge capacity of 136 and 124 mAh g−1, respectively, representing approximately 98% and 90% of the theoretical discharge capacity. The capacity retention after 5 cycles is 97%-98% of the 2nd cycle, which confirms stable cycle performance of the battery. The FTIR results show that, in the composite cathode, the LCO particles transport Li+ cations by coordinating CO functional group in PEO chains. Compared with other optimized ASLBs based on LLZO solid elctrolyte, our battery has higher specific capacity while being tested under the highest current rate.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.11.277
Enhanced electrochemical performance of Li3V2(PO4)3/C coated with Li fast ion conductive Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2017 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.Li7La3Zr2O12-coated Li3V2(PO4)3/C (LLZO-coated LVP/C) has been synthesized via a conventional sol-gel method, in which LLZO as the fast Li-ion conductor and carbon as the mixed coating with excellent electronic conductivity could enhance the transport of both electrons and Li-ions at the electrode's surface. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) have been performed to prove the existence of LLZO on the surface of LVP. The valence states of the La and Zr elements are investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The capacity retention rates of LVP/C and LLZO-coated LVP/C after 100 cycles at 0.5C are 75.7% and 83.4%, respectively. Besides, the LLZO-coated LVP/C exhibits a specific discharge capacity of 161 mA h g-1 at 0.1C and 95 mA h g-1 at 5C at the voltage range of 3.0-4.8 V (vs Li+/Li), respectively. The superior electrochemical performance of LLZO-coated LVP/C can contribute to two aspects as follows: (1) LLZO coating provides a chemically stable layer which effectively reduces the chemical reactions between the active material and the electrolyte; (2) Compared with the uncoated LVP/C, the ionic conductivity of LLZO-coated LVP/C increases which is proved by the results of CV and GITT. Thus, we believe that the synthesis strategy of LLZO or other solid-state electrolytes and carbon hybrid coating could be employed to develop other cathode materials for their application in power lithium ion battery.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1149/2.0201701jes
Electrochemical performance of a solvent-free hybrid ceramic-polymer electrolyte based on Li7La3Zr2O12 in P(EO)15LiTFSI,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.The preparation of hybrid ceramic-polymer electrolytes, consisting of 70 wt% of Li+ cation conducting Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and 30 wt% of P(EO)15LiTFSI polymer electrolyte, through a solvent-free procedure is reported. The LLZO-P(EO)15LiTFSI hybrid electrolytes exhibit remarkable improvement in terms of flexibility and processability with respect to pure LLZO ceramic electrolytes. The physicochemical and electrochemical investigation shows the effect of LLZO annealing, resulting in ion conduction gain. However, slow charge transfer at the ceramic-polymer interface is also observed especially at higher temperatures. Nevertheless, improved compatibility with lithium metal anodes and good Li stripping/plating behavior are exhibited by the LLZO-P(EO)15LiTFSI hybrid electrolytes with respect to P(EO)15LiTFSI.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.01.088
Key parameters governing the densification of cubic-Li7La3Zr2O12 Li+ conductors,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.Cubic-Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is regarded as one of the most promising solid electrolytes for the construction of inherently safe, next generation all-solid-state Li batteries. Unfortunately, sintering these materials to full density with controlled grain sizes, mechanical and electrochemical properties relies on energy and equipment intensive processes. In this work, we elucidate key parameters dictating LLZO densification by tracing the compositional and structural changes during processing calcined and ball-milled Al3+ doped LLZO powders. We find that the powders undergo ion (Li+/H+) exchange during room temperature processing, such that on heating, the protonated LLZO lattice collapses and crystallizes to its constituent oxides, leading to reaction driven densification at < 1000 °C, prior to sintering of LLZO grains at higher temperatures. It is shown that small particle sizes and protonation cannot be decoupled, and actually aid densification. We conclude that using fully decomposed nanoparticle mixtures, as obtained by liquid-feed flame spray pyrolysis, provides an ideal approach to use high surface and reaction energy to drive densification, resulting in pressureless sintering of Ga3+ doped LLZO thin films (25 μm) at 1130 °C/0.3 h to ideal microstructures (95 ± 1% density, 1.2 ± 0.2 μm average grain size) normally accessible only by pressure-assisted sintering. Such films offer both high ionic conductivity (1.3 ± 0.1 mS cm−1) and record low ionic area specific resistance (2 Ω cm2).",Journal of Power Sources,10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b01032
Ga-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12: An investigation based on grain coarsening in garnet-type lithium ion conductors,"© 2016 Elsevier B.V.Gallium substituted garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12has been synthesized via a sol-gel (SG) and solid-state reaction (SSR) routes. The results of scanning electron spectroscopy measurements showed that the SG process produced statistically smaller powder particles than the SSR route. A structural transformation from tetragonal to cubic phase occurs at an elevated level of Gallium doping, resulting in a cubic structure for Li5.5La3Zr2Ga0.5O12(0.5Ga-LLZO). To facilitate the comparison of sintering procedures, powders of Ga-doped LLZO were sintered by both a conventional sintering process and a spark plasma sintering (SPS) process. For pellets sintered by SPS at 950 °C for 5 min, grain coarsening was limited due to the short sintering duration. However, grain coarsening was observed in the SPS pellets sintered at 950 °C, 1000 °C, and 1100 °C for 5 h in air. The ionic conductivity was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at temperatures in the range of 20 °C–100 °C. The total ionic conductivity was found to increase with increased relative density and larger grain size. The highest total ionic conductivity at room temperature was found to be in the range of 5.81 × 10−5S/cm (Ea= 0.41 eV) in this work.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1039/c6nr06955j
Garnet-Type Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte thin films grown by CO2-laser assisted CVD for All-solid-state batteries,"© The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS.The detailed characterization of garnet-Type Li-ion conducting Li7La3Zr2O12 2 (LLZO) solid electrolyte thin films grown by novel CO2-laser assisted chemical vapor deposition (LA-CVD) is reported. A deposition process parameter study reveals that an optimal combination of deposition temperature and oxygen partial pressure is essential to obtain high quality tetragonal LLZO thin films. The polycrystalline tetragonal LLZO films grown on platinum have a dense and homogeneous microstructure and are free of cracks. A total lithium ion conductivity of 4.2 · 10-6 S · cm-1 at room temperature, with an activation energy of 0.50 eV, is achieved. This is the highest total lithium ion conductivity value reported for tetragonal LLZO thin films so far, being about one order of magnitude higher than previously reported values for tetragonal LLZO thin films prepared by sputtering and pulsed laser deposition. The results of this study suggest that the tetragonal LLZO thin films grown by LA-CVD are applicable for the use in all-solid-state thin film lithium ion batteries.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b03223
A novel method for preparation of high dense tetragonal Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.For conventional preparation methods of Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) solid state electrolytes, there is a stereotype that higher density always comes from higher pressure enforced upon the LLZO pellets. In this paper, a different way with an auto-consolidation mechanism is provided and discussed. No pressing operations are employed during the whole preparation process. Due to the surface tension of liquid melted Li2O at sintering temperature, LLZO particles could aggregate together freely and automatically. The preparation process for dense LLZO is greatly simplified. A dense tetragonal LLZO with high relative density about 93% has been prepared successfully by this auto-consolidation method. And there are no voids observed in the SEM images. At 30 °C, the total conductivity is about 5.67 × 10−5 S cm−1, which is the highest one for tetragonal LLZO in the reported issues, even two times higher than that prepared by hot-pressing method. The activation energy for total conductivity is ∼0.35 eV atom−1at 30–120 °C, slightly lower than the previous reported values. This work sheds light on the understanding of the consolidation mechanism for solid electrolytes and suggests a reliable route to syhthesize cemanic solid electrolytes.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b03870
Preparation of Nano- and Microstructured Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 Solid Electrolytes for Li-Ion Batteries via Cellulose Templating,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Lithium lanthanum zirconate (LLZO) is a promising Li+ ion conductor for applications as a ceramic solid electrolyte in all-solid-state lithium batteries. However, the tetragonal and cubic phases of LLZO differ in lithium ionic conductivity by several orders of magnitude with extrinsic dopants or nanostructuring often required to stabilize the high conductivity cubic phase at room temperature. Here, we show that nanostructured LLZO can be prepared by templating onto various cellulosic fibers, including laboratory Kimwipes, Whatman filter paper, and nanocellulose fibrils, followed by calcination at 700-800 °C. The effect of templating material, calcination temperature, calcination time, and heating ramp rate on the LLZO crystal structure and morphology were thoroughly investigated. Templating was determined to be an effective method for controlling the LLZO size and morphology, and low calcination times and ramp rates were found to favor the formation of small ligaments. Furthermore, it was verified that cubic phase stabilization occurred for LLZO with ligaments of size less than 1 μm on average without the use of extrinsic dopants. This work provides more information regarding the size dependence of cubic LLZO stabilization that was not previously investigated in detail, and cellulosic templating is shown to be a viable route toward the scalable, sustainable synthesis of LLZO solid electrolytes.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1016/j.materresbull.2016.02.040
Investigating the all-solid-state batteries based on lithium garnets and a high potential cathode-LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4,"©2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.All-solid-state Li-ion batteries based on lithium garnets give new prospects for safer battery operations avoiding liquids, and could enable the integration of high energy density electrode materials. Herein, we critically investigate the structural and chemical stability of the high voltage cathode material, LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4, based on the solid lithium garnet electrolyte LLZO (c-Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12) for all-solid Li-ion batteries. We manufacture battery cells based on nano-grained synthesized LLZO and composite cathodes (LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4/LLZO/C) fabricated via direct slurry casting of the cathode material and additives on sintered LLZO pellets against metallic Li anodes. The galvanostatic tests of such all-solid-state batteries up to 4.9 V at 95 °C reveal the incompatibility of the solid electrolyte and the cathode material under given conditions. Post-mortem analyses of the all-solid-state batteries demonstrate the formation of new inactive phases at the LLZO/LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 interfacial region through an irreversible reaction starting at ∼3.8 V during charging. The discovered limited chemical stability under the investigated conditions raises the question if LLZO could be a promising solid-electrolyte for future all-solid-state Li-ion batteries especially at higher operation potentials and demanding operation conditions.",Nanoscale,10.1002/aenm.201600736
Interfacial Stability of Li Metal-Solid Electrolyte Elucidated via in Situ Electron Microscopy,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Despite their different chemistries, novel energy-storage systems, e.g., Li-air, Li-S, all-solid-state Li batteries, etc., face one critical challenge of forming a conductive and stable interface between Li metal and a solid electrolyte. An accurate understanding of the formation mechanism and the exact structure and chemistry of the rarely existing benign interfaces, such as the Li-cubic-Li7-3xAlxLa3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO) interface, is crucial for enabling the use of Li metal anodes. Due to spatial confinement and structural and chemical complications, current investigations are largely limited to theoretical calculations. Here, through an in situ formation of Li-c-LLZO interfaces inside an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope, we successfully reveal the interfacial chemical and structural progression. Upon contact with Li metal, the LLZO surface is reduced, which is accompanied by the simultaneous implantation of Li+, resulting in a tetragonal-like LLZO interphase that stabilizes at an extremely small thickness of around five unit cells. This interphase effectively prevented further interfacial reactions without compromising the ionic conductivity. Although the cubic-to-tetragonal transition is typically undesired during LLZO synthesis, the similar structural change was found to be the likely key to the observed benign interface. These insights provide a new perspective for designing Li-solid electrolyte interfaces that can enable the use of Li metal anodes in next-generation batteries.",Nano Letters,10.1002/anie.201607539
Electrochemical Nature of the Cathode Interface for a Solid-State Lithium-Ion Battery: Interface between LiCoO2 and Garnet-Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Garnet-structured solid electrolytes have been extensively studied for a solid-state lithium rechargeable battery. Previous works have been mostly focused on the materials' development and basic electrochemical properties but not the cathode/electrolyte interface. Understanding the cathode interface is critical to enhance chemical stability and electrochemical performance of a solid-state battery cell. In this work, we studied thoroughly the cathode/electrolyte interface between LiCoO2 and Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). It was found that the high-temperature process to fuse LiCoO2 and LLZO induced cross-diffusion of elements and formation of the tetragonal LLZO phase at the interface. These degradations affected electrochemical performance, especially the initial Coulombic efficiency and cycle life. In a clean cathode interface without the thermal process, an irreversible electrochemical decomposition at > ∼ 3.0 V vs Li+/Li was identified. The decomposition was able to be avoided by a surface modification of LLZO (e.g., Co-diffused surface layer and/or presence of an interlayer, Li3BO3), and the surface modification was equally important to suppress a reaction during air storage. In a LiCoO2/LLZO interface, it is important to separate direct contacts between LiCoO2 and pure LLZO.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1080/10667857.2016.1196033
Low temperature synthesis of garnet type solid electrolyte by modified polymer complex process and its characterization,"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.Polycrystalline tetragonal and cubic with garnet related type structured Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has been successfully synthesized at 700 °C (tetragonal) and 1100 °C (cubic), respectively by modified polymer complex synthesis. Citric acid was used for a chelating agent and ethylene glycol was applied for polymer complex agent. Thermal analysis indicated that the crystallization has been completed at the low temperature in case of applying high energy ball-milling process. It is presumed that applied mechano-chemical energy promotes the earlier crystallization at lower temperature, which induces the reduction of particle size effectively. LLZOs with tetragonal and cubic phase showed ionic conductivities of 6.2 × 10-7 Scm-1 and 1.4 × 10-4 Scm-1, respectively.

Composite electrolytes have been prepared with cubic-phase Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) garnet and polyethylene oxide (PEO) and employed in symmetric lithium battery cells. By combining selective isotope labeling and high-resolution solid-state Li NMR, we are able to track Li ion pathways within LLZO-PEO composite electrolytes by monitoring the replacement of7Li in the composite electrolyte by6Li from the6Li metal electrodes during battery cycling. We have provided the first experimental evidence to show that Li ions favor the pathway through the LLZO ceramic phase instead of the PEO-LLZO interface or PEO.

In this study, an effect of Ru doping to Zr site on electrochemical properties of the cubic LLZO is examined. The Ru-doped LLZO is prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction using Ga as a stabilise agent for the cubic phase. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and electrochemical impedance are used to characterise it. A lattice constant of the Ru-doped LLZO decreases with increase in doping amount of Ru. Also, a formation of perovskite LaRuO3 is confirmed in the Ru-doped LLZO. The Li ion conductivity of the Ru-doped LLZO is higher than that of the pure LLZO. The highest ionic conductivity of 2.56 × 10−4 S/cm was obtained in Li7La3Zr1.6Ru0.4O12. A promotion of sintering and shrinkage of lattice constant by the Ru doping would be reason for the improvement of Li ion conductivity in the Ru-doped LLZO.",Materials Technology,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.03.197
"In-situ, non-destructive acoustic characterization of solid state electrolyte cells","© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Solid-state electrolytes such as cubic Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) can enable solid-state batteries, metallic lithium anodes and higher voltage cathodes. However, the stability of cubic LLZO is affected by current density. In beta alumina solid electrolyte, microstructural failure was caused by Na dendrite penetration, and was shown to be a function of the fracture toughness, KIC. The relationship between dendrite penetration and KIC indicates electronic failure is related to creation of microstructural damage, and the microstructural damage may be used as an indicator of imminent electronic failure. To monitor microstructural damage during cycling, we developed a non-invasive, in-situ cell monitoring apparatus to help to correlate mechanical stability with Li-ion current density in LLZO. A pulse-echo transducer was integrated into all solid-state Li-LLZO-Li cells. The capability enables the characterization of microscopic inhomogeneities through the careful measurement of changes to the elastic moduli. The elastic moduli and fracture toughness have been previously reported for dense (>99%) specimens, but monitoring of the relative change in moduli during cycling has not been explored. In this study, an acoustic monitoring method is presented to monitor LLZO specimens during cycling.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00579

Microstructure and temperature dependent lithium ion transport of ceramic-polymer composite electrolyte for solid-state lithium ion batteries based on garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12,"© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.In this paper we present the fabrication of a composite electrolyte for solid state batteries consisting of Al-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramic particles dispersed in a poly(ethylene oxide) (P(EO)20-LiClO4) matrix. The Al-substituted cubic garnet like LLZO solid-state electrolyte filler is obtained by wet-chemical synthesis followed by a solid state lithiation of the as-prepared amorphous mixed hydroxides. Combining both components LLZO powder can be processed directly into a bifunctional electrolyte-separator membrane eliminating any further ceramic processing steps. Homogeneous composite membranes with different ceramic/polymer composition ratio were obtained by tape casting method with ceramic filling up to 40 vol%. Due to addition of the LLZO ceramic filler the crystallinity of the polymer electrolyte matrix within the composites is greatly reduced, which is proved by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. It is further demonstrated that the lithium ion conductivity of the membranes strongly depends on the physical condition of the polymer electrolyte. Composite electrolytes show temperature dependent lithium ion conductivity behaviour similar to polymer electrolyte. Ionic conductivity of the composite ceramic/polymer membranes is analysed by impedance spectroscopy and it falls between 7-10- 9 S/cm at 20 °C and 5-10- 5 S/cm at 80 °C for a composite with 40 vol% LLZO.",Solid State Ionics,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.01.086
Al stabilized Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolytes for all-solid state Li-ion batteries,"© 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCAll Solid State Lithium Ion Batteries (ASS-LIB) have been attracting great attention due to their high temperature stability, energy density and safety. Cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramic electrolyte is one of the most studied solid electrolyte because of its exceptionally high chemical stability against Li metal, air and moisture, thermal stability and very competitive ionic conductivity. In order to stabilize cubic LLZO, relatively high temperatures are required. On the other hand, it's possible to decrease sintering temperature and time with a stabilizer addition. In this study, 20–30 mol % Al containing LLZO electrolytes were prepared by solid state reaction method at varying sintering temperatures (1100 °C and 1150 °C) for varying sintering times (12 h and 24 h) and the characterization of resultant materials were carried out. XRD results showed that, small amount of other compounds such as LaAlO3 were present in the sample produced at 1100 °C–12 h along with the main phase of cubic LLZO structure. According to SEM images, the sintering temperature was found to be more effective than sintering time on the densification behaviour. Existing porosities were reduced when both sintering temperature and time were increased. Different amount of Al addition did not have an effect on the densification behaviour. Both intergranular and transgranular types of fractures were observed by SEM. Finally it was found that 30 mol % Al containing samples sintered at 1150 °C for 12 h showed mixed conductor behaviour, whereas for 24 h and 36 h pellets showed ionic conductor behaviour.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.135901
Structural and Electrochemical Consequences of Al and Ga Cosubstitution in Li7La3Zr2O12 Solid Electrolytes,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Several ""Beyond Li-Ion Battery"" concepts such as all solid-state batteries and hybrid liquid/solid systems envision the use of a solid electrolyte to protect Li-metal anodes. These configurations are very attractive due to the possibility of exceptionally high energy densities and high (dis)charge rates, but they are far from being realized practically due to a number of issues including high interfacial resistance and difficulties associated with fabrication. One of the most promising solid electrolyte systems for these applications is Al or Ga stabilized Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) based on high ionic conductivities and apparent stability against reduction by Li metal. Nevertheless, the fabrication of dense LLZO membranes with high ionic conductivity and low interfacial resistances remains challenging; it definitely requires a better understanding of the structural and electrochemical properties. In this study, the phase transition from garnet (Ia3Ì...d, No. 230) to ""non-garnet"" (I4Ì...3d, No. 220) space group as a function of composition and the different sintering behavior of Ga and Al stabilized LLZO are identified as important factors in determining the electrochemical properties. The phase transition was located at an Al:Ga substitution ratio of 0.05:0.15 and is accompanied by a significant lowering of the activation energy for Li-ion transport to 0.26 eV. The phase transition combined with microstructural changes concomitant with an increase of the Ga/Al ratio continuously improves the Li-ion conductivity from 2.6 × 10-4 S cm-1 to 1.2 × 10-3 S cm-1, which is close to the calculated maximum for garnet-type materials. The increase in Ga content is also associated with better densification and smaller grains and is accompanied by a change in the area specific resistance (ASR) from 78 to 24 Ω cm2, the lowest reported value for LLZO so far. These results illustrate that understanding the structure-properties relationships in this class of materials allows practical obstacles to its utilization to be readily overcome.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00038

LLZO pellets were sintered at different temperatures from 1150 to 1200 °C in air atmosphere. When the temperature was above 1150 °C, tetragonal LLZO would completely transform into cubic phase. The total ionic conductivity of LLZO pellet sintered at 1180 °C was 2.0 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 30 °C, and the activation energy was 0.25 eV. This result indicates that high quality LLZO solid electrolytes can be obtained by chemical co-precipitation method.",Solid State Ionics,10.1021/acsami.5b12186
Field assisted sintering of fine-grained Li7-3xLa3Zr2AlxO12 solid electrolyte and the influence of the microstructure on the electrochemical performance,"© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.The synthesis and processing of fine-grained Li7-3xLa3Zr2AlxO12 (x = 0.15, 0.17, 0.20) solid electrolyte (LLZO) is performed for the first time using a combination of nebulized spray pyrolysis (NSP) and field assisted sintering technique (FAST). Using FAST, the grain growth is suppressed and highly dense ceramics with 93% of the theoretical density are obtained. A tetragonal lattice distortion is observed after the sintering process. Although this structural modification has been reported to have lower Li-ion mobility compared to the cubic modification, the total conductivity of the sample at room temperature is found to be 0.33 mS cm-1, i.e. comparable to phase-pure cubic LLZO. The activation energy of 0.38 eV is also comparable to the literature values. Galvanostatic cycling of a symmetrical cell Li|LLZO|Li shows a good cycling stability over 100 h. The interfacial resistance in contact with Li-metal is determined using alternating current impedance spectroscopy to be 76 Ω cm2 and 69 Ω cm2 before and after cycling at different current densities, respectively.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b02708
Sparse Cyclic Excitations Explain the Low Ionic Conductivity of Stoichiometric Li7La3Zr2 O12,"© 2016 American Physical Society.We have performed long time scale molecular dynamics simulations of the cubic and tetragonal phases of the solid lithium-ion electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), using a first-principles parametrized interatomic potential. Collective lithium transport was analyzed by identifying dynamical excitations: persistent ion displacements over distances comparable to the separation between lithium sites, and stringlike clusters of ions that undergo cooperative motion. We find that dynamical excitations in c-LLZO (cubic) are frequent, with participating lithium numbers following an exponential distribution, mirroring the dynamics of fragile glasses. In contrast, excitations in t-LLZO (tetragonal) are both temporally and spatially sparse, consisting preferentially of highly concerted lithium motion around closed loops. This qualitative difference is explained as a consequence of lithium ordering in t-LLZO and provides a mechanistic basis for the much lower ionic conductivity of t-LLZO compared to c-LLZO.",Physical Review Letters,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.10.084
Crystal Structure of Garnet-Related Li-Ion Conductor Li7-3xGaxLa3Zr2O12: Fast Li-Ion Conduction Caused by a Different Cubic Modification?,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Li-oxide garnets such as Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) are among the most promising candidates for solid-state electrolytes to be used in next-generation Li-ion batteries. The garnet-structured cubic modification of LLZO, showing space group Ia-3d, has to be stabilized with supervalent cations. LLZO stabilized with Ga3+ shows superior properties compared to LLZO stabilized with similar cations; however, the reason for this behavior is still unknown. In this study, a comprehensive structural characterization of Ga-stabilized LLZO is performed by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Coarse-grained samples with crystal sizes of several hundred micrometers are obtained by solid-state reaction. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction results show that Li7-3xGaxLa3Zr2O12 with x > 0.07 crystallizes in the acentric cubic space group I-43d. This is the first definite record of this cubic modification for LLZO materials and might explain the superior electrochemical performance of Ga-stabilized LLZO compared to its Al-stabilized counterpart. The phase transition seems to be caused by the site preference of Ga3+. 7Li NMR spectroscopy indicates an additional Li-ion diffusion process for LLZO with space group I-43d compared to space group Ia-3d. Despite all efforts undertaken to reveal structure-property relationships for this class of materials, this study highlights the potential for new discoveries.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.10.053
Ionic Conductivity and Air Stability of Al-Doped Li7La3Zr2O12 Sintered in Alumina and Pt Crucibles,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a promising electrolyte material for all-solid-state battery due to its high ionic conductivity and good stability with metallic lithium. In this article, we studied the effect of crucibles on the ionic conductivity and air stability by synthesizing 0.25Al doped LLZO pellets in Pt crucibles and alumina crucibles, respectively. The results show that the composition and microstructure of the pellets play important roles influencing the ionic conductivity, relative density, and air stability. Specifically, the 0.25Al-LLZO pellets sintered in Pt crucibles exhibit a high relative density (∼96%) and high ionic conductivity (4.48 × 10-4 S cm-1). The ionic conductivity maintains 3.6 × 10-4 S cm-1 after 3-month air exposure. In contrast, the ionic conductivity of the pellets from alumina crucibles is about 1.81 × 10-4 S cm-1 and drops to 2.39 × 10-5 S cm-1 3 months later. The large grains and the reduced grain boundaries in the pellets sintered in Pt crucibles are favorable to obtain high ionic conductivity and good air stability. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy results suggest that the formation of Li2CO3 on the pellet surface is probably another main reason, which is also closely related to the relative density and the amount of grain boundary within the pellets. This work stresses the importance of synthesis parameters, crucibles included, to obtain the LLZO electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and good air stability.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b03854
Influence of Li+ and H+ Distribution on the Crystal Structure of Li7-xHxLa3Zr2O12 (0 = ≤ x ≤ = 5) Garnets,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.With appropriate doping or processing, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is an excellent candidate to be used in Li batteries either as a solid electrolyte or as a separator between the Li anode and a liquid electrolyte. For both uses, the reactivity with water either from the air or in aqueous media is a matter of interest. We address here the structural changes undergone by LLZO as a result of H+/Li+ exchange and relate them with the amount of H content and atomic distribution. Neutron diffraction is performed to elucidate Li and H location. Two different cubic phases derive from LLZO through H+/Li+ exchange: Deep hydration up to 150°C yields a noncentrosymmetric I43d phase in which octahedral Li ions are exchanged by H ions, tetrahedral Li ions split into two sites with very different occupancies, and H ions form O4H4 entities around the less occupied tetrahedral site. Annealing above 300°C results in a centrosymmetric Ia3d phase with lower H content in which Li ions occupy the usual sites of the cubic garnets and H ions occupy a split pseudooctahedral site. The centrosymmetric or noncentrosymmetric character is determined by the temperature at which exchange is performed and the H content. Both factors are not independent: at low temperature, the high H content favors H ordering around the vacant tetrahedra, while low H content and higher mobility at 350°C lead to a disordered configuration of Li and H ions. The deeply hydrated garnets are stable up to at least 300°C and also upon aging at room temperature.",Inorganic Chemistry,10.3389/fenrg.2016.00014
Multistep sintering to synthesize fast lithium garnets,"© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.A multistep sintering schedule is developed to synthesize Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) doped with 0.2 mol% Al3+. The effect of sintering steps on phase, relative density and ionic conductivity of Al-doped LLZO has been evaluated using powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 27Al magic spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that by holding the sample at 900 °C for 6 h, the mixture of tetragonal and cubic garnet phases are obtained; by continuously holding at 1100 °C for 6 h, the tetragonal phase completely transforms into cubic phase; by holding at 1200 °C, the relative density increases without decomposition of the cubic phase. The Al-LLZO pellets after multistep sintering exhibit cubic phase, relative density of 94.25% and ionic conductivity of 4.5 × 10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature. Based on the observation, a sintering model is proposed and discussed.",Journal of Power Sources,10.3389/fenrg.2016.00020
Characterizing the Li-Li7La3Zr2O12 interface stability and kinetics as a function of temperature and current density,"© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.The stability and kinetics of the Li-Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) interface were characterized as a function of temperature and current density. Polycrystalline LLZO was densified using a rapid hot-pressing technique achieving 97 ± 1% relative density, and <10% grain boundary resistance; effectively consisting of an ensemble of single LLZO crystals. It was determined that by heating to 175 °C, the room temperature Li-LLZO interface resistance decreases dramatically from 5822 (as-assembled) to 514 ω cm2; a > 10-fold decrease. In characterizing the maximum sustainable current density (or critical current density - CCD) of the Li-LLZO interface, several signs of degradation were observed. In DC cycling tests, significant deviation from Ohmic behavior was observed. In post-cycling tests, regions of metallic Li were observed; propagating parallel to the ionic current. For the cells cycled at 30, 70, 100, 130 and 160 °C, the CCD was determined to be 50, 200, 800, 3500, and 20000 μA cm-2, respectively. The relationships and phenomena observed in this work can be used to better understand the Li-LLZO interface stability, enabling the use of batteries employing Li metal anodes.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1039/c6ta04492a
Elastic Properties of the Solid Electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO),"© 2015 American Chemical Society.The oxide known as LLZO, with nominal composition Li7La3Zr2O12, is a promising solid electrolyte for Li-based batteries due to its high Li-ion conductivity and chemical stability with respect to lithium. Solid electrolytes may also enable the use of metallic Li anodes by serving as a physical barrier that suppresses dendrite initiation and propagation during cycling. Prior linear elasticity models of the Li electrode/solid electrolyte interface suggest that the stability of this interface is highly dependent on the elastic properties of the solid separator. For example, dendritic suppression is predicted to be enhanced as the electrolyte's shear modulus increases. In the present study a combination of first-principles calculations, acoustic impulse excitation measurements, and nanoindentation experiments are used to determine the elastic constants and moduli for high-conductivity LLZO compositions based on Al and Ta doping. The calculated and measured isotropic shear moduli are in good agreement and fall within the range of 56-61 GPa. These values are an order of magnitude larger than that for Li metal and far exceed the minimum value (∼8.5 GPa) believed to be necessary to suppress dendrite initiation. These data suggest that LLZO exhibits sufficient stiffness to warrant additional development as a solid electrolyte for Li batteries.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1149/07207.0133ecst
Intermittent contact alternating current scanning electrochemical microscopy: A method for mapping conductivities in solid Li ion conducting electrolyte samples,"© 2016 Catarelli, Lonsdale, Cheng, Syzdek and Doeff. Intermittent contact alternating current scanning electrochemical microscopy (ic-ac-SECM) has been used to determine the electrochemical response to an ac signal of several types of materials. A conductive gold foil and insulating Teflon sheet were first used to demonstrate that the intermittent contact function allows the topography and conductivity to be mapped simultaneously and independently in a single experiment. Then, a dense pellet of an electronically insulating but Li ion conducting garnet phase, Al-substituted Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO), was characterized using the same technique. The polycrystalline pellet was prepared by classical ceramic sintering techniques and was comprised of large (~150 μm) grains. Critical information regarding the contributions of grain and grain boundary resistances to the total conductivity of the garnet phase was lacking due to ambiguities in the impedance data. In contrast, the use of the ic-ac-SECM technique allowed spatially resolved information regarding local conductivities to be measured directly. Impedance mapping of the pellet showed that the grain boundary resistance, while generally higher than that of grains, varied considerably, revealing the complex nature of the LLZO sample.",Frontiers in Energy Research,10.1039/c6ta07268b
Electrochemical stability of Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 M 0.5 O 12 (M = Nb or Ta) against metallic lithium,"© 2016 Kim, Yoo, Schmidt, Sharafi, Lee, Wolfenstine and Sakamoto. The electrochemical stability of Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 Nb 0.5 O 12 (LLZNO) and Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 Ta 0.5 O 12 (LLZTO) against metallic Li was studied using direct current (DC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Dense polycrystalline LLZNO (ρ = 97%) and LLZTO (ρ = 92%) were made using sol-gel synthesis and rapid induction hot-pressing at 1100°C and 15.8 MPa. During DC cycling tests at room temperature (± 0.01 mA/cm 2 for 36 cycles), LLZNO exhibited an increase in Li-LLZNO interface resistance and eventually short-circuiting while the LLZTO was stable. After DC cycling, LLZNO appeared severely discolored while the LLZTO did not change in appearance. We believe the increase in Li-LLZNO interfacial resistance and discoloration are due to reduction of Nb 5+ to Nb 4+ . The negligible change in interfacial resistance and no color change in LLZTO suggest that Ta 5+ may be more stable against reduction than Nb 5+ in cubic garnet versus Li during cycling.",Frontiers in Energy Research,10.1166/jnn.2016.13570
"Flame made nanoparticles permit processing of dense, flexible, Li+ conducting ceramic electrolyte thin films of cubic-Li7La3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO)","© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Ceramic electrolytes are proposed as key components in resolving challenges extant in developing next generation, high energy density Li batteries by replacing liquid electrolytes to improve safety and performance. Among numerous candidates, c-LLZO offers multiple desirable properties: High ionic conductivities (0.1-1 mS cm-1), Li stability, a wide electrochemical operating window (∼6 V) and pH stability (7-11.5). However, incorporation into prototype cells has yet to be demonstrated as c-LLZO membranes at thicknesses <50 μm have not been achieved. Processing dense, thin films matching bulk counterpart properties remains a very difficult target arising from energy and/or equipment intensive sintering, Li volatilization, and contamination from substrates. We show that using metalloorganic derived flame made nanoparticles can overcome these processing challenges resulting in a significantly reduced energy input required for densification, 10-40 fold shorter dwell times at sintering temperatures, compared to common solid state reaction derived c-LLZO. Furthermore, surface/volume ratios of the films are determined to be a critical factor affecting final microstructures and phase compositions of the sintered films. Through careful control of the processing variables, 10-15 grains thick, dense (94 ± 1%) c-LLZO thin (<30 μm), flexible films with high ambient ionic conductivities (0.2 ± 0.03 mS cm-1) are achieved using conventional casting-sintering of flame made nanoparticles. These c-LLZO membranes greatly increase the selection of complementary cell components and simplify battery configurations broadening opportunities for cell designs.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1149/07301.0179ecst

An aluminum content of 0.67 mole fraction led to the formation of LaAlO3 even at 1100°C, indicating that the solubility limit of aluminum in the cubic LLZO structure had been exceeded.",ECS Transactions,10.1039/c6ra09695f
Hybrid solid electrolyte with the combination of Li7La3Zr2O12 ceramic and ionic liquid for high voltage pseudo-solid-state Li-ion batteries,"© 2016 Royal Society of Chemistry.Concerning the safety aspects of high-voltage Li-ion batteries, a pelletized hybrid solid electrolyte (HSE) was prepared by blending Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramic particles and an ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) for use in pseudo-solid-state Li-ion batteries. The LLZO particles are enclosed by the ionic liquid as a LLZO-ILE matrix, and are quantified by FESEM elemental mapping. The chemical stability of the LLZO in the ILE is confirmed by powder XRD and FT-IR analysis. The HSE, with an optimized weight ratio of 80% LLZO, 19% Py14TFSI, and 1% lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, exhibits good thermal stability, even at 400 °C. The optimized HSE reveals an ionic conductivity of 0.4 × 10-3 S cm-1 and an electrochemical stability of 5.5 V with Li metal. Pseudo-solid-state Li-ion cells are fabricated using the HSE, and afford initial charge-discharge capacities of 140/130 mA h g-1 (Li/HSE/LiCoO2) with 99% capacity retention at the 150th cycle. The scope of the HSE is widened to high-voltage (>8 V) pseudo-solid-state Li-ion batteries through a bipolar stacked cell design. Dendrite formation is hindered during cycling in the Li-ion cell. Hence, the present investigation will greatly contribute to the next generation of high-voltage pseudo-solid-state Li-ion batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1038/srep18053
A comparative study on the synthesis of Al-doped Li6.2La3Zr2O12 powder as a solid electrolyte using sol-gel synthesis and solid-state processing,"Copyright © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.In this study, we fabricated and characterized two kinds of Al-doped Li6.2La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) powders with the modified sol-gel synthesis and solid-state processing, respectively. Moreover, the two kinds of LLZO powders were compared in detail examining the powder size and processing window for the cubic phase. In the case of the sol-gel synthesis, the processed powder exhibited a pure cubic phase with little secondary phases such as Li-deficient pyrochlore or LaAlO3 at calcination temperatures above 900°C and a mixed phase of cubic and tetragonal structure at 800°C. However, in the solid-state processed powder, the tetragonal phase was converted to a cubic one at a temperature of 1000°C. When the amount of Li addition was varied, sol-gel synthesized LLZO powder also had a much wider range for cubic phases than that of the solid-state processed one. The sol-gel LLZO powder with a Li addition of 7.13 mol. showed an average grain size of 429 nm and a specific BET surface area of 5.34 m2/g. The formation of the cubic phase with few secondary ones was sensitive to Al doping amount. The results of this study suggest that the sol-gel process is the more optimum method for obtaining the cubic phase of LLZO powder for highly dense and conductive solid electrolyte ceramics.",Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology,10.1039/c5ja00250h

A novel low-temperature solid-state route for nanostructured cubic garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 and its application to Li-ion battery,"© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.We present a novel approach to the solid-state synthesis of garnet-type cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO) nanostructured particles with 1.0 mass% Al at 750 °C within 3 h. In contrast to conventional solid-state processes, a highly reactive precursor was prepared in two steps: (i) by homogenizing the stoichiometric mixture without Li, and (ii) subsequent addition of Li in the form of an ethanolic solution of lithium acetate. The actual composition determined by ICP analysis was Li6.61La3Zr2Al0.13O11.98. Sintering these nanoparticles at 1100 °C for 3 h in air after cold isostatic pressing brought a dense ceramic pellet with a relative density of 90.5%. The corresponding ionic conductivity with Au electrodes was 1.6 × 10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature. To study its electrochemical behavior as an electrolyte, a model cell of Li//(1 M LiPF6 + c-LLZO)//LiCoO2 configuration was constructed. Cyclic voltammetry of the cell delivered one set of redox couple with narrow voltage separation (15 mV) with a Li+ diffusion coefficient at room temperature of about 2 × 10-11 cm2 s-1 at the interface between LiCoO2 and 1 M LiPF6 + c-LLZO. The cell received an average discharge capacity of 64.4, 60.3, 56.1, 51.9 and 46.9 μA h cm-2 μm-1 at discharge rates 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 4C and 6C, respectively. The cell exhibited complete oxidation and reduction reactions with an average initial discharge capacity of about 64 μA h cm-2 μm-1, which is 92.7% of LiCoO2 theoretical value. These observations indicate the applicability of the present c-LLZO as an electrolyte for a solid-state Li-ion battery.",RSC Advances,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b01895
Synergistic multi-doping effects on the Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte for fast lithium ion conduction,"Here, we investigate the doping effects on the lithium ion transport behavior in garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) from the combined experimental and theoretical approach. The concentration of Li ion vacancy generated by the inclusion of aliovalent dopants such as Al3+ plays a key role in stabilizing the cubic LLZO. However, it is found that the site preference of Al in 24d position hinders the three dimensionally connected Li ion movement when heavily doped according to the structural refinement and the DFT calculations. In this report, we demonstrate that the multi-doping using additional Ta dopants into the Al-doped LLZO shifts the most energetically favorable sites of Al in the crystal structure from 24d to 96 h Li site, thereby providing more open space for Li ion transport. As a result of these synergistic effects, the multi-doped LLZO shows about three times higher ionic conductivity of 6.14 × 10-4 S cm-1 than that of the singly-doped LLZO with a much less efforts in stabilizing cubic phases in the synthetic condition.",Scientific Reports,10.1007/s11581-015-1556-2
Three-dimensional elemental imaging of Li-ion solid-state electrolytes using fs-laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS),"© 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Direct chemical imaging is critical to understand and control processes that affect the performance and safety of Li-ion batteries.

"Synthesis, Crystal Chemistry, and Electrochemical Properties of Li7-2xLa3Zr2-xMoxO12 (x = 0.1-0.4): Stabilization of the Cubic Garnet Polymorph via Substitution of Zr4+ by Mo6+","© 2015 American Chemical Society.Cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnets are exceptionally well suited to be used as solid electrolytes or protecting layers in ""Beyond Li-ion Battery"" concepts. Unfortunately, cubic LLZO is not stable at room temperature (RT) and has to be stabilized by supervalent dopants. In this study we demonstrate a new possibility to stabilize the cubic phase at RT via substitution of Zr4+ by Mo6+. A Mo6+ content of 0.25 per formula unit (pfu) stabilizes the cubic LLZO phase, and the solubility limit is about 0.3 Mo6+ pfu. Based on the results of neutron powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, Mo6+ is located at the octahedrally coordinated 16a site of the cubic garnet structure (space group Ia-3d). Since Mo6+ has a smaller ionic radius compared to Zr4+ the lattice parameter a0 decreases almost linearly as a function of the Mo6+ content. The highest bulk Li-ion conductivity is found for the 0.25 pfu composition, with a typical RT value of 3.4 × 10-4 S cm-1. An additional significant resistive contribution originating from the sample interior (most probably from grain boundaries) could be identified in impedance spectra. The latter strongly depends on the prehistory and increases significantly after annealing at 700°C in ambient air. Cyclic voltammetry experiments on cells containing Mo6+ substituted LLZO indicate that the material is stable up to 6 V.",Inorganic Chemistry,10.15541/jim20150163
Synthesis and characterization of substituted garnet and perovskite-based lithium-ion conducting solid electrolytes,"© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA) 2015.Titanium, tantalum-substituted Li7La3Zr2-xAxO12 (LLZO, A=Ta, Ti) garnets, and chromium-substituted La(2/3)-xLi3xTi1-yCryO3 (LLTO) perovskites were prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction and the Pechini processes. The desired crystal phases were obtained by varying the calcination temperature and time, as well as the substitution concentration. All samples indicated decomposition of the precursors when heated above 750 °C and formation of the desired phase after heat treatment at higher temperatures. Neutron diffraction data shows the formation of a predominant cubic phase in the case of Ta-LLZO, and monoclinic phase with minor impurity phases for Cr-LLTO.

Ion Dynamics in Solid Electrolytes: NMR Reveals the Elementary Steps of Li+ Hopping in the Garnet Li6.5La3Zr1.75Mo0.25O12,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.Garnet-type oxides are considered to belong to the most attractive solid Li+ electrolytes. This is due to their wide electrochemical stability window as well as their superior ionic conductivity, with a Li-ion transference number of almost one. Usually ionic conductivities are studied via impedance spectroscopy on a macroscopic length scale. Time-domain NMR methods, however, have been used much less extensively to shed light on the elementary hopping processes in highly conducting oxide garnets. Here, we used NMR relaxometry and stimulated echo NMR to study Li+ self-diffusion in Li6.5La3Zr1.75Mo0.25O12 (LLZMO), which served as a model compound to collect information on the 7Li spin dynamics. It turned out that NMR spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) recorded in both the laboratory and rotating frame of reference shows features that seem to be a universal fingerprint for fast conducting garnets that have been stabilized in their cubic modification. In contrast to Al-doped garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 that modifies the Li sublattice, in LLZMO the Li sublattice remains intact, offering the possibility to get to the bottom of Li-ion dynamics in LLZO-based garnets. Most importantly, whereas NMR SLR rates measured at 194.3 MHz reflect an almost universal behavior of local hoppings being thermally activated by only 0.151(3) eV, the spin-lock technique (33.3¯ kHz) gives evidence of two separate, overlapping rate peaks with activation energies on the order of 0.29 eV for the elementary steps of Li-ion hopping. This points to a less pronounced distribution of Li+ jump rates on the kilohertz time scale than has been observed for the Al-stabilized LLZO samples. The NMR results obtained also entail information on both the Li+ diffusion coefficients and the shape of the underlying motional correlation functions. The latter has been provided by 7Li NMR spin-alignment echo correlation spectroscopy that also shows the involvement of 24d and 96h sites in Li+ diffusion.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b03589
High ion conductivity in garnet-type F-doped Li7La3Zr2O12,"©, 2015, Science Press. All right reserved.A novel garnet-type solid electrolyte, F-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), was prepared via conventional solid-state reaction. Certain fluoride compounds were known to form the pure cubic garnet structure after continuous calcination at 900℃ and 1125℃, seperately. Fluorine ions doped in LLZO contributed to the stabilization of high ion conductivity garnet phase as well as the enhancement of sintering activity. The effects of fluorine ions were studied using the dopants LiF and CaF2. The 1.0wt% LiF-LLZO samples exhibited a total conductivity of 5×10-4 S/cm close to the bulk conductivity value of un-doped LLZO, while its activation energy was 0.26 eV, lower than that of other cation-doped LLZO samples. The strong intensity of the peaks indexed to (321), (400), (642), and (800) in XRD patterns indicated the growth of ceramic grains of F-doped LLZO in certain favorable crystallographic orientations during sintering process. In addition, a unique microstructure was revealed in the novel garnet-type oxide pellets, showing the grain boundary almost removed and closed pores formed, which resulted in the negligible grain boundary and the high total ion conductivity.",Wuji Cailiao Xuebao/Journal of Inorganic Materials,10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b01023

"Interrelationships among Grain Size, Surface Composition, Air Stability, and Interfacial Resistance of Al-Substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 Solid Electrolytes","© 2015 American Chemical Society.The interfacial resistances of symmetrical lithium cells containing Al-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid electrolytes are sensitive to their microstructures and histories of exposure to air. Air exposure of LLZO samples with large grain sizes (∼150 μm) results in dramatically increased interfacial impedances in cells containing them, compared to those with pristine large-grained samples. In contrast, a much smaller difference is seen between cells with small-grained (∼20 μm) pristine and air-exposed LLZO samples. A combination of soft X-ray absorption (sXAS) and Raman spectroscopy, with probing depths ranging from nanometer to micrometer scales, revealed that the small-grained LLZO pellets are more air-stable than large-grained ones, forming far less surface Li2CO3 under both short- and long-term exposure conditions. Surface sensitive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicates that the better chemical stability of the small-grained LLZO is related to differences in the distribution of Al and Li at sample surfaces. Density functional theory calculations show that LLZO can react via two different pathways to form Li2CO3. The first, more rapid, pathway involves a reaction with moisture in air to form LiOH, which subsequently absorbs CO2 to form Li2CO3. The second, slower, pathway involves direct reaction with CO2 and is favored when surface lithium contents are lower, as with the small-grained samples. These observations have important implications for the operation of solid-state lithium batteries containing LLZO because the results suggest that the interfacial impedances of these devices is critically dependent upon specific characteristics of the solid electrolyte and how it is prepared.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1016/j.tsf.2014.11.019
Nanostructured Garnet-Type Solid Electrolytes for Lithium Batteries: Electrospinning Synthesis of Li7La3Zr2O12 Nanowires and Particle Size-Dependent Phase Transformation,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.Lithium lanthanum zirconate (LLZO) is a promising ceramic solid electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium batteries with improved safety characteristics. However, the different phases of LLZO differ in lithium ionic conductivity by several orders of magnitude, with extrinsic dopants often required to stabilize the high conductivity cubic phase. Here we show that cubic LLZO can be stabilized at room temperature in nanostructured particles without the use of extrinsic dopants. LLZO nanowires were synthesized using electrospinning and formed cubic phase materials after only 3 h calcination at 700°C. Bulk LLZO with tetragonal structure was transformed to the cubic phase using particle size reduction via ball milling. Heating conditions that promoted particle coalescence and grain growth induced a transformation from the cubic to tetragonal phases in both types of nanostructured LLZO. Detailed structural characterizations with XRD and TEM were performed to understand the LLZO formation processes and phase transformations. This work demonstrates another strategy, namely the use of nanostructuring, as an alternative to extrinsic doping for obtaining cubic phase LLZO.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.078
First-Principles Studies on Cation Dopants and Electrolyte|Cathode Interphases for Lithium Garnets,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.Lithium garnet with the formula Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has many properties of an ideal electrolyte in all-solid state lithium batteries. However, internal resistance in batteries utilizing these electrolytes remains high. For widespread adoption, the LLZO's internal resistance must be lowered by increasing its bulk conductivity, reducing grain boundary resistance, and/or pairing it with an appropriate cathode to minimize interfacial resistance. Cation doping has been shown to be crucial in LLZO to stabilize the higher conductivity cubic structure, yet there is still little understanding about which cations have high solubility in LLZO. In this work, we apply density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the defect energies and site preference of all possible dopants in these materials. Our findings suggest several novel dopants such as Zn2+ and Mg2+ predicted to be stable on the Li- and Zr-sites, respectively. To understand the source of interfacial resistance between the electrolyte and the cathode, we investigate the thermodynamic stability of the electrolyte|cathode interphase, calculating the reaction energy for LLMO (M = Zr, Ta) against LiCoO2, LiMnO2, and LiFePO4 (LCO, LMO, and LFP, respectively) cathodes over the voltage range seen in lithium-ion battery operation. Our results suggest that, for LLZO, the LLZO|LCO is the most stable, showing only a low driving force for decomposition in the charged state into La2O3, La2Zr2O7, and Li2CoO3, while the LLZO|LFP appears to be the most reactive, forming Li3PO4, La2Zr2O7, LaFeO3, and Fe2O3. These results provide a reference for use by researchers interested in bonding these electrolytes to cathodes.",Chemistry of Materials,10.1021/am508111r

Effects of crystallinity and impurities on the electrical conductivity of Li-La-Zr-O thin films,"© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.We present a study of the fabrication of thin films from a Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) target using pulsed laser deposition. The effects of substrate temperatures and impurities on electrochemical properties of the films were investigated. The thin films of Li-La-Zr-O were deposited at room temperature and higher temperatures on a variety of substrates. Deposition above 600°C resulted in a mixture of cubic and tetragonal phases of LLZO, as well as a La2Zr2O7 impurity, and resulted in aluminum enrichment at the surface when Al-containing substrates were used. Films deposited at 600°C exhibited the highest room temperature conductivity, 1.61 × 10- 6 S/cm. The chemical stability toward metallic lithium was also studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which showed that the oxidation state of zirconium remained at + 4 following physical contact with heated lithium metal.",Thin Solid Films,10.1039/c4ta03772c
Enhancement of ionic conductivity of composite membranes for all-solid-state lithium rechargeable batteries incorporating tetragonal Li7La3Zr2O12 into a polyethylene oxide matrix,"© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.The lithium ion conductivities of as-prepared composite membranes consisting of a polyethylene oxide (PEO) matrix with various contents of tetragonal Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) were evaluated, and the optimum composition (52.5% LLZO) was determined by performing AC impedance measurements. The ionic conductivities of the composite membranes pass through a maximum as the LLZO content varies. Therefore, the hybridization of the organic and inorganic components of these membranes results in synergetic effects on their lithium ionic conductivity. In addition, tests of Li/composite membrane/LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 half-cells found that their charge/discharge properties are better than those of a PEO-only membrane and a membrane containing 52.5% Al2O3 instead of LLZO.",Journal of Power Sources,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.05.007

Effect of surface microstructure on electrochemical performance of garnet solid electrolytes,"© This article not subject to U.S. Copyright. Published 2015 by the American Chemical Society.Cubic garnet phases based on Al-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) have high ionic conductivities and exhibit good stability versus metallic lithium, making them of particular interest for use in next-generation rechargeable battery systems. However, high interfacial impedances have precluded their successful utilization in such devices until the present. Careful engineering of the surface microstructure, especially the grain boundaries, is critical to achieving low interfacial resistances and enabling long-term stable cycling with lithium metal. This study presents the fabrication of LLZO heterostructured solid electrolytes, which allowed direct correlation of surface microstructure with the electrochemical characteristics of the interface. Grain orientations and grain boundary distributions of samples with differing microstructures were mapped using high-resolution synchrotron polychromatic X-ray Laue microdiffraction. The electrochemical characteristics are strongly dependent upon surface microstructure, with small grained samples exhibiting much lower interfacial resistances and better cycling behavior than those with larger grain sizes. Low area specific resistances of 37 ω cm2 were achieved; low enough to ensure stable cycling with minimal polarization losses, thus removing a significant obstacle toward practical implementation of solid electrolytes in high energy density batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1039/c4cp02921f
Field assisted sintering of dense Al-substituted cubic phase Li 7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolytes,"High performance lithium ion conducting Li7La3Zr 2O12 solid electrolytes are prepared for the first time by field assisted sintering technology (FAST). The effect of sintering temperature on the phase compositions, microstructure and Li ionic conductivity is systematically investigated. The results show that pure cubic phase LLZO can be obtained at a range of temperatures from 1100 to 1180 °C for no more than 10 min. For the sample sintered at 1150 °C, a maximum relative density of 99.8% with a total ionic conductivity as high as 5.7 × 10-4 S cm-1 are obtained at room temperature. This value is the highest among the present research. Compared with the traditional preparation methods, the current FAST is very promising to obtain high performance LLZO for its advantages of very short sintering time, a single preparation step of reaction-densification processing, and relatively lower sintering temperature. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of the morphology of Li-La-Zr-O solid electrolyte coating on the electrochemical performance of spinel LiMn1.95Ni0.05O3.98F0.02 cathode materials,"© 2014 the Partner Organisations.Lithium ion solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) coated LiMn1.95Ni0.05O3.98F0.02 cathode materials with controllable coating morphology were prepared via a sol-gel route and subsequently heat treated at different temperatures. The effect of the morphology of Li-La-Zr-O solid electrolyte coating on the electrochemical performance of spinel LiMn1.95Ni0.05O3.98F0.02 cathode materials was investigated by XRD, SEM, TEM and electrochemical tests. The results showed the coating did not change the spinel structure of LiMn1.95Ni0.05O3.98F0.02 cathode materials, as the atoms of coating material can only adhere to the surface of the octahedral grain rather than enter the spinel lattice. Heat annealing temperature has a significant effect on the microstructure of the LLZO coating layer. At a lower heat annealing temperature (400 °C), the coating forms a reticulation, whereas at the mid-temperature (600 °C), it exhibits a more uniform and continuous layer; moreover, when the heat treatment temperature increases to a high level (800 °C), the coating exists as discontinuous nanoparticles rather than as a layer. Among all coating forms, the continuous coating layer formed at 600 °C shows the best electrochemical performance.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1016/j.cossms.2013.10.002
Nebulized spray pyrolysis of Al-doped Li7La3Zr 2O12 solid electrolyte for battery applications,"Nebulized spray pyrolysis followed by consolidation and sintering was used for the first time to prepare Al-doped garnet-based Li7-3xLa 3Zr2AlxO12 (x = 0-0.25) (LLZO) ultra-fine grained ceramics.

Tetragonal vs. cubic phase stability in Al-free Ta doped Li 7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO),"Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet is attracting interest as a promising Li-ion solid electrolyte. LLZO exists in a tetragonal and cubic polymorph where the cubic phase exhibits ∼2 orders of magnitude higher Li-ion conduction. It has been suggested that a critical Li vacancy concentration (0.4-0.5 atoms per formula unit) is required to stabilize the cubic polymorph of Li7La3Zr2O12. This has been confirmed experimentally for Al3+ doping on the Li+ site. Substitution of M5+ (M = Ta, Nb) for Zr 4+ is an alternative means to create Li vacancies and should have the same critical Li vacancy concentration, nevertheless, subcritically doped compositions (0.25 moles of Li vacancies per formula unit) have been reported as cubic. Adventitious Al, from alumina crucibles, was likely present in these studies that could have acted as a second dopant to introduce vacancies. In this work, Al-free subcritically doped (Li6.75La3Zr 1.75Ta0.25O12) and critically doped (Li 6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12) compositions are investigated. X-ray diffraction indicates that both compositions are cubic. However, upon further materials characterization, including SEM analysis, Raman spectroscopy, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, and neutron diffraction it is evident that the subcritically doped composition is a mixture of cubic and tetragonal phases. The results of this study confirm that 0.4-0.5 Li vacancies per formula unit are required to stabilize the cubic polymorph of LLZO.

The origin of high electrolyte-electrode interfacial resistances in lithium cells containing garnet type solid electrolytes,"Dense LLZO (Al-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12) pellets were processed in controlled atmospheres to investigate the relationships between the surface chemistry and interfacial behavior in lithium cells. Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies revealed that Li2CO3 was formed on the surface when LLZO pellets were exposed to air. The distribution and thickness of the Li2CO3 layer were estimated by a combination of bulk and surface sensitive techniques with various probing depths. First-principles thermodynamic calculations confirmed that LLZO has an energetic preference to form Li2CO3 in air. Exposure to air and the subsequent formation of Li2CO3 at the LLZO surface is the source of the high interfacial impedances observed in cells with lithium electrodes. Surface polishing can effectively remove Li2CO3 and dramatically improve the interfacial properties. Polished samples in lithium cells had an area specific resistance (ASR) of only 109 Ω cm2 for the LLZO/Li interface, the lowest reported value for Al-substituted LLZO. Galvanostatic cycling results obtained from lithium symmetrical cells also suggest that the quality of the LLZO/lithium interface has a significant impact on the device lifetime. © the Partner Organisations 2014.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.155

Recent developments in garnet based solid state electrolytes for thin film batteries,"This paper reviews the current status of, and new progress in, the field of solid state electrolytes (SSE) for lithium ion batteries. In addition to a review of current technologies, we are also presenting our novel results on pulsed laser processing of garnet based SSEs, specifically Li7La 3Zr2O12 (LLZO). LLZO powders with a tetragonal structure were prepared by a sol-gel technique, then a pulsed laser annealing process was employed to covert the powders to cubic LLZO without any loss of lithium. The tetragonal LLZO exhibited a Li ion conductivity of 1.8 × 10-7 S/cm, whereas the laser annealed cubic LLZO showed a Li ion conductivity of 1.0×10-4 S/cm at room temperature.

"Effect of Rb and Ta doping on the ionic conductivity and stability of the garnet Li7+2x-y(La3-xRbx)(Zr 2-yTay)O12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.375, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1) Superionic conductor: A first principles investigation","In this work, we investigated the effect of Rb and Ta doping on the ionic conductivity and stability of the garnet Li7+2x-y(La 3-xRbx)(Zr2-yTay)O12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.375, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1) superionic conductor using first principles calculations. Our results indicate that doping does not greatly alter the topology of the migration pathway, but instead acts primarily to change the lithium concentration. The structure with the lowest activation energy and highest room temperature conductivity is Li6.75La3Zr 1.75Ta0.25O12 (Ea = 19 meV, σ300K = 1 × 10-2 S cm-1). All Ta-doped structures have significantly higher ionic conductivity than the undoped cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO, Ea = 24 meV, σ300K = 2 × 10-3 S cm-1). The Rb-doped structure with composition Li 7.25La2.875Rb0.125Zr2O12 has a lower activation energy than c-LLZO, but further Rb doping leads to a dramatic decrease in performance. We also examined the effect of changing the lattice parameter at fixed lithium concentration and found that a decrease in the lattice parameter leads to a rapid decline in Li+ conductivity, whereas an expanded lattice offers only marginal improvement. This result suggests that doping with larger cations will not provide a significant enhancement in performance.

It was found that Li 7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) was unstable in humid air. Water vapor strongly affected its stability relative to composition, mechanical integrity, ionic conductivity and cell performance. X-ray diffraction studies of the surface of a one-year-old sample showed formation of La(OH) 3 and Li(OH)·H2O impurity phases, indicating the decomposition of Li7La3Zr2O12. The mechanical strength of the pellet was low, and it easily crumbled. Facile H +/Li+ ion exchange in the electrolyte was confirmed by measuring the pH of an LLZO powder/water suspension.

In the low-temperature calcined precursor powder, Zr exists in the amorphous phase around LLTO aggregated particles. After high-temperature sintering, the LLZO phase does not exist, whereas Zr is doped into the LLTO grain interior but is richer in the grain boundary. The introduction of LLZO could modify the grain boundary region of the ceramics and thus change its electrical properties.

Concerted migration mechanism in the Li ion dynamics of garnet-type Li 7La3Zr2O12,"The garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) belonging to cubic symmetry (space group Ia3̄d) is considered as one of the most promising solid electrolyte materials for all-solid state lithium ion batteries. In this study, the diffusion coefficient and site occupancy of Li ions within the 3D network structure of the cubic LLZO framework have been investigated using ab initio molecular dynamics calculations. The bulk conductivity at 300 K is estimated to be about 1.06 × 10-4 S cm-1 with an energy barrier of 0.331 eV, in reasonable agreement with experimental results. The complex mechanism for self-diffusion of Li ions can be viewed as a concerted migration governed by two crucial features: (i) the restriction imposed for occupied site-to-site interatomic separation, and (ii) the unstable residence of Li ion at the 24d site, which can serve as the trigger for ion mobility and reconfiguration of surrounding Li neighbors to accommodate the initiated movement. Evidence for Li ordering is also found at low temperature for the LLZO system. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",Chemistry of Materials,
The effect of 24c-site (A) cation substitution on the tetragonal-cubic phase transition in Li7-xLa3-xAxZr 2O12 garnet-based ceramic electrolyte,"The garnet-type ceramic electrolyte of nominal composition Li 7La3Zr2O12 can exist in the tetragonal and cubic form. This article investigates the tetragonal to cubic phase transition based on super-valent cation substitution on the 24c site typically occupied by La (3+) in the garnet structure. Ce (4+) was selected as the super-valent cation represented as x in Li7-xLa 3-xCexZr2O12. The doping study showed that cubic LLZO was stabilized for Ce ≥ 0.2. These data agree with most literature reports suggesting that the creation of Li vacancies, while maintaining oxygen stoichiometry, is necessary to stabilize cubic LLZO. Moreover, this work suggests a critical Li vacancy concentration (0.12-0.4 mol per mole of Li7La3Zr2O12) is necessary to stabilize cubic LLZO. While the addition of Ce stabilized cubic LLZO, the total ionic conductivity (0.014 mS cm-1) was considerably lower compared to Al and Ta doped LLZO (0.4-0.9 mS cm-1, respectively). The lower conductivity is likely due to CeO2 precipitation at grain boundaries. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Journal of Power Sources,

Both, LLZO and Ta substituted LLZTO were prepared by high temperature ceramic processing and were found to crystallize in the cubic garnet-type structure (space group Ia3̄d). Phase formation was studied by X-ray powder diffraction. While Al doping was necessary for the preparation of dense LLZO ceramics crystallizing in the high lithium ion conductive cubic garnet modification, dense cubic tantalum substituted LLZTO ceramics could be prepared without Al doping. Ta substitution was found to facilitate the formation of the cubic garnet modification at lower synthesis temperature. The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity and lithium metal electrode kinetics were studied by ac impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, respectively. The ionic conductivity of cubic LLZTO was found to increase by Al doping. The highest room temperature conductivity of 5 × 10 -4 S cm -1 with an activation energy of E a = 0.41 eV was found for the sample Li 6.625La 3Zr 1.625Ta 0.375O 12 with 28 mol% Al content. Lithium electrode kinetics was studied on LLZO and LLZTO samples. The electrode activation energies of all investigated samples showed similar values between E a = 0.41 eV and 0.46 eV close to the activation energies for lithium ion migration in the bulk electrolyte. Thus, the Ta substituted and Al-doped material Li 6.625La 3Zr 1.625Ta 0.375O 12 (29 mol% Al) showed a more than one order of magnitude higher exchange current density of i 0 = 240 μA cm -2 than Ta-free LLZO with i 0 = 18 μA cm -2. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
