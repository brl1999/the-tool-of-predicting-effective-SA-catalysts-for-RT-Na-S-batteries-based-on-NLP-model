Structural screening and descriptor exploration of black phosphorus carbide supported bifunctional catalysts for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Developing optimal catalysts, to suppress the shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and serving as bifunctional catalyst with fast discharge–charge reaction kinetics, are essential for the practical applications of Li-S batteries. Herein, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, single-atom catalysts formed by embedding 3d transition metals (TMs) into the nitrogen doped defective black phosphorus carbide (TM@N4-CP) are systematically explored toward fast kinetics in Li-S batteries. Remarkably, V@N4-CP, possessing excellent metallic features, outstanding structural stability, suitable binding and easy diffusion for LiPSs, eventually stands out as the promising bifunctional electrocatalyst. Our results unveil that d-p orbital hybridization between transition metal (TM) atom and sulfur species is accompanied by weakened surrounding Li-S bonds. Consequently, the formation of TM-S bonds not only ensures inhibition of LiPSs shuttling, but also promotes the dissociation of Li2S. With the analysis of correlation map of key parameters, the ICOHP values of TM-S bonds and adsorption energy of *Li2S are identified and proposed as descriptors for fast screening towards fast reaction kinetics. Our work shows a feasible strategy for the rational design and retrieval of the decisive feature of active catalysts for Li-S batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,10.1016/j.jcis.2022.10.098
Synthesis and application of single-atom catalysts in sulfur cathode for high-performance lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022Lithium–sulfur (Li-S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising energy storage devices because of their low cost, high energy density, and environmental friendliness. However, Li-S batteries suffer from sluggish reaction kinetics and serious “shuttle effect” of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), which causes rapid decay of battery capacity and prevent their practical application. To address these problems, introducing single-atom catalysts (SACs) is an effective method to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries, due to their high catalytic efficiency and definite active sites for LiPSs. In this paper, we summarized the latest developments in enhancing the electrochemical performance of cathode for Li-S batteries through introducing different SACs. Furthermore, we briefly introduced the catalytic mechanism of SACs and discussed the strategies of synthesizing SACs, including the spatial confinement strategy and the coordination design strategy. Finally, the challenges and prospects in this field are proposed. We believe that this review would help to design and fabricate high-performance Li-S batteries via introducing SACs and boost their practical application.",Chinese Chemical Letters,10.1016/j.cclet.2022.01.014
"Efficient polysulfide conversion by Fe-N/C active sites anchored in N, P- doped carbon for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries","© 2022Lithium-Sulfur batteries have become one of the most promising energy storage systems due to their ultra-high energy density, environmental friendliness, and low cost. However, the sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LPS) and its shuttling effects have impeded the practical applications of Li-S batteries. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomically dispersed metal-based sites have been applied as a promising candidate for electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries. Herein, we design and demonstrate a single atom Fe-N/C catalyst impregnated with N, P–doped carbon (FeN6–NPC), N, P–doped carbon material (NPC), as well as Fe2P nanoparticles anchored with N, P–doped carbon (Fe2P–NPC). In-depth XANES and FT-EXAFS analyses were used to characterize the precise architecture of SACs containing Fe-N/C active sites. The electrochemical results of SACs with Fe-N/C active site configuration reveal the highest catalytic lithium polysulfide conversion compared to the NPC and nanoparticle anchored samples. In addition, the SACs enable FeN6–NPC/S electrode to deliver a high discharge capacity of 1115 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and maintain 570 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles with excellent Columbic efficiency (>99%). This work successfully develops organic-based strategies for SACs that suppress lithium polysulfide formation, improve cyclic stability, and increase Coulombic efficiency for lithium-sulfur batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166132
Double-active-site enables 2D B2S and B2S3 catalyst with suppressed shuttle effect and improved polysulfides redox kinetics in lithium-sulfur batteries: A first-principles study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The sluggish transformation kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the notorious shuttle effect induced by the emergence of highly soluble LiPSs have become the main obstacles preventing the application of lithium-sulfur batteries. The development of bifunctional catalysts capable of accelerating the LiPSs redox kinetics and anchoring these soluble LiPSs is highly desirable for achieving improved cycling performance and Coulombic efficiency. Herein, a two-dimensional B2S/B2S3 catalyst with atomically dispersed boron and sulfur sites was investigated as a potential additive to boost the anchoring of soluble LiPSs and the subsequent LiPSs transformation reaction. Based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrated that the adsorption strengths of soluble LiPSs on B2S/B2S3 monolayers are neither strong nor weak. This effectively inhibits the dissolution of LiPSs while retaining their structural integrity. Importantly, B2S/B2S3 exhibits remarkable catalytic activity toward the liquid-solid (Li2S4 to Li2S2) and solid-solid (Li2S2 to Li2S) reactions in the discharging process as well as the decomposition of Li2S in the charging process. This is crucial for achieving improved rate performance. Moreover, a high Li-ion mass transfer efficiency on B2S and B2S3 was achieved with Ebar values of 0.43 and 0.41 eV, which is beneficial for reducing diffusion-dependent polarization issues. Our results provide an alternative route for developing advanced sulfur cathode catalysts with a suppressed shuttle effect and desirable rate performance.",Applied Surface Science,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154295
Atomically Dispersed Fe-N4 Sites and Fe3C Particles Catalyzing Polysulfides Conversion in Li-S Batteries,"© 2022, Jilin University, The Editorial Department of Chemical Research in Chinese Universities and Springer-Verlag GmbH.Lithium-sulfur(Li-S) batteries have been puzzled by the “shuttle effect”. In the recent years, catalytic materials present a huge potential for solving this problem. However, the exploitation for catalytic activity was still challenging in Li-S batteries. In this article, we put forward a single atom catalyst (SAC) of FeN4 coupled with Fe3C on the N-doped carbon (FeN4/Fe3C@NC) by one-step pyrolysis method. The FeN4 and Fe3C synergistically catalyze the polysulfides conversion when the N-doped carbon provides the high conductive three-dimensional skeleton in Li-S batteries. As a result, the FeN4/Fe3C@NC shows a specific capacity of 1100 mA·h/g at 0.2 C(1 C=1675 mA/g). In addition, the FeN4/Fe3C@NC maintains 99.01% of the pristine specific capacity after 100 cycles at 0.5 C, indicating the improved electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries. This work sheds new lights on the design of engineering catalysts for developing high-performance Li-S batteries.

Electronic structure adjustment of lithium sulfide by a single-atom copper catalyst toward high-rate lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022Electrocatalytically reducing the energy barrier for Li2S deposition/dissociation is a promising strategy for high-rate Li-S batteries. However, the catalytic sites would be covered by the insulating Li2S product during discharge, which deteriorates the catalytic activity. Here, suggested by first-principles calculations, single-atom copper (SA-Cu) was screened out to endow the insulator-to-metal transition of adsorbed Li2S in view of the electronic structure. In addition to the thermodynamically reduced redox energy barrier, metallic Li2S nuclei deposited on SA-Cu decorated nitrogen-doped carbon fiber foam (SA-Cu@NCNF) with favorable electronic transport present 3D spherical clusters rather than conventional 2D lateral morphology by continuous 3D nucleation and growth. The Li2S deposition capacity and the catalytic efficiency of Li2S-covered catalytic sites are thus greatly improved. As a result, SA-Cu@NCNF based Li-S cells with a sulfur loading of 4 mg cm−2 retained an areal capacity of 1.60 mAh cm−2 at 5 C after 500 cycles (0.038% decay per cycle). A competitive areal capacity of 8.44 mAh cm−2 was obtained at 0.2 C with a sulfur loading of 10 mg cm−2. The demonstration of the distinctive design of catalysts to adjust the electronic structure of adsorbed Li2S paves the way for developing high-rate and long-life Li-S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.07.024
Ultrahigh-Content Co-P Cluster as a Dual-Atom-Site Electrocatalyst for Accelerating Polysulfides Conversion in Li–S Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) show high catalytic efficiency in accelerating conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS), and are thus promising for suppressing the shuttle effect observed in lithium−sulfur batteries (LSBs); however, single-atom catalytic sites with low content of catalysts largely restrict their catalytic effect. Herein, a Co-P cluster supported by a N-doped carbon matrix (Co-P cluster/NC) with atomic-level dispersion and an ultrahigh content (25.5 wt.%) of Co atoms is fabricated via an in situ low-temperature phosphorization strategy and employed as a dual-atom-site catalyst for catalyzing LiPS conversion. The Co-P cluster/NC with abundant unsaturated Co-P coordination provides dual-atom sites of Co and P to dynamically adsorb/desorb sulfur species and Li+ ions, respectively, synergistically promoting the conversion of LiPS. The dual-atom-site catalytic mechanism is evidenced by substantial characterizations including X-ray absorption fine structure measurements and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, the S@Co-P cluster/NC cathode shows superior cycling and rate performance. Even at a high sulfur loading of 6.2 mg cm−2, a high areal capacity of 6.5 mAh cm−2 that surpasses most commercial lithium–ion batteries can be achieved. This study opens a new avenue in the development of advanced catalysts with new catalytic mechanisms for high-performance LSBs.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202207579
"Sacrificial Template Method to Synthesize Atomically Dispersed Mn Atoms on S, N-Codoped Carbon as a Separator Modifier for Advanced Li-S Batteries","© 2022 American Chemical Society.Efficient and durable electrocatalysts are important for polysulfide conversion in high-performance Li-S batteries. Herein, we report a sacrificial template strategy to synthesize a sulfur/nitrogen-codoped carbon-supported manganese (Mn) single-atom catalyst (Mn/SNC). The synthesis is enabled by fabricating a novel precursor, i.e., cadmium sulfide (CdS) wrapped with Mn ion-impregnated polyporrole (CdS@Mn-PPy), and subsequent pyrolysis. During pyrolysis, the CdS template is decomposed into Cd and S, PPy-derived carbon is doped with N and S, and Mn ions are reduced to Mn atoms, forming Mn-N active sites. The evaporation of Cd atoms/clusters creates abundant pores in the carbon substrate to expose the active sites and facilitate ion transport, and S atoms can form edge C-S-C bonds to improve the activity of Mn-N sites. Benefiting from the above advantages, the Mn/SNC catalyst markedly enhances the performance of Li-S batteries, delivering an initial capacity of 1563.7 mAh g-1 at 0.1C, a capacity decay of only 0.037% per cycle after 1600 cycles at 2C; a capacity of 1045.1 mAh g-1 at a high sulfur loading of 7.44 mg cm-2 at 0.2C, and a capacity retention of 73.1% after 180 cycles. This work provides a strategy that may benefit further the rational design and development of single-atom catalysts for application in renewable energy.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.2c12114
Coaxially grafting conjugated microporous polymers containing single-atom cobalt catalysts to carbon nanotubes enhances sulfur cathode reaction kinetics,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) hold great potential for use in energy related applications due to their extended π-conjugated structures, tunable pore sizes, and modular molecular functionalities. Herein, we report a novel composite material (labeled as Co-CMP-MWNTs) that consists of a CMP containing Co single-atom catalysts (Co SACs) and being coaxially grafted to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and show that the material synergistically promotes the cathode reaction kinetics in lithium−sulfur (Li−S) batteries. The Co-CMP-MWNTs are synthesized by coupling 2,4,6-tris(4-ethynylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine to a dibromobipyridine-Co complex in the presence of bromopyrimidinyl-functionalized MWNTs. The composite features a conductive MWNT-based core and a CMP-based shell that contains nitrogen as well as Co. Cs-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy reveal that the Co species exist as single atoms. Additional XANES data coupled with density functional theory calculations elucidate the adsorption interactions formed between the Co SACs and various sulfur species as well as their electrocatalytic effects. Li−S cells prepared using Co-CMP-MWNTs as a cathode host material exhibit excellent performance in terms of specific capacity (1485 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C), rate capability (602 mA h g−1 at 3 C), and cycling stability (510 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C after 1000 cycles, which corresponds to a capacity decay of 0.050% per cycle). Collectively, the results demonstrate that SACs can be prepared under benign conditions and used to enhance sulfur cathode reaction kinetics. The methodology described may be extended to enable the use of SACs in other contemporary energy conversion technologies.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.136546
Multifunctional Atomic Molybdenum on Graphene with Distinctive Coordination to Solve Li and S Electrochemistry,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The improvement of lithium–sulfur batteries is still impeded by notorious shuttling effect and sluggish kinetics on the S cathode, and rampant Li dendrite formation on the Li anode makes it worse. Herein, a type of single-atom dispersed Mo on nitrogen-doped graphene (Mo/NG) with a distinctive Mo-N2O2-C coordination structure first serving as a multifunctional material is designed by a structure-oriented strategy to solve Li and S electrochemistry. Mo/NG with superior intrinsic properties endowed by the unique coordination configuration adsorbs soluble polysulfides and promotes bidirectional conversion of LiPSs at the cathode side. Meanwhile, the suitable binding strength of Mo/NG with lithium ions endows it with an attractive lithiophilic feature. Specifically, Mo/NG is able to work as the adaptor to redistribute lithium ions on the interface of separator and homogenize the lithium ion flux. Due to the suitable binding ability with Li+, it does not interfere with the diffusion of lithium ions across and provides tunnels exclusive to lithium ions to generate fast and homogeneous flux. Ascribed to such unique multifunctionality, Li–S batteries assembled with Mo/NG exhibit excellent electrochemical performance including long cycling stability over 1000 cycles and high areal capacities under high sulfur mass loading.",Small,10.1002/smll.202203947

Siloxene, a new 2D nanomaterial with three types of structures (Weiss, chain like, and Kautsky), is regarded to be a promising cathode-supporting material for Li–S batteries. Herein, a series of 3d transition metal single-atom embedded siloxenes (TM-SA-siloxenes) is designed and their potential in Li–S batteries is evaluated by first-principles calculations. It is found that Weiss-siloxene shows the best polysulfide anchoring ability and lowest Gibbs free energy for the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR). Among a series of TM-SA-siloxenes, Co-SA-siloxene is identified as the optimal candidate. It shows moderate adsorption energies for polysulfides and outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for SRR and Li2S decomposition, as well as excellent electronic conductivity. It is also revealed that suitable d and p band center positions, obvious hybridization between Co–3d and S–3p orbitals, and more charge obtained from adsorbed polysulfides, contribute to the high redox kinetics of Co-SA-siloxene for the catalyzing conversion of polysulfides. These interesting results provide valuable theoretical guidance for the study of siloxene-based cathode host materials for Li–S batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials,10.1002/aenm.202201530
Theoretical and Experimental Understanding of Metal Single-Atom Electrocatalysts for Accelerating the Electrochemical Reaction of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Metal single-atom materials have attracted tremendous attention in the research field of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries because they can effectively improve the reaction kinetics of sulfur cathodes. However, it is still difficult to determine the best metal single-atom catalyst for Li-S batteries, due to the lack of a unified measurement and evaluation method. Herein, a series of metal single-atom- A nd nitrogen-doped graphene materials (M-NG, M = Fe, Co, Ni, Ir, Ru) have been prepared as the catalysts for promoting the reaction kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction process. Using rotating disk electrode measurements and density functional theory-based theoretical calculations, Ni-NG was screened out to be the best catalyst. It is found that Ni-NG materials can provide a kinetically favorable pathway for the reversible conversion of polysulfide conversion, thus increasing the utilization of sulfur. By coating the Ni-NG materials on the separator as a multifunctional interlayer, a commercially available sulfur cathode presents a stable specific capacity of 701.8 mAh g-1 at a current rate of 0.5C over 400 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading of 3.8 mg cm-2, a high areal capacity of 4.58 mAh cm-2 can be achieved.

Etch-evaporation enabled defect engineering to prepare high-loading Mn single atom catalyst for Li-S battery applications,"© 2022Excellent specific discharge capacity and cycling stability are essential for high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, but hard to achieve simultaneously due to the shuttle effect and sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfides. Herein, we report an etch-evaporation enabled defect engineering strategy to fabricate atomically dispersed, manganese-nitrogen doped porous carbon (Mn-N-C) for separator modification. With Zinc atoms evaporation and NH3 etch, abundant spatial confinement sites and N dopants are created in Mn-N-C, and the final Mn loading can reach as high as 2.31 wt%. Density function theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mn atoms in Mn-N-C play a crucial role in polysulfides adsorption and electrical conductivity enhancement. Therefore, the Mn-N-C modified separator can exhibit high conductivity, strong immobilization and excellent catalytic activity, thus favoring polysulfides conversion and Li2S nucleation/dissolution. The Li-S battery equipped with the modified separator exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1596 mAh g−1 at 0.1C (S loading mass was 1.2 mg cm−2), which decays 0.045 % per cycle after 1000 cycles at 1C. Our work demonstrates that the etch-evaporation enabled defect engineering strategy is effective for fabrication of high-performance Li-S battery catalyst; it also shows an attractive prospect to synthesize other high loading metal ion dispersed, nitrogen doped carbon materials for electrochemical applications.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2022.136258
Oxygen-Plasma-Treated Fe-N-C Catalysts with Dual Binding Sites for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Enhanced polysulfide conversion kinetics is essential for realizing lithium-sulfur batteries with high energy density and rate performance and promising cyclability. The modification of the local atomic structure of MNxactive sites in single-atom M-N-C catalysts was proposed to improve their electrocatalytic activity for demanding reactions by fine-tuning the interaction with reaction intermediates. Here, we demonstrate that engineering the binding geometry of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by introducing dual binding sites improves the LiPS conversion kinetics. We use mild oxygen plasma treatment to introduce oxygen species into the Fe-N-C catalyst. The plasma-treated Fe-N-C (pFeNG) catalyst with dual sulfiphilic (mononuclear iron) and lithiophilic (oxygen) binding sites has a lower polysulfide decomposition energy, especially for Li2S redox, which is known to be the most sluggish process.

Strengthened d-p Orbital Hybridization through Asymmetric Coordination Engineering of Single-Atom Catalysts for Durable Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Although single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been largely explored in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, the commonly reported nonpolar transition metal-N4 coordinations only demonstrate inferior adsorption and catalytic activity toward shuttled lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, single Fe atoms with asymmetric coordination configurations of Fe-N3C2-C were precisely designed and synthesized as efficient immobilizer and catalyst for LiPSs. The experimental and theoretical results elucidate that the asymmetrically coordinated Fe-N3C2-C moieties not only enhance the LiPSs anchoring capability by the formation of extra π-bonds originating from S p orbital and Fe dx2-y2/dxy orbital hybridization but also boost the redox kinetics of LiPSs with reduced Li2S precipitation/decomposition barrier, leading to suppressed shuttle effect. Consequently, the Li-S batteries assembled with Fe-N3C2-C exhibit high areal capacity and cycling stability even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions. This work highlights the important role of coordination symmetry of SACs for promoting the practical application of Li-S batteries.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c02183

Yet, the heterostructures with unique structures as well as the regulation of heterointerface electronic structure are still challenging for high-performance Li–S batteries. Herein, Pt single-atoms (SAs)-regulated heterostructures of In2S3/Ti3C2 binary nanosheets (Pt SAs/In2S3/Ti3C2) are facilely constructed via an ultrasound-assisted photochemical reduction strategy for dendrite-free and kinetics-enhanced Li–S batteries. The as-designed heterostructures of Pt SAs/In2S3/Ti3C2 on separator can stabilize the Li plating/striping on Li anodes even at a high current density of 5 mA cm−2. In addition, Pt SAs/In2S3/Ti3C2 heterostructure can suppress the polysulfide shuttling and exhibit excellent redox electrocatalytic properties for lithium polysulfides decomposition.

Designing multifunctional electrocatalysts with improved activity and abundant active sites to regulate the dynamics for sulfur electrochemistry is still a significant challenge. Herein, we proposed a thiourea assisted pyrolysis combined with hard template method to synthesize cobalt single atoms co-coordinated by N and S atoms embedded hollow carbon spheres (Co-NS-HCS) as a novel sulfur host. The Co-NS-HCS mainly consists of well-dispersed Co-N3S-C center sites where Co is co-bonded by N and S atoms.

These limitations can potentially be overcome using easy-to-infiltrate sulfur hosts with high catalytic materials. However, catalytic materials in such hosts are very susceptible to agglomeration due to the lack of efficient confinement in easy-to-infiltrate structures. Herein, using carbon dots as an aggregation limiting agent, the successful fabrication of self-supporting carbon nanofibers (CNF) containing Ni-single-atoms (NiSA) and uniformly dispersed Ni-nanoparticles (NiNP) of small sizes as multifunctional sulfur hosts is reported. The NiSA sites coordinated by such NiNP offer outstanding catalytic activity for sulfur reactions and CNF is an easy-to-infiltrate sulfur host with a large-scale preparation method. Accordingly, such hosts that can be prepared on a large scale enable sulfur cathodes to exhibit high sulfur utilization (66.5 mAh cm−2 at ≈0.02 C) and cyclic stability (≈86.1% capacity retention after 100 cycles at ≈0.12 C) whilst operating at a high sulfur loading (50 mg cm−2) and low E/S (5 µL mg−1).

Nonetheless, its development is plagued by the severe polysulfide shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics. Although single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a promising remedy to expedite sulfur redox chemistry, the mediocre single-atom loading, inferior atomic utilization, and elusive catalytic pathway handicap their practical application. To tackle these concerns, in this work, unsaturated Fe single atoms with high loading capacity (≈6.32 wt%) are crafted on a 3D hierarchical C3N4 architecture (3DFeSA-CN) by means of biotemplated synthesis. By electrokinetic analysis and theoretical calculations, it is uncovered that the 3DFeSA-CN harnesses robust electrocatalytic activity to boost dual-directional sulfur redox. As a result, S@3DFeSA-CN can maintain a durable cyclic performance with a negligible capacity decay rate of 0.031% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 1.0 C. More encouragingly, an assembled Li–S battery with a sulfur loading of 5.75 mg cm−2 can harvest a high areal capacity of 6.18 mAh cm−2. This work offers a promising solution to optimize the carbonaceous support and coordination environment of SACs, thereby ultimately elevating dual-directional sulfur redox in pragmatic Li–S batteries.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202202256

Self-supported Film Electrodes Decorated with Single Atoms for Energy Electrocatalysis 自支撑单原子膜电极在能源电催化中的应用,"© 2022, Editorial Department of Chem. J. Chinese Universities. All right reserved.Single-atom catalysts(SACs) have been widely studied in energy electrocatalysis due to their high catalytic activity, excellent selectivity and maximized atom utilization efficiency. However, the powdery SACs were mostly evaluated at small current densities(typically<100 mA/cm2) with low electrode loading(typically<1.0 mg/cm2) due to the complex preparation process of the working electrode, the addition of polymeric binder that would decrease the electrical conductivity and bury the active sites. In contrast, self-supported single-atom film electrodes not only possess the merits of SACs, but also have the advantages of monolithic structure, such as the omission of polymeric and conductive additives, improved electrical conductivity, enhanced exposure of single-atom sites and adjustable morphology and porosity, making them highly promising to be applied in high-current-density catalytic reactions and high-energy/power-density batteries. In this review, the recent advances of self-supported film-based SACs in energy electrocatalysis are presented. Firstly, the advantages of self-supported film-based SACs are discussed. Sub- sequently, their synthetic approaches are summarized, including in situ preparation on a self-supported substrate, electrostatic spinning, self-assembly, chemical vapor deposition and solid phase diffusion. Then, the applications of self-supported film-based SACs in various energy-related electrocatalytic processes are introduced, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, H2O2 electrosynthesis, zinc-air batteries, carbon dioxide reduction reaction and lithium sulfur batteries. Finally, the development direction of self-supported film-based SACs is prospected.",Gaodeng Xuexiao Huaxue Xuebao/Chemical Journal of Chinese Universities,10.7503/cjcu20220051
"Three dimensional self-supporting Co, N, S co-doped porous carbon derived from paulownia wood for Li-O2 batteries 锂-氧气电池用泡桐木衍生三维自支撑Co、N、S共掺杂多孔炭","© 2022, Editorial Board of CIESC Journal. All right reserved.Lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries are considered as the most promising new generation energy storage devices because of their high theoretical energy density and environmental friendliness. However, large overpotential, low practical energy density and poor cycle life are the huge obstacles to their practical application. Since the insoluble and insulating discharge products (Li2O2) gradually form on the surface or in the pores of cathode during the discharging process, these products will block the diffusion channel of O2/electrolyte and cover the catalytic active sites. In addition, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) require noble-metal-based materials as catalyst to reduce the overpotential and achieve high electrochemcial efficiency. However, high cost and scarcity of the noble-metal catalysts hinder their large scale applications. Development of economically viable and highly efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts is extremely urgent, especially for heteroatom-doped carbons as the most promising candidates. In this paper, a novel Co, N and S co-doped three-dimensional self-standing porous carbon (wd-NSC) was prepared as cathode for Li-O2 battery using melamine and thiourea as nitrogen and sulfur sources via one-step pyrolysis of paulownia wood in NaCl/CoCl2 mixed molten salt medium. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results found that the wd-NSC inherited the original vertical channel structure of paulownia wood, and formed porous carbon fiber network on the surface and inside the channels of wd-NSC. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that N and S were successfully doped into the C skeleton, while Co might exist in the form of single atom or clusters. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms showed that the wd-NSC possess hierarchical porous structure with pore sizes ranging from micropore to macropore. Raman spectra certified that the introduction of S increased the defect degree of wd-NSC. At a current density of 0.05mA/cm2, the discharge specific capacity of wd-NSC reached to 12.83mA·h/cm2, and exhibited a good rate capability and cycling stability (at a current density of 0.1mA/cm2 and a limited capacity of 0.5mA·h/cm2, the cell can maintain 125 cycles). The excellent electrochemical performance of wd-NSC in the Li-O2 battery could be attributed to the synergistic effect of three-dimensional hierarchical porous structure and Co, N, S heteroatoms co-doping. The above results demonstrated that this study provided a promising strategy to produce efficiency and low-cost cathodes for practical application in Li-O2 batteries.",Huagong Jinzhan/Chemical Industry and Engineering Progress,10.16085/j.issn.1000-6613.2021-1011
Role of the Metal Atom in a Carbon-Based Single-Atom Electrocatalyst for Li-S Redox Reactions,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Carbon-based single metal atom catalysts (SACs) are being extensively investigated to improve the kinetics of the Li–S redox reaction, which is greatly important for batteries with cell-level energy densities >500 W h kg-1. However, there are contradictory reports regarding the electrocatalytic activities of the different metal atoms and the role of the metal atom in Li-S chemistry still remains unclear. This is due to the complex relationship between the catalytic behavior and the structure of carbon-based SACs. Here, the catalytic behavior and active-site geometry, oxidation state, and the electronic structure of different metal centers (Fe/Co/Ni) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene, and having similar physicochemical characteristics, are studied. Combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and electrochemical analysis, it is revealed that the coordination-geometry and oxidation state of the metal atoms are modified when interacting with sulfur species. This interaction is strongly dependent on the hybridization of metal 3d and S p-orbitals. A moderate hybridization with the Fermi level crossing the metal 3d band is more favorable for Li-S redox reactions. This study thus provides a fundamental understanding of how metal atoms in SACs impact Li-S redox behavior and offers new guidelines to develop highly active catalytic materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.",Small,10.1002/smll.202200395
Uncovering electrocatalytic conversion mechanisms from Li2S2 to Li2S: Generalization of computational hydrogen electrode,"© 2022Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have been strongly considered as promising next-generation batteries due to their significant advantages on theoretical energy density. However, the practical application of Li–S batteries are seriously impeded by the sluggish conversion reaction from Li2S2 to Li2S. The solution of this problem relies on comprehensive understanding of Li2S2 conversion mechanisms. Herein, a theoretical model is established by generalizing the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) approach. More specifically, Li2S2 conversion is redefined in elementary steps that includes the participation of each electron. Associative and dissociative reaction mechanisms with electrocatalysts are proposed and inspected by the free energy criterion. Single atom catalysts containing Fe, Co, Ni, and V are discussed separately. The effects of applied electrode potential are accurately described by the generalized CHE approach. It is predicted that associative reaction mechanism can provide the highest electrode potential with the existence of Fe single atom catalysts. Analysis on electronic structures further confirms the electrocatalysis activity originates from the chemical bonds between S and transition metal atoms. This work unveils the Li2S2 conversion mechanisms in elementary steps. More importantly, the generalized CHE approach opens a new frontier of exploration on redox reactions in Li–S battery and hopefully other energy storage systems.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.02.002
Implanting Single Zn Atoms Coupled with Metallic Co Nanoparticles into Porous Carbon Nanosheets Grafted with Carbon Nanotubes for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is severely hindered by the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, an integrated composite catalyst consisting of Co nanoparticles and single-atom (SA) Zn co-implanted in nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets grafted with carbon nanotubes (Co/SA-Zn@N-C/CNTs) is rationally developed toward this challenge. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the synergistically dual active sites of Co and atomic Zn-N4 moieties with an optimal charge redistribution not only strongly confine the LiPSs but also effectively catalyze its conversion reactions by lowering the energy barrier from Li2S2 to Li2S while the N-doped porous carbon-grafted CNTs enables a large surface area for more active site exposure and provides a fast electron/ion pathway. Benefiting from synergies, Li-S batteries equipped with the Co/SA-Zn@N-C/CNTs-based sulfur cathode exhibit a high reversible capacity of 1302 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and a low capacity fading rate of 0.033% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C. Moreover, a high areal capacity of 4.5 mAh cm−2 at 0.2 C with the sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm−2 can be achieved. The present work may provide new insight into the design of high-performance sulfur-based cathodes for Li-S batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202200424
Atomic Structure Modification of Fe‒N‒C Catalysts via Morphology Engineering of Graphene for Enhanced Conversion Kinetics of Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom M‒N‒C catalysts have attracted tremendous attention for their application to electrocatalysis. Nitrogen-coordinated mononuclear metal moieties (MNx moities) are bio-inspired active sites that are analogous to various metal-porphyrin cofactors. Given that the functions of metal-porphyrin cofactors are highly dependent on the local coordination environments around the mononuclear active site, engineering MNx active sites in heterogeneous M‒N‒C catalysts would provide an additional degree of freedom for boosting their electrocatalytic activity. This work presents a local coordination structure modification of FeN4 moieties via morphological engineering of graphene support. Introducing highly wrinkled structure in graphene matrix induces nonplanar distortion of FeN4 moieties, resulting in the modification of electronic structure of mononuclear Fe. Electrochemical analysis combined with first-principles calculations reveal that enhanced electrocatalytic lithium polysulfide conversion, especially the Li2S redox step, is attributed to the local structure modified FeN4 active sites, while increased specific surface area also contributes to improved performance at low C-rates. Owing to the synergistic combination of atomic-level modified FeN4 active sites and morphological advantage of graphene support, Fe‒N‒C catalysts with wrinkled graphene morphology show superior lithium–sulfur battery performance at both low and high C-rates (particularly 915.9 mAh g−1 at 5 C) with promising cycling stability.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202110857
Active site construction to boost electrochemical property for Li–S batteries: a review,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, as a research hotspot, are expected to address the need for energy storage systems with high energy density. However, the slow reaction kinetics of polysulfides due to the loss of electrical contact of soluble polysulfides and further shuttle effect hinder the further progression of Li–S batteries. This paper reviews the recent efficient approach to remedy the above issues: active site construction in the electrode materials or separators. The active site construction includes the increasing surface area, inducing molecular and single-atom catalysts, inducing heteroatomic doping, vacancies, or functional group. The high specific surface area can provide more sites for loading sulfur and also the more active sites for adsorption. Many porous materials are designed to provide more transfer paths for ions. Molecular and single-atom catalysts use some catalysts such as Fe–N–C or single metal atoms in various matrixes, representing the high catalytic activity. Defects can improve the electronic conductivity to quicken lithium ions diffusion in electrode materials, but also render more active sites to enhance catalytic activity and adsorption of electrode materials, accelerating the conversion of long-chain polysulfides to the next short-chain polysulfides and final products Li2S2/Li2S. The common active site construction and characterization methods of diversiform materials, for example, carbon materials, metal oxides, metal sulfides, and some other metal-free materials, are reviewed in this paper.",Journal of Materials Science,10.1007/s10853-022-07082-2
Functional catalysts for polysulfide conversion in Li–S batteries: from micro/nanoscale to single atom,"© 2021, Youke Publishing Co.,Ltd.Lithium−sulfur (Li–S) batteries have the advantages of low-cost and ultra-high energy density (2600 Wh·kg−1), which have attracted considerable attention. However, the practical application of Li–S batteries still suffers various intractable problems, such as low electrical conductivity, significant volume expansion, and the shuttle effect of sulfur cathode. Up to now, many tremendous efforts and significant progress have been devoted to settle these problems. One of the most effective strategies is that introducing metal-based compounds (e.g., metal oxides, -sulfides, -nitrides, carbides, -phosphate, single-metal compounds) to enhance the electrochemical performance of S cathode benefiting from superior adsorption/catalytic ability toward Li2Sn (n = 1, 2, 4, 8).

Coordinatively Deficient Single-atom Fe-N-C Electrocatalyst with Optimized Electronic Structure for High-performance Lithium-sulfur Batteries,"© 2021The rationally-designed single-atom catalyst that promotes efficient sulfur electrochemistry is highly desired yet still challenging for the development of high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, the deficient coordination of single-atom Fe site is firstly and theoretically predicted to endorse higher sulfur affinity and catalytic activity, due to the stronger hybridization between Fe 3dzz and S 3py orbitals compared with that in common FeN4 scenario. The following validation is conducted to prepare the monodispersed Fe single atoms with tuned coordination number on nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as FeN2-NC and FeN4-NC) via the ligand control on the Fe precursor. As expected, the undercoordinated FeN2-NC fulfills significantly stronger sulfur immobilization and catalyzation as confirmed by a series of physicochemical and electrochemical evaluations. As a result, sulfur electrodes hosted by FeN2-NC realize excellent cyclability and rate capability, and particularly, a highly reversible areal capacity up to 4.5 mAh cm−2 under a high areal sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm−2 and a low electrolyte to sulfur ratio of 5.3 mL g−1.

P-block tin single atom catalyst for improved electrochemistry in a lithium-sulfur battery: A theoretical and experimental study,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Main group metals are routinely considered as catalytically inactive. Hence, they are never employed for optimizing lithium-sulfur electrochemistry. Herein, density functional theory calculations reveal that atomically dispersed tin on a nitrogen-doped carbon substrate is expected to be highly active for electrocatalysis because of the activation of underfilled p orbitals and a significant shift of the p band center towards the Fermi level upon metal-support interaction. Under theoretical guidance, we prepared a p-block tin single atom catalyst (SnSA-NC) with Sn-N4 as the active site for effectively improving the lithium-sulfur battery performance. The charge transfer between the Sn atom and N ligands creates a highly polar site that exhibits strong adsorption capability towards the electrolyte-soluble long-chain polysulfides. The unique p band structure of the central Sn atom modulates the energy barriers for the rate-determining steps of sulfur redox, thus facilitating the lithium polysulfide conversion. Besides, the exposure and utilization of Sn-N4 sites are maximized by virtue of the 13 nm thick nanosheet morphology of the carbon substrate. Remarkably, the functional separator modified by SnSA-NC increases the sulfur utilization by 79.7%, and endows the lithium-sulfur cells with significantly enhanced cyclability and rate performance. This work successfully expands the employment of main group metals for electrocatalysis applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta09422j
Axial chlorine coordinated iron-nitrogen-carbon single-atom catalysts for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Iron-nitrogen-carbon single-atom catalysts (Fe-N-C SACs) are promising low-cost catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to achieve carbon neutrality. However, their relatively low selectivity and activity are related to the strong binding of reaction intermediates (e.g., CO*) on single Fe atoms. Here, combining experimental and theoretical studies, we show that introducing axial chlorine (Cl) atom can modulate the electronic structure of Fe atoms in catalytically active FeN4 sites, which facilitates the desorption of CO* and inhibits the adsorption of H*, resulting in improved activity and selectivity in CO2RR. The Cl modified Fe-N-C SAC embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (FeN4Cl/NC) was synthesized in two steps: pyrolyzing Fe-loaded two-dimensional zeolite imidazole framework nanosheets and low-temperature incubation in hydrochloric acid solution. X-ray absorption spectroscopy results reveal that most atomically dispersed Fe atoms are coordinated with one axial Cl atom at 2.26 Å and four N atoms at 2.02 Å. The optimized FeN4Cl/NC exhibits a CO Faradaic efficiency of 90.5%, a high current density of 10.8 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of 490 mV, and a high turnover frequency of 1566 h−1, one of the best among recently reported Fe-based CO2RR catalysts. FeN4Cl/NC was further applied as a bifunctional catalyst to construct rechargeable zinc-CO2 batteries, delivering a power density of 0.545 mW cm−2 with excellent stability over 15 h. Tailoring the coordination environment of metal atoms in M-N-C SACs by introducing axial atoms may be further extended as an efficient general approach to design advanced catalysts for various electrochemical applications, such as fuel cells, nitrogen fixation, and lithium-sulfur batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal,10.1016/j.cej.2021.132882
Single-atom catalysts for lithium sulfur batteries via atomic layer deposition process,"© 2022 The Author(s)Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) has emerged as one of the foremost intriguing energy storage systems in the last decade, due to its higher energy density (ED), less expensive, and more environmentally friendly. However, the interface chemistries of electrode–electrolyte such as the shuttling effect of polysulfide and inadequate dynamic sulfur use have not yet been completely understood and managed when in operations, thus the employment of single-atom catalysts (SACs) provides the possibility to address these problems through the proper identification of structure–activity connexions and the chemical reaction processes at the atomic level. In this mini review, the usage of incredibly active SACs is examined with applications in long-lifecycle, higher-energy LSBs, as well as the possibility of SAC preparation using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to boost efficiency.

An Exfoliation–Evaporation Strategy To Regulate N Coordination Number of Co Single-Atom Catalysts for High-Performance Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietySingle-atom catalysts (SACs) with metal–nitrogen (M–N) moiety are effective in boosting the redox kinetics of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. However, the precise preparation of SACs with controllable M–N coordination number remains challenging and the relationship between M–N coordination number and polysulfide redox kinetics is still unexplored. Herein, a novel exfoliation-evaporation strategy assisted by molten salt is proposed to fabricate Co SACs (named Co–Nx) with different N coordination numbers for Li–S batteries. The key of this strategy is to exfoliate layered Co-based ZIF-L precursors into N-doped graphene with abundant dispersed Co atoms by molten salt and then control Co–N coordination number by selectively introducing Zn evaporation to promote C–N fragments release. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that highly unsaturated Co–N2 with asymmetric electron distribution immobilizes LiPSs, accelerates LiPSs conversion, and promotes Li2S deposition/dissociation more effectively than Co–N4 through stronger chemical interactions. As a result, Co–N2 endows Li–S batteries with long cycle life (0.05% capacity decay per cycle for 700 cycles), excellent rate capability (687 mAh g–1 at 5 C), and high areal capacity of 8.2 mAh cm–2 at a high loading of 7.0 mg cm–2. This work provides an effective strategy to fabricate SACs with controllable N coordination number and establishes the relationship between M–N coordination number and LiPSs redox kinetics, motivating future rational design of SACs for high-performance Li–S batteries.",ACS Materials Letters,10.1021/acsmaterialslett.1c00414

During pyrolysis, the pyrolytic HCl from confined NH4Cl within ZIF-8 will in situ etch ZIF-8 to produce rich mesoporous in the carbonized product NC(p). The mesoporous Ni-NC(p) enables favorable electron/ion transfer, high sulfur loading, and effective confinement of LiPSs, while the catalytic effect of single-Ni species enhances the redox kinetics of LiPSs. As a result, the sulfur cathode based on the Ni-NC(p) host delivers obviously improved Li-S battery performance with high specific capacity, good rate capability, and cycling stability.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,10.1002/anie.202212680
Nitrogen Balance on Ni–N–C Promotor for High-Energy Lithium-Sulfur Pouch Cells,"© 2022 The Authors.

Herein, the nitrogen evolution on hierarchical and atomistic Ni–N–C electrocatalyst, mainly pertaining to the essential subtraction, reservation and coordination of nitrogen atoms, is manipulated to attain favorable Li–S pouch cell performances. Such rational evolution behavior realizes the “nitrogen balance” in simultaneously regulating the Ni–N coordination environment, Ni single atom loading, abundant vacancy defects, active nitrogen and electron conductivity, and maximizing the electrocatalytic activity elevation of Ni–N–C system.

Nevertheless, the polysulfide shuttle effects trigger fast capacity decay and short battery lifespan, severely hampering their practical utilizations. Herein, an efficient electrocatalyst comprising of nitrogen (N)-coordinated binary metal single atoms (SAs) implanted within a hierarchical porous carbon skeleton (Fe/Co-N-HPC) is constructed to trap and catalyze polysulfides conversion through a separator coating strategy. It is demonstrated that the introduction of Co atom can enrich the electron number of Fe active center, thereby realizing the distinct synergistic catalytic effect of binary metal SAs and improving the bidirectional catalysis of Li–S redox reaction. As a result, Li–S batteries with the Fe/Co-N-HPC-modified separator exhibit outstanding rate capability (740 mAh g−1 at 5.0 C), and superior long-term cyclic stability (694 mAh g−1 after 600 cycles at 1.0 C). Increasing the sulfur loading to 4.8 mg cm−2, a remarkable areal capacity of 6.13 mAh cm−2 is achieved.

Universal-Descriptors-Guided Design of Single Atom Catalysts toward Oxidation of Li2S in Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHThe sulfur redox kinetics critically matters to superior lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, for which single atom catalysts (SACs) take effect on promoting Li2S redox process and mitigating the shuttle behavior of lithium polysulfide (LiPs). However, conventional trial-and-error strategy significantly slows down the development of SACs in Li–S batteries. Here, the Li2S oxidation processes over MN4@G catalysts are fully explored and energy barrier of Li2S decomposition (Eb) is identified to correlate strongly with three parameters of energy difference between initial and final states of Li2S decomposition, reaction energy of Li2S oxidation and Li-S bond strength. These three parameters can serve as efficient descriptors by which two excellent SACs of MoN4@G and WN4@G are screened which give rise to Eb values of 0.58 and 0.55 eV, respectively, outperforming other analogues in adsorbing LiPs and accelerating the redox kinetics of Li2S. This method can be extended to a wider range of SACs by coupling MN4 moiety with heterostructures and heteroatoms beyond N where WN4@G/TiS2 heterointerface is predicted to exhibit enhanced catalytic performance for Li2S decomposition with Eb of 0.40 eV.

The host improved electrical conductivity, enhanced physical-chemical dual restricting capability toward LiPSs, and, more importantly, boosted the redox reaction kinetics by the Ni-N5 active moiety. Therefore, the Ni-N5/HNPC/S cathode exhibits superior rate performance, long-term cycling stability, and good areal capacity at high sulfur loading. This work highlights the important role of the coordination number of active centers in single-atom catalysts and provides a strategy to design a hollow nanoarchitecture with single-atom active sites for high-performance Li-S batteries.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c03499

Due to the peculiarity of complete lithiation and the capability to match non-lithium anodes, Li2S-based Li-S batteries have attracted more and more attention. Nevertheless, the same notorious shuttle effect of polysulfides as in traditional Li-S batteries and the poor conductivity of Li2S lead to sluggish conversion reaction kinetics, poor Coulombic efficiency, and cycling performance. Herein, we propose the interconnected porous carbon skeleton as the host, which is modified by an atomically dispersed Mn catalyst as well as O, N atoms (named as ON-MnPC) via the melt salt method, and introduce the Li2S nanosheet into the carbon host with poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) ethanol solution. It has been found that the introduction of O, N to bind with Mn atoms can endow the nonpolar carbon surface with ample unsaturated coordination active sites, restrain the shuttle effect, and enhance the diffusion of Li+ and accelerate the conversion reaction kinetics. Besides, due to the ultra-high catalyst activity of atomically dispersed Mn catalysts, the Li2S/ON-MnPC cathode shows good electrochemical performance, e.g., an initial capacity of 534 mAh g-1, a capacity of 514.18 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles, a high retention rate of 96.23%, and a decay rate of 0.04% per cycle. Hence, use of atomically dispersed Mn catalysts to catalyze the chemical conversion reactions of polysulfides from multiple dimensions is a significant exploration, and it can provide a brand-new train of thought for the development and commercialization of the economical, high-performance Li2S-based Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.1c18645
Engineering d-p Orbital Hybridization in Single-Atom Metal-Embedded Three-Dimensional Electrodes for Li–S Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle-atom metal catalysts (SACs) are used as sulfur cathode additives to promote battery performance, although the material selection and mechanism that govern the catalytic activity remain unclear. It is shown that d-p orbital hybridization between the single-atom metal and the sulfur species can be used as a descriptor for understanding the catalytic activity of SACs in Li–S batteries. Transition metals with a lower atomic number are found, like Ti, to have fewer filled anti-bonding states, which effectively bind lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalyze their electrochemical reaction. A series of single-atom metal catalysts (Me = Mn, Cu, Cr, Ti) embedded in three-dimensional (3D) electrodes are prepared by a controllable nitrogen coordination approach. Among them, the single-atom Ti-embedded electrode has the lowest electrochemical barrier to LiPSs reduction/Li2S oxidation and the highest catalytic activity, matching well with the theoretical calculations. By virtue of the highly active catalytic center of single-atom Ti on the conductive transport network, high sulfur utilization is achieved with a low catalyst loading (1 wt.%) and a high area-sulfur loading (8 mg cm−2). With good mechanical stability for bending, these 3D electrodes are suitable for fabricating bendable/foldable Li–S batteries for wearable electronics.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202105947
Size-Dependent Cobalt Catalyst for Lithium Sulfur Batteries: From Single Atoms to Nanoclusters and Nanoparticles,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe sulfur redox conversion with catalytically improved kinetics is promising to mitigate the polysulfides shuttling. While the size of electrocatalyst always brings different catalytic behaviors for various heterogeneous catalytic reactions, it is yet to be explored for Li-S batteries. Herein, a systematical study of size-dependent catalytic activity toward polysulfides conversion and the relevance to electrochemical performance are reported, by constructing Co catalysts with different atomic scales from single atoms, atomic clusters to nanoparticles. Fundamental electrocatalytic studies are focused by probing the reduction kinetics and activation energies of sulfur chemistry. The single atomic Co shows the best charge transfer/kinetic toward sulfur redox, especially for the rate-determining reaction (Li2S4 ↔ Li2S) as demonstrated by the significantly lowered energy barrier for Li2S nucleation/dissolution. This is owing to stronger geometric deformation of the catalyst with lower aggregation extent when it interacts with sulfur species, thus leading to decreased Gibbs free energy changes as elucidated by DFT calculations. The superior catalytic activity of single atomic Co promises a high specific capacity (4.98 mAh cm−2) at an areal loading of 4.3 mg cm−2 over long-term cycling. The finding emphasizes the significance of the size-dependent catalytic activity to the reaction kinetics and the overall performance of Li-S batteries.",Small Methods,10.1002/smtd.202100571
A Conjugated Porous Polymer Complexed with a Single-Atom Cobalt Catalyst as An Electrocatalytic Sulfur Host for Enhancing Cathode Reaction Kinetics,"© 2021Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) have shown great promise for use in contemporary energy applications owing to their unique structures and tunable functionality. Here, we report a CMP embedded with a single-atom Co catalyst (Co-CMP) as an electrocatalytic sulfur host for promoting the cathode reactions of lithium−sulfur (Li−S) batteries. The Co-CMP was synthesized by copolymerizing a dibromo salcyen Co complex with tris(ethynylthiophene)triazine using standard Sonogashira coupling methodology. In addition to featuring a single-atom catalyst (SAC), the Co-CMP possesses a high quantity of pyridinic nitrogen atoms and relatively large pore sizes that collectively facilitate sulfur cathode chemistry. The performance displayed by Li−S cells fabricated with the Co-CMP was outstanding when compared with cells that were devoid of a SAC, particularly in terms of specific capacity (1404 vs. 1338 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C), rate capability (766 vs. 613 mA h g−1 at 2 C), and cycling stability (549 vs. 314 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C). Density functional theory calculations in conjunction with X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy measurements revealed that the single-atom Co catalyst lowers the cathode reaction energies by forming bonding interactions with the polysulfide anions as well as the Li cations that are present in sulfur cathodes. Since the methodology is modular and obviates the extreme steps required by other approaches, it can be employed to synthesize new classes of CMPs containing SACs with predictable structures and functions for use in a broad range of contemporary catalytic applications.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2021.05.043
Cobalt coordination with pyridines in sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathodes to form conductive pathways and catalytic M-N4S sites for accelerated Li-S kinetics,"© 2021 Science PressSulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) represents a unique class of cathode material for lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries as it eradicates the polysulfides shuttling issue in carbonate-based electrolyte. However, due to the essential chemical S-linking and organic nature of SPAN, the active mass percentage and rate capability are two bottleneck issues preventing its ultimate deployment outside of laboratories. In the current work, aiming to endow both the charge conductivity and catalytic activity to SPAN for maximizing the redox kinetics of S conversion, a freestanding nanofibrous SPAN cathode embedding conductive CNTs and atomically dispersed Co centers is fabricated via multivariate electrospinning. While the CNTs enable dramatically enhancing the fiber conductivity and generating mesoscopic porosity for facilitating charge and mass transportation, the cross-linking of SPAN by Co-N4S motifs creates extra charge conduction pathways and further serves as the catalytic active sites for expediting redox S conversion. As a result, an extraordinary Li-SPAN performance is achieved with a high specific capacity up to 1856 mAh g−1@0.2 C, a superb rate capability up to 10 C, and an ultra-long battery life up to 1500 cycles@1 C. Consequently, our study here provides insights into the adoption of coordination chemistry to maximize the sulfur utilization by ensuring a more complete redox conversion from SPAN to Li2S, and vice versa.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.01.012
Modulating the electronic structure of nanomaterials to enhance polysulfides confinement for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is one of the most promising next-generation energy storage systems. Nevertheless, owing to the high solubility of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in the ether-based electrolyte, plenty of LiPSs shuttle between cathode and anode under an electric field. This shuttle effect corrodes the lithium metal, and thus causes serious capacity fading, which is regarded as a major barrier to the commercial application of Li-S batteries. Engineering the surficial structure of nanomaterials can promote affinity between cathode and LiPSs, while simultaneously facilitating redox kinetics of LiPSs, leading to a low concentration of LiPSs in electrolyte for restraining the shuttle effect. Herein, we review recent progress in manipulating the electronic structure of nanomaterials featuring high conductivity, strong absorption and catalytic properties for Li-S batteries. We first discuss the mechanism of the conversion of LiPSs with different pathways. Moreover, we showcase the design strategies of nanomaterials with the modulated surface, including heterostructures, deficiency strategy, heteroatom-doping strategy and metal-single-atom catalyst.

Single-Atom Catalysts as Promising Cathode Materials for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.A major challenge toward the practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is the lithium polysulphide (LiPS) shuttling, caused by the rapid LiPS migration in the electrolyte and slow reaction kinetics. Single-atom catalyst (SAC) materials hold the promise of strong LiPS binding to the cathode and improved reaction kinetics in Li-S batteries. In this study, we examine the electrocatalytic properties of four SAC materials with TM-N4-C (TM = Co, Fe, V, and W) formation, from simulations based on the density functional theory. We study for the first time a W-based SAC as the Li-S cathode host and calculate the adsorption energy of five LiPS intermediates (Li2Sn, n = 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8). We explore the mechanism for the conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S and present the energy profiles based on the Gibbs free energy for the LiPS reaction pathway from S8 to Li2S. V- and W-based SACs provide high LiPS binding, of up to 6.0 times of pristine graphene, and largely improved reaction kinetics by lowering the S dissociation barrier of the Li2S2 decomposition by ∼2.5 times compared to pristine graphene. Our work provides a detailed investigation into the adsorption and conversion of LiPSs on SAC cathode hosts, highlighting their potential on improving the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries and mitigating the LiPS ""shuttle""effect.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c04491
Single-Atom Zinc and Anionic Framework as Janus Separator Coatings for Efficient Inhibition of Lithium Dendrites and Shuttle Effect,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.The two key problems for the industrialization of Li-S batteries are the dendrite growth of lithium anode and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, we report the Janus separator prepared by coating anionic Bio-MOF-100 and its derived single-atom zinc catalyst on each side of the Celgard separator. The anionic metal-organic framework (MOF) coating induces the uniform and rapid deposition of lithium ions, while its derived single-atom zinc catalyzes the rapid transformation of LiPSs, thus inhibiting the lithium dendrite and shuttle effect simultaneously. Consequently, compared with other reported Li-S batteries assembled with single-atomic catalysts as separator coatings, our SAZ-AF Janus separator showed stable cyclic performance (0.05% capacity decay rate at 2 C with 1000 cycles), outstanding performance in protecting lithium anode (steady cycle 2800 h at 10 mAh cm-2), and equally excellent cycling performance in Li-SeS2 or Li-Se batteries.

Herein, machine learning based on high-throughput density functional theory calculations is employed to establish the pattern of polysulfides adsorption and screen the supported single-atom catalyst (SAC). The adsorptions are classified as two categories which successfully distinguish S-S bond breaking from the others. Moreover, a general trend of polysulfides adsorption was established regarding of both kind of metal and the nitrogen configurations on support. The regression model has a mean absolute error of 0.14 eV which exhibited a faithful predictive ability. Based on adsorption energy of soluble polysulfides and overpotential, the most promising SAC was proposed, and a volcano curve was found.

Atomic Tungsten on Graphene with Unique Coordination Enabling Kinetically Boosted Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Use of catalytic materials is regarded as the most desirable strategy to cope with sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) transformation and severe shuttle effect in lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs).

Engineering Fe–N Coordination Structures for Fast Redox Conversion in Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHCritical drawbacks, including sluggish redox kinetics and undesirable shuttling of polysulfides (Li2Sn, n = 4–8), seriously deteriorate the electrochemical performance of high-energy-density lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. Herein, these challenges are addressed by constructing an integrated catalyst with dual active sites, where single-atom (SA)-Fe and polar Fe2N are co-embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene (SA-Fe/Fe2N@NG). The SA-Fe, with plane-symmetric Fe-4N coordination, and Fe2N, with triangular pyramidal Fe-3N coordination, in this well-designed configuration exhibit synergistic adsorption of polysulfides and catalytic selectivity for Li2Sn lithiation and Li2S delithiation, respectively. These characteristics endow the SA-Fe/Fe2N@NG-modified separator with an optimal polysulfides confinement–catalysis ability, thus accelerating the bidirectional liquid–solid conversion (Li2Sn↔Li2S) and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, a Li–S battery based on the SA-Fe/Fe2N@NG separator achieves a high capacity retention of 84.1% over 500 cycles at 1 C (pure S cathode, S content: 70 wt%) and a high areal capacity of 5.02 mAh cm−2 at 0.1 C (SA-Fe/Fe2N@NG-supported S cathode, S loading = 5 mg cm−2). It is expected that the outcomes of the present study will facilitate the design of high-efficiency catalysts for long-lasting Li–S batteries.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.202100171
Catalytic separators with Co-N-C nanoreactors for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 the Partner Organisations.Rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising next-generation energy storage devices because of their high theoretical energy density. However, the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in an ether electrolyte and its sluggish reaction kinetics severely limit their practical performances. Herein, an atomically dispersed supported metal catalyst with a Co-N4 structure on active carbon (Co-N-C/AC) is prepared and introduced to modify the separators of Li-S batteries. The Co-N-C catalyst not only suppresses the shuttle effect of LiPSs through the physical barrier and chemical affinity but also improves the redox kinetics of the sulfur species. The first-principles calculation indicates that LiPSs on Co-N-C possess a high binding energy and low decomposition energy barrier in the electrochemical process, thus effectively accelerating the conversion of LiPSs during the charge/discharge process and improving sulfur utilization in Li-S batteries. Therefore, a Li-S battery based on a Co-N-C/AC modified separator can deliver admirable rate performance and stable cycling life with a reversible discharge capacity of over 865 mA h g-1 and a decay rate of 0.043% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1.0 C.

Single atom catalysts supported on N-doped graphene toward fast kinetics in Li-S batteries: A theoretical study,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.To suppress the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and promote fast kinetics of the charge-discharge process in Li-S batteries, it is essential to search for promising catalysts with sufficient stability and high activity. Here, we employ density functional theory to explore the performance of 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals embedded in nitrogen-doped defective graphene (M@N/G, including M@N3/G and M@N4/G) as single atom catalysts toward fast kinetics in Li-S batteries. Four evaluation criteria of M@N/G are established to guide the screening of catalysts. Electronic structure analysis shows that the nitrogen coordination environment can largely tune the valence orbital splitting of the metal center and further affect the intrinsic activity of catalysts; M@N4/G exhibits superior catalytic performance to M@N3/G. We also found that sulfur-metal interactions play a critical role in the adsorption and activation of sulfur species on M@N/G. We therefore propose to use the sulfur atom adsorption free energy as a descriptor of catalytic activity combined with the knowledge of M3d@N/G to effectively predict the activity of M4d,5d@N/G. As a result, we expect that the Sc, Cr, Mn, Ru, Os, and Ir single metal atom catalysts supported on N4/G have better than or at least comparable catalytic performance to the ever-reported V, Fe, and Co@N4/G for Li-S batteries. In particular, because of the low cost, Cr@N4/G and Mn@N4/G are preferentially recommended with a small free energy change of the rate-determining step (0.62 eV and 0.54 eV) during discharge and a low decomposition barrier of ∗Li2S (1.42 eV and 1.29 eV) during charge simultaneously. Our study builds a novel screening strategy and can guide future theoretical study on catalysts toward Li-S batteries with fast kinetics.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/d1ta01948a
Single Atom-Based Nanoarchitectured Electrodes for High-Performance Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHLithium−sulfur (Li−S) batteries have attracted particular interest as promising next-generation energy storage devices because of their high theoretical energy density and low cost. The real performance of Li−S batteries is, however, far from achieving the expected values, even when using a porous, highly conductive host of sulfurs to improve their electric conductivity and accommodate their volume changes. The performance restrictions are mainly attributable to the slow reaction kinetics of converting lithium polysulfides species to lithium sulfide and elemental sulfur during the charging and discharging processes, respectively. Recent studies show that single-atom catalysts (SACs) with superior catalytic activity offer an effective strategy for solving this tough issue. The recent advances in utilizing SACs for Li−S batteries, which involve catalyst preparation, battery performance, and mechanistic insights, are summarized here. Modification of the cathodes and separators with SACs helps to absorb polysulfide and promote their conversion kinetics, thus suppressing the notorious “shuttle effect.” In addition, the introduction of SACs into Li−S batteries promotes the efficiency of Li stripping/plating and prevents the growth of Li dendrites. Overall, the boost effects of SAC on Li−S batteries performance are noticeable and deserving of more research attention to develop better Li−S batteries.",Advanced Materials Interfaces,10.1002/admi.202002159

However, the practical specific energy and cycle life of Li–S pouch cells are significantly limited by the use of thin sulfur electrodes, flooded electrolytes and Li metal degradation. Here we propose a cathode design concept to achieve good Li–S pouch cell performances. The cathode is composed of uniformly embedded ZnS nanoparticles and Co–N–C single-atom catalyst to form double-end binding sites inside a highly oriented macroporous host, which can effectively immobilize and catalytically convert polysulfide intermediates during cycling, thus eliminating the shuttle effect and lithium metal corrosion. The ordered macropores enhance ionic transport under high sulfur loading by forming sufficient triple-phase boundaries between catalyst, conductive support and electrolyte. This design prevents the formation of inactive sulfur (dead sulfur). Our cathode structure shows improved performances in a pouch cell configuration under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte operation.

KGaA, WeinheimThe study of lithium–sulfur (Li-S) batteries has generated various rationally designed cathodes and modified separators. However, the shuttle of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the sluggish kinetics of transformation of LiPSs to Li2S2/Li2S still hinder the achievement of long-life cycling and high-rate of Li-S batteries.

Fast conversion and controlled deposition of lithium (poly)sulfides in lithium-sulfur batteries using high-loading cobalt single atoms,"© 2020Lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries are appealing energy storage technologies owing to their exceptional energy density. Their practical applications, however, are largely compromised by poor cycling stability and rate capability because of detrimental shuttling of polysulfide intermediates, complicated multiphase sulfur redox reactions, and uncontrolled precipitation of the discharge products (lithium sulfide, Li2S). Herein, monodispersed Co single-atom catalyst on conductive nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet (CoSA-N-C) with high Co content of 15.3 ​wt% was fabricated through a salt-template method and used as a sulfur host material to simultaneously alleviate the polysulfide shuttling, propel the redox kinetics of dissolved polysulfides, and mediate the deposition of Li2S. The robust two-dimensional architecture of CoSA-N-C with large surface area, high porosity, and dual lithiophilic-sulfiphilic Co–N species enable strong physical and chemical polysulfides confinement and fast electrons/ions transfer process. The densely populated Co–N4 coordinated moieties function as electrocatalytic sites to accelerate the reversible conversion between lithium polysulfides and Li2S. Importantly, the CoSA-N-C enables spatially controlled deposition of Li2S nanoparticles during the battery discharge process, as opposed to conventional Li2S passivation layers that fully covered the conductive host. Consequently, the as-fabricated cathodes based on the CoSA-N-C deliver high sulfur utilization (1574 mAh·g−1 at 0.05 ​C), outstanding rate capability (624 mAh g−1 at 5 ​C) and superior long-term stability (capacity fade rate of 0.035% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 1 ​C).

Bifunctional Atomically Dispersed Mo-N2/C Nanosheets Boost Lithium Sulfide Deposition/Decomposition for Stable Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.The sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) transformation is recognized as the main obstacle against the practical applications of the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery. Inspired by molybdoenzymes in biological catalysis with stable Mo-S bonds, porous Mo-N-C nanosheets with atomically dispersed Mo-N2/C sites are developed as a S cathode to boost the LiPS adsorption and conversion for Li-S batteries. Thanks to its high intrinsic activity and the Mo-N2/C coordination structure, the rate capability and cycling stability of S/Mo-N-C are greatly improved compared with S/N-C due to the accelerated kinetics and suppressed shuttle effect. The S/Mo-N-C delivers a high reversible capacity of 743.9 mAh g-1 at 5 C rate and an extremely low capacity decay rate of 0.018% per cycle after 550 cycles at 2 C rate, outperforming most of the reported cathode materials. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the Mo-N2/C sites can bifunctionally lower the activation energy for Li2S4 to Li2S conversion and the decomposition barrier of Li2S, accounting for its inherently high activity toward LiPS transformation.",ACS Nano,10.1021/acsnano.0c03325
Atomic-Scale Dispersed Fe-Based Catalysts Confined on Nitrogen-Doped Graphene for Li-S Batteries: Polysulfides with Enhanced Conversion Efficiency,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium-sulfur batteries have been considered as potential electrochemical energy-storage devices owing to their satisfactory theoretical energy density. Nonetheless, the inferior conversion efficiency of polysulfides in essence leads to fast capacity decay during the discharge/charge cycle. In this work, it is successfully demonstrated that the conversion efficiency of lithium polysulfides is remarkably enhanced by employing a well-distributed atomic-scale Fe-based catalyst immobilized on nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe@NG) as a coating of separator in lithium-sulfur batteries. The quantitative electrocatalytic efficiency of the conversion of lithium polysulfides is determined through cyclic voltammetry. It is also proven that the Fe-NX configuration with highly catalytic activity is quite beneficial for the conversion of lithium polysulfides. In addition, the adsorption and permeation experiments distinctly indicate that the strong anchoring effect, originated from the charge redistribution of N doping into the graphene matrix, inhibits the movement of lithium polysulfides. Thanks to these advantages, if the as-prepared Fe@NG catalyst is combined with polypropylene and applied as a separator (Fe@NG/PP) in Li-S batteries, a high initial capacity (1616 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C), excellent capacity retention (93 % at 0.2 C, 70 % at 2 C), and superb rate performance (820 mA h g−1 at 2 C) are achieved.",Chemistry - A European Journal,10.1002/chem.202001282
Insights into the Anchoring of Polysulfides and Catalytic Performance by Metal Phthalocyanine Covalent Organic Frameworks as the Cathode in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.The outstanding advantages of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have made them a potential energy storage device. However, shuttle effect is one of the main problems that restrict the commercial application of Li-S batteries. Apart from it, accelerating the dissociation of Li2S to LiS and Li+ is also very important to achieve high Coulombic efficiency. Recently, it has been found that metal atoms exhibit strong interactions with lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx), which can be used as single-atom catalysts by embedding in the matrix. Covalent organic framework (COF) materials have porous structures and large surface area, which can anchor Li2Sx by introducing active sites. In this study, we constructed metal phthalocyanine COFs (MPc-COFs, M = Ti, V, Mn, Cu, and Zn) as the cathode, which combined the advantages of metal atoms and COFs. The adsorption and catalysis performance of Li2Sx species were investigated by MPc-COF cathode using density functional theory. The results show that the strong adsorption capacity of TiPc-COF and VPc-COF and the formation of axial complexes make them unfavorable for Li-S batteries. MnPc-COFs show excellent conductivity and sulfur fixation capacity, which also have a lower energy barrier in the catalytic oxidation of Li2S. This work has a guiding significance in the design of catalytic electrodes for Li-S batteries.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c02563
Single-Atomic Catalysts Embedded on Nanocarbon Supports for High Energy Density Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium–sulfur batteries are among the most promising candidates for next-generation energy-storage systems due to its high theoretical energy density. However, the shuttle effect of polysulfides and sluggish reaction kinetics severely hinder the development of practical Li–S batteries. Merely depending on an adsorption strategy to resist the shuttle effect is insufficient to boost the overall electrochemical conversion reaction. Recently, single atom catalysts (SACs) have been used to solve this problem by decreasing the energy barriers of sulfur-species interconversion and Li2S decomposition. Herein, the research progress made in using SACs in Li–S batteries is discussed, focusing on their functions and catalytic mechanism. The challenges and prospects for future application of SACs in electrochemical energy-storage systems are also discussed.",ChemSusChem,10.1002/cssc.202000702
Catalytic Conversion of Polysulfides on Single Atom Zinc Implanted MXene toward High-Rate Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAlthough lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are one of the most promising energy storage devices owing to their high energy densities, the sluggish reaction kinetics and severe shuttle effect of the sulfur cathodes hinder their practical applications. Here, single atom zinc implanted MXene is introduced into a sulfur cathode, which can not only catalyze the conversion reactions of polysulfides by decreasing the energy barriers from Li2S4 to Li2S2/Li2S but also achieve strong interaction with polysulfides due to the high electronegativity of atomic zinc on MXene. Moreover, it is found that the homogenously dispersed zinc atoms can also accelerate the nucleation of Li2S2/Li2S on MXene layers during the redox reactions. As a result, the sulfur cathode with single atom zinc implanted MXene exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1136 mAh g−1. After electrode optimization, a high areal capacity of 5.3 mAh cm−2, high rate capability of 640 mAh g−1 at 6 C, and good cycle stability (80% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 4 C) can be achieved.",Advanced Functional Materials,10.1002/adfm.202002471
"Single-atom catalysis enables long-life, high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries","© 2020, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.With high energy density and low material cost, lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) emerge quite expeditiously as a fascinating energy storage system over the past decade. Broad applications of LSBs ranging from electric vehicles to stationary grid storage seem rather bright in recent literatures. However, there still exist many pressing challenges to be addressed because we do not yet fully understand and control the electrode-electrolyte interface chemistries during battery operation, such as polysulfide shuttling and poor utilization of active sulfur. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) pave new possibilities of tackling the tough issues due to their decent applicability in the atomic-level identification of structure-activity relationships and reaction mechanism, as well as their structural tunability with atomic precision. This review comprehensively summarizes the very recent advances in utilization of highly active SACs for LSBs by stating and discussing the related publications, which involves catalyst synthesis routes, battery performance, catalytic mechanisms, optimization strategies, and promises to achieve long-life, high-energy LSBs. We see that endeavors to employ SACs to modify sulfur cathode have allowed efficient polysulfide conversion and confinement, leading to the minimization of shuttle effect. Parallel efforts are being devoted to extending the scope of SACs to cell separator and lithium metal anode in order to unlock the full potential of LSBs. We also obtain mechanistic insights into battery chemistries and nature of SACs in their strong interactions with polysulfides through advanced in situ characterizations documented. Overall, acceleration in the development of LSBs by introducing SACs is noticeable, and this cutting edge needs more attentions to further promoting the design of better LSBs.

Single atomic cobalt catalyst significantly accelerates lithium ion diffusion in high mass loading Li2S cathode,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.It is widely accepted that catalysts in batteries can decrease the energy barriers of conversion reactions. However, little attention has been paid to their influence on ionic diffusion in the electrode or across the interface. Herein, we report that lithium ion diffusivity can be significantly accelerated in an intrinsically electrode by atomically-distributed metal catalyst. Electrochemical measurements have found single atomic cobalt catalyst embedded in a nanocarbon network is capable of increasing the kinetics of lithium ion, providing rapid conversion reaction rate in an ultrahigh-rate Li2S battery. Meanwhile, density functional theory simulations have revealed that the lithium ion diffusion barrier on a nanocarbon surface is highly sensitive to the dopant atoms and can be decreased by introduction of cobalt atoms. The synergetic effects of the well-known Li2S decomposition catalysis and the lithium ion diffusion acceleration allow us to achieve a high Li2S mass loading cathode with superior rate performance and reversibility. The as-prepared Li2S electrode converted from cheap Li2SO4 precursors can deliver a high rate capacity (441 ​mA ​h ​g-1 based on Li2S at 10 ​C) and long lifespan for 1500 cycles at 2 ​C with average capacity fading of 0.04% per cycle. Impressively, the high areal mass loading cells display a specific capacity of 340 ​mA ​h ​g-1 based on Li2S mass at 23.4 ​mA ​cm-2 (5 ​C) and a long cycle life (2.26 ​mA ​h ​cm-2 at 6.77 ​mA ​cm-2 after 200 cycles), which have not been reported for Li2S cathodes.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2020.03.023
Iron single-atom catalyst anchored on nitrogen-rich MOF-derived carbon nanocage to accelerate polysulfide redox conversion for lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been strongly considered the most promising candidate for next-generation energy storage devices owing to their higher energy density. However, the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish conversion kinetics during charge/discharge cycling impede the LSBs. Herein, we employed the nanocage-like nitrogen-rich metal organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon decorated with an iron single-atom (FeSA-CN) catalyst to trigger the surface-mediated reaction of LiPSs. The synergistic effect from the iron single atom (FeSA) and nitrogen-rich porous carbon significantly boost the reaction kinetics and utilization of the sulfur species. The FeSA-CN/S electrode delivered a specific capacity of 1123 mA h g-1 at 0.2C, and exhibited an excellent rate performance of 605 mA h g-1 at 4.0C with an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.06% per cycle for 500 cycles. This work provides an effective strategy to couple the function of a nanoporous material host and single-atom catalyst for lithium sulfur batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A,10.1039/c9ta11680j
Theoretical Calculation Guided Design of Single-Atom Catalysts toward Fast Kinetic and Long-Life Li-S Batteries,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are promising next-generation energy storage technologies due to their high theoretical energy density, environmental friendliness, and low cost. However, low conductivity of sulfur species, dissolution of polysulfides, poor conversion from sulfur reduction, and lithium sulfide (Li2S) oxidation reactions during discharge-charge processes hinder their practical applications. Herein, under the guidance of density functional theory calculations, we have successfully synthesized large-scale single atom vanadium catalysts seeded on graphene to achieve high sulfur content (80 wt % sulfur), fast kinetic (a capacity of 645 mAh g-1 at 3 C rate), and long-life Li-S batteries. Both forward (sulfur reduction) and reverse reactions (Li2S oxidation) are significantly improved by the single atom catalysts. This finding is confirmed by experimental results and consistent with theoretical calculations. The ability of single metal atoms to effectively trap the dissolved lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalytically convert the LiPSs/Li2S during cycling significantly improved sulfur utilization, rate capability, and cycling life. Our work demonstrates an efficient design pathway for single atom catalysts and provides solutions for the development of high energy/power density Li-S batteries.",Nano Letters,10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b04719
Single Nickel Atoms on Nitrogen-Doped Graphene Enabling Enhanced Kinetics of Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have arousing interest because of their high theoretical energy density. However, they often suffer from sluggish conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) during the charge/discharge process. Single nickel (Ni) atoms on nitrogen-doped graphene (Ni@NG) with Ni–N4 structure are prepared and introduced to modify the separators of Li–S batteries. The oxidized Ni sites of the Ni–N4 structure act as polysulfide traps, efficiently accommodating polysulfide ion electrons by forming strong Sx 2−⋅⋅⋅NiN bonding. Additionally, charge transfer between the LiPS and oxidized Ni sites endows the LiPS on Ni@NG with low free energy and decomposition energy barrier in an electrochemical process, accelerating the kinetic conversion of LiPS during the charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the large binding energy of LiPS on Ni@NG also shows its ability to immobilize the LiPS and further suppresses the undesirable shuttle effect. Therefore, a Li–S battery based on a Ni@NG modified separator exhibits excellent rate performance and stable cycling life with only 0.06% capacity decay per cycle. It affords fresh insights for developing single-atom catalysts to accelerate the kinetic conversion of LiPS for highly stable Li–S batteries.",Advanced Materials,10.1002/adma.201903955
Single-Atom Coated Separator for Robust Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are strong contenders among lithium batteries due to superior capacity and energy density, but the polysulfide shuttling effect limits the cycle life and reduces energy efficiency due to a voltage gap between charge and discharge. Here, we demonstrate that graphene foam impregnated with single-atom catalysts (SACs) can be coated on a commercial polypropylene separator to catalyze polysulfide conversion, leading to a reduced voltage gap and a much improved cycle life. Also, among Fe/Co/Ni SACs, Fe SACs may be a better option to be used in Li-S systems. By deploying SACs in the battery separator, cycling stability improves hugely, especially considering relatively high sulfur loading and ultralow SAC contents. Even at a metal loading of ∼2 μg in the whole cell, an Fe SAC-modified separator delivers superior Li-S battery performance even at high sulfur loading (891.6 mAh g-1, 83.7% retention after 750 cycles at 0.5C). Our work further enriches and expands the application of SACs catalyzing polysulfide blocking and conversion and improving round trip efficiencies in batteries, without side effects such as electrolyte and electrode decomposition.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.9b05628
Cobalt in Nitrogen-Doped Graphene as Single-Atom Catalyst for High-Sulfur Content Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Because of their high theoretical energy density and low cost, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are promising next-generation energy storage devices. The electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries largely depends on the efficient reversible conversion of Li polysulfides to Li2S in discharge and to elemental S during charging. Here, we report on our discovery that monodisperse cobalt atoms embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene (Co-N/G) can trigger the surface-mediated reaction of Li polysulfides. Using a combination of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first-principles calculation, we reveal that the Co-N-C coordination center serves as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to facilitate both the formation and the decomposition of Li2S in discharge and charge processes, respectively. The S@Co-N/G composite, with a high S mass ratio of 90 wt %, can deliver a gravimetric capacity of 1210 mAh g-1, and it exhibits an areal capacity of 5.1 mAh cm-2 with capacity fading rate of 0.029% per cycle over 100 cycles at 0.2 C at S loading of 6.0 mg cm-2 on the electrode disk.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.8b12973
Single-atom catalyst boosts electrochemical conversion reactions in batteries,"© 2018High energy barrier originated from the sluggish ion kinetics is considered to be a major obstacle for achieving high discharge rates in advanced battery systems, especially for electric vehicle applications. Herein, for the first time we show that the single atom catalyst can play a compelling role in boosting the electrochemical conversion kinetics and achieving previously-unreachable ultra-high-rate performance. Both experimental and theoretical results prove that atomically-dispersed single iron atoms promote the delithiation of relatively-inert Li2S cathode and accelerate the reversible electrochemical conversion reactions during its long-term cycling. The work demonstrates the effectiveness of single atom catalysis in improving the performance of Li2S/Li batteries (588 mAh g−1 at 12 C and capacity fading rate of 0.06% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 5 C) and opens a new route to breaking the rate limit for other future conversion-based high energy batteries.",Energy Storage Materials,10.1016/j.ensm.2018.09.006
