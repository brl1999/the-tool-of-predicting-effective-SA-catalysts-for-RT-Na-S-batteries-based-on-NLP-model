Robust electronic coupling of carbon nanoboxes with synergetic CoFe Alloy nanoparticles boosting efficient electrocatalytic oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The atomically interfacial engineering combined with the rational architecture design is of significant important for developing promising oxygen electrocatalysts towards efficient energy-related applications, but still remains a grand challenge. Herein, we report numerous CoFe alloy nanoparticles, with tunable compositions, anchored firmly over the well-designed oxygen-dopants-rich carbon nanoboxes (CoFe@C NBs) as an active electrocatalyst for electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is fabricated via a facile cation exchange and pyrolysis strategy. Thanks to the robust interfacial electronic coupling and the highly-exposed synergetic bimetallic centers, this optimized CoFe-27 @C NBs with the Co: Fe atomic ratio of 5.4: 1 could exhibit superior activity, excellent long-term stability and high methanol tolerance during a long-term ORR operation, with an excellent half-wave potential of 0.90 V and decent limiting current density of 5.4 mA cm−2, comparable with the commercial Pt/C catalysts and being one of the most active transition-metal ORR electrocatalysts developed. By the atomic-level synchrotron radiation characterizations and the detailed electrochemical measurements, it can be found that the strong electronic coupling at the metal-support interface could effectively promote the charge transfer and catalytic reaction kinetics, contributing to efficient 4e- ORR for CoFe-27 @C NBs.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
"Optical responses to hole defects in functionalized Ti3C2T2 (T = F, O, OH) MXenes","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.MXenes can exhibit unique physical properties by saturating the exfoliated layers with different functional groups, which have been designed for extreme conditions due to their superior resistance to high-temperature and radiation damage. In this study, we focus on the effects of possible hole defects caused by radiation on electronic structure and optical properties for three functionalized MXenes Ti3C2T2 (T = F, O, OH). The structure–activity relationship between different defect types and optical responses is established. Hole defects have a significant effect on the electronic structure of Ti3C2T2, which mainly modify the electronic distributions at deep energy level. In Ti3C2F2 and Ti3C2O2, the hole defects will break the localization of F p-orbital and O p-orbital and release more delocalized electrons. While, defects will bring more isolated peaks corresponding to the O-H bonds in the deep energy level of Ti3C2(OH)2. The optical absorption regions for these systems are mainly concentrated in the ultraviolet (UV) region with absorption onsets in the infrared range. For Ti3C2F2 and Ti3C2O2, the hole defects in triangle, diamond and hexagonal forms can significantly improve the light absorption intensity in the UV region. While for Ti3C2(OH)2, hole defects will strengthen the light response in the visible and infrared regions.",Applied Surface Science
A portable ascorbic acid in sweat analysis system based on highly crystalline conductive nickel-based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF),"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Conductive metal–organic frameworks can provide unique porous structures, large pore volumes, many catalytically active sites and high crystallinity, and so are becoming increasingly important and attractive as electrocatalytic materials. The present work synthesized nanorods of the conductive compound Ni3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) with a high degree of crystallinity from HITP ligands and Ni2+ ions. Screen-printed electrodes made with this material were employed to fabricate an enzyme-free sensor for the detection of ascorbic acid (AA). The sensor exhibited good catalytic activity during the electrocatalytic analysis of AA in alkaline media, attributed to the synergistic effect of highly active Ni-N4 catalytic sites in the nanorods, the two-dimensional superimposed honeycomb lattice of the Ni3(HITP)2, and the large specific surface area of this material. The latter property facilitated efficient electron transfer during catalytic oxidation. A portable electrochemical AA detection system was developed using Ni3(HITP)2 as the electrode material together with application-specific integrated circuits and a smartphone application with App. Good sensing performance was obtained, including a wide linear range (2–200 μM) with high sensitivity (0.814 μA μM−1 cm−2), and low detection limit (1 μM). This system can be used to monitor AA levels and trends in sweat to assess vitamin C intake as a part of personal health management.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Sandwich-like superstructure of in-situ self-assembled hetero-structured carbon nanocomposite for improving electrocatalytic oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Developing efficient and highly low-cost electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is highly desirable and challenging for renewable energy devices. In this work, a novel sandwich-like heterostructured nanocomposite was facilely constructed via incorporation of Co9S8 nanoclusters/Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocubes in N,S-doped carbon multilayers (Co9S8/Co3[Co(CN)6]2/N,S-CMLs) by a one-pot coordination-modulated pyrolysis of a mixture containing dicyandiamide, Co(NO3)2 and Evans blue at 800 °C. The control tests demonstrated critical roles of the pyrolysis temperature played on the final morphology and shape, and discussed the formation mechanism in detail. The as-prepared catalyst exhibited appealing electrocatalytic performance for ORR with a more positive onset potential (Eonset = 0.96 V vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.87 V vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, far outperforming other home-made catalysts and commercial Pt/C. This work opens a new avenue to prepare efficient, cost-effectiveness and stable electrocatalysts in sustainable energy storage and conversion devices.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Tailoring the oxidation state of metallic TiO through Ti3+/Ti2+ regulation for photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to C2H6,"© 2022The regulation and stabilization of the oxidation state to promote the conversion of CO2 to C2 fuel still faces many challenges. Based on the principle of charge balance, we creatively propose a co-doping strategy to adjust the surface oxidation state distribution of metallic catalysts. A TiO-based photocatalyst co-doped with Zn and N was synthesized by ammonia assisted one-step calcination method, named ZN-TC. XPS characterization shows that Zn and N adjust the valence states of adjacent Ti elements respectively, so that the surface of TiO maintains a relatively stable Ti3+/Ti2+ ratio. Under visible light irradiation, the material can catalyze CO2 into CO (324.11 μmol·g−1·h−1) and C2H6 (10.27 μmol·g−1·h−1) in the liquid phase. The selectivity of C2H6 reached 14.45%. When irradiated with near-infrared light, ZN-TC shows 100% CO selectivity because the photon energy is not enough to support the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. Theoretical calculations and experiments proved that Zn and N elements mainly act on the B-1 band to regulate the Ti valence state. In-situ DRIFTS and in-situ Raman tests confirmed the function of oxidation state adjustment to promote the C-C coupling on the catalyst surface to produce ethoxy groups, which ultimately led to the production of C2H6.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Thermotolerant and Li2Sn-trapped/converted separators enabled by NiFe2O4 quantum dots/g-C3N4 nanofiber interlayers: toward more practical Li-S batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The battery redox kinetics and operational reliability are two overriding concerns for current Li-S batteries (LSBs). When built up from the coin type to larger cells, LSBs are subjected to major issues of severe Li2Sn polysulfide shuttling and safety hazards if working in overheated conditions. To effectively intercept/solidify these shuttled molecules and elevate the LSB thermostability, we herein propose to make thermotolerant and Li2Sn-trapped/converted separators with functionalized interlayers, where highly catalytic NiFe2O4 quantum dots (QDs) are evenly distributed on intertwined g-C3N4 networks. In resulting separators, fluffy g-C3N4 nanofibers can impede the polysulfide shuttling well via physical confinement and chemisorption as well as enabling smooth charge transfer, while bimetallic QDs facilitate the catalytic conversion of intercepted polysulfides; in addition, using this interlayer will benefit the uniform deposition of Li at anode interfaces. Besides promotion in battery kinetics, our modified separators exhibit a reasonably high heat-resistance temperature beyond 170 °C. As evaluated, LSBs made using the designed separators achieve a large reversible capacity (1483.23 mA h g−1 at 0.2C), salient cycling stability (a capacity decay rate of less than 0.08% in 500 cycles) and good rate capabilities. Even with a higher S loading of ∼6.24 mg cm−2, full LSBs still deliver a remarkable capacity of ∼544 mA h g−1 (84% of initial discharging capacity) after cycling. Our work may trigger great research enthusiasm in making more efficient separators for LSBs with extended storage capacities and improve safety.",Materials Chemistry Frontiers
Waste Office Paper Derived Cellulose-Based Carbon Host in Freestanding Cathodes for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Due to large sulfur (S) content and simple manufacturing techniques, free-standing cathodes for lithium-sulfur (Li−S) batteries are gaining a lot of attention recently. Waste office paper, which is consumed in large quantities annually, was used to make a free-standing paper-based carbon (FPC) substrate, which inherited fiber-like morphology. In addition, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets modified FPC (rGO@FPC) host was also prepared by a vacuum filtration method. After S impregnation, the FPC/S and rGO@FPC/S free-standing cathodes were employed in Li−S batteries. The rGO@FPC/S free-standing cathode exhibited extremely competitive electrochemical performance, including a reversible discharge capacity of 315 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C after 500 cycles. This is due to the uniform S distribution, which boosts the utilization ratio, and the significant blocking action for polysulfide ions, which prevents the redox shuttle effect.",ChemElectroChem
Simultaneously Enhancing Catalytic Performance and Increasing Density of Bifunctional CuN3 Active Sites in Dopant-Free 2D C3N3Cu for Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reactions,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Atomically dispersed M-N-C has been considered an effective catalyst for various electrochemical reactions such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which faces the challenge of increasing metal load while simultaneously maintaining catalytic performance. Herein, we put forward a strategy for boosting catalytic performances of a single Cu atom coordinated with three N atoms (CuN3) for both ORR and OER by increasing the density of connected CuN3moieties. Our calculations first show that a single CuN3moiety exhibiting no catalytic performance for ORR and OER can be activated by increasing the density of metal centers, which weakens the binding affinity to *OH due to the lowered d-band center of the metal atoms. These findings stimulate the further theoretical design of a two-dimensional compound of C3N3Cu with a high concentration of homogeneously distributed CuN3moieties serving as bifunctional active sites, which demonstrates efficient catalytic performance for both ORR and OER as reflected by the overpotentials of 0.71 and 0.43 V, respectively. This work opens a new avenue for designing effective single-atom catalysts with potential applications as energy storage and conversion devices possessing high density of metal centers independent of the doping strategy and defect engineering, which deserves experimental investigation in the future.",ACS Omega
Construction of a Hollow Spherical Covalent Organic Framework with Olefin and Imine Dual Linkages Based on Orthogonal Reactions,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have widespread applications in many fields. However, successful attempts to construct COFs through the formation of two types of covalent bonds remain limited and challengeable. Here, we report the first example of a COF with olefin and imine dual linkages, which was enabled by orthogonal Schiff base reaction and the Knoevenagel condensation. The obtained COF-FD1 exhibits good stability and high selectivity in the fluorescence sensing of Fe3+ ions. Remarkably, this COF features a relatively rare hollow spherical morphology, and a time-dependent study of the continuous transformation from initial solid spherical to hollow spherical structures reveals an Ostwald ripening mechanism. This research not only demonstrates a new approach for the design and synthesis of COFs with dual linkages but also may bring about the possibility of constructing COFs with hollow structures.",Chemistry of Materials
Efficient Trimetallic Metal-Organic-Framework Derived Cu/Fe3C/N−C Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.A series of porous N-doped carbon electrocatalysts decorated with Cu and Fe3C, namely Cu/Fe3C/N−C-x-T (T=temperature, and x=Cu/Fe molar ratio), have been prepared for oxygen reduction by pyrolysis of trimetallic Cu/Fe/Zn MOF (MOF=Metal-Organic Framework) precursors with variable Cu/Fe molar ratio. It reveals that the Cu/Fe molar ratio has a great impact not only on the morphologies of Cu/Fe3C/N−C-x-T electrocatalysts but also on the catalytic performance toward oxygen reduction. In 0.1 M KOH solution, the optimal Cu/Fe3C/N−C-1-1000 electrocatalyst can compete with the Pt/C benchmark, showing Eonset (onset potential) of 0.95 V (vs. RHE) and E1/2 (half-wave potential) of 0.85 V (vs. RHE) (RHE=Reversible Hydrogen Electrode). Zinc-air battery with Cu/Fe3C/N−C-1-1000 as the cathode also delivers a maximal power density of 90 mW.cm−2, and demonstrates a little decay in potential after running for 40 hrs at 20 mA.cm−2.",Zeitschrift fur Anorganische und Allgemeine Chemie
Ru@Ni3S2 nanorod arrays as highly efficient electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Water splitting by electricity is believed to be a promising approach to obtain high-purity H2 on a large scale. Highly efficient electrocatalysts are of great importance for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we designed a highly efficient electrocatalyst (Ru@Ni3S2) for the HER by immersing Ni3S2 nanorod arrays into a RuCl3 aqueous solution. The obtained Ru@Ni3S2 with an increased electrochemical surface area and a decreased charge-transfer resistance demonstrates an enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the HER in alkaline media, suggested by an overpotential of −19.8 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 33.2 mV dec−1. Both the in situ formed Ru nanoparticles and the adsorbed Ru3+ ions are responsible for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced electrocatalytic HER activity of Ru@Ni3S2 compared with pure Ru can be ascribed to the lowered water dissociation energy barrier as well as the more favorable adsorption energy for the H intermediate (H*). During the long-term stability test, the adsorbed Ru3+ on the Ni3S2 nanorods would be converted to Ru(OH)3, leading to attenuated electrocatalytic activity. This drawback can be overcome by further surface modification with polyaniline (PANI). The obtained PANI-Ru@Ni3S2 exhibits a comparable catalytic HER activity to Ru@Ni3S2 but an extraordinary stability with continuous electrolysis at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 for 35 hours. Our design strategy here for synthesizing the Ru@Ni3S2 hybrid and effectively improving the stability of Ru-based catalysts could be extended to develop other noble metal/transition metal sulfides for practical water electrolysis and other applications.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers
Impact of Coordination Environment on Single-Atom-Embedded C3N for Oxygen Electrocatalysis,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Herein, utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have assessed the feasibility of single-atom-embedded C3N with various coordination environments of TM-C3, TM-C2N1, TM-C4, and TM-C2N2for oxygen electrocatalysis. It has been proved that most TM-CxNycandidates are stable and all of them possess metallic features to ensure fast electron transfer. Importantly, Co-C2N2is a bifunctional noble-free single-atom catalyst with low OER/ORR overpotentials (0.33/0.39 V). Furthermore, the impact of the coordination environment on the adsorption trend is revealed by the electronic properties of TM-CxNy. Considering that TM-d electron counts are multiplied by the sum of TM and C/N electronegativity, we propose a universal descriptor and offer more understanding of the coordination-activity correlation. Our findings not only show promising single-atom-embedded C3N candidates for oxygen electrocatalysis but also deeply unveil the impact of the coordination environment on catalytic activity.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
Electrocatalysis for Continuous Multi-Step Reactions in Quasi-Solid-State Electrolytes Towards High-Energy and Long-Life Aluminum–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Aluminum–sulfur (Al−S) batteries of ultrahigh energy-to-price ratios are a promising energy storage technology, while they suffer from a large voltage gap and short lifespan. Herein, we propose an electrocatalyst-boosting quasi-solid-state Al−S battery, which involves a sulfur-anchored cobalt/nitrogen co-doped graphene (S@CoNG) positive electrode and an ionic-liquid-impregnated metal–organic framework (IL@MOF) electrolyte. The Co−N4 sites in CoNG continuously catalyze the breaking of Al−Cl and S−S bonds and accelerate the sulfur conversion, endowing the Al−S battery with a shortened voltage gap of 0.43 V and a high discharge voltage plateau of 0.9 V. In the quasi-solid-state IL@MOF electrolytes, the shuttle effect of polysulfides has been inhibited, which stabilizes the reversible sulfur reaction, enabling the Al−S battery to deliver 820 mAh g−1 specific capacity and 78 % capacity retention after 300 cycles. This finding offers novel insights to design Al−S batteries for stable energy storage.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Revealing intrinsic spin coupling in transition metal-doped graphene,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Graphene materials offer attractive possibilities in spintronics due to their unique atomic and electronic structures, which is in contrast to their limited applications in the design of sophisticated spintronic devices. This should be attributed to the lack of knowledge about the intrinsic characteristics of graphene materials, especially the diverse correlations between sites within the materials and their roles in spin-signal generation and propagation. This work comprehensively studies the spin couplings between transition metal atoms doped on graphene and reveals their potential application in spintronic device design through the realization of various logic gates. In addition, the effects of the distance between doped metal atoms and the number of carbon layers on the logic gate implementation further verify that the spin-coupling effect can exhibit a certain distance dependence and space propagation. The achievements in this work uncover the potential value of graphene materials and are expected to open up new avenues for exploring their application in the design of sophisticated spintronic devices.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Research Progress and Improvement Strategy of High-performance Lithium Sulfur Battery 高性能锂硫电池研究进展与改进策略,"© 2022, Materials Review Magazine. All right reserved.With the consumption of fossil fuels and the rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs), portable devices and grid storage, traditional lithiu-mion batteries are unable to satisfy the ever-increasing demand of society. It is very important for researchers to explore for replaceable green new energy sources. In recent years, high-energy density and low-cost lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs) technology has received great attention. In theory, the area capacity of the cell cathode is directly determined by the sulfur content and the sulfur loading. Therefore, it is imperative to deve-lop high-performance lithium sulfur batteries (HLSBs) with high loading for improving the area capacity and energy density. However, the actual energy density of LSBs is far lower than its theoretical value. The main reasons can be summarized in the 'Shuttle effect' of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), the poor conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide (Li2S2/Li2S) and uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites. More importantly, the above-mentioned problems will become more serious when the sulfur loading increases to the practical application level. In response to these problems, researchers have designed various strategies to suppress the ""shuttle effect"" of LiPSs, such as physical coating, electrostatic repulsion and polar adsorption. Moreover, some nano-catalytic materials have attracted wide attention from researchers due to the polar effect, surface defects and other advantages. Therefore, researchers have successively developed various catalytic materials with different structures such as one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional to accelerate the redox reaction, which has effectively improved the cycle life and coulombic efficiency of LSBs. Although researchers have made great contributions in terms of cycle life, the commercialization prospects of the technology depend on whether it can be made into durable and safe battery system. Therefore, the researching teams has developed new functional electrolyte additives, high-performance separators and interlayers, and micro/nano-structured lithium anodes or lithium composite anodes to stabilize lithium anodes for improving battery safety. From the perspective of commercialization, the area capacity and energy density of LSBs need to reach 5 mAh•cm-2 and 500 Wh•kg-1 to meet the requirements of commercial EVs. Thus, researchers are not only improving battery performance, but also constantly increasing the sulfur loading to achieve higher energy density, which is closer to commercial requirements. In this review, the current development strategies for high performance HLSBs are presented and reviewed from three aspects including the suppression of LiPSs 'Shuttle effect', electrocatalysis strategy and overall safety strategy. These strategies have significant effects on inhibiting the 'Shuttle effect' and improving the utilization efficiency of active substances, especially on prolonging the cycle life and safety. At last, the future challenges and opportunities of high-performance HLSBs have also been indicated.",Cailiao Daobao/Materials Reports
Enhanced electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production from surface state modified mesoporous tin oxide catalysts,"© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Electrochemical hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production via the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has received much consideration as a substitute to the well-known industrial anthraquinone method. The present challenge in this area is developing appropriate cost-efficient materials with excellent electrocatalytic properties, durability, and product selectivity. This study examined electrocatalytic performance and selectivity toward H2O2 production of mesoporous SnO2 (meso-SnO2) electrodes prepared using a tunable hydrothermal process. After evaluating the effects of different NaCl concentrations and annealing conditions in the hydrothermal method, an electrode was developed with a significantly improved H2O2 production rate than the pristine material. Vacuum annealing led to materials with more surface defects. Meso-SnO2 annealed under vacuum exhibits distinctive electrochemical properties of two well-separated 2e− O2 reduction peaks to produce H2O2 as the main product compared to meso-SnO2 annealed in air. Most importantly, the introduction of surface oxygen vacancies into the meso-SnO2 crystal structure was determined to be a prominent approach to enhance its ORR performance in producing H2O2, showing great selectivity of above 85% at an onset potential of ∼0.6 VRHE. The vacancy-rich meso-SnO2 reveals enhanced electrocatalytic performance with ORR peak potential to be 0.6 VRHE, and the number of electron transfer numbers is 2.5, but greater durability in alkaline solutions. Thus, this work presents an innovative route for designing, synthesizing, and mechanistic examining enhanced SnO2-based catalytic materials for H2O2 production.",International Journal of Energy Research
A Review on the Construction of Carbon-Based Metal Compound Composite Cathode Materials for Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2022 Wang, Guo, Yang, Jin, Chen and Wang.Room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries are one of the most attractive energy storage systems due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and ultra-high energy density.

Deciphering the role of LiNO3 additives in Li-S batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The ultrahigh theoretical energy density of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries has attracted intensive research interest. However, most of the long-term cycling performance parameters are strongly dependent on the utilization of the electrolyte, which is considered as an indispensable component in Li-S batteries. Over the past few decades, numerous research studies around LiNO3 as an electrolyte additive have been carried out and have been confirmed to significantly upgrade the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries, but the mechanism of performance improvement is still not well-understood. In this minireview, we revisit the controversial issues surrounding LiNO3 based on recent representative studies, provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of LiNO3 in the Li-S battery system, and specifically discuss what the panoramic view of the solid electrolyte interface film formed by LiNO3 on the surface of Li metal anodes looks like. Finally, we present general conclusions and unique insights into the future development of Li-S batteries. This minireview aims to provide a tutorial reference for researchers who are ready to enter or are active in the field of Li-S batteries.",Materials Horizons

Anion π-πStacking for Improved Lithium Transport in Polymer Electrolytes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Polymer electrolytes (PEs) with excellent flexibility, processability, and good contact with lithium metal (Li°) anodes have attracted substantial attention in both academic and industrial settings. However, conventional poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based PEs suffer from a low lithium-ion transference number (TLi+), leading to a notorious concentration gradient and internal cell polarization. Here, we report two kinds of highly lithium-ion conductive and solvent-free PEs using the benzene-based lithium salts, lithium (benzenesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiBTFSI) and lithium (2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTPBTFSI), which show significantly improved TLi+and selective lithium-ion conductivity. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we pinpoint the strong π-πstacking interaction between pairs of benzene-based anions as the cause of this improvement. In addition, we show that Li°∥Li° and Li°∥LiFePO4cells with the LiBTFSI/PEO electrolytes present enhanced cycling performance. By considering π-πstacking interactions as a new molecular-level design route of salts for electrolyte, this work provides an efficient and facile novel strategy for attaining highly selective lithium-ion conductive PEs.",Journal of the American Chemical Society

All rights reserved.To improve the energy conversion efficiency and durability of zinc-air batteries (ZABs) for large-scale implementations, here we propose an ""air-breathing"" strategy to significantly enlarge triple-interfaces with intensified mass transfer. By dip-coating the aerophilic perfluorochemical compounds (PFC) and amphiphilic ionomers into the self-supported electrodes, (1) the high solubility of O2in the PFC nanoemulsions greatly increases triple-phase boundaries and facilitates the efficient supply/removal of O2from the electrolyte; (2) the ionomers with hydrophobic and hydrophilic functionalities enable fast gas, water, and ion transport to the triple-phase boundaries; and (3) the self-supported electrode without binder ensures fast electron transfer while the firm integration prevents catalyst shedding. By applying this strategy, the ZABs show a high power density of 115 mW cm-2and a narrow discharge/charge gap of 0.64 V at 10 mA cm-2and a long-cycling durability (over 1000 h). This work provides a universal approach to promote gas-evolving reactions for electrochemical applications.",Nano Letters
Freestanding Metal-Organic Frameworks and Their Derivatives: An Emerging Platform for Electrochemical Energy Storage and Conversion,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as ideal electrode materials and precursors for electrochemical energy storage and conversion (EESC) owing to their large specific surface areas, highly tunable porosities, abundant active sites, and diversified choices of metal nodes and organic linkers. Both MOF-based and MOF-derived materials in powder form have been widely investigated in relation to their synthesis methods, structure and morphology controls, and performance advantages in targeted applications. However, to engage them for energy applications, both binders and additives would be required to form postprocessed electrodes, fundamentally eliminating some of the active sites and thus degrading the superior effects of the MOF-based/derived materials. The advancement of freestanding electrodes provides a new promising platform for MOF-based/derived materials in EESC thanks to their apparent merits, including fast electron/charge transmission and seamless contact between active materials and current collectors. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of freestanding structures and MOF-based/derived materials, outstanding electrochemical performance in EESC can be achieved, stimulating the increasing enthusiasm in recent years. This review provides a timely and comprehensive overview on the structural features and fabrication techniques of freestanding MOF-based/derived electrodes. Then, the latest advances in freestanding MOF-based/derived electrodes are summarized from electrochemical energy storage devices to electrocatalysis. Finally, insights into the currently faced challenges and further perspectives on these feasible solutions of freestanding MOF-based/derived electrodes for EESC are discussed, aiming at providing a new set of guidance to promote their further development in scale-up production and commercial applications.",Chemical Reviews
Mo-Vacancies Defect Engineering of One-Dimensional Porous Mo2C Nanowires for Enhanced High-Efficiency Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The large-scale application of efficient water-splitting greatly promote the development of hydrogen economy which benefit both in alleviating the energy crisis and reaching the goal of carbon neutral. To realize considerable hydrogen evolution, rational design of catalysts with controllable structure and surface composition become crucial. In this work, we proposed an enhanced active site originated from Mo-vacancies defect in Mo2C crystal which was fabricated by the evaporation of Zn content in well-designed one-dimensional ZnMoO4 precursor. Density functional theory calculation and experimental results demonstrated that the formation of molybdenum vacancies in molybdenum carbide promoted the water adsorption and H2 desorption effectively, resulting in an excellent HER reaction dynamics. Moreover, one-dimensional porous nanowires also ensured rapid mass transfer and contributed strong support for superexcellence HER performance. As expected, V−Mo2C-900@NF exhibited extremely low overpotential (η10=43 mV) at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and rapid reaction kinetics (Tafel slope 77.89 mV dec−1).",ChemCatChem
Construction of three-dimensional cobalt sulfide/multi-heteroatom co-doped porous carbon as an efficient trifunctional electrocatalyst,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Exploring cost-effective non-precious metal electrocatalysts is vital for the large-scale application of clean energy conversion devices (i.e., fuel cells, metal-air batteries and water electrolysers). Herein, we present the construction of a three-dimensional cobalt sulfide/multi-heteroatom co-doped carbon composite as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through one-step sulfidation of zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) using sulfur powder as a sulfur source. By virtue of the distinct periodic metal-nitrogen coordination structure and the abundant micropores within the ZIF precursor, sub-10 nm Co9S8 nanoparticles (NPs) are homogenously anchored on a Co, S and N multi-heteroatom co-doped carbon framework with a large specific surface area that exposes sufficient reactive sites for these electrocatalytic reactions. The optimized Co9S8/CoNSC exhibits outstanding ORR, OER and HER performance, comparable or even superior to those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2. The small Co9S8 NPs and Co-Nx species embedded in the carbon matrix cooperatively catalyze the OER and ORR, while the HER catalysis is mainly contributed by Co9S8 NPs. Furthermore, the Co9S8/CoNSC shows outstanding anti-poisoning capability towards sulfur species during ORR catalysis with no obvious activity degradation observed in 0.1 M KOH containing 50 μM SO32− species, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C. The assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery using the Co9S8/CoNSC as a cathode shows a high power density (150 mW cm−2) and the assembled water electrolyzer only requires 1.585 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 when using this material as an anode and a cathode. This work provides an effective strategy to design and synthesize efficient, durable and anti-poisoning cobalt chalcogenide-based trifunctional electrocatalysts for the large-scale application of clean energy conversion devices.",Nanoscale
Function-directed design of battery separators based on microporous polyolefin membranes,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Separators in batteries have a great influence on their performance and safety, where both the properties of the separator and the separator-electrode interfaces affect ion diffusion. Microporous polyolefin membranes (MPM) with excellent properties are widely used as separators in commercial lithium batteries. However, MPM separators still suffer from serious thermal shrinkage and poor wettability, which lead to safety hazards and poor electrochemical performances. Furthermore, MPM separators cannot meet the higher requirements of next-generation high-energy-density batteries. With the fast progress in battery studies, researchers have gradually recognized that the separator is a favorable platform to address the key challenges of batteries. In this review, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art research on the function-directed design of MPM separators. Firstly, we briefly present the challenges associated with conventional MPM separators. Then, we summarize the methods for the preparation of MPM-based functional separators. Subsequently, we highlight the main functions of MPM separators including improving the wettability of liquid electrolytes, enhancing the thermal stability, inhibiting the shuttling of intermediate products and stabilizing metal anodes. Finally, we present a summary and future outlook of MPM-based functional separators. Insights from this review show that MPM-based functional separators can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance and safety of batteries. Also, the rational design of advanced separators will play an increasingly important role in the future development of next-generation high-energy-density batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
First principles study of layered silicon carbide as anode in lithium ion battery,"© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.In order to advance the current technology to cope with the future challenges, the search of anode materials beyond-graphite for use in lithium ion battery is in progress. First principles calculations were conducted to investigate the prospects of SiC layers as lithium intercalation compound. In order to investigate electrolyte decomposition triggered by high lithium reactivity in Li:SiC anode the molecular dynamics computations were performed. The simulations to model the electrode-electrolyte interface and temperature profiling were studied via reactive force field calculations that ruled out the reactivity at room temperature whereas uniform temperature afterwards sheds light on performance of the system. The diffusion coefficient of Li in layered SiC is calculated at different values of temperature. The ionic diffusion shown an activation energy of 0.046 eV whereas diffusion coefficient is found of the order 10−11 m2/s. The intercalation voltage calculated with grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation is found as 1.85 V. The ReaxFF simulations predicted that volume expansion in SiC layers appeared less than Si which shows the improved performance of the anode material.",International Journal of Quantum Chemistry
A family of superconducting boron crystals made of stacked bilayer borophenes,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Monolayer borophenes tend to be easily oxidized, while thicker borophenes have stronger antioxidation properties. Herein, we proposed four novel metallic boron crystals by stacking the experimentally synthesized borophenes, and one of the crystals has been reported in our previous experiments. Bilayer units tend to act as blocks for crystals as determined by bonding analyses. Their kinetic, thermodynamic and mechanical stabilities are confirmed by our calculated phonon spectra, molecular dynamics and elastic constants. Our proposed allotropes are more stable than the boron α-Ga phase below 1000 K at ambient pressure. Some of them become more stable than the α-rh or γ-B28 phases at appropriate external pressure. More importantly, our calculations show that three of the proposed crystals are phonon-mediated superconductors with critical temperatures of about 5-10 K, higher than those of most superconducting elemental solids, in contrast to typical boron crystals with significant band gaps. Our study indicates a novel preparation method for metallic and superconducting boron crystals dispensing with high pressure.",Nanoscale

Ferromagnetism of Mn-N4architecture embedded graphene,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.The realization of intrinsic two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials with high Curie temperature is one of the prevalent research directions in spintronics. Here, a 2D ferromagnet of Mn-N4 embedded graphene is reported, where the single Mn atom dispersed Mn-N4 structure is confirmed by extended X-ray absorption fine structure and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy results. Magnetic measurements demonstrate that the Mn-N4 embedded graphene exhibits robust room-temperature ferromagnetism, and the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism results reveal that the magnetic moments come from the embedded Mn atoms. Furthermore, using first-principle calculations, we demonstrate that the Mn-N4 architecture is the source of the magnetism and the long-range magnetic ordering is favored in such coordination systems.",Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics
Disordered Rock-Salt Type Li2 TiS3 as Novel Cathode for LIBs: A Computational Point of View,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The development of high-energy cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries with low content of critical raw materials, such as cobalt and nickel, plays a key role in the progress of lithium-ion batteries technology. In recent works, a novel and promising family of lithium-rich sulfides has received attention. Among the possible structures and arrangement, cubic disordered Li2 TiS3 has shown interesting properties, also for the formulation of new cell for all-solid-state batteries. In this work, a computational approach based on DFT hybrid Hamiltonian, localized basis functions and the use of the periodic CRYSTAL code, has been set up.

Furthermore, the correlation between structure and Raman fingerprint was established.",Nanomaterials
Enhancement of Electrochemical Performance of Selenium Cathode by Cobalt and Nitrogen Codoped Hollow Carbon Spheres 钴-氮共掺杂空心碳球提升硒正极电化学性能研究,"© 2022, Youke Publishing Co., Ltd. All right reserved.With the exhaustion of fossil energy and the increasingly severe environmental problems, it is urgent to change the energy structure from fossil energy to clean renewable energy. High performance and low-cost secondary batteries play an important role in modern new energy system. Lithium selenium (Li-Se) battery, as a representative of a new type of secondary battery, uses elemental selenium as the cathode material, with ultra-high volume specific capacity, which is of great practical significance for the development needs of mobile devices and electric vehicles where battery volume is strictly limited at present. However, the selenium cathode is still facing a series of problems. For examples, the bad conductivity of the selenium cathode, the great volume expansion during discharge process, and the serious ""shuttle phenomenon"" that caused by the active polyselenides dissolved in the ether-based electrolyte and so on. In order to solve the problems of poor electrical conductivity, short cycle life, poor rate performance and large amount of active material loss for traditional selenium-based cathode materials. A series of strategies have been developed by researchers, such as encapsulating the element sulfur into the carbon skeleton, inserting the interlayers, developing the binders, modifying the separators, optimizing the electrolyte as well as protecting the lithium anode. Inspired by the previous work, in this work, a novel cobalt and nitrogen-codoped with hollow carbon sphere (Co-N-C) was synthesized by using SiO2 nanospheres as template, N, N΄-disalicylaldehyde ethylenediamine cobalt as cobalt source, and dopamine hydrochloride as nitrogen source and carbon source. The obtained Co-N-C materials were conducted by a series of materials characterizations, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), N2 adsorption/desorption, in order to verify its structures and components. The characterization results proved that the cobalt and nitrogen were successfully doped in the skeleton of the materials and Co-N-C illustrated a hollow structure with a specific surface area of 843.75 m2·g-1 and high volume of 0.93 cm3·g-1. After encapsulating the element selenium into Co-N-C, the Co-N-C/Se composite positive electrode was synthesized. As expected, the synthesized Co-N-C/Se demonstrated enhanced electrochemical performances compared to the selenium cathode. At a charge and discharge current density of 0.5C, the specific capacity of Co-N-C/Se composite cathode could maintain a reversible capacity of 238 mAh·g-1 after 200 cycles, and the specific capacity could still keep as high as 222 mAh·g-1 at a high charge and discharge current density of 2.0C. However, the element selenium cathode only illustrated a reversible capacity of 62.1 mAh·g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.5C and it could only reach a specific capacity of 75.3 mAh·g-1 at 2.0C. Therefore, the Li-Se cells with high specific capacity, high-rate performance and long cycle life were successfully obtained through the synergistic action of conductive carbon skeleton, diversified chemisorption sites and catalytic active sites of the Co-N-C. This work provided a feasible technical path for the realization of higher specific energy density, longer cycle life selenium cathodes.",Xiyou Jinshu/Chinese Journal of Rare Metals
Review of defect engineering in perovskites for photovoltaic application,"© 2022 The Author(s).Perovskite-based devices have achieved high efficiencies in the fields of photovoltaics and energy storage. However, intrinsic defects in the deep levels of the perovskite structure are both morphological and structural. Perovskites mainly suffer from extrinsic defects at their interfaces and grain boundaries, ultimately affecting the perovskite film crystallinity. Moreover, they additionally depreciate the band alignment and charge transport. Defect engineering is therefore the ideal option to enhance device performance and stability. The initial substrate formation plays a consequential role in determining the morphology of the structure and different materials can thus be tested as precursors through different initial fabrication strategies to develop quality perovskite films. Composition engineering is also practiced, with dopants added at various levels of fabrication. In some cases, synthesizing defects also improves the device performance with reasonable stability. Herein, categorizing the defects, should be of primary importance given that defect structuring is very important to upgrade the perovskite performance for commercial applications.",Materials Advances
A comprehensive review of template-assisted porous carbons: Modern preparation methods and advanced applications,"© 2022 The AuthorsCarbons with hierarchical pores in the range of few nanometers obtained via template-assisted methods offer a great control over structure and geometry of pores, keeping them uniformly distributed and better connected. Another advantage is the easy functionalization of templated porous carbons (TPCs) by various dopants, which makes them excellent materials for catalysis, energy storage and conversion, sensors and environmental applications. Herein, beyond zeolite-templated carbons, key methodologies based on the template material such as organic and metal oxides, silica, polymers, metal-organic framework (MOFs) and bio-originated materials used for the preparation of porous carbons possessing predetermined structure and composition, have been reviewed. The effects of precursor material on the textural and structural properties of TPCs have been described. In scope of applying novel methods such as evaporation induced self-assembling (EISA), the influence of different templates on the properties of resulting materials has been discussed. Further, advances on the template-induced synthesis of self-supporting metal-organic frameworks and their utilization as advanced templates have been described. Moreover, self-templates are especially emphasized, application of which in our opinion can provide a sustainable large-scale production of TPCs. The recent progress in the study of the diffusional processes, energy and biomedical applications as well as the confinement effects of different liquids and proteins within the porous matrices of template-derived carbons, have been reviewed.",Materials Science and Engineering R: Reports

ZIF-67-based catalysts in persulfate advanced oxidation processes (PS-AOPs) for water remediation,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.Zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), which consists of metal ions Co2+ and 2-methylimidazole ligand, is a kind of typical MOF material.

Cation-doped ZnS catalysts for polysulfide conversion in lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.Catalytic conversion of polysulfides is regarded as a crucial approach to enhancing kinetics and suppressing the shuttle effect in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. However, the activity prediction of Li–S catalysts remains elusive owing to the lack of mechanistic understanding of activity descriptors. Here, we report a volcano-shaped relationship between polysulfide adsorption ability and catalytic activity. In conjunction with theoretical analysis, we distinguish catalytic and anchoring effects to delineate the role of adsorption and emphasize the passivation of catalysts. These findings enable us to develop a composite catalyst, Co0.125Zn0.875S, which shows higher performance than simple binary compounds. Such a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic link between polysulfide adsorption and catalytic activity offers a rational viewpoint for designing Li–S catalysts and tuning their activities.

Atomically Dispersed Manganese Lewis Acid Sites Catalyze Electrohydrogenation of Nitrogen to Ammonia,"© 2022 CCS Chemistry. All rights reserved.Ambient electrochemical nitrogen fixation is a promising and environmentally benign route for producing sustainable ammonia, but has been limited by the poor performance of existing catalysts that promote the balanced chemisorption of N2 and subsequent electrochemical activation and hydrogenation. Herein, we describe the highly selective and efficient electrohydrogenation of nitrogen to ammonia using a hollow nanorod-based hierarchically graphitic carbon electrocatalyst with abundant atomically dispersed Mn sites. We discovered that the electron interactions strengthen the interfacial binding between nitrogen and active Mn Lewis acidic hotspots. The Lewis acid–base interactions promote the chemisorption and lock up nitrogen on the active sites and suppress proton adsorption. The proton-coupled electron transfer cleavage of the nitrogen triple bond through an associative mechanism was confirmed under lower overpotential, which delivered high ammonia yield of 67.5 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and Faradaic efficiency of 13.7% at −0.25 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, along with ∼100% selectivity and significantly enhanced electrochemical stability (about 88.8% current retention over 50 h potentiostatic test) under mild conditions. Our strategy is versatile to tailor the nitrogen fixation performance of single-atom catalysts with atomic accuracy.",CCS Chemistry
Reconstruction of Electronic Structure of MOF-525 via Metalloporphyrin for Enhanced Photoelectro-Fenton Process,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) process can continuously promote the occurrence of Fenton reaction and the generation of active species, which is an advanced oxidation technology for pollutant degradation. However, the lack of bifunctional catalysts restricts the development of PEF technology. In this study, the electronic rearrangement MOF-525 modified by metalloporphyrin (named MOF-525-Fe/Zr) was prepared, to load on the carbon felt as a novel cathode catalyst, which is used in PEF process. A series of characterization and photoelectric chemical properties tests combined with DFT calculation showed that the modification of MOF-525 could not only have the large specific surface area and multistage pore structure but also co-stimulate the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and ligand-to-cluster charge transfer (LCCT) by photoelectric synergy. These charge transitions provide periodic electron donor-acceptor conduction paths in MOF-525-Fe/Zr, which can improve the active species formation and transfer efficiency. Owing to their favorable pore and electronic structure as well as stability, MOF-525-Fe/Zr shows great promise for the application in the catalytic process of PEF. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation was enhanced by MOF-525-Fe/Zr with the TOC removal rate above 75% both in river water and tap water. Finally, the reasonable pathway of PEF catalytic degradation of SMX was proposed by HPLC-MS analysis. In conclusion, this study provides a new idea for reconstructing the electronic structure of MOFs catalyst and broadening the practical application of PEF technology.",Catalysts
Graphite felt modified by nanoporous carbon as a novel cathode material for the EF process,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryNanoporous carbon (NPC) with microporous, mesoporous, and macroporous composite structures was designed and a new electro-Fenton cathode material was prepared by loading NPC onto graphite felt (GF) in this paper. The surface morphology and electrochemical properties of this material have been analyzed. The results show that the NPC obtained by carbonizing the composite of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and zeolite imidazole skeleton-8 has rich porosity and large specific surface area, which promotes the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction. Compared with the original GF, the NPC/GF electrode loaded with NPC has a higher current response and a lower charge transfer resistance. This modification has significantly improved the performance of the cathode to produce H2O2. Under the optimum conditions, the H2O2 yield of the NPC/GF electrode is about 17 times higher than that of the original GF and the degradation rate of acid red 18 (AR 18, 100 mg L−1) can reach 98.18% within 2 hours. After eight cycles, the H2O2 output of the NPC/GF cathode did not decrease significantly and the degradation rate of AR18 was still higher than 95%, indicating that the NPC/GF electrode has good reusability and certain practical value.",New Journal of Chemistry
Potassium gluconate-cooperative pore generation based on g-C3N4nanosheets for highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production and antibiotic degradation,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) photocatalysts are used to achieve photocatalytic activity under visible light, but they suffer from an unprecedented bottleneck period. These photocatalysts have many intrinsic shortcomings, such as their small specific surface area and inefficient separation rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Therefore, changing the morphology and structure of g-C3N4 are essential challenges in addressing these shortcomings. Herein, we propose a novel one-pot method for constructing porous ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets. Melamine and potassium gluconate were effectively combined via a supramolecular assembly strategy. As a gas template, potassium gluconate decomposes to produce CO2 at high temperature. This novel potassium gluconate-cooperative pore generation on g-C3N4 nanosheets method is proposed for the first time. As a result, the PCN-1.4 (the optimum sample of porous ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets) photocatalyst has a large surface and a porous layer structure (67.95 m2 g-1, 0.3594 cm3 g-1) with abundant nitrogen defects. Furthermore, the porous ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets prepared by this method not only have good performance in hydrogen production, but also in TC degradation. On the one hand, the PCN-1.4 sample exhibits an excellent hydrogen production efficiency (2323 μmol.g-1 h-1) that is 12 times that of bulk g-C3N4 (192 μmol g-1 h-1). On the other hand, compared to the tetracycline hydrochloride degradation efficiency of bulk g-C3N4 of 22 %, PCN-1.4 exhibits a higher degradation rate as high as 83 %. In summary, a new pathway for the generative pore-making is provided to prepare other porous materials.",Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering
Electrolyte Solvation and Ionic Association: Reassessing Raman Spectroscopic Studies of Ion Coordination for LiTFS,"© 2022 The Electrochemical Society (“ECS”). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.Raman spectroscopy is widely used to evaluate the ionic interactions and solvates present in electrolytes. As shown here, however, Raman spectra for crystalline solvates containing the lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (or amide) (i.e., LiN(SO2CF3)2, LiTFSI, LiTFSA, LiNTf2 or LiTf2N) salt indicate that the commonly used vibrational band analyses are likely to be inaccurate and thus result in misleading conclusions about the ion interactions in liquid electrolytes with this salt. In particular, it is found by examining the Raman spectrum of a known crystalline solvate with the CIP-I-C 2 coordination mode (i.e., a TFSI− anion with a C 2 conformation coordinated to a single Li+ cation via a single oxygen atom), that the vibrational band for this mode of coordination overlaps (or is closely positioned beside) that for the uncoordinated (i.e., SSIP) TFSI− anion. This realization further complicates the assessment of Raman data for LiTFSI-based electrolytes.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
Carbon Tube-Based Cathode for Li-CO2 Batteries: A Review,"© 2022 by the authors.

A multifunctional separator modified using Y2O3/Co3O4 heterostructures boosting polysulfide catalytic conversion for advanced Li-S batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LiSBs) have attracted extensive attention due to their low cost and high theoretical energy density (2600 W h kg−1). However, the commercial application of Li-S batteries is seriously hindered by the shuttle effect and sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfides. To address the above problems, brand-new Y2O3/Co3O4 heterostructures were prepared and designed by a simple hydrothermal method and calcination process as a modified separator material (Y2O3/Co3O4/AB) for Li-S batteries. Moreover, the capsule-like Y2O3/Co3O4 heterostructures can trap polysulfides and catalytically convert them, originating from strong synergistic adsorption of transition metal oxides and the high-efficiency catalysis of rare-earth oxides. Herein, due to these merits, the battery with the Y2O3/Co3O4/AB modified separator exhibits a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1204 mA h g−1 and a high capacity retention of 92% after 100 cycles at 0.2C. Even at a high current density of 3C, the specific capacity can achieve 659 mA h g−1. Therefore, this work provides a promising strategy for mitigating the shuttle effect of polysulfides and lays a solid foundation for further practical application of LiSBs.",Sustainable Energy and Fuels

Molecular Modeling in Anion Exchange Membrane Research: A Brief Review of Recent Applications,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM) fuel cells have attracted growing interest, due to their encouraging advantages, including high power density and relatively low cost. AEM is a polymer matrix, which conducts hydroxide (OH−) ions, prevents physical contact of electrodes, and has positively charged head groups (mainly quaternary ammonium (QA) groups), covalently bound to the polymer backbone. The chemical instability of the quaternary ammonium (QA)-based head groups, at alkaline pH and elevated temperature, is a significant threshold in AEMFC technology. This review work aims to introduce recent studies on the chemical stability of various QA-based head groups and transportation of OH− ions in AEMFC, via modeling and simulation techniques, at different scales. It starts by introducing the fundamental theories behind AEM-based fuel-cell technology. In the main body of this review, we present selected computational studies that deal with the effects of various parameters on AEMs, via a variety of multi-length and multi-time-scale modeling and simulation methods. Such methods include electronic structure calculations via the quantum Density Functional Theory (DFT), ab initio, classical all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, and coarse-grained MD simulations. The explored processing and structural parameters include temperature, hydration levels, several QA-based head groups, various types of QA-based head groups and backbones, etc. Nowadays, many methods and software packages for molecular and materials modeling are available. Applications of such methods may help to understand the transportation mechanisms of OH− ions, the chemical stability of functional head groups, and many other relevant properties, leading to a performance-based molecular and structure design as well as, ultimately, improved AEM-based fuel cell performances. This contribution aims to introduce those molecular modeling methods and their recent applications to the AEM-based fuel cells research community.",Molecules

Carbon-coated MoSe2/MXene heterostructures as active materials for high-performance Na+ batteries,"© 2022Despiting the technological promise and environmental friendliness of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), relatively large sizes of Na-ions and moderate oxidation-reduction response slows down their wider-spread industrial implementation. To overcome this obstacle, we developed carbon-coated MoSe2/MXene heterostructures, in which MXene was covered on the MoSe2 particles and the loose carbon linked all the coated particles while providing porosity. The density-functional theory was used to understand the electronic structure of the carbon-coated MoSe2/MXene (MoSe2/Mo2CTx/C) and the mechanism of exchanging charge between MoSe2 and MXene. MoSe2/Mo2CTx/C as active anode material showed exceptional stability even after 2200 cycles in SIBs. Specifically, the capacities and retention rates observed for the batteries containing MoSe2/Mo2CTx/C and cycled at 0.5, 1, and 2 A g−1 rates were equal to 652.2, 484.4, and 238.4 mAh g−1 and 102.5%, 103.9%, and 86.3%, respectively. Thus, carbon-coated MoSe2/MXene can be utilized as active SIB anode materials.",Materials Today Communications

Insights into nitrogen doped sulfur-existed carbonaceous material toward acetaminophen removal by peroxymonosulfate activation,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.Heteroatom doping into the carbon matrix has been widely accepted to overcome the electronic inertness of carbonaceous material. In this study, N was doped into carbonaceous material within S to evaluate the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation performance of the obtained carbocatalyst for the degradation of acetaminophen (ACE). The results demonstrated that individually N or S doped carbocatalysts could activate PMS, but only N doping exhibit significant PMS activation performance. More interestingly, simultaneously co-existed of N and S exhibited obviously lower PMS activation performance than individual N doping. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation exhibited that N doped carbon matrix possessed more positive surface electrostatic potential than N and S co-doped carbocatalyst, amongst S exhibited opposite electronic structure regulation compared with N. Therefore, the PMS activation performance of N doped carbon was significantly higher than that by N and S co-existed carbon. SO4-, HO,1O2 and O2- was involved in the reaction, the result shown that singlet oxygen amplified the non-radical mechanism and the electron transfer from adsorbed organic pollutant to adsorbed PMS was the another dominated pathway to the ACE degradation. Further experiments unraveled that higher PMS concentration, catalysts dosage, and lower initial solution pH would facilitate the PMS activation process.",Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering

In-situ growth of N@MoO2microflowers on carbon cloth for high-performance anodes in microbial fuel cells,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.Anode is a crucial component enabling microbial fuel cells (MFCs) to achieve efficient and durable power generation; however, the preparation of high-performance and up-scaling anodes via facile methods remains a practical challenge. In this study, a nitrogen-doped carbon cloth grafted with molybdenum dioxide microspheres (N @ MoO2/CC) was fabricated using a facile two-step method: in situ polymerization and high-temperature carburization. N @ MoO2/CC exhibited excellent bioelectricity harvesting capacity owing to its dual function of promoting bacterial colonization while enriching electroactive bacteria. The synergy of N-doping and MoO2-grafting enabled the development of a biocompatible interface for bacterial adhesion, resulting in a high bacterial loading capacity. Furthermore, N-doping and MoO2-grafting modifications facilitated the enrichment of Geobacter, thereby enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode. MFC equipped with N @ MoO2/CC achieved a maximum power density of 3.01 ± 0.23 W·m-2, i.e., 1.43 times the power density achieved using a pristine carbon cloth (2.10 ± 0.04 W·m-2). Additionally, the physical and electrochemical characterizations confirmed that the as-prepared N @ MoO2/CC exhibited excellent operational stability. In summary, N @ MoO2/CC could significantly enhance bacterial colonization, enable electroactive bacteria to flourish, and boost charge transfer efficiency at the microbe-electrode interface, thus improving the electricity generation in MFCs.",Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering
Adsorption-Catalysis-Conversion of Polysulfides in Sandwiched Ultrathin Ni(OH)2-PANI for Stable Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Strong adsorption and catalysis for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are critical toward the electrochemical stability of Li-S batteries. Herein, a hollow sandwiched nanoparticle is put forward to enhance the adsorption-catalysis-conversion dynamic of sulfur species. The outer ultrathin Ni(OH)2 nanosheets not only confine LiPSs via both physical encapsulation and chemical adsorption, but also promote redox kinetics and accelerate the conversion of sulfur species, which is revealed by experiments and theoretical calculations. Meanwhile, the inner hollow polyaniline soft core provides a strong chemical bonding to LiPSs after vulcanization, which can chemically adsorpt LiPSs, and synergistically confine the shuttle effect. Moreover, the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets with a large specific area can enhance the wettability of electrolyte, and the flexible hollow sandwiched structure can accommodate the volume expansion, promoting sulfur utilization and structural stability. The obtained cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with an initial discharge capacity of 1173 mAh g–1 and a small capacity decay of 0.08% per cycle even after 500 cycles at 0.2 C, among the best results of Ni(OH)2-based materials for Li–S batteries.

Methods: Fe3C nanoparticles confined in N-doped carbons (Fe3C/NC) were prepared using Fe3+ coordinated N-bearing ionic liquids as precursors and melamine as nitrogen source and template, followed by pyrolysis at 900 °C under N2 atmosphere. The physicochemical properties of the as-prepared Fe3C/NC catalyst were analyzed by FT-IR, TG, BET, TEM, XRD, Raman and XPS, respectively, and further employed as novel heterogeneous catalyst for selective oxidation of styrene into benzaldehyde with molecular oxygen. Significant findings: The results showed that the Fe3C nanoparticles were formed and uniformly embedded into the N-doped carbon matrix, which were confirmed to be the active sites for styrene oxidation. Moreover, the 5 % Fe3C/NC catalyst possessed high surface area and dominant mesoporous structure, which could expose more accessible active sites and facilitate mass transfer. As a result, the 5 % Fe3C/NC catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performance for styrene oxidation into benzaldehyde with the appropriate styrene conversion of 58.8 % and selectivity to benzaldehyde of 64.1 % as well as no significant activity and selectivity loss after reused at least five times.",Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers
Amino Termination of Ti3C2 MXene Induces its Graphene Hybridized Film with Enhanced Ordered Nanostructure and Excellent Multiperformance,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The strategy of nacre-inspired structures or the introduction of polymers can only strengthen and toughen 2D inorganic nanosheets-based flexible films while mitigating their other properties. Herein, based on bending rigidity discrepancy of reduced graphene oxides (rGO) and Ti3C2 nanosheets, the introduction of amino termination on Ti3C2 (Ti3C2-NH2) endows 3rGO/7Ti3C2-NH2 films with enhanced ordered nanostructure and excellent multiperformance. Its interlayer-ordered nanostructures are consistently confirmed by both wide-angle X-ray scattering and polarized Raman spectroscopy. The tensile strength and fracture energy increase by 84.7% and 156.3% compared with those of traditional 3rGO/7Ti3C2 film, respectively. The higher remained stress (81%) after relaxation agrees well with its better nanosheet orientation. The average fatigue cycles to failure approach 16 951 times under 150 MPa maximum tensile loading. Due to a large decrease in the interface thermal resistance, its thermal conductivity approaches ≈48.9 W m−1 K−1. The results also show that the absorbance of Ti3C2-NH2 based films greatly surpass the maximum of the components in both X-band frequency and middle infrared range. Particularly, 3rGO/7Ti3C2-NH2 films exhibit anomalously high absorbance in the middle infrared range (55% for 22 µm thickness). It suggests that this film has good promise as flexible electronic devices with excellent mechanical, EMI shielding, heat dissipation, and thermal accumulation monitoring capabilities.",Advanced Materials Interfaces

Balancing Electrolyte Donicity and Cathode Adsorption Capacity for High-Performance Li-S Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Li-S batteries with high theoretical capacity are attracting attention as next-generation energy storage systems. Much effort has been devoted to the introduction of cathode materials with strong adsorption to sulfide species, but it is presented that this selection should be refined in the application of high donicity electrolytes. The oxides with different adsorption capacities are explored while controlling the electrolyte donicity, confirming the trade-off effect between the donicity and the adsorption capacity for sulfur conversion. Specifically, a cathode substrate containing oxide nanoparticles of MgO, NiO, Fe2O3, Co3O4, and V2O5 is prepared with spectra in adsorption capacity as well as low and high donicity electrolytes by controlling the concentration of LiNO3 salt. Strong adsorbent oxides such as Co3O4 and V2O5 cause competitive adsorption of electrolyte salts in high donicity electrolytes, resulting in poor cell performance. High cell performance is achieved on weakly adsorbing oxides of MgO or NiO with high donicity electrolytes; the MgO-containing cathode cell delivers a high discharge capacity of 1394 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C.

In-Plane Mott–Schottky Effects Enabling Efficient Hydrogen Evolution from Mo5N6-MoS2 Heterojunction Nanosheets in Universal-pH Electrolytes,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Cost-effective electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) spanning a wide pH range are highly desirable but still challenging for hydrogen production via electrochemical water splitting. Herein, Mo5N6-MoS2 heterojunction nanosheets prepared on hollow carbon nanoribbons (Mo5N6-MoS2/HCNRs) are designed as Mott–Schottky electrocatalysts for efficient pH-universal HER. The in-plane Mo5N6-MoS2 Mott–Schottky heterointerface induces electron redistribution and a built-in electric field, which effectively activates the inert MoS2 basal planes to intrinsically increase the electrocatalytic activity, improve electronic conductivity, and boost water dissociation activity. Moreover, the vertical Mo5N6-MoS2 nanosheets provide more activated sites for the electrochemical reaction and facilitate mass/electrolyte transport, while the tightly coupled HCNRs substrate and metallic Mo5N6 provide fast electron transfer paths. Consequently, the Mo5N6-MoS2/HCNRs electrocatalyst delivers excellent pH-universal HER performances exemplified by ultralow overpotentials of 57, 59, and 53 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes with Tafel slopes of 38.4, 43.5, and 37.9 mV dec−1, respectively, which are superior to those of the reported MoS2-based catalysts and outperform Pt in overall water splitting.

Doping-Induced Electronic/Ionic Engineering to Optimize the Redox Kinetics for Potassium Storage: A Case Study of Ni-Doped CoSe2,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Heteroatom doping effectively tunes the electronic conductivity of transition metal selenides (TMSs) with rapid K+ accessibility in potassium ion batteries (PIBs). Although considerable efforts are dedicated to investigating the relationship between the doping strategy and the resulting electrochemistry, the doping mechanisms, especially in view of the ion and electronic diffusion kinetics upon cycling, are seldom elucidated systematically. Herein, the crystal structure stability, charge/ion state, and bandgap of the active materials are found to be precisely modulated by favorable heteroatom doping, resulting in intrinsically fast kinetics of the electrode materials. Based on the combined mechanisms of intercalation and conversion reactions, electron and K+ ion transfer in Ni-doped CoSe2 embedded in carbon nanocomposites (Ni-CoSe2@NC) can be significantly enhanced via electronic engineering. Benefiting from the synthetic controlled Ni grains, the heterointerface formed by the intermediate products of electrochemical reactions in Ni-CoSe2@NC strengthens the conversion kinetics and interdiffusion process, developing a low-barrier mesophase with optimized potassium storage.

Hence, this paper synthesizes nitrogen and sulfur co-doped three-dimensional magnesium lignosulfonate (MLS-derived) flower-like hierarchical porous carbon (NSLPC) materials by a simple and green method. The synthesized NSLPC uses magnesium lignosulfonate as the sulfur source and carbon precursor, melamine as nitrogen source, MgO as hard template, and ZnCl2 as the activator.

Constructing Atomic Fe and N Co-doped Hollow Carbon Nanospheres with a Polymer Encapsulation Strategy for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries with Accelerated Polysulfide Conversion,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.As competitive next-generation rechargeable batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) suffer from the shuttle effect and the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides during charge and discharge processes, adversely affecting their electrochemical performances and actual applications. Herein, we demonstrate a polymer encapsulation strategy to synthesize atomic Fe and N co-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe−NHC) with Fe−Nx sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Benefiting from the excellent structural design, the doped-N with positive charges could effectively adsorb negatively charged soluble polysulfides, help attract the soluble polysulfides to the Fe atoms and boost the catalytic transformation of the soluble polysulfides. Additionally, such a thin carbon shell could provide a short mass diffusion pathway and hence promote the adsorption and the catalytic conversion. Therefore, the battery with the Fe−NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. At the large current density of 1 C, the specific capacity is 1079 mA h g−1 and maintains a low loss of 0.076 % per cycle within 500 cycles. Even at a harsh current density of 4 C, a high capacity of 824 mA h g−1 is still achieved, indicating the advantage of the Fe−NHC/PP separator in LSBs.",Chemistry - A European Journal
In situ enhance lithium polysulfides redox kinetics by carbon cloth/MoO3 self-standing electrode for lithium–sulfur battery,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Lithium-sulfur battery is expected to be the new generation of high-performance electrochemical storage system benefiting from its high energy density and low cost. However, the slow redox kinetics caused by the low conductivity of sulfur and the shuttle effect result from lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) limit its practical utility. In this work, a highly efficient strategy of freestanding carbon cloth supported molybdenum oxide (CC/MoO3) with in situ deposition of Li2S8 as an active matrix is designed. This chemistry enables strong affinity of Li2S8 on CC/MoO3 electrode, meanwhile, the strong polarity of MoO3 catalyzes the mutual transformation of LiPSs and inhibits the shuttle of liquid LiPSs. With the above superiorities, the CC/MoO3@Li2S8 electrode shows impressive electrochemical performance, with a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1274 mAh g−1 at a rate of 0.1 C with the sulfur loading of 2 mg cm−2, and a capacity retention rate of 93.1% compared to the initial stable specific capacity. Even with a high sulfur loading of 4 mg cm−2, it still maintains high electrochemical activity with a high reversible specific capacity of 916 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. Those results show that coupling polar metal oxide material with flexible conductive carbon cloth provides a highly efficient catalytic/conductive network to accelerate sulfur utilization and stability.

Ten micrometer thick polyethylene separator modified by α-LiAlO2@γ-Al2O3 nanosheets for simultaneous suppression of Li dendrite growth and polysulfide shuttling in Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are of considerable interest for low-cost and high-density energy storage. However, the notorious polysulfide shuttling and the undesired Li dendrite growth impel the development of Li-S batteries. To simultaneously mitigate these problems, a thin (∼10 μm) separator is herein developed by coating α-LiAlO2@γ-Al2O3 (LAO) nanosheets on the dual sides of a commercial polyethylene (PE) separator. Owing to the high anion-anchoring capability and the polysulfide absorbing and catalytic effect of LAO, the LAO modified separator (LAOMS) not only suppresses the polysulfide shuttling, but also homogenizes Li+ flux and reduces concentration polarization. As a result, the Li-Li cell with LAOMS demonstrates an unprecedented stability over 2500 h when cycled at a high current density of 5 mA/cm2. In addition, the Li-S battery with LAOMS exhibits superior cycling lifespan with an ultra-low capacity decay of 0.037% per cycle over 1000 cycles even at 2 C, excellent rate performance, and superior anti-self-discharge capability. Our studies not only shed light on the rational design of functionalized separators for high-performance Li-S batteries, but also provide a thin separator with promising commercial perspective.",Materials Today Energy

Investigation into the morphological implications on electron transfer dynamics of lithium peroxides by scanning electrochemical microscopy,"© 2022 Korean Chemical Society, Seoul & Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium–air batteries are highlighted as one of promising next generation battery technology with high gravimetric energy density. To date, however, cyclability of lithium–air batteries has been low, insufficient for commercial use. Many recent research accounts focused on understanding the mechanism of the discharge reaction in attempts to improve the cyclability, and revealed that two structurally distinct lithium peroxide species form during discharge, thin films and toroids, among which toroids formation results in beneficial effects in both cyclability and overall discharge capacity. In this work, scanning electrochemical microscopy was applied to investigate electron transfer dynamics of the two lithium peroxide species, from which a much faster surface electron transfer was observed from lithium peroxide toroids compared to that of thin films. The difference is postulated to stem from the difference in the formation mechanism of the two species.",Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society

Ni-CeO2 Heterostructures in Li-S Batteries: A Balancing Act between Adsorption and Catalytic Conversion of Polysulfide,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have attracted considerable attention over the last two decades because of a high energy density and low cost. However, the wide application of Li–S batteries has been severely impeded due to the poor electrical conductivity of S, shuttling effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and sluggish redox kinetics of S species, especially under high S loading. To address all these issues, a Ni–CeO2 heterostructure-doped carbon nanofiber (Ni-CeO2-CNF) is developed as an S host that combines the strong adsorption with the high catalytic activity and the good electrical conductivity, where the LiPSs anchored on the heterostructure surface can directly gain electrons from the current collector and realize a fast conversion between S8 and Li2S. Therefore, Li–S batteries with S@Ni-CeO2-CNF cathodes exhibit superior long-term cycling stability, with a capacity decay of 0.046% per cycle over 1000 cycles, even at 2 C. Noteworthy, under a sulfur loading up to 6 mg cm−2, a high reversible areal capacity of 5.3 mAh cm−2 can be achieved after 50 cycles at 0.1 C. The heterostructure-modified S cathode effectively reconciles the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of LiPSs for adsorption and conversion, furthering the development of high-performance Li–S batteries.",Advanced Science

Three-dimensional printing of the copper sulfate hybrid composites for supercapacitor electrodes with ultra-high areal and volumetric capacitances,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.How to prepare electrodes with high areal and volumetric capacitance is very significant for the daily use of supercapacitors. The booming additive manufacturing technology is well suited to this task. However, the selection of materials for 3D printing electrodes is still the focus of research. In this study, 2D layered graphene oxide (GO) was used as the binder and two kinds of 1D nanomaterials including MWCNTs and KCu7S4 were used as conductive and skeleton materials to prepare ink with excellent rheological properties through simple vacuum stirring. The electrodes were prepared by direct ink writing (DIW) printing, freeze drying, and simple chemical reduction. Herein, the 3D printed rGO/MWCNTs/KCu7S4 electrode has a special conductive cross-linking structure formed by self-combination. Among them, the 8-layer electrode at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 shows a gravimetric capacitance of 1674.3 F g−1, corresponding to the areal and volumetric capacitance of 27.8 F cm−2 and 73.1 F cm−3, respectively. This electrode has excellent capacitance retention, which could be achieved at 88.6% after 2000 successive cycles at 2 A g−1. Our work provides a simple and effective approach for the application of copper sulfate materials in DIW printing, and lays a good foundation for future application in supercapacitors and other electrochemical energy storage devices.

Here, it is shown that Tremella fuciformis (Tfu), possessing an abundant porous structure and favorable metal affinity, is favorably serves as a precursor for confining uniform metal nanoparticles, by comparing the chemical characteristics of six varieties of agarics. The modest size of Co in the Tfu derived composite, Co@NPC-Tfu (NPC = N, P co-doped carbon), is suitable for in situ semi-oxidation during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), forming a stable core-shell structure of Co3O4@Co. Thus, Co@NPC-Tfu can be used as a state-of-the-art electrocatalyst for OER with an overpotential of 213.6 ± 4.1 mV at 10 mA cm−2, and a significant turnover frequency of 3.21 s−1 at 300 mV, benefitting from the optimum trade-off between the atom utilization and electrical conductivity. Operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations unveil the occupied state modulation of the robust carbon-bonded POx groups, which optimizes the intermediate adsorption to accelerate OER kinetics. Moreover, Tfu derived Ni@NPC-Tfu can be also prepared as a high-performance hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst, which can be utilized for efficient overall water splitting coupled with Co@NPC-Tfu.",Advanced Functional Materials
Chemical vapor deposition of guest-host dual metal-organic framework heterosystems for high-performance mixed matrix membranes,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdDesigning metal-organic framework (MOF) architectures and regulating their porous microenvironments are of greatly scientific interests. In this study, we report a kind of guest-host dual MOF@MOF heterosystems with guest MOF cells in other host MOF cavities, and construct them by vapor linker processing. Thanks to the simplified mass transfer process from solvent-free chemical vapor deposition, the pre-impregnated metal precursors in confined MOF pores can be in situ bridged by linkers to form MOF cages with well porosity. These heterosystems exhibit tailored dual pore geometries, enhanced affinities to gas molecules, and combined advantages of different MOFs. We further demonstrate that the MOF@MOF composites have substantially improved compatibility toward polymers and can serve as molecular sieving to adjust membrane transport pathways for achieving outstanding carbon capture performance, with 162% CO2 permeability (14,366 Barrer, 1 Barrer=10−10 cm3 cm cm−2 s−1 cmHg−1) and 152% CO2/N2 selectivity as that of pure polymeric membranes.

Boosting capacitive performance of nitrogen-doped carbon by atomically dispersed iron,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Carbon-based electrochemical capacitors are important energy storage devices owing to their high power and long life. However, their practical implementation has been restrained by low energy as a result of the limitation of double-layer capacitance. In this work, we demonstrate that the incorporation of atomically dispersed Fe into nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe−NC) can drastically boost the double-layer capacitance of carbon materials. Electrochemical tests reveal that an enhancement in the capacitance from 147.5 F g−1 to 174.8 F g−1 is realized when single Fe atoms are incorporated into nitrogen-doped carbon. In addition, symmetric supercapacitors based on Fe−NC exhibit a robust cycling performance, retaining 94.7% of the capacitance over 100,000 cycles. This improvement can be correlated to the chemical coordination of iron with adjacent nitrogen atoms to tailor the electric structure of carbon, which increases the density of states near the Fermi level and improves anion adsorption on atomic Fe sites. The single-atom engineering strategy may offer new possibilities to develop high-performance carbon materials for capacitors.",Journal of Power Sources
Interface-Adaptive Binder Enabled by Supramolecular Interactions for High-Capacity Si/C Composite Anodes in Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Although Si and graphite (Si/C) composite materials are among the most promising alternative to graphite anode in commercial batteries because of high capacity, the issue of the poor structural and interfacial stability of the composite electrode is extremely challenging. Herein, an interface-adaptive triblock polymer binder that can interact Si and graphite particles to improve the particle affinity and binder spreadability via the supramolecular interactions of π∙∙∙π stacking and hydrogen bonding is presented. The strategy of enhancing the interfacial interactions can further effectively stabilize the electrode interface and minimize the electrode/electrolyte side reactions. Benefiting from this proposed binder, the Si/C anode retains a high reversible capacity (82.1%) after 400 cycles and delivers improved cycling stability even at high areal capacity (4 mAh cm−2, 0.067% capacity loss/cycle) and in Si/C|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell (0.22% capacity loss/cycle). This design strategy for the binder provides a novel path toward high-energy, long-cycling Si/C anodes.",Advanced Functional Materials
Effective design and synthesis of donor-acceptor covalent triazine polymers with boosted photocatalytic performance for Cr(VI) reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Two new donor–acceptor covalent triazine polymers (CTPs), namely Th-Trz (JOU-6) and Th-Ph-Trz (JOU-7), containing electron-donating thieno[2,3-b]thiophene (Th) units and electron-withdrawing triazine (Trz) units have been successfully constructed (Ph = benzene ring). The unique conjugated structure of the CTPs invokes wide absorption range and high charge transfer efficiency. Because of these advantages, the as-prepared CTPs are highly effective photocatalysts for Cr(VI) reduction. It is found that high acid concentration in the photocatalytic system may assist the protonation of triazine groups in CTPs, which not only can enhance their adsorption ability for Cr2O72−, but also can promote their charge transfer ability. Another important finding is that compared with JOU-6, JOU-7 shows more efficient charge separation owing to the introduction of benzene ring between the donor and acceptor units, inducing a spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and thereby giving a better photocatalytic performance. The spatial charge distribution of the CTPs was also investigated by theoretical calculation based on molecular orbital theory. Fascinatingly, Cr(VI) and organic pollutions can be simultaneously removed by JOU-7 without any sacrificial agents, oxidizer, or acid. This work provides a valuable strategy for the design and construction of effective photocatalysts for the removal of pollutants in wastewater.",Separation and Purification Technology
Bifunctional TiN@N-doped-graphene catalyst based high sulfur content cathode for reversible Aluminum-Sulfur batteries,"© 2022Aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) batteries are drawing extensive attentions for the development of economical battery systems owing to the high theoretical capacity of 1672 mAh g−1 and low-cost naturally abundant electrode materials, Al and S. However, Al-S batteries are beset by poor reversibility and low actual capacity, only few reversible Al-S cells have been reported until now. In this work, factors affecting Al–S batteries performance are explored and explained, such as the inactive discharge product(Al2S3), polysulfides diffusion and the self-discharge reaction on the surface of SEI-layer-free aluminum anode. And we demonstrate an improved Al–S battery by effectively adjust the voltage window and develop TiN@N-doped-graphene catalyst materials to modify the sulfur cathode. This catalyst is for the first time applied in Al–S batteries and explored its positive effects during the reversible Al-S reactions. Comprehensive electrochemical testing and ex-situ characterization certificates that, in the discharging process, the shuttle effect of polysulfides is suppressed based on the strong adsorption of catalyst; in the charging process, sulfide redox kinetics are promoted and the decomposition reaction barrier is reduced by the catalyst. The Al-S cell delivers an initial capacity of ∼993 mAh g−1 and maintains a capacity of ∼500 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles.",Energy Storage Materials
Rationally designed alloy phases for highly reversible alkali metal batteries,"© 2022Alkali metal batteries (AMBs) have been recognized one of the most promising battery systems owing to the remarkable theoretical capacities and low redox potentials of alkali metals, enabling a high energy density of over 500 Wh kg−1. However, the problematic dendrite growth and huge volume variation during the iterative plating/stripping processes lead to inferior Coulombic efficiency, short lifespan, and even safety issues.

Commercial carbon cloth: An emerging substrate for practical lithium metal batteries,"© 2022Lithium metal anode is regarded as a key part of the next generation battery owing to its high specific energy density and low electrode potential. However, the easily produced lithium dendrite becomes a bottleneck hindering the practical application. Various solutions have been developed to alleviate the above issue, of which introducing carbon-based substrates with a high conductivity has been enormously reported as an effective strategy for regulating the lithium deposition. Meantime, commercial carbon fiber cloth with merits of 3D structure, good flexibility, good electrical conductivity, cheap and self-standing feature is emerging as an ideal choice for practical lithium metal batteries. However, the reviews and perspectives over the lipophilicity modification of carbon cloth-based substrates for advanced lithium metal batteries are still absent. Therefore, we propose this review for summarizing the progress on CC based lithium metal batteries and addressing the perspectives in the near future. In this review, we present three aspects based on the different mechanisms of modification strategies when carbon cloth acts as a host residence for lithium metal anodes. In the first part, the direct use of carbon cloth as a lithium metal anode using SEI and the mechanism of LixC reaction occurring when carbon cloth acts as anode host are described through a section. In the second part, the carbon cloth surface modification strategies using heteroatom doping and functional group introduction as well as the construction of surface nanoscale cracks are described in one section, and their common features are summarized. In the third section, the lithium metal anode modification strategies using lithiophilic but non-reactive materials (CNTs, heteroatom-doped graphene, etc.) and lithiophilic and reactive materials (Zn, ZnO, CuO, CoO, TiO2 etc.) to modify carbon cloth to build surface nanostructures are presented in two sections, and the intrinsic mechanisms are clarified through the same type of work. We conclude that the use of heteroatom doping and nanostructure construction can significantly enhance the lithiophilicity of carbon cloth and will help to improve the long cycle life and post-cycle capacity retention of its symmetric cells.",Energy Storage Materials
A Liquid-Metal Electrocatalyst as a Self-Healing Anchor to Suppress Polysulfide Shuttling in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium-sulfur battery (LSB) is a promising next generation energy storage technology due to its high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environmental friendliness surpassing current lithium-ion batteries. However, several challenges restrict the practical applications of LSBs. A major obstacle that limits its performance is the dissolution of long-chain lithium polysulfides into the electrolyte which results in loss of active material and capacity fade during the charge/discharge cycles. Here, we developed a novel sulfur composite with liquid-metal (LM) nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) dispensed on a carbon-cloth electrode to achieve long cycling of LSBs. The liquid nature of the LM nanoparticles results in many advantages. It provides a strong anchoring with sulfur inhibiting the polysulfide shuttle effect. In addition, it prevents the detachment of the sulfur particles from the current collector albeit large volume changes and cracking of the sulfur during lithiation and delithiation, maintaining the electron conduction paths. This innovative composite resulted in a high discharge capacity, an outstanding capacity retention, and a high Coulombic efficiency. Our results demonstrate an effective method to suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect and pave a new path towards practical applications of LSBs by using multifunctional LM nanoparticles composites.",Batteries and Supercaps
Enhanced Polysulfide Conversion with Highly Conductive and Electrocatalytic Iodine-Doped Bismuth Selenide Nanosheets in Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The shuttling behavior and sluggish conversion kinetics of intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS) represent the main obstacles to the practical application of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, an innovative sulfur host is proposed, based on an iodine-doped bismuth selenide (I-Bi2Se3), able to solve these limitations by immobilizing the LiPS and catalytically activating the redox conversion at the cathode. The synthesis of I-Bi2Se3 nanosheets is detailed here and their morphology, crystal structure, and composition are thoroughly. Density-functional theory and experimental tools are used to demonstrate that I-Bi2Se3 nanosheets are characterized by a proper composition and micro- and nano-structure to facilitate Li+ diffusion and fast electron transportation, and to provide numerous surface sites with strong LiPS adsorbability and extraordinary catalytic activity. Overall, I-Bi2Se3/S electrodes exhibit outstanding initial capacities up to 1500 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and cycling stability over 1000 cycles, with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.012% per cycle at 1 C. Besides, at a sulfur loading of 5.2 mg cm−2, a high areal capacity of 5.70 mAh cm−2 at 0.1 C is obtained with an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 12 µL mg−1. This work demonstrated that doping is an effective way to optimize the metal selenide catalysts in LSBs.",Advanced Functional Materials
Engineering Pt heterogeneous catalysts for accelerated liquid–solid redox conversion in Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesThe shuttle effect caused by soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) deteriorates multiphase transformation reaction kinetics of sulfur species, and gives rise to an unserviceable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery. Catalysis, as a process optimization approach, offers an option to eliminate the intrinsic issues. However, exploring and understanding the role of catalysts on electrode reaction remains critical bottlenecks, particularly as they are prone to continuous evolution under complex dynamic environment. Herein, platinum nanoparticles loaded on MXene nanosheets, as sulfur host, and the action of catalysts on the reaction process are investigated via ex-situ monitors upon solid–liquid–solid chemical transformation of sulfur species. These traces confirm that the high performance originates from electron transfer between catalysts and LiPSs, which lowers the nucleation barrier from liquid LiPSs to solid Li2S/Li2S2. Further, the accelerated liquid–solid conversion can alleviate the accumulation of LiPSs, and boost the reaction kinetics in Li-S batteries. The findings corroborate the electronic modulation between catalysts and LiPSs, which is a generalizable strategy to optimize energy conversion efficiency of Li-S batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

"Upcycling of electroplating sludge into Fe3C-decorated N,P dual-doped porous carbon via microalgae as efficient sulfur host for lithium–sulfur batteries","© 2022Some crystal planes of metal compound nanocrystals play an important role in the anchoring and transformation of lithium polysulfide (LiPSs), which effectively improves the shuttle effect and electrochemical reaction kinetics of LiPSs. While, as a new generation of secondary batteries with great potential, the commercial applications of Li-S batteries are limited by rapid capacity decay due to the shuttle effect of LiPSs and large volume change of sulfur. Herein, nano-Fe3C@N,P dual-doped porous carbon microspheres (Fe3C@NPC) were designed as cathode hosts of Li-S batteries. Fe3C@NPC composite materials were prepared by upcycling mental from electroplating sludge via microalgae. The adsorption transformation of microalgae enables Fe3C nanocrystals of 10–30 nm to be evenly embedded in the N and P dual-doped carbon materials, which makes the crystal planes (220) of Fe3C nanocrystals more involved in the reaction, thus improving the coulomb efficiency and long cycle stability of Li-S battery. Besides, the hierarchically porous spherical structure with high specific surface area not only effectively adapts to the change of sulfur volume during the charging/discharging process, but also significantly increases the electrolyte contact area and shortens the Li ion transport distance. Therefore, Fe3C@NPC, as the multifunctional hosts of sulfur for Li-S batteries, realizes high catalytic activity and strong chemical binding with LiPSs, providing a high reversible coulomb efficiency (> 99%) and a high reversible capacity of 575 mAh g−1 at 1 C after 500 cycles, with low-capacity decay rates of 0.056% per cycle.",Surfaces and Interfaces
Structural regulation of single-atomic site catalysts for enhanced electrocatalytic CO2 reduction,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is considered an efficient way to convert CO2 into high-value-added chemicals, and thus is of significant social and economic value. Metal single-atomic site catalysts (SASCs) generally have excellent selectivity because of their 100% atomic utilization and uniform structure of active sites, and thus promise a broad range of applications. However, SASCs still face challenges such as low intrinsic activity and low density of active sites. Precise regulation of the microstructures of SASCs is an effective method to improve their CO2RR performance and to obtain deep reduction products. In this article, we systematically summarize the current research status of SASCs developed for highly efficient catalysis of CO2RR, discuss the various structural regulation methods for enhanced activity and selectivity of SASCs for CO2RR, and review the application of in-situ characterization technologies in the SASC-catalyzed CO2RR. We then discuss the problems yet to be solved in this area, and propose the future directions of the research on the design and application of SASCs for CO2RR.

N-doped monodisperse carbon nanospheres with high surface area for highly efficient CO2 capture,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Carbon nanospheres are attractive materials with great potentials in many applications. Herein, we presented the synthesis and CO2 capture of N-doped monodisperse carbon nanospheres with high surface area. Spherical 3-aminophenol-formaldehyde resin with uniform size and shape was used as the precursor, which was then converted into carbon nanospheres through KHCO3 activation. KHCO3 activation was the key to the synthesis of carbon spheres, because it led to the formation of highly porous structure with surface area up to 3096 m2/g, and perfectly preserved the spherical shape at the same time. In contrast, the spherical structure was completely destroyed during KOH activation. The carbon nanospheres also showed high nitrogen content of 2.54–8.54 wt%. CO2 adsorption performances of the carbon nanospheres were studied with pressure up to 20 bar. The carbons showed impressively high uptakes of 31.42/21.55 mmol/g at 0/25 °C and 20 bar, which outperformed many reported results under the same conditions. The correlation between CO2 adsorption performances and physicochemical properties at different pressures were studied and revealed.",Separation and Purification Technology
Molecular sieve based Janus separators for Li-ions redistribution to enable stable lithium deposition,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.During operation of a lithium metal battery, uneven lithium deposition often results in the growth of lithium dendrites and causes a rapid decay in battery performance and even leads to safety issues. This is still the main hurdle hindering the practical application of lithium metal anodes. We report a new type of Janus separator fabricated by introducing a molecular sieve coating on the surface of the polypropylene separator that serves as a redistribution layer for lithium ions. Our results show that using this layer, the growth of lithium dendrites can be largely inhibited and the battery performance greatly improved. In a typical Li∥Cu half-cell with the Janus separator, the Coulombic efficiency of the lithium metal anode can be maintained at > 98.5% for over 500 cycles. The cycling life span is also extended by a factor of 8 in the Li∥Li symmetric cell. Furthermore, the high-strength coating improves the mechanical properties of the separator, thus enhancing safety. The effectiveness of our strategy is demonstrated by both the inhibited growth of lithium dendrites and the improved battery performance. Our methodology could eventually be generalized for electrode protection in other battery systems. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research
A highly photosensitive covalent organic framework with pyrene skeleton as metal-free catalyst for arylboronic acid hydroxylation,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been widely utilized in metal-free photocatalytic synthesis base on their excellent properties such as super conjugation, porosity and stability. In this work, we synthesized a new COF material using 1,3,6,8-Tetrakis (p-formylphenyl)pyrene (TFPPy) and 2,2′-Dimethylbenzidine (DMBZ) as basic units through Schiff base condensation reaction. The new COF (TF-DM COF) was applied as metal-free catalyst for hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. The results indicated that the extended π conjugation of COFs enhanced the absorption of visible light, and the large porosity (BET surface area: 113.782 m2g−1) accelerated the reaction rate. Good recyclability enables it with multiple applications, which result in a great reducing of the cost.

Revealing the superlative electrochemical properties of o-B2N2 monolayer in Lithium/Sodium-ion batteries,"© 2022 The AuthorsPromising flexible electrochemical energy storage systems (EESSs) are currently drawing considerable attention for their tremendous prospective end-use in portable self-powered electronic devices, including roll-up displays, and “smart” garments outfitted with piezoelectric patches to harvest energy from body movement. However, the lack of suitable battery electrodes that provides a specific electrochemical performance has made further development of these technologies challenging. Two-dimensional (2D) lightweight and flexible materials with outstanding physical and chemical properties, including mechanical strengths, hydrophilic surfaces, high surface metal diffusivity, and good conductivity, have been identified as a potential prospect for battery electrodes. In this study, taking a new 2D boron nitride allotrope, namely 2D orthorhombic diboron dinitride monolayer (o-B2N2) as representatives, we systematically explored several influencing factors, including electronic, mechanical, and their electrochemical properties (e.g., binding strength, ionic mobility, equilibrium voltage, and theoretical capacity). Considering potential charge-transfer polarization, we employed a charged electrode model to simulate ionic mobility and found ionic mobility has a unique dependence on the surface atomic configuration influenced by bond length, valence electron number, electrical conductivity, excellent ionic mobility, low equilibrium voltage with excellent stability, good flexibility, and extremely superior theoretical capacity, up to 8.7 times higher than that of widely commercialized graphite (3239.74 mAh g−1 Vs 372 mAh g−1) in case of Li-ion batteries and 2159.83 mAh g−1 in case of Na-ion batteries, indicating that the new predicted 2D o-B2N2 monolayer possess the capability to be ideal flexible anode materials for Lithium and Sodium-ion battery.

In situ thermal-induced generation of {Ag0AgI} dimer within Co-Ag phosphonates,"© 2021The thermal decomposition of AgNO3 is known to produce metallic Ag, but single-atomic dispersion is hard to achieve instead of the aggregation state of nanoparticles. Herein, we develop an efficient approach to thermally generate and stabilize single Ag atoms via the coordination effect. Two desired Co-Ag phosphonates [AgI2CoIII2(notpH3)2(NO3)]X [X = NO3− (1) or ClO4− (2)] were synthesized by solid-phase grinding method or solution crystallization. Both crystal structures reveal slightly different packing arrangements of various lattice anions and identical one-dimensional (1-D) coordination chains, formed in each case by the coordination of Ag(I) to the metalloligand Co(notpH3) and NO3− anion. The number of Ag(I) ions connected to each NO3− anion reduces from 5 in bulk AgNO3 to 2 in compounds 1 and 2, leading to the AgNO3 component stepwise decomposition at a lower temperature (<300 °C). During the thermal decomposition, the changes of supermolecular structures and Ag oxidation states were monitored by PXRD, IR and XAFS measurements. The most interesting finding is that 1 and 2 can retain chain structures and harvest Ag(0) atoms in the chain by controlling decomposition temperatures (220 °C for 1 and 254 °C for 2).",Chinese Chemical Letters
Bi nanoparticles in situ encapsulated by carbon film as high-performance anode materials for Li-ion batteries,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesBismuth (Bi) has indeed inspired great interests in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the high capacity, but was still limited by the low electrical conductivity and large volume variation. Herein, a composite material based on Bi nanoparticles in situ encapsulated by carbon film (Bi@CF) is prepared successfully through a facile metal–organic framework (MOF)-engaged approach. As anode materials for LIBs, the Bi@CF composites achieved high reversible capacities of 705 and 538 mAh g−1 at 0.2 and 0.5 A g−1 after 200 cycles, and long cycling performance with a stable capacity of 306 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 even after 900 cycles. In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements clearly revealed the conversion between Bi and Li3Bi during the alloying/dealloying process, confirming the good electrochemical reversibility of Bi@CF for Li-storage. The reaction kinetics of this Bi@CF composite was further studied by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT).

Oxygen-Rich Cobalt–Nitrogen–Carbon Porous Nanosheets for Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) materials have attracted much interest in bifunctional oxygen-involving electrocatalysis for rechargeable Zn–air batteries. Such M–N–C electrocatalysts with M–Nx sites show good activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) but moderate activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, an oxygen-rich M–N–C material (O–Co–N/C) with a highly porous nanosheet structure is reported as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, which is prepared by the direct pyrolysis of ultrathin CoO nanosheets decorated with zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 nanoparticles under an inert atmosphere. Particularly, Co nanoparticles in the O–Co–N/C electrocatalyst contain both Co–Nx and Co–Ox coordination environments to provide intrinsic active sites for the ORR and OER, respectively. Furthermore, electrochemical studies show that the O–Co–N/C catalyst retains comparable ORR activity to common M–N–C materials with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode and better OER activity with an overpotential of 0.29 V at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. This study provides insights into the development of effective oxygen-involving electrocatalysts with bifunctional metal active centers coordinated by both nitrogen and oxygen atoms.",Advanced Functional Materials
"From trash to treasure: Chemical recycling and upcycling of commodity plastic waste to fuels, high-valued chemicals and advanced materials","© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesOf all the existing materials, plastics are no doubt among the most versatile ones. However, the extreme increases in plastic production as well as the difficulty of the material for degradation have led to a huge number of plastic wastes. Their recycling rate after disposal is less than 10%, resulting in a series of serious environmental and ecological problems as well as a significant waste of resources. Current recycling methods generally suffer from large energy consumption, the low utilization rate of recycled products with low added value, and produce other waste during the process. Here, we summarized recently-developed chemical recycling ways on commodity plastics, especially new catalytic paths in production of fuels, high-valued chemicals and advanced materials from a single virgin or a mixture of plastic waste, which have emerged as promising ways to valorize waste plastics more economically and environmentally friendly. The new catalyst design criteria as well as innovative catalytic paths and technologies for plastic upcycling are highlighted. Beyond energy recovery by incineration, these approaches demonstrate how waste plastics can be a viable feedstock for energy use with the generation of clean H2, high-quality liquid fuels and materials for energy storage, and help inspiring more catalytic process on plastic upcycling to overcome the economical hurdle and building a circular plastic economy.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Dual-metal zeolite imidazolate framework for efficient lithium storage boosted by synergistic effects and self-assembly 2D nanosheets,"© 2022Metal-organic framework materials (MOFs), such as zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), have been widely used in energy storage due to their advantages such as high structural stability, large specific surface, more active sites and skeleton structures. Herein, a novel two-dimensional (2D) CoCu-ZIF was synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. The as-prepared CoCu-ZIF nanosheets exhibit an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 2287.4 mAh/g and remains at 1172.1 mAh/g after 300 cycles at a current density of 100 mA/g, far better than that of the single Co-ZIF and Cu-ZIF. Additionally, the specific discharge capacity of CoCu-ZIF nanosheets can maintain at about 590 mAh/g after 1000 cycles at the current density of 2 A/g. Owing to the synergistic effect of two metals, function of nitrogen in the molecular and self-assembly 2D nanosheets, our research can provide strong support for the practical application of CoCu-ZIF materials in lithium ion batteries.",Chinese Chemical Letters
Anion Immobilization Enabled by Cation-Selective Separators for Dendrite-Free Lithium Metal Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The lithium dendrite issue is a major bottleneck that limits the utilization of lithium metal anodes in high-energy rechargeable batteries. From the perspective of the dendrite nucleation mechanism, this work develops a new type of cation-selective (CS) separator with anion immobilization behavior to boost the lithium metal anode. By taking advantage of the poly(vinylidene fluoride) matrix, a strong binding force with anions contributes to an excellent CS property of the separator, which is further confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. The CS separator developed in this work presents a high lithium-ion transference number up to 0.81. Considering such a dramatically reduced transference number of anions, it can prolong the nucleation time of lithium dendrite and thus achieve a high-stable Li plating/stripping cycling for 1000 h at a high applied current density of 3 mA cm−2. The Li metal stabilization function of the CS separator is further studied in detail through both in-situ and ex-situ observations of dendrites growth. When integrating into lithium metal batteries (LMBs), the CS separators also contribute to enhanced electrochemical performances including discharge capacity, rate capability, and cycling durability. This work is anticipated to provide considerable insight for the creative design of CS separators toward dendrite-free LMBs.",Advanced Functional Materials

In this work, we report an integrated bifunctional electrocatalyst composed of CoPt nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the carbon nanosheet array (CNs@CoPt), which exhibits excellent activity for both cathodic hydrogen evolution in a wide range of pH conditions and anodic glycerol oxidation reaction. Based on this novel electrocatalyst, a hydrogen evolution coupled with glycerol oxidation system was constructed, exhibiting dramatically enhanced hydrogen production rate (48 L h−1 m−2) in cathode, larger than traditional water splitting system (27 L h−1 m−2), and gaining high-valuable product (formate, 113 g h−1 m−2) in anode. Moreover, a quite high utilization degree of Pt (35.1%) is achieved on CNs@CoPt owing to this hierarchical and alloy structure, 3.3 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C (10.6 %). We believe that the strategy demonstrated in this work can be extended to fabricate other multifunctional integrated electrocatalysts with high performance for hydrogen production.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Interface transition from Ohmic to Schottky contact in Ti3X2/MoS2 (X= B, C, N): Insights from first-principles","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Ti3C2 MXene has received tremendous interest as a potential electrode in flexible electronics due to its promising electronic and mechanical properties. However, its inherent properties determine the interfacial performance and the interfacial properties with MoS2 are critical to nanoelectronics device. Based on first-principles calculations, the mechanical properties of Ti3X2 (X= B, C or N) and interfacial properties of Ti3X2/MoS2 by strain are investigated. The Ti3N2 shows advantages in strength and conductivity, and all Ti3X2/MoS2 interfaces exhibit Ohmic contact without tunneling barrier. Furthermore, depending on the nearly disappearing interface hybridization by controlling vertical strain, a transition from Ohmic to Schottky contact occurs. The differences in metal work function and interface dipole potential make the Schottky contact display n-type in Ti3B2/MoS2 and Ti3C2/MoS2, while p-type in Ti3N2/MoS2 until the vertical strain reaches 3.60 Å. Moreover, the increasing vertical strain is accompanied by the rising tunneling barrier, and weak interfacial interaction makes the variation of barrier more sensitive to strain. The results demonstrate that vertical strain is an effective way of controlling metal-semiconductor interface and provide guidance for designing Schottky devices.",Surfaces and Interfaces

Till now, the development of efficient LICs with high energy-power densities with high cyclic stability is restricted due to the limited performance of the electrode in terms of low capacity and sluggish reaction kinetics. Developing a novel electrode that overcomes these existing drawbacks is one of the possible strategies to enhance electrochemical performance. In this work, the superior Li-ion storage capability of highly interconnected Cu2SnS3 (CSS) nanospheres encapsulated in the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) framework as an efficient anode for LIC is demonstrated. Benefiting from the combined charge storage mechanisms of the CSS (alloying + conversion) and the CNTs (insertion), an exceptional high electrochemical performance in terms of high energy density (158.77 Wh/kg) and high power density (12,500 W/kg) with superior cyclic stability for 10,000 cycles is obtained from the fabricated LIC device. The key factors attributed to the improved electrochemical performance are studied in detail using experimental results, comprehensive characterization techniques and are strongly supported by the relevant simulated models based on theoretical calculations. The plausible binding characteristics of the Li-ion and the valence charge transfer in the electrodes are evaluated using first-principle density functional theory (DFT).",Journal of Energy Storage

Horizontally aligned lamellar porous graphene/nickel composite for high volumetric capacity lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Although lithium-sulfur batteries have the advantages of gravimetric energy density, it remains a challenge to achieve high volumetric energy density in lithium-sulfur batteries due to the employment of conductive porous carbon with low tap density and high porosity. To this context, we synthesized a horizontally aligned lamellar porous graphene/nickel composite (LPG-Ni) as a dense sulfur host material to increase the volumetric capacity of lithium-sulfur batteries while retaining high gravimetric capacity. The nickel decorated on the surface of the porous graphene serves as active sites, effectively adsorbing and catalytically converting polysulfides, thus improving the redox kinetics and reducing shuttle effect. More importantly, the abundant pores on the graphene sheet are considered as a shortcut for lithium-ion diffusion, which accelerates the ion transport through the whole electrode. Owing to the synergistic effect, the as-prepared sulfur cathode exhibits both excellent ionic and electronic conductivity, and has a dense-stacked structure. Thus, the LPG-Ni/S cathode provides high gravimetric and volumetric capacity (718.7 mA h g-1cathode and 884.0 mA h cm-3cathode at 0.1C). Meanwhile, the battery exhibits superior rate capability (369.7 mA h cm-3cathode at 5C) and cycling performance (1000 cycles, 0.037% decay per cycle at 1C).",Applied Surface Science
Metal-Porphyrin Frameworks Supported by Carbon Nanotubes: Efficient Polysulfide Electrocatalysts for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfide batteries (LSBs) are highly appealing for the next-generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, practical applications of LSBs are still largely hindered by the complicated sulfur redox reactions and the fatal polysulfide shuttling. In nature, cytochrome c reductase works as an efficient biocatalyst for oxidative phosphorylation benefiting from the synergistic electron transfer between porphyrins and sulfur clusters. Inspired by this, herein, two porphyrin-based metal-organic frameworks (Hf-H2DPBP and Hf-CoDPBP) supported by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were demonstrated to be efficient electrocatalysts for accelerating polysulfide redox kinetics when as separator coatings for LSBs. Consequently, the cells exhibited high initial specific capacities of 1345 mAh g-1 (Hf-H2DPBP/CNT) and 1325 mAh g-1 (Hf-CoDPBP/CNT) at 0.1 C, and maintained outstanding stability with capacities of 582 mAh g-1 (Hf-H2DPBP/CNT) and 513 mAh g-1 (Hf-CoDPBP/CNT) after 500 cycles at 2 C with a decay rate of only 0.079% and 0.086% per cycle, respectively. Even at a high sulfur loading up to 6.2 mg/cm2, the cells still demonstrated excellent performances with an initial specific capacity of 911 mAh g-1 (Hf-H2DPBP/CNT) and 952 mAh g-1 (Hf-CoDPBP/CNT) at 0.1 C, and retained the specific capacities of 745 mAh g-1 (Hf-H2DPBP/CNT) and 818 mAh g-1 (Hf-CoDPBP/ CNT) after 60 cycles, respectively. Furthermore, the high and comparable electrochemical performances can be attributed to the remarkable redox kinetics of both free-base and Co porphyrins toward polysulfides, as supported by DFT calculations.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Layer structured materials for ambient nitrogen fixation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Recently, the research of nitrogen fixation at ambient conditions has attracted wide attention due to its potential of relatively low energy consumption and environmental friendliness. The rational design of catalysts is one of the pivotal factors to achieve high nitrogen fixation efficiency. On account of the large exposed surfaces areas, continuous conducting pathways, open shortened diffusion distances, stable in−plane chemical bonds, expanded interlayer spacing, as well as weak van der Waals interaction within layers, it has been an extensive option to choose layer structured materials as potential nitrogen fixation materials in recent years. Notably, compared to other nitrogen − fixation catalysts, layered materials not only reduce the migration distances between the reaction interface and charge carriers, inhibiting the possibility of charge carrier recombination, but also enrich low–coordinated surface atoms. Moreover, most of them belonging to p–block materials show excellent hydrophobicity, strong chemical interaction with N2 molecules, and low cost, which make them promising candidates for effectively limiting hydrogen evolution. Despite the favorable advantages of the layer structured materials on nitrogen fixation, more challenges and opportunities have arisen for the exploitation and fabrication of novel layered materials with unique properties and specific functions to achieve high selectivity and high yield. Up to now, although the research scope of layered structured materials has been expanded gradually and their structural feature supply an alternative way of improving nitrogen fixation properties while puting forwarding relative binding and effect mechanisms, the adsorption and catalysis mechanisms of these materials in nitrogen fixation are still controversial due to the lack of in situ/operando characterization and neglect of the complex reaction system and environment factors. In this review, we firstly summarize typical layered materials used in nitrogen fixation and categorize them into metal–containing and metal–free materials. The former includes transition metal dichalcogenides, MXenes, and metal–organic frameworks, as well as other emerging advanced materials such as layered double hydroxides, bismuth–based layered materials while the latter includes graphene, graphitic carbon nitride sheet, black phosphorus, boron–based layered materials, and covalent organic framework. Secondly, we briefly introduce the structural characteristics and the recently reported synthesis strategies based on the typical layer structured materials, and discuss their structure–performance relationship. Thirdly, insights into possible pathways, strategies, and products of nitrogen fixation are discussed to provide layer structured materials with corresponding suitable avenues in the future. More importantly, their up–to–date progress applied in photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reactions will be systematically presented, and the concomitant obstacles are also revealed. At last, the strategies, challenges, and prospects for future developments of nitrogen fixation materials at room temperature and pressure are summarized.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Biomimetic cascade nanoreactor with triple-enzyme mimetic activities for colorimetric detection of acid phosphatase,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Delighted by the high catalytic efficiency and superior selectivity of multiple enzyme-driven biological catalytic cascades, biomimetic cascade nanoreactors have drawn much attention recently. Here, a new type of biomimetic cascade nanoreactor – Co nanoparticles embedded N-enriched carbon nanocubes (Co,N-CNC) which derived from ZIF-67 nanocubes was designed and utilized for acid phosphatase (ACP) detection. The distinctive composition and cubic structure endowed Co,N-CNC with significantly enhanced triple-enzyme mimetic activities, including oxidase (OXD)-, peroxidase (POD)-, and catalase (CAT)-like activities. Employing the OXD- and POD-like activities of Co,N-CNC nanoreactor, a cascade amplification strategy was proposed for the first time for ACP colorimetric detection without the assistance of destructive H2O2. Based on the high catalytic activity of Co,N-CNC and the cascade amplification strategy, a good linear relationship was obtained from 0.01 to 10.0 mU/mL, with a lower detection limit of 6.1 μU/mL. Significantly, the Co,N-CNC could detect ACP in human serum samples with high accuracy. Therefore, the Co,N-CNC nanoreactor with triple-enzyme mimetic activities displayed broad prospects for biosensing, medical diagnostics and biotechnological research.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Self-assembled, highly-lithiophilic and well-aligned biomass engineered MXene paper enables dendrite-free lithium metal anode in carbonate-based electrolyte","© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesLithium metal anode is the ideal candidate for high-energy–density rechargeable batteries. However, uncontrolled dendrite growth hampers its commercialization. Herein, a dendrite-free composite Li metal anode is realized by a flexible, freestanding, well-aligned and highly-lithiophilic MXene paper designed by a facile electrostatic self-assembly of the exfoliated MXene nanosheets and natural polysaccharide-chitosan (MX@CS). The MX@CS paper gets a well-aligned layered-3D structure with a micro-crumpled surface that can effectively decrease the local current density, guide even Li plating and suppress dendritic Li growth. More importantly, surface-adsorbed chitosan endows enhanced lithiophilicity for MXene substrate and thus reduces the Li nucleation overpotential, which is confirmed by the density functional theory calculations. Abundant lithiophilic groups on MX@CS surface provide high-concentration Li+ anchoring site promoting Li nucleation and laterally inducing uniform Li deposition, which effectively avoids the formation of dendritic Li. As a result, the MX@CS-Li anode with a dendrite-free Li morphology shows a significantly improved cycling life in commercial carbonate-based electrolyte. When coupled with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode, the full cell exhibits a low capacity decay and steady ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at a current density of 5C. These findings develop a new approach for designing high-performance metal-based rechargeable batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Phosphorus/oxygen co-doping in hollow-tube-shaped carbon nitride for efficient simultaneous visible-light-driven water splitting and biorefinery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The integration of photocatalytic biorefinery and water-splitting to hydrogen in one system is promising, yet limited success has been achieved. Herein, a spiral-tube-shaped carbon nitride photocatalyst (named as PACN) with phosphorus (P)/oxygen (O) co-doping was developed, which can be successfully used in the simultaneous visible-light-driven water splitting and biorefinery. The unique structure and P/O co-doping of PACN significantly enhanced the visible light absorption range and accelerated the migration/separation of photo-generated carriers. The hydrogen evolution rate over PACN reached 6437.65 μmol g-1h−1, which is 10.08 times higher than that of pristine carbon nitride. Meanwhile, the yield of lactic acid was as high as 93.01%. The universality of hydrogen evolution from various biomass-derived monosaccharides was demonstrated. Pentoses were more suitable for lactic acid production. Moreover, ·O2– played a primary role in the oxidation half-reaction.

First-principles investigation of elastic and electronic properties of double transition metal carbide MXenes,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.We use first-principles-based density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the structural, elastic, and electronic properties of various pristine and oxygen (O)-functionalized double transition metal (DTM) MXenes with general formulas of M2′M′′C2 and M2′M′′C2O2, where M′ = Mo, Cr and M′′ = Ti, V, Nb, Ta. The dynamic stability of the DTM MXenes are assessed and elastic stiffness constants (Cij) are used to investigate the mechanical stability and properties of the compositions. The calculated elastic properties of the pristine Mo-based MXenes are found to be superior compared to Cr-based compounds. Furthermore, the O-functionalized MXenes exhibit improved in-plane elastic constants, Young's moduli, and shear moduli compared to their pristine counterpart. We observe that the hybridization of the energy states results in stronger covalent interactions as such increased elastic properties for the M2′M′′C2O2 MXenes. Ashby plot clearly demonstrates superior materials properties of O-functionalized Mo-based DTM MXenes compared to other commonly known two-dimensional materials. All the MXenes exhibit metallic character evident from the density of states (DOS) calculations. Additionally, the work functions are studied and the calculated values are higher in the case of O-functionalized MXenes. Overall, this work will be a guide for future investigations on the mechanical properties of DTM MXenes for their targeted applications in structural nanocomposites.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society

This work explored the unique electronic, phonon, and optical characteristics of 2D-MoSe2 and 2D-WSe2 based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT). We have proposed two stable 2D-TMDs structures and included the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect to examine its impact on their structural properties. These SOC included structures exhibit large band splitting of 190 meV and 470 meV, respectively, appear at the top of the valance bands for 2D-MoSe2 and 2D-WSe2, suggesting promising results for next-generation spintronic devices. In addition, upon applying biaxial strain, the direct to indirect bandgap transition has been identified at a − 5% compressive strain for both 2D-MoSe2 and 2D-WSe2. We have also reported the peaks for real and imaginary values of the dielectric constant, optical absorption, and electron energy loss spectra, which may allow attractive applications for photovoltaic and electroluminescent devices. Under increased tensile strain, the absorption peaks of 2D-ASe2 monolayers gradually increase towards lower energy regions (redshift), while the absorption peaks of corresponding compressive strained structures exhibit blueshift. Moreover, the optical performance and light absorption capacity were greatly enhanced with increased tensile strain, making them promising candidates for digital electronics and optoelectronics device applications.",Materials Today Communications

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a decisive step in water splitting. Slow kinetics seriously limits the effective utilization of energy thus it is extremely urgent to develop electrocatalysts that can effectively reduce the reaction energy barrier thus accelerate OER kinetics. Here, Mn-Co0.85Se/NiSe2/NF nanosheets with 3D folded structure was assembled on Ni foam by electrodeposition and vapor-deposition method. Mn-Co0.85Se/NiSe2/NF can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with only 175 mV overpotential in an alkaline environment of 1 M KOH, which is much lower than other reported catalysts. In addition, catalyst Mn-Co0.85Se/NiSe2/NF also performed well in long-term stability tests.

Herein, a novel and convenient tactic is developed to design and fabricate the tetrazole-functionalized COF materials with abundant nitrogen atoms, which can provide active sites, facilitating the incorporation of COFs with metal ions. In particular, a β-ketoenamine-linked COF named COF-TpDb is selected as precursor for postsynthetic modification to introduce the tetrazole moieties to coordinate with metal ions cobalt (Co2+) and palladium (Pd2+), giving two functional metal-coordinated COFs complexes COF-TpDb-TZ-Co and COF-TpDb-TZ-Pd. The resultant COF-TpDb-TZ-Co displays a higher oxygen evolution reaction activity with a lower overpotential of 390 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is much enhanced compared with COF-TpDb-TZ.

Published by ELSEVIER B.V. and Science Press.Lithium (Li) metal has emerged as the most promising anode for rechargeable Li batteries owing to its high theoretical specific capacities, low negative electrochemical potential, and superior electrical conductivity. Replacing the conventional graphite anodes with Li metal anodes (LMAs) provides great potential to exceed the theoretical limitations of current commercial Li-ion batteries, leading to next-generation high-energy–density rechargeable Li metal batteries (LMBs).

Building ultra-stable K–Te battery by molecular regulation,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesTellurium (Te) is an ideal electrode for potassium ion batteries (PIBs) owing to its excellent electronic conductivity and high volumetric capacity. However, the Te electrode is prone to capacity fading as the shuttle effect. To address this challenge, we propose molecular regulated Se–Te solid solutions on N-doped porous carbon as the PIBs electrode. After optimizing the Se content in Se–Te solid solutions, the resultant SeTe6.8 on N-doped porous carbon (SeTe6.8@C) delivered a capacity of over 400 mAh g−1 with a flat plateau of 1.0 V at 500 mA g−1. It also achieved a superiorly long cycle life, running for more than 1600 cycles (over 7 months with 0.015% degeneration per cycle) at 100 mA g−1 and excellent rate performance (179.9 mAh g−1 at 10000 mA g−1). This remarkable electrochemical energy storage of the Te electorde likely arises from suppression of the shuttle effect after doping the Te with strongly electronegative Se atoms (forming K5Te3 which is not easily soluble in electrolyte). This study presents a fresh approach for designing and developing ultra-stable Te-based electrodes for PIBs and beyond.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

However, the related reports on the synthesis and functionalization of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) by the one-pot approach are limited. Herein, we selectively introduced three different functional groups (fluoroalkyl, borate, and alkyl groups) to verify that the multi-component one-pot tandem reaction could be applied into surface post-functionalization of COFs as an economical strategy. After proving the practicability of the economical strategy, we also prepared two kinds of fluorine-containing COFs (COF-F0.5 and COF-F) and butyl-containing COF (COF-Bu) via the economical strategy to explore the effect of COF nature (porosity and the number of functional groups) on fipronil adsorption. The results showed that COF-F0.5 possessing the largest Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (1573 m2 g−1) exhibited a larger saturated adsorption capacity (194.7 mg g−1) than COF-F (149.8 mg g−1). Furthermore, comparing with COF-Bu (122.4 mg g−1), COF-F (149.8 mg g−1) containing functional groups showed a greater adsorption capacity. Graphical abstract: Post-functionalization of covalent organic frameworks by multiple-component one-pot tandem reactions was reported and the related application in the adsorption of pesticides was also studied.

Understanding the interaction of N-doped graphene and sulfur compounds in a lithium-sulfur battery: a density functional theory investigation,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe generalized gradient approximation (GGA) density functional theory (DFT), Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh (PBE), and long-range corrected DFT (ωB97XD) were used to investigate the interaction between lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx, x = 2-8) and N-doped graphene to understand the adsorption mechanism and effect of catalytic conversion, including the reduction from S8 to Li2S and Li2S decomposition. The binding of Li2Sx to N-doped graphene was significantly stronger than that to solvents, such as 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), approximately by 0.5-3.0 eV, indicating that N-doped graphenes possessed the ability to trap soluble Li2Sx. The binding of Li2Sx to N-doped graphenes followed the order of pyrrolic N > pyridinic N > graphene > graphitic N. Among them, pyrrolic N exhibited the strongest anchoring effect mainly via forming the coordination bond of LiN3. In addition, in all the investigated systems, the van der Waals force also played an important role in binding. We comprehensively analyzed the micro-nano-scale theoretical data, including charge, bond distance, bond order, electron density difference, the electron localization function (ELF), and the independent gradient model (IGM) of the Li ion and N atom. The strength of the Li-N bond confirmed that the strongest anchoring occurred when the Li ion was trapped above the vacancy-forming coordination bond rather than a regular covalent bond. Although the strength of Li-N binding had a direct effect on the binding energy, other thermodynamic parameters (free energy and dissociation energy) of catalytic conversion and the energy barrier of Li2S phase transformation also showed a similar capacity.",New Journal of Chemistry
Unveiling remarkable resistance to Pb poisoning over an Fe-Mo catalyst for low-temperature NH3-SCR: poison transforms into a promoter,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Although lead (Pb) poisoning is a significant issue in the low-temperature selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 (NH3-SCR), the development of an effective Pb-resistant catalyst presents a challenge. Herein, a Fe-Mo catalyst composed of highly dispersed α-Fe2O3 and β-FeMoO4 was designed that exhibits remarkable resistance to Pb poisoning, achieving more than 90% NOx conversion at 225-400 °C (GHSV = 50 000 h−1) even with a Pb content of 20 wt%. More importantly, the poisoned catalysts show higher intrinsic activity and lower apparent activation energy compared to fresh sample. The characterization results indicate that the Pb species is captured by abundant Brønsted acid sites (Mo-OH) to form a PbMoO4 phase, while barely influencing the Lewis acid sites and redox properties of the catalyst. The consumption kinetics of the adsorbed NH3 based on in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) confirmed that the surface PbMoO4 species effectively boost the activation of the reactants, thus improving the inherent NH3-SCR reactivity through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal pathways, which is the origin of the strong resistance against the high loading of Pb over the Mo-Fe catalyst. This work reveals a novel promotion mechanism of Pb species and provides a way in which to design a Pb-resistant low-temperature NH3-SCR catalyst.",Catalysis Science and Technology
The photocatalytic performance and mechanism of magnetically retrievable Z-scheme Cr2O3-Fe3O4/C hetero-nanostructure polyhedra,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryIn this study, Z-scheme Cr2O3-Fe3O4/C hetero-nanostructure polyhedra are prepared using the amine-functionalized metal-organic framework NH2-MIL-101(Fe) as the precursor through a simple hydrothermal method and impregnation-calcination route. Systematic characterization was conducted on the phase structure, morphology, optical/electrochemical properties and the photocatalytic performance exhibited by the magnetic Cr2O3-Fe3O4/C samples. As observed from the results, Congo red (CR) degradation rates of the magnetic polyhedron-like Cr2O3-Fe3O4/C hetero-nanostructures under visible light are found to be nearly 1.86 and 1.21 times higher than those achieved by Cr2O3 and Fe3O4/C samples, respectively. Complying with the results achieved by the active specie tests, superoxide radicals could be the major active species in the CR photocatalytic degradation due to graphite carbon with high conductivity. On this basis, a model Z-scheme photogenerated carrier transfer system was developed. In the present paper, an approach for developing and designing Z-scheme hetero-nanostructure photocatalysts for purifying wastewater is presented.",New Journal of Chemistry
A sodiophilic VN interlayer stabilizing a Na metal anode,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sodium (Na) metal is a very encouraging anode material for next-generation rechargeable batteries owing to its high specific capacity, earth-abundance and low-cost. However, the application of Na metal anodes (SMAs) is hampered by dendrite growth and “dead” Na formation caused by the uncontrollable Na deposition, leading to poor cycle life and even safety concerns. Herein, a high-performance Na anode is designed by introducing an artificial VN interlayer on the Na metal surface (Na/VN) by a simple mechanical rolling process to regulate Na nucleation/deposition behaviors. The density functional theory (DFT) and experiment results uncover that the VN possesses high “sodiophilicity”, which can facilitate the initially homogeneous Na nucleation and cause Na to distribute evenly on the VN interlayer. Therefore, uniform Na deposition with dendrite-free morphology and prolonged cycling lifespan (over 1060 h at 0.5 mA cm−2/1 mA h cm−2) can be realized. Moreover, the full cell assembled by coupling a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode and Na/VN anode presents superior cycling performance (e.g., 96% capacity retention even after 800 cycles at 5C). This work provides a promising direction for regulating Na nucleation and deposition to achieve dendrite-free metal anodes.",Nanoscale Horizons
"Stimuli-responsive of magnetic metal-organic frameworks (MMOF): Synthesis, dispersion control, and its tunability into polymer matrix under the augmented-magnetic field for H2 separation and CO2 capturing applications","© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCSingle-crystal magnetic-responsive core-shell MOF by grafting Fe3O4 nanoparticles onto the UiO-66-NH2 and their controlled embedding into gas separation mixed matrix membranes was reported. Obtained results confirmed the stimuli-responsive character of the MMOF during their dispersion of MMOF in a well-defined arrays structure in the PMMA matrix. Contrarily, an absence of a magnetic field results in the MMOF aggregation and sedimentation of the particles at the bottom of the membrane. Compared to the non-controlled ones, gas permeability increased by 26.2% for CO2 and 76.67% for H2, and selectivity increased 2.95 and 1.49 times for the CO2/N2 and H2/CO2 gas pairs, respectively. Moreover, obtained permeability-selectivity values for the H2/CO2 gas pairs overcome the appropriate modified 2008 Robeson upper bound.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
In situ synthesis of morphology-controlled MoOx/Fe1−xS bifunctional catalysts for high-efficiency and stable alkaline water splitting,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe advancement of a bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of Earth's rich elements and exhibiting high efficiency is the key to obtain hydrogen fuel by overall water splitting (OWS). Here, a facile and extensible hydrothermal synthesis of an electrocatalyst on iron foam (MoOx/Fe1−xS/IF) as a robust bifunctional catalyst with excellent catalytic activity is designed for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with an overpotential of 142 mV at 100 mA cm−2, and for the OER with lower overpotentials of 300 and 500 mV at 100 and 1000 mA cm−2. The good activity is ascribed to the controllable morphology, stronger bonding of the catalyst to a substrate and optimized electronic configuration. When used as bifunctional electrocatalysts toward alkaline overall water splitting, MoOx/Fe1−xS/IF delivers a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low cell voltage of 1.56 V for 110 h. Such high performance coupled with low-cost iron-based materials suggests that the present strategy may open new avenues for the rational design of electrocatalysts and for use in practical water splitting.",Dalton Transactions
Heterostructured Ni3N-NiMoN Nanowires as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution and 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Affected by the slow kinetic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the cell voltage of water splitting is usually beyond 1.5 V, causing high energy consumption to produce hydrogen. Herein, heterostructural Ni3N-NiMoN nanowires supported on carbon cloth (Ni3N-NiMoN/CC) are successfully fabricated, and they can act as bifunctional electrocatalysts, exhibiting a low overpotential of 74 mV at 100 mA cm-2for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and a low potential of 1.39 V at 50 mA cm-2for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR), respectively. The HMFOR//HER device constructed by Ni3N-NiMoN/CC achieves a very low cell voltage of ∼1.29 V at 10 mA cm-2, which is 0.32 V lower than that of the OER//HER device. Specially, a value-added product of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid is obtained. Additionally, density functional theory calculations are carried out. This work provides a promising strategy to further reduce the cell voltage to generate hydrogen by replacing OER with biomass oxidation.",ACS Applied Nano Materials
Visible-Light-Driven Production of Solar Fuels Catalyzed by Nanosized Porphyrin-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks and Covalent-Organic Frameworks: A Review,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Porphyrin-based materials are excellent chromophores because they strongly absorb visible light and their relatively low-energy lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals thermodynamically favor photoinduced electron transfer. They can generate charge-transfer excited states with and without cocatalyst(s) and ease energy transfer and ultrafast excitation energy migration. Combined with synthetic accessibility, these qualities make them ideal building blocks for porous metal-organic framework (MOF)- and covalent-organic framework (COF)-based photocatalysts to produce solar fuels. This review first describes the structures of the most common porphyrinic MOFs and COFs and their excited-state properties and semiconducting behavior as well as that of derived composites. The generally accepted mechanisms of formation of H2, CH4and derivatives, and N2are then reviewed, followed by the detailed examples of nano-MOFs and nano-COFs used for the said purpose: characteristic parameters such as rates of production, turnover numbers (TONs), turnover frequencies (TOFs), and apparent quantum efficiencies are described and compared. This shows that porphyrin-based MOFs and COFs are efficient solar-fuel-producing photocatalysts, with characteristics comparable to those of nonporphyrinic MOF and COF photocatalysts, although, on some occasions, the rates of production fall short of record values. Conversely, porphyrinic MOFs and COFs exhibit the greatest TONs and TOFs of any solar-fuel-producing MOFs or COFs but still face shortcomings concerning selectivity in CH4production because of the many possible side products. Importantly, while the best rate of photoproduction of solar fuels has been observed from nanoscale photocatalysts, there seem to be no drastic differences in the rate (within μmol-1h-1and mmol g-1h-1) between nanoscale and microscale heterogeneous photocatalysts. This observation suggests that the more active sites are mostly located at or near the surface of the particles. Overall, nanosized porphyrin-based MOFs and COFs show rich and promising photocatalytic properties for generating solar fuels but still have room for improvement.",ACS Applied Nano Materials
Distribution Pattern of Metal Atoms in Bimetal-Doped Pyridinic-N4Pores Determines Their Potential for Electrocatalytic N2Reduction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Doping two single transition-metal (TM) atoms on a substrate host opens numerous possibilities for catalyst design. However, what if the substrate contains more than one vacancy site? Then, the combination of two TMs along with their distribution patterns becomes a design parameter potentially complementary to the substrate itself and the bimetal composition. In this study, we investigate ammonia synthesis under mild electrocatalytic conditions on a transition-metal-doped porous C24N24catalyst using density functional theory (DFT). The TMs studied include Ti, Mn, and Cu in a 2:4 dopant ratio (Ti2Mn4@C24N24and Ti2Cu4@C24N24). Our computations show that a single Ti atom in both catalysts exhibits the highest selectivity for N2fixation at ambient conditions. This work is a good theoretical model to establish the structure-activity relationship, and the knowledge earned from the metal-N4moieties may help studies of related nanomaterials, especially those with curved structures.",Journal of Physical Chemistry A
Advanced Separator Enabled by Sulfur Defect Engineering for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.A rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is being pursued as a promising candidate for future energy storage and conversion because of its theoretical high energy density and low cost. However, commercial application of Li-S batteries is critically impeded by their notorious shuttle effect and the sluggish conversion kinetics. In this work, we proposed a strategy to enhance the surface adsorption and the conversion of lithium polysulfides with the construction and concentration regulation of sulfur defects in MoS2nanosheets. The MoS2with relatively rich sulfur vacancies (MoS2-x-500°C) delivers significantly enhanced immobilization and accelerated conversion of polysulfides. Due to these beneficial effects, the Li-S battery with the MoS2-x-500°C-modified separator delivers a superb initial specific capacity of 961 mA h g-1at 1 C and the cycling stability with only 0.088% decay per cycle during 300 cycles. Even at the relatively high sulfur loading of 7 mg cm-2, the cell still displays a satisfactory areal capacity of 5.18 mA h cm-2at 0.2 C. The strategy of sulfur defect engineering proposed in this work has been proven to be a simple but efficient way for constructing high-performance Li-S batteries.",Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research
Thiophilic-Lithiophilic Hierarchically Porous Membrane-Enabled Full Lithium-Sulfur Battery with a Low N/P Ratio,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur batteries stand out as the next-generation batteries because of their high energy density and low cost. However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), growth of lithium dendrites, and overuse of lithium resources still hinder their further application. To address these problems, we constructed a porous network structure in which Sn is melted and coated on a frame that has a carbon nanotube (CNT) core and a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) coating as cross-linking shell (CNT@NC@Sn). This hierarchically porous membrane electrode, which has an ultrahigh porosity of approximately 90%, works as a matrix to strengthen the conductivity of Li+and electrons and provides enough space for the conversion between sulfur and LiPSs. Moreover, the in situ thin coating of Sn not only promotes the adsorption and catalytic conversion of LiPSs but also provides lithiophilic binding sites and induces uniform lithium deposition. Thus, the thiophilic-lithiophilic porous membrane electrode with lithium loaded on the frame (in the form of Sn-Li alloy) by electroplating can replace lithium sheets, reduce the use of Li, and improve the safety performance of the battery. Additionally, these dual-functional membranes boost the reaction kinetics and conductivity of the cathode by dispersing the sulfur slurry in the porous membrane framework. As a result, the lithium-sulfur full battery assembled with the CNT@NC@Sn integrated membrane electrode exhibits stable cycling with a reversible capacity of 617.1 mAh g-1after 200 cycles at 1 C. The capacity decay rate per cycle is 0.105%, and the N/P ratio is as low as 2.98.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Single-Step and Room-Temperature Synthesis of Laser-Induced Pt/VC Nanocomposites as Effective Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution and Oxygen Evolution Reactions,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The development of cost-effective Pt-based electrocatalysts is of great scientific and industrial significance for improving the electrocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions for overall water splitting. In this work, unlike traditional furnace pyrolysis, we report the rapid and single-step room-temperature synthesis of Pt/VC nanocomposites with a three-dimensional (3D) network porous structure by laser irradiation technology. The resultant Pt-based composite (Pt/VC-2.84) could be applied to HER under different pH conditions. In particular, the content of Pt in Pt/VC-2.84 is only 2.84 wt %, which is far lower than that in the advanced HER electrocatalyst with the Pt content of 20 wt % (commercial 20 wt % Pt/C). In addition, Pt/VC-2.84 exhibits a boosted higher OER activity and stability than RuO2in an alkaline medium. Most importantly, electrocatalytic results reflect that Pt/VC-2.84 reveals superior activity and stability toward overall water splitting.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Porous Dithiine-Linked Covalent Organic Framework as a Dynamic Platform for Covalent Polysulfide Anchoring in Lithium-Sulfur Battery Cathodes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Dithiine linkage formation via a dynamic and self-correcting nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction enables the de novo synthesis of a porous thianthrene-based two-dimensional covalent organic framework (COF). For the first time, this organo-sulfur moiety is integrated as a structural building block into a crystalline layered COF. The structure of the new material deviates from the typical planar interlayer π-stacking of the COF to form undulated layers caused by bending along the C-S-C bridge, without loss of aromaticity and crystallinity of the overall COF structure. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations of the COF and a model compound, featuring the thianthrene moiety, suggest partial delocalization of sulfur lone pair electrons over the aromatic backbone of the COF decreasing the band gap and promoting redox activity. Postsynthetic sulfurization allows for direct covalent attachment of polysulfides to the carbon backbone of the framework to afford a molecular-designed cathode material for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with a minimized polysulfide shuttle. The fabricated coin cell delivers nearly 77% of the initial capacity even after 500 charge-discharge cycles at 500 mA/g current density. This novel sulfur linkage in COF chemistry is an ideal structural motif for designing model materials for studying advanced electrode materials for Li-S batteries on a molecular level.",Journal of the American Chemical Society
Hierarchical CoSx/graphene/carbon nanotube hybrid architectures for bifunctional electrocatalysts in zinc-air battery,"© 2022 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering ChemistryHerein, we report multidimensional hybrid architectures wherein CoS2 nanoparticles are encapsulated in steam-activated reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotubes (CoSx@srGO/CNT) for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. CoSx nanoparticles work as catalysts to grow CNT branches onto the srGO, and the CoSx@srGO/CNT act as bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The bifunctional ORR and OER activities of the CoSx@srGO/CNT are substantially greater than those of CoS2, srGO, and CoSx@srGO as confirmed by onset potentials, Tafel and K-L plots, and mass activities. Zn-air batteries with CoSx@srGO/CNT catalyst achieved a specific capacity of 583 mAh·gzn−1 and maximum power density of 66.45 mW·cm−2, which are greater than Pt/C and IrO2 mixed catalyst, along with a long-term cyclability of over 100 cycles. The outstanding performance of CoSx@srGO/CNT is attributed to the abundant exposed active sites of CoSx on a unique 3D multidimensional graphene/CNT hybrid architecture and the rapid mass/charge transport for the enhanced bifunctional activities.",Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry
Curved molybdenum dichalcogenide embedding endowed hierarchical graphite oxide nanosheets with robust oxygen reduction electrocatalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The curved structure and hierarchical structure are two effective strategies to improve the efficiency of electrocatalysis. Herein, hierarchical nitrogen-doped curved MoS2 embedded in graphite oxide nanosheets (MoS2-NGO) were developed via a flexible hydrothermal process and followed by nitrogen doping aiming to improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic activity. For the prepared MoS2-NGO, the curved MoS2 with tailored electronic structure can strengthen the mechanical strength of GO nanosheets, promoting the formation of robust hierarchical GO nanosheets, which can accelerate electron/mass transmission for beneficial ORR electrocatalytic process. The optimal MoS2-NGO-10, with a close to four electron reaction pathway, showed sharply enhanced catalytic capability for ORR compared to most reported MoS2 catalysts. As a cathode catalyst, a homemade MoS2-NGO-10-driven zinc air battery (ZAB) delivered a high peak power density of 150 mW cm−2 as well as robust catalytic durability when compared to commercial Pt/C-driven ZAB. This work highlighted the significance of monolithic structure comprising of curved MoS2 and hierarchical GO nanosheets on enhancing the overall electrocatalytic performance for ZAB and other energy conversion systems.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Core-sheath heterostructure of MnCo2O4 nanowires wrapped by NiCo-layered double hydroxide as cathode material for high-performance quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Core-sheath heterostructures composed of MnCo2O4 nanowires wrapped by nanosheets of NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) have been obtained on nickel foam (NF) substrate (MnCo2O4@NiCo-LDH/NF). In which, the MnCo2O4 nanowires play role as core structure, while interconnected NiCo-LDH nanosheets acts as the sheath material. The fabrication is achieved by coupling hydrothermal preparation with electrochemical deposition. This heterostructure combines the advantages of interconnection among NiCo-LDH nanosheets, the high conductivity of MnCo2O4, with excellent mechanical strength and 3D open structure of NF. Benefiting from the core-sheath heterostructures and the interaction among these multi-component, when the MnCo2O4@NiCo-LDH/NF composite is utilized as cathode material for supercapacitors, it delivers a superior specific capacitance of 4555.0 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and maintains a capacitance of 78.7% after 5000 successive charging-discharging cycles using 6M KOH aqueous as electrolyte. In addition, the composite has been used as electrode for assembling the MnCo2O4@NiCo-LDH/NF//AC quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using active carbon (AC) as counter electrode. Such an ASC exhibits an outstanding energy density of 21.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 160.0 W kg−1 and can light up the green LED indicator for more than 30 min, showing promising prospect for practical applications.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

All rights reserved.With the rapid development of modern industry, large amounts of mercury-containing compounds are discharged into the aqueous environment through various ways. Developing advanced technology for divalent mercury ion (Hg2+) removal from water is critical to reduce health risks and ensure ecological safety. As one of the effective water treatment technologies, the adsorptive removal of Hg2+ from aqueous solution has been concerned, and the key to make a breakthrough is to design adsorption materials with excellent performance. In recent years, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been widely used in the environmental remediation because of their high specific surface area, ordered porous structure and facile surface functionalization. Herein, the latest applications of COFs in adsorptive removal of Hg2+ from water are reviewed.

MXene supported transition metal nanoparticles accelerate sulfur reduction reaction kinetics,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryAlthough tremendous efforts have been made to prevent the dissolution of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates in Li-S batteries, the sluggish sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) is still less addressed. Here, we develop a class of MXene-supported transition metal nanoparticle (TMNPs@MXene) composites as highly efficient SRR catalysts for Li-S batteries. The MXene support with high conductivity and high affinity to LiPS can effectively activate TMNP catalysts. TMNPs homogeneously dispersed on MXene sheets are the catalytically active sites for the SRR. Among all TMNPs@MXene composites, the CoNPs@MXene composite exhibits the highest SRR electrocatalytic activity, as confirmed by the fast Li+ diffusion, high Li2S deposition capacity, large electron transfer number, and low activation energy. Consequently, the CoNPs@MXene/S cathode-based Li-S cell exhibits higher capacity and rate capability without obvious capacity decay. Theoretical calculations reveal the moderate LiPS adsorption strength and the low Gibbs energy barrier of the rate-limiting Li2S2/Li2S conversion, which account for the excellent SRR activity of the CoNPs@MXene composite. This novel SRR catalyst provides an opportunity for fabricating long-life and high-energy Li-S batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Stable and high-performance N-micro/mesoporous carbon-supported Pt/Co nanoparticles-GDE for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction in PEMFC,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCThe current research presented a novel type of stable and high-performance electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). For this purpose, N-micro/mesoporous carbon-supported Pt/Co nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized through a two-step procedure. The Co–N-micro/mesoporous carbon support was first prepared by the direct carbonization of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67). Next, the N-micro/mesoporous carbon-supported Pt/Co NPs were synthesized by galvanic replacement of Pt (IV) ions with Co nanoparticles. The surface properties and chemical structure of the prepared electrocatalyst were measured by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) techniques. The results confirmed the desirable properties of the prepared electrocatalyst which enhanced the ORR kinetic. The ORR performance of the prepared electrocatalyst was examined utilizing the catalyst coated membrane electrode (CCME) in the homemade half-cell. The ORR performance of N-micro/mesoporous carbon-supported Pt/Co NPs loaded on the gas diffusion electrode (Pt/Co-NC-GDE) was evaluated in an acidic solution. The electrochemical tests exhibited the superior current density and power density of the Pt/Co-NC-GDE (−58.7 mAcm−2 at 0.3 V/RHE and 17.6 mW cm−2) compared to those of Pt/C-GDE (−43.7 mAcm−2, and 13.1 mW cm−2). Furthermore, durability tests indicated the higher stability of Pt/Co-NC-GDE than Pt/C-GDE.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
One-step reconstruction of acid treated spent graphite for high capacity and fast charging lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdWith the commercialization and popularization of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the resulting massive spent LIBs cause severe concern about environmental pollution. Recently, recycling of metal elements from spent LIBs has been widely explored in industry, but the reuse of spent graphite (SG) anode materials still remains challenging. Herein, a novel regenerated graphite (N-RG) with nitrogen doping and enlarged interlayer spacing is prepared via simultaneous gas-phase exfoliation and element doping with acid treated SG as raw material. N-RG shows excellent rate performance, high capacity, and fast charging performance as LIB anode. Particularly, the capacity maintains 465.8 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 over 200 cycles. Even at a high current density of 4 A g−1, N-RG still possesses a high capacity of 143.5 mA h g−1, about twice as much as commercial graphite (CG). Moreover, the enlarged interlayer spacing induced by exfoliation endows N-RG anode with fast-charging ability in LIBs. This efficient regeneration strategy paves the way to reconstruct spent graphite as high-performance LIB anode material in industrial applications.",Electrochimica Acta
Smart interfaces in Li-ion batteries: Near-future key challenges,"© 2022The recent impressive growth of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) production infrastructures is related to the surge of electric automotive industry. However, the current performance of LIBs is limited by the intrinsic capacity of graphite anodes, the use of organic solvents and by the limited wettability of the separator. In this review, we aim at demonstrating the grade of advance that can be expected for the performances of Li-ion batteries in the short term (roughly, 5–10 years) thanks to introduction of smart materials and interfaces. This temporal limit reflects the need of maintaining the current production chain of LIBs and optimizing the relative investments. In particular, we analyze and discuss the most recent scientific findings on: (i) the solvent, focusing our attention on deep eutectic solvents and ionic liquids (ILs) as an alternative to the currently adopted organic solvents; (ii) tuning the wettability of the separator, thanks to the optimization of the material, its porosity and its surface features; (iii) the anodic materials, according to the different proposed mechanism for Li storage and classifying them into different categories (i.e. carbon-based, Si, perovskites). Finally, we must recognize that, among the so-called “post LIBs” batteries, Li metal batteries can also play a key role in the near future: this type of battery is currently under production for primary cells but requires a smart cathode|electrolyte interface to avoid Li dendrite growth during charge/discharge cycles in their future as secondary systems.",Electrochimica Acta
Multi-cavity carbon nanofiber film decorated with Co-Nx doped CNTs for lithium-sulfur batteries with high-areal-capacity,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The severe shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics are the main challenges in sulfur cathodes, leading to capacity degradation and poor rate performance of lithium-sulfur batteries, especially under high sulfur loading and low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S). Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) multi-cavity carbon nanofiber film decorated with Co-Nx doped carbon nanotubes (Co-NCNTs@CNF) has been designed and endowed with dual functions as the sulfur host and an interlayer simultaneously. The multi-cavity structure of Co-NCNTs@CNF provides enough space for high-loading sulfur and relieves the volume expansion of sulfur. In situ protruded CNTs and CNF form a conductive framework conducive to accelerating the electrons/ions transfer. The macroporous structure caused by the introduction of Co-containing hydrotalcite is beneficial for electrolyte penetration, thereby reducing the E/S. Co-Nx sites can act as high-efficiency adsorbents and catalysts to adsorb polysulfides and catalyze the conversion of polysulfides rapidly. Owing to the synergistic effect, the Co-NCNTs@CNF-0.42-S cathode with an interlayer delivers a high areal capacity of 4.77 mA h cm−2 at 0.2C after 100 cycles under the sulfur loading of 6.7 mg cm−2 and E/S = 10 µL mg−1. This strategy provides a new insight for preparing sulfur cathode materials that can work at low E/S under high sulfur loading.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

Herein, a template and organic solvent-free method was adopted to synthesize Fe, B, and N doped nanoflake-like carbon materials (Fe/B/N–C) by pyrolysis of monoclinic ZIF-8 coated with iron precursors and boric acid. Benefiting from introducing B into Fe–N–C, the regulated electron cloud density of Fe-Nx sites enhance the charge transfer and promotes the ORR process. The as-synthesized Fe/B/N–C electrocatalyst shows excellent ORR activity of a half-wave potential (0.90 V vs 0.87 V of Pt/C), together with superior long-term stability (95.5% current density retention after 27 h) in alkaline media and is even comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (with a half-wave potential of 0.74 V vs 0.82 V of Pt/C) in an acidic electrolyte. A Zn-air battery assembled with Fe/B/N–C as ORR catalyst delivers a higher open-circuit potential (1.47 V), specific capacity (759.9 mA h g−1Zn at 10 mA cm−2), peak power density (62 mW cm−2), as well as excellent durability (5 mA cm−2 for more than 160 h) compared to those with commercial Pt/C. This work provides an effective strategy to construct B doped Fe–N–C materials as nonprecious ORR catalyst. Theoretical calculations indicate that introduction of B could induce Fe-Nx species electronic configuration and is favorable for activation of OH∗ intermediates to promote ORR process.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy

A plasma bombing strategy to synthesize high-loading single-atom catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 The Author(s)Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous attention owing to their unique intrinsic properties, while the facile synthesis, especially the direct transformation of metal salts into single-metal atoms, is still a huge challenge. Here we report a practical approach to access the large-scale synthesis of SACs, in which the metal salts are excited and stripped as mobile single-metal atoms flow under the “plasma bombing” treatment. Simultaneously, they are trapped and anchored by the defective and nitrogenous sites of the supports. More importantly, the synthesis approach is quite general, and it can be extended to the fabrication of various SACs. As an illustration, the prepared SAC-Fe/NC delivers a remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. In combination with the theoretical analysis, an adsorbent-induced spin-crossover ORR mechanism is proposed, and the Fe species coordination with four pyridinic-type N atoms is demonstrated as the main contributor to the high performance of the prepared SAC-Fe/NC.",Cell Reports Physical Science
"Low-temperature water electrolysis: fundamentals, progress, and new strategies","© 2022 RSC.Water electrolysis is a promising technology for sustainable energy conversion and storage of intermittent and fluctuating renewable energy sources and production of high-purity hydrogen for fuel cells and various industrial applications. Low-temperature electrochemical water splitting technologies include alkaline, proton exchange membrane, and anion exchange membrane water electrolyses, which normally consist of two coupled half reactions: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite the advances over decades, formidable challenges still exist and hinder the practical application of large-scale, energy-efficient, and economically viable water electrolysis, including large energy penalty, sluggish kinetics, high cost of precious metal based electrocatalysts, possible H2/O2 gas crossover, difficulty in storage, and distribution of H2. Herein, we first briefly introduce the fundamentals of water electrolysis, summarize the recommended standardized electrochemical characterization protocols, and demonstrate the metrics and key performance indicators that are used to evaluate the performances of HER and OER electrocatalysts and electrolyser cells. Then, we present six new strategies to mitigate the technical challenges in conventional water electrolysis. These emerging strategies for disruptive innovation of water electrolysis technology include overall water electrolysis based on bifunctional nonprecious electrocatalysts (or pre-catalysts), magnetic field-assisted water electrolysis, decoupled water electrolysis, hybrid water electrolysis, acid/alkaline asymmetric electrolyte electrolysis, and tandem water electrolysis. Finally, the remaining challenges, perspectives and future directions are discussed. This review will provide guidance and inspire more endeavours to deepen the mechanistic understanding and advance the development of water electrolysis.",Materials Advances
Entropy Enhanced Perovskite Oxide Ceramic for Efficient Electrochemical Reduction of Oxygen to Hydrogen Peroxide,"© 2022 The Authors. Angewandte Chemie International Edition published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a most promising and efficient route to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), yet the lack of cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalysts have restricted its practical application. Herein, an entropy-enhancement strategy has been employed to enable the low-cost perovskite oxide to effectively catalyze the electrosynthesis of H2O2. The optimized Pb(NiWMnNbZrTi)1/6O3 ceramic is available on a kilogram-scale and displays commendable ORR activity in alkaline media with high selectivity over 91 % across the wide potential range for H2O2 including an outstanding degradation property for organic dyes through the Fenton process. The exceptional performance of this perovskite oxide is attributed to the entropy stabilization-induced polymorphic transformation assuring the robust structural stability, decreased charge mobility as well as synergistic catalytic effects which we confirm using advanced in situ Raman, transient photovoltage, Rietveld refinement as well as finite elemental analysis.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Green and cost-effective synthesis of 2D and 3D graphene-based nanomaterials from Drepanostachyum falcatum for bio-imaging and water purification applications,"© 2022 The Author(s)Herewith, we demonstrate a novel top-down approach for the cost-effective consecutive synthesis of 2D/3D graphene-based materials (GBM) from the extract and fibrous parts of the Drepanostachyum falcatum plant, using a two-stage thermal approach. At low temperature (150 °C), the extract of the D. falcatum showed the formation of a fluorescent 2D skeleton of the GBM i.e., metal-doped graphene oxide sheets (MDGOs) in presence of ethanol. On the other hand, the pyrolysis (∼300 °C) of the fibrous part showed the formation of a 3D skeleton of the graphene nanoribbons (GNR) in the N2 atmosphere. The presence of extensive π-π conjugated interactions with oxidative functional moieties in 2D-MDGOs is responsible for their blue fluorescent nature under UV irradiation at 365 nm. Meanwhile, 2D-MDGOs show excellent potential as a bio-imaging probe for non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells. However, the very low cytotoxicity of 2D-MDGOs played a crucial role in upholding their bio-imaging potential. Simultaneously, the hydrophobic nature of 3D-GNR showed better adsorption towards the organic pollutants (dye) from the aqueous phase. The adsorption phenomenon of 3D-GNR was very fast and effective towards the removal of methylene blue (MB). Moreover, the Langmuir adsorption capacity for MB dye was found to be 31.94 mg/gm. This is the first time we are reporting the dual synthesis of 2D and 3D GBMs simultaneously, with different applicative potentials. Further, noticeable and in-depth observations were made for studying the reaction kinetics of the reaction to find a formal analytical connection between productivity, adsorptive, and applicability of 3D-GNR. Moreover, the market-based-cost analysis showed the huge industrial potential of these materials, which also make them inevitable and promising candidates for futuristic growth in their respective application in water purification.",Chemical Engineering Journal Advances

Fabrication of magnetic dual Z-scheme heterojunction materials for efficient photocatalytic performance: The study of ternary novel MIL-88A(Fe)/BiOBr/SrFe12O19 nanocomposite,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this study, we synthesized the MBSr (MIL-88A(Fe)/BiOBr/SrFe12O19) dual Z-scheme heterojunction via an accessible hydrothermal method and investigated the photocatalytic performance of MBSr composites for Rhodamine B (RhB) and Methylene blue (MB). The MBSr-1% photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance, resulting the degradation rate of RhB reached approximately 96.2% within 60 min, which was higher than that of M88 (34%), BiOBr (89%) and M88/BiOBr-7% (93.7%) composites. And the MBSr-1% could eliminate 90.1% of MB within 90 min, which displayed the best photodegradation efficiency of prepared photocatalysts. The enhanced photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the formation of dual Z-scheme heterojunction, which enhanced visible-light absorption and facilitated the transfer of photoinduced carriers. The MBSr-1% was proved to have excellent stability and reusability after six-recycling run. Furthermore, the major reactive species were h+, •O2− and •OH by radical trapping experiments. Finally, a possible photocatalytic pathway and mechanism of MBSr photocatalysts was proposed.",Separation and Purification Technology
Lithium-ion spontaneous exchange and synergistic transport in ceramic-liquid hybrid electrolytes for highly efficient lithium-ion transfer,"© 2022Ceramic electrolytes are important in ceramic-liquid hybrid electrolytes (CLHEs), which can effectively solve the interfacial issues between the electrolyte and electrodes in solid-state batteries and provide a highly efficient Li-ion transfer for solid–liquid Li metal batteries. Understanding the ionic transport mechanisms in CLHEs and the corresponding role of ceramic electrolytes is crucial for a rational design strategy. Herein, the Li-ion transfer in the ceramic electrolytes of CLHEs was confirmed by tracking the 6Li and 7Li substitution behavior through solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The ceramic and liquid electrolytes simultaneously participate in Li-ion transport to achieve highly efficient Li-ion transfer in CLHEs. A spontaneous Li-ion exchange was also observed between ceramic and liquid electrolytes, which serves as a bridge that connects the ceramic and liquid electrolytes, thereby greatly strengthening the continuity of Li-ion pathways in CLHEs and improving the kinetics of Li-ion transfer. The importance of an abundant solid–liquid interface for CLHEs was further verified by the enhanced electrochemical performance in LiFePO4/Li and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li batteries from the generated interface. This work provides a clear understanding of the Li-ion transport pathway in CLHEs that serves as a basis to build a universal Li-ion transport model of CLHEs.",Science Bulletin
Accelerated degradation of sulfadiazine by nitrogen-doped magnetic biochar-activated persulfate: Role of oxygen vacancy,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Modification using biochar as a carrier is a promising method to improve the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) by magnetic nanoparticles. In this study, we provided an effective strategy to control the generation of oxygen vacancy to prepare N-doped magnetic biochar (NMB) by optimizing the heat treatment process of gas foaming. The NMB exhibited superior catalytic performance and stable recycling use in the activation of PMS to degrade sulfadiazine (SDZ). Through multiple characterization techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the mechanism of the reaction process about oxygen vacancy was explored for the first time in magnetic biochar. In addition, the degradation kinetics, recycling experiment, and removal of total organic carbon were carried out to evaluate the degradation performance of NMB/PMS system. After 15 min of reaction, the removal rate of SDZ reached 95.2%. After the fifth cycle of use, the removal rate of SDZ remained at 79.6%. In addition to SDZ, the NMB/PMS system could also efficiently remove ofloxacin, reactive brilliant red, and bisphenol A, suggesting excellent degradation reactivity for different types of pollutants. The oxygen vacancy was found to play an important role in the catalytic process probably through changing the electronic structure of the NMB catalyst and thereby activating the charge transfer to participate in the degradation. The results from this study might deepen the understanding of the activation mechanism driven by magnetic biochar and provide insights into the development of low-cost wastewater treatment technologies.",Separation and Purification Technology
Regulating Li uniform deposition by lithiophilic interlayer as Li-ion redistributor for highly stable lithium metal batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Although Lithium (Li) metal anode possesses a high theoretical capacity and low redox potential, the poor cycling stability and safety concerns caused by Li dendrites seriously hinder the implementation of Li metal-based batteries. Herein, for the first time, we present a novel interlayer of lithiophilic W2N3 embedded N-doped graphene (WNG) as Li-ion redistributor to effectively adjust and redistribute the interfacial ionic flux. Due to its unique porous nanoarchitecture, WNG nanoflower can guarantee robust mechanical strength, excellent thermal stability and abundant Li deposition sites, meanwhile W2N3 nanoparticles with the abundant polar bonds can offer a strong interaction between Li atom and W2N3 to uniformly regulate the interfacial Li-ion flux thus effectively inhibiting the growth of Li dendrites. DFT calculations further confirms a strong interaction between Li atom and WNG, and the Li ion concentration using WNG/PP is 11.3 times lower than that using bare PP separator. As a result, the lithium metal batteries with WNG interlayer demonstrate dendrite-free and ultra-stable features: the Li//Li symmetric cells show ultralow overpotential (49.6 mV) at ultra-long-term cycling of 2000 h even at 5 mA cm−2 with 1 mAh cm−2; the Li//LiFePO4 full cells exhibit exceptionally ultra-low capacity decay rate of 0.06%/cycle after 300 cycles.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Accurate redox potentials for solvents in Li-metal batteries and assessment of density functionals,"© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.The practical applications of Li metal batteries (LMBs) have been limited by the anodic instability which causes fatal problems including low Coulombic efficiency and short cycling lifespan. One way of addressing this issue is to develop new solvents with suitable redox potentials for electrolytes of LMBs. By using the recently developed Wuhan–Minnesota-scaling method, the work has developed the Redox20 benchmark database consisting of the Ox10 subset of 10 oxidation potentials and the Red10 subset of 10 reduction potentials for four conventional and six fluorinated solvents in LMBs. The performances of 35 DFT methods have been assessed against Redox20. Based on the assessments, M05-2X, M08-HX, M08-SO, M06-2X, and revM06 functionals are the most accurate for the predictions of oxidation potentials, and the N12, M06-HF, M08-HX, HSE06, and PW6B95-D3 functionals are best performers for calculating reduction potentials. M08-HX gives the lowest average mean unsigned error, and it is recommended for the calculation of redox potentials. M08-HX has been employed to calculate the redox potentials and highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital structures of 48 solvents for LMBs, which is beneficial to the selection of optimal LMBs electrolyte solvents.",International Journal of Quantum Chemistry
Cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in iron and nitrogen co-doped urchin-like porous carbons as an efficient bifunctional oxygen reversible catalyst for Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Design of the cheap and high-efficiency catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is imperative for rechargeable Zn-batteries (r-ZABs). Herein, the cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in iron and nitrogen co-doped urchin-like porous carbons (Co@Fe-Nx/C) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER is fabricated via a facile pyrolysis treatment. The Co@Fe-Nx/C catalyst displays a typical urchin-like morphology anchored with numerous CNTs and many monodispersed cobalt nanoparticles are encapsulated in the carbon matrices, which not only enable effective and fast electron transfer, but also can prevent Co nanoparticles from surface oxidation and agglomeration-induced activity degradation, thus improving the electrocatalytic activities and durability. The Co@Fe-Nx/C catalyst exhibits a superb ORR/OER catalytic activities with a low reversible oxygen potential gap (0.67 V), surpassing the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts (0.69 V). Liquid r-ZAB constructed with Co@Fe-Nx/C as the air cathode manifest outstanding energy density (802 mAh g−1), superb charge/discharge performance and excellent reversibility and durability compared to the precious metal couple catalysts. The remarkable bifunctional catalytic activities are due to the synergistic effect of Co nanoparticles and Fe-Nx/C substrates.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Hierarchical hybrid of n-doped carbon sheets-wrapped tungsten oxide nanoparticles for enhanced Li ion storage,"© 2022Herein, we introduce a simple method to construct a hierarchical hybrid (termed as WO3/NC) by wrapping WO3 nanoparticles with nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets which originate from pyrolyzation of folic acid. The as-prepared hybrid presents multihole nanostructures and desirable large surface areas, which are conductive to access of electrolyte and ion diffusion, particle dispersion and alleviation of volume change. Meanwhile, intimate contraction of WO3 nanoparticles with carbon sheets enhances electroconductivity of hybrid and facilitates electron transportation in electrode reaction. Therefore, as a negative electrode for Li ion battery, the electrochemical property of the as-synthesized WO3/NC hybrid is largely boosted. Compared with bare WO3 anode, the hybrid electrode exhibited a higher Li-storage capacity value of 588.2 mAh g−1 with a more stable cycling ability during 150 cycles under 0.1 A g−1. Moreover, at 0.2, 0.5 and 1 A g−1, WO3/NC electrode delivered an enhanced rate capability and the specific capacity could attain 500.5, 385.4 and 239.6 mAh g−1. The vastly promoted electrochemical performance for Li-storage of WO3/NC could be associated with to its advantageous hierarchical architecture and optimized component.",Ceramics International
Excimer ultraviolet-irradiated graphene separator for suppressing polysulfide shuttling in Li–S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are expected to become efficient new-generation energy storage systems owing to their properties such as high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g−1) and high energy density (2600 Wh kg−1). However, some factors restrict their rapid development; for example, the dissolution and migration of polysulfides during the charge and discharge process, extremely poor conductivity of sulfur, and increase in volume. A glass fiber separator with graphene was loaded on a surface modified by excimer ultraviolet light (EUV/graphene separator) as the separator for Li–S batteries. The modified separator was irradiated by excimer ultraviolet light with graphene powder loaded on a glass fiber via vacuum filtration; this can effectively block polysulfide diffusion and improve the utilization rate of active materials when assembled into a Li–S battery. The first discharge specific capacity for this separator was as high as 1164 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C; after 300 cycles, the specific capacity was maintained at 640.5 mAh g−1. This modified separator guarantees the efficient migration of lithium ions and effectively inhibits the shuttle effect of Li–S batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Ni2P nanoparticles-inserted NiFeP nanosheets with rich interfaces as efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of energy materials possessing large number of active sites and exhibiting increased catalytic performance is an important strategy in (electro)catalysis. In this study, Ni2P/NiFeP owning rich interfaces was fabricated within the Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays to form hetero-structured Ni2P/NiFeP catalysts via the Kirkendall effect. The as-prepared catalysts exhibited only 250 mV overpotential towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at + 50 mA cm−2 in alkaline electrolytes, and delivered a current density of + 10 mA cm−2 at 1.57 V in a complete and fully functional water electrolyser using the Ni2P/NiFeP and Ni2P/Ni2P catalysts on the anode and cathode side, respectively. The evolution and reconstruction of the interface in Ni2P/NiFeP during the electrochemical stability test experiments was also studied. It was found that reducing the interface resulted in a decrease in electrocatalytic performance and a transition in crystal structure to amorphous state was observed. The method developed in this investigation has been found to be useful for developing catalysts of rich interfaces, in turns paving the way for integrating novel highly active and stable electrocatalysts in electrochemical water splitting technologies.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Pillared-layer Ni-MOF nanosheets anchored on Ti3C2 MXene for enhanced electrochemical energy storage,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The poor conductivity, unsatisfactory stability and easy aggregation of metal–organic framework (MOF) nanomaterials have been recognized as the main reasons that prevent their practical application. Here, we report the highly conductive and cyclic-stable Ti3C2 MXene@pillared-layer [Ni(thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate)(4,4′-bipyridine)]n MOF composites (MXene@Ni-MOF). Based on the hard-soft-acid-base principle, the pillared-layer Ni-MOF porous structure with Ni-N coordination bonds confer better structural stability. The Ni-MOF nanosheets are immobilized by the MXene, leading to fast charge transfer between the Ni-MOF and MXene, solving the problem of poor conductivity of Ni-MOF, while avoiding the agglomeration of Ni-MOF nanosheets. Moreover, the strong interaction between the organic ligands of Ni-MOF and surface functional groups of MXene plays a key role: it reduces the exposure of surface groups of MXene, limits the oxidation of MXene, and increases its layer spacing, thus facilitating the rapid ion transport. The MXene@Ni-MOF exhibits a high specific capacitance (979 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and the new aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor device displays an excellent cycling property with only 2% decay after 5000 cycles.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Core-Shell ZIF-67@ZIF-8-derived multi-dimensional cobalt-nitrogen doped hierarchical carbon nanomaterial for efficient oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Fuel cells have emerged as a charming candidate for next-generation energy conversion devices. However, it is highly desired but challenging to engineer advanced non-precious oxygen reduction catalysts with highly actives and stability due to the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on fuel cell cathode. Herein, a novel hybrid architecture with Co nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanotubes and hollow nanocarbon polyhedron (Co@N-CNT-HC) was constructed from core-shell ZIF-67@ZIF-8 via a facile epitaxial growth-pyrolysis process. With the Co@N-CNT-HC as the catalyst, a remarkable ORR performance is achieved in terms of a high half-wave potential of 0.84 V, a large limiting current density of 4.70 mA/cm2, and excellent long-term durability ( 97.8% current retention after 8 h) in alkaline medium, which outperform commercial Pt/C catalyst. Further dynamic calculations indicated that ORR follows a four-electron reaction mechanism. The enhancement activity of Co@N-CNT-HC is mainly due to the effective integration of 0D Co nanoparticles, 1D carbon nanotubes and 3D hollow nanocarbon, which synergistically strengthen the interfacial reaction kinetics of oxygen and accelerate mass/charge transfer. The strategy reported in this work provides a new insight to synthesis of low-cost and well-designed carbon hybrid electrocatalyst for ORR.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution: Orbital redistribution of ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets via atomic defects,"© 2021Defect engineering, inducing photo-excited electrons and holes to different surfaces of semiconductor photocatalyst, is an efficient strategy to improve the photocatalytic activity. A rapid heating-up hydrothermal technique is developed to regulate ZnIn2S4 crystal growth, then, ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with In defect-rich [InS]6 interlayer but perfect [InS]4 and [ZnS]4 surface layers are successfully prepared (ultra-ZIS-VIn). Interestingly, the In defect, inducing the redistribution of the orbitals near the valence band maximum, separates the oxidation and reduction sites on the opposite sides of the ultra-ZIS-VIn nanosheets. Simultaneously, In defects increase the density of states (near the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum) and delocalize the electron around In defects. Accordingly, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate is optimized to 13.4 mmol h−1 g−1, which is 8.9 times higher than that of defect-free ZnIn2S4 (pristine-ZIS).",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
CoP nanorods anchored on Ni2P-NiCoP nanosheets with abundant heterogeneous interfaces boosting the electrocatalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethyl-furfural,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The transformation of biomass-derived platform molecules (such as 5-hydroxymethyl-furfural (HMF)) represents a renewable route to produce value-added chemicals and fuels. Herein, we report the design and fabrication of coralline-like CoP/Ni2P-NiCoP@NC materials composed of multiple metal phosphides embedded in N-doped carbon for efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Systematic characterization indicates that the materials possess strong electronic coupling between the abundant heterogeneous interfaces (i.e., CoP, Ni2P and NiCoP). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results further suggest that the heterogeneous interfaces in CoP/Ni2P-NiCoP@NC can regulate the d-band centers of Co and Ni to approach the Fermi level, thus strengthening the electronic interaction at the reaction interfaces and minimizing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step for HMF electro-oxidation. Consequently, the optimal CoP/Ni2P-NiCoP@NC-600 exhibits excellent HMF oxidation activity with an ultralow potential of 1.32 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH, affording 98.1% FDCA yield and 97.6% Faradaic efficiency (FE) as well as robust cycling durability.",Catalysis Science and Technology
Transition metal decorated phthalocyanine as a potential host material for lithium polysulfides: a first-principles study,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe shuttle effect caused by the soluble long-chain lithium polysulfides greatly hinders the practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Therefore, the introduction of suitable anchoring materials is more effective to mitigate this problem. Transition metal phthalocyanines (TMPc) are regarded as a new class of sulfur host materials. Here, 4d transition metal (Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd) decorated phthalocyanines are designed and systematically researched for the performance analysis of anchoring S8/LiPSs by first-principles calculations. The results reveal that the bonding strength of LiPSs can be well adjusted by introducing suitable 4d transition metals into the phthalocyanine structure. The electronic structure analysis indicates the formation of TM-S bonds between the TMPc substrate materials and the LiPSs, which is essential to weaken the Li-S bonds and hence slow down the shuttle effect of LiPSs. ZrPc and NbPc both exhibit excellent potential and thermal stability for facilitating the conversion of LiPSs, as well as a better promoting effect for the sulfur reduction reactions (SRR) with a reduced Gibbs free energy in the rate-determining step (*Li2S2 → *Li2S) during the discharge reaction process. These findings in our work may encourage further experimental and theoretical research for anchoring LiPSs with TMPc as a host material.",RSC Advances

Recently, synthesized triphenylene based two-dimensional conductive metal organic frameworks (2D MOFs) have been observed to hold promising characteristics to overcome the limitations with suitable pore and anchoring sites along with the desired electron conductivity. In this study, we use density functional theory calculations to investigate 2D honeycomb MOFs with hexa-substituted triphenylene linkers with pairs of varying metal ions (Cu, Ni, and Co) and functional groups (N, O, and S) (M3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (M3(HITP)2), M3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (M3(HOTP)2) and M3(triphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexathiol)2 (M3(THT)2)) to be the potential cathode hosts in Li-S batteries and analyse their structure-activity relationship. The detailed study of structural-electronic characteristics followed by analysis of the triangle of catalytic activity concludes that M3(HOTP)2 can deliver higher anchoring efficiency, but it suffers from low redox reactivity with high Li diffusion and Li2S decomposition barriers, whereas M3(HITP)2 MOFs appear insubstantial with the possibility of Li polysulfide shuttling due to the lower anchoring. Co3(THT)2 not only has superior anchoring efficiency (−1.40 to −2.68 eV) but also shines in terms of facile Li+ diffusion (0.68 eV), a small Gibbs free energy requirement of 0.68 eV for Li polysulfide reduction and a moderately low Li2S decomposition barrier (1.06 eV) that simultaneously contribute to the performance of Li-S batteries. Our study concludes that the combination of Co and S in Co3(THT)2 makes the most suitable cathode host and provides a basis for the designing and screening of new materials having such active components to achieve high performance Li-S batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Enhanced catalysis of radical-to-polysulfide interconversion via increased sulfur vacancies in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is seriously hindered by severe lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling and sluggish electrochemical conversions. Herein, the Co9S8/MoS2 heterojunction as a model cathode host material is employed to discuss the performance improvement strategy and elucidate the catalytic mechanism. The introduction of sulfur vacancies can harmonize the chemisorption of the heterojunction component. Also, sulfur vacancies induce the generation of radicals, which participate in a liquidus disproportionated reaction to reduce the accumulation of liquid LiPSs. To assess the conversion efficiency from liquid LiPSs to solid Li2S, a new descriptor calculated from basic cyclic voltammetry curves, nucleation transformation ratio, is proposed.",Chemical Science

Self-supported Film Electrodes Decorated with Single Atoms for Energy Electrocatalysis 自支撑单原子膜电极在能源电催化中的应用,"© 2022, Editorial Department of Chem. J. Chinese Universities. All right reserved.Single-atom catalysts(SACs) have been widely studied in energy electrocatalysis due to their high catalytic activity, excellent selectivity and maximized atom utilization efficiency. However, the powdery SACs were mostly evaluated at small current densities(typically<100 mA/cm2) with low electrode loading(typically<1.0 mg/cm2) due to the complex preparation process of the working electrode, the addition of polymeric binder that would decrease the electrical conductivity and bury the active sites. In contrast, self-supported single-atom film electrodes not only possess the merits of SACs, but also have the advantages of monolithic structure, such as the omission of polymeric and conductive additives, improved electrical conductivity, enhanced exposure of single-atom sites and adjustable morphology and porosity, making them highly promising to be applied in high-current-density catalytic reactions and high-energy/power-density batteries. In this review, the recent advances of self-supported film-based SACs in energy electrocatalysis are presented. Firstly, the advantages of self-supported film-based SACs are discussed. Sub- sequently, their synthetic approaches are summarized, including in situ preparation on a self-supported substrate, electrostatic spinning, self-assembly, chemical vapor deposition and solid phase diffusion. Then, the applications of self-supported film-based SACs in various energy-related electrocatalytic processes are introduced, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, H2O2 electrosynthesis, zinc-air batteries, carbon dioxide reduction reaction and lithium sulfur batteries. Finally, the development direction of self-supported film-based SACs is prospected.",Gaodeng Xuexiao Huaxue Xuebao/Chemical Journal of Chinese Universities

Progress in the use of organic potassium salts for the synthesis of porous carbon nanomaterials: microstructure engineering for advanced supercapacitors,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryPorous carbon nanomaterials (PCNs) are widely applied in energy storage devices. Traditionally, PCNs were mainly synthesized by activation and templating methods, which are time-consuming, tedious, corrosive and relatively high cost. Therefore, the development of easier and greener methods to produce PCNs is of great significance. Recently, organic potassium salts (OPSs) emerged as versatile reagents for synthesizing PCNs. The OPS-based synthesis of PCNs can avoid the use of large amounts of corrosive chemical agents. Potassium carbonate generated in situ from the decomposition of OPSs could serve as both a green activation agent and a water-removable template to produce nanopores. Potassium oxide and potassium formed at higher temperature could generate additional porosity, contributing to a highly porous architecture. The carbon-rich organic moiety could function as a carbon precursor and chemical blowing agent. This review aims to elucidate the multifunctionality of OPSs in the synthesis of PCNs and the capacitive performance of the corresponding PCNs. To this end, recent progress on the capacitive performance of PCNs synthesized from OPSs is summarized. This review provides constructive viewpoints for the cost-effective and green synthesis of PCNs with the aid of OPSs for application in supercapacitors.",Nanoscale
A graphene oxide scaffold-encapsulated microcapsule for polysulfide-immobilized long life lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryEngineering high-performance cathodes for high energy-density lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is quite significant to achieve commercialization. Here, we develop a graphene oxide scaffold/sulfur composite-encapsulated microcapsule (GSM) for high-performance Li-S batteries, which is prepared through the co-flow focusing (CFF) approach. The GSM-based cathode displays a high capacity of 1004 mA h g−1 at 0.2C after cycling 200 times, a long-term cycling stability after 1000 cycles at 2C, and a good rate-performance. At temperatures of −5 °C and 45 °C, the electrochemical performance is also excellent. The computational calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) verify the high adsorption energies of the microcapsules towards polysulfides, suppressing the shuttle effect efficiently.

Ni doping carbon skin on SiOx surface to promote the formation of graphitic-N and graphite microcrystals for stable Li storage,"© 2022Carbon coating is an effective way to solve the structural disintegration problem associated with silicon-based anodes. Although N-doped carbon can increase the number of lithium storage active sites and promote local charge transfer, the decrease of order degree often leads to the decline of electronic conductivity and structural stability during long-term cycling. In this paper, the formation of graphitic N-doped active sites and graphite microcrystals are promoted by the introduction of nickel composites, which effectively improve the conductivity of the carbon skin and the uniform distribution of charge transfer on the carbon skin. Particularly, the order degree of the carbon layer further improves the stability of electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The sample with a suitable amount of Ni sources shows a satisfactory electrochemical performance among samples with different amounts of nickel source introduced. Specifically, the specific capacity of 667.1 mAh g−1 can be maintained after 2000 cycles at 0.5 A g−1, and the capacity retention ratio is up to 77.6%.

All rights reserved.As a group of large-surface-area nonmetal materials, polymeric carbon nitride (CxNy) and its hybrid structures are nowadays of ever-increasing interest for use in energy devices involved in energy conversion and storage, offering low expenses and facile production processes. With the growing requirement for clean and renewable energy generation and storage systems, progress in the replacement of expensive noble-metal catalysts with CxNy-based materials as efficient electrocatalysts has expanded considerably, and the demand for these materials has increased.

Immobilization of Iron Phthalocyanine on Pyridine-Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes for Efficient Nitrogen Reduction Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.An electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under mild conditions offers a promising alternative to the traditional Haber-Bosch process in converting abundant nitrogen (N2) to high value-added ammonia (NH3). In this work, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) was homogeneously immobilized on pyridine-functionalized carbon nanotubes to form a well-tuned electrocatalyst with an FeN5active center (FePc-Py-CNT). Synchrotron X-ray absorption and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy proved the presence of an Fe-N coordination bond between FePc and surface-bound pyridine. The resulting hybrid exhibited notably enhanced electrocatalytic NRR performance compared to FePc immobilized on CNTs based on π-πstacking interactions (FePc-CNT), resulting in doubled NH3yield (21.7 μg mgcat-1h-1) and Faradaic efficiency (22.2%). Theoretical calculations revealed that the axial coordination on FePc resulted in partial electron transfer from iron to pyridine, which efficiently suppresses the adsorption of H+and improves the chemisorption of N2at Fe sites. Meanwhile, the interfacial electron transfer was facilitated by pyridine as an electron transfer relay between FePc and CNTs. This work provides a unique strategy for the design of highly efficient NRR electrocatalysts at the molecular level.",ACS Catalysis
Design of Photoactive Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogeneous Catalyst for Preparation of Thiophosphinates from Phosphine Oxides and Thiols,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Two new covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized from 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(pyrene-1,3,6,8-tetrayl)tetraaniline and 2,5-dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (Py-DMTA-COF) or 2′,5′-dimethoxy-[1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl]-4,4′′-dicarbaldehyde (Py-DMTPDA-COF) under solvothermal conditions. These two COFs were further facilely developed as efficient photocatalytic platforms for the synthesis of thiophosphinates. Py-DMTA-COF exhibited better photocatalytic activity, broad substrate applicability, and excellent recycling capacity for the preparation of thiophosphinates from P(O)H compounds and thiols compared to Py-DMTPDA-COF. This methodology was further extended to the seamless gram-scale production of target phosphorothioate derivatives.

Accelerating hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production kinetics with Mn dopant modulated CoS2 nanowire arrays,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryElectrochemical H2 production from water splitting is an environmentally sustainable technique but remains a great challenge due to the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Replacing the OER with the thermodynamically more favorable electrocatalytic oxidation process is an effective strategy for highly efficient H2 generation. Herein, Mn-doped CoS2 has predicted an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). With the introduction of Mn, the Gibbs free energy of the adsorbed H* and the potential rate-limiting step (the dehydrogenation of *NH2NH2 to *NHNH2) for the HzOR process of the catalyst can be significantly reduced. As expected, the Mn-CoS2 catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity and robust long-term stability for the HER and HzOR. In detail, the Mn-CoS2 catalyst only acquired potentials of 46 and 77 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode for achieving a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the cathodic HER and anodic HzOR, respectively. In addition, the Mn-CoS2 electrode only needs a cell voltage of 447 mV to output 200 mA cm−2 in the overall hydrazine splitting system as well as exhibits a robust long-term H2 production. This work provides theoretical guidance for the design of advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts and promotes high efficiency and energy-saving H2 production technology.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers
Co/Fe3O4 nanoparticles embedded in N-doped hierarchical porous carbon derived from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalysts for zinc-air battery-based desalination,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Zinc-air battery-based desalination (ZABD) is a potential solution to effectively desalinate brackish water and supply energy simultaneously, which requires catalysts with high and durable electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode of zinc-air batteries. Herein, a N-doped hierarchically porous carbon material encapsulating Co/Fe3O4 nanoparticles was successfully prepared using zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) as the precursor. Due to the integration of large specific surface area, hierarchically porous structure, and Co/Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the Co/Fe3O4@ZIF-8C catalyst exhibits a limiting current density of 5.93 mA cm−2 and a half-wave potential of 0.83 V, which is comparable to that of commercial platinum/carbon (Pt/C). It also presents outstanding durability and methanol endurance, superior to the Pt/C catalyst. More importantly, Co/Fe3O4@ZIF-8C achieved the dual functions of a fast salt removal rate (32.9 μg cm−2 min−1) and high energy output (91.6 KJ mol−1) when employed as the cathode catalyst of ZABD, which can process brine of 3000 ppm to a drinking water level of 128 ppm. The employment of Co/Fe3O4@ZIF-8C enables ZABD to possess stable batch cyclability and durable desalination performance. This is the first time that a non-noble metal catalyst has been applied in ZABD, realizing an outstanding desalination performance comparable to that of commercial Pt/C. Accordingly, the high-efficiency and low-cost ORR catalytic material provided by this work has significant application prospects in seawater desalination and metal-air discharge batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Electrocatalytic water oxidation performance in an extended porous organic framework with a covalent alliance of distinct Ru sites,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe rational synthesis of durable, earth-abundant efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water is one of the most important routes for storing renewable energy and minimizing fossil fuel combustion. The prime hurdles for effectively utilizing commercial RuO2 as (OER) electrocatalysts are its very low stability, catalyst deactivation, and high cost. In this work, we explored a Ru-integrated porous organic polymer (Ru@Bpy-POP) by a facile one-pot Friedel-Crafts alkylation strategy between redox-active (Ru(demob)3Cl2) and a carbazole unit, which is composed of unique features including an extended framework unit, isolated active sites, and tunable electrode kinetics. Ru@Bpy-POP can serve as a bridge between a Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) and POP-based catalytic systems with a balanced combination of covalent bonds (structural stability) and open metal sites (single site catalysis). Ru@Bpy-POP, deposited on a three-dimensional nickel foam electrode support, exhibits a promising electrocatalytic OER activity with an ultra-low ruthenium loading compared to a benchmark RuO2 catalyst, providing an overpotential of about 270 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 in an alkaline medium. Moreover, a high current density of 248 mA cm−2 was achieved for the Ru@Bpy-POP catalyst at only 1.6 V (vs. RHE), which is much higher than 91 mA cm−2 for commercial RuO2. The robust, albeit highly conjugated, POP framework not only triggered facile electro-kinetics but also suppressed aggregation and metallic corrosion during electrolysis. In particular, the benefits of covalent integration of distinct Ru sites into the framework can modulate intermediate adsorption and charge density, which contributes to its exceptional OER activity. All of the critical steps involved in OER are complemented by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest that electrocatalytic water oxidation proceeds from a closed-shell configuration to open-shell electronic configurations with high-spin states. These open-shell configurations are more stable than their closed-shell counterparts by 1 eV, improving the overall catalytic activity.",Nanoscale
Systematically theoretical investigation the effect of nitrogen and iron-doped graphdiyne on the oxygen reduction reaction mechanism in proton exchange membrane fuel cells,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCDeveloping economical electrocatalysts as alternatives to platinum for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to develop the applications of green energy devices like proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is of paramount importance. In the current study, a different ratio of nitrogen-doped graphdiyne (GDY) with Fe single-site is reported to be more cost-effective and efficient for PEMFCs. The current study also demonstrates the design principle to improve the ORR activity associated with catalysts using Fe single-site with a greater Fe charge, which is controlled through the coordinated structure of the active center. Based on the simulation results, the formation of N2-doped GDY and N2-doepd Fe-GDY are more lucrative compared to the formation of Nx-doped GDY (x > 2) in terms of energy. O2 molecules have a direct dissociation on the N2-doepd Fe-GDY via Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanism, which involves the formation of H2O by reacting with H+ from the electrolyte. Moreover, N2-doepd Fe-GDY exhibits better performance as an ORR catalyst in an acidic medium because of its low overpotential of 0.488 V. However, N2-doped GDY follows the OOH∗ formation pathway, showing a higher overpotential for ORR. Furthermore, in the structure under study, the thermodynamic favorability of ORR is observed since the reaction energies calculated at each reaction step are exothermic and the energy profile of all reaction steps are downhill. The results of the current work provide new insights into the construction of extremely efficient heterogeneous catalysts in electrochemical energy technologies.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
Controlled synthesis of NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF on Ni foam as efficient electrocatalyst for urea oxidation reaction and oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCHeterostructured materials with special interfaces and features give a unique character for much electrocatalytic process. In this work, the introduction of exogenous modifier Ni-MOF improved the reaction kinetics and morphology of the NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF/NF catalyst. As-obtained NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF/NF has excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance. The catalyst need overpotential of 340 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm−2 for OER and a potential of 1.31 V at the same current density for UOR. The Tafel slopes of NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF/NF is 38.34 and 15.33 mV dec−1 for OER and UOR respectively, which is more superior than 78.58 and 66.73 mV dec−1 of NiCo2O4/NF. The nanosheets microstructure is beneficial to the adsorption and transport of electrolyte and the presence of a large number of mesoporous channels can also accelerate gas release, and then improves activity of the catalyst. Density functional theory calculation demonstrate that NiCo2O4 plays a role in absorbing water, while the existence of in situ generated NiOOH can promote the electron transfer efficiency. It is synergies of NiCo2O4 and in situ generated NiOOH that enhance the decomposition of water on the surface of the NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF/NF. This investigation provides a new strategy for the application of spinel oxide and MOF materials.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
One-pot synthesis of nanosized MnO incorporated into N-doped carbon nanosheets for high performance lithium storage,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.As potential anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, transition metal oxides have been extensively investigated due to their high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, how to address rapid capacity degradation and improve rate capability is still a big challenge. Herein, nanosized MnO incorporated into N-doped carbon nanosheets (MnO/NCN) was rationally designed by a facile one-pot salt-templated synthesis method. The nanosized MnO particles (around 20 nm) were powerfully anchored on the ultrathin N-doped carbon nanosheets to build a high-efficiency electrons/ions hybrid conductive framework. In addition, based on the stable interfacial interaction between MnO and N-doped carbon nanosheets, the MnO/NCN hybrid exhibits great structural stability, thus delivering high reversible lithium storage capacity (719 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1) and superior stability (497 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 1000 cycles). Besides, the assembled lithium-ion capacitor with MnO/NCN anode exhibits excellent energy-power characteristics (142 W h kg−1 at 412 W kg−1). Such impressive lithium storage performance demonstrates that the MnO/NCN electrode is promising for large-scale energy storage devices.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Promoting polysulfide redox kinetics by tuning the non-metallic p-band of Mo-based compounds,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.In spite of their high energy density, the application of Li-S batteries is still held back by the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. Herein, we load a series of Mo-based compounds (i.e., MoO2, MoS2, MoN and MoP) on mesoporous carbon nanosheets to modify the separator of Li-S batteries, and systematically study the kinetic behaviors of polysulfides on these separators. We demonstrate that the battery using the MoP-modified separator exhibits the best electrochemical performance because of the narrower energy gap between the metal 3d- and anion 2p-band centers than other compounds. Both experiments and calculations confirm that the narrow energy gap can efficiently lower the decomposition barriers of Li2S. Accordingly, the battery with the MoP-modified separator exhibits a high rate and long life. In particular, owing to the improved kinetics, this battery can be cycled at −40 °C with a high capacity (391.0 mA h g−1) and a promising stability (capacity retention of 89.6% over 100 cycles).",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

The result is reticular nanoscience, an area of reticular chemistry that has an immense potential in virtually any technological field. In this perspective, we explore the extension of such an interdisciplinary reach by surveying the explored and unexplored possibilities that framework nanoparticles can offer. We localize these unique nanosized reticular materials at the juncture between the molecular and the macroscopic worlds, and describe the resulting synthetic and analytical chemistry, which is fundamentally different from conventional frameworks. Such differences are mirrored in the properties that reticular nanoparticles exhibit, which we described while referring to the present state-of-the-art and future promising applications in medicine, catalysis, energy-related applications, and sensors. Finally, the bottom-up approach of reticular nanoscience, inspired by nature, is brought to its full extension by introducing the concept of augmented reticular chemistry. Its approach departs from a single-particle scale to reach higher mesoscopic and even macroscopic dimensions, where framework nanoparticles become building units themselves and the resulting supermaterials approach new levels of sophistication of structures and properties.",Journal of the American Chemical Society

Approaches to Combat the Polysulfide Shuttle Phenomenon in Li–S Battery Technology,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Lithium–sulfur battery (LSB) technology has tremendous prospects to substitute lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology due to its high energy density. However, the escaping of polysulfide intermediates (produced during the redox reaction process) from the cathode structure is the primary reason for rapid capacity fading. Suppressing the polysulfide shuttle (PSS) is a viable solution for this technology to move closer to commercialization and supersede the established LIB technology. In this review, we have analyzed the challenges faced by LSBs and outlined current methods and materials used to address these problems. We conclude that in order to further pioneer LSBs, it is necessary to address these essential features of the sulfur cathode: superior electrical conductivity to ensure faster redox reaction kinetics and high discharge capacity, high pore volume of the cathode host to maximize sulfur loading/utilization, and polar PSS-resistive materials to anchor and suppress the migration of polysulfides, which can be developed with the use of nanofabrication and combinations of the PSS-suppressive qualities of each component. With these factors addressed, our world will be able to forge ahead with the development of LSBs on a larger scale—for the efficiency of energy systems in technology advancement and potential benefits to outweigh the costs and performance decay.",Batteries

"Three dimensional self-supporting Co, N, S co-doped porous carbon derived from paulownia wood for Li-O2 batteries 锂-氧气电池用泡桐木衍生三维自支撑Co、N、S共掺杂多孔炭","© 2022, Editorial Board of CIESC Journal. All right reserved.Lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries are considered as the most promising new generation energy storage devices because of their high theoretical energy density and environmental friendliness. However, large overpotential, low practical energy density and poor cycle life are the huge obstacles to their practical application. Since the insoluble and insulating discharge products (Li2O2) gradually form on the surface or in the pores of cathode during the discharging process, these products will block the diffusion channel of O2/electrolyte and cover the catalytic active sites. In addition, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) require noble-metal-based materials as catalyst to reduce the overpotential and achieve high electrochemcial efficiency. However, high cost and scarcity of the noble-metal catalysts hinder their large scale applications. Development of economically viable and highly efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts is extremely urgent, especially for heteroatom-doped carbons as the most promising candidates. In this paper, a novel Co, N and S co-doped three-dimensional self-standing porous carbon (wd-NSC) was prepared as cathode for Li-O2 battery using melamine and thiourea as nitrogen and sulfur sources via one-step pyrolysis of paulownia wood in NaCl/CoCl2 mixed molten salt medium. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results found that the wd-NSC inherited the original vertical channel structure of paulownia wood, and formed porous carbon fiber network on the surface and inside the channels of wd-NSC. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that N and S were successfully doped into the C skeleton, while Co might exist in the form of single atom or clusters. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms showed that the wd-NSC possess hierarchical porous structure with pore sizes ranging from micropore to macropore. Raman spectra certified that the introduction of S increased the defect degree of wd-NSC. At a current density of 0.05mA/cm2, the discharge specific capacity of wd-NSC reached to 12.83mA·h/cm2, and exhibited a good rate capability and cycling stability (at a current density of 0.1mA/cm2 and a limited capacity of 0.5mA·h/cm2, the cell can maintain 125 cycles). The excellent electrochemical performance of wd-NSC in the Li-O2 battery could be attributed to the synergistic effect of three-dimensional hierarchical porous structure and Co, N, S heteroatoms co-doping. The above results demonstrated that this study provided a promising strategy to produce efficiency and low-cost cathodes for practical application in Li-O2 batteries.",Huagong Jinzhan/Chemical Industry and Engineering Progress

Ultrapermeable 2D-channeled graphene-wrapped zeolite molecular sieving membranes for hydrogen separation,"Copyright © 2022 The Authors,The efficient separation of hydrogen from methane and light hydrocarbons for clean energy applications remains a technical challenge in membrane science. To address this issue, we prepared a graphene-wrapped MFI (G-MFI) molecular-sieving membrane for the ultrafast separation of hydrogen from methane at a permeability reaching 5.8 × 106 barrers at a single gas selectivity of 245 and a mixed gas selectivity of 50. Our results set an upper bound for hydrogen separation. Efficient molecular sieving comes from the subnanoscale interfacial space between graphene and zeolite crystal faces according to molecular dynamic simulations.

Lithium-Rich Rock Salt Type Sulfides-Selenides (Li2 TiSex S3−x): High Energy Cathode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Lithium-rich disordered rocksalt Li2 TiS3 offers large discharge capacities (>350 mAh·g−1) and can be considered a promising cathode material for high-energy lithium-ion battery applications. However, the quick fading of the specific capacity results in a poor cycle life of the system, especially when liquid electrolyte-based batteries are used. Our efforts to solve the cycling stability problem resulted in the discovery of new high-energy selenium-substituted materials (Li2 TiSex S3−x), which were prepared using a wet mechanochemistry process. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that all compositions were obtained in cation-disordered rocksalt phase and that the lattice parameters were expanded by selenium substitution. Substituted materials delivered large reversible capacities, with smaller average potentials, and their cycling stability was superior compared to Li2 TiS3 upon cycling at a rate of C/10 between 3.0–1.6 V vs. Li+ /Li.",Materials
Sucrose-based sol-gel synthesis of microporous titanium carbide as target material for the production of radioisotopes,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.An environment-friendly route for the synthesis of titanium carbide by sol-gel processing is reported. The initial solution is prepared via a simple one-pot approach, using titanium isopropoxide and sucrose as molecular precursors under acidic conditions, therefore promoting intimate interactions between the networks of sucrose and of the titanium alkoxide-derived inorganic polymer at the molecular level. Furthermore, the usage of sucrose represents an established and green solution, and provides a viable alternative to the use of toxic compounds. The resulting gels are dried at 120 °C and then undergo carbothermal reduction in Ar atmosphere at different temperatures ranging from 700 °C to 1750 °C. A systematic study of the obtained material is carried out by using FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, N2 physisorption and He pycnometry. The characterization techniques show that the sucrose-derived titanium carbide exhibits a tailored microporous structure and larger specific surface area values compared with those of materials produced using the hazardous phenolic resin-based system. This method thus allows the synthesis of titanium carbide with exquisite textural properties and attractive porous architectures, meeting the requirements for the fabrication of target materials in the field of nuclear medicine, with particular interest in the production and release of scandium radioisotopes.",Microporous and Mesoporous Materials
Atomic/Molecular Layer Deposition for Designer's Functional Metal–Organic Materials,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Materials Interfaces published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Atomic layer deposition (ALD) for high-quality conformal inorganic thin films is one of the cornerstones of modern microelectronics, while molecular layer deposition (MLD) is its less-exploited counterpart for purely organic thin films. Currently, the hybrid of these two techniques, i.e., ALD/MLD, is strongly emerging as a state-of-the-art gas-phase route for designer's metal–organic thin films, e.g., for the next-generation energy technologies. The ALD/MLD literature comprises nearly 300 original journal papers covering most of the alkali and alkaline earth metals, 3d transition metals, and lanthanides as the metal component and a variety of aliphatic, aromatic, and natural organic components. Some of these ALD/MLD processes yield in situ crystalline coordination-polymer- or metal–organic-framework-like structures. Another attractive aspect is that many of the metal–organics realized through ALD/MLD are fundamentally new materials, and even unaccessible through conventional synthesis. Here, the current state of research in the field is presented, by i) providing a comprehensive account of the ALD/MLD processes so far developed, ii) addressing the constraints/possibilities for growing in situ crystalline metal–organic films, iii) highlighting some intriguing ALD/MLD materials and their application potential, and iv) making a brief outlook to the future perspectives and challenges in the field.",Advanced Materials Interfaces
"Hierarchical Core–Shell Co2N/CoP Embedded in N, P-doped Carbon Nanotubes as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts for Zn-air Batteries","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Projecting a cost-effective and highly efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen reaction reduction (ORR) counts a great deal for Zn-air batteries. Herein, a hierarchical core–shell ORR catalyst (Co2N/CoP@PNCNTs) is developed by embedding cobalt phosphides and/or cobalt nitrides as the core into N, P-doped carbon nanotubes (PNCNTs) as the shell via one-step carbonization, nitridation, and phosphorization of pyrolyzing Co-MOF precursor. The globally N, P-doped structure of Co2N/CoP@PNCNTs demonstrates an outstanding electrocatalytic activity in the alkaline solution with the onset and half-wave potentials of 1.07 and 0.85 V respectively. Moreover, a Zn-air battery assembled from Co2N/CoP@PNCNTs as the air cathode delivers an open circuit potential of 1.49 V, a maximum power density of 151.1 mW cm−2 and a specific capacity of 823.8 mAh kg−1. It is reflected that Co2N/CoP@PNCNTs provides a long-term durability with a slight decline of 15 h in the chronoamperometry measurement and an excellent charge–discharge stability with negligible voltage decay for 150 h at 10 mA cm−2 in Zn-air batteries. The results reveal that Co2N/CoP@PNCNTs has superiority over most Co-Nx-C or CoxP@C catalysts reported so far. The excellent catalytic properties and stability of Co2N/CoP@PNCNTs derive from synergistic effects between Co2N/CoP and mesoporous N, P-doped carbon nanotubes.",Small
Li2S4 Anchoring Governs the Catalytic Sulfur Reduction on Defective SmMn2O5 in Lithium–Sulfur Battery,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The introduction of sulfur redox electrocatalysts has been considered to be an effective strategy to anchor polysulfides on the cathode and reduce the energy barriers of the reactions. Due to the complexity of sulfur redox reactions (SRR/SER), there exist few descriptors to correlate the catalytic performance and the underlying electronic structures of a given catalyst, which inhibits the development of lithium−sulfur catalysts. In this article, upon mullite oxide SmMn2O5 with various substitutional defects, density functional theory calculations are used to probe the structure–property relationships. It is found that there exists no scaling relationship among the polysulfide binding energies, indicating that the catalytic performance can be tuned by a key intermediate individually. Statistical analysis of various models with different S-containing intermediates shows that only the Li2S4 binding energy has a linear correlation with the overpotential, showing the dominant role of Li2S4 anchoring to determine the catalytic performance. The electronic structure analysis combined with machine learning further quantitatively verifies the coeffect of charge transfer, electronegativity, and work function on the binding strength of the polysulfide Li2S4. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the complex SRR/SER mechanisms and sheds light on the rational design of a sulfur redox catalyst.",Advanced Energy Materials
Highly Loaded Independent Pt0 Atoms on Graphdiyne for pH-General Methanol Oxidation Reaction,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.The emergence of platinum-based catalysts promotes efficient methanol oxidation reactions (MOR). However, the defects of such noble metal catalysts are high cost, easy poisoning, and limited commercial applications. The efficient utilization of a low-cost, anti-poisoning catalyst has been expected. Here, it is skillfully used N-doped graphdiyne (NGDY) to prepare a zero-valent platinum atomic catalyst (Pt/NGDY), which shows excellent activity, high pH adaptability, and high CO tolerance for MOR. The Pt/NGDY electrocatalysts for MOR with specific activity 154.2 mA cm−2 (1449.3 mA mgPt−1), 29 mA cm−2 (296 mA mgPt−1) and 22 mA cm−2 (110 mA mgPt−1) in alkaline, acid, and neutral solutions. The specific activity of Pt/NGDY is 9 times larger than Pt/C in alkaline solution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the incorporation of electronegativity nitrogen atoms can increase the high coverage of Pt to achieve a unique atomic state, in which the shared contributions of different Pt sites reach the balance between the electroactivity and the stability to guarantee the higher performance of MOR and durability with superior anti-poisoning effect.",Advanced Science
Creating Unidirectional Fast Ion Diffusion Channels in G/NiS2-MoS2 Heterostructures for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Exploring novel electrode composites and their unique interface physics plays a significant role in tuning electrochemical properties for boosting the performance of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, mixed-dimensional G/NiS2-MoS2 heterostructures are synthesized in a low-cost meteorological vulcanization process. The stable graphene supporting layer and nanowire heterostructure guarantee an outstanding structural stability to tolerate certain volume changes during the charge/discharge process. The rational construction of NiS2-MoS2 heterostructures induces abundant interfaces and unique ion diffusion channels, which render fast electrochemical kinetics and superior reversible capacities for high-performance SIBs. Interestingly, theoretical studies reveal that the anisotropic diffusion barriers create unidirectional “high-speed” channels, which can lead to ordered and fast Na+ insertion/extraction in designed heterostructures. G/NiS2-MoS2 anode exhibits a high capacity of 509.6 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles and a coulombic efficiency >99% at 0.5 A g−1, which also displays excellent cycling performance with the capacity of 383.8 mA h g−1 after the 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Furthermore, full cells are constructed exhibiting a high capacity of 70 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 150 cycles and applied to light LEDs. This study provides a feasible strategy of constructing mixed-dimensional heterostructures for SIBs with excellent performance and a long service lifetime.",Small
Role of the Metal Atom in a Carbon-Based Single-Atom Electrocatalyst for Li-S Redox Reactions,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Carbon-based single metal atom catalysts (SACs) are being extensively investigated to improve the kinetics of the Li–S redox reaction, which is greatly important for batteries with cell-level energy densities >500 W h kg-1. However, there are contradictory reports regarding the electrocatalytic activities of the different metal atoms and the role of the metal atom in Li-S chemistry still remains unclear. This is due to the complex relationship between the catalytic behavior and the structure of carbon-based SACs. Here, the catalytic behavior and active-site geometry, oxidation state, and the electronic structure of different metal centers (Fe/Co/Ni) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene, and having similar physicochemical characteristics, are studied. Combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and electrochemical analysis, it is revealed that the coordination-geometry and oxidation state of the metal atoms are modified when interacting with sulfur species. This interaction is strongly dependent on the hybridization of metal 3d and S p-orbitals. A moderate hybridization with the Fermi level crossing the metal 3d band is more favorable for Li-S redox reactions. This study thus provides a fundamental understanding of how metal atoms in SACs impact Li-S redox behavior and offers new guidelines to develop highly active catalytic materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.",Small
Ordered Mesoporous Boron Carbon Nitrides with Tunable Mesopore Nanoarchitectonics for Energy Storage and CO2 Adsorption Properties,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Porous boron carbon nitride (BCN) is one of the exciting systems with unique electrochemical and adsorption properties. However, the synthesis of low-cost and porous BCN with tunable porosity is challenging, limiting its full potential in a variety of applications. Herein, the preparation of well-defined mesoporous boron carbon nitride (MBCN) with high specific surface area, tunable pores, and nitrogen contents is demonstrated through a simple integration of chemical polymerization of readily available sucrose and borane ammonia complex (BAC) through the nano-hard-templating approach. The bimodal pores are introduced in MBCN by controlling the self-organization of BAC and sucrose molecules within the nanochannels of the template. It is found that the optimized sample shows a high specific capacitance (296 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), large specific capacity for sodium-ion battery (349 mAg h−1 at 50 mAh g−1), and excellent CO2 adsorption capacity (27.14 mmol g−1 at 30 bar). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that different adsorption sites (B-C, B-N, C-N, and C-C) and the large specific surface area strongly support the high adsorption capacity. This finding offers an innovative breakthrough in the design and development of MBCN nanostructures for energy storage and carbon capture applications.",Advanced Science

A novel modified sulfur cathode to facilitate the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides in lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Physical confinement through particular nanostructures is inadequate to avoid the shuttle effect in the lithium–sulfur batteries. Electrocatalysts are based on chemisorption to fix polysulfides on the sulfur cathode and catalyze the conversion of polysulfides. Herein, a novel electrocatalyst consisting of iridium and rGO as support was prepared and employed as the additive to the sulfur cathode. Due to selective catalytic property and changes in activation energy, the formation of polysulfides is slightly inhibited and the transformation of polysulfides is accelerated. Finally, the accumulation of polysulfides and shuttle effect are alleviated. Due to the strong interaction between the polysulfide and catalyst, capacity retention and rate performance were greatly improved.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry
Comparative assessment of heterogeneous and homogeneous Suzuki-Miyaura catalytic reactions using bio-Profiles and bio-Factors,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transition metals are essential for most catalytic systems in fine organic synthesis. The usage of transition metals has traditionally raised concerns about their toxicity and potential environmental pollution problems. In this context, the issue of preference for supported catalysts, which can be easily removed from the reaction mixture, over metal complex catalysts is of significant relevance. In this work, we used bio-Profiles and bio-Factors of chemical reactions to assess the impact of catalyst type on the toxicity of a reaction system in the practically important Suzuki-Miyaura reaction. The supported catalysts had noticeably lower cytotoxicity than soluble metal complex catalysts. However, the combined effect of supported catalysts on the environment can depend on their preparation procedure and may have a noticeable “neglected” biological impact. Both types of catalysts made no significant contribution to the “overall toxicity” of the systems studied, while common and typically ignored byproducts demonstrated significantly higher “overall” biological influence. In the present study, we describe how to use bio-Profiles in order to visualize and analyze the biological properties of different types of catalytic reactions.",Journal of Organometallic Chemistry
A DFT investigation on the mechanical and structural properties of halogen- and metal-adsorbed silicene nanosheets,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Herein, the effects of halogen and metal atomic adsorption on the mechanical and structural characteristics of silicene are studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Cl, Br, Au, Ca, Ga, Li, and Na atoms are selected as the adsorption atoms. Moreover, the phonon dispersion and electron localization function are investigated to show the stability of considered nanostructures and to visualize the bonding properties, respectively. It is shown that the adsorption leads to decreasing the elastic and bulk moduli of some structures, while it increases them in some other structures. It is seen that except for Ca-adsorbed nanosheet, both the elastic and bulk moduli of all other structures decrease after adsorption. Furthermore, the isotropic behavior of all the studied nanosheets is indicated. The plastic behavior is also analyzed. It is revealed that the second critical strain of all nanosheets, except for SiBr and SiCl, decreases under uniaxial loading. However, under biaxial loading conditions, the second critical strain of Au-, Ca-, and Ga-adsorbed structures decreases, while in other structures (SiBr, SiCl, SiLi, and SiNa) the adsorption increases the yield strain.",Materials Chemistry and Physics

Configurational and structural design of separators toward shuttling-free and dendrite-free lithium-sulfur batteries: A review,"© 2022Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are attracting increasing interest due to their advantages in high energy density, low cost and eco-friendliness. However, the shuttle effect of polysulfides and the uncontrollable growth of lithium (Li) dendrites, derived from the intrinsic characteristics of sulfur (S) cathode and Li anode, significantly deteriorate the electrochemical performance and threaten the safety of LSBs. The separator plays a profound role in the mass transport across the interfaces against both S cathode and Li anode; thus, separator engineering is the most promising and effective method to simultaneously tackle shuttle effect and dendrite growth. Fruitful work has reported the design and fabrication of functional separators that enable safe, durable, shuttling-free and dendrite-free LSBs.

"2,2′-bipyridine palladium (II) complexes derived N-doped carbon encapsulated palladium nanoparticles for formic acid oxidation","© 2022Doping nitrogen (N) into the carbon support was widely applied to enhance the performance of Pd toward formic acid electro-oxidation (FAO). However, traditional nitrogen doping methods can only introduce a low content of nitrogen as well as a two-step complicated procedure to synthesize catalysts. In this study, a facile one-pot strategy is demonstrated to prepare N-doped carbon encapsulated palladium nanoparticles (Pd@NxC) via the pyrolysis of 2,2′-bipyridine palladium (II) complexes. A N-doped carbon layer with the thickness of about 4 nm is in-situ generated over Pd nanoparticles by only one pyrolysis procedure. Both XPS and in-situ XRD results suggest that metallic Pd is reduced from Pd2+ by the complexed N in bipyridine during the pyrolysis at high temperature. The physical characterizations prove that the in-situ formation of N-doped carbon shell can not only effectively prevent the agglomeration or dissolution of Pd nanoparticles, but also promote the charge donation from the carbon layer to Pd, and maintain the structure of Pd atom complexed to two pyridinic-N atoms (Pd-N). This in-situ synthesis strategy can be successfully applied to carbon supports with different geometry, such as reduced graphene oxide and Vulcan XC-72. Pd@N3C/rGO, which contains the highest amount of N (7.39 at.%) and Pd-N (33.15%), shows the highest specific activity (5.88 mA cm−2) and excellent durability toward FAO.",Electrochimica Acta
"Structural, optical and electronic characteristics of Cu and Mg-doped nano MnS sample prepared by molten salt solid state reaction","© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Nano Mn0.95M0.05S (M ≡ Cu, Mg) samples were produced using molten salt solid state reaction method. Rietveld analysis of X-ray diffraction data was applied to investigate the percentage of phases developed and their structural parameters in the obtained samples. Analysis evidenced the incorporation of Cu and Mg into the MnS lattice. Diffraction patterns of pristine and Mg-doped samples exhibited biphasic MnS structure of hexagonal γ-MnS (wurtzite) and cubic β-MnS (zincblende) phases, while the Cu-doped sample exhibited only cubic phase for MnS; both doped samples contained a minor Mn3O4 phase. The selected area electron diffraction confirmed the formed phases in the prepared samples. The characteristic vibrational bands in each sample were investigated using Fourier transform infrared technique. The direct optical band gap of MnS, Cu or Mg-doped MnS are (3.04, 3.17), (3.52, 3.88) and (3.5, 3.91) eV respectively. The effect of doping on full width at half maximum, intensity and emitted colors of the photoluminescence spectra was studied. The effect of doping on the absorbance, refractive index, extinction coefficient, static dielectric constant and electric properties of MnS (hexagonal wurtzite structure) was explored using the density functional calculation. The emitted colors from doped nano MnS especially with Cu could be effectively used in LEDs applications.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics
Remarkable Activity of 002 Facet of Ruthenium Nanoparticles Grown on Graphene Films on the Photocatalytic CO2 Methanation,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.In the context of diminishing atmospheric CO2 emissions, there is an urgent need to develop processes that can be carried out at a scale commensurate with appropriate CO2 volumes. One possible reaction is the transformation of CO2 to methane (Sabatier reaction). Due to its chemical stability, catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to methane is carried out at temperatures of 450 °C or higher and pressures above 5 bars, thus, requiring a significant energy input. One alternative possibility to conventional thermal catalysis is the use of solar light as the primary energy, performing the photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. In this broad context, the present study shows the photocatalytic activity of nanometric films of oriented Ru nanoparticles (NPs) strongly grafted on defective graphene. These graphene films (thinner than 20 nm) containing Ru NPs nanoplatelets (less than 2 nanomolRu/cm2) are among the most active photocatalysts ever prepared for CO2 hydrogenation and operate through photoinduced charge separation.",Advanced Sustainable Systems
Multimodal Capturing of Polysulfides by Phosphorus-Doped Carbon Composites for Flexible High-Energy-Density Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The widespread adoption of Li-ion batteries is currently limited by their unstable electrochemical performance and high flammability under mechanical deformation conditions and a relatively low energy density. Herein, high-energy-density lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are developed for applications in next-generation flexible electronics and electric vehicles with long cruising distances. Freestanding high-S-loading carbon nanotubes cathodes are assembled with a phosphorus (P)-doped carbon interlayer coated on commercial separators. Strategies for the active materials and structural design of both the electrodes and separators are highly efficient for immobilizing the lithium polysulfides via multimodal capturing effects; they significantly improve the electrochemical performance in terms of the redox kinetics and cycling stability. The foldable Li–S cells show stable specific capacities of 850 mAh g−1 over 100 cycles, achieving high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of 387 Wh kgcell−1 and 395 Wh Lcell−1, respectively. The Li–S cells show highly durable mechanical flexibilities under severe deformation conditions without short circuit or failure. Finally, the Li–S battery is explored as a light-weight and flexible energy storage device aboard airplane drones to ensure at least fivefold longer flight times than traditional Li-ion batteries.

"One-step facile fabrication of N, S co-doped carbon modified NiS/MoS2 heterostructure microspheres with improved sodium storage performance","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal sulfides are considered potential anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to their unique structure and high theoretical capacities. Nevertheless, the low intrinsic electrical conductivity and sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics lead to inferior electrochemical performance, which greatly limits their practical application. In this work, we successfully constructed N, S co-doped carbon modified NiS/MoS2 heterostructures (denoted as NiS/MoS2) via a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The as-prepared sample was corroborated as an advanced anode for SIBs that simultaneously achieved high reversible capacity (670.2 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), excellent rate capability (249 mA h g−1 at 40 A g−1), and long-term cycling stability (573.8 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1). Furthermore, the superior cycle and rate performance are also reflected in the sodium-ion full cell, which demonstrates the potential value of the NiS/MoS2 anode in practical applications. The bimetallic sulfide heterostructure distinctly lowers the Na + diffusion energy barrier and elevates the reaction kinetics by a built-in electric field effect. In addition, the doping of N, S elements can form a strong bond with carbon to accommodate the volume change and boost the electron transfer. This work provides a valuable reference to develop advanced anode materials for SIBs for practical applications.",Journal of Power Sources
Macroscale Conjugated Microporous Polymers: Controlling Versatile Functionalities Over Several Dimensions,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Since discovered in 2007, conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) have been developed for numerous applications including gas adsorption, sensing, organic and photoredox catalysis, energy storage, etc. While featuring abundant micropores, the structural rigidity derived from CMPs’ stable π-conjugated skeleton leads to insolubility and thus poor processability, which severely limits their applicability, e.g., in CMP-based devices. Hence, the development of CMPs whose structure can not only be controlled on the micro- but also on the macroscale have attracted tremendous interest. In conventional synthesis procedures, CMPs are obtained as powders, but in recent years various bottom-up synthesis strategies have been developed, which yield CMPs as thin films on substrates or as hybrid materials, allowing to span length scales from individual conjugated monomers to micro-/macrostructures. This review surveys recent advances on the construction of CMPs into macroscale structures, including membranes, films, aerogels, sponges, and other architectures. The focus is to describe the underlying fabrication techniques and the implications which follow from the macroscale morphologies, involving new chemistry and physics in such materials for applications like molecular separation/filtration/adsorption, energy storage and conversion, photothermal transformation, sensing, or catalysis.",Advanced Materials

Furthermore, 4–8 AsNT is used as a base substrate to adsorb SF6 gas molecules and their decomposed constituents, namely SO2F2, and SOF2. The adsorption of SF6, SO2F2, and SOF2 shows physisorption nature on 4–8 AsNT, and the adsorption energy is recorded in the scope of −0.187 eV to −0.478 eV. The electron acceptor nature of 4–8 AsNT is exposed based on charge transfer and electron density difference results. The changes in the energy band are revealed from the band structure and PDOS (projected density of states) map due to SF6, SO2F2, and SOF2 molecular adsorption on 4–8 AsNT. Thus, the results support that 4–8 AsNT is a proper base material to detect SF6, SO2F2, and SOF2 leakage from the gas-insulated switchgear.",Computational and Theoretical Chemistry
A Universal Polyiodide Regulation Using Quaternization Engineering toward High Value-Added and Ultra-Stable Zinc-Iodine Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.The development of aqueous rechargeable zinc-iodine (Zn-I2) batteries is still plagued by the polyiodide shuttle issue, which frequently causes batteries to have inadequate cycle lifetimes. In this study, quaternization engineering based on the concept of “electric double layer” is developed on a commercial acrylic fiber skeleton ($1.55–1.7 kg−1) to precisely constrain the polyiodide and enhance the cycling durability of Zn-I2 batteries. Consequently, a high-rate (1 C–146.1 mAh g−1, 10 C–133.8 mAh g−1) as well as, ultra-stable (2000 cycles at 20 C with 97.24% capacity retention) polymer-based Zn-I2 battery is reported. These traits are derived from the strong electrostatic interaction generated by quaternization engineering, which significantly eliminates the polyiodide shuttle issue and simultaneously realizes peculiar solution-based iodine chemistry (I−/I3−) in Zn-I2 batteries. The quaternization strategy also presents high practicability, reliability, and extensibility in various complicated environments. In particular, cutting-edge Zn-I2 batteries based on the concept of derivative material (commercially available quaternized resin) demonstrate ≈100% capacity retention over 17 000 cycles at 20 C. This work provides a general and fresh insight into the design and development of large-scale, low-cost, and high-performance zinc-iodine batteries, as well as, other novel iodine storage systems.",Advanced Science

As a result, the lithium anode can stably cycle up to 3000 cycles with the high capacity of 3.5 mAh cm−2. Moreover, the composite separator exhibits wide compatibility in LMBs (Li–S and Li-ion battery) and delivers stable cycling performance and high Coulombic efficiency both in coin and lab-level soft-pack cells. Thus, this cost-effective modification strategy exhibits great application potential in high-energy LMBs.",Advanced Science
Constructing 3D Porous Current Collectors for Stable and Dendrite-Free Lithium Metal Anodes,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered promising candidates for the next-generation rechargeable batteries due to the ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g−1) and the lowest negative electrochemical potential (−3.040 V versus the standard hydrogen anode) of lithium metal. However, the practical application of LMBs has been hindered by various serious challenges, especially the low cycling stability of lithium anodes due to the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites, unstable solid–electrolyte interphase, and excessive volume change of lithium metal. 3D lithium metal anodes with reduced local current density and alleviated volume expansion can be used to improve the safety performance of LMBs. The design of various 3D structures is therefore critical to achieve high-performance lithium metal anodes. This review summarizes recent advances of several important 3D porous structures such as foam structures, parallel arrays, interweaved structures, coiled structures, Janus structures, gradient structures, and alloy frameworks for stable and dendrite-free lithium metal anodes. The constructing strategies and modification methods of 3D lithium metal anodes are discussed in detail.

Ultrathin nanosheets of FeOOH with oxygen vacancies as efficient polysulfide electrocatalyst for advanced lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022Developing high effectively affinitive to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion, permanent electrochemical stability, and cost-effective electrocatalyst for sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) in a high‐sulfur‐loading and lean-electrolyte condition is highly desired for the application of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an amorphous FeOOH (A-FeOOH) with nanosheet architecture is obtained by a mild oxidation transformation process at room temperature, which is constructed as a practical catalyst to facilitate the conversion of LiPSs. A systematic structure analysises and calculation simulations reveal that the enhanced surface electron transfer dynamics of the as-formed A-FeOOH is modulated by a loss of oxygen coordination, and retention ligand oxygens are also found to be activated as co-catalysts to boost SRR process. Unsaturated Fe-O bondings tuning of catalysts via shifting of d band centers, leading to an elevated interaction between Fe 3d orbitals and S 2p orbitals, which much more effectively accelerate the breaking of S-S bonds in LiPSs. Meanwhile, enhanced electrical conductivity originated from oxygen vacancies accelerates electron repopulation, thereby promoting the smooth conversion reaction of sulfur. Additionally, A-FeOOH acts as non-carbon-based catalysts, which alleviates short circuits while reducing non-catalytic domains. The amorphous nanosheets are also uniformly and spontaneously coating on the surface of cathodes, inhibiting the shuttle effect and buffering volumetric expansion. A-FeOOH based Li-S cathode (A-FeOOH@SCM) exhibits a reversible capacity of 723 mAh.g−1 over 250 cycles at 1C and delivers a high energy density of 363 wh.kg−1 at 0.2C on multilayer-pouch cell level under lean electrolyte of 3.2 g.g−1Sulfur and high loading of 9.36 mg.cm−2.",Energy Storage Materials

This study demonstrates the robust and stable nature of a closo-borate based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE), which enables outstanding electrochemical stability and capacity retention upon extensive cycling. The GPE developed herein has an ionic conductivity of 7.3 × 10−4 S cm−2 at room temperature and stability over a wide temperature range from −35 to 80 °C with a high lithium transference number ((Formula presented.) = 0.51). Multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared are used to understand the solvation environment and interaction between the GPE components.

Whereas the slow redox kinetics and the shuttle effect of polysulfides (PSs) still severely restrict the performance of Li−S batteries. Here, a rational designed ferromagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (FM-Fe3O4 NPs) modified separator is engineered for Li−S batteries. Moreover, the particle size of FM-Fe3O4 NPs was tuned to enhance the energy storage performance. Consequently, the cells with FM-Fe3O4 NPs modified separator achieved a high-rate and long cycling performance, the specific capacity could reach 672.8 mAh g−1 and a low fading rate (0.028 % per cycle over 700 cycles) at a high rate of 5 C. Experimental results reveals that FM-Fe3O4 NPs could mitigate shuttle effect, enable efficient redox reactions, and protect the Li anode from severe corrosion. The performance-enhanced mechanism is further discovered by DFT calculations, the results show that FM-Fe3O4 NPs act as mediators of redox reaction to block PSs shuttle and dynamically facilitate conversion via changing the molecular structure of PSs and reducing reaction barrier. This work provides a new pathway to improving Li−S batteries based on ferromagnetic materials, which may be generalized to other advanced batteries.",Batteries and Supercaps

Here, we report a feasible strategy to effectively suppress polysulfide and selectively control ions transport applying a new-type ultralight aerofilm membrane for practical Li-S batteries. Catalytic hybrid aerofilm interlayer (HAI) consisting of sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene and manganese dioxide nanowires suffices physical shield and sieve polysulfides through sulphophilicity polymer within the gaps of manganese dioxide layers, while also imparting chemical anchoring and catalysis of Mn-O. Such co-operative synergetic effects of the hybrid aerofilm interlayer for the Li-S cells enable the realization of a high discharge capacity of 1189 mAh g−1 at the end of the 500th cycle with a capacity retention of over 92.3 %, which is a 671 % improvement over sulfur battery with NO interlayer. Moreover, the aerofilm interlayer provides Li-dendritic growth inhibition and self-discharge prevention to retain the cycle life and safety of the device.

In-situ constructed three-dimensional MoS2–MoN heterostructure as the cathode of lithium–sulfur battery,"© 2022, Youke Publishing Co.,Ltd.Lithium–sulfur batteries are recognized as one of the most promising next-generation high-performance energy storage systems. However, obstacles like the irreversible capacity loss hinder its broad application. Herein, we fabricated an interconnected three-dimensional MoS2–MoN heterostructure (3D-MoS2–MoN) via a facile salt-template method, overcoming the intrinsic shortcomings such as poor conductivity and compact morphology of traditionally-synthesized transition metal sulfides (TMSs). Furthermore, excellent electrocatalysis ability and hierarchical pore structure effectively accelerate the sluggish lithium polysulfides conversions during cycling. As a result, 3D-MoS2–MoN showed a high initial specific capacity of 1466 mAh·g−1 and excellent high-rate capability up to 4 °C. A stable cycling performance with a sulfur loading of 2 mg·cm−2 was realized with a low decay rate of 0.069% per cycle.

Uncovering electrocatalytic conversion mechanisms from Li2S2 to Li2S: Generalization of computational hydrogen electrode,"© 2022Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have been strongly considered as promising next-generation batteries due to their significant advantages on theoretical energy density. However, the practical application of Li–S batteries are seriously impeded by the sluggish conversion reaction from Li2S2 to Li2S. The solution of this problem relies on comprehensive understanding of Li2S2 conversion mechanisms. Herein, a theoretical model is established by generalizing the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) approach. More specifically, Li2S2 conversion is redefined in elementary steps that includes the participation of each electron. Associative and dissociative reaction mechanisms with electrocatalysts are proposed and inspected by the free energy criterion. Single atom catalysts containing Fe, Co, Ni, and V are discussed separately. The effects of applied electrode potential are accurately described by the generalized CHE approach. It is predicted that associative reaction mechanism can provide the highest electrode potential with the existence of Fe single atom catalysts. Analysis on electronic structures further confirms the electrocatalysis activity originates from the chemical bonds between S and transition metal atoms. This work unveils the Li2S2 conversion mechanisms in elementary steps. More importantly, the generalized CHE approach opens a new frontier of exploration on redox reactions in Li–S battery and hopefully other energy storage systems.",Energy Storage Materials
Dendrite-Free Lithium Deposition and Stripping Regulated by Aligned Microchannels for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Li metal is the ultimate choice for the anode in next-generation high energy density rechargeable batteries. However, undesired dendrite growth, dead Li formation, and a large volume change of the lithium metal anode lead to severe safety hazards such as short-circuiting, fire, or even explosion. Graphene oxide (GO) in large areas has been prepared as the Li metal host via a continuous centrifugal casting method. Aligned microchannels are then fabricated in it by a simple punching method using 3D printed templates. The GO matrix effectively regulates the lithium plating/stripping behavior while the aligned channels uniformly distributes the Li-ion flux and provides short Li-ion diffusion paths. The Li/ holey GO composite is flexible with a controllable thickness from 50 to 150 µm, which corresponds to capacities from 9.881 to 27.601 mAh cm−2. As a result, the anode has a low overpotential of 30 mV after 100 h, a high capacity of ≈3538 mAh g−1 (91.4% of the theoretical capacity), and a superior rate ability of up to 50 C with a LiFePO4 cathode. The holey GO/Li electrode is also paired with other cathodes and used in pouch cells, indicating its suitability for various high-energy battery systems.",Advanced Functional Materials
Electrolyte Optimization and Interphase Regulation for Significantly Enhanced Storage Capability in Ca-Metal Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Electrolyte solvent, salt, and additive directly determine many battery indicators such as voltage limit, safe reliability, and temperature limit. In Ca-metal batteries, suitable electrolyte and interphase are necessary to achieve reversible calcium plating/stripping, which is challenging for F-based salts at room temperature. Ion transport and charge transfer in calcium batteries with Ca(BF4)2-NaPF6 electrolyte are regulated for the first time by altering solvent and salt categories and ratios, achieving adjustable interphase species and microstructure, calcium deposition/dissolution overpotentials, and cycling stability. The optimized electrolyte of 0.1 m Ca(BF4)2-0.9 m NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/ethyl methyl carbonate (7:1:6:6, v/v) contributes to the most stable Ca plating/stripping cycling and the weakest overpotential, as well as Na/Ca-based hybrid solid electrolyte interphases including proper amount of organic matter. Ca-metal batteries with the optimized electrolyte achieve an ultrahigh reversible capacity of ≈290 mAh g−1 (at 200 mA g−1 and 1.2–4.5 V), almost four times more than that of counterpart ones (≈65 mAh g−1), equivalent to energy/power performance of ≈616 Wh kg−1 at 429 W kg−1 among the best ones for multivalent ion rechargeable metal batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials

Nevertheless, performance ceiling exists, restrict severely by the significant LiPSs diffusion barrier, which inevitably decrease the conversion efficiency of LiPSs. Amorphization can not only promote the diffusion of LiPSs on catalyst surface but also induce the modulation of surface electronic states and strengthen the adsorption toward LiPSs, in comparison with crystalline counterpart. Herein, crystalline Mo2C−amorphous MoO3 heterostructure grown on nitrogen doped carbon nanosheets is meticulously designed as an efficient sulfur immobilizer and promoter through a facile oxygen plasma treatment strategy. With the integrated advantage of improved adsorption and facilitated diffusion of LiPSs by amorphous MoO3, superior LiPSs redox kinetics by the catalytic effect of conductive Mo2C, and long-range electron transfer network arising from nitrogen doped carbon nanosheets, the assembled battery based on the as-developed modified separator endows excellent electrochemical performance and satisfactory cycling stability.

Herein, PVP is innovatively incorporated with VS4 and induced synergistic engineering, including the enlarged interchain spacing, V3+ self-doping, rich sulfur vacancies and the selectively exposing active surface of (020) facets, which results in the fast kinetics of co-intercalation of Mg2+ and MgCl+, electrolyte infiltration, more active sites exposure, and the strain/stress relaxation during insertion/extraction process for the high stability of structure. Therefore, this novel design of PVP-VS4 exhibits long-term cycling stability (80% capacity retention at 5000 mA g−1 after 1500 cycles) and exceptional high-rate capability (140 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 with 45 mAh g−1 at 5000 mA g−1).

Herein, the hollow fiber stitched by enoki-mushroom-like carbon nanotube with enriched Ni-N4 single-atomic edge-sites (Ni/N-ESC) is constructed. The nickel clusters are introduced to catalyze in-situ growth of carbon nanotubes and preferentially anchor single-atomic Ni-N sites. These hairy units stitch together similar to enoki-mushroom and constitute the highly porous matrix for hollow fibers. After self-sacrifice of nickel clusters, hollow fibers assembled by carbon nanotubes with edge-enriched single-atomic Ni-N4 sites are constructed. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the edge-rich single-atomic sites manifest superior activities on both oxygen and CO2 catalysis. Meanwhile, the highly porous and conductive framework favors the fast kinetics and gives abundant active sites. Taking above advantages, the Ni/N-ESC hollow fiber manifests the outstanding activities towards both oxygen catalysis and CO2 conversions. Moreover, the flexible Zn-air battery assembled with Ni/N-ESC hollow fiber delivers the good flexibility, high power/energy density and stable property during long-term cycling at both ambient (25 °C) and freezing (-20 °C) temperatures.

Heterostructure ZnSe-CoSe2 embedded with yolk-shell conductive dodecahedral as Two-in-one hosts for cathode and anode protection of Lithium–Sulfur full batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Simultaneously realizing the cathode and anode protection is critical for developing practical lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Currently, many efforts have been devoted to solving problems related to either shuttle effect on sulfur cathode or dendrite growth on lithium anode. However, dual side protection is rarely reported. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized yolk-shell nitrogen doped carbon frameworks embedded with heterostructures ZnSe-CoSe2 (ZnSe-CoSe2@NC), working as “two-in-one” hosts for both the sulfur cathode and lithium anode protection. As an anode host, the in situ formed Li2Se phase contributes to the Li+ transfer. Co and Zn guides a homogenous growth of Li within the 3D framework, thus effectively suppressing Li dendrite growth. Meanwhile, the heterostructure ZnSe-CoSe2 endows the cathode host with superior electronic conductivity, strong polysulfide chemisorption and efficient catalytic activity for polysulfide redox when compared with single metal selenides. Combined with these advantages, this Li-S full cell exhibits ultralong cycle life over 1000 cycles at 2 C. Even with a high sulfur loading (6.08 mg cm−2) and lean electrolyte (4.1 µL mg−1), the full cell achieves a high areal capacity of 4.16 mA h cm−2 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. This work not only provides a new approach for the structure design of Li-S full battery, but also improves the utilization of active electrode materials.",Energy Storage Materials
Implanting Single Zn Atoms Coupled with Metallic Co Nanoparticles into Porous Carbon Nanosheets Grafted with Carbon Nanotubes for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is severely hindered by the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, an integrated composite catalyst consisting of Co nanoparticles and single-atom (SA) Zn co-implanted in nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets grafted with carbon nanotubes (Co/SA-Zn@N-C/CNTs) is rationally developed toward this challenge. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the synergistically dual active sites of Co and atomic Zn-N4 moieties with an optimal charge redistribution not only strongly confine the LiPSs but also effectively catalyze its conversion reactions by lowering the energy barrier from Li2S2 to Li2S while the N-doped porous carbon-grafted CNTs enables a large surface area for more active site exposure and provides a fast electron/ion pathway. Benefiting from synergies, Li-S batteries equipped with the Co/SA-Zn@N-C/CNTs-based sulfur cathode exhibit a high reversible capacity of 1302 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and a low capacity fading rate of 0.033% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C. Moreover, a high areal capacity of 4.5 mAh cm−2 at 0.2 C with the sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm−2 can be achieved.

Catalytic polysulfide conversion in lithium-sulfur batteries by platinum nanoparticles supported on carbonized microspheres,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) battery has attracted extensive attentions in the field of energy storage due to its high theoretical specific capacity and low cost. However, the shuttle effect restricts its energy density and cycle performance, that hinders the industrialization process of Li-S battery. The introduction of catalysis in conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is an effective strategy to suppress shuttle effect. Metal nanoparticles (NPs) are attractive catalysts due to excellent electrical conductivity and rapid electron transfer efficiency, therefore, metal NPs have great potential to be introduced in Li-S battery for studying and revealing elementary conversion reactions of LiPSs. Herein, based on the strategy of accelerating conversion of LiPSs integrated with physical confinement, we designed and synthesized Pt NPs supported on carbonized microspheres (Pt/CS composites). The catalytic conversion of LiPSs from charge transfer between Pt NPs and carbon matrix, combined with the strong physical confinement by surface pores of CS, result in upgraded electrochemical properties. It is demonstrated that the resulting Pt/CS cathode exhibits improved rate performance with specific capacity of 991.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, and maintains a fine cycling stability.

Facile synthesis of ternary transition metal-organic framework and its stable lithium storage properties,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered as promising electrode materials due to their high controllability and regular pore structure. Nevertheless, limited by the low ionic conductivity of organic frameworks and the huge volume change caused by the conversion reaction of metal ions with Li+, their long-term stability and rate performance are not satisfactory. In this paper, a regular micron rod-shaped nickel, iron and manganese benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylate trimetallic organic framework (NiFeMn-pma) was synthesized by a one-pot method. It belongs to monoclinic symmetry and P21/n space group, in which metal ions are coordinated with different oxygen atoms on the carboxyl group of pyromellitic acid to form a three-dimensional structure. Remarkably, thanks to the change of the lithium storage form from a conversion reaction to an intercalation reaction based on a carboxyl group and a benzene ring, NiFeMn-pma exhibits a high capacity of 802.1 mAh g-1 and excellent cycle stability (624 mAh g-1 at 100 ​mA ​g-1 over 100 cycles) as an anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Compared with single metal MOF (Ni-pma) and bimetal MOF (NiFe-pma), tri-metal MOF (NiFeMn-pma) exhibits enhanced rate performance, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of multi-metal mixing sites. Meanwhile, the surface of NiFeMn-pma electrode is porous after 100 cycles, which can significantly improve the penetration of electrolyte and promote the migration of lithium ions. The research paved the way for the potential application of MOF materials in lithium-ion batteries.",Journal of Solid State Chemistry

Single-atom tailoring of Li2S to Form Li2S2 for building better lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The Li2S-based cathodes to couple with Li-free anodes are regarded as a commercially available approach to overcome the safety risk of lithium metal anodes. However, the passivated Li2S instinct leads to a high activation potential in the initial charging process, and the notorious shuttle effect of polysulfide is inevitable upon cell cycling. Here we create a single atom tailoring strategy by comproportionation reactions (Li2S + 1/8S8 = Li2S2) to form the Li2S2 materials without any complex manufacturing process or additives, where the Li2S2 cell enables a lower potential barrier and allows for the 3.0 V activation voltage without any other material modification. Meanwhile, the polar conducting material TaB2 is introduced to restrain the migration of polysulfides, and provide fast redox reaction kinetics. With those ingenious tailoring of cell designs, the Li2S2-TaB2 cell (Li2S2: 88 wt%) exhibits high areal capacity (4.6 mAh/cm2 at 6.0 mg/cm2 Li2S2 loading), excellent cycling stability (500 cycles at 1.6 mA/cm2).",Energy Storage Materials

As the proof of concept, prototype BaTiO3 is used as the ferroelectric additive. Interestingly, the rationally-fabricated composite structure ensures homogeneous distribution of ferroelectric particles within the carbon framework through the liquid medium and effectively avoids aggregation of ferroelectrics that was always seen in traditional compositing methods. Profiting from the electrochemically active merits including uniform dispersion of ferroelectrics, activated carbonaceous porous structure, enhanced crystallinity of BaTiO3, and high-strength component interactions that were introduced by the molten-salt strategy, the as-prepared cathode presented excellent rate capabilities and outstanding cycling stability. This work marks a step ahead towards the fabrication of high-performance ferroelectric based composites for advanced energy conversion and storage use.",Chemical Engineering Journal

However, the applications of LDHs are hindered by their poor activity, sluggish mass transfer, and aggregation. LDHs functionalized by carbonaceous materials (CMs) (LDH-CM) are expected to overcome the above disadvantages and even generate more excellent performance. This review first analyzes the research evolvement of LDH-CM composites during the past 25 years. Next, the advantages of LDH-CM composites are highlighted, such as morphology optimization, high electrical conductivity, more stable, good heat, and mass transfer performance. Following the synthetic strategies, including chemical assembly of LDHs and CMs, direct growth of LDH on CMs (two-step nucleation and growth and surface-confined growth) and direct CM formation on LDHs are fully discussed. Then, the recent progress achieved in LDH-CM composites for the application of energy storage and environmental protection is summarized in detail. In particular, the review illustrates the reasons why these constructing strategies can improve the performance of LDH-CM composites. Finally, challenges and future research prospects of LDH-CM composites are highlighted. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Environmental Science and Pollution Research

The as-prepared thin-layered Cd1−xPS3Li2x electrode delivers high capacities of 1056 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and 678 mAh g−1 at 8 A g−1, when used as anode in lithium-ion batteries. The variation of electronic structure and spatial layered structure in Cd1−xPS3Li2x induced by the synergistic effect of lithium-ion intercalation and Cd vacancies promote the dynamics of mixed electron/ion transport and offer more ion diffusion pathways, resulting in its excellent electrochemical performance. The strategy of mixed electron/ion conduction tuning for Cd1−xPS3Li2x can be extended to other MPTCs compounds to further develop their potential in the field of energy storage.",Advanced Functional Materials
Exploring the Janus structure to improve kinetics in sulfur conversion of Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high theoretical capacity have been attracting attention as next-generation energy storage systems. The random deposition of electrically insulating solid lithium sulfide (Li2S) from lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) limits the complete conversion of sulfur. The introduction of sulfiphlic metal compounds to facilitate the conversion is not accompanied by morphological control over Li2S deposition. To tackle this issue, we demonstrate a Janus-structured particle of oxide/carbon that regulates the Li2S growth. The Janus particles are prepared by directional thermal deposition of MoO3 onto CNT-agglomerated spherical particles. Under potentiostatic discharge, we observe that Li2S is deposited predominantly on MoO3-coated regions on CNT particles, accompanied by high discharge capacity. As the deposition of Li2S is microscopically controlled, the diffusion path of ions/charges in the electrode is preserved. Moreover, it is confirmed that the adsorption and catalytic properties of MoO3 are greatly promoted by its lithiation during the charge/discharge process. Janus particle cathode cells achieve excellent performance, especially under kinetically limited conditions, such as ultra-high C-rates or high cathode sulfur densities.",Nano Energy
Manipulation of New Married Edge-Adjacent Fe2N5 Catalysts and Identification of Active Species for Oxygen Reduction in Wide pH Range,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Transition metal-nitrogen-carbon-based catalysts (M-N-C) serve as promising alternatives for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, their synthesis generally involves complex pyrolysis reactions, resulting in their high structure heterogeneity and consequently making it difficult to distinguish the catalytic active sites. Herein, atomically dispersed Fe2 on the hollow carbon spheres are synthesized as the model for insight into the active sites at the atomic level. By virtue of the systematic SCN− poisoning experiments and theoretical calculations, the authors find that both edge-adjacent Fe2N5 and graphitic N sites exhibit the pH-dependent poisoning kinetics, beyond a simple and traditional “SCN− poisoning M-Nx sites” notion, helping us to discriminate the edge-adjacent Fe2N5 structure and graphitic N species as the bi-active ORR sites in a wide pH range. Moreover, this is the first work to synthesize the new married edge-adjacent Fe2N5 structure in an experimental aspect. The original work offers an important insight to pinpoint the active species in different pH media, which can broaden the fundamental understanding to design M-N-C and metal-free-carbon-based catalysts for ORR.",Advanced Functional Materials
Li–Se batteries: Insights to the confined structure of selenium in hierarchical porous carbon and discharge mechanism in the carbonate electrolyte,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdConfining selenium in porous carbon hosts is an effective strategy to improve the performance of Li–Se batteries. The structure of confined Se and the corresponding lithiation mechanism remain to be clarified yet. In this work, Se@CISC-58 composite material was prepared based on hierarchical porous carbon CISC-58 with same content of mesopores and micropores, and then used for cathode material of Li–Se batteries. The selenium loaded in Se@CISC-58 takes Sex chain structure rather than the cyclic Se8, as evidenced by both 77Se MAS NMR and EPR experiments. In particular, the free radical signals in EPR changes adaptively with the discharge-charge cycling. Ex-stiu EPR and in-stiu 7Li NMR techniques further confirmed the stepwise reaction mechanism of Sex chains in the carbonate-based electrolytes. To better understand the discharge process of selenium, NMR in combination with DFT calculations are utilized to assign the polyselenides engaged in discharge process. We have found that polyselenides represented by Li2Se2 were generated during the discharge of selenium in the carbonate-based electrolytes.",Carbon
Mixed-Valence iron phosphate as an effective catalytic host for the High-Rate Lithium-Sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur battery, one of the most attractive candidates for next-generation energy storage systems, commonly suffers from sluggish polysulfide conversion and detrimental shuttle mechanism. To solve these issues, finding novel catalytic hosts and strategies to facilitate polysulfide redox reaction is gaining much importance nowadays. Herein, we report oxidation-state-controlled amorphous FePO4 as an effective catalytic host for polysulfide conversion for the first time. For this study, we fabricated the FePO4-embedded 3D graphene composite by facile hydrothermal reaction and tailored the ratio of Fe2+/Fe3+ in the amorphous FePO4 by a thermal treatment in the reducing H2 atmosphere. A series of electrochemical tests showed that the mixed-valence FePO4 demonstrates enhanced catalytic ability than Fe3+-dominant FePO4. Surface and bandgap analyses indicate that such enhanced kinetics of mixed-valence FePO4 is attributed to the combined effects of promoted electron conduction and chemical interaction. By introducing mixed-valence FePO4 into the cathode, the battery showed robust cyclability delivering an excellent capacity of 784 mAh∙g−1 at 1C after 300 cycles (retained capacity of ∼ 78%) and superior rate performance exhibiting over 872 mAh∙g−1 at a high rate of 2C.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Atomic Structure Modification of Fe‒N‒C Catalysts via Morphology Engineering of Graphene for Enhanced Conversion Kinetics of Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom M‒N‒C catalysts have attracted tremendous attention for their application to electrocatalysis. Nitrogen-coordinated mononuclear metal moieties (MNx moities) are bio-inspired active sites that are analogous to various metal-porphyrin cofactors. Given that the functions of metal-porphyrin cofactors are highly dependent on the local coordination environments around the mononuclear active site, engineering MNx active sites in heterogeneous M‒N‒C catalysts would provide an additional degree of freedom for boosting their electrocatalytic activity. This work presents a local coordination structure modification of FeN4 moieties via morphological engineering of graphene support. Introducing highly wrinkled structure in graphene matrix induces nonplanar distortion of FeN4 moieties, resulting in the modification of electronic structure of mononuclear Fe. Electrochemical analysis combined with first-principles calculations reveal that enhanced electrocatalytic lithium polysulfide conversion, especially the Li2S redox step, is attributed to the local structure modified FeN4 active sites, while increased specific surface area also contributes to improved performance at low C-rates. Owing to the synergistic combination of atomic-level modified FeN4 active sites and morphological advantage of graphene support, Fe‒N‒C catalysts with wrinkled graphene morphology show superior lithium–sulfur battery performance at both low and high C-rates (particularly 915.9 mAh g−1 at 5 C) with promising cycling stability.",Advanced Functional Materials
Engineering single-atom Fe-Pyridine N4 sites to boost peroxymonosulfate activation for antibiotic degradation in a wide pH range,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSingle-atom Fe catalysts have shown great potential for Fenton-like technology in organic pollutant decomposition. However, the underlying reaction pathway and the identification of Fe active sites capable of activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) across a wide pH range remain unknown. We presented a novel strategy for deciphering the production of singlet oxygen (1O2) by regulating the Fe active sites in this study. Fe single atoms loaded on nitrogen-doped porous carbon (FeSA-CN) catalysts were synthesized using a cage encapsulation method and compared to Fe-nanoparticle-loaded catalysts. It was discovered that FeSA-CN catalysts served as efficient PMS activators for pollutant decomposition over a wide pH range. Several analytical measurements and density functional theory calculations revealed that the pyridinic N-ligated Fe single atom (Fe-pyridine N4) was involved in the production of 1O2 by the binding of two PMS ions, resulting in an excellent catalytic performance for PMS adsorption/activation. This work has the potential to not only improve the understanding of nonradical reaction pathway but to also provide a generalizable method for producing highly stable PMS activators with high activity for practical wastewater treatment.",Chemosphere
Constructing direct Z-scheme Mn0.5Cd0.5S/CdWO4 nanocomposite modified by hollow CoSx polyhedrons for highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Constructing heterojunction photocatalytic systems with highly spatial charge separation, strong photoredox ability and rapid surface reaction still remains an enormous challenge. Herein, hollow CoSx polyhedrons decorated hierarchically direct Z-scheme Mn0.5Cd0.5S/CdWO4 heterojunction photocatalyst is designed and constructed by a simple sonochemical approach and subsequent in situ deposition route. Such a constructed Mn0.5Cd0.5S/CdWO4/CoSx ternary composite exhibits a significantly boosted photoactivity toward H2 generation compared to bare Mn0.5Cd0.5S, binary Mn0.5Cd0.5S/CdWO4, Mn0.5Cd0.5S/CoSx and Mn0.5Cd0.5S/Pt samples with optimized composition ratio. Apart from the efficient charge transfer channels and preserved strong photoredox ability within the direct Z-scheme Mn0.5Cd0.5S/CdWO4 heterojunction, the hollow structure of CoSx polyhedrons could endow abundant surface-active sites, strengthen the light-harvesting capacity through the internal multilight scattering/reflection and decrease the overpotential for H2 evolution, which further contributes to the boosted photoactivity toward hydrogen production. This study demonstrates an alternate methodology for constructing high-performance multi-hierarchical Z-scheme/cocatalyst heterojunction photocatalysts for solar energy conversion.",Ceramics International
Fluorobenzene diluted low-density electrolyte for high-energy density and high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesThe mass fraction of electrolytes is the crucial factor affecting the energy density of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Due to the high porosity within the C/S cathode, high concentration of polysulfides, and side reaction in lithiun metal anode under lean electrolyte, it is extremely challenging to improve performance while reducing the electrolyte volume. Here, we report a novel electrolyte with relatively low density (1.16 g cm−3), low viscosity (1.84 mPa s), and high ionic conductivity, which significantly promotes energy density and cyclability of Li-S batteries under practical conditions. Moreover, such electrolyte enables a hybrid cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer with plentiful LiF, which leads to fast kinetics of ions transport and stable cyclability even under low temperatures. Compared to Li-S batteries in electrolyte employing 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) diluent, the ultra-thick cathode (20 mg cm−2) shows a high capacity of 9.48 mAh cm−2 and excellent capacity retention of 80.3% over 191 cycles at a low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio (E/S = 2) and negative-to-positive capacity ratio (N/P = 2.5), realizing a 19.2% improvement in energy density in coin cells (from 370 to 441 Wh kg−1) and a high energy density up to 467 Wh kg−1 in pouch cells. This study not only provides guidance for the electrolyte design but also paves the way for the development of high performance Li-S batteries under practical conditions.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Tunable electronic properties of porous graphitic carbon nitride (C6N7) monolayer by atomic doping and embedding: A first-principle study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Motivated by the successful synthesis of the porous graphitic carbon nitride (C6N7) monolayer very recently, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of C6N7 with doped and embedded with various atoms by means of spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. C6N7 monolayers doped with B, N, C, and O atoms have been revealed as stable and predicted to be feasible for experimental fabrication as free-standing monolayers based on the energy and thermal stability. Our computations demonstrate that while the C6N7 is a semiconductor, the doped C6N7 monolayers can be metal, dilute-magnetic semiconductor or half-metal. Further, a non magnetic moment is discovered in three of the doped C6N7 models and their electronic properties are disclosed to depend strongly on the spin configurations. The electronic properties of C6N7 depend on the doping atoms and doping sites. Furthermore, the effect of embedding of common nonmetal atoms such as B, C, N, S, O, Al, Si and P as well as transition metal including Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn atoms on the electronic and magnetic behavior of the C6N7 are studied. The charge transfer analysis shows that all embedded atoms act as electron donors, expect N, O and S atoms which act as electron acceptors when interacting with C6N7. The modification of the electronic band structure of C6N7 as the underlying mechanism for the changes in its electronic properties has been investigated. The intention is to demonstrate how entering the above mentioned impurities changes the nature of C6N7 into a metal, ferromagnetic-metal or dilute-magnetic semiconductor. These findings give not only an insight into the physical properties of doped and embedded C6N7 monolayer by different atoms, but also can serve as a guide to discover future possible applications of this novel material.",Applied Surface Science
Stabilizing effects of atomic Ti doping on high-voltage high-nickel layered oxide cathode for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press.High-voltage high-nickel lithium layered oxide cathodes show great application prospects to meet the ever-increasing demand for further improvement of the energy density of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) mainly due to their high output capacity. However, severe bulk structural degradation and undesired electrode-electrolyte interface reactions seriously endanger the cycle life and safety of the battery. Here, 2 mol% Ti atom is used as modified material doping into LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM) to reform LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.18Ti0.02O2 (NCM-Ti) and address the long-standing inherent problem. At a high cut-off voltage of 4.5 V, NCM-Ti delivers a higher capacity retention ratio (91.8% vs. 82.9%) after 150 cycles and a superior rate capacity (118 vs. 105 mAh·g-1) at the high current density of 10 C than the pristine NCM. The designed high-voltage full battery with graphite as anode and NCM-Ti as cathode also exhibits high energy density (240 Wh·kg-1) and excellent electrochemical performance. The superior electrochemical behavior can be attributed to the improved stability of the bulk structure and the electrode-electrolyte interface owing to the strong Ti-O bond and no unpaired electrons. The in-situ X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrates that Ti-doping inhibits the undesired H2-H3 phase transition, minimizing the mechanical degradation. The ex-situ TEM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that Ti-doping suppresses the release of interfacial oxygen, reducing undesired interfacial reactions. This work provides a valuable strategic guideline for the application of high-voltage high-nickel cathodes in LIBs.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research
The effect of NiO-Ni3N interfaces in in-situ formed heterostructure ultrafine nanoparticles on enhanced polysulfide regulation in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and AstronauticsInhibiting the “shuttle effect” of soluble polysulfides and improving reaction kinetics are the key factors necessary for further exploration of high-performance Li-S batteries. Herein, an effective interface engineering strategy is reported, wherein nitriding of an Ni-based precursor is controlled to enhance Li-S cell regulation. The resulting in-situ formed NiO-Ni3N heterostructure interface not only has a stronger polysulfide adsorption effect than that of monomeric NiO or Ni3N but also has a faster Li ion diffusion ability than a simple physical mixture. More importantly, this approach couples the respective advantages of NiO and Ni3N to reduce polarization and facilitate electron transfer during polysulfide reactions and synergistically catalyze polysulfide conversion. In addition, ultrafine nanoparticles are thought to effectively improve the use of additive materials. In summary, Li-S batteries based on this NiO-Ni3N heterostructure have the features of long cycle stability, rapid charging-discharging, and good performance under high sulfur loading.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Biomass-assisted approach for large-scale construction of multi-functional isolated single-atom site catalysts,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press.In recent years, the isolated single-atom site (ISAS) catalysts have attracted much attention as they are cost-effective, can achieve 100% atom-utilization efficiency, and often display superior catalytic performance. Here, we developed a biomass-assisted pyrolysis-etching-activation (PEA) strategy to construct ISAS metal decorated on N and B co-doped porous carbon (ISAS M/NBPC, M = Co, Fe, or Ni) catalysts. This PEA strategy can be applied in the universal and large-scale preparation of ISAS catalysts. Interestingly, the ISAS M/NBPC (M = Co, Fe, or Ni) catalysts show multi-functional features and excellent catalytic activities. They can be used to conduct different types of catalytic reactions, such as O-silylation (OSI), oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), and transfer hydrogenation (THG). In addition, we used the transfer hydrogenation of nitrobenzene as a typical reaction and revealed the difference between ISAS Co/NBPC and ISAS Co/NPC (N-doped porous carbon) catalysts by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and which showed that the decreased barrier of the ratedetermining step and the low-lying potential energy diagram indicate that the catalytic activity is higher when ISAS Co/NBPC is used than that when ISAS Co/NPC is used. These results demonstrate that the catalytic performance can be effectively improved by adjusting the coordination environment around the ISAS.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research

Utilizing waste duckweed from phytoremediation to synthesize highly efficient Fe–Nx–C catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Duckweed is a universal aquatic plant to remove nitrogen source pollutants in the field of phytoremediation. Due to the naturally abundant nitrogen, synthesis of carbon materials from duckweed would be a high-value approach. In oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of metal-air batteries and fuel cells, non-noble metals and heteroatoms co-doped electrocatalysts with excellent catalytic activity and remarkable stability are promising substitutes for Pt-based catalysts. The first-class ORR performance is determined by appropriate pore structure and active sites, which are strongly associated with the feasible synthesis methods. Herein, a facile one-step synthesis strategy for the transition metals- and nitrogen-codoped carbon (M–Nx–C) based catalysts with hierarchically porous structure was developed. The M–Nx–C (M = Fe, Co, Ni, and Mn) active sites were constructed and Fe–Nx–C (D-ZB-Fe) was the best electrocatalyst with excellent ORR performance. Results showed that D-ZB-Fe exhibited an obvious honeycomb porous structure with specific surface area of 1342.91 m2·g−1 and total pore volume of 1.085 cm3·g−1. It also possessed considerable active atoms and sites, where the proportion of pyridine N and graphite N was up to 72.9%. The above feature made for a superior ORR electrocatalytic activity. In specific, the onset and half-wave potential were 0.974 V and 0.857 V vs. RHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode), respectively. When compared with performances of commercial Pt/C, the four-electron pathway and relatively low peroxide yield, ca. 5%, were almost equivalent. Furthermore, D-ZB-Fe showed an excellent stability and remarkably methanol tolerance by the durability test. In conclusion, this research provides a new synthesis strategy of electrocatalysts with porous structures and active sites.",Science of the Total Environment
Efficiently catalyzed sea urchin-like mixed phase SmMn2O5/MnO2 for oxygen reduction reaction in zinc-air battery,"© 2022In this work, sea urchin-like SmMn2O5/MnO2 is synthesized by the hydrothermal method. Compared with SmMn2O5, SmMn2O5/MnO2 has a half wave potential of 0.82 V (vs RHE), which shows excellent electrocatalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the alkaline media. More importantly, the composite of SmMn2O5/MnO2 shows higher number of electron transfers, better stability of ORR, and stronger methanol-tolerant ability comparison with the commercial catalyst of Pt/C. The remarkable ORR activity is due to the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies and Mn3+, which are beneficial to the adsorption of oxygen species and the activation of O-O bond. The sea urchin-like morphology increases the specific surface area, and the tip-like synapses play an essential role in charge accumulation and rapid transfer. Moreover, the rechargeable zinc-air battery made of SmMn2O5/MnO2 not only has a high peak power density, but also has excellent cycle stability of 450 h in long-term charge discharge measurement.",Materials Research Bulletin
Two-dimensional square metal organic framework as promising cathode material for lithium-sulfur battery with high theoretical energy density,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as new generation of energy storage which offer cost-effectiveness and high energy density. However, their commercialization is restricted due to a host of challenges associated with the cathode material which usually contains sulfur with several drawbacks, including a low electronic conductivity of sulfur, the ‘shuttle effect’, and a large volume expansion during discharge. Herein, a novel two-dimensional porphyrin-like square metal organic framework (MOF) was explored as a promising cathode material using first principles density function theory (DFT) assisted by genetic global search. The DFT results show that, among 7 kinds of transition-metal organic framework (TM-MOF), only V-MOF and Ru-MOF is found to possess considerable chemical interactions with S8 and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in both vacuum and in electrolytic solvents, demonstrating distinguishable anchoring performance. The genetic global search and further DFT calculations indicate that the lithiation process on V-MOF exhibited a nearly constant open-circuit voltage of about 1.92 V to 1.95 V, and the theoretical energy density could reach up to 1469 Wh kg−1 when lithiation of S8 is considered on both sides of the substrate. The volume expansion of V-MOF during discharge is found to be about 34%, much smaller than 80% for solid sulfur. The band structure and density of states of V-MOF suggest metallic properties or a small band gap for bare surface or during the lithiation process. These results indicate that two-dimensional (2D) V-MOFs can serve as high-performance cathode material with distinguished anchoring performance to block polysulfide dissolution and thereby reduce the ‘shuttle effect’, and help attain ultra-high energy density. Our work points the way for designing and providing experimental realization of 2D layered materials applied in cathode with high energy density and stability.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Compared with typical electrospun carbon nanofiber composites, the as-prepared C@Ni/MnO composite fibers as interlayer enable MnO and Ni to contact fully with polysulfides rather than provide local contact surface. With the sulfur loading of 1.6 mg cm−2 and the approximately 0.1 g composite fibers as interlayer, the cathode shows initial capacity of 687.36 mAh g−1 at 0.5C and superior capacity retention of 70%.

Theoretical studies of MXene-supported single-atom catalysts: Os1/Ti2CS2 for low-temperature CO oxidation MXene负载的锇单原子催化剂Os1/Ti2CS2催化低温 CO氧化反应的理论研究,"© 2021, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.We report herein a new sulfur-functionalized MXene Ti2C (Ti2CS2)-supported osmium-metal single-atom catalyst (SAC) Os1/Ti2CS2 with high low-temperature catalytic activity for CO oxidation. Using periodic density functional theory calculations, the most stable SAC, Os1/Ti2CS2, has been screened from a series of group 8–11 transition metal SACs M1/Ti2CS2 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu; Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag; Os, Ir, Pt, Au). The calculations show that it is favorable for O2 and CO to be coadsorbed on the Os1 single atom (SA) of Os1/Ti2CS2 and the adsorption energy of the first O2 molecule is slightly higher than that of CO. Moreover, the termolecular co-adsorption of O2 + 2CO on Os1 SA is also possible, which is favorable for CO oxidation on Os1 SA through a novel three-molecule reaction mechanism. Accordingly, four different catalytic mechanisms, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H), Eley-Rideal (E-R), termolecular Langmuir-Hinshelwood-A (TLH-A) and termolecular Langmuir-Hinshelwood-B (TLH-B), are systematically studied for CO oxidation by O2 on Os1/Ti2CS2. The theoretical studies indicate that the TLH-B mechanism is the most feasible for CO oxidation with the reaction barrier energy of only 0.74 eV, which is far lower than for L-H, E-R and TLH-A with barrier energies of 1.06, 1.09 and 1.47 eV, respectively. The results provide fundamental understanding to the surface chemistry of MXene and designing new sulfur-functionalized two-dimensional MXene catalytic nanomaterials.

However, it has been an important problem for researchers because of its slow decomposition kinetics and difficult to generalize to practical application. Herein, we prepared copper polyphthalocyanine-carbon nanotubes composites (CuPPc-CNTs) by solvothermal in-situ polymerization of copper phthalocyanine on the surface of carbon nanotubes as cathode for reversible Li-CO2 batteries, which exhibits a high discharge capacity of 18,652.7 mAh·g−1 at current density of 100 mA·g−1, 1.64 V polarization at 1,000 mA·g−1, and a stable cycles number of 160 is close to 1,630 h of charge-discharge process at 200 mA·g−1. Copper polyphthalocyanine has highly efficient copper single-atom catalytic sites with excellent CO2 adsorption and activation, while carbon nanotubes provide a conductive network. The synergistic effect of the two compounds enables it to have excellent catalytic activity. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation proved that the addition of copper polyphthalocyanine significantly improved the CO2 adsorption and activation process.

Ultrafast Joule heating synthesis of hierarchically porous graphene-based Co-N-C single-atom monoliths,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Herein, we develop a transient heating-quenching strategy triggered by Joule heating for the synthesis of single-atom cobalt- and nitrogen-doped graphene materials with three-dimensional porous monolithic architecture (denoted as CoNG-JH). The ultrafast Joule heating procedure simultaneously enables the reduction of graphene oxide and the incorporation of metal and nitrogen atoms into the graphene matrix within 2-second period. Meanwhile, the transient quenching avoids the extended heating-induced atom aggregation, ensuring the rapid and stable dispersion of atomic-scale CoNx active sites in graphene. Additionally, the interconnected macropores and nanopores formed by the self-assembly of graphene sheets facilitate the unimpeded ion and gas transport during the catalytic process. When used as an electrode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the fabricated freestanding CoNG-JH exhibits high catalytic activity and durability with a low overpotential of 106 mV at 10 mA·cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 66 mV·dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte.

The regulation of coordination structure between cobalt and nitrogen on graphene for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysis in Zn-air batteries,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesElectrocatalysts with atomically dispersed metal moieties are of importance in enhancing electrocatalysis for a specific reaction including oxygen reduction. However, it is still challenging to modulate the coordination structure of metal atoms with heteroatoms on carbon supports. Herein, an innovative and facile bridging strategy to regulate the coordination structure of cobalt with nitrogen atoms on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets was developed by the interfacial complexation of amino-rich folic acid with cobalt ions on graphene oxide sheets and the subsequent thermal treatment. Typically, the actual coordination interaction between cobalt and nitrogen species was revealed by using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), exhibiting the Co-N4 coordination structure well-dispersed on reduced graphene oxide. Such unique structure enables the efficient oxygen reduction and evolution reactions via the favorable adsorption and desorption of intermediates. With the enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic activities, the fabricated Zn-air battery exhibited the excellent performance with large power density of 319.8 mW cm−2 and good long-term stability (over 300 h). This work establishes the synthesis strategy for bridging metal atom with heteroatom on graphene sheets to enhance the bifunctional electrocatalysis toward Zn-air batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

A Critical Review on Materials and Fabrications of Thermally Stable Separators for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Li-ion batteries nowadays are widely used as energy storage systems owing to their high power and energy densities. However, the safety of Li-ion batteries has increasingly become a grave concern, and how to effectively mitigate or avoid the thermal runaway of Li-ion batteries, particularly during fast charging/discharging, is a critical issue. It has been pointed out that among various factors governing the safety of Li-ion batteries, the thermal stability of separators plays an important role.

Pt NPs-loaded siloxene nanosheets for hydrogen co-evolutions from Zn-H2O fuel cells-powered water-splitting,"© 2021Siloxene features abundant functional groups and oxygen vacancies, which facilitates the ultrafine platinum nanoparticles loading for catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a siloxene-p-Pt-2 h composite has been fabricated with an ultralow platinum loading on siloxene (0.56 wt%), which shows greatly enhanced HER activity featuring an ultralow overpotential (η10 = 23 mV). Attractively, the siloxene-p-Pt-2 h has been applied as a HER catalyst in a Zn-H2O fuel cell, demonstrating a high power density of 157 mW cm−2 in coupling with the cathode hydrogen evolution. Moreover, a coupled configuration between two Zn-H2O fuel cells in series and the cell-powered hydroxide electrolyzer achieves the efficient hydrogen co-productions co-catalyzed by the HER catalysts. The excellent HER performance is attributed to the hydrophilic character and the optimal Gibbs free energy via the strong interaction between the siloxene and platinum nanoparticles.

Visible light enhanced thermocatalytic CO + NO reaction over metastable NiCo2O4 catalyst,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.A NiCo2O4 catalyst was evaluated for CO + NO reaction under a photo-thermal synergistic effect. Compared with crystalline samples, metastable NiCo2O4 with a crystalline/amorphous heterostructure exhibited higher catalytic activity due to its better low temperature reducibility and more oxygen vacancies (VOs). The collective TPR, XPS, and in-situ DRIFTS results revealed that more VOs induced by CO directly interacting with the lattice oxygen of NiCo2O4 could promote NO adsorption and activation, and visible light irradiation further reinforced the above processes by facilitating CO to capture lattice oxygen and enriching electrons in VOs. With the increase in reaction temperature, the electron-rich VOs could further drive NO dissociation into N2. Herein, the VOs was not only an active center of catalytic reaction, but also acted as a bridge between CO and NO for lattice oxygen circulation. Thus, a photo-thermal synergistic effect for NO reduction by CO occurred over metastable NiCo2O4.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
High-density ultrafine RuP2 with strong catalyst-support interaction driven by dual-ligand and tungsten-oxygen sites for hydrogen evolution at 1 A cm−2,"© 2021Ultrafine and high-density RuP2 based on coordination chemistry and catalyst-support correlation shows potential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the uniform and high-density W-doped ultra-small RuP2 (W0.05-RuP2@C3N4-NC) are synthesized by incorporating oxygen-bridged [WO4] tetrahedron into tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-melamino-formaldehyde (MF) ligands. EDTA-MF shows strong metal-support interaction, dedicating to the optimal dispersion, highest Ru yields, and HER activity. W atoms regulate local electron structure and coordination environment, leading to faster proton supply and hydrogen release, thus achieving 10 mA cm−2 at low overpotential of 27 mV (alkaline) and 66 mV (acidic). Notably, W0.05-RuP2@C3N4-NC maintains stability with staged 500–1000 mA cm−2 for 1000 h in alkaline, and 1000 mA cm−2 for ~300 h in acid, ascribing to the immobilized ultra-stable RuP2 nanoclusters via EDTA-MF and metal-oxygen sites. The excellent activity and stability hold promise for industrial hydrogen production, which provides deeper insights into catalyst-support interaction and reasonable design of high Ru-loading electrocatalysts.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

Self-Healing: An Emerging Technology for Next-Generation Smart Batteries,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Energy Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Complex battery degradation is an interplay of different processes correlated to the thermodynamic, chemical, and mechanical instability of materials. Their degradation kinetics and mechanisms are functions of several intrinsic and environmental conditions. The degradation of the battery cell can be minimized by using preventive steps, like artificial interphases, coatings, additives, or materials that operate within the thermodynamic stability voltage window. Like in most systems/applications degradation processes/aging cannot be avoided since battery cells operate in different environments. Self-healing functionalities have been proved in different areas of material science and they can significantly improve the performance of battery cells. Some of them have been demonstrated on the laboratory scale, while other degradation processes have been tackled only by the development of preventive approaches. Since self-healing functionalities add additional weight and cost to the battery cell, directions of development should be focused on modification of nonactive materials, preferably based on biosourced materials to lower environmental impact. Important issues include detection of degradation using sensors and the vectorization of self-healing components and their controlled release. In addition to this, a triggering process of extrinsic self-healing components together with manufacturability and recyclability should be considered from the early stages of the development phase.",Advanced Energy Materials
Exploring anchoring performance of defective MgO nanotubes for lithium–sulphur batteries: A density functional theory (DFT) study,"© 2021 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.In recent years, lithium–sulphur batteries have received great attention due to their high theoretical specific capacity. In the exploration of improving battery performance, developing suitable anchoring materials is one of the ways to suppress the shuttle effect which is one of the main problems of lithium–sulphur batteries. In this work, we investigated the anchoring ability of MgO nanotubes (MgONT) and defective MgO nanotubes (MgONTv) to lithium polysulphides (LiPSs) by density functional theory (DFT). The defect formation energy, the HOMO and LUMO of the defective MgONT, the energy difference (ΔE), and the adsorption energy were calculated. The optimized structures of LiPSs adsorbed on the MgONT and MgONTv were also obtained. The calculation results show that MgONTv1 has a strong adsorption effect on LiPSs, and its adsorption energy ranges from −1.78 to −4.51 eV. The adsorption of LiPSs narrows the bandgap of MgONTv. In other words, the conductivity of MgONTv is better than the pristine one. Our study demonstrates that MgONTv has more robust adsorption performance for LiPSs, which is an effective addictive material for the cathode of lithium–sulphur batteries. It can provide a theoretical basis for exploring the application of new one-dimensional anchoring materials in the cathode of lithium–sulphur batteries.",Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering
Study the Adsorption of Letrozole Drug on the Silicon Doped Graphdiyne Monolayer: a DFT Investigation,"© 2021, Springer Nature B.V.In the current study, by employing first-principles computations, the adsorption behavior of letrozole (LET) was investigated on the pristine graphdiyne nanosheet (GDY) as well as Si-doped graphdiyne (SiGDY). According to the adsorption energy, charge transfer value, and the change in the bang gap energy, the tendency of the pristine GDY towards LET is insignificant. However, the interaction of LET with SiGDY was strong and the adsorption energy was approximately − 19.20 kcal/mol. In addition, the associated electrical conductivity with SiGDY increased by approximately 23.53 % following the adsorption of LET. The results show that SiGDY can be employed as an electronic sensor to detect LET. Furthermore, LET is detected by SiGDY in the water phase based on the magnitude of solvation energy. Finally, a considerable charge-transfer between LET and SiGDY is a precondition for the adsorption of the LET molecule with proper binding energies, which delivers the Si atoms with a significant positive charge.",Silicon
Advanced porous borocarbonitride nanoarchitectonics: Their structural designs and applications,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdBorocarbonitride (BCN) based materials are finding increasing attention for a range of applications owing to their outstanding features. BCN is generally realized through the coupling of carbon and boron nitride (BN) with the latter being analogous to graphene and recognized due to its good electrical/mechanical properties and thermal/chemical stability. Although BCN is widely acknowledged for tunable bandgap, one of its fascinating yet less explored aspects is porosity. The porous features including high surface area and pore size are always favorable factors to enhance the efficiency of non-porous materials. This review is focused on parallel coverage and comparison of BCN and BN in terms of their synthesis methods, structure-property relationships, and application perspectives. This review aims to provide the readers with up-to-date information on the aspects that have not been covered previously. The review also covers the detailed explanation and analysis of various factors affecting the structure and property relationship that could lead to the development of more advanced BCN nanoporous structures. In terms of the application perspectives, emerging fields such as energy storage and conversion and photocatalysis and conventional fields such as adsorption are covered and the review concludes by providing illustrations on current challenges and future directions.",Carbon
Enhancing the coupling effect in a sandwiched FeNiPS3/graphite catalyst derived from graphite intercalation compounds for efficient oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits the development of energy transfer technologies such as water splitting and zinc air batteries (ZABs). To this end, a cost-effective and highly active FeNiPS3/graphite layer (FeNiPS3/GL) sandwich-structure was designed and prepared by in situ transforming ferric and nickel chloride-based graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) through a solid-state reaction for catalyzing the OER. The obtained sandwich-structured FeNiPS3/GL catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 223 mV, a small Tafel slope of 58 mV dec−1, and durable stability. The outstanding performance of FeNiPS3/GL may be due to the coupling effect, the sandwich-structure and the active Ni doping that facilitate electron transfer, suppress the aggregation of FeNiPS3 and expose a massive number of edge active sites for enhancing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. The FeNiPS3/GL assembled ZAB also presents durable stability for 175 h and a stable energy efficiency of 61.9% for practical application. Therefore, the sandwich-structured FeNiPS3/GL optimizes the unexposed active sites, semiconducting nature and the inert basal plate shortages of metal phosphorus trisulfides, and provides a reference value for exploring more metal phosphorus trisulfides through in situ transformation of GICs as efficient catalysts.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Oxygen vacancy enabled fabrication of dual-atom Mn/Co catalysts for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryTo tackle the parasitic polysulfide shuttle effect of lithium sulfur batteries, we herein report a highly active Mn/Co-N-C catalyst with dual atom Mn/Co active sites coordinated on a N doped carbon support. Fabrication of Mn/Co-N-C is enabled by using cobalt doped, oxygen vacancy enriched MnO2 (Co-MnO2|Ov) as an initiator for aniline polymerization. The Co-MnO2|Ov initiator can release Co/Mn ions during the polymerization reaction and be used as a metal ion source for the catalyst; the oxygen vacancies can create abundant defects in the carbon structure resulting from pyrolysis of the synthesized polyaniline, which is conducive to increasing Mn/Co loading. The Li-S battery equipped with a Mn/Co-N-C modified separator exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1662 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and 625 mA h g−1 at 6C. The capacity of 816 mA h g−1 achieved at 2C decays only 0.036% per cycle after 1000 cycles. At a high sulfur loading of 14.1 mg cm−2, the battery yields capacities of 798.6 mA h g−1 and 7.566 mA h cm−2 at 0.1C, which are retained by 63.9% and 64.7%, respectively, after 110 cycles. DFT calculations reveal that the Mn/Co-N-C catalyst enhances the adsorption capacity and favors electron transfer. This work provides an effective, novel strategy to prepare a highly active Mn/Co-N-C dual-atom catalyst, which shows a good prospect for application in energy storage devices.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
"N, S-co-doped carbon/Co1-xS nanocomposite with dual-enzyme activities for a smartphone-based colorimetric assay of total cholesterol in human serum","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.We fabricated a novel N,S-co-doped carbon/Co1-xS nanocomposite (NSC/Co1-xS) using a facile sol-gel approach, which featured a multiporous structure, abundant S vacancies and Co-S nanoparticles filling the carbon-layer pores. When the Co1-xS nanoparticles were anchored onto the surface of N,S-co-doped carbon, a synergistic catalysis action occurred. The NSC/Co1-xS nanocomposites possessed both peroxidase-like and oxidase-mimetic dual-enzyme activities, in which the oxidase-mimetic activity dominated. By scavenger capture tests, the nanozyme was demonstrated to catalyze H2O2 to produce h+, •OH and •O2−, among which the strongest and weakest signals were h+ and •OH, respectively. The multi-valence states of Co atoms in the NSC/Co1-xS structure facilitated electronic transfer that enhanced redox reactions, thereby improving the resultant color reaction. Based on the NSC/Co1-xS's enzyme-mimetic catalytic reaction, a visual colorimetric assay and Android “Thing Identify” application (app), installed on a smartphone, offered detection limits of 1.93 and 2.51 mg/dl, respectively, in human serum samples. The selectivity/interference experiments, using fortified macromolecules and metal ions, demonstrated that this sensor had high selectivity and low interference potential for cholesterol analysis. Compared to standard assay kits and previously reported visual detection, the Android smartphone-based assays provided higher accuracy (recoveries up to 93.6–104.1%), feasibility for trace-level detection, and more convenient on-site application for cholesterol assay due to the superior enzymatic activity of NSC/Co1-xS. These compelling performance metrics lead us to posit that the NSC/Co1-xS-based nanozymic sensor offers a promising methodology for several practical applications, such as point-of-care diagnosis and workplace health evaluations.",Analytica Chimica Acta
Bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework derived magnetic catalyst for high-efficiency CO2 chemical fixation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMetal-organic framework (MOF) derived porous carbons are known as desirable catalysts for carbon dioxide (CO2) catalytic conversion. However, practical CO2 utilization processes are severely hampered by their powder form and relatively poor activities. Herein, we demonstrate the rational synthesis of ZnO and/or metallic Co embedded in N-doped porous carbon by one-step pyrolysis of bimetallic MOF, Co/Zn-ZIF. The optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and recyclability towards the coupling reaction of CO2 and epoxides owing to hierarchical pore, good CO2 uptake and sufficient active sites. More importantly, its catalytic performance can be well maintained even under dilute CO2 (15%), humid environment or light irradiation instead of heating. These results pave a way to develop highly efficient materials for practical CO2 catalytic conversion.",Chemical Engineering Science
Exploring the biotoxicity of carbon boride nanosheets (BC3) based on the villin headpiece protein model,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.The recently synthesized single-layer carbon boride (BC3), has been explored for biomedical applications. However, the interaction between BC3 and biomolecules needs to be further explored to evaluate its potential toxicity to biological systems. Here, using the villin headpiece (HP35) as a representative protein model, the binding behavior of proteins to BC3 and the structure evolution of proteins were studied by molecular dynamics simulation. Our data revealed that HP35 can quickly load and form stable binding to BC3 surface. The BC3 caused moderate destruction of the HP35 by destroying its native hydrogen bonds and unwinding its helices. The BC3/HP35 interaction strength is linearly correlated with the contact number between BC3 and HP35. HP35 forms binds to BC3 mainly through van der Waals interactions and π-πstacking. Compared to graphene, the polarized nature of BC3 can slightly strengthen the binding between BC3 and HP35. BC3 still faces the problem of potential cytotoxicity to biological system. These findings shed light on the biological effects of BC3 at the molecular level and guide the future application of BC3-based devices in biomedicine.",Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics
Cubic core-shell structure of NiCoSx/CoS2 as a high-efficiency tri-functional catalyst for Zn-air battery and overall water splitting,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryCubic core-shell NiCoSx/CoS2 composite catalyst was successfully prepared on the basis of K3[Co(CN)6]. First, Ni2+ is substituted for K+ in K3[Co(CN)6]2 to prepare the binary metal ion precursor of Ni3[Co(CN)6]2. Afterward, coating Co(OH)2 on the surface of Ni3[Co(CN)6]2 could not only maintain the cubic structure of Prussian blue analogue but also build a composite interface between two phases. After the Ni3[Co(CN)6]2/Co(OH)2 precursor is sulfided, a porous NiCoSx/CoS2 composite catalyst material with a cubic structure is obtained. NiCoSx/CoS2 catalysts showed excellent oxygen evolution reactions and oxygen reduction reactions. The overpotential was only 310 mV to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm−2 and the half-wave potential can reach 0.80 V. During the exploration of the hydrogen evolution reaction, the catalyst exhibited 253 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2. When this catalyst was used in Zn-air batteries as the cathode, it showed excellent cycle stability (210 h) and small voltage gap (0.80 V) at 5 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, soft-pack flexible batteries assembled with NiCoSx/CoS2 can be charged and discharged stably at any bending angle.",CrystEngComm
Two-in-one template-assisted construction of hollow phosphide nanotubes for electrochemical energy storage,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.In this work, a template-assisted method was used to develop novel Ni2P@PANI hollow nanotubes as a positive electrode material for supercapacitors using prepared polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes as precursors, and their electrochemical behavior was studied. The results revealed that the Ni2P@PANI nanotube electrode exhibited an average high specific capacity of 866 C g−1 at 2 A g−1. The experimental data were combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reveal that the strong interaction between PANI and Ni2P may lead to the formation of novel bonds at their interface and promote the redistribution of charges within the electrode, improving the capacitive properties. The combination of PANI and Ni2P facilitated the adsorption and desorption of OH−, resulting in a rapid Faraday redox reaction at the electrodes. Additionally, a unique Fe2O3@PNCT hollow nanotube was fabricated as the negative electrode with the same PANI nanotube precursor. Thus, a “two-in-one” strategy was implemented. The assembled quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited a high energy density of 60.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 852.3 W kg−1 and a high-capacity retention rate of 79.8% after 10 000 cycles.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers
Powder Coatings via Atomic Layer Deposition for Batteries: A Review,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Rechargeable batteries have emerged as the most promising energy storage devices in response to continually growing modern demands and are still being researched to attain higher energy densities, structural stability, and longer cycling and calendar life. Owing to the fact that battery electrodes are developed from various types of powders, incorporation of functional nanocoating of suitable materials on powder materials and/or nanosynthesis of active powder constituents have shown promising results regarding the aforementioned challenges associated with modern battery technology. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been demonstrated to be highly effective in fabricating inorganic films even at the subnanoscale, not only on flat surfaces but also on individual particles with high conformity, uniformity, and self-limiting growth, thus providing exceptional control over film thickness. Unlike conventional wet-chemical processes, powder ALD offers a unique opportunity to develop nano- and subnanoscale films of various compositions over a variety of substrate particles regardless of their size, morphology, and composition. Proper modifications made by powder ALD process are known to induce improvements in structural stability, electronic and ionic conductivity at the interface, and consequent charge-discharge properties of the batteries. This review comprehensively covers the main strategies and materials used over time to improve the performance of various types of batteries utilizing the powder ALD process.",Chemistry of Materials
Investigating the Biological Effect of Multidimensional Ti3C2(MXene)-Based Nanomaterials through a Metabolomics Approach: A Multidimensional-Determined Alteration in Energy Metabolism,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Multidimensional Ti3C2(MXene)-based nanomaterials (m-MBNs, including nanosheets and quantum dots (QDs)) are vitally important transition-metal carbides or carbonitrides with dramatic photothermal activity in cancer therapy in animal models and display potential prospects for practical application. However, detailed bioinformation on multidimensional-induced variations in biocompatibility, metabolic processes, and mechanisms is insufficient. Metabolomics profiling has provided a distinguished alternative with massive bioinformation, which has shed light on the biological response of an organism under exogenous stimuli at the molecular level. In this work, m-MBNs were selected to interact with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), among which a metabolomics approach was applied to explore the changes in the HUVECs metabolome. The spatial distribution of metabolites was screened by desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI). The results revealed that nonobvious acute cytotoxicity was observed by cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. Comparatively, m-MBNs induced changes in the energy metabolism-related cellular events of HUVECs, while MXene QDs induced significant variation in cell metabolism, which was correlated with the multidimensional-determined mitochondria dysfunction. This work has the potential to evaluate metabolomic changes as a result of exposure to m-MBNs for assessing the biological effect of nanomaterials at the micro level. Moreover, such metabolomics-based profiling could also provide a biological forward expectation of these nanomaterials in future biomedical applications.",Chemistry of Materials
Sulfur Reduction Catalyst Design Inspired by Elemental Periodic Expansion Concept for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The key challenges facing the commercialization of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are shortening the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediate existence time while accelerating solid-phase conversion reactions. Herein, inspired by highly efficient natural enzymes with Fe/N active sites for oxygen reduction reactions, we report a periodic expansion catalysis concept, i.e., Ru and P synergic stereoselectivity, for designing sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) catalysts. As a proof of concept, a RuP2-configuration molecular catalyst was exploited to assemble an interlayer in Li-S batteries that adsorbs LiPSs, optimizes Li+ migration paths, and catalyzes SRRs. Comprehensive investigation identified the elimination of steric hindrance and strong electron orbital couplings between metallic d band and nonmetallic p band as the main contributing factors of PEC for the SRRs. As a result, the Li-S battery with ∼0.5 wt % catalyst additive showed enhanced cycling stability even under a high sulfur loading (6.5 mg cm-2) and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (9 μL mg-1).",ACS Nano
Confined Ultrafine Pt in Porous Carbon Fibers and Their N-Enhanced Heavy d-πEffect,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The heavy d-πeffect is an important theoretical model for strong Pt-C interaction, and its enhancement is critical to the high-performance design of Pt/C electrocatalysts. Common chemical N-doping to the carbon support can provide possibilities for enhanced electrocatalysis but most often leads to random interaction with Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) and uncontrollable tuning of the heavy d-πeffect. Directional confinement of Pt-NPs within N-doped carbon to directly enhance the heavy d-πeffect is therefore mostly preferred but rarely reported. Herein, confined ultrafine Pt-NPs in N-doped porous carbon fibers (Pt@NDPCF) were obtained by a combination method involving electrospinning, carbonization, and directional replacement. Such a synthetic strategy leads to highly dispersed, ultrafine Pt-NPs in hierarchically porous carbon fibers and a strong directional interaction of Pt with pyridinic N, which significantly enhances the heavy d-πeffect, greatly facilitating electron transfer and optimizing Pt 5d orbitals. Based on these advances, Pt@NDPCF exhibited outstanding activity and superior durability in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with 24 mV lower overpotential at 10 mA cm-2and a much smaller activity loss after 10,000 cycles of durability tests in comparison with a commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work sheds new lights on the design of high-performance Pt-based nanomaterials toward HER or other practical applications.",Chemistry of Materials
Bimetallic sites and coordination effects: electronic structure engineering of NiCo-based sulfide for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural electrooxidation,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryBimetallic-sites construction and coordination species tuning are considered as effective strategies to improve electrocatalytic performance of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation. However, it remains a challenging issue to clarify the roles of dual-sites and coordinating anions through optimized electronic structure. Herein, hierarchical NiCo-based sulfide (NiCo-S) nanosheets are reported to disclose the composition-dependent activity at the atomic level. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) evaluates the tuned electronic configuration. Electrochemical experimental and theoretical results manifest that Ni-Co dual sites synergistically participate in HMF oxidation, where Co sites promote the transformation of the aldehyde (CH 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 11111111 00000000 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000 O) group to the carboxyl group with the strong diatomic adsorption (O and C atoms) on the CH O group of HMF, while Ni sites speed up the reaction rate of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) generation. Meanwhile, the coordinating S species also contributes to the formation of strong diatomic adsorption with the CH O group of HMF, and a larger density of state (DOS) of NiCo-S at the Fermi level demonstrates a higher conductivity for carrier transfer compared with NiCo-O. All the above studies confirm the effects of the Ni-Co dual-sites and S coordination on accelerating reactions and lowering energy barriers, thus facilitating the catalytic activity (98.0% selectivity and 97.1% yield for FDCA) with rapid reaction kinetics and low onset potential (1.2 V vs. RHE).",Catalysis Science and Technology
Enhancing the Bidirectional Reaction Kinetics of Polysulfides by Mott-Schottky-like Electrocatalysts with Rich Heterointerfaces,"© 2022 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.Designing a well-functional host material to effectively overcome all of the energy barriers in the overall 16-electron sulfur conversion reaction remains elusive in current Li-S batteries (LSBs).

The target sample of MH-NCB fulfills the smooth bidirectional electrocatalysis of sulfur species in LSBs by the coexistence of enriched heterointerfaces among MoO2/Mo2C and similar ""Mott-Schottky""catalysts formed between ultrafine metallic Mo and NCB due to difference in their work functions. The as-obtained MH-NCB harvests an impressive rate capability (593.9 mAh g-1 at 3C) and favorable cycling stability (724.9 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 1C) at a high sulfur content of 70.2 wt % in the composite.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
Highly Elastic and Polar Block Polymer Binder Enabling Accommodation of Volume Change and Confinement of Polysulfide for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling and sulfur volume change causing degradation of electrodes have hindered the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries. Here, a highly elastic and polar block polymer binder, poly(acrylic acid)-b-((poly(n-butyl acrylate)-co-poly(2,2,3,4,4,4-hexafluorobutyl acrylate))-b-poly(acrylic acid) (PAA-b-(PnBA-co-PHFBA)-b-PAA), was designed and synthesized to both accommodate sulfur volume change and confine LiPSs. The rigid-soft modulated triblock polymer combined the traditional polar binder PAA, low glass-temperature PnBA, and high-polarity PHFBA. The resultant binder can not only adjust the striking volume expansion and inhibit disintegration of a pure sulfur cathode but also strongly anchor LiPSs. The cycle stability and rate performance of lithium-sulfur batteries were significantly improved after being incorporated with the multifunctional binder. Besides, abundant F atoms can enhance ionic conductivity to improve electrochemical reaction of the sulfur cathode. This work offers a feasible and effective strategy for designing an efficient multifunctional binder toward building next-generation high energy density lithium-sulfur batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials

All rights reserved.The lithium-sulfur battery is considered to be a prospective candidate for the next-generation energy storage system. The practical application of the lithium-sulfur battery is impeded by several existing challenges, especially the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) ""shuttle effect,"" which leads to low utilization of sulfur and poor cycle life. To alleviate the ""shuttle effect"", herein, we fabricate a nanoporous metal-nitrogen-carbon catalyst, that is, Co-N-C, combined with graphene (G) as a multifunctional separator coating layer. The Co-N-C/G interlayer exhibits several merits to improve the battery performance, including (1) nanoporous structure that facilitates ionic transport, (2) abundant Co active sites and polar nitrogen-rich carbon surface that can adsorb and immobilize LiPSs, (3) highly dispersed Co sites that are able to accelerate the sulfur redox reaction kinetics, and (4) excellent electrical conductivity for further sulphur utilization.

Dual-Anion Doping Enables NiSe2Electrocatalysts to Accelerate Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The quest for efficient electrocatalysts to accelerate hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of immense importance for global sustainability. Transition-metal-based selenides, especially NiSe2, are considered as one of the most promising HER catalysts due to their cost-effectiveness and superior conductivity, yet their inherent activity is poor. Herein, we reasonably designed and synthesized self-supported fluorine-phosphorus dual-anion co-doped NiSe2nanosheets grown on carbon cloth (F/P-NiSe2/CC) with excellent HER performance. The obtained F/P-NiSe2only requires low overpotentials of 53 and 137 mV to obtain current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm-2, respectively, as well as a gentle Tafel slope of 95.6 mV dec-1, and can sustain at least 120 h operation in alkaline media. Experimental analyses and density functional theory calculations have cross-proven that the electronic configuration of NiSe2is successfully modulated by co-doping, which effectively improves the conductivity, optimizes hydrogen adsorption energy (ΔGH*), and makes it easier to get over the rate-limiting obstacle.

Rich and uncovered FeNx atom clusters anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets for highly efficient and stable oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.It is still challenging but essential to synthesize non-noble catalysts with rich and uncovered catalytic active sites towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). And the limited research of the ORR properties of FeNx atom clusters also hinders their practical implementations. Here, we report a two-dimensional (2D) non-precious ORR catalyst constructed by abundant and fully exposed FeNx atom clusters anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets (Fe-N-C/NG), which derives from three-dimensional (3D) ZIF-8, 2D graphene oxide nanosheet, and ferrocene. The optimized Fe-N-C/NG delivers outstanding ORR activities (Eonset = 0.97 V, E1/2 = 0.84 V, Jd = 5.48 mA cm−2), excellent Tafel slope (57.7 mV dec−1), remarkable long-term durability, and strong methanol tolerance in an alkaline electrolyte. Its superior catalytic activity is possibly attributed to its unique conversion of nanoarchitecture and the synergistic effects: the change of morphology effectively utilizes the advantages of 2D graphene oxide and 3D ZIF-8, which guarantees sufficient and reachable active sites; the 2D porous nanoarchitecture of Fe-N-C/NG promotes the ion diffusion and mechanical stability; both the FeNx atom clusters and N-doped graphene nanosheets facilitate the catalytic activity. This work introduces an innovative strategy to rationally design the nanoarchitecture and facilely synthesize nonprecious ORR catalysts with sufficient and uncovered active sites for high efficiency and durability.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
NiSe2@NiO heterostructure with optimized electronic structure as efficient electrocatalyst for lithium-oxygen batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.With high theoretical energy density, rechargeable lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries are considered to be the most promising energy storage and conversion system. However, its development is seriously hampered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in notorious overpotential and mediocre cycle stability. Here, we elaborately design the free-standing NiSe2 @NiO heterostructure on conductive carbon cloth as oxygen electrode for Li-O2 batteries. The electronic redistribution at the interface between NiSe2 and NiO caused by the strong electronic interaction can strengthen electron transfer and optimize the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates, thereby immensely boosting the ORR/OER kinetics. Therefore, Li-O2 batteries with NiSe2 @NiO oxygen electrodes show the highly discharge capacity of 11512 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1 and outstanding stability of over 360 h. This work enriches the understanding on the influence of electronic structure modulation of heterostructural transition metal dichalcogenides on their catalytic activity towards oxygen electrode reactions in Li-O2 batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Nitrogen-doped 3D hollow carbon spheres for efficient selective oxidation of C-H bonds under mild conditions,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryHeteroatom-doped carbon-based materials are considered to be efficient metal-free catalysts for diverse organic synthetic reactions. However, compared with metal-based catalysts, there are still gaps in the catalytic performance of metal-free catalysts in the selective catalytic oxidation of C-H bonds. Herein, nitrogen-doped 3D hollow carbon spheres (N-HCSs) were prepared by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. And the effects of deposition temperature, nitrogen content and pore structure on the catalytic performance are systematically investigated. For the model oxidation reaction of ethylbenzene, the obtained catalyst shows 98.4% conversion of ethylbenzene and 99.5% selectivity of acetophenone at 50 °C. The abundant mesopores and modest graphite nitrogen content are confirmed to be beneficial for improving their catalytic activity in the selective oxidation of C-H bonds.",New Journal of Chemistry
NiPN/Ni Nanoparticle-Decorated Carbon Nanotube Forest as an Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting in an Alkaline Electrolyte,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.In this work, a multi-interfacial nickel phosphide-nitride/nickel (NiPN/Ni) nanoparticle (NP)-decorated P,N-doped carbon nanotube (CNT) forest on carbon cloth (NiPN/Ni/CC-CNT2) with a high electrochemical active surface area was synthesized by a facile two-step approach involving the CNT forest growth with a subsequent controlled phosphorization/nitridation procedure, in which the initially loaded Ni species (active sites for growing CNT forest) serve as a precursor for synthesizing NiPN/Ni NP active species on CNT forest for water electrolysis. This is the first example that the loaded Ni sites for CNT forest growth were directly converted to active species for water electrolysis rather than be removed by acid treatment, which fully utilizes Ni resources and simultaneously avoids the waste acid environmental pollution. Thanks to the promoted mass/electron transfer by the CNT forest structure and the improved intrinsic activity by the multi-interfacial synergistic effect of nickel phosphide-nitride and nickel, the resultant NiPN/Ni/CC-CNT2shows high activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, η10= 56 mV and η100= 186 mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, η10= 204 mV and η100= 266 mV) in an alkaline medium. In addition, the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer with NiPN/Ni/CC-CNT2as both the anode and cathode delivers low cell voltages of 1.49 and 1.74 V for 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively, associated with an excellent electrocatalytic durability for overall water splitting. The developed low-cost bifunctional NiPN/Ni/CC-CNT2outperforms most of the reported electrocatalysts in literature and performs even better than the Pt and RuO2benchmark electrocatalysts for HER and OER, respectively, at a large current density. Therefore, the fabricated NiPN/Ni/CC-CNT2has shown great potential for large-scale commercial production of green hydrogen as a clean and renewable fuel to support the carbon neutralization strategy.",ACS Applied Nano Materials
Synergistic Electronic Effects in AuCo Nanoparticles Stabilized in a Triazine-Based Covalent Organic Framework: A Catalyst for Methyl Orange and Methylene Blue Reduction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Developing stable active catalysts for reducing water-soluble pollutants is a desirable target. In this pursuit, we have functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with gold (Au) and cobalt (Co) nanoparticles via a one-step aqueous synthesis process, and their catalytic activity in reducing methyl orange and methylene blue is examined. Operando absorbance measurements of methyl orange (anionic dye) reduction revealed AuCoCOF (1.3 Au/1.0 Co) to have superior kinetics over many other catalysts, which typically require additional external stimuli (e.g., photons) and higher catalyst loadings. After confirming the homogeneous dispersion of the nanoparticles on the COF support using three-dimensional (3D) tomography and material stability through powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), infrared (IR), and thermal studies, we investigated their redox activity. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) confirmed the involvement of both metals in the redox process, while spectroelectrochemical measurements show that their activity and kinetics remain unaltered by an applied potential. Solid-state UV measurements reveal that the neat COF is a semiconductor with a large band gap (2.8 eV), which is substantially lowered when loaded with cobalt nanoparticles (2.2 eV for CoCOF). The electronic synergy between Au and Co nanoparticles further reduces the band gap of AuCoCOF (1.9 eV). Thus, there is a definite advantage in doping non-noble metal nanoparticles into a noble metal lattice and nanoconfining them into a porous COF support. Our study highlights the significance of bimetallic COF-supported nanocatalysts, wherein one can engage each component toward targeted applications that demand redox activity with favorable kinetics.",ACS Applied Nano Materials
Hybrid MoS2+ xNanosheet/Nanocarbon Heterostructures for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Modulation of electron/ion transport in electrodes through the appropriate mesoscale electrode structural design is essential to achieving effective utilization of nanoscale electroactive materials. Herein, nanosheet MoS2+x/carbon [one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotube (CNT) or two-dimensional (2D) graphene nanoplatelet (GNP)] heterostructures are prepared via a simple, one-step hydrothermal method, resulting in high-loading (16.2-21.0 mg/cm2) binder-free three-dimensional (3D) porous electrodes. In lithium-based batteries, an anionic S22--S2-redox system is demonstrated based on combined structural characterization using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and in situ synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy to elucidate the electrochemical behavior of the Mo and S centers. MoS2+x-GNP electrodes delivered 177 mAh/g (2.9 mAh/cm2) in the first cycle and 78 mAh/g (1.3 mAh/cm2) after 100 cycles at a current of 3.2 mA/cm2, representing high capacities despite such a high material loading for a sulfur-equivalent system, with 44% capacity retention and good rate capability. Conversely, the MoS2+x-CNT heterostructure displayed lower capacity and more capacity fade at all rates, attributed to aggregation of the active and carbonaceous materials in these electrodes and poor access to MoS2+xedge sites, as visualized via 3D Raman mapping and electron microscopy. The significantly improved capacity retention of the MoS2+x-GNP system is attributed to the (i) morphology because the arrangement of the 2D MoS2+xnanosheets on the GNP substrate allows for edge sites with excess sulfur to be exposed, (ii) increased stability of the structure during cycling, and (iii) homogeneous dispersion of the active and carbonaceous materials, resulting in good electrical contact.",ACS Applied Nano Materials
Au Nanoparticles Anchored on Sulfonated Carbon Nanotubes for Benzyl Alcohol Oxidation,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Promotion of gold (Au)-support synergy provides considerable opportunities to enhance the thermal stability of nanoscale gold catalysts. In this work, we developed an anchorage strategy for Au on sulfonated carbon nanotubes (CNTs), inspired by the mysterious Au-S synergy. S species existed mainly as sulfonyl groups with a tiny quantity of S atoms inserted in the carbon skeleton. The geometric and electronic structures of gold particles were modified, rendering them efficient for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Using integrated experimental and theoretical approaches, we explicitly show that Au particles of around 2.6 nm were highly dispersed at a S/C ratio of 1.4 at. %. Electrons were delivered from Au to the support with a maximized Au-C interfacial perimeter and promoted adsorption ability with the reactant. However, high S/C atomic ratios (≥3.9%) resulted in increased surface acidity and self-rearrangement of particles with abundant high-coordinated Au3+sites at the expense of conversion loss. Under appropriate sulfonation, Au/S1CNT exhibited a TOF value of 2294 h-1at only 50 °C. This work disentangled the structure manipulation of Au catalyst with a suitable action mode between Au and S species to afford a better Au catalyst with resistance to coarsening.",ACS Applied Nano Materials

Although their properties are theoretically confirmed, they are yet to be explored and confirmed experimentally. In this review article, we present advancements in research on borophene, its synthesis, and unique properties, including its advantages for various applications with theoretical predictions. The uniqueness of borophene over graphene and other 2-dimensional (2D) materials is also highlighted along with their various structural stabilities. The strategy for its theoretical simulations, leading to the experimental synthesis, could also be helpful for the exploration of many newer 2D materials.",RSC Advances

Recently, interest has been rekindled in this specific branch of chalcogenide materials, particularly in the opportune integration of indium-based TMSs with emerging materials such as MXenes, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), carbon quantum dots (CQDs), carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and metal-like Mo2C for various nanoscale heterojunction formations. In this mini review, recent outstanding advances of TMS-based heterostructures are concisely reviewed. Following an overview of the fundamental rationales of photocatalytic water splitting, a panorama of different indium-based TMSs (ZnIn2S4, CdIn2S4, and CaIn2S4) and their heterostructures (Z-scheme, conventional heterojunction, and Schottky junction) are outlined and discussed in terms of mechanistic insights and water splitting application prospects. On top of that, investigations of other burgeoning TMS-based heterostructures are carried out, followed by recommendations on future prospects of emerging TMS-based materials and the key challenges in practical water splitting. It is believed that this critical mini review is timely to bring new advances of TMS-based heterostructures and acts as a reference toward future endeavors in developing highly efficient and stable photocatalytic systems for H2 generation.",Energy and Fuels
High-Performance Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia under Ambient Conditions Using a FeOOH Nanorod Catalyst,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction is promising as an environmentally friendly process to produce high value-added ammonia with simultaneous removal of nitrate, a widespread nitrogen pollutant, for water treatment; however, efficient electrocatalysts with high selectivity are required for ammonia formation. In this work, FeOOH nanorod with intrinsic oxygen vacancy supported on carbon paper (FeOOH/CP) is proposed as a high-performance electrocatalyst for converting nitrate to ammonia at room temperature. When operated in a 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution with 0.1 M NaNO3, FeOOH/CP is able to obtain a large NH3 yield of 2419 μg h-1 cm-2 and a surprisingly high Faradic efficiency of 92% with excellent stability. Density functional theory calculation demonstrates that the potential-determining step for nitrate reduction over FeOOH (200) is *NO2H + H+ + e- → *NO + H2O.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
In Situ Constructing a Stable Solid Electrolyte Interface by Multifunctional Electrolyte Additive to Stabilize Lithium Metal Anodes for Li-S Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Lithium (Li) metal is considered to be the most promising anode due to the ultrahigh capacity and extremely low electrochemical potential. The tricky thing is that the growth of dendritic Li brings huge safety hazards to Li metal batteries. Herein, we demonstrate cerium nitrate as a multifunctional electrolyte additive to form a stable solid electrolyte interface on the metallic Li anode surface for durable Li-S batteries. The presence of Ce3+ helps to modulate the electroplating/stripping of Li and inhibits the growth of dendritic Li. An excellent cycle life exceeding 1400 h at the current density of 1 mA cm-2 can be realized in symmetric Li||Li cells. In addition, the in situ formed robust solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layer containing cerium sulfide on the Li anode surface conduces to weaken the reducibility of Li and regulate the electrochemical dissolution/deposition reaction on the Li anode. Surprisingly, by virtue of cerium nitrate additive with a low concentration of 0.03 M, the Li-S batteries can afford a capacity of 553 mA h g-1 at 5 C and a long cycle life at 1 C with a high capacity retention of 70.4%. Therefore, this study provides a novel idea to realize a uniform and dendrite-free Li anode for practical Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Unraveling the effect of disproportionation of lithium polysulfides on the electrochemical reaction and S utilization in lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLithium–sulfur batteries are considered to be high-energy-density batteries for next-generation energy storage systems instead of commercialized lithium-ion batteries. Even though the dissolution of lithium polysulfides in lithium–sulfur batteries and their consequent electrochemical performance degradation have been studied, the chemical reaction between dissolved lithium polysulfides and solid sulfur, which is called disproportionation, has been less emphasized. In this work, disproportionation during electrochemical discharge is identified in lithium-carbon cells with catholyte under practical conditions (the ratio of electrolyte to sulfur is sufficiently low ≈ 4 μL mgsulfur−1), and concentration changes by disproportionation are predicted. To quantify the disproportionation in real time, an electrochemical method, which is a constant current/constant voltage test, is proposed from which the chemical/electrochemical kinetic parameters are derived. This enables us to evaluate the equilibrium shifts of disproportionation at different compositions of lithium polysulfides and the consequent changes in charge amount. The suggested methods are further investigated at different applied currents to elucidate the correlation between the disproportionation and S utilization at different applied currents.",Electrochimica Acta
Facile Steam-Etching Approach to Increase the Active Site Density of an Ordered Porous Fe-N-C Catalyst to Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Developing facile and effective strategies to improve the active site density of transition-metal and nitrogen codoped carbon (M-N-C) catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains a challenge. Herein, we propose ordered templates and a steam-etching synergetic approach to increase the active site density of Fe-N-C catalysts with interconnected ordered porous structures. The steam etching corrodes inactive amorphous carbon while active sites are well preserved. X-ray absorption fine structure and fitting result reveal the uniform distribution of atomically dispersed Fe-N4active sites. The steam etching dramatically increases the active site density by 4.6 times, which is verified by the NO adsorption-reduction experiments. As a result, the ORR mass activity of the ordered macroporous Fe-N-C catalyst treated by steam etching at 800 °C (OM-Fe-N-C-steam-800) is 1.8 times higher than that of Ar-protected one. The proton-exchange membrane fuel cell employing the OM-Fe-N-C-steam-800 catalyst delivered an enhanced peak power density of 0.78 W cm-2compared to that of Ar-protected counterpart (0.63 W cm-2).",ACS Catalysis

However, the real challenge is to improve the selectivity of catalytic reactions to yield higher value products, which is to be discussed.",iScience
Three-dimensional loofah sponge derived amorphous carbon-graphene aerogel via one-pot synthesis for high-performance electrochemical sensor for hydrogen peroxide and dopamine,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, three-dimensional structured loofah sponge derived amorphous carbon-graphene aerogel (LSDC-GA) was firstly synthesized via one pot hydrothermal method. Graphene nanosheets are connected with each other to form a 3D porous structure, while LSDC nanosheets are randomly embedded between graphene layers without aggregation. Compared with GA and LSDC, LSDC-GA has the largest specific surface area of about 526.4 m2·g−1. The C and O elements of the hybrid LSDC-GA material are originating from reduced GO and LSDC, and the C/O atomic ratio was decreased in the order of LSDC > LSDC-GA > GA. LSDC-GA exhibits the smallest Rct value corresponding to 98.5 Ω, indicative of the excellent electrical conductivity. When applied in the electrochemical detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the so-formed LSDC-GA electrode shows enhanced sensing properties with high sensitivity, a linear electrochemical range from 12 μM to 2.69 mM, a low detection limit of 1.2 µM, and satisfied selectivity, stability and reproducibility as well. Furthermore, for electrochemical biosensor application of dopamine (DA) detection, the LSDC-GA material also exhibits a linear electrochemical range of 2.5 μM–560 μM and a low limit down to 0.25 μM. These improved sensing performances enable it as promising electrode material for extensive electrochemical sensing applications.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
A flexible micro direct methanol fuel cells array based on FPCB,"© 2022In recent years, flexible electronic technology has developed rapidly, of which flexible energy devices hold an important seat that determines the system's capacity. In this study, we demonstrate an integrated direct methanol fuel cells (µDMFCs) array in a flexible form factor. The device contains 12 individual cells that reside on a flexible printed circuit board to enable flexibility. Each cell was designed as an energy-supply electronic component. Buckle-type end plates were implemented to replace the traditional bolts-and-nuts end plates, reducing the dead weight and volume of the device while increasing its energy density. A Polydimethylsiloxane cover on the anode side was designed to encapsulate the µDMFCs array and act as a reservoir for the methanol solution. The open-circuit voltage of the µDMFCs array is configurable can reach up to 6 V with serial connections. In the configuration containing 2 groups of 6 cells in series, the device reached a maximum power density of 7.5 mW/cm2 in its original state and up to 10 mW/cm2 during bending. This novel and practical design of µDMFCs array can greatly promote the application of µDMFCs on flexible and wearable electronics.",Energy Conversion and Management
Bimetal single atom on defect-tailoring carbon nitride that boosts photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and superfast contaminant degradation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Bimetal single atom functionalized porous carbon nitride (K1Na1/pCN) is designed by one-step method of forming defective carbon nitride and anchoring single atom, which constructs an efficient transfer channel for charge carriers via selective tailoring and linking heptazine rings in frameworks. The existence of single atom over pCN substrate is proved by special aberration corrected transmission electron microscope, X-ray absorption near-edge structures and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The as-prepared K1Na1/pCN presents superior activity towards hydrogen evolution (4,561 μmol/h/gPt, AQY is 21.8% at 420 nm) and ciprofloxacin degradation (apparent kinetic constant of 0.74 min−1), which are almost one-order and two-order of magnitude larger than the traditional carbon nitride, respectively. Results of experimental data and density functional theory reveal that the K1Na1/pCN can narrow bandgap, form midgap state and provide more effective active sites, which have a synergistic effect on inhibiting charge carrier recombination and improving their directional transfer. This paper proposes an alternative strategy to synthesize carbon nitride-supported single atom by a one-step method and extends to support other metal single atoms via facile alternatives of molten salts.",Separation and Purification Technology
Porous metal oxide electrocatalytic nanomaterials for energy conversion: Oxygen defects and selection techniques,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Energy conversion technologies including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) remain cleaner and sustainable approaches to replace the finite fossil fuels and its consequences in a global world. Accelerating the conversion efficiencies of these systems requires the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts and the appropriate selection of electrolytes and conversion parameters. Porous metal oxides are a novel emergent class of electrocatalysts that are currently attracting wider attention for energy conversion applications. This study presents recent advancements in porous metal oxide (MO) electrocatalysts for different energy conversion technologies.

Hierarchically porous membranes with synergistic Co clusters and N active sites enabled High-Efficient Li-ion transporting and redox reaction activity in Li–S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Sluggish redox kinetics, shuttle effect, poor Li+ conductivity, and large volume change of sulfur limit the practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we propose the construction of a sandwich-structured interlayer with a membrane supporting layer and two-sided synergistic Co/N-codoped interfaces. The middle supporting layer with hierarchically porous frame and ultrahigh porosity of 90 % is constituted of carbon nanotubes (CNT) as core and N-doped carbon coating as the crosslinked shell, which can improve the conductivity of Li+ and electrons and provide enough space for polysulfide (LiPSs) anchoring and conversion. The two-sided synergistic Co/N-codoped interfaces including Co clusters and N active sites show strong adsorption of S/Li2Sx and exceptionally high catalytic activity. The theoretical calculation demonstrates that the LiPSs are preferentially adsorbed on Co clusters due to the stronger affinity, while the free N active sites can work as transition points for Li+ transfer during the LiPSs conversion and Li2S decomposition processes. In this way, the N active sites with transition capacity and Co clusters with high adsorption and catalytic ability exhibit high-efficient synergistic effect in mitigating the shuttle effect and reducing energy barrier of the redox reaction. Benefit from the hierarchically porous membrane and the two-sided synergistic Co clusters and N sites, high-efficient Li+/electron transport and catalytic activity are achieved simultaneously in Li-S batteries. The proposed strategy has important guiding significance for the design of novel multifunctional interlayers for high-performance Li-S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
A light-activated TiO2@In2Se3@Ag3PO4 cathode for high-performance Zn-Air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Zn-air batteries (ZABs) require a small discharging voltage and large charging voltage. In this work, mesoporous hollow nanospheres of titanium dioxide@indium selenide@silver phosphate (TiO2@In2Se3@Ag3PO4) are designed and synthesized. The three-layer structure consists of TiO2 as the inner layer, In2Se3 as the middle layer, and Ag3PO4 as the outer layer. When TiO2@In2Se3@Ag3PO4 is irradiated with light, In2Se3 serves as the sensitizer to enhance light absorption and in the three-layer architecture, the photogenerated electrons and holes migrate in opposite direction in the near surface to minimize recombination. Hence, the three monomeric materials produce synergistic effects upon light illumination. The excited electrons are mainly concentrated in the conduction band (CB) of In2Se3 to promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and also increase the output voltage during discharging. On the other hand, holes are primarily concentrated in the valence band (VB) of Ag3PO4 to promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and decrease the input voltage during charging. During light illumination, the discharging and charging voltages of the ZABs are 1.82 V and 0.64 V, respectively. The novel materials design reveals an effective strategy to harvest photo energy for electrochemical storage devices.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Rapid internal conversion harvested in Co/Mo dichalcogenides hollow nanocages of polysulfides for stable Lithium-Sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The sluggish conversion kinetics of the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates are hindering the practical application of lithium sulfur batteries (LSB) by their low efficiency and low cycle stability. To tackle these challenges, a rapid internal conversion (RIC) mechanism is proposed for the first time to accelerate the liquid–solid conversion in the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) kinetics. It is reaveled that the reaction energy barrier in the SRR lies in the liquid–solid conversion, from Li2S4 to LiS2* to Li2S2. To accelerate the liquid–solid conversion, the CoS2@MoS2 hollow nanocage, a novel sulfur cathode, with the rational synergistic active site configuration is specifically designed toward a well-managed reaction path and sulfurphilic structure to regulate and modulate Li(LiPS)-S(sulfide) and S(LiPS)-M(sulfide) bonds prominently, affecting on activating reactants and stablizing transition states. Based on the RIC mechanism in the SRR, the stronger S-Co bonds between CoS2 and LiPS traps Li2S4 and catalytically facilitates S-S bond scission while the MoS2 is conducive to the migration of Li2S4 by weaker Li-S bonds. The unique synergetic conversion and catalytic functions is confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The RIC mechanism could provide a new idea for exploring the conversion-catalysis material of Li-S batteries in the specific material design.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Flower-like CeO2-supported small-sized Ru nanoparticle hybrids for highly efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution: Roles of interfacial effects,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Ruthenium (Ru) is perceived as a promising electrocatalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its fast water dissociation ability, but its performance is mainly limited by the intense hydrogen bond strength. Herein, the unique three-dimensional Ru/CeO2 hybrids with interfacial effects were proposed to significantly enhance the alkaline HER performance of Ru. The combination of structural characterizations, electrochemical analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrates that Ru/CeO2 interfaces as real active sites play a crucial role. The strong surface interaction bewteen small-sized Ru nanoparticles and nanosheet-based flower-like CeO2 suppotrs not only greatly increases the actives sites but also optimizes the hydrogen binding and water absorption/dissociation energies. Subsequently, the optimal hybrid catalyst with low Ru loadings of only 3 wt% exhibits a relatively small overpotential of 28.9 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a low Tafel slope of 53.2 mV dec-1 as well as an excellent long-term durability in 1 M KOH.",Applied Surface Science
Catalytic polysulfides immobilization within a S/C-Co-N hollow cathode obtained by nonthermal imprison route,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have hitherto attracted dramatic research interests as an optional high-energy output candidate to replace the traditional lithium-ion batteries on account of its high energy density and low cost. Nonetheless, their kinetics arrearage and detrimental “shuttling effect” caused by the migration of soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates severely limit its practical application. Here, by a nonthermal route sulfur is in-situ imprisoned into Co/N-codoped hollow carbon sphere (NC-Co) to construct an integrated S/C-Co-N hollow cathode (S@NC-Co) and directly applied in Li-S batteries, which effectively avoids complex template removal and sulfur infiltration process. The hollow NC-Co sphere not only restricts polysulfides migration via physical confinement but also enhances polysulfides conversion through redox-active electro-catalysis. Moreover, the hollow structure has large cavity offering sufficient space to accommodate volume expansion and excellent conductivity promising efficient electron/charge transfer. As a result, the batteries assembled by the S@NC-Co cathode achieve low polarization and high-rate capability (551 mAh g−1 at 4C). Remarkably, the batteries also present an outstanding long-term durability over 800 cycles at 1C, in which the capacity attenuation is merely 0.06 % per cycle. This work demonstrates a novel strategy in designing hierarchical structures or nanoreactors for electrochemical reactions and energy storage systems.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Bioderived carbon fiber conductive networks with inlaid electrocatalysts as an ultralight freestanding interlayer for working Li–SeS2 pouch cells,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdIntroducing a freestanding functional interlayer has been a conventional tactic to immobilize the soluble polysulfide intermediate in Li–S batteries. However, most of the designed interlayers possess extra heavy weight, casting additional technical challenges toward practical high-specific-energy batteries. Herein, an ultralight self-standing interlayer with an extremely low mass loading (∼0.14 mg cm−2), composed of porous curly carbon fibers derived from natural biomass with inlaid cobalt electrocatalysts (CF–Co), was engineered via a convenient way. After replacing the poor conductivity sulfur (∼10−28 S m−1) by higher conductivity selenium disulfide (SeS2, ∼10−6 S m−1) as active cathode materials, the hierarchically porous-structured, conductive CF-Co interlayer with outstanding adsorptive and electrocatalytic effects is introduced into the resulted Li–SeS2 batteries to capture dual-intermediate polysulfides/polyselenides, boost their conversion kinetics, and ensure favorable running of Li–SeS2 cells with high SeS2 loading and lean electrolyte. Consequently, the coin cells deliver outstanding high-rate capability (404 mAh g−1 at 8 A g−1) and superior cycling stability (∼81.5% areal capacity retention in 125 cycles) under high SeS2 loading (5.0 mg cm−2). Significantly, practical high-areal-capacity (>5.5 mAh cm−2) Li–SeS2 pouch cells can be realized by assembling this interlayer with double-side SeS2-loading cathodes (132 mg), working stably at relatively lower electrolyte condition (6.0 μL mg−1).",Carbon
Boron and nitrogen co-doped vertical graphene electrodes for scalp electroencephalogram recording,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdGraphene has shown immense potential for applications in monitoring scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the radial head shape, high-resistance scalp cuticle, and hair prevent graphene from contacting skin, resulting in high contact impedances and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in EEG signals. Therefore, B and N co-doped vertical graphene (BNVG) electrodes are synthesized to improve the skin affinity and sweat adsorption capacity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that the series of BNVG electrodes comprise B-doping contents of 1.25–9.85 at% and N-doping contents of 1.12–6.48 at%. A systematic analysis of the effects of B and N atom contents on the real-time scalp-contact resistances, EEG correlation coefficients between BNVG and Ag/AgCl electrodes, and SNRs of the EEG signals are conducted. The BNVG electrode comprising 4.47 at% B and 3.18 at% N is determined as the optimum electrode for scalp EEG signal acquisition. Furthermore, an EEG cap assembled with 19 optimized BNVG electrodes records spontaneous and evoked EEG signals. The BNVG-based EEG cap used with sweat or aqueous NaCl solution is confirmed to be advantageous and can be applied to clinical and brain-computer interface systems.",Carbon
Fabrication of nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets anchored with carbon nanotubes for the degradation of tetracycline in saline water,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.The treatment of wastewater with high salinity is still a challenge because of the quenching effect of various anions on radical processes. The nonradical process may be a more promising pathway. Herein, a 3D structured nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheet anchored with carbon nanotubes (N-GS-CNTs) was prepared by direct pyrolysis of K3Fe(CN)6. The as-prepared catalyst can effectively activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for mineralization of tetracycline (TC) over a wide pH range (from 3 to 11) and even in high saline water (500 mM Cl−, HCO3−, etc.). The degradation mechanism was elucidated by both experimental characterizations and DFT calculations. The high catalytic efficiency was attributed to accelerated electron transfer from donor (TC) to acceptor (PMS) in the presence of the catalyst, which acts as electron shuttle mediators to promote a nonradical process. At the same time, the catalyst also enhances the production of singlet oxygen (1O2), hence further increasing the degradation rate. This study not only provides a simple method for synthesizing N-GS-CNT catalysts but also provides new insights into the electron transfer pathway for the removal of organic pollutants under high salinity conditions.",Environmental Research
Role of Ferroelectric In2Se3in Polysulfide Shuttling and Charging/Discharging Kinetics in Lithium/Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) and sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries, with the advantages of ultrahigh energy density, natural abundance, and ecofriendliness, are regarded as next-generation rechargeable batteries. However, polysulfide shuttling and sluggish charging/discharging kinetics in sulfur cathodes severely hamper their practical applications. In this study, via employing first-principles calculations, we investigate two-dimensional ferroelectric In2Se3as a promising additive to overcome these obstacles. Our studies reveal the following findings: (1) the In2Se3monolayer has a modest adsorption strength to soluble polysulfides, which not only eliminates the notorious shuttle effect but also prevents polysulfide dissolution; (2) In2Se3is able to significantly reduce the free energy barriers of sulfur reduction reaction and the decomposition barriers of Li2S and Na2S, thus greatly enhancing the charging and discharging efficiency; and (3) due to the strong binding ability, the polarization downward (P↓) surface always outperforms the polarization upward (P↑) surface during charging/discharging processes, enabling the effective control of battery performance by ferroelectric switching. Given these advantages, it is expected that ferroelectric In2Se3and similar ferroelectric additives will open a new route to enhance Li-S and Na-S battery performance.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Synergistic Effect between Monodisperse Fe3O4Nanoparticles and Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanosheets to Promote Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Effective fabrication of electrocatalysts active in anchoring and converting lithium polysulfides is critical for the manufacturing of high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). In this study, original Fe3O4nanospheres with diameters close to 12 nm were finely dispersed over a porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrix by the freeze-drying method to produce a three-dimensional composite material (nano-Fe3O4/PNC) suitable for application as a sulfur host in LSBs. Nano-Fe3O4/PNC loaded with sulfur (S@nano-Fe3O4/PNC) was used as a cathode in a Li-S cell, whose initial discharge specific capacity reached 1256 mA h g-1at a 0.1 C rate. After 100 charge-discharge cycles at a 0.2 C rate, the reversible capacity of S@nano-Fe3O4/PNC remained at 745 mA h g-1, demonstrating a capacity retention rate of 70%. Importantly, a high Coulombic efficiency of more than 99% was achieved, indicating effective inhibition of the polysulfides' ""shuttle effect"" by nano-Fe3O4/PNC. The use of electrolytes containing lithium nitrate further reduces the ""shuttle effect"" of polysulfides. This study demonstrates the synergistic effect between metal oxide nanoparticles and N-doped carbon, which plays an important role in promoting the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides in LSBs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
"MoP Quantum Dot-Modified N,P-Carbon Nanotubes as a Multifunctional Separator Coating for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries","© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have the advantages of high energy density and low cost and are considered promising next-generation energy storage systems, but the shuttle effect and slow sulfur redox kinetics severely limit their practical applications. Herein, MoP quantum dot-modified N,P-doped hollow PPy substrates are adopted as separator modification coatings for LSBs. The MoP quantum dots exhibit excellent chemisorption and catalytic conversion capabilities for polysulfides, while the N,P-doped PPy substrates can provide flexible channels for Li+/electron transport and act as a physical barrier to suppress the shuttle effect. As a result, LSBs assembled with modified separators exhibit excellent rate capability (739 mAh/g at 3 C) and cycle performance (600 mAh/g at 1 C after 600 cycles, 0.052% decay per cycle). Moreover, even under a high sulfur loading of 3.68 mg/cm2, areal capacities of 3.58 and 2.92 mAh/cm2for the 1st cycle and 110th cycle are achieved. In addition, according to density functional theory calculations, MoP quantum dots have large adsorption energy for S8and Li2Sn, which further confirms the possibility of lowering the initial nucleation energy barrier of Li2S and helps to improve the kinetics of the subsequent Li2S reaction. This study proposes a novel method for using transition-metal phosphides as catalysts in high-performance LSBs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Streamline Sulfur Redox Reactions to Achieve Efficient Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.It is vital to dynamically regulate S activity to achieve efficient and stable room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT/Na−S) batteries. Herein, we report using cobalt sulfide as an electron reservoir to enhance the activity of sulfur cathodes, and simultaneously combining with cobalt single atoms as double-end binding sites for a stable S conversion process. The rationally constructed CoS2 electron reservoir enables the straight reduction of S to short-chain sodium polysulfides (Na2S4) via a streamlined redox path through electron transfer. Meanwhile, cobalt single atoms synergistically work with the electron reservoir to reinforce the streamlined redox path, which immobilize in situ formed long-chain products and catalyze their conversion, thus realizing high S utilization and sustainable cycling stability. The as-developed sulfur cathodes exhibit a superior rate performance of 443 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 with a high cycling capacity retention of 80 % after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition

Therefore, exploring a new technique to construct catalyst require minimal amounts of Pt and maintain high performance is very necessary. Herein, we first designed a high-efficiency electrocatalyst based ultralow Pt loading (1.27 μg cm‒2) on two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXene support by controlling Cu monolayer underpotential deposition (UPD), and then galvanic replacement Cu monolayer with Pt. Due to the energetically favorable metal-support interaction, in acidic media the as-prepared Pt-Ti3C2Tx MXene catalyst achieved a current density of 10 mA cm‒2 at low overpotential of 30 mV. Furthermore, the Pt-Ti3C2Tx MXene catalyst also exhibited a superior HER activity with high turnover frequency (TOF) of 41.8 s‒1 and mass activity of 41.3 A mgPt–1, which were about nearly 47 times those of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst, respectively. This work demonstrate the potential of Ti3C2Tx MXene as support for design of ultralow Pt loading electrocatalyst through Cu UPD-Galvanic replacement method that can be used for a wide range of catalytic reaction.",Electrochimica Acta
NiCo-Se nanoparticles encapsulated N-doped CNTs derived from prussian blue analogues for high performance supercapacitors,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHerein, N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) encapsulating NiCo-Se nanoparticles (NPs) are assembled to spheres (NCNTs/NiCo-Se), which are successfully synthesized by using Ni-Co prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as templates and precursors. It is rare to derive CNTs from PBAs by means of C3H6 among the reported work and the structure evolution of NCNTs spheres derived from PBAs is exhibited. The high flow rate of N2 and C3H6 tend to cause short CNTs and large diameter of CNTs, respectively, owing to the dual-effect of diffusion and deposition of C atoms. Due to the advantage superposition of CNTs with high length-diameter ratio and NiCo-Se NPs, NCNTs/NiCo-Se gets excellent capabilities of charge transfer, diffusion efficiency, and electrochemical reactions. When the C3H6/N2 is 0.2/0.3 L min−1, the as-fabricated NCNTs/NiCo-Se deliver a substantially appreciable specific capacitance of 171.1 mAh g−1 (current density of 1 A g−1). The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) yields a maximum energy density of 55 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 801 W kg−1. In general, this work offers an attractive route to synthesize CNTs composites from PBAs.",Electrochimica Acta

However, the design and development of electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity is currently a major challenge. In this work, we successfully constructed RuFe bimetallic nanoparticles on a two-dimensional MXene support (RuFe@MXene) through a simple liquid phase reduction method. Benefiting from the rich surface chemistry and high electronic conductivity of MXene, as well as the synergistic effect between RuFe bimetals, the composite can efficiently synthesize ammonia under environmental conditions. Specifically, the NH3 yield and Faraday efficiency of the prepared Ru0.3Fe0.7@MXene composite catalyst reaches 40.79 μg h−1 cm−2 and 15.25 % at −0.4 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH, which are significantly higher than that of the previously reported Ru@MXene. Moreover, the Ru0.3Fe0.7@MXene catalyst also exhibits outstanding electrochemical stability. The density of state (DOS) and the partial density of state (PDOS) of MXene, Fe@MXene, Ru@MXene, and RuFe@MXene were calculated by DFT to explore the synergistic effect of RuFe on the nitrogen reduction performance of MXene-based catalysts.

Diaryliodonium Tetracyanidometallates Self-Assemble into Halogen-Bonded Square-Like Arrays,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Two diphenyliodonium tetracyanidometallates, [Ph2I]2[M(CN)4] (M = Ni and Pd), were prepared through anion metathesis. Their X-ray structural analyses show that the structure-defining contact for both crystals is the charge-assisted I···N halogen bond (HaB) formed between the I atom of the iodonium cations and the N atoms of the CN-ligands. These HaBs assemble the bidentate and 90°-orienting HaB donor Ph2I+and the tetradentate, square planar, and 90/180°-orienting HaB acceptors [M(CN)4]2-into supramolecular rectangles, which further assemble into infinite chains by sharing the vertexes occupied by the [M(CN)4]2-anions. The noncovalent nature of these contacts was confirmed by density functional theory calculations (M06/def2-TZVP) followed by combined topological analysis of the electron density distribution in the quantum theory of the atoms-in-molecules approach and noncovalent interaction analysis. The philicities of the HaB partners were further verified by the analysis of electron localization function projections, electron density/electrostatic potential profiles along the I···N bond paths, natural bond orbital analysis, and the natural population analysis or atoms-in-molecules charge sums in model systems.",Crystal Growth and Design
An analysis of Schottky barrier in silicene/Ga2SeS heterostructures by employing electric field and strain,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryTwo-dimensional materials are leading the way in nanodevice applications thanks to their various advantages. Although two-dimensional materials show promise for many applications, they have certain limitations. In the last decade, the increasing demand for the applications of novel two-dimensional materials has accelerated heterostructure studies in this field. Hence, restoring the combination of two-dimensional heterostructured materials has been reported. In this paper, we show that the effect of the external electric field and biaxial strain on the silicene/Ga2SeS heterostructure has a critical impact on the tuning of the Schottky barrier height. The findings such as the variation of the electronic band gap, interlayer charge transfer, total dipole moment, and n-type/p-type Schottky barrier transitions of the silicene/Ga2SeS heterostructure under external effects imply that the device performance can be adjusted with Janus 2D materials.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Adsorption of Li(I) Ions through New High-Performance Electrospun PAN/Kaolin Nanofibers: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Calculation,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium (Li), as a strategic energy source in the 21st century, has a wide range of application prospects. As the demand for lithium resources grows, refining lithium resources becomes increasingly important. A novel method was proposed to directly prepare polyacrylonitrile-LiCl·2Al(OH)3·nH2O (PAN-Li/Al-LDH) composites from kaolin with simple operation and low cost, showing effective adsorption performance for the removal of Li(I) from brine in a salt lake. Moreover, several techniques have been applied for characterization, including X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption behaviors of PAN-Li/Al-LDHs for Li(I) in salt-lake brines, indicating that the adsorption equilibrium could reach within 2 h, and the adsorption kinetics for Li(I) conforms to the pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption isotherms are consistent with those obtained by the Langmuir model, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 5.2 mg/g. The competitive experimental results indicated that PAN-Li/Al-LDHs exhibited specific selectivity for Li(I) in the mixed solutions of Mg(II), Na(I), K(I), and Ca(II) with the selectivity coefficients of 9.57, 19.38, 43.40, and 33.05, respectively. Moreover, the PAN-Li/Al-LDHs could be reused 60 times with basically unchanged adsorption capacity, showing excellent stability and regeneration ability. Therefore, PAN-Li/Al-LDHs would have promising industrial application potential for the adsorption and recovery of Li(I) from salt-lake brines.",ACS Omega

All rights reserved.In recent years, the exploration of the nanozyme, an artificial enzyme with the structure and function of natural enzymes, has become a hot topic in this field. Although significant progress has been made, it is still a huge challenge to design nanozymes with multiple enzyme-like catalytic activities. In this work, we have successfully fabricated a colorimetric sensing platform to mimic peroxidase-like and oxidase-like activities by the CoS1.035nanoparticles decorated N-doped carbon framework porous dodecahedrons (abbreviated to CoS1.035/N-C PDHs). And the catalytic mechanism of CoS1.035/N-C PDHs toward the peroxidase-like and oxidase-like activities is systematically explored. The results display that CoS1.035/N-C PDHs can catalyze the oxidation of the colorless substrate 3,3,′5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) into blue oxidized TMB (ox-TMB) by disintegrating H2O2or the physically/chemically absorbed O2into different ROS species (·OH or O2·-) in the presence or absence of H2O2. Therefore, on the basis of the dual-enzyme mimic activities of CoS1.035/N-C PDHs, the bifunctional colorimetric sensing platform is established for H2O2detection with a wide linear range of 0.5-120 μM and glutathione detection with a linear range of 1-60 μM, respectively.

Here, nitrogen and oxygen co-doped hierarchical porous carbon materials (NOPCs) are facilely prepared by the one-step carbonization of PEG-200/melamine/MgO bulks within ten minutes. The solid bulks enable the synthesis more conveniently, and make the NOPCs have a uniform structure and high electrochemical performance. The optimized products, NOPC-900, has the largest specific surface area (the SBET of 1248 m2 g−1), abundant mesopore structures (average pore diameter of 9.40 nm), with thin carbon walls (3–10 graphene layers), and the effective heteroatom doping (the content of N atom is 2.67 at.%, and O atom is 12.49 at.%).

Effect of zinc-based active sites on porous carbon and electrochemical properties in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) is considered as one of the promising cathodes of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) owing to its appealing merits. However, it is still preventing the shuttle effect poorly due to the weak interaction between nonpolar carbon and polar polysulfide (LiPS). Herein, we report a facile method to prepare polar hierarchically porous carbon by in-situ loading the different amounts of zinc-based active sites (p-HPC-X) onto the HPC materials. The close combination of a carbon interconnected skeleton and ZnS nanoparticles derived zinc-based active sites forms the strong interaction that suppresses the soluble polysulfide shuttle effect and catalyzes the kinetics redox reactions of lithium polysulfide/sulfide. Moreover, the effect of polar sites introduced in situ on the morphology/porosity of carbon materials is also focused on. Crystallization of zinc-based active sites during the freeze-drying process and self-assembly during carbonization allow the pore size distribution of porous carbon to be customized, which offers fast lithium-ion and electron transport channels. Due to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical pore structure and suitable polarity sites, the p-HPC-X exhibits high capacity and good cycling performance. Especially p-HPC-1, it yields a high reversible capacity of 683.7 mAh g−1 and a low fading rate of 0.041% per cycle over 900 cycles at a current density of 1 C.

"Low temperature lithium-ion batteries electrolytes: Rational design, advancements, and future perspectives","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are considered as irreplaceable energy storage technologies in modern society. However, the LIBs encounter a sharp decline in discharge capacity and discharge voltage in low temperature environment (< 0 °C), which cannot meet growing demands for portable electronics and electric vehicles at low temperature. In particular, the LIBs experience the dramatical decrease of lithium-ion conductivity in electrolyte and sluggish charge transfer process within the electrode at low temperature. Therefore, rational design on the low-temperature electrolyte is critical important for achieving excellent performance of LIBs to broaden their application scenarios at low-temperature. To this end, in this review, we firstly discuss the origination on the LIBs performance degradation at low temperature. Then, the corresponding strategies on rational tailoring traditional electrolytes (lithium salts and the solvents, including carbonate-based, carboxylate-based, ether-based and ionic liquid solvent), and the new emerging electrolytes (e.g., locally high concentrated electrolyte, liquefied gas electrolyte and polymer electrolyte) towards low-temperature LIBs are introduced. Finally, the remaining challenges and future perspectives for low-temperature LIBs are presented. It is expected that this review will shed fresh light on electrolyte design for low-temperature LIBs and accelerate widespread application of LIBs for low temperature environment.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Hollow multi-shelled Co3O4 as nanoreactors to activate peroxymonosulfate for highly effective degradation of Carbamazepine: A novel strategy to reduce nano-catalyst agglomeration,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Reducing the agglomeration of nano-catalysts to retain the active catalytic sites is crucial for the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) of peroxymonosulfate activation in wastewater treatments. Herein, Co3O4 hollow multi-shelled structures (HoMSs) were successfully prepared as the nanoreactors to reduce the agglomeration of nano-catalysts in catalytic reaction. Compared with single-shelled and double-shelled Co3O4 HoMSs, triple-shelled Co3O4 HoMSs (TS-Co3O4) exhibited best catalytic performance and the carbamazepine (5 mg L−1) degradation reached 100% within 30 min. The hollow multi-shelled structures showed a significant role in reducing the agglomeration of catalysts. The value of hydrodynamic diameter/true particle size of TS-Co3O4 was 1.58, which meant TS-Co3O4 could be regarded as a single dispersion or two together in aqueous solution. The shells of TS-Co3O4 supported each other and outer shells could protect the inner ones, hence the stability increased. Besides, the hollow cavity between shells reduced the mass diffusion resistance and increased the contact of reactants with active sites. Mechanism studies showed sulfate radicals (SO4•–) played a leading role in the degradation of carbamazepine. This work provided an effective way to reduce the agglomeration and retain the active sites of cobalt-based catalysts in AOPs, so as to balance the conflict between the reactivity and stability of nano-catalysts.",Journal of Hazardous Materials

Herein, we report a conductive two-dimensional π-d conjugated Ni and Co bimetal organic framework (MOF) - NiCo-(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene) (NiCo-HITP) nanorods decorated with highly dispersed Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) as a promising bi-functional electrocatalyst towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through an effective and facile strategy by modifying the rod-shaped -Ni3HITP2 crystals using cobalt ions. The triggered electrocatalytic activity of the resulting MOF-based materials was achieved by increasing the electrical conductivity (7.23 S cm-1) originated from Ni3HITP2 substrate and also by creating the cooperative catalysis sites of Co-N x and Co3O4 NPs. Optimized syntheses show a promising ORR activity with a high half-wave potential (0.77 V) and also a significantly improved OER activity compared with pure Ni3HITP2 in alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, a rechargeable Zn-air battery using the as-prepared material as air-cathode also shows a high power density (143.1 mW cm-2) - even comparable to a commercial Pt/C-RuO2-based battery.

First-Principles Study of Y-Doped WS2 Two-Dimensional Materials Y掺杂WS2二维材料的第一性原理研究,"© 2022, Journal of Synthetic Crystals Press. All right reserved.WS2 has attracted extensive attention due to its excellent physical and photoelectric properties. Based on the first-principle calculation method, electronic structure and optical properties of the intrinsic monolayer WS2 and the Y doped WS2 with different concentration of Y atoms substitutionally doped in W atom-site were investigated. The results show that the intrinsic monolayer WS2 is a direct band gap semiconductor with 1.814 eV of band gap. After 4% concentration (atomic fraction) of Y doping, the band gap reduces to 1.508 eV, and the direct band gap characteristics are still maintained. As the doping concentration increases, the band gap of the doped WS2 further decreases. When the concentration reaches 25%, the band structure transforms into indirect with the band gap of 0.658 eV, and the doped WS2 exhibits magnetic properties. Appropriate concentration of doping can improve the conductivity of materials. As the doping concentration increases, the doped system maintains transparency, and the absorption efficiency in infrared and visible region together with the dielectric properties of the material significantly improve. This work provides a theoretical basis for the research of two-dimensional WS2 related optoelectronic devices.",Rengong Jingti Xuebao/Journal of Synthetic Crystals

Recent Progress of Single⁃Atom Catalytic Materials for Lithium⁃Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022, Science Press (China). All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur （Li-S） batteries are one of the promising next-generation energy storage technologies due to their high theoretical specific capacity and energy density. However，in practical applications，low conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide，dissolution of polysulfides（LIPSs），and poor conversion of LIPSs to Li2 S2 /Li2 S result in the short lifespan and low rate performance of Li-S batteries. Recent studies show that single-atoms（SAs）with superior catalytic activities are ideal anchoring centers and catalytic sites for LIPSs. Modification of cathodes and separators with SAs helps to adsorb polysulfide，improve reaction kinetics and inhibit the shuttle effect. In addition，introduction of SAs into the anode can significantly improve the reversibility of Li deposition/stripping and inhibit the growth of dendrites. In this paper，we review the research progress of SAs in lithium-sulfur batteries，including material synthesis，characterization methods， application direction and catalytic mechanism. Finally，the key challenges and future developmental trends of SAs are summarized and discussed.",Chinese Journal of Applied Chemistry
2D Cu2-xSe@graphene multifunctional interlayer boosting polysulfide rapid conversion and uniform Li2S nucleation for high performance Li-S batteries,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Some vital challenges are main obstacles for further development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries such as low capacity and poor cycle stability resulted from polysulfide shuttling behavior, the physical/chemical entrapment is regarded as an effective method to inhibit and catalyze polysulfides. Herein we design a cross-linked framework of reduced graphene oxide anchored with Cu2-x Se nanoparticles (Cu2-x Se@rGO) by building an electrolyte/Cu2-x Se/graphene triple-phase interface to be a high-efficiency electrocatalyst for Li-S batteries. Importantly, this three-dimensional conductive network possesses a large specific surface area with high ion transport capability, meanwhile providing strong physical constraint for efficient adsorption of soluble polysulfides. Further, this triple-phase catalytic interface provides strong chemical adsorption and abundant Cu2-x Se nanoparticle sulfiphilic active sites, effectively inhibiting the dissolution of polysulfides and guaranteeing the efficient polysulfide adsorption catalysis as well as rapidly uniform Li2S nucleation. Consequently, with the Cu2-x Se@rGO separator, a lower capacity decay rate about 0.059% per cycle after 500 cycles at 2 C is obtained. What's more, with a higher areal sulfur loading of 3.0 mg cm-2, the capacity is still maintained at 805 mAh g-1 over 100 cycles. Therefore, this work will open new avenue to construct 2D transition metal selenide for superior performance Li-S batteries.",2D Materials

Engineering Sodium Metal Anode with Sodiophilic Bismuthide Penetration for Dendrite-Free and High-Rate Sodium-Ion Battery,"© 2022 THE AUTHORSSodium (Na) metal batteries with a high volumetric energy density that can be operated at high rates are highly desirable. However, an uneven Na-ion migration in bulk Na anodes leads to localized deposition/dissolution of sodium during high-rate plating/stripping behaviors, followed by severe dendrite growth and loose stacking. Herein, we engineer the Na hybrid anode with sodiophilic Na3Bi-penetration to develop the abundant phase-boundary ionic transport channels. Compared to intrinsic Na, the reduced adsorption energy and ion-diffusion barrier on Na3Bi ensure even Na+ nucleation and rapid Na+ migration within the hybrid electrode, leading to uniform deposition and dissolution at high current densities. Furthermore, the bismuthide enables compact Na deposition within the sodiophilic framework during cycling, thus favoring a high volumetric capacity. Consequently, the obtained anode was endowed with a high current density (up to 5 mA∙cm−2), high areal capacity (up to 5 mA∙h∙cm−2), and long-term cycling stability (up to 2800 h at 2 mA∙cm−2).",Engineering

Electrochemical Performance of Carbon-Rich Silicon Carbonitride Ceramic as Support for Sulfur Cathode in Lithium Sulfur Battery,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.As a promising matrix material for anchoring sulfur in the cathode for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, porous conducting supports have gained much attention. In this work, sulfur-containing C-rich SiCN composites are processed from silicon carbonitride (SiCN) ceramics, synthesized at temperatures from 800 to 1100◦ C. To embed sulfur in the porous SiCN matrix, an easy and scalable procedure, denoted as melting-diffusion method, is applied. Accordingly, sulfur is infiltrated under solvothermal conditions at 155◦ C into pores of carbon-rich silicon carbonitride (C-rich SiCN). The impact of the initial porosity and microstructure of the SiCN ceramics on the electrochemical performance of the synthesized SiCN-sulfur (SiCN-S) composites is analysed and discussed. A combination of the mesoporous character of SiCN and presence of a disordered free carbon phase makes the electrochemical performance of the SiCN matrix obtained at 900◦ C superior to that of SiCN synthesized at lower and higher temperatures. A capacity value of more than 195 mAh/g over 50 cycles at a high sulfur content of 66 wt.% is achieved.",Nanomaterials
A Highly Efficient Sulfur Host Enabled by Nitrogen/Oxygen Dual-Doped Honeycomb-Like Carbon for Advanced Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.High energy density and long cycle life of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries suffer from the shuttle/expansion effect. Sufficient sulfur storage space, local fixation of polysulfides, and outstanding electrical conductivity are crucial for a robust cathode host. Herein, a modified template method is proposed to synthesize a highly regular and uniform nitrogen/oxygen dual-doped honeycomb-like carbon as sulfur host (N/O-HC-S). The unique structure not only offers physical entrapment for polysulfides (LiPSs) but also provides chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion sites of polysulfides. In addition, this structure offers enough space for loading sulfur, and a regular space of nanometer size can effectively prevent sulfur particles from accumulating. As expected, the as-prepared N/O-HC900-S with high areal sulfur loading (7.4 mg cm−2) shows a high areal specific capacity of 7.35 mAh cm−2 at 0.2 C. Theoretical calculations also reveal that the strong chemical immobilization and catalytic conversion of LiPSs attributed to the spin density and charge distribution of carbon atoms will be influenced by the neighbor nitrogen/oxygen dopants. This structure that provides cooperative chemical adsorption, high lithium ions flux, and catalytic conversion for LiPSs can offer a new strategy for constructing a polysulfide confinement structure to achieve robust Li–S batteries.",Small
Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid nanomaterials for diagnosis and treatment of cancer,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Incessant rising in morbidity and mortality rates in humans due to various types of cancers requires effective treatments and early-stage diagnosis. The chemotherapy is typically unable to cure tumors or improve survival rates due to its adverse effects on normal cells. Moreover, existing technologies are less sensitive and ineffective in detecting the early stage of tumor malignancy, which is also one of the main reasons for disease progression. In this context, quantitative and qualitative analysis of cancer is essential for both early detection and treatment. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials (NMs) are a potential candidate for the treatment and detection of cancer because of their distinctive physicochemical properties, including high surface area, easily functionalized surface, high photo-thermal ability high ion mobility, tunable release behaviors, and high biocompatibility. The combined effects of targeted drug delivery, photothermal/photodynamic therapy, imaging, and 2D-NMs chemotherapy have great possibilities in treating and diagnosing cancer. Herein, we discuss the synthesis of 2D-NMs using top-down (which includes mechanical, liquid, chemical oxidation, and electrochemical exfoliation) and (2) bottom-up (involves CVD and wet chemical synthesis process) approach. The biocompatibility of the 2D-NMs, anti-cancer applications which involves their role as biosensors (electrochemical, fluorescent), drug and gene delivery, and photothermal agents. Biocompatibility and possible practical solutions for cancer diagnosis as well as cures are also discussed. Therefore, this review article provides a newer insight of real time cancer diagnostic and treatment (limitation and challenges) using 2D-NMs.",Journal of Drug Delivery Science and Technology
Cobalt Phosphotungstate-Based Composites as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reactions,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are key reactions in energy-converting systems, such as fuel cells (FCs) and water-splitting (WS) devices. However, the current use of expensive Pt-based electrocatalysts for ORR and IrO2 and RuO2 for OER is still a major drawback for the economic viability of these clean energy technologies. Thus, there is an incessant search for low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts (ECs). Hence, herein, we report the preparation, characterization (Raman, XPS, and SEM), and application of four composites based on doped-carbon materials (CM) and cobalt phosphotungstate (MWCNT_N8_Co4, GF_N8_Co4, GF_ND8_Co4, and GF_NS8_Co4) as ORR and OER electrocatalysts in alkaline medium (pH = 13). Structural characterization confirmed the successful carbon materials doping with N and/or N, S, and the incorporation of the cobalt phosphotungstate. Overall, all composites showed good ORR performance with onset potentials ranging from 0.83 to 0.85 V vs. RHE, excellent tolerance to methanol crossover with current retentions between 88 and 90%, and good stability after 20,000 s at E = 0.55 V vs. RHE (73% to 82% of initial current). In addition, the number of electrons transferred per O2 molecule was close to four, suggesting selectivity to the direct process. Moreover, these composites also presented excellent OER performance with GF_N8_Co4 showing an overpotential of 0.34 V vs. RHE (for j = 10 mA cm−2) and jmax close to 70 mA cm−2. More importantly, this electrocatalyst outperformed state-of-the-art IrO2 electrocatalyst. Thus, this work represents a step forward toward bifunctional electrocatalysts using less expensive materials.",Catalysts
Insights into the growth of hexagonal Si crystals using Al-based nano absorber,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Although hexagonal (2H) silicon (Si) semiconductors exhibit excellent optical properties owing to their quasi-direct bandgap, their growth conditions, which require extremely high pressures, preclude their widespread use in industrial applications. The current study, therefore, proposes a novel approach for the facile growth of hexagonal Si at atmospheric pressure via a unique phenomenon known as Al-based nano absorber. A mixed-source hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) method was used for the growth of the hexagonal Si single crystals employing a rapid interaction between GaCl3, AlCl, and SiCln gases at a high temperature of 1200 °C using a source mixture of Ga, Al, and Si. In this process, the Al-based nano absorber was formed, which resulted in the absorbance of Si atoms, rather than the growth of Al-based nano absorber, to form the Si crystals due to the subsequent lack of GaCl3 and AlCl sources. The hexagonal Si structure of these Si crystals was confirmed using field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Thus, the current study establishes atmospheric pressure mixed-source HVPE as a facile approach for growing various allotropic crystals such as Si, C, or Ge via absorption of other atoms by an Al-based nano absorber.",Semiconductor Science and Technology
High electrochemical activity of Li2S2 linking two-dimensional tungsten boride nanosheet enables high-loading and long-lasting lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe Li2S-based cathodes with a high theoretical capacity of 1,166 mAh/g are regarded as the commercially available lithium-sulfur battery that can be coupled with Li-free anodes to avoid the safety concern of lithium metal. However, the instinct Li2S passivation leads to a high activation potential and low sulfur utilization with the notorious polysulfide migration. Herein, the single-atom tailoring strategy in designing liquid Li2S2 catholyte is created without the use of any complicated manufacturing processes or additives, where the Li2S2 cell enables the 3.0 V activation voltage without potential barrier. Meanwhile, the conductive and polar tungsten boride offer the active center to anchor polysulfides migration. As expected, the tungsten boride-Li2S2 cathode exhibits excellent cycling stability, impressive cycling performance without initial potential barrier.",Materials Today Energy
Transferring Liquid Metal to form a Hybrid Solid Electrolyte via a Wettability-Tuning Technology for Lithium-Metal Anodes,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Integrating solid-state electrolyte (SSE) into Li-metal anodes has demonstrated great promise to unleash the high energy density of rechargeable Li-metal batteries. However, fabricating a highly cyclable SSE/Li-metal anode remains a major challenge because the densification of the SSE is usually incompatible with the reactive Li metal. Here, a liquid-metal-derived hybrid solid electrolyte (HSE) is proposed, and a facile transfer technology to construct an artificial HSE on the Li metal is reported. By tuning the wettability of the transfer substrates, electron- and ion-conductive liquid metal is sandwiched between electron-insulating and ion-conductive LiF and oxides to form the HSE. The transfer technology renders the HSE continuous, dense, and uniform. The HSE, having high ion transport, electron shut-off, and mechanical strength, makes the composite anode deliver excellent cyclability for over 4000 h at 0.5 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2 in a symmetrical cell. When pairing with LiFePO4 and sulfur cathodes, the HSE-coated Li metal dramatically enhances the performance of full cells. Therefore, this work demonstrates that tuning the interfacial wetting properties provides an alternate approach to build a robust solid electrolyte, which enables highly efficient Li-metal anodes.",Advanced Materials
Active site construction to boost electrochemical property for Li–S batteries: a review,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, as a research hotspot, are expected to address the need for energy storage systems with high energy density. However, the slow reaction kinetics of polysulfides due to the loss of electrical contact of soluble polysulfides and further shuttle effect hinder the further progression of Li–S batteries. This paper reviews the recent efficient approach to remedy the above issues: active site construction in the electrode materials or separators. The active site construction includes the increasing surface area, inducing molecular and single-atom catalysts, inducing heteroatomic doping, vacancies, or functional group. The high specific surface area can provide more sites for loading sulfur and also the more active sites for adsorption. Many porous materials are designed to provide more transfer paths for ions. Molecular and single-atom catalysts use some catalysts such as Fe–N–C or single metal atoms in various matrixes, representing the high catalytic activity. Defects can improve the electronic conductivity to quicken lithium ions diffusion in electrode materials, but also render more active sites to enhance catalytic activity and adsorption of electrode materials, accelerating the conversion of long-chain polysulfides to the next short-chain polysulfides and final products Li2S2/Li2S. The common active site construction and characterization methods of diversiform materials, for example, carbon materials, metal oxides, metal sulfides, and some other metal-free materials, are reviewed in this paper.",Journal of Materials Science
Manipulating Electrocatalytic Polysulfide Redox Kinetics by 1D Core–Shell Like Composite for Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Although lithium–sulfur batteries have high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg−1, the sluggish redox kinetics of soluble liquid polysulfide intermediates during discharge and charge is one of the main reasons for their limited battery performance. Designing highly efficient electrocatalysts with a core–shell like structure for accelerating polysulfide conversion is vital for the development of Li–S batteries. Herein, core–shell MoSe2@C nanorods are proposed to manipulate electrocatalytic polysulfide redox kinetics, thereby improving the Li–S battery performance. The 1D MoSe2@C is synthesized via a facile hydrothermal and subsequent selenization reaction. The electrocatalysis of MoSe2 is confirmed by the analysis of symmetric batteries, Tafel curves, changes of activation energy, and lithium-ion diffusion. Density functional theory calculations also prove the low Gibbs free energy of the reaction pathway and the lithium-ion diffusion barrier. Therefore, the Li–S batteries using MoSe2 electrocatalyst exhibit an excellent rate performance of 560 mAh g−1 at 1 C with a high sulfur loading of 3.4 mg cm−2 and an areal capacity of 4.7 mAh cm−2 at a high sulfur loading of 4.7 mg cm−2 under lean electrolyte conditions. This work provides a deeper insight into regulation of polysulfide redox kinetics in electrocatalysts for Li–S batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials

Phase-Reconfiguration-Induced NiS/NiFe2O4 Composite for Performance-Enhanced Zinc−Air Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Constructing composite structures is an essential approach for obtaining multiple functionalities in a single entity. Available synthesis methods of the composites need to be urgently exploited; especially in situ construction. Here, a NiS/NiFe2O4 composite through a local metal−S coordination at the interface is reported, which is derived from phase reconstruction in the highly defective matrix. X-ray absorption fine structure confirms that long-range order is broken via the local metal−S coordination and, by using electron energy loss spectroscopy, the introduction of NiS/NiFe2O4 interfaces during the irradiation of plasma energy is identified. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that in situ phase reconfiguration is crucial for synergistically reducing energetic barriers and accelerating reaction kinetics toward catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result; it leads to an overpotential of 230 mV @10 mA cm−2 for the OER and a half-wave potential of 0.81 V for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); as well as an excellent zinc−air battery (ZAB) performance with a power density of 148.5 mW cm−2.

Trimetallic Sulfide Hollow Superstructures with Engineered d-Band Center for Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide in Alkaline Solution,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.High-performance transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) as electrocatalysts for two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR) in alkaline medium are promising for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, but their synthesis remains challenging. In this work, a titanium-doped zinc–cobalt sulfide hollow superstructure (Ti–ZnCoS HSS) is rationally designed as an efficient electrocatalyst for H2O2 electrosynthesis. Synthesized by using hybrid metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors after sulfidation treatment, the resultant Ti–ZnCoS HSS exhibits a hollow-on-hollow superstructure with small nanocages assembled around a large cake-like cavity. Both experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the polymetallic composition tailors the d-band center and binding energy with oxygen species. Moreover, the hollow superstructure provides abundant active sites and promotes mass and electron transfer. The synergistic d-band center and superstructure engineering at both atomic and nanoscale levels lead to the remarkable 2e-ORR performance of Ti–ZnCoS HSS with a high selectivity of 98%, activity (potential at 1 mA cm−2 of 0.774 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), a H2O2 production rate of 675 mmol h–1 gcat–1, and long-term stability in alkaline condition, among the best 2e-ORR electrocatalysts reported to date. This strategy paves the way toward the rational design of polymetallic TMCs as advanced 2e-ORR catalysts.",Advanced Science

This undoubtedly evidences that, for metal sulfides, the atom-scale cation/anion vacancy pair and surface electronic spin state can play a great role in enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction. Inspired by the theoretical prediction, interconnected selenium (Se) wired ultrathin Co3S4 (Sex-Co3S4) nanosheets with Co/S (Se) dual-vacancies (Se1.0-Co3S4-VS/Se-VCo) pairs are constructed by a simple approach. As an efficient sulfur host material, in an ultralow-concentration KOH solution (0.1 m), Se1.0-Co3S4-VS/Se-VCo presents outstanding durability up to 165 h and a low overpotential of 289.5 mV at 10 mA cm–2, which outperform the commercial Co3S4 nanosheets (NSs) and RuO2. Moreover, the turnover frequency of Se1.0-Co3S4-VS/Se-VCo is 0.00965 s–1 at an overpotential of 0.39 V, which is 5.7 times that of Co3S4 NSs, and 5.8 times that of commercial RuO2. The finding offers a rational design strategy to create the multi-defect structure in catalysts toward high-efficiency water electrolysis.",Small

Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are regarded as the most promising next-generation energy storage systems due to their high energy density and cost-effectiveness. However, their practical applications are seriously hindered by several inevitable drawbacks, especially the shuttle effects of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) which lead to rapid capacity decay and short cycling lifespan. This review specifically concentrates on the shuttle path of LiPSs and their interaction with the corresponding cell components along the moving way, systematically retrospect the recent advances and strategies toward polysulfides diffusion suppression. Overall, the strategies for the shuttle effect inhibition can be classified into four parts, including capturing the LiPSs in the sulfur cathode, reducing the dissolution in electrolytes, blocking the shuttle channels by functional separators, and preventing the chemical reaction between LiPSs and Li metal anode. Herein, the fundamental aspect of Li–S batteries is introduced first to give an in-deep understanding of the generation and shuttle effect of LiPSs.

Applications of Machine Learning in Alloy Catalysts: Rational Selection and Future Development of Descriptors,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.At present, alloys have broad application prospects in heterogeneous catalysis, due to their various catalytic active sites produced by their vast element combinations and complex geometric structures. However, it is the diverse variables of alloys that lead to the difficulty in understanding the structure-property relationship for conventional experimental and theoretical methods. Fortunately, machine learning methods are helpful to address the issue. Machine learning can not only deal with a large number of data rapidly, but also help establish the physical picture of reactions in multidimensional heterogeneous catalysis. The key challenge in machine learning is the exploration of suitable general descriptors to accurately describe various types of alloy catalysts, which help reasonably design catalysts and efficiently screen candidates.

A Library of ROS-Catalytic Metalloenzyme Mimics with Atomic Metal Centers,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Metal-N-coordinated centers supported by carbonaceous substrates have emerged as promising artificial metalloenzymes (AMEs) to mimic the biocatalytic effects of their natural counterparts. However, the synthesis of well-defined AMEs that contain different atomic metal-N centers but present similar physicochemical and coordination structures remains a substantial challenge. Here, 20 different types of AMEs with similar geometries and well-defined atomic metal-N-coordinated centers are synthesized to compare and disclose the catalytic activities, substrate selectivities, kinetics, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products. Their oxidase (OXD)-, peroxidase (POD)-, and halogen peroxidase (HPO)-mimetic catalytic behaviors are systematically explored. The Fe-AME shows the highest OXD- and HPO-mimetic activities compared to the other AMEs due to its high vmax (0.927 × 10−6 m s−1) and low Km (1.070 × 10−3 m), while the Cu-AME displays the best POD-like performance. Furthermore, theoretical calculation reveals that the ROS-catalytic paths and activities are highly related to the electronic structures of the metal centers. Benefiting from its facile adsorption of H2O2 molecule and lower energy barrier to generating •O2−, the Fe-AME displays higher ROS-catalytic performances than the Mn-AME. The engineered AMEs show not only remarkably high ROS-catalytic performances but also provide new guidance toward developing metal-N-coordinated biocatalysts for broad application fields.",Advanced Materials
Coupling of N-Doped Mesoporous Carbon and N-Ti3C2 in 2D Sandwiched Heterostructure for Enhanced Oxygen Electroreduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.2D heterostructures provide a competitive platform to tailor electrical property through control of layer structure and constituents. However, despite the diverse integration of 2D materials and their application flexibility, tailoring synergistic interlayer interactions between 2D materials that form electronically coupled heterostructures remains a grand challenge. Here, the rational design and optimized synthesis of electronically coupled N-doped mesoporous defective carbon and nitrogen modified titanium carbide (Ti3C2) in a 2D sandwiched heterostructure, is reported. First, a F127-polydopamine single-micelle-directed interfacial assembly strategy guarantees the construction of two surrounding mesoporous N-doped carbon monolayers assembled on both sides of Ti3C2 nanosheets. Second, the followed ammonia post-treatment successfully introduces N elements into Ti3C2 structure and more defective sites in N-doped mesoporous carbon. Finally, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and theoretical calculation prove the synergistic coupled electronic effect between N-Ti3C2 and defective N-doped carbon active sites in the 2D sandwiched heterostructure. Compared with the control 2D samples (0.87–0.88 V, 4.90–5.15 mA cm−2), the coupled 2D heterostructure possesses the best onset potential of 0.90 V and limited density current of 5.50 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, this catalyst exhibits superior methanol tolerance and cyclic durability. This design philosophy opens up a new thought for tailoring synergistic interlayer interactions between 2D materials.",Small
A High-Efficiency Mo2C Electrocatalyst Promoting the Polysulfide Redox Kinetics for Na–S Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries, as promising next-generation energy storage candidates, are drawing more and more attention due to the high energy density and abundant elements reserved in the earth. However, the native downsides of RT Na-S batteries (i.e., enormous volume changes, the polysulfide shuttle, and the insulation and low reactivity of S) impede their further application. To conquer these challenges, hierarchical porous hollow carbon polyhedrons embedded with uniform Mo2C nanoparticles are designed deliberately as the host for S. The micro- and mesoporous hollow carbon indeed dramatically enhances the reactivity of the S cathodes and accommodates the volume changes. Meanwhile, the highly conductive dispersed Mo2C has a strong chemical adsorption to polysulfides and catalyzes the transformation of polysulfides, which can effectively inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides and accelerate the reaction kinetics. Thus, the as-prepared S cathode can display a high reversible capacity (1098 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 120 cycles) and superior rate performance (483 mAh g−1 at 10.0 A g−1). This work provides a new method to boost the performance of RT Na–S batteries.",Advanced Materials
Boosting nitrogen reduction to ammonia on Fe–N3S sites by introduction S into defect graphene,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSingle-atom catalysts have demonstrated their superiorities over other forms of catalysts for various reactions. Herein, we successfully implant Fe-isolated single atoms into N, S-co-doped defective graphene architecture (Fe–SAs/NSDG) as a highly efficient catalyst for N2 reduction. X-ray photoelectron spectra, X-ray absorption fine structure characterizations and density functional theory calculation revealed that Fe atoms are anchored to the carrier via the Fe–N3S coordination configuration. The density functional theory calculations identify that Fe–N3S as the active site can promote nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). It is worth noting that the introduction of S can greatly increase catalyst NRR activity. The obtained catalyst exhibits a strong activity for NRR with the highest ammonia yield rate of 28.89 μg/h·mg/cat at −0.4 V and the highest Faradaic efficiency of 23.7% at −0.1 V, respectively. These results demonstrate that the Fe–SAs/NSDG can be a promising cathode material for NRR.",Materials Today Energy

Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.With a decade of effort, significant progress has been achieved in the synthesis, processing, and applications of MXenes. Metal ions play many crucial roles, such as in MXene delamination, structure regulation, surface modification, MXene composite construction, and even some unique applications.

Design Rules of a Sulfur Redox Electrocatalyst for Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Seeking an electrochemical catalyst to accelerate the liquid-to-solid conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides to insoluble products is crucial to inhibit the shuttle effect in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries and thus increase their practical energy density. Mn-based mullite (SmMn2O5) is used as a model catalyst for the sulfur redox reaction to show how the design rules involving lattice matching and 3d-orbital selection improve catalyst performance. Theoretical simulation shows that the positions of Mn and O active sites on the (001) surface are a good match with those of Li and S atoms in polysulfides, resulting in their tight anchoring to each other. Fundamentally, dz2 and dx2−y2 around the Fermi level are found to be crucial for strongly coupling with the p-orbitals of the polysulfides and thus decreasing the redox overpotential. Following the theoretical calculation, SmMn2O5 catalyst is synthesized and used as an interlayer in a Li–S battery. The resulted battery has a high cycling stability over 1500 cycles at 0.5 C and more promisingly a high areal capacity of 7.5 mAh cm−2 is achieved with a sulfur loading of ≈5.6 mg cm−2 under the condition of a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) value ≈4.6 µL mg−1.",Advanced Materials
"Graphitic Aza-Fused π-Conjugated Networks: Construction, Engineering, and Task-Specific Applications","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.2D π-conjugated networks linked by aza-fused units represent a pivotal category of graphitic materials with stacked nanosheet architectures. Extensive efforts have been directed at their fabrication and application since the discovery of covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs). Besides the triazine cores, tricycloquinazoline and hexaazatriphenylene linkages are further introduced to tailor the structures and properties.

Synergetic Anion Vacancies and Dense Heterointerfaces into Bimetal Chalcogenide Nanosheet Arrays for Boosting Electrocatalysis Sulfur Conversion,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Vacancy and interface engineering are regarded as effective strategies to modulate the electronic structure and enhance the activity of metal chalcogenides. However, the practical application of metal chalcogenides in lithium−sulfur (Li−S) batteries is limited by their low conductivity, rapid decline in catalytic activity, and large volume variation during the discharging/charging process. Herein, bimetal sulfide (CoZn-S) nanosheet arrays with sulfur vacancies and dense heterointerfaces are proposed to accelerate sulfur conversion and improve the performance of Li−S batteries. Systematic investigations reveal that sulfur-vacancy and build-in interfacial field in CoZn-S facilitate the electron transfer and regulate the electronic structure. The well-designed 3D nanosheet array structures shorten the ion-transport pathway and inhibit the volume fluctuation of CoZn-S during the electrocatalysis process. Density functional theory studies confirm that the built-in interfacial field and sulfur vacancy can promote the thermodynamic formation and decomposition of Li2S, thus improving their intrinsic activity.",Advanced Materials
A Mott–Schottky Heterogeneous Layer for Li–S Batteries: Enabling Both High Stability and Commercial-Sulfur Utilization,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) are severely impeded by their poor cycling stability and low sulfur utilization due to the inevitable polysulfide shuttle effect and sluggish reaction kinetics. This work reports a Mott–Schottky RGO-PANI/MoS2 (RPM) heterogeneous layer modified separator for commercial-sulfur-based LSBs through the vertical growth of molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) arrays on the polyaniline (PANI) in situ reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Due to the synergistic effects of the “reservoir” constructed by MoS2 and RGO-PANI, strong absorbability, high conductivity, and electrocatalytic activity, RPM exhibits a successive “trapping–interception–conversion” behavior toward lithium polysulfides. As a result, the LSBs assembled using a commercial-sulfur as the cathode and RPM as modified layer exhibit high sulfur utilization (3.8 times higher than that of the unmodified separator at 5 C), excellent rate performance (553 mAh g−1 at 10 C), and outstanding high-rate cycle stability (524 mAh g−1 after 700 cycles at 5 C). Moreover, even at a high sulfur loading of 5.4 mg cm−2, a favorable areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm−2 is still maintained after 80 cycles. Theoretical calculations elucidate that such a systematic strategy can effectively suppress the shuttling effect and boost the catalytic conversion of intercepted polysulfides. This work may provide a feasible strategy to promote the practical application of commercial-sulfur-based LSBs.",Advanced Energy Materials
Recent Advances in Oxidation Stable Chemistry of 2D MXenes,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.As an emerging star of 2D nanomaterials, 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, named MXenes, present a large potential in various research areas owing to their intrinsic multilayer structure and intriguing physico-chemical properties. However, the fabrication and application of functional MXene-based devices still remain challenging as they are prone to oxidative degradation under ambient environment.

Furthermore, the chemistry of MXene-derived oxides is analyzed, which can offer perspectives on the further design and fabrication of novel 2D composites with the unique structures of MXenes being preserved.",Advanced Materials
Vapor phosphorus-coated cobalt vanadate as a high-performance anode for a lithium-ion battery,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Vanadate-based synthesis of battery electrodes has become a topic of research interest due to the high lithium storage performance. However, the rapid capacity decay seriously hinders its practical application. In order to improve the potential for Co3V2O8 (CVO) as an electrode in lithium batteries, a Na5V12O32 nanowire precursor with a smooth surface was obtained using the hydrothermal method. Next, the CVO nanowires assembled by nanosheets were fabricated by cation exchange from the Na5V12O32 precursor. Finally, the elemental phosphorus-coated CVO was successfully synthesized by a custom furnace. The characterization of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-ES) quantified the ratio of P and CVO, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the presence and coverage. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) further demonstrated the existence and morphology of P and CVO. Meanwhile, electrochemical measurements illustrated the stable lithium storage and notable rate performance of the P-CVO electrode as compared to AN-CVO. The P-CVO electrode holds a higher stable cycle performance after 190 cycles, with discharge specific capacity of 415.3 mA h g−1 and capacity retention of 97% at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 (872 mA h g−1, 2.0 A g−1, 98.8%), versus AN-CVO with 320.6 mA h g−1 (capacity retention of 79.5%) after only 100 cycles. Thence, the synthetic strategy provides a potential solution to enhance the stability of electrodes for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry
Boosting Fast Sodium Ion Storage by Synergistic Effect of Heterointerface Engineering and Nitrogen Doping Porous Carbon Nanofibers,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Heterointerface engineering with multiple electroactive and inactive supporting components is considered an efficient approach to enhance electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to rationally design heterointerface engineering and understand the synergistic effect reaction mechanisms. In this paper, the two-phase heterointerface engineering (Sb2S3 and FeS2) is well designed to incorporate into N-doped porous hollow carbon nanofibers (Sb-Fe-S@CNFs) by proper electrospinning design. The obtained Sb-Fe-S@CNFs are used as anode in SIBs to evaluate the electrochemical performance. It delivers a reversible capacity of 396 mA h g–1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A g–1 and exhibits an ultra-long high rate cycle life for 16 000 cycles at 10 A g–1. The admirable electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the following reasons: The porous carbon nanofibers serve as an accelerator of the electrons/ions and a buffer to alleviate volume expansion upon long cyclic performance. The abundant phase boundaries of Sb2S3/FeS2 exert low Na+ adsorption energy and greatly promote the charge transfer in the internal electric field calculated by first-principle density functional theory. Therefore, the as-prepared Sb-Fe-S@CNFs represents a promising candidate for an efficient anode electrode material in SIBs.",Small

Tungsten Nanoparticles Accelerate Polysulfides Conversion: A Viable Route toward Stable Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries are arousing great interest in recent years. Their practical applications, however, are hindered by several intrinsic problems, such as the sluggish kinetic, shuttle effect, and the incomplete conversion of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs). Here a sulfur host material that is based on tungsten nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene is reported. The incorporation of tungsten nanoparticles significantly accelerates the polysulfides conversion (especially the reduction of Na2S4 to Na2S, which contributes to 75% of the full capacity) and completely suppresses the shuttle effect, en route to a fully reversible reaction of NaPSs. With a host weight ratio of only 9.1% (about 3–6 times lower than that in recent reports), the cathode shows unprecedented electrochemical performances even at high sulfur mass loadings. The experimental findings, which are corroborated by the first-principles calculations, highlight the so far unexplored role of tungsten nanoparticles in sulfur hosts, thus pointing to a viable route toward stable Na–S batteries at room temperatures.",Advanced Science
In-Situ Synthesis of Carbon-Encapsulated Atomic Cobalt as Highly Efficient Polysulfide Electrocatalysts for Highly Stable Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have been considered as one of the most promising electrochemical energy storage systems because of their high energy density. However, a series of issues severely limit the practical performances of Li–S batteries such as low conductivity, significant volume change, and shuttle effect. The hollow carbon spheres with huge voids and high electrical conductivity are promising as sulfur hosts. Unfortunately, the nonpolar nature of carbon materials cannot prevent the shuttle effect effectively. In this case, the atomic cobalt is introduced to a nitrogen-doped hollow carbon sphere (ACo@HCS) through polymerization and controlled pyrolysis. The atomic cobalt dopants not only act as active sites to restrict the shuttle effect, but also can promote the kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions. ACo@HCS acting as sulfur host exhibits a high discharge capacity (1003 mAh g−1) at a 1.0 C rate after 500 cycles, and the corresponding decay rate is as low as 0.002% per cycle. This exciting work paves a new way to design high-performance Li–S batteries.",Small
Electronic Localization Derived Excellent Stability of Li Metal Anode with Ultrathin Alloy,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium metal is an ideal anode for next-generation high-energy-density batteries. However, lithium dendrite growth has impeded its commercial application. Herein, fabricating Li-based ultrathin alloys with electronic localization and high surface work function via depositing Bi, Al, or Au metals on the surface of copper foil for in situ alloying with lithium is proposed. It is discovered that the electronic localization can induce self-smoothing effect of Li ions, as a result, significantly suppressing the growth of dendritic lithium. Meanwhile, the high surface work function can effectively alleviate side reactions between the electrolyte and lithium. With the as-obtained ultrathin alloys as anodes, excellent cycling performance is achieved. The half cells run stably after more than 120 cycles under high capacity of 4 mAh cm−2. The S||Bi/Cu-Li full cell delivers a specific capacity of 736 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles.

Modulating the Local Coordination Environment of Single-Atom Catalysts for Enhanced Catalytic Performance in Hydrogen/Oxygen Evolution Reaction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) hold the promise of utilizing 100% of the participating atoms in a reaction as active catalytic sites, achieving a remarkable boost in catalytic efficiency. Thus, they present great potential for noble metal-based electrochemical application systems, such as water electrolyzers and fuel cells. However, their practical applications are severely hindered by intrinsic complications, namely atom agglomeration and relocation, originating from the uncontrollably high surface energy of isolated single-atoms (SAs) during postsynthetic treatment processes or catalytic reactions. Extensive efforts have been made to develop new methodologies for strengthening the interactions between SAs and supports, which could ensure the desired stability of the active catalytic sites and their full utilization by SACs. This review covers the recent progress in SACs development while emphasizing the association between the regulation of coordination environments (e.g., coordination atoms, numbers, sites, structures) and the electrocatalytic performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The crucial role of coordination chemistry in modifying the intrinsic properties of SACs and manipulating their metal-loading, stability, and catalytic properties is elucidated.

Enhanced chemisorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides via CoFe@NC nanocubes modified separator for superior Li–S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The coordination mechanism of adjusting the chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides plays a key role in the development of high energy density lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, a CoFe alloy is locked in situ in nitrogen-doped carbon nanocube (denoted as CoFe@NC) as a bifunctional separator modification material for Li-S batteries. The obtained CoFe@NC nanocubes exhibit strong chemisorption and catalytic conversion activity of double polysulfides, leading to the enhanced redox kinetics and the reduced polysulfide shuttle effect for Li-S batteries. As expected, the batteries assembled with CoFe@NC modified separator (CoFe@NC//PP batteries) show high specific capacity and long cycle stability. Specifically, the CoFe@NC//PP batteries exhibit a high initial specific capacity of 1473 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, excellent rate capacity of 604 mA h g−1 at 4C, as well as superior cycle stability with the capacity decay rate of only 0.059% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 1C. Additionally, the satisfactory electrochemical performance can be achieved even in the case of high sulfur loading (6.60 mg cm−2) and low electrolyte (E/S is about 7 μL mg -1). Therefore, this work provides a reliable reference to develop effective intermetallic compounds with chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Porous carbon textile decorated with VC/V2O3-X hybrid nanoparticles: Dual-functional host for flexible Li-S full batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The polysulfide shuttling at the cathode and lithium dendrite formation at the anode remain as major obstacles to overcome for the realization of high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Here, via a facile one-pot synthesis using carbothermic reduction, we prepared a porous and flexible carbon textile uniformly decorated with VC/V2O3-x hybrid nanoparticles, which was used as a robust and flexible host material for both sulfur cathode and Li metal anode. We observed that the defective V2O3-x part traps polysulfides and the conductive VC part catalytically enhances the fragmentation of the polysulfides. Moreover, it was found that the well-distributed VC/V2O3-x nanoparticles act as lithiophilic sites to lead uniform lithium nucleation for a dendrite-free lithium metal anode. The full battery delivered superb rate performance (882 mAh g − 1 at 5 C) and an ultralow decay rate of 0.02% per cycle during 1000 cycles at 1 C. Even with a large sulfur loading of 7.0 mg cm−2, a high areal capacity of 6.29 mAh cm−2 at 0.2 C was obtained.

Synergistic activation of peroxymonosulfate by MnO/Fe3C encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanosheets for the enhanced degradation of bisphenol A,"© 2022Our work is mainly focused on the N-doped porous carbon nanosheets with metal or metal oxide catalysts embedded for the activation of peroxymonosulfate. MOF derived MnO/Fe3C encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanosheets (MnO/Fe3C@NC) with controlled structure have been synthesized and showed more excellent performance than traditional Fe/Mn-based catalyst as a PMS activator. Specifically, in this study, the magnetic MnO/Fe3C@NC-1 catalyst as peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator was successfully fabricated by calcination of Mn and Fe-based bimetallic organic framework (MnFe-MOF-74), which was converted into mix-phased MnO and Fe3C. The system of PMS + MnO/Fe3C@NC-1 completely degraded 10 mg/L of bisphenol A (BPA) in less than 20 min. The MnO/Fe3C@NC-1 exhibited better activity in PMS activation than MnO@NC and Fe/Fe3C@NC, indicating that the synergistic effect between MnO and Fe3C could be beneficial to enhance the catalytic performance. The competitive radical quenching technique and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements revealed that both SO4•− and •OH might be mainly generated. Various influential factors affecting catalytic performance were systematically investigated. The magnetic catalyst also manifested an excellent stable performance in heterogeneous BPA oxidation for several runs. We believe that this work will provide a new prospect for the synthesis of MOF-derived catalysts with high catalytic performance for PMS activation.",Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering
Stabilized Li metal anode with robust C-Li3N interphase for high energy density batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The combination of commercial high-voltage cathode and a thin lithium metal anode has emerged as a promising approach to realize rechargeable high energy density lithium batteries. However, abundant challenges, including huge volume change of Li metal and its severe side reactions with electrolyte for wide electrochemical potential window, hamper the practical application of lithium metal anode in high energy density batteries. In this work, we reported a Li/graphene composite electrode with in situ formed robust C/Li3N interphase (Li/graphene-C/Li3N electrode). Stabilized by the graphene framework, the electrode can endure large volume change during lithium stripping/plating cycles and realize stable cycling. The Li3N protection layer can not only help the composite electrode to avoid the direct physical contact between active metallic lithium and electrolyte, and suppress the side reactions between them, but also help to homogenize Li+ diffusion and plating/stripping behaviors due to its high ionic conductivity. As a result, the composite structure and electrochemical interphase stability enable superior electrochemical performance of the Li/graphene-C/Li3N electrodes. As a demonstration, the Li/graphene-C/Li3N symmetric cell displayed a low and stable overpotential for more than 1000 hours at 1 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2. LCoO2||Li/graphene-C/Li3N cell delivered a high energy density of 694.05 Wh kg−1 in the working potential range between 2.8 V and 4.6V and displayed high Coulombic efficiency of over 99% for more than 150 cycles, showing promising for practical high energy density lithium metal batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
"Element-dependent unique properties of Janus Cr2I3X3 (X = F, Cl, Br) monolayer: Insight from first-principles calculations","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Two-dimensional (2D) intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors are important to develop low-dimensional spintronic devices. The recent discovery of FM CrI3 monolayer provides ample opportunities for the spintronic applications of atomically thin magnets. Breaking the structural inversion symmetry of CrI3 would result in some extraordinary physical characteristics. Through first-principles calculations, here we systematically studied the structural, electronic, magnetic and mechanical properties of 2D Janus Cr2I3X3 (X = F, Cl, Br) monolayers, and compared them with those of the pure CrX3 monolayers. The results show that the properties of the Janus Cr2I3X3 (X = F, Cl, Br) monolayers are not within the range between CrI3 and CrX3, but go beyond this range. With the decrease of the atomic number of X elements, from Br to F, the properties of Cr2I3X3 increasingly deviate from that of CrI3 or CrX3. All the element-dependent properties of Cr2I3X3 are closely related with the charge redistribution and structural distortion, which is originated from the substitution of Iodine atoms with X atoms (atomic layer substitution) in the Janus structures. Our study enriches the diversity of Janus 2D materials, and provides the theoretical guidance for the application in spintronic devices.",Materials Science and Engineering B: Solid-State Materials for Advanced Technology
"A microstructure engineered perovskite super anode with Li-storage life of exceeding 10,000 cycles","© 2022 Elsevier LtdRechargeable lithium-ion batteries have largely promoted our modern civilization in the past few decades. However, nowadays lithium ion technology is still dominated by the early invented materials which suffer from low volumetric capacity and limited cycle life. Herein, a Li-ion-conducting perovskite material Li0.33La0.56Ti0.9Ni0.1O3-δ is synthesized as a new anode material. After carbon coating and in-situ Ni-exsolution, this novel engineered material emerges as a super anode (Super A©) with all-around outstanding characteristics compared with other counterparts including the state-of-the-art anode graphite. This new anode has a low working potential (1 V vs. Li+/Li), high reversible capacity (352 or 457 mAh g−1 under different modes), ultra-long cycle life (over 10,000 cycles at 2 A g−1), excellent fast-charge, low-temperature and anti-overcharge performances. Particularly, Super A© can achieve a rather high volumetric capacity up to 2267 Ah L−1 (vs. 608, 837 and 2062 Ah L−1 for Li4Ti5O12, graphite and lithium, respectively). Based on quantumchemical calculations, we propose a new lithium storage mechanism in coupling vacancies existing in the perovskite structure. This work presents a promising next-generation anode material for commercial lithium-ion products. It also provides a new methodology to design ceramic-based electrode materials for the electrochemical rechargeable batteries.",Nano Energy
The transcendental role of lithium zirconates in the development of modern energy technologies,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.In the context of the current global environmental paradigm, lithium zirconate-based materials (LZOs) are of great technological interest in the reduction of the carbon footprint. Due to their exceptional mechanical, thermal and chemical stability, high lithium atom density and outstanding tritium release behavior, LZOs have been studied as tritium breeding ceramics for fusion technology. Besides, given that they can selectively and reversibly absorb CO2 at high temperatures, LZOs could be used in the capture and industrial reuse of this gas. Moreover, in their most widespread use today, LZOs could be applied as nanocoatings on solid-state electrolytes and electrodes, constraining the formation of high resistive interfaces and slowing the evolution of dendrites, both in lithium-ion and solid-state batteries. Finally, there are some small contributions in the development of catalytic materials to produce biodiesel and air-hydrogen fuel cells based on LZOs, and also in the development of luminescent materials with photovoltaic applications. This article is the first review of the LZO system. It summarizes LZOs main applications and describes the latest advances in the technologies described above.",Ceramics International
Enhanced redox kinetics based on Mo2C-C/Fe3C electrocatalyst for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Due to high energy density and theoretical capacity, lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for next-generation secondary batteries. Nevertheless, sluggish redox reaction kinetics and irreversible capacity loss limit its commercial application. Herein, Mo2C-C/Fe3C composite with synergistic effect serving as host material for Li–S batteries is reported. The strong polar chemical adsorption capacity of Mo2C and its synergistic catalytic effect with Fe3C nanoparticles effectively inhibit the shuttle effect and improve the utilization of active substances. Meanwhile, the carbon substrate acts as a conductive network to achieve rapid charge transfer. Mo2C-C/Fe3C electrode material combining high electrical conductivity, valid catalytic activity, and strong polar chemisorption ability exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The Mo2C-C/Fe3C cathode based on Li–S batteries delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1203.4 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and 587.1 mAh g−1 at 2 C.",Ionics
Functional catalysts for polysulfide conversion in Li–S batteries: from micro/nanoscale to single atom,"© 2021, Youke Publishing Co.,Ltd.Lithium−sulfur (Li–S) batteries have the advantages of low-cost and ultra-high energy density (2600 Wh·kg−1), which have attracted considerable attention. However, the practical application of Li–S batteries still suffers various intractable problems, such as low electrical conductivity, significant volume expansion, and the shuttle effect of sulfur cathode. Up to now, many tremendous efforts and significant progress have been devoted to settle these problems. One of the most effective strategies is that introducing metal-based compounds (e.g., metal oxides, -sulfides, -nitrides, carbides, -phosphate, single-metal compounds) to enhance the electrochemical performance of S cathode benefiting from superior adsorption/catalytic ability toward Li2Sn (n = 1, 2, 4, 8). In this review, we summarized the recent advances in the application of micro/nanoscale catalysts in Li–S system and highlighted the catalytic effect of single-atom compounds. Finally, the challenges and the future research prospects of single-atom catalysts were discussed. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Rare Metals
Coordinatively Deficient Single-atom Fe-N-C Electrocatalyst with Optimized Electronic Structure for High-performance Lithium-sulfur Batteries,"© 2021The rationally-designed single-atom catalyst that promotes efficient sulfur electrochemistry is highly desired yet still challenging for the development of high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, the deficient coordination of single-atom Fe site is firstly and theoretically predicted to endorse higher sulfur affinity and catalytic activity, due to the stronger hybridization between Fe 3dzz and S 3py orbitals compared with that in common FeN4 scenario. The following validation is conducted to prepare the monodispersed Fe single atoms with tuned coordination number on nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as FeN2-NC and FeN4-NC) via the ligand control on the Fe precursor. As expected, the undercoordinated FeN2-NC fulfills significantly stronger sulfur immobilization and catalyzation as confirmed by a series of physicochemical and electrochemical evaluations. As a result, sulfur electrodes hosted by FeN2-NC realize excellent cyclability and rate capability, and particularly, a highly reversible areal capacity up to 4.5 mAh cm−2 under a high areal sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm−2 and a low electrolyte to sulfur ratio of 5.3 mL g−1. This work highlights the great feasibility and validity of coordinative defect engineering in single-atom catalysts for improving the Li-S battery electrochemistry, which could also enlighten advanced material designs in other related energy areas.",Energy Storage Materials

The adjustable textural structures, well-defined channels and abundant charged sites of ionic COFs facilitate great potential in diverse aspects, such as separation, ion conduction, sensing, catalysis and energy storage. In this review, we first introduced the design and construction of ionic covalent organic frameworks(COFs), and classified them according to the types of charged sites. We focused on the various applications of ionic COFs in diverse fields. The structure-function relationship was also explored in detail. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of ionic COFs were summarized to provide guidance for better design and application of ionic COFs.",Chemical Research in Chinese Universities
High 1T phase and sulfur vacancies in C-MoS2@Fe induced by ascorbic acid for synergistically enhanced contaminants degradation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Applicating co-catalyst into Fenton-like advanced oxidation processes to improve the performance for wastewater remediation has attracted widespread attention. Among them, developing highly active and green heterogeneous catalyst integrating homogeneous ferrous ions and inorganic co-catalyst is a great challenge. Herein, ascorbic acid additive was creatively introduced into the precursor composed of thiourea, sodium molybdate and ferric chloride to synthesize carbon intercalated molybdenum disulfide anchoring iron (C-MoS2@Fe) by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. C-MoS2@Fe exhibited an amazing apparent first-order constant as high as 0.739 min−1 about 10 times higher than that of the homogeneous Fe2+/MoS2 system for the sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal and achieved 68.7% removal of TOC in 6 min, which was attribute to the synergistic enhancement of high 1T phase (82.0%) and sulfur vacancies induced by the introduction of ascorbic acid. Notably, the C-MoS2@Fe was also capable of efficiently degrading multiple organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, phenolic compounds, and organic dyes. Compared with the homogeneous Fe2+/PMS system, the C-MoS2@Fe/PMS system expanded the effective pH range (2.0 ∼ 9.0) and the ultralow iron ions leaching (0.204 mg L-1) avoided the formation of iron containing sludge. The results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), radical quenching and probe experiments indicated that •OH was the main active species with the contribution rate about 60.3%. Furthermore, possible degradation pathways were proposed based on the intermediate products of SMX investigated by LC-MS. This study provides novel insights for the development of highly active and green catalysts for wastewater remediation.",Separation and Purification Technology
Dual-Functional NbN Ultrafine Nanocrystals Enabling Kinetically Boosted Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Herein, NbN nanocrystals immobilized on N-doped carbon nanosheets to functionalize a polypropylene (PP) membrane (NbN@NC/PP) with a thin coating of only 4 µm are designed and synthesized. The functional modifier layer allows for sulfur-involved transformations and also lithium plating behaviors. On the one hand, the sulfur cell with NbN@NC/PP separator exhibits excellent cycling stability and rate capacity. The good electrochemical performance partially results from the strong chemical interactions between NbN and lithium polysulfides via the formation of Nb-S and N-Li bonds, which is proven by the first-principles calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The formation of tiny nanoscrystals (<2 nm) and clusters tends to maximize the surface of NbN to interact with polysulfides and enable the effective catalysis over the sulfur-involved reactions. The higher exchange current density and Li+ diffusion coefficient of NbN@NC/PP cells experimentally verify that the introduction of NbN indeed catalytically accelerates the reaction kinetics. On the other hand, the performance of Li//Li symmetric cells demonstrates that the NbN@NC modifier layer can well induce homogeneous lithium deposition. This work confirms the application potential of NbN in lithium–sulfur batteries and encourages the exploration of prospective nitrides to engineer high performance next-generation batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
"In situ simultaneously integrating Co-N-C sites and Co9S8 nanoparticles into N,S-doped porous carbon as trifunctional electrocatalysts for Zn–air batteries driving water splitting","© 2022 Elsevier LtdDeveloping cost-effective, but efficient and stable trifunctional catalysts synchronously for oxygen reduction (ORR), oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under same electrolytes is essential for the real application of renewable energy systems. Herein, we report the synthesis of a cheap and high-efficiency electro-catalyst based on Co9S8 nanoparticles decorated with Co-N-C sites well anchored to metal-porous organic polymer (MPOP)-derived N, S-codoped carbon (Co-IM-POP-1000), which exhibits pronounced trifunctional electrocatalytic activity for ORR, OER and HER, simultaneously, in alkaline media. Consequently, breathing Zn–air batteries (ZABs) employing Co-IM-POP-1000 as the sole catalysts present prominent performance, i. e., the charge/discharge voltage, power and energy density, specific capacity, rate performance as well as the lifetime, outperforming that of Pt/C 20% + RuO2 counterparts, which could be regenerated and maintained at the same performance level for subsequent runs by simply replenishing the Zn anode and electrolyte. An alkaline water splitting system using the IM-POP-Co-1000 as catalyst for overall water splitting affords a cell voltage as low as 1.60 V at 10 mA cm−2. A self-driven water splitting system powered by the home-made ZABs is demonstrated using IM-POP-Co-1000 as the sole catalyst in 0.1 M KOH, giving a high H2 evolution rate of 0.244 mmol h−1. These novel metal-POPs provides an effective strategy to prepare high-performance POPs for special applications. Therefore, this study shows a promising approach for the utilization of low cost and massive producible POPs as precursor for the preparation of stable and efficient trifunctional electro-catalyst toward clear energy applications.",Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering
Synergistic Electronic and Pore Structure Modulation in Open Carbon Nanocages Enabling Efficient Electrocatalytic Production of H2O2 in Acidic Medium,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through 2e– oxygen reduction reaction is an effective approach to replace anthraquinone process. However, most reported electrocatalysts work effectively in alkaline medium in which H2O2 will easily decompose into water. It is still of great challenge to develop cost-effective electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for electrocatalytic H2O2 production in acidic media. Herein, it is first theoretically demonstrated that the adsorption energy of OOH* intermediate on carbon can be optimized by embedding Co nanoparticles (Co NPs) and tuning oxygen-containing functional groups, ensuring high activity and selectivity. Guided by density functional theory calculations, highly porous open carbon nanocages with embedded Co NPs are designed and synthesized by template-engaged method. The pyrolysis temperature can effectively modulate the electronic and pore structure of carbon nanocages. Impressively, the optimized carbon nanocages synthesized at 700 °C (P-Co@C-700) with highest percentage of –C–O–C group and defects, largest specific surface area (1351 m2 g–1), and mesoporous structure exhibit high selectivity up to 94% toward H2O2 production in 0.1 m HClO4. Furthermore, the P-Co@C-700 nanocages display promising application for efficient electro-Fenton degradation of model organic pollutant.",Advanced Functional Materials
Toward Excellence of Electrocatalyst Design by Emerging Descriptor-Oriented Machine Learning,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a powerful tool for identifying quantitative structure–activity relationships to accelerate electrocatalyst design by learning from historic data without explicit programming. The algorithms, data/database, and descriptors are usually the decisive factors for ML and the descriptors play a pivotal role for electrocatalysis as they contain the essence of catalysis from the physicochemical nature. Despite the considerable research efforts regarding electrocatalyst design with ML, the lack of universal selection tactics for descriptors bridging the gap between structures and activity impedes its wider application. A timely summary of the application of ML in electrocatalyst design helps to deepen the understanding of the nature of descriptors and improve the application scope and design efficiency. This review summarizes the geometrical, electronic, and activity descriptors used as input for ML training and predicting to reveal the general rules for their application in the design of electrocatalysts. In response to the challenges of hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction, the ML application in these areas is tracked for the progress and prospective changes. Additionally, the potential application of the automated design and discovery are discussed for the other well-known electrocatalytic processes.",Advanced Functional Materials
Mapping Techniques for the Design of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Mapping technique has been the powerful tool for the design of next-generation energy storage devices. Unlike the traditional ion-insertion based lithium batteries, the Li-S battery is based on the complex conversion reactions, which require more cooperation from mapping techniques to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Therefore, in this review, the representative works of mapping techniques for Li-S batteries are summarized, and categorized into the studies of lithium metal anode and sulfur cathode, with sub-sections based on shared characterization mechanisms. Due to specific features of mapping techniques, various aspects such as compositional distribution, in-plain/cross section characterization, coin cell/pouch cell configuration, and structural/mechanical analysis are emphasized in each study, aiming for the guidance for developing strategies to improve the battery performances. Benefited from the achieved progresses, suggestions for future studies based on mapping techniques are proposed to accelerate the development and commercialization of the Li-S battery.",Small
Functionalization of mesoporous carbons derived from pomelo peel as capacitive electrodes for preferential removal/recovery of copper and lead from contaminated water,"© 2022Water is not only a valuable resource that is needed to sustain life, but also an essential ingredient in many engineering processes, which unavoidably leads to large volumes of water being contaminated. To achieve safe discharge and also recover valuable “pollutants”, better performing sorbents are needed to rapidly and efficiently decontaminate water while generating minimal secondary wastes. Bio-sorbents derived from pomelo peel were functionalized with pyrrolic-N (BNC-5 electrode) and pyridinic-N (BNC-6 electrode) to enhance electroadsorption and selectivity of Pb2+ and Cu2+. The interaction between soft acid ions (Pb2+) and soft base sites (pyrrolic-N) contributed to a strong chemisorption that elevated the electroadsorption capacity to 2.0 mmol g−1 for Pb2+ at an applied voltage of 1.2 V. With fast removal kinetics (0.077 g mg−1 min−1 of Pb2+), the BNC-5 sorbent performed comparably to other N-doped sorbents prepared using graphene. The large adsorption–desorption hysteresis of BNC-5 in responding to the applied electric voltage confirmed the nature of chemisorption. The results showed only 32.4% of the adsorbed ions being desorbed from the sorbent by reducing the applied voltage to 0 V, but reached almost complete desorption (98.5% of adsorbed ions) at –0.8 V. When operated in adsorption–desorption cycle mode, BNC-5 after ∼ 400 cycles maintained a capacity retention ≥ 80%. After 400 cycles, the electrode capacity was almost fully restored (98.7%) by only mild chemical washing (0.1 M HNO3) of the sorbent and the cycling performance maintained. The study demonstrated the robustness of the sorbent over 1200 cycles and hence the potential to successfully convert waste into high-performance materials for large-scale remediation strategies of contaminated wastewater using CDI.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Engineering Gd2O3-Ni heterostructure for efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalysis via the electronic reconfiguration and adsorption optimization of intermediates,"© 2022A 3D nano-aerogel electrocatalyst is produced based on metal Ni combined with Gd2O3 species through a facile hydrogel route. The synthetic method hinges on the fabrication of oxidized carbon nanotubes (OCNTs) crosslinked poly (vinyl alcohol) to form hydrogel, which permits effective catch of highly active Gd2O3/Ni particles after pyrolysis. The designed Gd2O3-Ni heterostructure on carbon nanotubes (Gd2O3-Ni/CNT) is highly efficient for oxygen reduction electrocatalysis. It is found that the half-wave potential (E1/2) of Gd2O3-Ni/CNT is nearly 190 mV positive than that of Ni/CNT and even surpasses the commercial Pt/C. The superior performance is resulted from the electronic reconfiguration between Gd2O3 and Ni in the heterostructure, which further optimized the adsorption of intermediates to balance the binding of OOH* and OH* on the surface of Gd2O3-Ni and break the OOH*–OH* scaling relation. Finally, the assembled zinc-air battery with Gd2O3-Ni/CNT as electrocatalyst achieves high capacity.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Emerging new-generation covalent organic frameworks composites as green catalysts: design, synthesis and solar to fuel production","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Due to structural versatility, permanent porosity, low mass densities, and exceptional stability, covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) have received great interest in green catalysis.

The review offers the recent advances in variant categories of green COFs composites, synthesis routes, and their applications as sustainable catalyst. Mainly, we focused on the green reaction parameters, including chemical reactions under solvent-free or mild conditions, which endorses their wide-range applicability at both industrial and scientific stages. Lastly, an outlook on the ongoing challenges and prospects for the future advancement of COFs composites are presented.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Nitrogen-containing carbon hollow nanocube-confined cobalt nanoparticle as a magnetic and efficient catalyst for activating monopersulfate to degrade a UV filter in water,"© 2022While bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) ketone (BHK) represents one of the most typical UV filters, which, however, exhibits xenohormone toxicities, very few studies exist for investigating elimination of BHK from water. As sulfate radical-based oxidation processes are validated for degrading emerging contaminants, this current work attempts developing advantageous sulfate radical-based processes through activating monopersulfate (MPS) for eliminating BHK in water. Since cobalt (Co)-containing catalysts are effective catalysts for MPS activation, this study proposes to develop a Co NP-containing catalyst, in which Co NPs are confined in hollow N-containing carbon nanocube (HCoNC) derived from a cobaltic metal-organic framework (Co-MOF). The cubic Co-MOF would be firstly afforded through a surfactant-assisted method. The resultant cubic Co-MOF would be then modified with tannic acid (TAA) to etch its interior for affording the cubic Co-MOF with the hollow structure, which is subsequently converted into Co NP-containing hollow N- containing carbon nanocube (HCoNC) through carbonization. HCoNC can exhibit significantly superior catalytic activities than the non-hollow CoNC and Co3O4 nanoparticles for MPS activation to BHK degradation. The activation energy (Ea) for degrading BHK by MPS is 45.3 kJ/mol, which is much lower than reported values. HCoNC could be reusable over 5 consecutive BHK degradation cycles without decreasing catalytic activities. The MPS activation and plausible BHK degradation route by HCoNC+MPS is elucidated by experimental investigations as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculation to provide insightful mechanism of BHK degradation process.",Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering
High-Efficiency Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Oxygen Reduction Enabled by a Tungsten Single Atom Catalyst with Unique Terdentate N1O2 Coordination,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have shown great potential in the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, current studies are mainly focused on 3d transition-metal SACs, and very little attention has been paid to 5d SACs. Here, a new kind of W SAC anchored on a porous O, N-doped carbon nanosheet (W1/NO-C) is designed and prepared via a simple coordination polymer-pyrolysis method. A unique local structure of W SAC, terdentate W1N1O2 with the coordination of two O atoms and one N atom, is identified by the combination of aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. Remarkably, the as-prepared W1/NO-C catalyzes the ORR via a 2e– pathway with high onset potential, high H2O2 selectivity in the wide potential range, and excellent operation durability in 0.1 m KOH solution, superior to most of state-of-the-art H2O2 electrocatalysts ever reported. Theoretical calculations reveal that the C atoms adjacent to O in the W1N1O2-C moiety are the most active sites for the 2e– ORR to H2O2 with the optimal binding energy of the HOO* intermediate. This work opens up a new opportunity for the development of high-performance W-based catalysts for electrochemical H2O2 production.",Advanced Functional Materials
Efficient anodic chemical conversion to boost hydrogen evolution with low energy consumption over cobalt-doped nickel sulfide electrocatalyst,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic oxidation of small molecules to replace sluggish water oxidation presents a promising strategy for clean hydrogen production with low energy consumption. Herein, we reported a reliable and universal method to fabricate the leaf-like Co-doped Ni3S2 architecture anchored on Ni mesh. The optimized Co-doped Ni3S2 electrocatalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and chemical oxidation as well as excellent durability. Specifically, a significantly reduced cell voltage of 0.80 V is attained at 50 mA cm−2 in sulfion-containing electrolytes, which is about 0.94 and 1.20 V lower than that of urea electrolysis and water splitting, respectively. In situ Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical characterization results imply that the desired oxidation state of the NiIII formed on the surface with shortened oxidation pathway accounts for the increased urea oxidation, whereas a direct electron transfer to surface active sites is responsible for superior sulfion oxidation. In situ spectroscopic evidences further unravel that the sulfion (S2−) were stepwisely oxidized to short-chain polysulfides including S22− and S42− and then to elemental sulfur (S8). This work highlights that the integrated overall reaction holds the great promise for saving-energy H2 generation and environmentally friendly recovery of sulfur with enhanced electron utilization efficiency.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Biomass vs inorganic and plastic-based aerogels: Structural design, functional tailoring, resource-efficient applications and sustainability analysis","© 2022 The AuthorsThe highly efficient utilization of bioresources and natural organic wastes has attracted great attention, due to the high-speed consumption and shortage of energy in modern society. Aerogels, attributable to their outstanding properties and potential applications in diverse fields, have been a major topic of innovative materials research in the last decades. While previously the scientific community has mainly focused on inorganic- and plastic-based aerogels, recent years have witnessed a growing interest in their biomass-based counterparts. In fact, numerous studies on the fabrication, modification, and applications of cellulose, polysaccharide, protein, peptide, and other bio-derived aerogels have been widely reported. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the biomass-based aerogels field. The analysis that we perform ranges from their structural design to routes for functional tailoring, and encompasses resource-efficient applications; the aim is to provide a comprehensive review based on a robust analysis of available data. The fabrication techniques, structure and properties of biomass-based aerogels are introduced, together with their chemical, mechanical, electrical, optical, and biological properties. In addition, the structural design, functional tailoring, and applications of biomass-based aerogels are demonstrated. Furthermore, we enrich the actual literature state-of-the-art with a broad sustainability analysis, that compares biomass-based aerogels to the most studied inorganic/plastic-based counterparts. To this end, we perform a comparison with inorganic- and plastic-based aerogels by sustainability footprint analysis, which accounts for 12 sustainability parameters on environmental, social, and techno-economic impacts. This review will guide readers in understanding the fabrication of biomass-based aerogels, together with their structural and functional adjustment, through comprehensively presenting the state-of-the-art on their sustainable applications in fields as diverse as biomedical engineering, energy materials, nanodevices, chemical engineering, and environmental science.",Progress in Materials Science
In situ and operando characterisation of Li metal – Solid electrolyte interfaces,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe use of lithium metal as the negative electrode holds great promise for high energy density solid-state batteries (SSBs) of the future, but at the same time presents major technical challenges in their development. Li metal, with its high reactivity, soft and ductile nature, and propensity towards mechanical deformation during electrochemical cycling, is susceptible to the formation of various defects such as voids, cracks and filamentary deposits at the Li metal - solid electrolyte interface, that eventually cause rapid degradation of electrochemical cell performance. In order to gain insights into these interfacial processes and identify mechanisms for failure, in situ and operando characterisation approaches are essential. In this perspective, we present our opinions on the current state of such techniques, while highlighting the existing limitations and scope of these methods. We also endeavour to present opportunities for future research into developing and building on existing approaches to better evaluate the Li metal-solid electrolyte interface so as to guide the appropriate choice of materials to further enable efficient SSB architectures.",Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science
Lignocellulosic biomass carbonization for biochar production and characterization of biochar reactivity,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLignocellulosic biomass (LB) pyrolysis and gasification technologies for bio-oil, syngas and process heat have been widely described, and biochar, as a significant byproduct of LB pyrolysis, has also received increasing attention because of it global sustainability. Biochar is attractive to researchers, mainly due to the value of its activity and reactivity, bringing the possibility of achieving carbon utilization and carbon neutralization. However, few studies have systematically described the changes in chemical composition and structure of LB during its carbonization process, as well as the origin of produced biochar's reactivity. A better understanding of what chemical substances have facilitated biochar reactivity and how they function is needed, which is of great value for environmental remediation analysis and green application strategy formulation. Herein, the new insights into the possible decomposition/transformation mechanisms of LB to functionalized biochar were discussed. Subsequently, the basic structure of lignocellulosic biomass derived biochar (LBC) was studied, and its reactivity-related compositions were also summarized. More importantly, discussion was expanded on the origin of LBC's reactivity and the reactivity expression ways. And the outlook section will highlight insights into future directions and prospects, aiming to overcome current limitations by developing more methods and exploring other green applications.",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
Two-dimensional cluster catalysts with superior thermal stability and catalytic activity for AP,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe preparation of catalysts with small particle size, large specific surface area and high atomic utilization has always been the focus of research in the field of catalysis. As for energetic materials, catalysts are always used to improve the thermal decomposition performance of ammonium perchlorate (AP) as it has significant effect on the power of engine. In this work, a two-dimensional metal clusters catalyst has been successfully prepared by solvothermal and heat treatment to improve thermal decomposition performance of AP. In detail, the transition metal ions were supported on the graphene oxide (GO) surface by organic ligands linking, followed by heat treatment to obtain two-dimensional rGO based metal clusters catalyst. The morphology and structure of the catalysts at different temperatures and their effect on AP decomposition were studied, the results show that catalyst at 300 °C has a particle size of 20 nm and uniformly distributed on rGO. The catalyst promotes the high temperature decomposition of AP by 73.7 °C with improved stability, and increases the heat release from 652.73 J/g to 1392.11 J/g. This may be attributed to good conductivity of GO and the strong gain-loss electron ability of the metal clusters. The presence of GO increased the active sites for cluster catalysis, additional, the metal clusters have a positive synergistic effect with GO. Thus, the thermal decomposition performance of AP was enhanced meanwhile thermal stability can also be improved.",Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids
Regulating Polysulfide Redox Kinetics on a Self-Healing Electrode for High-Performance Flexible Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Wearable electronics require lightweight and flexible batteries, of which lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are of great interest due to their high gravimetric energy density. Nevertheless, flexible Li-S batteries have unsatisfactory electrochemical performance owing to electrode fracture during repeated bending, the volume change of sulfur species and the severe shuttle effect. Binders play essential roles in these batteries but have always lacked attention. Herein, a self-healing polyvinylpyrrolidone-polyethyleneimine (PVP-PEI) binder cross-linked by hydrogen bonds, which also regulates polysulfide redox kinetics, is reported. The dynamic hydrogen-bonding networks repair the cracks and ensure the integrity of the electrode while numerous polar groups such as C=O and -NH2 suppress the shuttle effect by immobilizing polysulfides. Therefore, Li-S batteries with the PVP-PEI binder exhibit excellent cycling stability (a capacity decay rate of 0.0718% per cycle at 1 C after 450 cycles), an outstanding areal capacity of 7.67 mAh cm−2 even under a high sulfur loading (7.1 mg cm−2) and relatively lean electrolyte conditions (E/S ratio = 8 µL mg−1). Flexible Li-S pouch cells using the PVP-PEI binder show a stable performance for 140 cycles and a favorable capacity retention of over 95% after 2800 bending cycles, confirming its application potential in high-performance flexible Li-S batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
A novel method to synthesize high-strength elastic gel and carbonized aerogel,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Carbon aerogels have expanded the trend of the catalytic, adsorption, super capacitor field, and so on. Unfortunately, the real-world applications of porous carbon materials are limited because of the high cost, complicated preparation process and poor mechanical properties. Herein, we report an extremely simple and novel method to prepare carbon aerogels. Based on the principles of two-step curing including acid curing and heat curing, we develop a elastic Phenol-formaldehyde resin gel (PFRG) with high strength (18.9 MPa) from Phenol-formaldehyde resin (PFR) by controlling the loss of solvent in the process. Due to the robust network of RFRG, the Phenol-formaldehyde resin carbon aerogels (PFRCAs) can be directly procured through a tube furnace. The obtained PFRCAs possess macroporous/microporous hierarchical structure with high mechanical strength of 11.2 MPa and low thermal conductivity (0.0381 Wm/K). These results show that the proposed method can be promoted as a universal and promising method for preparing aerogel with thermosetting resin, which has driven a wider industrial utilization of aerogel and thermosetting resin.",Applied Surface Science
Surface engineered polar CeO2-based cathode host materials for immobilizing lithium polysulfides in High-performance Li-S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The particle morphology of CeO2 nanocrystals with different exposed crystal facets is a crucial factor influencing the surface-related materials performance. In this report, shape-controlled synthesis of CeO2 nanocrystals with various preferentially exposed crystal facets (CeO2 nanorods with (1 1 0)/(1 0 0)/(1 1 1), CeO2 nanocubes with (1 0 0) and CeO2 nanoctahedra with (1 1 1)) was conducted aiming to investigate the crystal plane effect of polar CeO2 as a cathode host on the immobilization of lithium polysulfides and electrochemical performance of the assembled Li-S batteries. The strong chemical bonding between lithium polysulfides and CeO2 host, including Ce-S and Li-O bonds formed on the exposed (1 1 0)/(1 0 0) and defected (1 1 1) crystal facets of CeO2 nanorods during reversible electrochemical conversion from soluble long-chain polysulfides to insoluble short-chain Li2S/Li2S2, results in superb diffusion restriction of lithium polysulfides towards Li anode and endows CeO2 nanorods@CC electrode with a superior electrochemical property among three tested electrodes of CeO2 nanorods@carbon cloth (CC), CeO2 nanocubes@CC, and CeO2 nanoctahedra@CC. However, such strong chemical interaction against polysulfides was not observed by CeO2 nanocubes with preferentially exposed (1 0 0) crystal planes and CeO2 nanoctahedra with preferentially exposed (1 1 1) crystal planes. In addition to the factor of the exposed crystal planes, CeO2 nanorods possess defect-rich surfaces (i.e., oxygen vacancies and Ce3+) also serving as possible polysulfides anchoring sites, which can contribute to effective immobilization of lithium polysulfides. Benefiting from the above-mentioned advantages, CeO2 nanorods are considered as an outstanding candidate of cathode host materials for long life and high-performance Li-S batteries.",Applied Surface Science

The flower-like Cu9S8 with super large macroporous (d = 133.78 nm) was prepared using porous CuO that was synthesized by the sacrificial template method. The peroxidase mimics activity of flower-like Cu9S8 was determined by catalytic oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) with H2O2. The kinetic constants (Km = 0.449 mM) displayed that the flower-like Cu9S8 showed excellent affinity to H2O2, which was 8 times lower than that of horseradish peroxidase (HRP).

"Theoretical Predictions, Experimental Modulation Strategies, and Applications of MXene-Supported Atomically Dispersed Metal Sites","© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Atomically dispersed metal sites (ADMSs) attract immense attention because they can be used in the fields of energy and environmental protection as they are characterized by high atomic utilization efficiency and exhibit high activity. Various supports for anchoring isolated metal atoms are developed to construct ADMSs characterized by highly stable and well-defined structures. This can be achieved by increasing the number of anchoring sites and reinforcing metal–support interactions. MXenes, a new series of 2D nanomaterials, exhibit promising potential in stabilizing isolated metal atoms because of their large specific surface areas and unique surface properties. The high conductivity and hydrophilicity of MXenes can be attributed to the nature of surface functionalization and the properties of tunable structures of the materials. Benefiting from these excellent properties, MXenes can find their applications in various fields.

Systematic investigation of experimental parameters on nitrogen incorporation into carbon nanotube forests,"© 2021 The Author(s)Nitrogen doping carbon nanotubes can enhance their beneficial physical and chemical properties, rendering them more desirable for various applications, e.g., in electronics. In this study, we used catalytic chemical vapor deposition to synthesize carbon na-no-tube forests on different substrates. The samples were prepared in the presence of compounds containing nitrogen (ammonia, acetonitrile, tripropylamine, and their mixture with acetone) that were introduced into the reactor by bubbling or injection. Of the two different nitrogen introduction methods, the direct injection of a liquid nitrogen precursor promoted the synthesis of bamboo-structured carbon nanotube forests more efficiently. It was found in the injection experiments that the amount of precursor affected the extent of nitrogen incorporation. The presence of various nitrogen species in CNTs was also identified, and the manner in which temperature and the presence of hydrogen both influence nitrogen incorporation into the carbon na-no-tubes was observed.",Materials Research Bulletin
"Structural, electronic, and optical properties of C3B and C3B0·5N0.5 monolayers: A many-body study","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Performing first-principles calculations, the structural, electronic, and optical properties of C3B and C3B0·5N0.5 monolayers are investigated systematically. The calculations of cohesive energies, molecular dynamics, and phonon spectra show the energetic, thermal, and dynamical stabilities of C3B and C3B0·5N0.5 monolayers. The C3B0·5N0.5 (C3B) is predicted to be semiconductors with moderate direct (indirect) gap of 2.376 (1.948) eV at G0W0 level. The observed systems both have good absorptions for the visible light. Compared with that of the C3B, first absorption peak of the C3B0·5N0.5 is remarkably red-shifted, suggesting an enhanced absorption for the near-infrared light. The corresponding bright excitons have large binding energies, being 0.913 eV for the C3B and 0.704 eV for the C3B0·5N0.5, respectively. The relatively small binding energy of exciton in the C3B0·5N0.5 is very beneficial for the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pair. More importantly, the C3B0·5N0.5 monolayer can achieve a large light absorption coefficient beyond 105 cm−1 for the sunlight irradiation. These findings enrich the deep understanding of C3B and C3B0·5N0.5 monolayers, and indicate their potential applications in optoelectronics.",Physica E: Low-Dimensional Systems and Nanostructures

Catalytic Mo2C decorated N-doped honeycomb-like carbon network for high stable lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries hold promise as next-generation high energy density devices due to their high theoretical capacities. However, their commercialization confronts great challenges, in particular the notorious shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics, making it difficult to realize high sulfur loading and cell energy density properties.

Nanosized Mo2C embedded porous carbon network (Mo2C@PCN) are prepared through the pyrolysis of molybdenum and chitosan precursor. Both electrochemical performance and theoretical calculations reveal that introducing the Mo2C can not only enhance the affinity toward the polysulfide intermediate, but also significantly accelerate the polysulfide interconversion compared with that of the pristine porous carbon network (PCN), thereby endowing the Li-S batteries with excellent cycling stability with a low capacity decay of 0.034 % per cycle over 600 cycles, and superb rate capability of 644 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Boosting alkaline hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis through electronic communicating vessels on Co2P/Co4N heterostructure catalyst,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Developing highly efficient non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for sustainable fuel production. Although great efforts have been devoted to promoting the alkaline HER kinetics through accelerating the sluggish water dissociation step by incorporation of oxophilic sites, these strategies are mainly limited to constructing metal/hydroxide interface or heteroatoms doping. Herein, we report a rational construction of Co2P/Co4N heterostructure catalyst with a unique electronic communicating vessels (ECV) formed at the interface between Co4N phase and Co2P phase. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results reveal that the ECV at the interface is beneficial for regulating the electronic structures of the two phases, and thereby leads to optimized adsorption strength of reaction intermediates (*H2O and *H), contributing to the outstanding alkaline HER performance with an overpotential of 40 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2. This study opens a new avenue for tailoring the electronic structures through fabrication of electronic communicating vessels in the heterostructure electrocatalysts with enhanced electrocatalytic performances.",Chemical Engineering Journal
The Introduction of Defects in Ti3C2Tx and Ti3C2Tx-Assisted Reduction of Graphene Oxide for Highly Selective Detection of ppb-Level NO2,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.At present, the main gas-sensing mechanism of oxidized MXene (Ti3C2Tx) is commonly regarded as Schottky barrier modulation, but the influence of surface defects generated by oxidation is ignored and ambiguous. Herein, oxidized Ti3C2Tx crumpled spheres (MS) are obtained, accompanying numerous surface defects through thermal oxidation of MS synthesized by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technology and gas-sensing properties of oxidized MS with Ti3C2Tx/TiO2 crumpled spheres (MT-10-1) without new surface defects are compared. It is demonstrated that the significant improvement of the gas-sensing properties of oxidized MS is due to the introduction of Ti atom defects rather than Ti3C2Tx/TiO2 heterojunction in-situ generated by oxidation. First-principles density functional theory calculations show that Ti atom vacancy can greatly improve the adsorption ability of Ti3C2Tx to gases (especially for NO2). Subsequently, with the facile oxidability, Ti3C2Tx is utilized as a reductant to assist the reduction of graphene oxide, and Ti3C2Tx/TiO2/rGO crumpled spheres are subtly designed and successfully synthesized for further enhancing the gas-sensing performance. The MG-2-1 sensor achieves a low detection limit of NO2 (10 ppb), great NO2 selectivity, and high NO2 response. The clarification of the gas-sensing mechanism of oxidized Ti3C2Tx and the utilization of oxidation of Ti3C2Tx provide a new idea for the application of MXenes.",Advanced Functional Materials
An integrated approach to improve the performance of lean–electrolyte lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesWhile the sulfur conversion reaction kinetics in Li–S batteries is nowadays improved by the use of appropriate electrocatalysts, it remains a challenge for the batteries to perform well under the lean electrolyte condition where polysulfide shuttle, electrode passivation and the loss of electrolyte due to side reactions, are aggravated. These challenges are addressed in this study by the tandem use of a polysulfide conversion catalyst and a redox–targeting mediator in a gel sulfur cathode. Specifically, the gel cathode reduces the polysulfide mobility and hence the polysulfide shuttle and the passivation of the lithium anode by the crossover polysulfides. The redox mediator restrains the deposition of inactive sulfur species in the cathode thereby enabling the Fe–N and Co–N co–doped carbon catalyst to prolong its catalytic activity. Consequently, the integrated catalytic system is able to increase the discharge capacity of high–loading (6.8 mg cm−2) lean–electrolyte (4.0 µL mg−1) Li–S batteries from ∼630 to ∼1316 mAh g−1, concurrently with an improvement of the cycle life (600 cycles with 46% capacity retention at 1.0 mA cm−2). Redox mediator assisted catalysis in a gel cathode is therefore an effective strategy to extend the application of the sulfur conversion catalyst in lean electrolyte Li–S batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
MXenes nanocomposites for energy storage and conversion,"© 2021, Youke Publishing Co.,Ltd.Abstract: The development of two-dimensional (2D) high-performance electrode materials is the key to new advances in the fields of energy storage and conversion. As a novel family of 2D layered materials, MXenes possess distinct structural, electronic and chemical properties that enable vast application potential in many fields, including batteries, supercapacitor and catalysis. However, MXene layers are easily formed by stacking together, which significantly reduces the specific surface area, hinders the transmission of ions, and restricts other functional materials on the surface, thereby reducing performance. In addition, due to the inherent defects of a single electrode material, electrodes or catalysts made of single-phase MXene may not meet specific practical application requirements. MXenes nanocomposites materials based on enhanced electrochemical performance through nano-engineering technology and surface modification for morphological control are highly sought after to solve these challenges. This review aims to present recent advances in these emerging MXene nanocomposites for energy storage and conversion applications such as batteries, supercapacitors and catalytic reactions.

Interface engineering of metal phosphide on hollow carbons by Dual-template method for High-performance Lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Tailoring well-dispersed nanoparticles on the sulfur host with high catalytic activity is of great importance yet remains challenging in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, a novel multi-phase interface structure of embedded CoP and Co2P nanoparticles (CoxP NPs) on hollow N-doped carbon substance (CoxP/NC) was successfully fabricated by the in-situ conversion of ZIF-67@ZIF-8 dual templates. The abundant multi-phase interfaces on CoxP/NC enabled efficient lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) capture, accelerated Li-ion diffusion, and boosted LiPSs conversion, thus forming a rapid and robust “adsorption-diffusion-conversion” network. Moreover, the well-defined hollow carbon polyhedrons physically inhibit the LiPSs diffusion and provide superior conductivity. As a result, the assembled S@CoxP/NC cathode with a high sulfur loading of 82% delivers an excellent rate capability (617.7 mAh g−1 at 3C), impressive stability (a small capacity decay of 0.053% per cycle over 1250 cycles at 1C), and favorable durability of thick sulfur cathodes (with a high areal sulfur loading of 4.68 mg cm2 over 300 cycles).",Chemical Engineering Journal

Carbon dots decorated on the ultrafine metal sulfide nanoparticles implanted hollow layered double hydroxides nanocages as new-type anodes for potassium-ion batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Although layered double hydroxides (LDH) stands out among various electrode materials with considerable theoretical capacities, the intrinsically poor electronic conductivity and inevitable aggregations of the fragile 2D structure impede their practical application in rechargeable metal-ion battery. In the present work, nickel/cobalt LDH hollow nanocages derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were synthesized. Afterward, the ultrafine metal sulfide nanoparticles were implanted into the LDH nanocages (LDH-S) through a in-situ sulfide method. Such a LDH-S architecture achieves an initial discharge capacity of 1387 mAh g−1 and stable specific capacity of 391 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 200 cycles while using as potassium-ion battery anode material. In addition, when LDH-S nanocages are decorated with carbon dots (CDs@LDH-S), it exhibits an excellent long-term lifespan achieving 188 mAh g−1 after 8000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. With the aid of ex-situ characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the excellent performance of CDs@LDH-S can be contributed to the hetero-structure, in which the interlayer confinement of ultrafine metal sulfides enhances the electrical/ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the well-defined internal voids and functional shells promise intimate contact between the electrolyte and electrode material, and also could avoid agglomeration during repeated potassium-ion insertion and extraction process. In addition, the presence of carbon dots (CDs) further enhances the electrical conductivity and stabilizes the electrode structure. This work proves that LDH-based anode with high capacity and low cost may be one of the promising candidates for potassium-ion storage and the introduction of CDs maybe an efficient way for construction of high-efficient electrode materials for potassium-ion storage.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Novel honeycomb-like carbons with tunable nanopores as metal-free N, O-codoped catalysts for robust oxygen reduction","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Metal-free carbon nanomaterials doped with heteroatoms are deemed as promising alternatives to platinum for O2 reduction in fuel cell and metal-air batteries. To boost the catalytic activity, construction of nanoporous structured carbons with exposed active sites and improved ions/gas mass transport capability is the main research objective. However, controlled preparation of carbon materials with uniform morphology and tunable nanopore sizes is still a great challenge. Herein, a novel furfuryl alcohol-derived, N, O-codoped nanoporous carbon (FANC) with honeycomb-like structure is reported, which possesses high uniformity and controllable pore sizes. Four FANCs with various pore sizes were carefully prepared and their electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were systematically investigated. Among the four FANCs, the one with a pore size of 12 nm (FANC-12) receives the best ORR performance, which is close to that of commercial Pt/C in alkaline electrolyte. A high power density of 174.1 mW cm−2 was obtained with FANC-12 as cathode catalyst in a flexible solid-state zinc-air battery. Calculation by density functional theory reveals the possible structure of this novel N, O-codoped carbon material and also demonstrates that pyridinic N species are the active sites, which is consistent with the experimental result.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Isolated Co single atoms in nitrogen-doped graphene for aluminum-sulfur batteries with enhanced kinetic response,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesAl-S batteries are promising next generation energy storage devices due to their high theoretical energy density (1340 Wh kg−1), low cost, and safe operation. However, the electrochemical performance of Al-S batteries suffers poor reversibility owing to slow kinetic processes determined by the difficulty of reversible conversion between Al and S. Here, we proposed a single-atom catalysts comprising Co atoms embedded in a nitrogen-doped graphene (CoNG) as an electrochemical catalyst in the sulfur cathode that renders a reduced discharge-charge voltage hysteresis and improved sulfur utilization in the cathode. The structural and electrochemical analyses suggest that the CoNG facilitated both the formation and oxidation of AlSx during the electrochemical reactions of the sulfur species. Consequently, the CoNG-S composite can deliver a considerably reduced voltage hysteresis of 0.76 V and a reversible specific capacity of 1631 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 with a sulfur utilization of more than 97%.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

Bidirectionally catalytic polysulfide conversion by high-conductive metal carbides for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesUtilizing catalysts to accelerate the redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is a promising strategy to alleviate the shuttle effect of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. Nevertheless, most of the reported catalysts are only effective for LiPSs reduction, resulting in the devitalization of catalysts over extended cycles as a consequence of the continuous accumulation of Li2S passivation layer. The situation gets even worse when employing mono-directional catalyst with poor electron conductivity because the charge transfer for the decomposition of solid Li2S is severely hampered. Herein, a high-conductive and dual-directional catalyst Co3C decorated on porous nitrogen-doped graphene-like structure and carbon nanotube (Co3C@PNGr-CNT) is fabricated as sulfur host, which not only promotes the precipitation of Li2S from LiPSs during discharge but also facilitates the decomposition of Li2S during subsequent charge, as evidenced by the reduced activation energies for both reduction and oxidation processes. Furthermore, the long-term catalytic stability of Co3C is corroborated by the reversible evolution of Co–C bond length over extended cycles as observed from X-ray absorption fine structure results. As a consequence, the fabricated Co3C@PNGr-CNT/S cathode delivers a low capacity decay of 0.043% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2C. Even at high sulfur loading (15.6 mg cm−2) and low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio (∼8 μL mg−1) conditions, the battery still delivers an outstanding areal capacity of 11.05 mAh cm−2 after 40 cycles. This work provides a rational strategy for designing high-efficient bidirectional catalyst with single component for high-performance Li-S batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

Effects of conductive additives on the percolation networks and rheological properties of LiMn0.7Fe0.3PO4 suspensions for lithium slurry battery,"© 2021In depth understanding the evaluation behaviors of conductive percolation networks and rheological properties is important for developing high performance suspension electrodes. Herein, three kinds of conductive additives, Ketjen Black, multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoplatelets, are utilized to systematically investigate the impacts of dimension and content on the rheological and electrochemical properties of LiMn0.7Fe0.3PO4 suspensions. The percolation threshold ranges are found to be 0.5–0.6 wt.%, 0.2–0.3 wt.% and 2.3–2.4 wt.% for KB, MWCNT and GNP-based suspensions, respectively. The inflection points for electronic conductivities of different conductive additives based suspensions are situated at 1.0 wt.%, 0.5 wt.% and 2.5 wt.%, respectively, and the static viscosities and yield stresses of KB and MWNCT-based suspensions possess the same inflection points as those of electronic conductivities. Nevertheless, GNP-based suspensions deliver a distinguishing tendency due to their relatively poor dispersion. Electrochemical characterizations indicate that 1.5 wt.% KB-based suspension delivers superior cycle and rate performances. Especially, the successful application of LMFP suspension to lithium slurry battery was demonstrated by a relatively stable cycle over 230 h. Our findings will be helpful for the development of lithium slurry batteries with robust conductive networks and high energy density.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Interfacial engineering of 3D hollow CoSe2@ultrathin MoSe2 core@shell heterostructure for efficient pH-universal hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Rational design and construction of low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is meaningful but challenging. Herein, a robust three dimensional (3D) hollow CoSe2@ultrathin MoSe2 core@shell heterostructure (CoSe2@MoSe2) is proposed as an efficient HER electrocatalyst through interfacial engineering. Benefitting from the abundant heterogeneous interfaces on CoSe2@MoSe2, the exposed edge active sites are maximized and the charge transfer at the hetero-interfaces is accelerated, thus facilitating the HER kinetics. It exhibits remarkable performance in pH-universal conditions. Notably, it only needs an overpotential (η10) of 108 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA·cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH, outperforming most of the reported transition metal selenides electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil that the heterointerfaces synergistically optimize the Gibbs free energies of H2O and H* during alkaline HER, accelerating the reaction kinetics. The present work may provide new construction guidance for rational design of high-efficient electrocatalysts. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research
Rare-earth single atom based luminescent composite nanomaterials: Tunable full-color single phosphor and applications in WLEDs,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.High-quality single-component white phosphors are instrumental in realizing high-efficiency devices. Rare earth fluorides and carbon quantum dots have great potential in the white light-emitting diode (WLED) field due to their unique advantages. Here, Rare-earth single atom based NaGdF4:Tb3+/Eu3+@C:N/Eu3+ single phosphor with tunable full-color luminescence was reported. The results of density functional theory (DFT) calculation and experimental characterization show that C atoms cannot be replaced by Eu3+, but C atoms are more favorable for anchoring Eu3+ single atoms. The DFT was employed to optimize the structures of the C:N/Eu3+ and NaGdF4:Tb3+/Eu3+, and calculate the work function, optical properties, and charge density difference. The obtained tunable full-color single phosphor can emit stable light from blue to red or even white. The constructed WLED devices also have stable and excellent color performance, that is, a color rendering index of up to 95 and a lower color temperature, and it has broad application possibilities in WLEDs.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research
Nafion-threaded MOF laminar membrane with efficient and stable transfer channels towards highly enhanced proton conduction,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Porous laminar membranes hold great promise to realize ultrafast ion transfer if efficient and stable transfer channels are constructed in vertical direction. Here, metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets bearing imidazole molecules in the pores were designed as building blocks to assemble free-standing MOF laminar membrane. Then, Nafion chains were threaded into the pores induced by electrostatic attraction from imidazole molecules by slowly filtering dilute Nafion solution. We demonstrate that the threaded Nafion chains lock adjacent MOF nanosheets, affording highly enhanced structural stability to the resultant laminar membrane with almost no water swelling. Significantly, abundant acid-base pairs are formed in the pores along Nafion chains, working as efficient, continuous conduction pathways in vertical direction. Proton conductivities as high as 110 and 46 mS·cm−1 are obtained by this membrane under 100% and 40% relative humidity (RH), respectively, which are two orders of magnitude higher than that of pristine MOF membrane. The conductivity under low humidity (40% RH) is even over 2 times higher than that of commercial Nafion membrane, generating the maximum power density of 1,100 mW·cm−2 in hydrogen fuel cell (vs. 291 mW·cm−2 of Nafion membrane). Besides, the influence of water state on proton transfer in confined space is investigated in detail. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research
Phosphorus incorporation activates the basal plane of tungsten disulfide for efficient hydrogen evolution catalysis,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The basal planes of transition metal dichalcogenides are basically inert for catalysis due to the absence of adsorption and activation sites, which substantially limit their catalytic application. Herein, a facile strategy to activate the basal plane of WS2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysis by phosphorous-induced electron density modulation is demonstrated. The optimized P doped WS2 (P-WS2) nanowires arrays deliver a low overpotential of 88 mV at 10 mA·cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 62 mV·dec−1 for HER, which is substantially better than the pristine counterpart. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the surface electron densities of WS2 have been availably manipulated by P doping. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) studies further prove P doping can redistribute the density of states (DOS) around EF, which endow the inert basal plane of P-WS2 with edge-like catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution catalysis. Our work offers a facile and effective approach to modulate the catalytic surface of WS2 toward highly efficient HER catalysis. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano Research
Structure search of two-dimensional systems using CALYPSO methodology,"© 2022, Higher Education Press.The dimensionality of structures allows materials to be classified into zero-, one-, two-, and three-dimensional systems.

Characterization of polymeric surfaces and interfaces using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry,"© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is used for chemical analysis of surfaces. ToF-SIMS is a powerful tool for polymer science because it detects a broad mass range with good mass resolution, thereby distinguishing between polymers that have similar elemental compositions and/or the same types of functional groups. Chemical labeling techniques that enhance contrast, such as deuterating or staining one constituent, are generally unnecessary. ToF-SIMS can generate both two-dimensional images and three-dimensional depth profiles, where each pixel in an image is associated with a complete mass spectrum. This Review begins by introducing the principles of ToF-SIMS measurements, including instrumentation, modes of operation, strategies for data analysis, and strengths/limitations when characterizing polymer surfaces. The sections that follow describe applications in polymer science that benefit from characterization by ToF-SIMS, including thin films and coatings, polymer blends, composites, and electronic materials. The examples selected for discussion showcase the three standard modes of operation (spectral analysis, imaging, and depth profiling) and highlight practical considerations that relate to experimental design and data processing. We conclude with brief comments about broader opportunities for ToF-SIMS in polymer science.",Journal of Polymer Science
High-Entropy Spinel Oxide Nanofibers as Catalytic Sulfur Hosts Promise the High Gravimetric and Volumetric Capacities for Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Zhengzhou University.The exploration of new catalytic hosts is highly important to tackle the sluggish electrochemical kinetics of sulfur redox for achieving high energy density of lithium–sulfur batteries. Herein, for the first time, we present high-entropy oxide (HEO, (Mg0.2Mn0.2Ni0.2Co0.2Zn0.2)Fe2O4) nanofibers as catalytic host of sulfur. The HEO nanofibers show a synergistic effect among multiple metal cations in spinel structure that enables strong chemical confinement of soluble polysulfides and fast kinetics for polysulfide conversion. Consequently, the S/HEO composite displays the high gravimetric capacity of 1368.7 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C rate, excellent rate capability with the discharge capacity of 632.1 mAh g−1 at 5 C rate, and desirable cycle stability. Furthermore, the S/HEO composite shows desirable sulfur utilization and good cycle stability under a harsh operating condition of high sulfur loading (4.6 mg cm−2) or low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (5 μL mg−1). More impressively, the high volumetric capacity of 2627.9 mAh cm−3 is achieved simultaneously for the S/HEO composite due to the high tap density of 1.92 g cm−3, nearly 2.5 times of the conventional sulfur/carbon composite. Therefore, based on high-entropy oxide materials, this work affords a fresh concept of elevating the gravimetric/volumetric capacities of sulfur cathodes for lithium–sulfur batteries.",Energy and Environmental Materials
Bimetallic Metal-Organic Framework with High-Adsorption Capacity toward Lithium Polysulfides for Lithium–sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Zhengzhou University.The practical application of Li-S batteries is largely impeded by the “shuttle effect” generated at the cathode which results in a short life cycle of the battery. To address this issue, this work discloses a bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF) as a sulfur host material based on Al-MOF, commonly called (Al)MIL-53. To obtain a high-adsorption capacity to lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx, 4 ≤ x ≤ 8), we present an effective strategy to incorporate sulfiphilic metal ion (Cu2+) with high-binding energy to Li2Sx into the framework. Through a one-step hydrothermal method, Cu2+ is homogeneously dispersed in Al-MOF, producing a bimetallic Al/Cu-MOF as advanced cathode material. The macroscopic Li2S4 solution permeation test indicates that the Al/Cu-MOF has better adsorption capacity to lithium polysulfides than monometallic Al-MOF. The sulfur-transfusing process is executed via a melt-diffusion method to obtain the sulfur-containing Al/Cu-MOF (Al/Cu-MOF-S). The assembled Li-S batteries with Al/Cu-MOF-S yield improved cyclic performance, much better than that of monometallic Al-MOF as sulfur host. It is shown that chemical immobilization is an effective method for polysulfide adsorption than physical confinement and the bimetallic Al/Cu-MOF, formed by incorporation of sulfiphilic Cu2+ into porous MOF, will provide a novel and powerful approach for efficient sulfur host materials.",Energy and Environmental Materials
N-doped engineering of a high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode with superior cycling capability for wide temperature lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) is one potential cathode candidate for next-generation high energy-density lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, serious capacity decay from its poor structural stability, especially at high operating temperatures, shadows its application prospects. In this work, N-doped LNMO (LNMON) was synthesized by a facile co-precipitation method and multistep calcination, exhibiting a unique yolk-shell architecture. Concurrently, N dopants are introduced into a LNMO lattice, endowing LNMON with a more stable structure via stronger Ni-N/Mn-N bindings. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the yolk-shell structure and N-doped engineering, the obtained LNMON cathode exhibits an impressive rate and the state-of-the-art cycling capability, delivering a high capacity of 103 mA h g−1 at 25 °C after 8000 cycles. Even at a high operating temperature of 60 °C, the capacity retention remains at 92% after 1000 cycles. The discovery of N dopants in improving the cycling capability of LNMO in our case offers a prospective approach to enable 5 V LNMO cathode materials with excellent cycling capability.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Molecular simulation of glycerol-derived triether podands for lithium ion solvation,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Solvate ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates for several applications due to their stability, high coulombic efficiency, and low volatility. In this work, we investigate the solvation of lithium-bistriflimide by different glycerol-derived triether solvents, using molecular dynamics simulations. Very strong interactions between Li+ and the solvent oxygen sites are found, leading to significant conformational changes in the solvent. By comparing the conformation of the neat solvents with their IL mixtures at different concentrations and temperatures, we find that the presence of Li+ induces a distinct crown-like structure in the solvent molecules. The Li+ cations and the surrounding solvent form a podand complex, which is stable even at elevated temperatures. These glycerol-derived solvents exhibit distinct interactions with Li+ cations which may be exploited in electrolytic applications or lithium recovery processes.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Hollow carbon nanospheres@graphitic C3N5 heterostructures for enhanced oxygen electroreduction,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Improving the electrocatalytic activity of metal-free catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great significance as promising alternatives to the Pt group precious catalysts in fuel cells. This paper proposes a simple template-based strategy to fabricate a catalyst with enhanced ORR activity. The resulting material contained 3D heterojunction and consisted of hollow carbon nanospheres and graphitic C3N5 (HCNs@g-C3N5). The fast electron/charge transports between g-C3N5 and HCNs was achieved because of the conductive heterojunction presence. This heterojunction provided the potential difference, which is beneficial for O2 activation and desorption of the intermediate reaction products. Compared with stand-alone HCNs and g-C3N5, the HCNs@g-C3N5 composite demonstrated significantly enhanced ORR activity with a more positive half-wave potential and faster kinetics in the alkaline medium. Furthermore, linear sweep voltammetry demonstrated that the water generation from O2 occurred through a four-electron transfer reaction. According to calculations performed using density functional theory (DFT), a built-in electronic field (IEF) formed at the heterojunction because of the charge density difference between C and N atoms. This IEF reduced the O2 activation energy and lowered the charge transfer resistance, which, in turn, enabled the rapid formation and desorption of the intermediates and significantly enhanced ORR activity of HCNs@g-C3N5.",Applied Surface Science
Unique Mo2C–CdS–Co@C heterojunction integrated with redox cocatalysts and multiple active sites for efficient photocatalytic H2 generation,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCPhotocatalytic water-splitting has encouraged great interest to obtain renewable H2 fuel via the transformation of solar energy. Although significant progress has been achieved, realizing efficient H2 evolution reaction (HER) with non-noble-metal photocatalysts is still challenging. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of Mo2C–CdS–Co@C heterojunction by anchoring CdS and Mo2C nanoparticles onto Co@C micro-flowers. The Co@C micro-flowers were composed of graphitic carbon nanoflakes partially embedded with Co, CoOx, Co9S8 nanocrystals and obtained through the carbonization of metanilic-anion intercalated Co(OH)2 precursor. Due to excellent visible-light harvesting capacity, efficient charge transmission and isolation caused by the existence of superior electron mediator (graphitic carbon) together with oxidation (CoOx) and reduction (Co, Co9S8, Mo2C) cocatalysts, as well as the plentiful H2-evolving active sites originating from the metal (Co), metal sulfide (Co9S8), and metal carbide (Mo2C), the Mo2C–CdS–Co@C hybrid micro-flowers delivered an exceptional HER (λ > 400 nm) activity of 760.58 μmol h−1 (10 mg), approximately 32 and 15 folds that of pristine CdS and platinum (3 wt%)-decorated CdS, respectively. Moreover, both the cycling and long-term photocatalytic tests confirm that the Mo2C–CdS–Co@C possesses an outstanding durability for H2 production. The study results might inspire the rational integration of cocatalysts to simultaneously optimize the charge trapping and H2-evolving kinetics for strengthening the photocatalytic HER activity efficiently.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
Mesoporous Carbon Materials for Electrochemical Energy Storage and Conversion,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.To meet the high-speed commercialization demands of electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices, the development of high-performance and low-cost electrode materials is urgently necessary. Mesoporous carbon, which shows excellent intrinsic characteristics and flexible structure, has raised a surge of interest recently since it offers opportunities for improving the energy or power density and durability as well as reducing the cost of electrodes. In this paper, we first review primary methods for preparing mesoporous carbons. Next, the obstacles in lithium batteries, supercapacitors, proton exchange membrane fuel cells and water electrolyzers are analyzed and the recent progresses of mesoporous carbon based electrode designs in solving these obstacles are systematically introduced. Finally, we outline current challenges and future directions of developing mesoporous carbon based electrode materials in electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices. In creating this review, we hope to give a succinct introduction to the mesoporous carbon and provide meaningful references for its future research.",ChemElectroChem
A Universal Single-Atom Coating Strategy Based on Tannic Acid Chemistry for Multifunctional Heterogeneous Catalysis,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHHere, we report a universal single-atom coating (SAC) strategy by taking advantage of the rich chemistry of tannic acid (TA). TA units not only self-assemble into a cross-linked porous polyphenolic framework, but also can grip on different substates via multiple binding modes. Benefiting from the diverse chelating ability of TA, a series of mono-, and bi-metallic SACs can be formed on substrates of different materials (e. g., carbon, SiO2, TiO2, MoS2), dimensions (0D–3D) and sizes (50 nm–5 cm). By contrast, uniform SAC cannot be achieved using common approaches such as pyrolysis of metal–dopamine complexes or metal–organic frameworks. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, two Co SACs immobilized on graphene and TiO2 were prepared. The former one shows six-fold higher mass activity than Pt/C toward oxygen reduction. The latter one displays outstanding photocatalytic activity owing to the high activity of the single atoms and the formation of the single-atom coating–TiO2 heterojunction.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Concentrated Electrolyte for High-Performance Ca-Ion Battery Based on Organic Anode and Graphite Cathode,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHDue to the large abundance, low redox potential, and multivalent properties of calcium (Ca), Ca-ion batteries (CIBs) show promising prospects for energy storage applications. However, current research on CIBs faces the challenges of unsatisfactory cycling stability and capacity, mainly restricted by the lack of suitable electrolytes and electrode materials. Herein, we firstly developed a 3.5 m concentrated electrolyte with a calcium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Ca(FSI)2) salt dissolved in carbonate solvents. This electrolyte significantly improved the intercalation capacity for anions in the graphite cathode and contributed to the reversible insertion of Ca2+ in the organic anode. By combining this concentrated electrolyte with the low-cost and environmentally friendly graphite cathode and organic anode, the assembled Ca-based dual-ion battery (Ca-DIB) exhibits 75.4 mAh g−1 specific discharge capacity at 100 mA g−1 and 84.7 % capacity retention over 350 cycles, among the best results known for CIBs.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Hydrothermally Synthesized Sulfur-Doped Graphite as Supercapacitor Electrode Materials,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Sulfur-doped graphite (S-DG) was synthesized using a sustainable method. Low-cost cellulose fiber and carbon disulfide (CS2) were used as precursors for carbon and sulfur (S) sources, respectively, and a multistep chemical and thermochemical synthesis process was employed to obtain S-DG. Advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques and porosimetry analyses were performed to probe the surface morphology, surface area, microstructures, and chemical bonding states of S-DG. Interestingly, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the S loads were 3.81 and 7.02 atom % when reactions were carried out in aqueous and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) media, respectively. The specific surface areas were calculated as 522.77 and 693.27 m2g-1for the two materials, respectively. To our best knowledge, the 7.02 atom % S load is the highest S doping reported so far in a graphite material where laboratory chemicals have been used as precursors. Both materials, i.e., S-DGWaterand S-DGDMSO, were tested as supercapacitor electrodes in a portable electrochemical cell with a three-electrode system to check their potential and stability for the fabrication of renewable energy storage devices. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charging-discharging techniques were performed within a potential window of 1 V in the presence of 1 M Na2SO4as an electrolyte. The maximum specific capacitances (CSp) of S-DGWaterand S-DGDMSOwere obtained as 155.61 and 261.43 F g-1(at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1), respectively. The result concluded that the extent of S doping appeared to be the key factor for control of the peak current. Importantly, our investigation suggests that the S load in graphite facilitates a diffusion-driven storage mechanism and a higher amount of S may enhance surface-controlled storage as well. Both materials show excellent cyclic stability with >98% retention of the initial specific capacitance over 10000 cycles of charging-discharging.",ACS Applied Nano Materials
Engineering Isolated S Vacancies over 2D MoS2Basal Planes for Catalytic Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The consensus has been built on the fact that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of MoS2basal planes can be activated by S vacancies. Currently, the popular strategy for fabricating S vacancies is to remove part of S atoms of MoS2. Owing to the same identity of S atoms, the removal process is usually random and does not have selectivity. Herein, we develop a defect-predesigned strategy to produce MoS2with single-Atomic S vacancies (SV-MoS2) simply by preparing Se-doped MoS2(Se-MoS2) and subsequent removing the Se of Se-MoS2. S vacancies originates from the vaporization of the doped Se atoms, making the formation of S vacancies have a high selectivity and raising a good possibility for precisely modulating the concentration of S vacancies. The results show that the concentration of S vacancies can be controlled over the range from â 7.46% to 13.54%. MoS1.76with â 12.10% of S vacancies exhibits outstanding HER performance: An overpotential of 100 mV at 10 mA cm-2and a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec-1, corroborating the theoretical prediction about the optimum concentration of S vacancies. Density functional theory calculation further reveals that the activation of MoS2basal planes may intrinsically originate from the modification of S vacancies to band structure and density of state of MoS2, optimizing the hydrogen adsorption energy. This defect-predesigned strategy reduces the probability of forming the aggregates of S vacancies and will be more helpful for understanding how S vacancies affect the properties of MoS2",ACS Applied Nano Materials
Alkaliphilic Cu(OH)2 nanowires on copper foam for dendrite-free alkali metal anodes,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The uncontrollable dendritic behavior and volume expansion in alkali metal anodes have led to short-circuit issues and low Coulombic efficiency which significantly hamper the commercialization of alkali metal anodes. To address these issues, we report the fabrication of a novel functional host in which the alkaliphilic Cu(OH)2 nanowires were uniformly grown on Cu foam (denoted as Cu(OH)2-NWs@CF) for Li/Na anodes. The 3D network structure of Cu(OH)2-NWs@CF with high specific surface area can not only effectively reduce local current density to guide homogeneous deposition of Li+, leading to more controllable nucleation sites and dendrite-free Li deposition, but also minimize the volumetric strain during repeated Li/Na stripping/plating processes, mitigating the volume change of the batteries. Benefitting from these advantages, the as-prepared Li/Na@CF composite anodes exhibit outstanding long-term cycle stability and structure maintaining ability. In particular, the Li@CF-based symmetric cells deliver elevated cycling performance under a moderate polarization voltage for nearly 1200 h at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. Similarly, the Na@CF-based symmetric cells can also cycle stably for 800 h at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the Li@CF||LFP full cells show significantly improved rate capability and high cycle stability (97% capacity retention after 100 cycles). Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of the 3D copper foam framework with improved alkaliphilic ability for the development of safe and commercially viable alkali metal anodes.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Herein, we developed a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for Zn-air batteries (ZABs). The Ce-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles embedded on carbon nanofibers complex catalyst (Ce@Co3O4/CNFs) was synthesized via the incorporation of the electrospinning technology and in-situ growth process. The Ce@Co3O4/CNFs exhibited the comparable performance to Pt/C and RuO2 in the alkaline environment with a half-wave potential of 0.810 V and overpotential of 380 mV(@ 10 mA cm−2) for the ORR and OER, respectively. Moreover, an all-solid-state rechargeable ZABs with Ce@Co3O4/CNFs cathode was also assembled, which shows a relatively narrow discharge-charge voltage gap and a good cycle performance. These results provide a novel approach in developing Co-based dual functional electrocatalysts to enable the energy applications.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Lightweight freestanding hollow carbon fiber interlayer for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.As a promising next-generation energy storage device, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have the high theoretical energy densities, however, the notorious “Shuttling Effect” greatly impacts their commercialization. Herein, a freestanding hollow carbon fiber (HCF) derived from waste cotton tissues was designed as an interlayer for Li-S batteries by one-step carbonization at different temperatures. The inherently interwoven fibers and exceptional hollow structure of the carbon interlayers can effectively accelerate the reaction kinetics and restrain the “Shuttling Effect.” Moreover, carbon interlayer can also act as an upper current collector to reutilize the active material, and further enhance the reversible capacities. In this study, the HCF-800 carbon fiber interlayer was fabricated by carbonization at 800°C, which can endow the HCF interlayer with many profitable properties such as rich pore structures, excellent flexibility, and exceptional hollow tube structure. Therefore, the S/super-P with HCF-800 cell was shown the excellent cycling stability with 733 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C after 100 cycles. Even under a high sulfur loading of 2.23 mg cm−2, the cell also maintained a high capacity of 502 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles.",International Journal of Energy Research
Understanding the role of lithium bonds in doped graphene nanoribbons as cathode hosts for Li-S batteries: A first-principles study,"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Using first-principles calculations, we investigate a family of doped graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) for their suitability as cathode hosts in lithium-sulfur batteries. We probe the role played by the lone pairs of the dopants in confining the lithium polysulfides (LiPS) to understand the mechanism of binding. Our results show that the Li bond between the polysulfides and the doped GNRs is analogous to a hydrogen bond and also dipole-dipole interactions play a key role in anchoring the polysulfides. A critical donor-Li-acceptor angle of 180° is found to be essential for proper adsorption of LiPS, highlighting the importance of the directionality of lone pairs. The charge lost by the sulfur atom of the polysulfide upon adsorption and shape of the lone pair basins and the value of Electron Localization Function (ELF) at the dopant position can provide a quick estimate of the strength of the bond. Significant contractions in the ELF profiles are also observed upon Li2S adsorption, further providing evidence for the hydrogen bond-like nature of the Li bond. Our results corroborate the fact that all acceptors capable of forming hydrogen bonds can be employed as suitable dopants for carbon-based cathode hosts in Li-S batteries.",International Journal of Energy Research
Understanding the interactions between lithium polysulfides and anchoring materials in advanced lithium-sulfur batteries using density functional theory,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryLithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promising energy storage devices because of their high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, the “shuttle” effect in lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is an unresolved issue that can hinder their practical commercial application. Research on LSBs has focused on finding appropriate materials that suppress this effect by efficiently anchoring the LiPSs intermediates. Quantum chemical computations are a useful tool for understanding the mechanistic details of chemical interaction involving LiPSs, and they can also offer strategies for the rational design of LiPSs anchoring materials. In this perspective, we highlight computational and theoretical work performed on this topic. This includes elucidating and characterizing the adsorption mechanisms, and the dominant types of interactions, and summarizing the binding energies of LiPSs on anchoring materials. We also give examples and discuss the potential of descriptors and machine learning approaches to predict the adsorption strength and reactivity of materials. We believe that both approaches will become indispensable in modelling future LSBs.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Terphenylthiazole-based self-assembled monolayers on cobalt with high conductance photo-switching ratio for spintronics,© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryTwo new photo-switchable terphenylthiazole molecules are synthesized and self-assembled as monolayers on Au and on ferromagnetic Co electrodes. The electron transport properties probed by conductive atomic force microscopy in ultra-high vacuum reveal a larger conductance of the light-induced closed (c) form than for the open (o) form. We report an unprecedented conductance ratio of up to 380 between the closed and open forms on Co for the molecule with the anchoring group (thiol) on the side of the two N atoms of the thiazole unit. This result is rationalized by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations coupled to the Non-Equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. These calculations show that the high conductance in the closed form is due to a strong electronic coupling between the terphenylthiazole molecules and the Co electrode that manifests by a resonant transmission peak at the Fermi energy of the Co electrode with a large broadening. This behavior is not observed for the same molecules self-assembled on gold electrodes. These high conductance ratios make these Co-based molecular junctions attractive candidates to develop and study switchable molecular spintronic devices.,Nanoscale
Stabilizing Cobalt Single Atoms via Flexible Carbon Membranes as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Binder-Free Zinc-Air Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Single-atom catalysts with high activity and efficient atom utilization have great potential in the electrocatalysis field, especially for rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). However, it is still a serious challenge to rationally construct a single-atom catalyst with satisfactory electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability. Here, we simultaneously realize the atomic-level dispersion of cobalt and the construction of carbon nanotube (CNT)-linked N-doped porous carbon nanofibers (NCFs) via an electrospinning strategy. In this hierarchical structure, the Co-N4sites provide efficient oxygen reduction/evolution electrocatalytic activity, the porous architectures of NCFs guarantee the active site's accessibility, and the interior CNTs enhance the flexibility and mechanical strength of porous fibers.

(FexNi1−x)4N nanoparticles: magnetism and electrocatalytic properties for the oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.γ′-Fe4N has attracted increasing attention in the field of magnetic and electrochemical catalysis due to its high saturation magnetization (208 emu g−1), special metal-like properties, and unique crystal structure, which is similar to that of anti-perovskite. The introduction of another transition metal element, such as Co, Mn, or Ni, to replace the Fe atoms can optimize the magnetic properties, reduce magnetostriction, and enhance the thermal stability of iron nitride materials, as well as improve the electrocatalytic performance. (FexNi1−x)4N nanoparticles (NPs) encased within amorphous carbon were prepared via a simple route that combines a solvothermal method with non-ammonia gas nitriding. The doping of Ni not only has an important effect on the magnetism, but it also enhances the electrocatalytic performance of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The saturation magnetization (Ms) of (Fe0.95Ni0.05)4N NPs increased to 168.15 emu g−1 compared with (Fe1Ni0)4N (142.89 emu g−1). Furthermore, (Fe0.90Ni0.10)4N exhibited the best OER activity, showing an overpotential of 292 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope (29 mV dec−1). These results indicate that the use of Ni-doped γ′-Fe4N can lead to great improvements for magnetic material and electrochemical catalysis applications.",New Journal of Chemistry
Computational screening of functionalized MXenes to catalyze the solid and non-solid conversion reactions in cathodes of lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The poor cycling abilities of S cathodes due to the dissolution of high-order lithium polysulfides and sluggish reaction kinetics of low-order solid Li2S hinder the commercial application of lithium-sulfur batteries. Although many hosts have been introduced into S electrodes to anchor high-order polysulfides, an effective procedure to select the hosts to improve the conversion kinetics of solid Li2S is scarce. Using density functional theory calculations, we proposed a procedure to screen catalytic hosts for solid and non-solid reactions of Li2S2/Li2S by employing the available functionalized Ti3C2T2 MXenes (T = H, O, F, S, Cl, Se, Te, Br, OH, and NH), under the precondition of good anchoring abilities for high-order polysulfides. For the solid-state reactions, it was found that Ti3C2Se2 is the optimal candidate for improving the reaction kinetics of solid Li2S. Suitable catalysts for different reaction processes between molecular Li2S2 and Li2S have also been proposed. We also proposed that sulfur cathodes doped with heavy atoms (Se or Te) belonging to the main group VI may significantly modify the reaction kinetics of Li2S. These results provide guidance on synthesizing MXenes with the given surface groups as the hosts and can accelerate the step of finding out other suitable host materials.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Highly Active and Selective Electroreduction of N2by the Catalysis of Ga Single Atoms Stabilized on Amorphous TiO2Nanofibers,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The electroreduction of N2 under ambient conditions has emerged as one of the most promising technologies in chemistry, since it is a greener way to make NH3 than the traditional Haber-Bosch process. However, it is greatly challenged with a low NH3 yield and faradaic efficiency (FE) because of the lack of highly active and selective catalysts. Inherently, transition (d-block) metals suffer from inferior selectivity due to fierce competition from H2 evolution, while post-transition (p-block) metals exhibit poor activity due to insufficient ""πback-donation""behavior. Considering their distinct yet complementary electronic structures, here we propose a strategy to tackle the activity and selectivity challenge through the atomic dispersion of p-block metal on an all-amorphous transition-metal matrix. To address the activity issue, lotus-root-like amorphous TiO2 nanofibers are synthesized which, different from vacancy-engineered TiO2 nanocrystals reported previously, possess abundant intrinsic oxygen vacancies (VO) together with under-coordinated dangling bonds in nature, resulting in significantly enhanced N2 activation and electron transport capacity. To address the selectivity issue, well-isolated single atoms (SAs) of Ga are successfully synthesized through the confinement effect of VO, resulting in Ga-VO reactive sites with the maximum availability. It is revealed by density functional theory calculations that Ga SAs are favorable for the selective adsorption of N2 at the catalyst surface, while VO can facilitate N2 activation and reduction subsequently. Benefiting from this coupled activity/selectivity design, high NH3 yield (24.47 μg h-1 mg-1) and FE (48.64%) are achieved at an extremely low overpotential of -0.1 V vs RHE.",ACS Nano
Niobium Diboride Nanoparticles Accelerating Polysulfide Conversion and Directing Li2S Nucleation Enabled High Areal Capacity Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The shuttle effect of polysulfides and Li2S sluggish nucleation are the major problems hampering the further development of lithium-sulfur batteries. The reasonable design for sulfur host materials with catalytic function has been an effective strategy for promoting polysulfide conversion. Compared with other types of transition metal compounds, transition metal borides with high conductivity and catalytic capability are more suitable as sulfur host materials. Herein, a niobium diboride (NbB2) nanoparticle with abundant and high-efficiency catalytic sites has been synthesized by facile solid-phase reaction. The NbB2 with both high conductivity and catalytic nature could regulate 3D-nucleation and growth of Li2S, decrease the reaction energy barrier, and accelerate the transformation of polysulfides. Thus, the NbB2 cathode could retain a high capacity of 1014 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles. In addition, the high initial specific capacities of 703/609 mAh g-1 are also achieved at 5 C/10 C and could run for 1000/1300 cycles within a low decay rate of 0.057%/0.051%. Even with a high sulfur loading up to 16.5 mg cm-2, an initial areal capacity of 17 mAh cm-2 could be achieved at 0.1 C. This work demonstrates a successful method for enhancing the kinetics of polysulfide conversion and directing Li2S nucleation.",ACS Nano
"A General Strategy for Engineering Single-Metal Sites on 3D Porous N, P Co-Doped Ti3C2TXMXene","© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Two-dimensional (2D) MXenes have been developed to stabilize single atoms via various methods, such as vacancy reduction and heteroatom-mediated interactions. However, anchoring single atoms on 3D porous MXenes to further increase catalytic active sites and thus construct electrocatalysts with high activity and stability remains unexplored. Here, we reported a general synthetic strategy for engineering single-metal sites on 3D porous N, P codoped Ti3C2TXnanosheets. Through a ""gelation-and-pyrolysis"" process, a series of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (Pt, Ir, Ru, Pd, and Au) supported by N, P codoped Ti3C2TXnanosheets with 3D porous structure can be obtained and serve as efficient catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result of the favorable electronic and geometric structure of N(O), P-coordinated metal atoms optimizing catalytic intermediates adsorption and 3D porous structure exposing the active surface sites and facilitating charge/mass transfer, the as-synthesized Pt SA-PNPM catalyst shows ∼20-fold higher activity than the commercial Pt/C catalyst for electrochemical HER over a wide pH range.",ACS Nano
Delicate Tuning of the Ni/Co Ratio in Bimetal Layered Double Hydroxides for Efficient N2 Electroreduction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHElectroreduction of N2 to NH3 at ambient conditions using renewable electricity is promising, but developing efficient electrocatalysts is still challenging due to the inertness of N≡N bonds. Layer double hydroxides (LDHs) composed of first-row transition metals with empty d-orbitals are theoretically promising for N2 electroreduction (NRR) but rarely reported. Herein, hollow NiCo-LDH nanocages with different Ni/Co ratios were prepared, and their electronic structures and atomic arrangements were critical. The synergetic mechanisms of Ni and Co ions were revealed, and the optimized catalytic sites were proposed. Besides, in-situ Raman spectroscopy and 15N2 isotopic labeling studies were applied to detect reaction intermediates and confirm the origin of NH3. As a result, high NH3 yield of 52.8 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and faradaic efficiency of 11.5 % were obtained at −0.7 V, which are top-ranking among Co/Ni-based NRR electrocatalysts. This work elucidates the structure–activity relationship between LDHs and NRR and is instructive for rational design of LDH-based electrocatalysts.",ChemSusChem

All rights reserved.With the advantages of a high theoretical capacity, proper working voltage, and abundant reserves, silicon (Si) is regarded as a promising anode for lithium-ion batteries. However, huge volume expansion and low electronic conductivity impede the commercialization of Si anodes. We devised a one-step, vacuum-assisted reactive carbon coating technique to controllably produce micrometer-sized nanoporous silicon confined by homogeneous N-doped carbon nanosheet frameworks (NPSi@NCNFs), achieved by the solid state reaction of a commercial bulk precursor and the subsequent evaporation of byproducts. The graphitization degree, C and N contents of the carbon shell, as well as the porosity of Si can be regulated by adjusting the synthetic conditions. A rational structure can mitigate volume expansion to maintain structural integrity, enhance electronic conductivity to facilitate charge transport, and serve as a protected layer to stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase. The NPSi@NCNF anode enables a stable cycling performance with 95.68% capacity retention for 4000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Furthermore, a flexible 2D/3D architecture is designed by conjugating NPSi@NCNFs with MXene. Lithiophilic NPSi@NCNFs homogenize Li nucleation and growth, evidenced by structural evolutions of MXene@NPSi@NCNF deposited Li. The application potential of NPSi@NCNFs and MXene@NPSi@NCNFs is estimated via assembling full cells with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cathodes.

Exfoliation of Al-Residual Multilayer MXene Using Tetramethylammonium Bases for Conductive Film Applications,"Copyright © 2022 Saita, Iwata, Shibata, Matsunaga, Suizu, Awaga, Hirotani and Omachi.This study describes the concise exfoliation of multilayer Ti3C2Tx MXene containing residual aluminum atoms. Treatment with tetramethylammonium base in a co-solvent of tetrahydrofuran and H2O produced single-layer Ti3C2Tx, which was confirmed via atomic force microscopy observations, with an electrical conductivity 100+ times that of Ti3C2Tx prepared under previously reported conditions. The scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the exfoliated single-layer Ti3C2Tx MXenes were reconstructed to assembled large-domain layered films, enabling excellent macroscale electric conductivity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the complete removal of residual Al atoms and the replacement of surface fluorine atoms with hydroxy groups.

Synergetic design of N-doped defect-enriched porous carbon matrix with Co-Co0.85Se loading for water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing robust and efficient non noble catalysts for water splitting is needed in the energy storage and application field. Constructing electronic structures to enhance the catalytic activity is always interesting and meaningful. Herein, electronic structures are simply synthesized through a rational design of Co-Co0.85Se heterostructures anchoring on the defective N-doped carbon matrix. Co anchoring on the defective N-doped carbon matrix is obtained from hydrothermal-carbonization process of pectin, melamine and cobalt chloride. Rational design of partial selenization can construct electronic structures to form Co-Co0.85Se heterostructures anchoring on the defective N-doped carbon matrix (Co-Co0.85Se-CN). The introduction of Co atoms induces the electron cloud redistribution of Co0.85Se, enhancing the electrocatalytic activity for water splitting. The defective N-doped carbon matrix provides plenty of catalytic sites and good conductivity for ions transition. Co-Co0.85Se-CN exhibits outstanding catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The Operando Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the dual active centers of Co and Se atom, facilitating the catalytic process for water splitting. DFT calculation results reveal that the constructed electronic structures from Co and Co0.85Se-CN is good for the H* adsorption for HER.

Terminal sulfur atoms formation via defect engineering strategy to promote the conversion of lithium polysulfides,"© 2021The defect engineering shows great potential in boosting the conversion of lithium polysulfides intermediates for high energy density lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs), yet the catalytic mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, the oxygen-defective Li4Ti5O12-x hollow microspheres uniformly encapsulated by N-doped carbon layer (OD-LTO@NC) is delicately designed as an intrinsically polar inorganic sulfur host for the research on the catalytic mechanism. Theoretical simulations have demonstrated that the existence of oxygen deficiencies enhances the adsorption capability of spinel Li4Ti5O12 towards soluble lithium polysulfides. Some -S-S- bonds of the Li2S6 on the defective Li4Ti5O12 surface are fractured by the strong adsorption force, which allows the inert bridging sulfur atoms to be converted into the susceptible terminal sulfur atoms, and reduces the activation energy of the polysulfide conversion in some degree. In addition, with the N-doped carbon layer, secondary hollow microspheres architecture built with primary ultrathin nanosheets provide a large amount of void space and active sites for sulfur storage, adsorption and conversion. The as-designed sulfur host exhibits a remarkable rate capability of 547 mAh g−1 at 4 C (1 C=1675 mA g−1) and an outstanding long-term cyclability (519 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 3 C). Besides, a high specific capacity of 832 mAh g−1 is delivered even after 100 cycles under a high sulfur mass loading of 3.2 mg cm−2, indicating its superior electrochemical performances. This work not only provides a strong proof for the application of oxygen defect in the adsorption and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides, but offers a promising avenue to achieve high performance LSBs with the material design concept of incorporating oxygen-deficient spinel structure with hierarchical hollow frameworks.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology

Complex 1 contains tetra-nuclear Cu clusters, which are linked by Mo8 anions to form a 1D chain. Both complexes 2 and 3 are 0D structures, and complex 3 includes tri-nuclear Cu clusters. Rarely observed [Mo12O38]4− subunits are present in complex 4, which are further linked by {MoO4} to construct a new infinite Mo-O chain.

Short-range order in amorphous nickel oxide nanosheets enables selective and efficient electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production,"© 2022 The Author(s)Achieving high selectivity and activity with the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is significant for developing efficient energy conversion techniques and chemical production. Here, we report that selective ORRs can be achieved by tuning short-range order in amorphous and crystalline NiO nanosheets (a-NiO NSs and c-NiO NSs, respectively). X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis reveals that the short-range order of a-NiO NSs and c-NiO NSs mainly adopt the NiO5 pyramidal and NiO6 octahedral structures, respectively. The a-NiO NSs for electrochemical H2O2 production in 0.1 M KOH exhibits both high selectivity over 90% and high activity (1 mA cm−2 at 0.66 V versus RHE), while c-NiO NSs tends to catalyze ORRs through 4-electron pathways to generate H2O. Theoretical calculations indicate that the changed short-range order of a-NiO NSs leads to alteration of Ni d-orbital states, which can regulate the adsorption orientation and strength of ∗OOH intermediates to achieve high selectivity and activity of 2-electron ORRs.",Cell Reports Physical Science

"Review of modification strategies in emerging inorganic solid-state electrolytes for lithium, sodium, and potassium batteries","© 2022The design of solid-state electrolyte (SSE) entails controlling not only its bulk structure but also the internal (e.g., grain boundary and pore) and heterophase (e.g., anode-SSE reaction layer) interfaces. Moreover, defects are integral for establishing both the initial all-solid-state battery (ASSB) cell performance and its ultimate cycling lifetime. This topical review discusses 5 highly promising inorganic lithium-, sodium-, and potassium-based SSEs, providing case studies of strategies to enhance ionic conductivity, tune the internal and heterophase interfaces, and prevent dendrites and deleterious side reactions. The primary focus is on garnet LLZO (Li7La3Zr2O12), argyrodite (Li6AS5X, A = P, Sb and X = Cl, Br, I), Na3AB4 (A = P, Sb, As and B = S, Se), and NASICON-type electrolytes, with several exploratory potassium systems being presented as well. The article begins with a discussion of the superionic conduction mechanisms, which is assisted by defects, topology, correlation, and disorder. The discussion then shifts to the thermodynamic or kinetic phase stability of metastable SSEs, followed by the SSE internal interfaces (pores and grain boundaries), and finally the complex microstructure associated with the reactive boundaries between the SSE and the metal anode and the SSE and the high-voltage ceramic cathode. This review explores why SSE systems with highly promising bulk ionic conductivity values do not demonstrate comparable performance in full cells. A major cause is the cycling-induced formation of ionically insulating but electrically conducting new phases at both the anode and the cathode. For the SSEs that do not rapidly decompose when contacting the anode, site-specific variations in ionic conductivity/electrical resistivity lead to growth of metal dendrites. In each electrolyte class, creative fabrication strategies have been employed to minimize, but not fully eliminate, new phase formation and dendrites, creating ample opportunities for additional analytical and synthesis-focused research. The emphasis of the discussion is on the bulk doping strategies for SSEs, emerging simulation and characterization findings in relation to SSE performance and cell failure, and new synthesis approaches and cell architectures to improve cycling stability. Throughout the article, outstanding scientific questions are identified, and future research directions are proposed.",Joule
"Effects of adatom species on the structure, stability, and work function of adatom-α-borophene nanocomposites","© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Work function-tunable borophene-based electrode materials are of significant importance because they promote efficient carrier extraction/injection, thereby enabling electronic devices to achieve maximum energy conversion efficiency. Accordingly, determining the work function of adatom-borophene nanocomposites within a series wherein the adatom is systematically changed will facilitate the design of such materials. In this study, we theoretically determined that the M-B bond length, binding energy, electron transfer between adatoms and BBP, and work function (ϕ) are linearly dependent on the ionization potential (IP) and electronegativity for thermodynamically and kinetically stable adatom-α-borophene (M/BBP) systems involving a series of alkali (earth) metal/BBP (M = Li-Cs; Be-Ba) and halogen/BBP (M = F-I), respectively. However, the binding energies of Li/BBP and Be/BBP deviate from these dependencies owing to their super small adatoms and the resulting significantly enhanced effective M-B bonding areas. By interpreting the electron transfer picture among the different parts of M/BBP, we confirmed that metallic M/BBP possesses ionic sp-p and dsp-p M-B bonds in alkali (earth) metal/BBP but covalent-featured ionic p-p interactions in halogen/BBP. In particular, the direct proportionality between IP and ϕ for alkali (earth) metal/BBP originates from the synergistic effect of charge rearrangement and the increased induced dipole moment; however, the inverse proportionality between electronegativity and ϕ for halogen/BBP arises from the adsorption induced charge redistribution. Our results provide guidance for experimental efforts toward the realization of work function-tunable borophene-based electrodes as well as insight into the bonding rules between various adatoms and α-borophene.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Two-step pyrolysis of Mn MIL-100 MOF into MnO nanoclusters/carbon and the effect of N-doping,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.MIL-100 is a class of trimesate MOFs that have been widely studied as candidates for various energy related applications. Understanding a MOF's pyrolysis is important as it determines the different functional materials derived from it. The chemistry and pyrolysis process of Mn MIL-100 are closely examined in this work. A two-step pyrolysis in inert gas is discovered and the products at each step are verified, as well as the phase transition and morphology evolution. The critical conditions to obtain air-stable MnO nanoclusters from this MOF are also identified. In addition, N-doping into this N-free MOF is realized through reacting with dicyandiamide. The effect of N-doping and the correlation between the amount of N doped and the final pyrolysis product are revealed. Through this mechanistic study, a precise control of the nanoscale morphology and composition of the pyrolysis product becomes possible.

Mineral composite materials and their energy storage and energy catalysis applications 矿物复合材料及其能量存储与能源催化应用,"© 2022, Science Press. All right reserved.Mineral composite material is a cross-field of mineralogy and composite material that has emerged in recent years. These materials have specific functional properties of minerals and the unique characteristics of composite materials. Energy-related materials are currently a research hotspot. However, a systematic review of energy storage and energy catalysis in composite materials from natural minerals is few. Mineral composite materials have the following advantages. (1) Minerals are natural composite materials conducive to ecological civilization construction. (2) Mineral resources are abundant on the Earth, which means pronounced cost reduction in composite materials. (3) Mineral-derived tailings wastes can be comprehensively turned into treasure. This study presents the advances in energy storage and catalysis applications of composite materials from a mineral composite perspective. First, we discussed this discipline's evolution, the development process, and classified mineral composite materials. Second, we introduced the applications of mineral composites in the field of energy storage, such as piezoelectric self-power generation, supercapacitors, and secondary batteries. Finally, we summarized the applications of mineral composites in the domain of energy catalysis, including electrocatalysis, energy photocatalysis, and pyroelectric/piezoelectric catalysis. The regulation of mineral functions or auxiliary units can significantly improve energy storage and catalytic activities. Specifically, the mineral loading/recombination strategy for photocatalytic applications helps inhibit the recombination of photo-generated carriers and enhance their light absorption. Stripping the mineral ore and forming a composite material for energy electrocatalysis are beneficial in exposing its active catalytic sites and reducing the activation energy required for hydrogen evolution reaction applications. Mineral composite materials have evolved from mechanical functional mineral composite materials to multi-functional mineral composite materials. However, numerous problems remain on the path to scientific research and industrialization, such as batch preparation and mineral composites' stability. We conclude that strengthening the practical design of multi-functional mineral composites enables us to understand the mechanism of mineral composite materials by combing crystal structure design, physical and chemical characterizations, and theoretical calculation/simulation. Further, we presented future scientific challenges and development opportunities for mineral composite materials.",Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin

Hierarchical multi-channels conductive framework constructed with rGO modified natural biochar for high sulfur areal loading self-supporting cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 The Author(s)The insulation of sulfur and Li2S/Li2S2 (discharge products) and the “shuttle” of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) seriously limit the research of high specific capacity lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high sulfur loading. Inspired by the natural architecture of pomelo peels, we report a self-supporting carbon framework (SCF) modified by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as conductive skeleton and sulfur carrier for the cathode of rechargeable Li-S batteries. The high initial capacity (1489.65 mA h g−1) of SCF@rGO/S binder-free cathode with the high sulfur areal loading (∼5.50 mg cm−2) arise from the improved batteries conductivity by the interconnecting conductive skeleton. The SCF@rGO with hierarchical porous structure, abundant microchannels and oxygenic functional groups can effectively physical limit/intercept and chemical adsorption/anchor LiPSs, thereby improving the utilization of active sulfur and promoting the reuse. Sufficient active sites in SCF@rGO/S provide close electrical contact to accelerate electrons and ions transfer, resulting in high electrochemical activity and redox kinetics. Consequently, the SCF@rGO/S cathode exhibits an outstanding capacity retention (569.66 mA h g−1) and cycle stability at 1 C for over 200 long-term cycles with a decline of only 0.13% per cycle. Even at 2 C, the capacity is still up to 645.59 mA h g−1.

The Co9S8@HN/S-C catalyst exhibits an abundant porous structure (pore volume ≈ 0.46 cm3 g−1) and high specific surface area (485 m2 g−1). Benefiting from the active Co9S8 species and N/S co-doped hierarchical porous carbon (HN/S-C), the Co9S8@HN/S-C exhibits excellent ORR properties in alkaline solution. The half-wave potential (E1/2) and an onset potential are 0.91 V and 1.01 V (vs. RHE), respectively, which outperforms most previously reported non-precious metal catalysts. In addition, the assembled MFC with Co9S8@HN/S-C as cathode catalyst also exhibits excellent electrical performance and stability, with the maximum output power density of 1436.5 mW m−2 and a stable output voltage of 0.59 V, which is better than the most recently reported MFC cathode materials, such as Co9S8/NHCS (704 mW m−2, 0.5 V) and Co/Co9S8/NPG (1156 mW m−2, 0.562 V), etc. More notably, the outstanding chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate can reach 80%, and the coulomb efficiency of Co9S8@HN/S-C based MFC is also better than that of commercial Pt/C. This universal method can be widely used to prepare high-performance electrocatalysts for MFC in wastewater treatment and recovery of electricity.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
"Lithiated 3, 6-dioxa-1, 8-octane dithiol as redox mediator to manipulate polysulfides conversion for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Limited by sluggish sulfur redox kinetics of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, polysulfides conversion heavily depends on the surface of conductive substrate, which will result in electrode passivation and accumulation of dead sulfur. Here, the lithiated 3, 6-dioxa-1, 8-octane dithiol (DODL) is proposed as a redox mediator to promote the bidirectional polysulfides transformation in actual operation. DODL generated by lithiation reaction has weaker acidity and is friendly to the lithium anode. During discharging, DODL can chemically reduce long-chain polysulfides, lessening the dependence of polysulfide conversion on conductive substrate and mediate 3D deposition of Li2S. Moreover, acceleration of sulfur redox kinetics can reduce the possibility of side reactions between polysulfides and lithium anode. During charging, the addition of DODL is found to decrease the voltage barrier of Li2S to polysulfides, enhancing the reversibility of sulfur redox. In particular, S8 can dissolve in the electrolyte with DODL, which can alleviate the irreversible accumulation of dead Li2S according to comproprtionation reaction. Attributing to these properties, the Li-S cells with DODL display excellent stability of long cycles at 0.5 C, 1 C and 2 C. Under the harsh environment of low electrolyte/sulfur ratio and high sulfur loading, the cells with DODL also perform well.

Platinum (Pt) is the most promising catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) so far, but the high cost and agglomeration of Pt nanostructures brought it limitations. Herein, we report an electrocatalyst with surface-engineered Pt nanoclusters with relatively low content (0.96 wt%) supported on a two-dimensional (2D) MXene substrate (Ti2CTx, Tx represents surface functional groups) and Pt3Ti alloy interfaces formed after annealing at 900 °C. Pt/Ti2CTx-900 exhibits superior HER activity (achieving 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 1.7 mV) and excellent stability under continuous tests. Therefore, this easy-to-operate strategy develops a superior low-cost electrocatalyst for HER, paving the way for future development of other highly active and robust functional composite materials.",Materials Letters
Multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst as peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate activator for water purification: A critical review,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and peroxydisulfate (PDS) (or collectively known as persulfate, PS) using carbocatalyst is increasingly gaining attention as a promising technology for sustainable recalcitrant pollutant removal in water. Single heteroatom doping using either N, S, B or P is widely used to enhance the performance of the carbocatalyst for PS activation. However, the performance enhancement from single heteroatom doping is limited by the type of heteroatom used. To further enhance the performance of the carbocatalyst beyond the limit of single heteroatom doping, multi-heteroatom doping can be conducted. This review aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview on the development of multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst for PS activation. The potential synergistic and antagonistic interactions of various heteroatoms including N and B, N and S, N and P, and N and halogen for PS activation are evaluated. Thereafter, the preparation strategies to develop multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst including one-step and multi-step preparation approaches along with the characterization techniques are discussed. Evidence and summary of the performance of multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst for various recalcitrant pollutants removal via PS activation are also provided. Finally, the prospects of employing multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst including the need to study the correlation between different heteroatom combination, surface moiety type, and amount of dopant with the PS activation mechanism, identifying the best heteroatom combination, improving the durability of the carbocatalyst, evaluating the feasibility for full-scale application, developing low-cost multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst, and assessing the environmental impact are also briefly discussed.",Journal of Hazardous Materials
Ultra-fast synthesis of iron decorated multiwalled carbon nanotube composite materials: A sensitive electrochemical sensor for determining dopamine,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Real-time monitoring of dopamine (DA) levels, a critical neurotransmitter involved in motor function and blood pressure regulation, requires more sensitive and selective sensors over a dynamic concentration range. The immense need to build highly efficient catalysts has always been at the forefront of electrochemical detection research toward DA. Herein, we design and synthesis an iron carbides-based heterostructure composite (Fe/Fe3C@CNT) by the introduction of microwave-assisted method and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Remarkably, it took only about 1.5 min to completely the preparation process including the pyrolysis of ferrocene (iron sources) and the formation of Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the CNTs. Due to the unique heterostructure, enhanced electrical conductivity and adequate dispersion of active sites, the fabricated sensors exhibit favorable selectivity and great sensing property, yielding a distinguishable and selective response to DA down to 15 nM with a good linearity scope of 0.050–40 μM. The developed Fe/Fe3C@CNT electrode was then successfully applied to monitor the DA level from the real samples, which holds considerable promise for electrochemical detection and biosensing applications.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
InOOH as an efficient bidirectional catalyst for accelerated polysulfides conversion to enable high-performance lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries with the prominent advantages are greatly expected to be the attractive alternatives in the next-generation energy-storage systems. However, the practical success of Li–S batteries suffers from the shuttle effect and depressed redox kinetics of polysulfides. Herein, for the first time, InOOH nanoparticles are employed as a potent catalytic additive in sulfur electrode to overcome these issues. As demonstrated by the theoretical and experimental results, the strong interactions between the InOOH nanoparticles and sulfur species enable the effective adsorption of polysulfides. More significantly, InOOH nanoparticles not only effectively expedite the reduction of sulfur during the discharge process, but also dramatically accelerate the oxidation of Li2S during the charge process, presenting the marvelous bidirectional catalytic effects. Benefited from these distinctive superiorities, the cells with InOOH nanoparticles harvest an excellent capacity retention of 69.5% over 500 cycles at 2C and a commendable discharge capacity of 891 mAh g−1 under a high-sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm−2. The detailed investigations in this work provide a novel insight to ameliorate the Li–S electrochemistry by the bidirectional catalyst for high-performance Li–S batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
ZIF-8 derived porous carbon to mitigate shuttle effect for high performance aqueous zinc–iodine batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Rechargeable aqueous zinc–iodine batteries (ZIBs) with low environmental impacts and abundant natural reserves have emerged as promising electrochemical energy storage devices. However, the shuttle effect and low conductivity of the iodine species cause poor electrochemical performance and hinder their practical application. Herein, we propose a ZIF-8 derived porous carbon (ZPC) for iodine species immobilization in ZIBs. The rich porous structure and highly conductive framework of ZPC provide efficient iodine loading and allow the fast transmission of electrons. In addition, the presence of N, Zn and ZnO in the carbon framework can build chemical anchoring with the iodine species to mitigate the shuttle effect. Thus, the ZPC/I2 cathode exhibits a reversible capacity of 156 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and a long-term stability of 1000 cycles at a high rate. This study will open a new paradigm for devolving highly reversible ZIBs.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
"Porous biomass-derived carbon modified by Cu, N co-doping and Cu nanoparticles as high-efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction and zinc-air battery","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Exploration of new non-precious metal catalysts for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for sustainable energy utilization technologies. Herein, porous biomass-derived carbon modified by Cu, N co-doping and Cu nanoparticles was synthesized by hydrothermal followed pyrolysis strategy, and used for electrocatalytic ORR. The optimized Cu/Cu-N-C catalyst exhibits large surface area (235.91 cm3 g−1) and hierarchical pore structure. Benefiting from the above factors, the Cu/Cu-N-C catalyst performs a high onset potential (Eonset, 0.947 V vs. reversible hydrogen potential (RHE)) and a half-wave potential (E1/2, 0.875 V vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH solution. The calculated electron transfer number of 3.92 suggests the near-four-electron ORR process. Besides, the Cu/Cu-N-C catalyst also performs extraordinary stability and higher methanol tolerance than Pt/C. In addition, the assembled Zn-air battery based on the optimized Cu/Cu-N-C catalyst exhibits a higher power density of 150.7 mW cm−2 than the that of Pt/C-based battery.

In-situ construction of g-C3N4/carbon heterostructure on graphene nanosheet: An efficient polysulfide barrier for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been considered as the future potential energy storage system with advantages of high energy density (2600 Wh kg−1), eco-friendliness and low cost. However, the poor conductivity and serious shuttle effects of polysulfides block their application. Herein, g-C3N4/carbon heterostructure on graphene nanosheet (PCNG) is constructed via phenyl-modified strategy and in-situ thermal polycondensation, which has a unique electron cloud distribution with excellent sulfur immobilization ability as well as good electroconductivity. As a result, Li-S cells with simple S/C cathodes and PCNG interlayers show a high initial capacity of 1192 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, and an ultra-long lifespan with a slow capacity attenuation of 0.050% per cycle after 800 cycles. The cell with PCNG/PP separator also has a stable cycle performance at high area sulfur loading of 7 mg cm−2. These findings provide a new sight on functionalizing g-C3N4 for application in Li-S electrochemistry.",Applied Surface Science
Understanding the activity origin of oxygen-doped carbon materials in catalyzing the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction towards hydrogen peroxide generation,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Oxygen-doped carbon materials (OCM) have received a lot of attention for catalyzing the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2eORR) towards hydrogen peroxide generation, but the origin of their activity is not well understood. Based on density functional theory calculations, we introduce the Fukui function (f0), a more comprehensive and accurate method for identifying active sites and systematically investigating the activity of carbon materials doped with typical oxygen functional groups (OGs). According to the results, only ether or carbonyl has the potential to become the activity origin. The 2eORR activities of carbon materials co-doped by different OGs were then investigated, and a significant synergistic effect was discovered between different OGs (particularly between epoxy and other OGs), which might be the real active centers in OCM. To further understand the cause of the activity, the Fundamental Gap (Eg) was introduced to investigate the ability of various OCM to gain and lose electrons. The results show that the decrease in overpotential after oxygen co-doping can be attributed to the decrease in Eg. This work introduces descriptors (f0 and Eg) that can aid in the efficient design of catalysts and adds to our understanding of the 2eORR activity origin of OCM.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Double shelled hollow CoS2@MoS2@NiS2 polyhedron as advanced trifunctional electrocatalyst for zinc-air battery and self-powered overall water splitting,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Electrocatalysts play important role in various energy conversion and storage devices. The catalytic performance of electrocatalysts can be enhanced through the increasement of intrinsic catalytic activity by optimizing electronic structure and the improvement of exposed active sites by designing proper nanostructures. In this work, CoS2@MoS2@NiS2 nano polyhedron with double-shelled structure was prepared using metal organic framework as a precursor. Due to the rational integration of multifunctional active center, the strong electronic interaction of the various component, the high electrochemical surface area and shortened mass transport induced by the special structure, CoS2@MoS2@NiS2 exhibits high catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, low overpotentials of 156 and 200 mV was achieved to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for HER and OER, and a high half-wave potential of 0.80 V was observed for ORR. More importantly, the Zn-air battery assembled by CoS2@MoS2@NiS2 exhibits a high-power density of 80.28 mW cm−2 and could effectively drive overall water splitting.

An individual sandwich hybrid nanostructure of cobalt disulfide in-situ grown on N doped carbon layer wrapped on multi-walled carbon nanotubes for high-efficiency lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2021Binding and trapping of lithium polysulfide (LPS) are being conceived as the most effective strategies to improve lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery performance. Therefore, exploiting a simple but cost-effective approach for the absorption and conversion of LPS and the transfer of electrons and Li+ ions is of paramount importance. Herein, sandwich structure MWCNTs@N-doped-C@CoS2 integrated with multiple nanostructures of zero-dimensional (0D) CoS2 nanoparticles, 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and 2D N-doped amorphous carbon layer was obtained, where MWCNTs was firstly uniformly attached with a polydopamine (PDA) of excellent adhesion, followed by hydrothermal method, the Co2+ nanoparticles were in-situ grown on the PDA by the formation of complex compound of Co2+ and N atoms in PDA, and then the CoS2 nanoparticles were in-situ grown on CNTs in a point-surface contact way by a bridging of N-doped amorphous carbon layer derived from the carbonization of attached PDA after the vulcanization at 500 °C under Ar atmosphere. The multifunction synergism of absorption, conductivity, and the kinetics of LPS redox is significantly improved, consequently effectively suppressing the shuttle effect and tremendously increasing the utilization rate of active substance. For the Li-S battery assembled with MWCNTs@N-doped-C@CoS2-modified separator, its rate capacity and cycling performance can be greatly enhanced. It can exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 1590 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, a stable long-term cycling performance with a relatively low capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle during 500 cycles at 1 C, and a reversible capacity of 772 mAh g−1 and a capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle during 250 cycles at 2 C. Even at a large current density of 4 C, an initial specific discharge capacity of 634 mAh g−1 can still be delivered. With a high sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm−2, additionally, an outstanding cycling stability can also be well maintained at 685 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C after 50 cycles. This work provides a novel and simple but effective strategy to develop such sandwich hybrid materials comprised of polar metal sulfides and conductive networks via an effective bridging to help realize durable and stable Li-S battery.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Here, a versatile kinetics-regulated cooperative polymerization induced interfacial selective superassembly strategy is demonstrated to construct a series of asymmetric hollow porous composites (AHPCs) with tunable diameters, architectures and components. The size and number of patches on Janus nanoparticles can be precisely manipulated by the precursor and catalyst content. Notably, AHPCs exhibit excellent photothermal conversion performance under the irradiation of a near infrared (NIR) laser.

p–d Orbital Hybridization Induced by a Monodispersed Ga Site on a Pt3Mn Nanocatalyst Boosts Ethanol Electrooxidation,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHConstructing monodispersed metal sites in heterocatalysis is an efficient strategy to boost their catalytic performance. Herein, a new strategy using monodispersed metal sites to tailor Pt-based nanocatalysts is addressed by engineering unconventional p–d orbital hybridization. Thus, monodispersed Ga on Pt3Mn nanocrystals (Ga-O-Pt3Mn) with high-indexed facets was constructed for the first time to drive ethanol electrooxidation reaction (EOR). Strikingly, the Ga-O-Pt3Mn nanocatalyst shows an enhanced EOR performance with achieving 8.41 times of specific activity than that of Pt/C. The electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results and theoretical calculations disclose that the Ga-O-Pt3Mn nanocatalyst featuring an unconventional p–d orbital hybridization not only promote the C−C bond-breaking and rapid oxidation of -OH of ethanol, but also inhibit the generation of poisonous CO intermediate species.

MgCo layered double hydroxide-based yolk shell polyhedrons as multifunctional sulfur mediator for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.The development of efficient sulfur host materials to address the shuttle effect issues of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is crucial in the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries but still challenging. In the present study, a novel yolk shell structured MgCo-LDH/ZIF-67 composite is designed as Li-S battery cathode. In this composite, the shell layer is MgCo layered double hydroxide constructed by partially etching ZIF-67 nanoparticle by Mg2+, and the core is the unreacted ZIF-67 particle. The unique yolk shell structure not only provides abundant pores for sulfur accommodation, but also facilitates the electrolyte penetration and ion transport. The ZIF-67 core exhibits strong polar adsorption to LiPSs through the Lewis acid-base interactions, and the micropores/mesoporous can further trap LiPSs. Meanwhile, the MgCo-LDH shell exposes enough sulfur-philic sites for enhancing chemisorption and catalyzes LiPSs conversion. As a result, when MgCo-LDH/ZIF-67 is used as sulfur host in the cathode, the cell achieves a high discharge capacity of 1121 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, and an areal capacity of 5.0 mAh cm-2 under high sulfur loading of 5.8 mg cm-2. The S/MgCo-LDH/ZIF-67 electrode holds a promising potential for the development of Li-S batteries.",Nanotechnology
Combined enhanced redox kinetics and physiochemical confinement in three-dimensionally ordered macro/mesoporous TiN for highly stable lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with tremendous energy density possess great promise for the next-generation energy storage devices. Even though, the shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) seriously restrict practical applications of Li-S batteries. Herein, a three-dimensionally ordered macro/mesoporous TiN (3DOM TiN) nanostructure is established via using poly (methyl methacrylate) PMMA spheres as template. The interconnected macro/mesoporous channels are constructed to effectively alleviate the stacking of composite materials and render a large portion of inherent active sites exposed on the surface region. Moreover, TiN exhibits high electrical conductivity, which efficiently enhances charge-transfer kinetics and guarantees the favorable electrochemical performance of sulfur cathode. More importantly, the as-prepared 3DOM TiN suppresses the shuttle effect and improves the redox kinetics significantly due to strong affinity toward LiPSs. Attributed to these unique features, the S/3DOM TiN electrode achieves an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 1187 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, and stable cycling performance of 552 mAh g-1 over 500 cycles at 1 C. Meanwhile, the discharge capacity retention of 701 mAh g-1 (3.5 mAh cm-2) can be endowed for the S/3DOM TiN electrode under high sulfur loading of 5 mg cm-2 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. Therefore, the 3DOM TiN nanostructure electrocatalyst provides a promising path for developing practically useable Li-S batteries.",Nanotechnology
"Highly Crystalline, Free-Standing Covalent Organic Framework Films Produced Directly from Monomer Solutions","Not subject to U.S. Copyright. Published 2022 by American Chemical Society.Films made from covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising materials for a variety of applications, such as membranes for chemical separation, mechanically robust engineering materials, and components of energy storage devices. However, current techniques for synthesizing imine-based COF films use methods that are difficult to scale, produce films of only nanometer-scale thickness, or yield films with modest surface areas and low crystallinity. Here, a facile, scalable process for casting free-standing, imine-based COF films tens of microns in thickness directly from a solution of monomers in trifluoroacetic acid and water is reported for the first time. Highly crystalline films with surface areas (2200-2400 m2/g) approaching the theoretical maximum could be achieved by controlling the initial film formation conditions and by heating the produced films in ethanol with a small amount of residual acid.",ACS Applied Polymer Materials
Rationally integrated nickel sulfides for lithium storage: S/N co-doped carbon encapsulated NiS/Cu2S with greatly enhanced kinetic property and structural stability,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Nickel sulfides are promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high theoretical capacities but suffer from a sluggish kinetic process and poor structural stability. Herein, we develop a rationally integrated strategy for the construction of a S/N co-doped carbon-coated NiS/Cu2S composite (NiS/Cu2S@N/S-C) via a convenient one-step calcination process. Copper can be formed in situ during the lithiation process of the conversion reaction after combining nano-scale nickel sulfide with proper cuprous sulfide, which is conducive to increasing the conductivity, promoting the reversible conversion of the discharge product Li2S, and suppressing the dissolution of polysulfides, leading to the superior kinetic property and structural stability of the electrode. Notably, the S/N co-doped carbon coating with polar C-S or C-N bonds not only enhances the transfer of electrons and ions but also inhibits coarsening, agglomeration of particles and dissolution of polysulfides during lithiation. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that heterogeneous atomic doping of N and S can enhance the adsorption behavior of carbon sheets to NiS, Cu2S and intermediate discharge products in LIBs, further demonstrating an improvement of lithium storage capability and cycling stability due to the S/N co-doped carbon coating. As a result, NiS/Cu2S@N/S-C possesses a considerable rate capacity of 511.7 mA h g−1 at 3 A g−1, and an outstanding stable capacity of 771.7 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 with a high retention rate of 98% after 1800 cycles. NiS/Cu2S@N/S-C shows remarkable comprehensive performance when compared with most reported nickel sulfide anode materials. This strategy predigests the tedious process of sulfurization and carbon encapsulation and would be of great significance to design nickel sulfide anodes with excellent lithium storage performance.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers

Remarkable Effect of Fe and Se Composition on Magnetic Properties─Comparative Study of the Fe-Se System at the Nanoscale,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Herein, for the first time, the correlation between the phase structure and the magnetic properties of the Fe-Se system has been presented for FexSey compounds─where x/y ranges from 1:2 to 1:1. These phases─orthorhombic (FeSe2), monoclinic (Fe3Se4), hexagonal (Fe7Se8), and tetragonal (β-FeSe)─were synthesized using a one-pot thermal decomposition route at the nanoscale. The magnetic properties vary enormously with change in the Fe/Se ratio due to the change in the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio, crystal field environment around the Fe ions, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, Fe vacancies, and so forth. Among the four Fe-Se phases studied, two of them, Fe3Se4 and Fe7Se8, are ferrimagnetic below ∼300 K and show semihard magnetic properties. The other two phases FeSe2 and β-FeSe exhibiting weaker magnetism are less known for their magnetic properties. All these phases are prone to surface oxidation despite surface passivation, and its effect on the magnetic moment will be pronounced for the phases with weak magnetization such as FeSe2 and β-FeSe.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C

This hybrid structure exhibited a large surface-to-volume ratio with fast electron and ion transport. The electrical conductivity of GaZnON nanowire was revealed by Hall Effect measurements. The GaZnON nanowire anode delivered a high capacity of 878.2 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 200 cycles, increased by 144% relative to a GaZnON powder anode. After 2000 cycles at 2.0 A g−1, the discharge capacity was maintained at 326.6 mA h g−1. The nanowire-based morphology was demonstrated as the origin of the fast charge transfer kinetic and improved pseudocapacitive. The ex-situ XRD and XPS measurements demonstrated the structural stability and reversible lithium-ion intercalation mechanism of GaZnON nanowire.

Co-embedded nitrogen-enriching biomass-derived porous carbon for highly efficient oxygen reduction and flexible zinc-air battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The configurations of nitrogen species have a crucial influence on the transition metal-nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts (M-N-C). Whereas, how to build more sp2 hybrid N (including pyridinic and graphitic N) to enhance the catalytic activity and charge transfer rate of the carbon-based ORR catalysts remains a challenge. Herein, Co-embedded nitrogen-enriching platanus bark-derived porous carbon (PBPC) material (Co-N-C) was developed from the pyrolytic platanus bark, assisted by impregnating cobalt salt and ethylenediamine nitriding strategy. The synthesized catalyst exhibits a high nitrogen content of 5.02%, of which over 2/3 are high conductivity sp2 hybrid N (consist of pyridinic and graphite-N), suggesting the unity of high activity and conductivity. Thus, it delivers a competitive half wave potential and a lower Tafel slope (69.55 mV dec−1) than Pt-C-20% catalyst. The ZAB with Co-N-C-900 catalyst exhibits a higher open-circuit potential and a peak power density up to 3.5 times (186.17 mW cm−2) higher than that of the Pt-C-20%. During the durability test for 100 cycles (16.7 h), the voltage gap only increased by 4.2%, nevertheless, the Pt-C-20%-based ZAB encountered a catastrophic polarization surge in less than 16 h. When assembling a flexible ZAB, it performs excellent flexibility in bending tests, and the voltage gap merely increased by 1.7% after 100 cycles (16.7 h).",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Ultrafast Kinetics in a PAN/MgFe2O4 Flexible Free-Standing Anode Induced by Heterojunction and Oxygen Vacancies,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyFlexibility and power density are key factors restricting the development of flexible lithium-ion batteries (FLIBs). Interface and defect engineering can modify the intrinsic ion/electron kinetics by regulating the electronic structure. Herein, a polyacrylonitrile/MgFe2O4 (PAN-MFO) electrode with heterojunction and oxygen vacancies was first designed and synthesized as a flexible free-standing anode of FLIBs by electrostatic spinning technology. The PAN carbon nanofiber (PAN-CNF) as the skeleton structure provides fast conductive channels, buffers the volume expansion, and enhances the cycle stability. The heterostructure constructs the internal electric field, facilitates the Li+/charge transfer, intensifies the Li+ adsorption energy, and enhances the interfacial lithium storage. Oxygen vacancies improve the intrinsic conductivity, lower the Li+ diffusion barrier, weaken the Fe-O bonding, and facilitate the conversion reaction. Because of the synergistic effect of the multifunctional structure, the PAN-MFO shows superior cycle and rate performance with ultrafast kinetics. Flexible LiCoO2/PAN-MFO full pouch cells were also assembled that demonstrated a stable cycle performance and power supply in both the plain and bent states.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Low-Temperature Synthesis of Lithium Lanthanum Titanate/Carbon Nanowires for Fast-Charging Li-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyDue to the lower working voltage and higher capacity, the Li-rich lithium lanthanum titanate perovskite (LLTO) anode is becoming a potential candidate for the commercial Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) Li-ion battery anode [Zhang, L. Lithium Lanthanum Titanate Perovskite as an Anode for Lithium Ion Batteries. Nat. Commun. 2020, 11, 3490]. However, a high temperature of 1250 °C is required to fabricate pure LLTO particles by the conventional solid-phase calcination method, limiting their further practical applications. Here, an in situ carbon nanospace confined method is developed to synthesize the pure LLTO with sub-nanometer grain size at an extremely low temperature of 800 °C. The LLTO precursor is confined in the in situ formed carbon nanowire matrix during heating, resulting in a shorter solid-phase diffusion distance and subsequently lower energy required for the formation of the pure LLTO phase. The low-temperature-synthesized pure LLTO/carbon composite nanowires (P-LLTO/C NWs) exhibit improved lithium storage performances than the traditionally prepared LLTO due to the fast electronic conduction of carbon and the stable carbon surface. In addition, the working potentials of P-LLTO/C||LiFePO4 and P-LLTO/C||LiCoO2 full cells are all 0.7 V higher than that of the corresponding commercial full cells with LTO as an anode, meaning much higher power energy densities (307.6 W kg-1 at 2C and 342.4 W kg-1 at 1C vs 198.4 W kg-1 and 275.2 W kg-1 for LTO||LiFePO4 and LTO||LiCoO2 full cells based on electrode materials, respectively). This low-temperature synthesis method can extend to other solid-state ionic materials and electrode materials for electrochemical devices.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Nitrogen and sulfur co-doping strategy to trigger the peroxidase-like and electrochemical activity of Ti3C2 nanosheets for sensitive uric acid detection,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of functional nanomaterials based on the unique structure and morphology of MXene for biosensing has aroused great interest. In this work, using thiourea as the doping source, a new structure composed of nitrogen and sulfur co-doped on the surface of Ti3C2 nanosheets was synthesized through a simple one-step synthesis method. Fortunately, the obtained nitrogen and sulfur co-doped Ti3C2 nanosheets (NS–Ti3C2 NSs) showed excellent peroxidase-like activity and electrochemical activity. The catalytic mechanism of modified Ti3C2 nanosheets was explored. It is revealed that the catalytic mechanism of NS-Ti3C2 NSs is composed of two important parts: the dissociation and adsorption of H2O2 and the protonation of TMB. In addition, the fabricated NS-Ti3C2 NSs-based electrochemical biosensor is superior to the counterpart from Ti3C2 nanosheets, indicating that the doping of nitrogen and sulfur elements provides more active sites and promotes electron transport efficiency. Combining the unique advantages of colorimetry and electrochemical technology, we have developed a fast, accurate, intuitive and efficient UA detection method for uric acid in the range of 2 μM–400 μM with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.19 μM. The established sensing platform in this study prove the possibility of the doping method for the development of MXene-based biosensors with high sensitivity and high performance, and pave the way for the future development of biosensors for biomedical fields.",Analytica Chimica Acta
Monodispersed copper phosphide nanocrystals in situ grown in a nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide matrix and their superior performance as the anode for lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.A nanocomposite anode material consisting fully of monodispersed copper phosphide (Cu3P) nanocrystals in situ grown in three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-RGO) matrices has been manufactured via a “heating-up” synthesis, which involves nucleation, nitrogen-doping, crystallization and ligand exchange. The “heating-up” synthesis approach, using stable and relatively low-toxicity precursors and 3D porous N-RGO as the matrix, is straightforward, cost-effective and up-scalable. The Cu3P nanocrystals with an average size of 25-40 nm are wrapped, without aggregation, within the interior and on the surface of the curling N-RGO matrices. The resultant Cu3P/N-RGO nanocomposites possess a 3D porous nanostructure with a BET surface area as high as 405.71 m2 g−1. In this nanostructure, the N-RGO's properties of excellent conductivity and an interconnected porous network enable the Cu3P/N-RGO nanocomposites to provide pathways for rapid electron transfer and lithium ion transport, and the Cu3P nanocrystals with their small size and monodispersed phase can accommodate the volume change during charging/discharging processes. Hence, Cu3P/N-RGO nanocomposites reveal an excellent lithium-storage performance in terms of a long-life cycling stability (705.5 mA h g−1 at 10C, 88.8% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 25 °C), a high heat-resistance capability (674.6 mA h g−1 under 10C, 88.9% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 55 °C), and a high rate capability (604.6 mA h g−1 at 50C).",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers
Efficient ambient ammonia synthesis by Lewis acid pair over cobalt single atom catalyst with suppressed proton reduction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Improving the ammonia yield and Faraday efficiency of ambient electrochemical nitrogen fixation is a priority for altering the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. In this work, positively charged single cobalt atoms anchored on sponge-like nitrogen-doped mesoporous interconnected hollow carbon nanofibers (serving as a Lewis acid pair) were intentionally designed as catalytic centers that can suppress the side effect of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction and simultaneously boost the electrochemical conversion of nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3). The Lewis acid pair catalyst exhibits an NH3 production rate of 67.6 μg h−1 mg−1 and a maximum Faraday efficiency of 56.9% at a peak potential of −0.1 V vs. RHE, which outperforms previously reported nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) catalysts. First-principles DFT calculations suggest the regulation of the local electronic structure that induces Lewis acid pair formation upon charge transfer between the single Co atom and substrate, confirming a high intrinsic NRR by both experiments and theoretical calculations.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
NbN nanodot decorated N-doped graphene as a multifunctional interlayer for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The scalable applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are seriously hampered by the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the safety concern related to lithium dendrites. Herein, we report a lithiophilic and sulfiphilic NbN decorated nitrogen-doped graphene (NbN@NG) interlayer on a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator. Due to the lithiophilic features of NbN nanodots effectively hindering the growth of lithium dendrites, the Li//Li symmetric battery with NbN@NG/PP delivers outstanding stability at 5 mA h cm−2 over 1100 h. Owing to the polar and conductive NbN nanodots with strong interaction and high catalytic conversion towards LiPSs suppressing the shuttling effect, the Li-S battery with NbN@NG/PP delivers a high discharge capacity of 1284 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and excellent high-rate performance at 2C with a negligible capacity fading of 0.036% per cycle over 500 cycles. The Li-S pouch battery with NbN@NG/PP delivers a capacity of 847 mA h g−1 with a low electrolyte volume/sulfur loading ratio of 6 μL mg−1. Theoretical density functional theory and in situ Raman spectroscopy effectively demonstrate the mechanism for LiPSs conversion. This work provides a new design strategy for multifunctional separators and new insights into the performance-enhancement mechanism towards high-performance shuttle-free and dendrite-free Li-S batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Unveiling the advantages of an ultrathin N-doped carbon shell on self-supported tungsten phosphide nanowire arrays for the hydrogen evolution reaction experimentally and theoretically,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryPackaging electrocatalysts with carbon shells offers an opportunity to develop stable and effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) materials. Here, an ultrathin N-doped carbon-coated self-supported WP nanowire array (WP@NC NA) hybrid has been synthesized. Owing to the encapsulation of the ultrathin N-doped carbon shell on the WP surface, the as-prepared WP@NC NA hybrid exhibits enhanced physicochemical stability, more active sites, and superior conductivity compared with WP NA without carbon coating. Besides, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the carbon shell can optimize the hydrogen adsorption step in the acidic HER, and simultaneously facilitate water physical adsorption, water dissociation, and hydroxyl group desorption steps during the alkaline HER. These findings demonstrate the intrinsic mechanism of how a carbon shell promotes the acidic and alkaline HER kinetics, and provide scientific guidance for the packaging design of promising carbon-encapsulating self-supported electrocatalysts.",Nanoscale

"State of the art advancement in rational design of g-C3N4 photocatalyst for efficient solar fuel transformation, environmental decontamination and future perspectives","© 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCRecently, the graphite based heterogeneous photocatalysts has attained tremendous research attention in various environmental applications. Among them, the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is categorized as a unique solar active particle with its outstanding intrinsic properties i.e., adequate band configuration, excellent light absorptivity and thermo-physical durability, which make it highly useful and reliable for revenue transformation and ecological concerns. Considering the intrinsic potential of g-C3N4 in photocatalysis, so far, no report has been done in literature for its extraordinary configuration, morphological characteristics and perspective tuning for said applications. To overcome this research gap, our primary emphasis of this review regarding photocatalysis is to provide layout as well as the advancement of visible-light-fueled materials as highly stabilized and extremely effective ones for pragmatic implementation. Thus, this existing comprehensive assessment conducts a systematic survey over visible light driven non-metal novel g-C3N4. The major advancement of this evaluation is the fabrication of well-designed nanosized g-C3N4 photocatalysts with unique configurable frameworks and compositions. Furthermore, alternative techniques in order to customize the analogue band configuration and noticeable cultivation such as metal (cation), nonmetal (anion) doping, worthy metal activating, and alloy initiation with certain semiconductors are discussed in detail. In addition to this, g-C3N4 photocatalytic functionalities towards photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, CO2 photoreduction, biological metal ions deterioration as well as bacterial sanitization are also presented and discussed in detail. Therefore, we believe that such a pivotal compact assessment can provide a roadmap in several perspectives on the currently underway obstacles in the innovation of effective g-C3N4 catalytic design processes. Moreover, this critical assessment will ultimately serve as a useful supplement in the research area of g-C3N4 nanosized photocatalysts and for the researchers working on its key aspects in diverse range of natural, chemistry, engineering and environmental applications.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
Z-scheme MoO3-2D SnS nanosheets heterojunction assisted g-C3N4 composite for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolutions,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCIn this work, the 2D SnS/g-C3N4 nanosheets have been successfully prepared by a facile ultrasonic and microwave heating approach, which formed intimate interfacial contact and suitable energy band structure. The optimized sample displayed enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water assisted with Pt co-catalyst, which is much higher than that of pure g-C3N4.

Carbon encapsulated bimetallic FeCo nanoalloys for one-step hydroxylation of benzene to phenol,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Carbon encapsulated iron catalysts hold great potential for one-step hydroxylation of benzene to phenol due to their unique core-shell nanostructures. However, their catalytic performance is moderate, since the carbon shells have impeded their activity toward H2O2 activation. Herein, we demonstrate that alloying engineering of Fe cores with Co atoms is a promising strategy to address the issue about H2O2 activation. The incorporation of Co into Fe cores can generate strong synergetic effects to promote H2O2 activation, while still maintaining the structural benefits of carbon shells for benzene hydroxylation reaction. As a result, the phenol yield obtained on carbon encapsulated FeCo (FeCo@C) reaches to 26.4 ± 0.7% with a selectivity of 96.2 ± 1.2%, much higher than that of Fe@C and Co@C. With the improved intrinsic catalytic behavior toward H2O2 activation and well-reserved carbon structure benefits, FeCo@C should be a promising catalyst for a broad liquid-phase reactions using H2O2 as the oxidant.",Applied Catalysis A: General

The physic-chemical properties of catalyst samples were characterized by multiple techniques, such as SEM, XRD, FTIR, XPS and BET. The results showed that: (1) Cu-BTC prepared at different reaction times maintained its unique hexagonal prism crystal structure. As the reaction time increased, the purity and specific surface area of Cu-BTC gradually increased, up to 1521.320 m2/g. (2) Cu-BTC-30 h catalyst had a high Oα/(Oα+Oß) ratio and could act as an electron acceptor to react with NO. The surface of the catalyst contained two valence state (Cu2+ and Cu+), and Cu2+ was dominant. (3) As the preparation time of the catalyst increased, the denitration also increased.

Low-temperature Li-S battery enabled by CoFe bimetallic catalysts,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered promising energy storage devices. To ensure practical applications in a natural environment, Li-S batteries must be capable of performing normally at low temperature. However, the intrinsic characteristics of S, such as large volume variation, low conductivity, and shuttle effect, hinder its low-temperature applications. Moreover, Li+ transport is poor at low temperatures, resulting in fast capacity deterioration, low-capacity output, and large overpotential. In this study, a free-standing host embedded with CoFe bimetallic nanoparticles has been designed. CoFe functions as an efficient catalyst for the polysulfide conversion. The in situ growth of graphite shells around CoFe bimetallic nanoparticles function as a nanoreactor to confine and absorb polysulfides, and the host is an ideal porous conductivity network for rapid ion transportation, preventing the accumulation of Li2S and alleviating the volume changes during the lithiation/delithiation process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove that the successive lithiation process from S8 to Li2S on CoFe is thermodynamically spontaneous, and CoFe has a kinetic catalytic activity for this series of lithiation reactions. Experimentally, rationally designed CoFe@C@CNF cathodes are introduced into Li-S batteries for low-temperature applications. The cathode delivers superior rate capacity (828 mA h g−1 at 10C) and a low fading rate (0.053% per cycle over 300 cycles). An enhanced capacity (836 mA h g−1 at 0.2C) and cycling stability (capacity retention rate of 94.5% after 100 cycles) were achieved at −20 °C. This study provides a feasible method for developing high-rate and long-life Li-S batteries for low-temperature applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Effect of the sulfur termination on the properties of Hf2CO2 MXene,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.A computational study was carried out to investigate the effect of surface termination on Janus Hf2COS MXene by substituting partly the O-terminated layer with S atoms. Our predictions confirm that this chemical strategy allows one to tailor the band gap of MXenes. Indeed, the semiconducting character of Hf2CO2 MXene decreases by the exchange of O by S atoms. From a structural point of view, dynamical, mechanical, and thermal analysis confirm the thermodynamic stability of the Janus Hf2COS MXene, which shows metallic character. Furthermore, topological chemical analysis indicates an ionic nature of Hf2CO2 MXene that tends to be reduced by increasing the concentration of S atoms, promoting a covalent character. Shortly, the present study illustrates how the properties of MXenes can be tailored by functionalizing them with different chemical terminations.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Ultrasensitive Immunosensor for Prostate-Specific Antigen Based on Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence by Vertically Ordered Mesoporous Silica-Nanochannel Film,"Copyright © 2022 Ma, Zheng, An and Liu.Ultrasensitive and specific detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in complex biological samples is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment of prostate-related diseases. Immunoassay with a simple sensing interface and ultrahigh sensitivity is highly desirable. Herein, a novel electroluminescence (ECL) immunosensing platform is demonstrated based on the equipment of vertically ordered mesoporous silica-nanochannel films (VMSFs) with PSA antibody, which is able to realize ultrasensitive detection of PSA in human serum. Through the electrochemically assisted self-assembly (EASA) method, the VMSF is easily grown on an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode in a few seconds. Owing to a large surface area and the negatively charged surface, VMSF nanochannels display strong electrostatic attraction to the positively charged ECL luminophores (tris(2,2-bipyridyl) dichlororuthenium (II), (Ru(bpy)32+), leading to two orders-of-magnitude enhancement of ECL emission compared with that of the bare ITO electrode. The outer surface of the VMSF is functionalized with reactive epoxy groups, which further allows covalent attachment of PSA antibody (Ab) on the entry of nanochannels. As the combination of PSA with Ab decreases the ECL signal by hindering the mass transfer of ECL luminophores and coreactant, the developed immunosensor can achieve ultrasensitive detection of PSA ranging from 1 pg ml−1 to 100 ng ml−1 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1 pg ml−1. Considering the antifouling ability of the VMSF, sensitive detection of PSA in human serum is also realized. The proposed nanochannel-based immunosensor may open up a new way for the facile development of the universal immunosensing platform for rapid and ultrasensitive detection of disease markers.",Frontiers in Chemistry
High-density sulfonic acid-grafted covalent organic frameworks with efficient anhydrous proton conduction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryCovalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted much attention in the field of high-temperature anhydrous proton conduction due to their high specific surface area and ordered one-dimensional nanochannels. Herein, a high density sulfonic acid (-SO3H) functionalized proton conducting COF (TB-COF) was designed and synthesized via anchoring of sulfonic acid groups on the pore walls as a proton source. To the best of our knowledge, the synthesized TB-COF presents the highest intrinsic proton conductivity (1.52 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 120 °C) reported, due to the presence of high density -SO3H groups on the ordered 1D nanochannels. Further incorporation of a protic ionic liquid (PIL), 1-methyl-3-(3-sulfopropyl) imidazolium hydrogensulphate ([PSMIm][HSO4]), into the TB-COF greatly improved its proton conductivity to 2.21 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 120 °C. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations proved the directional migration of protons along the stacked nanochannels of the COFs with the assistance of O atoms on the keto groups. This work provides innovative structural design ideas and performance improvement methods for COFs as proton conducting materials.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Natural wood-derived free-standing films as efficient and stable separators for high-performance lithium ion batteries,"© 2022 The Author(s).A sustainable and low-cost separator is highly required for electrochemical energy storage systems. Herein, a type of modified natural wood film with excellent mechanical properties, ion conductivity and thermal stability is fabricated for high-performance lithium ion batteries. Using the modified natural wood film as a separator, the fabricated symmetric cell exhibits a more stable and lower plating/stripping voltage for Li than that of the cell with a commercialized polypropylene (PP) separator. The LiFePO4/Li half-cell with the modified wood film separator shows a small polarization voltage and high discharge capacity because of the multi-level nanostructure and abundant functional groups of the modified wood films. The results suggest that the modified wood films are a promising candidate for use as separators in lithium ion batteries. As desired, the LiFePO4/Li half-cells with the modified wood film separator deliver much higher discharge capacities and more stable Coulomb efficiency over two hundred charge/discharge cycles than the cell based on the PP separator. The present work systematically investigate the feasibility of abundant and cheap natural wood-derived materials for use as efficient separators instead of synthetic polymers for high-performance lithium ion batteries with long cycle life.",Nanoscale Advances
Photoactive nanomaterials enabled integrated photo-rechargeable batteries,"© 2022 Cristina Rodríguez-Seco et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.The research interest in energy storage systems (e.g. batteries and capacitors) has been increasing over the last years. The rising need for electricity storage and overcoming the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources have been potent drivers of this increase. Solar energy is the most abundant renewable energy source. Thus, the combination of photovoltaic devices with energy storing systems has been pursued as a novel approach in applications such as electric vehicles and smart grids. Among all the possible configurations, the ""direct""incorporation of photoactive materials in the storing devices is most attractive because it will enhance efficiency and reduce volume/weight compared to conventional systems comprised two individual devices.

Oxygen-Terminated Nb2CO2 MXene with Interfacial Self-Assembled COF as a Bifunctional Catalyst for Durable Zinc-Air Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyThe desirable air cathode in Zn-air batteries (ZABs) that can effectively balance oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions not only needs to adjust the electronic structure of the catalyst but also needs a unique physical structure to cope with the complex gas-liquid environment. In this work, first-principles calculations were carried out to prove that oxygen-terminated Nb2CO2 MXene played an active role in enhancing the sluggish reaction of oxygen intermediates. Nb2CO2 MXene could also stimulate the spatial accumulation of discharge products, which was beneficial to improve the stability of secondary ZABs. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to show that the confinement effect of COF could effectively regulate the concentration of O2 on the surface of Nb2CO2@COF, which was conducive to an efficient and durable reaction. COF-LZU1 was self-assembled on the interface of Nb2CO2 MXene (Nb2CO2@COF) for the first time. The Nb2CO2@COF electrode had excellent OER/ORR overpotentials with the potential difference (ΔE) of 0.79 V. When applied to the configuration of ZABs, Nb2CO2@COF showed a power density of 75 mW cm-2 and favorable long-term charge/discharge stability, so it could be used as a potential candidate cathode for noble-metal-based catalysts. This idea of combining MXenes and COFs sheds some light on the design of ZABs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Superimposed Effect of La Doping and Structural Engineering to Achieve Oxygen-Deficient TiNb2O7 for Ultrafast Li-Ion Storage,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyTiNb2O7 (TNO) is a competitive candidate of a fast-charging anode due to its high specific capacity. However, the insulator nature seriously hinders its rate performance. Herein, the La3+-doped mesoporous TiNb2O7 materials (La-M-TNO) were first synthesized via a facile one-step solvothermal method with the assistance of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). The synergic effect of La3+ doping and the mesoporous structure enables a dual improvement on the electronic conductivity and ionic diffusion coefficient, which delivers an impressive specific capacity of 213 mAh g-1 at 30 C. The capacity retention (@30C/@1C) increases from 33 to 53 and 74% for TNO, M-TNO, and La-M-TNO (0.03), respectively, demonstrating a step-by-step improvement of rate performance by making porous structures and intrinsic conductivity enhancement. DFT calculations verify that the enhancement in electronic conductivity due to La3+ doping and oxygen vacancy, which induce localized energy levels via slight hybridization of O 2p, Ti 3d, and Nb 4d orbits. Meanwhile, the GITT result indicates that PVP-induced self-assembly of TNO accelerates the lithium ion diffusion rate by shortening the Li+ diffusion path. This work verifies the effectiveness of the porous structure and highlights the significance of electronic conductivity to rate performance, especially at >30C. It provides a general approach to low-conductivity electrode materials for fast Li-ion storage.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Elucidating Synergistic Mechanisms of Adsorption and Electrocatalysis of Polysulfides on Double-Transition Metal MXenes for Na-S Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Multiple unfavorable features, such as poor electronic conductivity of sulfur cathodes, the dissolution and shuttling of sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn) in electrolytes, and the slower kinetics for the decomposition of solid Na2S, make sodium-sulfur batteries (NaSBs) impractical. To overcome these obstacles, novel double-transition metal (DTM) MXenes, Mo2TiC2T2, (T = O and S) are studied as an anchoring material (AM) to immobilize higher-order polysulfides and to expedite the otherwise slower kinetics of insoluble short-chain polysulfides. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are carried out to justify and compare the effectiveness of Mo2TiC2S2and Mo2TiC2O2as AMs by analyzing their interactions with S8/Na2Sn(n = 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8). Mo2TiC2S2provides moderate adsorption strength compared to Mo2TiC2O2, therefore, it is expected to effectively inhibit Na2Sndissolution and shuttling without causing decomposition of Na2Sn. The calculated Gibbs free energies of the rate-determining step for sulfur reduction reactions (SRR) are found to be significantly lower (0.791 eV for S and 0.628 eV for O functionalization) than that in vacuum (1.442 eV), suggesting that the SRR is more thermodynamically favorable on Mo2TiC2T2during discharge. Additionally, both Mo2TiC2S2and Mo2TiC2O2demonstrated effective electrocatalytic activity for the decomposition of Na2S, with a substantial reduction in the energy barrier to 1.59 eV for Mo2TiC2S2and 1.67 eV for Mo2TiC2O2. While Mo2TiC2O2had superior binding properties, structural distortion is observed in Na2Sn, which may adversely affect cyclability. On the other hand, because of its moderate binding energy, enhanced electronic conductivity, and significantly faster oxidative decomposition kinetics of polysulfides, Mo2TiC2S2can be considered as an effective AM for suppressing the shuttle effect and improving the performance of NaSBs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Complex Metal Borohydrides: From Laboratory Oddities to Prime Candidates in Energy Storage Applications,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Despite being the lightest element in the periodic table, hydrogen poses many risks regarding its production, storage, and transport, but it is also the one element promising pollution-free energy for the planet, energy reliability, and sustainability. Development of such novel materials conveying a hydrogen source face stringent scrutiny from both a scientific and a safety point of view: They are required to have a high hydrogen wt.% storage capacity, must store hydrogen in a safe manner (i.e., by chemically binding it), and should exhibit controlled, and preferably rapid, absorption-desorption kinetics. Even the most advanced composites today face the difficult task of overcoming the harsh re-hydrogenation conditions (elevated temperature, high hydrogen pressure). Traditionally, the most utilized materials have been RMH (reactive metal hydrides) and complex metal borohydrides M(BH4)x (M: Main group or transition metal; x: Valence of M), often along with metal amides or various additives serving as catalysts (Pd2+, Ti4+ etc.). Through destabilization (kinetic or thermodynamic), M(BH4)x can effectively lower their dehydrogenation enthalpy, providing for a faster reaction occurring at a lower temperature onset.

Herein, ultrafine platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) supported on N,S-codoped porous carbon nanofibers (Pt-N,S-pCNFs) hybrids were prepared through the electrospinning method coupled with hydrothermal and carbonation processes. The ultrafine Pt NPs are sufficiently dispersed and loaded on pCNFs and codoped with N and S, which can improve oxygen adsorption, afford more active sites, and greatly enhance electron mobility. The Pt-N,S-pCNFs hybrid achieves excellent activity and stability for ORR with ∼70 mV positive shift of onset potential compared to the commercial Pt/C-20 wt% electrocatalyst. The long-term catalytic durability with 89.5% current retention after a 10 000 s test indicates its remarkable ORR behavior. Pt-N,S-pCNFs also exhibits excellent HER and OER performance, and can be used as an efficient catalyst for water splitting. In addition, Pt-N,S-pCNFs exhibits an excellent hydrogen storage capacity of 0.76 wt% at 20 °C and 10 MPa. This work provides novel design strategies for the development of multifunctional materials as high-performance ORR catalysts, water splitting electrocatalysts and hydrogen storage materials.",Nanoscale Advances
Metal–organic framework-derived phosphide nanomaterials for electrochemical applications,"© 2022 The Authors. Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Because of features, such as adjustable structures, high porosity, and high crystallinity, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) deservedly have received considerable attention. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvements in the electrical conductivity and chemical stability of some MOFs, because of which they cannot be utilized as electrode materials. Fortunately, MOF derivatives have received widespread attention in recent years, especially phosphide materials, which are widely used in practical applications because of their outstanding conductivity, excellent specific surface area, and standout charge mobility.

NiS1−xSex Nanoparticles Anchored on Nitrogen-Doped Reduced Graphene Oxide as Highly Stable Anode for Sodium-Ion Battery,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Nickel sulfides are regarded as one of the promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but the sluggish electrodes kinetics and rapid capacity decay, caused by their intrinsic low electrical conductivity and high bulk expansion, greatly limit their practical application. To overcome these obstacles, nano-sized, selenium-doped, nickel sulfide particles, anchored on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide composites (NiS1−xSex@N–rGO), are rationally synthesized. The broad Na+ diffusion channels, resulting from Se doping, as well as the short Na+ transferring path, attributed from nano-size scale of NiS1−xSex particles, endow NiS1−xSex@N–rGO composites with ultrafast storage kinetics. Moreover, strong coupled effect between the NiS1−xSex and N–rGO is beneficial to the uniform dispersion of NiS1−xSex nanoparticles, improving electrical conductivity and suppressing the volume variation in charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the cut-off discharge voltage is modulated to realize the smaller volume change during cycle process. As a result, the fabricated anode of SIBs based on NiS1−xSex@N–rGO composites exhibits a high specific capacity of 300 mAh g−1, at the current density of 1 A g−1, after 1000 cycles with almost no capacity degradation.",Processes
Synthesis of a graphitized hierarchical porous carbon material supported with a transition metal for electrochemical conversion,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryCarbon materials supported with metals with high graphitization and a hierarchical pore structure are emerging as promising catalysts in the electrochemical conversion area. However, the development of a facile method to prepare this class of catalysts remains challenge. In the present work, Ni species decorated carbon materials with high graphitization and a hierarchical pore structure have been prepared by a simple one-pot synthesis strategy. During the carbonization process, Ni atoms can catalyze the activation reaction between CO2 and the carbon skeleton and further facilitate the formation of mesopores without affecting graphitization, which give rise to carbon materials with a foam-like nanostructure. A direct positive correlation is observed between the amount of Ni atoms and the mesopore size. The as-synthesized carbon material decorated with metal species with high graphitization and a hierarchical porous structure can serve as a promising electrocatalyst. This work might provide a path for the design and construction of metal decorated graphitized hierarchical porous carbon materials, which may show potential application in the electrochemical conversion field.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers
Pyrolyzing soft template-containing poly(ionic liquid) into hierarchical N-doped porous carbon for electroreduction of carbon dioxide,"© 2021 The Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China, and Chemical Industry Press Co., Ltd.Heteroatom-doped carbon materials have demonstrated great potential in the electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR) due to their versatile structure and function. However, rational structure control remains one challenge. In this work, we reported a unique carbon precursor of soft template-containing porous poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) that was directly synthesized via free-radical self-polymerization of ionic liquid monomer in a soft template route. Variation of the carbonization temperature in a direct pyrolysis process without any additive yielded a series of carbon materials with facile adjustable textural properties and N species. Significantly, the integration of soft-template in the PIL precursor led to the formation of hierarchical porous carbon material with a higher surface area and larger pore size than that from the template-free precursor. In CO2RR to CO, the champion catalyst gave a Faraday efficiency of 83.0% and a current density of 1.79 mA∙cm−2 at −0.9 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). The abundant graphite N species and hierarchical pore structure, especially the unique hierarchical small-/ultra-micropores were revealed to enable better CO2RR performance.",Chinese Journal of Chemical Engineering
Photosensitive Ti3C2 for dyes degradation,"© 2021 The AuthorsIn this study, a unique 0-D/2-D Ti3C2 structure was assembled by salt-etching Ti3C2 nanodots out of their parent 2-D Ti3C2 nanosheets. The strong quantum confinement in finite-sized nanodots and concomitant nanodents endowed this structure with a gradient bandgap. UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum revealed the bandgap energies of the coated nanodots and inner nanosheets were 2.82 and 2.40 eV, respectively. Accordingly, the 0-D/2-D Ti3C2 was fairly sensitive to sunlight and could efficiently degrade MB, MeB and RhB dyes in contaminated water under solar illumination. Photocatalytic experiments evidenced that less dye adsorption would induce higher removal ratio of the dye. Moreover, cyclic removal experiments showed the photodegradation efficiency of 0-D/2-D Ti3C2 could still exceed 60% after the fifth cycle for MB, MeB and RhB dyes.",Results in Materials

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Exploring bifunctional electrocatalysts to lower the activation energy barriers for sluggish electrochemical reactions for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are of great importance in achieving lower energy consumption and higher conversion efficiency for future energy conversion and storage system. Despite the excellent performance of precious metal-based electrocatalysts for OER and ORR, their high cost and scarcity hamper their large-scale industrial application. As alternatives to precious metal-based electrocatalysts, the development of earth-abundant and efficient catalysts with excellent electrocatalytic performance in both the OER and the ORR is urgently required. Herein, we report a core–shell CoFeS2 @CoS2 heterostructure entangled with carbon nanotubes as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the OER and the ORR. The CoFeS2 @CoS2 nanocubes entangled with carbon nanotubes show superior electrochemical performance for both the OER and the ORR: a potential of 1.5 V (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the OER in alkaline medium and an onset potential of 0.976 V for the ORR. This work suggests a processing methodology for the development of the core–shell heterostructures with enhanced bifunctional performance for both the OER and the ORR.",Nanomaterials
Review-Oxygen Electrocatalysts based on Various Modulation Strategies for Rechargeable Li-O2Batteries,"© 2022 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS"").Li-O2 batteries as one of the rechargeable energy storage devices have aroused considerable interests due to the pleasant energy density. However, the development and application of Li-O2 batteries are still restricted by several challenging issues, including high overpotential, poor cycling life, and low round-trip efficiency, due to the sluggish electrochemical kinetic integrating oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR, OER) in the cathode. Therefore, rationally developing innovatively bifunctional electrocatalysts is critical to alleviate the above problems.

Boron Oxide Enhancing Stability of MoS2 Anode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is the most well-known transition metal chalcogenide for lithium storage applications because of its simple preparation process, superior optical, physical, and electrical properties, and high stability. However, recent research has shown that bare MoS2 nanosheet (NS) can be reformed to the bulk structure, and sulfur atoms can be dissolved in electrolytes or form polymeric structures, thereby preventing lithium insertion/desertion and reducing cycling performance. To enhance the electrochemical performance of the MoS2 NSs, B2 O3 nanoparticles were decorated on the surface of MoS2 NSs via a sintering technique. The structure of B2 O3 decorated MoS2 changed slightly with the formation of a lattice spacing of ~7.37 Å. The characterization of materials confirmed the formation of B2 O3 crystals at 30% weight percentage of H3 BO3 starting materials. In particular, the MoS2 _B3 sample showed a stable capacity of ~500 mAh·g−1 after the first cycle. The cycling test delivered a high reversible specific capacity of ~82% of the second cycle after 100 cycles. Furthermore, the rate performance also showed a remarkable recovery capacity of ~98%. These results suggest that the use of B2 O3 decorations could be a viable method for improving the stability of anode materials in lithium storage applications.",Materials

Structure–performance correlation guided applications of covalent organic frameworks,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdPre-designed structures and tailor-made functions make covalent organic frameworks (COFs) quickly become promising reticular platforms for multidisciplinary fields. Despite the overarching success, controllable and large-scale synthesis of COFs is still a huge challenge. Moreover, the relationship between the structure and performance of COFs in various fields has not been well understood, seriously limiting their practical applications. In this review, we provide an insightful and fundamental understanding of COFs from structural perspectives, and correlate them with eventual performance in practical applications. By summarizing both the top-down and bottom-up approaches, we address how typical issues, such as the size, morphology, dispersity and stability of COFs, are resolved, which should be crucial for their function-oriented and large-scale production. Structural and physicochemical properties, such as pores, ligands, stacking, linkages, functional group, morphology, crystallinity, dimensionality and wetting, are also discussed in relation to various functions. In addition, in-depth discussions regarding the correlations between structural characteristics of COFs and their performance in catalysis, energy storage, gas/liquid adsorption and membrane separation are presented. Finally, perspectives for the future direction of this field are proposed, to provide useful guidance for the function-oriented design and scalable production of COFs to meet the practical requirements of applications.",Materials Today

Phosphorus Vacancies as Effective Polysulfide Promoter for High-Energy-Density Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium–sulfur batteries have aroused great interest in the context of rechargeable batteries, while the shuttle effect and sluggish conversion kinetics severely handicap their development. Defect engineering, which can adjust the electronic structures of electrocatalyst, and thus affect the surface adsorption and catalytic process, has been recognized as a good strategy to solve the above problems. However, research on phosphorus vacancies has been rarely reported, and how phosphorus vacancies affect battery performance remains unclear. Herein, CoP with phosphorus vacancies (CoP-Vp) is fabricated to study the enhancement mechanism of phosphorus vacancies in Li–S chemistry. The derived CoP-Vp features a low Co-P coordination number and the introduced phosphorus vacancies mainly exist in the form of clusters. The obtained CoP-Vp can reinforce the affinity to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and thus the shuttle effect can be restrained. In addition, the reduced reaction energy barriers and the promoted diffusion of Li+ can accelerate redox kinetics. Electrochemical tests and in situ Raman results confirm the advantages of phosphorus vacancies. The S/CNT-CoP-Vp electrode presents outstanding cycling performance and achieves a high capacity of 8.03 mAh cm−2 under lean electrolyte condition (E/S = 5 μLE mg−1S).

This work reports the fabrication of a unique super-sodiophilic, defect-rich and hierarchically porous skeletal carbon nanofiber (SCNF) host for SCNF@Na anodes using electrospinning of the low-cost, renewable lignin biopolymer. The uniform nucleation and plating of Na effectuated by the hierarchically porous structure coupled with the defect-induced formation of a resilient, F-rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer offers excellent protection to the metallic anode. The defect-rich porous structure plays an important role in mediating dense Na nucleation, planar growth, and electrochemical stability according to the depth profiling experiments and density functional theory calculations. The SCNF@Na composite anode maintains high Coulombic efficiencies (CEs) and electrochemical reversibility in asymmetric and symmetric cells. The full cells prepared by interfacing the SCNF@Na anode with a Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode delivers exceptional capacity retention of 106 mAh g–1 for 350 cycles with an average CE of 99.2% at 1C, and 103 mAh g–1 after 200 cycles at 4C.

Preconstructing Asymmetric Interface in Air Cathodes for High-Performance Rechargeable Zn–Air Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHRechargeable zinc–air batteries afford great potential toward next-generation sustainable energy storage. Nevertheless, the oxygen redox reactions at the air cathode are highly sluggish in kinetics to induce poor energy efficiency and limited cycling lifespan. Air cathodes with asymmetric configurations significantly promote the electrocatalytic efficiency of the loaded electrocatalysts, whereas rational synthetic methodology to effectively fabricate asymmetric air cathodes remains insufficient. Herein, a strategy of asymmetric interface preconstruction is proposed to fabricate asymmetric air cathodes for high-performance rechargeable zinc–air batteries. Concretely, the asymmetric interface is preconstructed by introducing immiscible organic–water diphases within the air cathode, at which the electrocatalysts are in situ formed to achieve an asymmetric configuration. The as-fabricated asymmetric air cathodes realize high working rates of 50 mA cm−2, long cycling stability of 3400 cycles at 10 mA cm−2, and over 100 cycles under harsh conditions of 25 mA cm−2 and 25 mAh cm−2. Moreover, the asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy is universal to many electrocatalytic systems and can be easily scaled up. This work provides an effective strategy toward advanced asymmetric air cathodes with high electrocatalytic efficiency and significantly promotes the performance of rechargeable zinc–air batteries.",Advanced Materials
Micro/nano-structure construct of carbon fibers reinforced graphene/CNT matrix composites for Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium‑sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been hindered by the difficulty of achieving satisfactory cycling stability of high sulfur loading owing to the structural instability and exaggerated shuttle problem. Here, we design and fabricate a “reinforced concrete” structure based on the carbon fibers (CFs) supporting graphene/carbon nanotubes (GC) matrix composites, followed by a slurry-casting process to produce the final CFs-S/GC cathode with 4.5– 5.5 mg cm−2 sulfur loading. The 3D architecture of the micro/nano-hybrid materials enhances the structural strength and builds an interconnected conductive network for efficient electrolyte infiltration and the rapid electric/ionic transport. Furthermore, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are growth on the surface of CFs by chemical vapor deposition to formation of CFs@CNFs. The CFs@CNFs-S/GC cathode enables the effective confines of polysulfides on electrochemically active sites, leading to a much-improved cycling performance. The strategy reported in this paper provides a feasible way for the construction of CFs or modified CFs skeleton in nanostructured carbon materials for high energy density Li-S batteries.",Diamond and Related Materials
Engineering a heteroatom-doped multidimensional carbon network for dendrite-free lithium metal anode,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLithium metal anode (LMA) has attracted widespread attention on account of its highest theoretical capacity and low reduction potential. However, the practical application of LMA has been long hindered by safety concerns and huge volume change resulting from the inevitable lithium dendrites growth. Herein, a multidimensional framework consisting of commercial carbon cloth (CC) and N, S-codoped porous carbon (PNSC) net (CC@PNSC) is fabricated and applied for LMA. This CC@PNSC skeleton has a large specific surface area, and the local current density can be significantly decreased. In addition, the synergetic effect of nitrogen and sulfur codoping endows CC with enhanced lithiophilicity and even lithium plating behavior. More importantly, the in-situ formed Li3N and Li2S during the molten lithium infusion process facilitate Li+ transfer kinetics and effectively homogenize the Li+ flux diffusion. The as-prepared CC@PNSC-Li composite anode exhibits high specific capacity (3 mA h cm−2, 500 h) and impressive cycling stability with a flat voltage profile at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 (750 h).

Bio/KOH ratio effect on activated biochar and their dye based wastewater depollution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Waste potatoes peels (WPP) were adopted as a Biomass in this investigation to produce highly porous activated Biochars. The carbonized-activation process was principally governed on double pyrolysis at 600 °C intercalated by intermediate thermal-chemical step for homogenous incorporation of KOH oxidation agent. The effect of CWPP/KOH precursors ratio and the second pyrolysis temperature were systematically carried out to study the activated Biochars physico-chemical properties (morphology, textural and chemical bands) using different techniques (XRD, FTIR, Raman, TGA/DTA, XPS, FESEM, EDX, CHNO/S, BET, Zeta potential). The obtained activated Biochars are in micro/nano-porous systems and have interesting SSA [580 – 2400 m2/g], pore volume [0.08 – 1.02 cm3/g] and average pores size < 4 nm depending to the activation conditions. Moreover, the second pyrolysis temperature has an effect on the carbon atoms structure reorganization which is proved through their high Raman and textural properties. To demonstrate the double activation process effectiveness and the resulting Biochars properties, we have studied their adsorption behavior to remove two kinds of dyes (cationic MB and anionic AZ). The obtained adsorption capacities have reached 1246 mg/g and 315 mg/g with an equilibrium contact time around [5–10 min] and [30–40 min] for MB and AZ dyes, respectively. These values have never been reported before, especially using the very low activated Biochar adsorbent quantity of 8 mg (at each initial pH and 100 mg/l concentration of each dye solution).",Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis

Here, a P-doped nickel tellurium electrocatalyst with Te-vacancies (P⊂NiTe2−x) anchored on maize-straw carbon (MSC) nanosheets, served as a functional layer (MSC/P⊂NiTe2−x) on the separator of high-performance Li–S batteries. The P⊂NiTe2−x electrocatalyst enhanced the intrinsic conductivity, strengthened the chemical affinity for polysulfides, and accelerated sulfur redox conversion. The MSC nanosheets enabled NiTe2 nanoparticle dispersion and Li+ diffusion.

Highly Stable Co Single Atom Confined in Hierarchical Carbon Molecular Sieve as Efficient Electrocatalysts in Metal–Air Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHSingle atoms catalysts’ (SACs) applications in the energy storage field are hindered by their insufficient stability and poor recyclability due to their oxidation and agglomeration. To address this challenge, herein, a Co-CMS composite material is synthesized by confining Co SACs into the highly ordered pores of the carbon molecular sieve (CMS). Related theoretical and experimental methods prove that the microporous trapping and hydroxyl doping of CMS are favorable for synergistically stabilizing the precursor and contributing to the subsequent conversion of single atoms with strong interactions between Co, O, and N. The unique 3D spiral pore structure of CMS facilitates the mass transfer of reactants and the highly dispersed Co single atoms confined in CMS increase the active sites.

Flatten the Li-ion Activation in Perfectly Lattice-Matched MXene and 1T-MoS2 Heterostructures via Chemical Functionalization,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe complexity of the ionic and electronic dynamics in MXene based hybrids, which are normally involved for device integration, triggers both challenges and opportunities for its application. Herein, as a prototype of metallic hybrids of MXene, heterostructures consisting of Ti3C2T2 (T = None, O and F atoms) and metallic MoS2 (1T phase) are investigated for lithium-ion battery (LIB) applications. It is found that different surface atomic groups in MXene significantly alter the affinity, redox reaction and kinetics of Li atoms in the interface of the Ti3C2T2 and 1T-MoS2. Through examining the three possible pathways of Li by first-principles calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics, the diffusion curve becomes significantly flattened from the naked to O- and F-terminated Ti3C2 MXene with activation barriers reducing dramatically from 0.80 to 0.22 and 0.29 eV, respectively, and accordingly promoted diffusion coefficients. The functionalization with O or F eliminates the steric hindrance of Li intercalation by breaking the strong interaction between two layers and provides additional adsorption sites for Li diffusion in the meantime. The work suggests that surface functional groups play a significant role in Ti3C2T2/1T-MoS2 modification and similar strategy via chemical modification of metallic hybrids provides hints for designing high performance anode material for LIBs.",Advanced Materials Interfaces

In this study, we designed a novel covalent organic framework-metal-organic framework (COF-MOF) material through an in-situ ligand self-assembly method. The in-situ modified ligands not only act as nucleation sites to form Ti-MOF, but also as a channel to rapidly transfer photogenerated electrons without introducing additional chemical bonds. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate achieved over B-CTF-Ti-MOF(1:1) was 1975 µmol·g−1·h−1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 4.76%, which is 11.8 times higher than that of the pure CTF-1. In addition, compared with the sample prepared by separating the ligands (CTF-1/Ti-MOF), B-CTF-Ti-MOF shows excellent activity and stability. Finally, a reasonable photocatalytic mechanism was proposed using the results of electrochemical tests and spectral analyses. This study provides a universal method for the construction of highly efficient and stable COF/MOF materials with excellent properties.",Chinese Journal of Catalysis
A High Conductivity 1D π–d Conjugated Metal–Organic Framework with Efficient Polysulfide Trapping-Diffusion-Catalysis in Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe shuttling behavior and sluggish conversion kinetics of the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS) represent the main obstructions to the practical application of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, a 1D π–d conjugated metal–organic framework (MOF), Ni-MOF-1D, is presented as an efficient sulfur host to overcome these limitations. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that Ni-MOF-1D is characterized by a remarkable binding strength for trapping soluble LiPS species. Ni-MOF-1D also acts as an effective catalyst for S reduction during the discharge process and Li2S oxidation during the charging process. In addition, the delocalization of electrons in the π–d system of Ni-MOF-1D provides a superior electrical conductivity to improve electron transfer. Thus, cathodes based on Ni-MOF-1D enable LSBs with excellent performance, for example, impressive cycling stability with over 82% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 3 C, superior rate performance of 575 mAh g−1 at 8 C, and a high areal capacity of 6.63 mAh cm−2 under raised sulfur loading of 6.7 mg cm−2.

Here, we designed a TiS2 monolayer as the anchoring material of lithium-sulfur batteries to address the obstacles encountered by lithium-sulfur batteries. Our simulation results showed that the TiS2 monolayer has dynamic and thermal stability, and can maintain appropriate adsorption energy between -1.38 eV and -3.54 eV for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), which can effectively anchor lithium polysulfide. Furthermore, TiS2 monolayer still maintains metallic properties after adsorption of lithium polysulfide, which ensures its excellent battery activity during charge and discharge. In addition, the surface of TiS2 monolayer has a lower Li2S decomposition barrier and a lower Li atom migration barrier, making TiS2 monolayer a promising anchoring material for lithium-sulfur batteries.",Materials Today Communications
Dual-Ion Flux Management for Stable High Areal Capacity Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Energy Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbHControlling the interaction between multiple ion fluxes is a major challenge that hampers the adoption of post-Li intercalation battery systems, which offer a multifold increase in energy density over existing technologies. Here, a dual-ion flux management strategy is introduced to simultaneously control the distribution of Li and polysulfide ions in high-energy Li–S batteries. This approach enables long-term use of high S-loading cathodes with 13.6 mgsulfur cm−2, achieving 9 mAh cm−2 areal capacity with 73% capacity retention for 1000 charging/discharging cycles. The battery system relies on the use of a multiscale membrane, with comparable size to existing battery separators, which simultaneously acts as an atomic redisperser for Li ions, dielectric and mechanical separator, polysulfide barrier, and extended cathode. Combined characterization and modeling reveal that the membrane is stable down to <1.0 V versus Li+/Li and result in a uniform Li-ion flux to the anode and effective polysulfide confinement and reutilization. The potential of this approach for application is demonstrated by the fabrication of stable pouch cells with a horizontal surface of 40 cm2 and 6.8 mAh cm−2 capacity. These findings provide an exemplification of the potential for effective multi-ion flux management for future energy storage and emerging electrochemical systems.",Advanced Energy Materials
Template synthesis of molybdenum-doped NiFe-layered double hydroxide nanotube as high efficiency electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdOxygen evolution reaction (OER) with four proton–electron coupled transfer process is a half-reaction that restricts the development of rechargeable metal-air batteries and water splitting devices, and it is of great significance to develop inexpensive and efficient OER catalysts. Herein, Mo-doped NiFe-layered double hydroxide (Mo–NiFe-LDH) nanotubes are synthesized using a self-sacrificial template method. Benefitting from the unique nanostructure, Mo–NiFe-LDH-2 exhibits a large electrochemical surface area of 63.94 cm2. In addition, a strong electronic interaction occurs between Mo, Fe, and Ni after Mo doping, resulting in highly active Ni3+ sites. Consequently, the Mo–NiFe-LDH-2 shows high OER activity with an overpotential of 317 mV to deliver a current density of 20 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1. This work provides a feasible strategy to develop high efficiency electrocatalysts through transition metal doping and structural regulation.",Materials Today Sustainability
Fabrication of platinum-doped WS2 hollow spheres catalyst for high-efficient hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.In this study, tungsten disulfide (WS2) was synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal method, and an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst was produced by doping the prepared WS2 with platinum (Pt) using platinum chloride solution. The diameters of the WS2 hollow spheres ranged from 400 to 2 µm, and they exhibited an overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA/cm2. The Pt-doped WS2 exhibited a low overpotential of 60 mV owing to an increase in the charge transfer rate and conductivity of WS2 upon Pt doping. The as-prepared Pt-doped WS2 exhibited excellent HER activity and good stability in acidic solutions. Therefore, the Pt-doped WS2 catalyst is an excellent candidate for highly efficient electrochemical hydrogen production.

Atomically dispersed cobalt anchored on N-doped graphene aerogels for efficient electromagnetic wave absorption with an ultralow filler ratio,"© 2022 Author(s).The widespread application of high-frequency electronic and communication devices has caused increasingly severe electromagnetic pollution. It is highly desirable but challenging to develop ultralight electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbers with strong absorption performance to eliminate the negative effects of electromagnetic pollution. Herein, a secondary ion adsorption and defect-anchoring strategy was proposed to construct ultralight N-doped graphene aerogels containing isolated single cobalt atoms (Co-SAs/GAs) with a tunable content of Co-SAs from 1.13 to 2.58 wt. %. The optimal Co-SAs/GAs with a matching thickness of 1.5 mm and an ultralow filler ratio of 5 wt. % attenuated about 99.999% electromagnetic energy and exhibited specific EMW absorption performance (SMAP) of 37 220 dB cm2 g-1, which was 15 000 dB cm2 g-1 higher than that of the best reported absorber in literature. Permittivity and electrical conductivity measurements indicated that the introduction of Co-SAs significantly increased the conduction and polarization losses of the GAs, which was confirmed by simulation results based on the Havriliak-Negami equation. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the Co-N4 moiety exhibited obvious polarization behavior, which could be further tuned by defective sites in its vicinity. This comprehensive investigation of the relationships between single-atom structure and electromagnetic wave absorption property provides an efficient route toward the rational design of ultralight absorbers with metal single-atoms.",Applied Physics Reviews
Oxygen Vacancy and Core–Shell Heterojunction Engineering of Anemone-Like CoP@CoOOH Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Efficient Overall Water Splitting,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Constructing cost-efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalysts for both neutral and alkaline water splitting is highly desired, but still affords a great challenge, due to sluggish hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) kinetics. Herein, an in situ integration engineering strategy of oxygen-vacancy and core–shell heterojunction to fabricate an anemone-like CoP@CoOOH core–shell heterojunction with rich oxygen-vacancies supported on carbon paper (CoP@CoOOH/CP), is described. Benefiting from the synergy of CoP core and oxygen-vacancy-rich CoOOH shell, the as-obtained CoP@CoOOH/CP catalyst displays low overpotentials at 10 mA cm-2 for HER (89.6 mV/81.7 mV) and OER (318 mV/200 mV) in neutral and alkaline media, respectively. Notably, a two-electrode electrolyzer, using CoP@CoOOH/CP as bifunctional catalyst to achieve 10 mA cm-2, only needs low-cell voltages in neutral (1.65 V) and alkaline (1.52 V) electrolyte. Besides, systematically experimental and theoretical results reveal that the core–shell heterojunction efficiently accelerates the catalytic kinetics and strengthens the structural stability, while rich oxygen-vacancies efficiently decrease the kinetic barrier and activation energy, and reduce the energy barrier of the rate-determining-step for OER intermediates, thus intrinsically boosting OER performance. This work clearly demonstrates that oxygen-vacancy and core–shell heterojunction engineering provide an effective strategy to design highly-efficient non-precious, bi-functional electrocatalysts for pH-universal water splitting.",Small
Low-cost magnetic clay derivants from palygorskite/MIL-101(Fe) for high-performance adsorption-photocatalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A low-cost palygorskite (Pal)/MIL-101(Fe) was prepared by solvothermal method and calcined under nitrogen protection to form the magnetic derivant Pal/MIL-101(Fe)-400, the successful combination of which was confirmed. The band gap (1.47 eV) of Pal/MIL-101(Fe)-400 was lower than 2.25 eV of Pal/MIL-101(Fe), indicating a significant improvement in light absorption performance. In addition, Pal/MIL-101(Fe)-400 exhibits stronger photocurrent response and lower impedance due to the formation of Fe3O4 clusters with high electrical conductivity and new active centers by calcination. The prepared Pal/MIL-101(Fe)-400 can achieve 90 mg/g RhB removal completely, which is better than 77.0% adsorption of MIL-101(Fe) and 67.2% adsorption-photocatalytic of Pal/MIL-101(Fe), which also shows superparamagnetism properties and excellent cyclic stability. In addition, Pal/MIL-101(Fe)-400 mainly relies on the action of peroxy radical to oxidize organic pollutants, which is different from Pal/MIL-101(Fe). This work provides a new perspective for the construction of magnetic MOF multifunctional materials for the efficient treatment of pollutants in water.",Applied Clay Science
Constructing a multifunctional mesoporous composite of metallic cobalt nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxides for high-performance lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Electrochemical properties of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are mainly hindered by both the insulating nature of elemental sulfur (i.e., molecular S8) and the shuttling effect or sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfide intermediates (Li2Sn, 3 ≤ n ≤ 8). In this paper, a three-dimensional mesoporous reduced graphene oxide-based nanocomposite, with the embedding of metallic Co nanoparticles and the doping of elemental N (Co/NrGO), and its simply ground mixture with powdered S at a mass ratio of 1:6 (Co/NrGO/S) are prepared and used as cathode-/separator-coated interlayers and working electrodes in assembled Li–S cells, respectively. One of the effective cell configurations is to paste composite Co/NrGO onto both the S-loading cathode and separator, showing good cycling stability (1070 mAh g−1 in the 100th cycle at 0.2 C), high-rate capability (835 mAh g−1, 2.0 C), and excellent durability (905 mAh g−1 in the 250th cycle at 0.5 or 0.2 C). Compared with the experimental results of Co-absent NrGO, electrochemical properties of various Co/NrGO-based cell configurations clearly show multiple functions of Co/NrGO, indicating that the absence of Co/NrGO coatings and/or Co nanoparticles may be inadequate to achieve superior S availability of assembled Li–S batteries.",Carbon Energy
Boosting Polysulfide Catalytic Conversion and Facilitating Li+ Transportation by Ion-Selective COFs Composite Nanowire for Li-S Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe large-scale application of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) has been impeded by the shuttle effect of lithium-polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish redox kinetics since which lead to irreversible capacity decay and low sulfur utilization. Herein, a hierarchical interlayer constructed by boroxine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high Li+ conductivity is fabricated via an in situ polymerization method on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (C@COF). The as-prepared interlayer delivers a high Li+ ionic conductivity (1.85 mS cm−1) and Li+ transference number (0.78), which not only acts as a physical barrier, but also a bidirectional catalyst for LiPSs redox process owing to the abundant heterointerfaces between the inner conductive CNTs and the outer COFs. After coupling such a catalytic interlayer with sulfur cathode, the LSBs exhibit a low decay rate of 0.07% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C, and long cycle life at 3 C (over 1000 cycles). More importantly, a remarkable areal capacity of around 4.69 mAh cm−2 can still be maintained after 50 cycles even under a high sulfur loading condition (6.8 mg cm−2). This work paves a new way for the design of the interlayer with bidirectional catalytic behavior in LSBs.",Small
"Layered thermoelectric materials: Structure, bonding, and performance mechanisms","© 2022 Author(s).The ever-increasing world-wide energy consumption and crisis of environmental pollution have aroused enthusiasm on developing high-efficiency and green-clean energy conversion technology. Thermoelectric materials enable an environmentally friendly conversion between heat and electricity, and therefore serve as an optimum candidate for solving the current dilemma and contribute to the carbon-neutral target. Among the thermoelectric family, layered materials have shared a great portion with impressive thermoelectric performance originating from their (quasi-)two-dimensional crystal structure with hierarchical bonding, i.e., strong intralayer and weak interlayer bonds. This structure and bonding feature is believed to be propitious to low lattice thermal conductivity, low-dimensional electrical features, and anisotropic electron and phonon transport behaviors, which offer great opportunity to disentangle the inter-coupled thermoelectric parameters. For those benefits, layered materials emerge endlessly in the field of thermoelectricity and have achieved extensive attention. In this review, we highlight the recent progress in the field of layered thermoelectric materials. The structure and bonding peculiarities of layered thermoelectric materials are outlined. Then, following the classification of single-unit, quasi-double-unit, and double-unit layered thermoelectric materials, the crystal and bonding features in some typical layered thermoelectric materials are discussed, with focus on their current research interest and progresses. The possible mechanisms behind the performance optimization will be analyzed. Finally, some personal views on the prospect of this field, including chemical bond perspective and interlayer electronic transport enhancement are also presented.",Applied Physics Reviews
"Defects on Li2S@graphene cathode improves the performance of lithium-sulfur battery, A theoretical study","© 2022 Acta Materialia Inc.Lithium-sulfur (Li−S) batteries are promising next generation large-scale electrical energy storage. One of our authors constructed a novel Li2S@graphene cathode material that exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance (Nat. Energy 2017, 2, 17090) in Li−S batteries, but the underlying mechanism remains unexplored. Herein we performed systematical theoretical study to address the mechanisms. First-principle calculation shows that the defects on graphene directly contributes to the superior electrochemical performance of the Li−S battery in three aspects. First, defects on graphene facilitate the binding of Li2S, thus lowering the decomposition barrier of Li2S during the first charge cycle, leading to the lowered activation voltage in experiment. Second, the followed Li ion diffusion is promoted by defects. Third, in the following discharge/charge cycles S-doped graphene is formed, which improves the conversion of S8 to Li2S during discharge process as well as inhibits the “shuttle effect”. Moreover, if vacancy defects remain on graphene, the above two advantages still hold, supporting the high rate performance observed in experiment. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the improved electrochemical performance of Li2S@graphene as cathode in Li−S battery from the perspective of defects on graphene, and helps the rational design of potential 2D materials as cathode for practical Li−S batteries.",Acta Materialia
Electrospinning super-assembly of ultrathin fibers from single- to multi-Taylor cone sites,"© 2021Ultrathin fibers have been widely used in thermal insulation, catalysts, drug delivery, tissue scaffolds, wound dressing, energy storage, energy harvesting, environment engineering, and textile industries. Electrospinning is a facile, universal, and cost-efficient technology for fabricating ultrathin nanofiber materials. On the other hand, porous structure and functional modification can be generated through interfacial assembly method. Accordingly, interfacial electrospinning assembly is emerged as an excellent strategy to prepare multifunctional ultrafine nanofibers. However, the traditional electrospinning using a single Taylor cone is facing a major challenge–low production efficiency, which can no longer meet the actual demand. Therefore, diverse multi-Taylor cone sited electrospinning have been developed, such as multi-needle, various needleless electrospinning and so on. In this review, different electrospinning methods of preparing ultrathin fibers are summarized, especially from the point of view of single Taylor cone site to multi-Taylor cone sites. The precursor materials species, electrospinning apparatus, nanofiber structure and scale-up equipment are critically discussed. It is foreseeable that multi-Taylor cone sited electrospinning can overcome the drawbacks of one Taylor cone sited electrospinning and make the large-scale industrial production possible.",Applied Materials Today

Compared with SACs, DACs have higher metal loading and more complex and flexible active sites, thus achieving better catalytic performance and providing more opportunities for electrocatalysis. This review introduces the research progress in recent years on how to design new DACs to enhance the performance of electrocatalysis. Firstly, the advantages of DACs in increasing metal loading are introduced. Then, the role of DACs in changing the adsorption condition of reactant molecules on metal atoms is discussed.

Finally, a brief summary is made and the key challenges and prospects of DACs are introduced.",Advanced Energy Materials
Uniformly Controlled Treble Boundary Using Enriched Adsorption Sites and Accelerated Catalyst Cathode for Robust Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHRechargeable lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) are recognized as a promising candidate for next-generation energy storage devices because of their high theoretical specific capacity and energy density. However, the insulating of sulfur, Li2S2/Li2S, and the shuttling effect of high order lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) hinder its practical applications. Herein, a heterostructure is explored to enhance the conversion reaction kinetics and adsorption ability of LiPSs. By rationally designing a conductive carbon framework and polar metal sites, both experimental and theoretical results show strong adsorption abilities for dissolved LiPSs and promote the conversion reaction rate. A CoSe2/Co3O4@NC-CNT/S cathode shows an excellent rate performance (≈1457 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and still retains ≈688 mAh g−1 at a high rate of 5 C). When performing charge–discharge in long-term stability at 2 C, the CoSe2/Co3O4@NC-CNT/S cathode delivers a high initial specific capacity of ≈780 mAh g−1 and retains ≈602 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles with an excellent Coulombic efficiency of ≈95.4%. Remarkably, the battery can entirely operate even at a very high sulfur loading of ≈10.1 mg cm−2 and lean electrolyte condition. This work emphasizes a new strategy to rationally design heterostructures that can encourage the industrial application of LSBs.",Advanced Energy Materials
Constructing High Efficiency CoZnxMn2–xO4 Electrocatalyst by Regulating the Electronic Structure and Surface Reconstruction,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHIt is an effective strategy to develop novel electrocatalysts with controllable defects to enhance their electrocatalytic activity and stability. However, how to precisely design these catalysts on the atom scale remains very difficult. Herein, several vacancy-dependent CoZnxMn2–xO4 catalysts are prepared through tailoring the concentration of Zn ions. The in situ activation of the obtained products accelerates the surface reconstruction. The superior electrocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the formations of MOOH (Mn, Co) active species and abundant oxygen vacancies, which are comparable to noble IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts. Zn-CoMn2O4-1.5 catalyst delivers a cell voltage of 1.63 V and long durability. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the appropriate Zn ion doping can improve the density states of p electron on the surface of catalysts significantly and benefit the d-band center closing to Fermi level, suggesting their high charge carrier density and low adsorption energy.",Small
Magneto-Electrodeposition of 3D Cross-Linked NiCo-LDH for Flexible High-Performance Supercapacitors,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHLayered double hydroxides (LDHs) with outstanding redox activity on flexible current collectors can serve as ideal cathode materials for flexible hybrid supercapacitors in wearable energy storage devices. Electrodeposition is a facile, time-saving, and economical technique to fabricate LDHs. The limited loading mass induced by insufficient mass transport and finite exposure of active sites, however, greatly hinders the improvement of areal capacity. Herein, magneto-electrodeposition (MED) under high magnetic fields up to 9 T is developed to fabricate NiCo-LDH on flexible carbon cloth (CC) as well as Ti3C2Tx functionalized CC. Owing to the magneto-hydrodynamic effect induced by magnetic–electric field coupling, the loading mass and exposure of active sites are significantly increased. Moreover, a 3D cross-linked nest-like microstructure is constructed. The MED-derived NiCo-LDH delivers an ultrahigh areal capacity of 3.12 C cm–2 at 1 mA cm–2 and as-fabricated flexible hybrid supercapacitors show an excellent energy density with an outstanding cycling stability. This work provides a novel route to improve electrochemical performances of layered materials through MED technique.",Small Methods

Adsorption and decomposition of H2S on C2N sheet with embedded manganese atom: First-principles calculations,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In this study, the catalytic effect of a single Mn atom embedded C2N (g-C2N-Mn) system has been examined for H2S molecule decomposition using spin-polarized Density Functional Theory including Hubbard U (DFT + U) method. The aim is to design and develop a suitable material for sustainable Sulphur-tolerant fuel cells. Firstly, we investigate the minimum energy profile for trapping and splitting of the H2S molecule. It is shown that the g-C2N-Mn substrate will preferably capture the H2S molecule approaching the Mn site in the cavity. As the reaction progresses through four intermediate states, it is found that the splitting of the H2S molecule into SH and H subunits by g-C2N-Mn is thermodynamically favorable and proceeds spontaneously without an energy barrier and will gain energy of 1.61 eV in the process. The PDOS analyses account for the evolution of the electronic properties of some specific atoms in the system as the reaction proceeds. The electron density difference portrays the charge localizations (ionic) and depletion (covalent) between those identified atoms participating in the reaction. It is noted that weak chemisorption and electron transfer play an important role in the splitting of the H2S molecule. The study provides a detailed theoretical approach for describing the H2S splitting by the g-C2N-Mn substrate.",Chemical Physics
Polaron hopping-mediated dynamic interactive sites boost sulfur chemistry for flexible lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Developing flexible and robust sulfur cathodes while boosting sulfur chemistry is a crucial enabler for the implementation of energy-dense flexible lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Here, we report an all-electrochem-active hybrid sulfur cathode by integrating nest-like O-defective RuO2 (RuO2-x) with sulfur to simultaneously realize decent flexibility, durability, and energy density. The mechanically robust RuO2-x with high electrical conductivity, active capacity contribution and high electrocatalytic activity is proved to be an ideal matrix to unlock high gravimetric and volumetric performances. Moreover, from jointly chemical and physical perspectives, it is confirmed that the polaron hopping-mediated dynamic interactive sites are formed in this RuO2-x/S system, which overcomes the reaction barrier and expedites Li-S chemistry. Impressively, the prototype pouch cells exhibit superb capacity retention under harsh bending conditions and harvest jointly high energy densities of 328 Wh kg−1 and 357 Wh L−1 under lean electrolyte condition, holding great promise for achieving energy-dense flexible Li-S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Fully-active crosslinking network derived from ionic liquid and MXene to efficiently immobilize polysulfides and promote redox reactions,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The performances of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) depend heavily on sulfur hosts with the desired properties including excellent electronic conductivity, high sulfur loading, strong polysulfide capture, and active catalytic centers. Here, we demonstrate 2D partially oxidized Ti3C2Tx MXene (PoMXene) can be cross-linked by Sb, N co-implanted carbon (Sb-NC) through Ti-O-Sb bond to synthetize Sb-NC/PoMXene. It is shown that the nanostructuring Sb-NC/PoMXene provides fast ion/electron transport channel and robust 3D architecture to alleviate volume variations. Significantly, the interweaved polar interfaces benefit rich binding sites from Sb nanoparticles, N atoms, TiO2 and Ti3C2Tx towards polysulfides, and the Sb-NC could catalytically accelerate redox kinetics, thus efficiently suppressing polysulfide shuttle. As a result, the Sb-NC/PoMXene/S hybrids represent high capacity (1148.4 mAh g−1 at 0.1C) and long cyclability (570.6 mAh g−1 after 700 cycles at 2C). When the sulfur loading is increased to 4 mg cm−2, the thick cathode still maintains a high areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm−2 with a decay of only 0.10% per cycle over 100 cycles at 0.2C.

Soft template-directed interlayer confinement synthesis of a Fe-Co dual single-atom catalyst for Zn-air batteries,"© 2021Dual single-atom catalysts (DSACs) with maximized atomic utilization efficiency largely depend on stabilization of dual-metallic single atoms on ideal supports, such as those two-dimensional (2D) atomic layers with open double-sided surfaces. However, the modulation of metal-2D support interactions is critical for enhancing the catalytic performance of DSACs, which has rarely been achieved by routine 2D atomic nanosheets. Here we report a soft template-directed interlayer confinement route for the synthesis of a Fe-Co DSAC. Fe and Co single atoms are stabilized separately on 2D carbon nanosheets via coordination with nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) heteroatoms to form a FeN4S1/CoN4S1 configuration. The synergistic effect of Fe-Co dual metal centers can optimize the adsorption/desorption features and decrease the reaction barriers for enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities. The Fe-Co DSAC exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activities of ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.86 V and Zn-air batteries with a maximum power density of 152.8 mW cm−2, outperforming the monometallic Fe and Co SACs.

The doping of PEO can increase the viscosity of PVA and alleviate the interface problem with enhanced ductility. With the addition of MBA, PVA-PEO formed a stable network structure through chemical bonding, which promotes the formation of pores in the gel. The alkaline composite gel electrolyte obtains solution-level ion conductivity of 2.1 × 10-1 S cm−1 at room temperature. From the perspective of interface contact, the interface reaction between the gel and the aluminum foil is discussed. Meanwhile, more C-O bond is preserved and absorbs excessive protons in gel, which can reduce the evolution of H2. The power density of the optimized gel Al-air battery coupled with pure Al is 44.5 mW cm−2. At current density of 5 mA cm−2, the capacity density is 1099 mAh g−1. The excellent porous structure in the gel ensures the rapid transmission of OH– and Al(OH)₄-, thereby prolonging the service life of batteries.

The plasmonic MoO3-x and WO3-x (MO3-x (M = Mo, W)) show tremendous potential in the utilization of NIR light owing to their localized surface plasmon resonance effect (LSPR).

The fabricated catalysts Co3W3C/CoP/NPC have shown prominent trifunctional electrocatalytic activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), evidenced by a positive half-wave potential of 0.803 V for ORR and a much low overpotential (at 10 mA/cm2) of 139/200 mV for HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Furthermore, the rechargeable zinc-air battery based on the optimum CoWCP-NPC-2:1 catalyst has shown a prominent high power density of 205.5 mW/cm2 and a specific capacity of 800.5 mAh·g−1 after 83.5 h/501 cycles at 10 mA/cm2. When the catalyst CoWCP-NPC-2:1 was employed as anode and cathode electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, only 1.49 V of cell voltage was needed to reach 10 mA/cm2.

Ordered Dual-Channel carbon embedded with molybdenum nitride catalytically induced High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have attracted considerable research attention because of their high theoretical capacity and energy density, low cost and environmental friendliness. However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides hinders the commercialization of LSBs. Effectively improving the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the sulfur cathode still represents a significant challenge. Here, a MoN@CMK-5 composite with a bimodal pore system was designed to electrocatalytically mediate Li/S conversion chemistry. MoN@CMK-5 presents a large specific surface area (1012 m2 g−1) and two sets of tunnels with pore sizes of 3.63 and 3.47 nm, which efficiently adsorb polysulfides and accelerate the mass transfer of electrolytes. Furthermore, MoN has high intrinsic catalytic activity and enables the rapid conversion of polysulfides. Owing to the synergistic “adsorption-conversion-mass transfer” effect, the electrochemical reaction kinetics are effectively enhanced. Consequently, the MoN@CMK-5/S electrode achieves excellent performance with an initial capacity of 1582 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and retains a reversible capacity of 658.4 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 1C. The cathode delivers a specific capacity of 475.8 mAh g−1 at a high current density of 5C, with a capacity decay as low as 0.027% per cycle during 1000 cycles. In addition, theoretical calculations reveal that MoN@CMK-5/S exhibits low activation energy for Li2S decomposition and effectively inhibits the shuttling of polysulfides.

Using Metal Cation to Control the Microstructure of Cobalt Oxide in Energy Conversion and Storage Applications,"© 2021 The Authors. Small published by Wiley-VCH GmbHHerein, a facile and efficient synthesis of microstructured Co3O4 for both supercapacitor and water-splitting applications is reported. Metal cations (Fe3+, Cu2+) serve as structure-directing agents regulating the structure of Co compounds, which are subsequently annealed to yield Co3O4. Detailed characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the in situ Cl-doping introduces oxygen defects and provides abundant electroactive sites, and narrows the bandgap, which enhances the electron excitation of the as-formed Co3O4. The as-prepared Cl-doped Co3O4 hierarchical nanospheres (Cl-Co3O4-h) display a high specific capacitance of 1629 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 as an electrode for supercapacitors, with excellent rate capability and cyclability. The Cl-Co3O4-h//activated carbon (AC) asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) electrode achieves a specific capacitance of 237 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, with an energy density of 74 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 807 W kg−1 and even maintains 47 Wh kg−1 at the higher-power density of 24.2 kW kg−1. An integrated electrolyzer for water-splitting with Cl-Co3O4-h as both cathode and anode can be driven by Cl-Co3O4-h//AC ASC. The electrolyzer provides a high current density of 35 mA cm–2 at a cell voltage of 1.6 V, with good current density retention over 50 h.",Small
Advances in host selection and interface regulation of polymer electrolytes,"© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Polymer electrolyte (PE) has been emerging as a promising alternative to liquid electrolytes due to the unique advantages such as excellent flexibility and processability, high chemical and thermal stability, and low risk of leakage and combustion, especially for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Even though abundant attempts focusing on polymer chemistries have been made, the inadequate capacity of lithium-ion transport via segmental motion still cannot provide satisfying room temperature ionic conductivity and lithium-ion transference number. In addition, safety concerns and short lifespan resulted from the brittle and incompatible interface between the electrode and polymer materials also hinder the commercialization of PEs-based LIBs. Hence, for the above performance defects and interface issues, this review provides an overview of polymer electrolytes from the conductivity improvement, polymer selection and mechanical strength enhancement for protrusion suppressing. The improvement of conductivity specifically includes structure modification of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) host and novel electrolyte matrix beyond PEO, while the section of interface regulation mainly involves dendrite-inhibited polymers, mechanical strengthening, and in situ polymerization. Finally, perspectives and challenges are pointed out in the development of polymer electrolytes with both excellent electrochemical performance and safety for LIBs.",Journal of Polymer Science
Synergistic effects of chlorine substitution in sulfide electrolyte solid state batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.All-solid-state battery is considered as one of the most promising competitors to Li ion batteries. Two widely known performance metrics for solid electrolytes, among others, are ionic conductivity and stability. Here it is found that both can be improved by the synergistic effects of chlorine substitution in sulfide-based solid electrolytes. Particularly, instabilities arising from both bulk decompositions and interfacial reactions to electrodes can be better inhibited in the chlorine substituted sulfide solid electrolytes through the increased susceptibility to the mechanical constriction induced enhancement of voltage stability. As a result, the stability window of some chlorine-rich Li-argyrodites can be systematically higher than some other chlorine-deficient or chlorine-free electrolytes, especially under the implementation of the mechanical constriction battery assembly and test conditions. Thus, a solid-state battery system of 4 V to 5 V-class cathodes paired with lithium metal anode is demonstrated using these chlorine-rich Li-argyrodites without additional coatings. Furthermore, since Cl composition modulates the stability and instability of Li-argyrodite at low voltages, it allows us to design a multilayer configuration with a hierarchy of Li metal stabilities to demonstrate the stable cycling at relatively high current densities for solid-state batteries. It is found that a moderate Cl composition in the electrolyte is the best to inhibit Li dendrite penetration as the central electrolyte layer, emphasizing a slightly increased “instability” as the hidden performance metric of relevance here, in addition to the two well-known metrics of stability and ionic conductivity. The understanding of the chlorine substitution effect in sulfide electrolytes provides an important design principle for all-solid-state batteries.",Energy Storage Materials

To effectively and comparatively study the confinement effect, the synthesis methods to prepare nanoparticles confined within the channels or support on the exterior surface of CNTs are crucial. Therefore, in this review, these synthesis methods to prepare CNT confined catalysts such as wet chemistry method and in situ encapsulation method are compared and analyzed together with the methods, for instance, wet impregnation method and temporarily blocking method etc. to prepare nanoparticles supported on the exterior surface of CNTs. Additionally, their thermal catalysis applications are discussed and reasons lead to their outstanding performance are specifically analyzed.

Strongly coupled cobalt/oxygen co-doped porous g-C3N4 heterostructure with abundant oxygen vacancies modulated the peroxymonosulfate activation pathway,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.How to resist the influence of inorganic ions and limit metal release for enhanced peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation have been always plagued by researchers. Herein, highly dispersed cobalt and oxygen co-doped porous g-C3N4 heterostructure (Co-O@CN) from g-C3N4@ZIF-67 composites was successfully fabricated, which could completely degrade ofloxacin within 20 min. Detailed characterizations reflected that the porous Co-O@CN-150 heterostructure not only endowed more active sites to be exposed but also facilitated the formation of a stable conductive structure. Besides, the synergy of abundant oxygen vacancies and Co-O-C bond accelerated the interfacial electron transfer for promoting the redox of Co2+/Co3+. Notably, Co-O@CN-150 heterostructure tuned the PMS activation pathway from radicals to non-radicals in weak acid conditions. Besides, the fabricated catalytic membrane system exhibited excellent efficiency for instantaneous degradation of ofloxacin and achieved self-cleaning performance during continuous flow-through filtration. This work could deepen the understand of the role of the covalent bond and oxygen vacancy and provided a novel tactic for practical wastewater treatment.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Position difference between Mo clusters and N sites induced highly synergistic electrocatalysis in integrated electrode-separator membranes with crosslinked hierarchically porous interface,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Herein, scalable integrated electrode-separator membranes with hierarchical porous interface are reported for promoting Li+/electrolyte transfer and Al-free refined Li-S battery configuration. The electrode side (CNT@Mo-NC) with ultrahigh porosity of 89% is composed with CNT as skeleton and Mo/N-codoped carbon (Mo-NC) as the crosslinked shell, the unique porous membrane electrode side and interface can strengthen transfer of Li+/electrons/electrolyte for fast reaction kinetics, and provide large space for polysulfide (LiPSs) anchoring and volume expansion. Furthermore, the N active sites with Li+-transfer transition function and Mo clusters with LiPSs adsorption and catalytic ability constitute a highly-efficient synergistic effect in mitigating shuttle effect and reducing energy barrier of redox reaction. For the Mo13[sbnd]NC-a surface with adjacent Mo and N, the LiPSs are adsorbed by Mo during the discharge process, and the N sites with lone electron pairs can accelerate diffusion of the positively charged Li+ to Mo, and to react quickly with LiPSs and transform into Li2S. For Mo13[sbnd]NC-b surface, however, the repulsion effect between Mo and Li+ during the charge process can promote the rapid migration of the dissociated Li+ to surround graphene due to the N center is occupied by Mo, which is beneficial to the dissociation reaction of Li2S. For the separator side (CNT@NP) with CNT as the skeleton and nonconductive polymer (NP) as crosslinked shell, the porous structure also facilitates the Li+/electrolyte transport. With uniform sulfur loading in the electrode side, an Al/Cu free Li-S battery with refined configuration and long-term cycle stability is formed. The proposed strategy has an important guiding significance for the design of membrane-based electrode/separator/interlayer with low ion/electrolyte transfer resistance in Li-S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Enhancing stability of Co9S8 by iron incorporation for oxygen evolution reaction and supercapacitor electrodes,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The structural instability of Co9S8 often degrades its electrocatalytic activity during long-term cycling, and rationally enhancing its structural stability remains challenging for energy conversion and storage applications. In this work, the density functional theory was used to predict the stability of Co9S8. The calculated results showed that stability could be improved through Fe-doping at the octahedral site compared to pure Co9S8. To validate the theoretical results, several Fe-incorporated Co9S8 hollow spheres ((Co1-xFex)9S8) with different Co/Fe mole ratios were fabricated by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The Mössbauer spectra indicated the preference of Fe replacement of Co at the octahedral site. The as-obtained (Co0.92Fe0.08)9S8 hollow spheres exhibited superior electrocatalytic performances with a low overpotential of 268 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, as well as a smaller Tafel slope of 63.9 mV dec−1 and robust stability toward oxygen evolution reaction for 60 h. The resulting (Co0.94Fe0.06)9S8 hollow spheres also exhibited a high capacity of 454 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and amazing cycling stability with 94.03% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. The superior electrochemical performances look promising and suggest the relevance of the proposed approach for the construction of future improved structures.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Highly dispersed Ru anchored on nanosheet N-doped carbon for efficient and chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroaromatics to aromatic amines under mild conditions,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.An efficient catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroaromatics to produce aromatic amines under mild conditions is highly desirable. In this work, a series of N-doped carbon (NC-x) with high nitrogen contents were firstly synthesized by pyrolysis of 1-butyl-3-vinylimidazolium bromide-co-acrylonitrile with a template of g-C3N4. Furthermore, Ru/NC-x catalysts were successfully prepared by ultrasonic-assisted impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by various methods in detail, e.g.X-ray diffraction, N2 physical adsorption-desorption, Transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectra, Scanning electron microscopy and H2 temperature programmed reduction. Characterization results revealed that N-doping on carbon contributed to the high dispersion of Ru nanoparticles and resulted in the forming of the electron-deficient of Ru species. Nanosheet Ru/NC-2 with high N-doping content of 28 wt% exhibited superior performance under room temperature, i.e., nitrobenzene conversion >99.0% and aniline selectivity 98.4%. Kinetic study indicated that the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene over Ru/NC-2 was the first-order kinetics with an intrinsic activation energy of 43.7 kJ/mol. Density functional theory calculation results suggested that Ru-Nx species, especially, Ru-pyrrolic-N facilitated nitrobenzene adsorption and H2 dissociation, resulting in enhanced catalytic performance. In addition, the excellent stability of Ru/NC-2 made it essentially reserved for 410 h in the fixed-bed reactor. Moreover, Ru/NC-2 exhibited superior performance for the hydrogenation of various nitroaromatics to corresponding aromatic amines. This work could provide meaningful guidance on designing effective and stable catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroaromatics to aromatic amines under mild conditions.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Oxygen atom adsorption on borophene doped with aluminum, argentum and aurum: A density functional study","© 2021In the present study, adsorption of oxygen (O) atoms on aluminum (Al), argentum (Ag) and aurum (Au) doped borophene was investigated using first-principle calculations. The electronic and optical properties of metal-doping borophene were determined using adsorbed O atoms. The obtained results indicate that Dirac cones near fermi-level for pristine borophene tuned to open band-gap and shift valence band due to near fermi-levels of doping and adsorbing atoms. Borophene retained fold strata with the doping of atoms. The electronic properties of borophene changed due to localization and hybridization between B-2s, Al-3p, Ag-4d, Au-5d and O-2p valence electron states in conduction and valence bands. The minimum values of Al, Ag, Au-doped borophene along (1 1 0) were blue-shift predicted by the proposed density function theory. The sharp peaks of electron energy loss spectroscopy were induced by the scattering of valence electrons.",Materials Today Communications

Efficient capture and conversion of polysulfides by zinc protoporphyrin framework-embedded triple-layer nanofiber separator for advanced Li-S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.The practical application of Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is significantly inhibited by (i) the notable ‘shuttle effect’ of lithium polysulfides (LiPS), (ii) the corrosion of the lithium interface, and (iii) the sluggish redox reaction kinetics. The functional separator in the Li-S battery has the potential to provide the perfect solution to these problems. Herein a triple-layer multifunctional PVDF-based nanofiber separator, which contains GoTiN/PVDF layer on the top and bottom and ZnTPP/PVDF layer on the middle, is designed. The polarity and porous structure of this multifunctional separator can greatly improve the wettability of electrolytes and enhance the transportation of Li+. With the zinc-based porphyrin framework (ZnTPP) structure, this separator has a strong chemisorption and LiPS conversion ability, which greatly prevent the ‘shuttle effect’. Consequently, the designed multilayer separator showed excellent electrochemical performance. As a result, the cell with GoTiN@ZnTPP@GoTiN nanofiber membrane displayed an initial discharge capacity of 1180 mAh/g with a benign capacity retention of 65.9% at 0.5C and high coulombic efficiency of more than 98.5% after 100 cycles. Even at 2C, it can still release a capacity of 798 mAh/g. Moreover, the remarkable capacity of 591 mAh/g could be achieved with a high sulfur load of 5.76 mg/cm2 under a current density of 0.1C. Based on these merits, this novel and scalable multifunctional separator is a promising candidate to replace the conventional PP separator for advanced Li-S batteries to deal with various challenges.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Pearl necklace-like CoMn-based nanostructures derived from metal-organic frames for enhanced electromagnetic wave absorption,"© 2021Metal-organic frames derived magnetic nanostructures have potential applications in various fields. However, the magnetic particles in the derivatives are frequently agglomerated, limiting their physicochemical properties. Herein, we cross CoZn-MOF particles through ultra-long MnO2 nanowires (MnO2@CoZn-MOF) as precursor for high-performance functional materials. After the carbonization of the MnO2@CoZn-MOF, MnO2 nanowires were transformed into MnO nanowires coated with N-doped carbon layer (MnO@CN), while the CoZn-MOFs were converted into N-doped carbon polyhedron particles encapsulated with Mn3Co7 alloy nanoparticles (Mn3Co7@CN), leading to the formation of hierarchically pearl necklace-like nanostructure (CoMn@CN). The magnetic Mn3Co7@CN nanoparticles are separated uniformly along one-dimensional MnO@CN nanowires, and thus the self-agglomeration of magnetic nanoparticles is avoided efficiently. As a result, the CoMn@CN exhibits excellent electromagnetic wave absorption property with an effective absorption bandwidth of 5.24 GHz as the matching thickness is only 2.0 mm. Experimental results and theory calculations indicate that the improved conductive loss and dielectric relaxation loss caused by abundant heterointerfaces and the electronic interaction between Co and Mn atoms are responsible for the excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance. Our strategy provides an efficient way for the synthesis of high-performance MOFs-derived nanostructures.",Carbon

However, due to the lack of efficient cathode materials for reversible insertion/extraction of Zn2+ ions, it remains a pivotal challenge to high cycling-stability ZHSCs. Herein, we report a facile two-step doping strategy to synthesize zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-derived N, S-codoped porous carbon dodecahedra (N, S-PCD), using as the high-performance cathode for ultralong-life aqueous ZHSC. Integrating the hierarchical porous architecture and N, S dual-doping, the as-assembled Zn//N, S-PCD ZHSC delivers a specific capacity of 133.4 mA h g−1 (300.2 F g−1) at 0.2 A g−1, and maximum energy density of 106.7 W h kg−1 at the power density of 160 W kg−1. Moreover, an ultra-long cycle life has been achieved with the device, retaining 97.1% capacity after 100,000 charge–discharge cycles (∼3960 h), which is the maximum life span for ZHSCs to date.

The Potential of Phosphorus Nitride Monolayer for Li–S Battery from the Anchoring and Diffusing Perspective: A First-Principles Study,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The performance of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery is strongly dependent on the sulfur electrodes materials. Due to the chemical interaction between electrodes and intermediates produced in charging and discharging process, the Janus-polar two dimensional (2D) electrode materials can enhance the electrochemical performance of Li–S battery by overcoming shuttle effect and increasing diffusion rates. Here, it is explored the structural, electronic, and dynamic characteristics of Li ion, S8 cluster, and lithium polysulfides adsorbed over Janus Phosphorus Nitride monolayer with blue phosphorene phase (b-PN) by using first-principles calculations. The reported findings highlight potential of the b-PN monolayer as a good host material, given that the large absorption energies of different clusters vary from −0.47 to −3.78 eV, which can suppress shuttle effect effectively. These strong adsorptions are origin from the chemical interaction between nitrogen atoms of the b-PN and Li atoms in lithium polysulfides in present work. Particularly, it is predicted that b-PN monolayer has extremely small diffusion barriers for Li ion and Li2S8 clusters of 0.10 and 0.03 eV, which leading to a higher battery charge and discharge rate than reported graphene and MoS2. It is hoped that this efficient strategy for promising host materials of sulfur-electrode guides the development of next-generation lithium–sulfur batteries.",Advanced Theory and Simulations

Construction of Moisture-Stable Lithium Diffusion-Controlling Layer toward High Performance Dendrite-Free Lithium Anode,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSpatially random lithium nucleation and sluggish lithium diffusion across the electrode/electrolyte interface lead to uncontrollable lithium deposition and the growth of lithium dendrite on metallic lithium surface, causing severe safety problems. Herein, a functional rapid-ion-diffusion alloy layer on the metallic lithium surface (RIDAL-Li) is designed through a simple chemical reduction reaction. Such a layer efficiently reduces energy barriers for lithium transport and thus significantly homogenizes the lithium atom flux for lateral deposition, which are confirmed by electrochemical tests, theoretical simulations, and spectroscopic analysis. Furthermore, the as-prepared RIDAL layer also displays a much higher corrosion resistance to moisture and oxygen. As a result, in ether-based and carbonate-based electrolytes, the pretreated RIDAL-Li anode can achieve a long stripping/plating lifespan of 900 h and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99% without dendrite growth. Even after being exposed to the ambient environment with relative humidity of 51% for 60 min, the RIDAL-Li can survive for stripping/plating 400 h and exhibit a low overpotential of 18 mV, displaying the superiority for ambient atmosphere battery assembly. Matched with LiFePO4 or sulfur cathode, the full cells exhibit remarkably improved stability and capacity retention, showing its suitability for applications in lithium metal batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
DeepTMC: A deep learning platform to targeted design doped transition metal compounds,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Exploring the influence of impurity incorporation on the stability and conductivity of crystal structures is crucial for energy materials and devices, which have catapulted to the forefront of material design. A remarkable feature of doped materials is the diversity of their compositions, which enables multiple substitutions of different element types and numbers to produce thousands of possible compounds and a virtually near-infinite number of multicomponent structures. Harnessing the full potential of these materials necessitates a rapid exploration of the multi-dimensional chemical space toward desired functionalities. However, trial-and-error experiments and high-throughput calculations cannot systematically and comprehensively study doped structures. Here, we present an efficient, accurate, and extensible deep learning model as a case study to predict the stabilities and conductivities of doped transition metal nitrides (TMNs), TM oxides (TMOs), and TM nitride oxides (TMNOs). We design and establish three high-precision models: a classification model (Chull) that can predict the phase stability with an accuracy of 89.8%, a classification model (Cgap) that can identify metals/semiconductors with an accuracy of 83.4%, and a regression model (Rgap) that can predict the band gap of semiconductors with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.35 eV. By integrating these three models, we develop a visual interactive software (DeepTMC) to targeted design doped transition metal compounds (TMC) with good stability and suitable conductivity. Importantly, the proposed method is not only applicable to the study of TMC structures, but also can be expanded to include more inorganic/organic databases, replacing DFT in qualitative studies of the doping effects and assisting the targeted design of energy materials.",Energy Storage Materials
Amorphous transformation of FeP enabling enhanced sulfur catalysis and anchoring in High-performance Li-S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Catalytic materials have recently been demonstrated to be effective in addressing the critical challenges of polysulfide shuttling and low utilization of sulfur in Li-S batteries. Although amorphous materials show advantages in typical electrocatalysis processes such as water splitting, the vast majority of catalytic materials developed for the sulfur cathodes are crystalline. Herein, we demonstrate the enhanced electrochemical performance of the amorphous FeP phase (aFeP) derived from a self-oxidation process of its crystalline counterpart. Electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculation reveal that the structural anisotropy of crystalline FeP is not in favour of important properties such as polysulfide binding energy, catalytic activity and electrical conductivity. Amorphous aFeP effectively overcomes these issues. Moreover, amorphous aFeP provides additional and stronger binding sites, enhanced electron exchanging between Fe-S and P-S atoms, as well as reduced HOMO-LUMO gap of the aFeP-Li2S4 adsorption system, leading to significantly improved catalytic effects especially for the capacity-limiting liquid–solid conversions. High specific capacities are achieved up to 5C and pouch cells with a high areal capacity (6.3 mAh cm−2) are also demonstrated. This study provides useful insights for the future development of amorphous catalytic materials in high-performance Li-S cathodes.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Quantitatively regulating defects of 2D tungsten selenide to enhance catalytic ability for polysulfide conversion in a lithium sulfur battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Introducing defects into 2D materials can increase the coordinatively unsaturated sites that are usually also catalytically active sites. How does the level of defects influence catalytic performance and how to take advantage of defects to optimize the 2D materials? In this work, anionic Se vacancies and edge dislocations are regulated in 2D WSe2 as a model of transition metal dichalcogenide host material for the sulfur cathode. The defective 2D WSe2 with different W/Se ratios are quantitatively investigated the influence of the defects on enhancing the cathodic process in lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. With a moderate level of defects, WSe1.51 shows the optimal performance for adsorbing polysulfides, catalysing polysulfides conversion, and promoting liquid-solid transformation, all of which are crucial steps for Li-S battery. The corresponding sulfur cathode delivers a high initial areal capacity of 11.3 mAh cm −2, and excellent cycle stability with a decay rate of 0.025% during 1000 cycles at 1C rate. Even in a pouch cell, the excellent cyclability and flexibility are still available. The results show the feasibility of enhancing the catalytic ability of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide by controlling the level of defects by which a long-cycle and high-energy Li-S rechargeable battery can be achieved.",Energy Storage Materials
An overview of the key challenges and strategies for lithium metal anodes,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdAnode materials play a significant role in the batteries system. Li metal has emerged as the promising anode material owing to their vital well-known merits, such as high theoretical specific capacity (about 3860 mAh g−1), the most negative potential (-3.040 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). Reports concerning lithium metal anode materials show increased potential in reasonable applications. Unfortunately, lithium dendrites, poor interfacial contact, the huge volume changes and sensitivity of electrolytes, limit the actual development of lithium metal anode. Even so, Li metal batteries (LMBs) with excellent performances are considered to be future energy storage systems once existing limitations can be worked out. Undoubtedly, a pressing need for new anode structure design arises to balance supply with demand. In this article, we begin with introducing the fundamentals of LMBs and enormous challenges, aiming at relevant issues and vital future trends in all aspects. In addition, some strategies of improving the stability of Li metal anodes are highlighted. Our main objective is to explore the mechanisms, design methods and development prospects of each strategy.

Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles and Fe3C nanocrystals on N-doped biomass-derived porous carbon for superior electrocatalytic oxygen reduction,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Nowadays, developing efficient and low-cost catalysts to catalyze oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is important to alleviate environmental pollution and energy scarcity. Herein, we describe an ORR electrocatalyst that anchors Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles (NPs) on the carbon support obtained from biomass (Sichuan pepper powder), which can effectively convert O2 into water. The precursor containing cobalt phthalocyanine and Sichuan pepper powder is modified with nitrogen-rich ligand-pyrrole by using FeCl3 as the initiator, and then the nitrogen-rich Co–Fe-based biomass carbon catalyst is synthesized by highly efficient one-step pyrolysis at 900 ​°C (defined as FeCoNC-900). It was found that not only Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles were produced, but also graphene-packaged metallic Fe3C nanocrystals around Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles were formed during the pyrolysis. The results show that the best performing catalyst (FeCoNC-900) exhibits higher half-wave potential (0.91 ​V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and better stability in an alkaline electrolyte in comparison with the 20 ​wt% Pt/C.",Journal of Solid State Chemistry
N-doped MXene derived from chitosan for the highly effective electrochemical properties as supercapacitor,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Chitosan (CS) rich in ∼ 7 wt% nitrogen is the renewable nontoxic biomass material derived from seafood waste. Chitosan is a suitable precursor to obtain N-doped materials due to the nitrogen in acetamide and amine of chitosan. In this work, the new type of N-doped MXene nanomaterials is prepared from non-toxic biological chitosan and MXene using a simple, environment-friendly method as a potential electrode for supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of 1MXene-1N reaches up to 286.28 F/g (154.59 C/g). After 10,000 charge and discharge cycles, the efficiency is always above 98%. The N-doped MXene turned out to be high electrochemistry and excellent stability due to the lone pair of electrons of the N atom and increased interlayer distance.

Ultrasmall antimony nanodots embedded in carbon nanowires with three-dimensional porous structure for high-performance potassium dual-ion batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Recently, potassium dual-ion batteries (PDIBs) have attracted considerable attention owing to the advantages of low cost, environmental friendliness, and high working voltage. However, the lack of suitable anode materials to adapt the slow diffusion of K+ ions leads to the low capacity and poor cycling stability of PDIBs, which seriously impedes their further development. Herein, a simple strategy is proposed to in-situ encapsulate ultrasmall Sb nanodots into N-doped carbon nanowires (Sb@NCNWs) with a three-dimensional (3D) porous structure, yielding high-performance anodes for PDIBs. The nitrogen doping and 3D porous structure can facilitate the transport of electrons and K+ ions, while the carbon matrix can effectively buffer the volumetric change of Sb nanodots during the charge/discharge process. Combining this Sb@NCNWs anode with expanded graphite cathode, we construct a novel PDIB with the alloying and intercalation mechanism in the anode and cathode, respectively. The PDIB displays a high capacity of 218 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 (based on anodes) and capacity retention of 92.5% after 400 cycles at 0.4 A g−1, which is the best performance among the previously reported PDIBs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Thin-walled porous carbon tile-packed paper for high-rate Zn-ion capacitor cathode,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Long ion pathway inside large-sized carbon particle or stacked 2D assembly greatly limit the electrochemical performance of practical carbon cathode (>10 mg cm−2) in Zn//C capacitors. Highly porous activated carbon and holy graphene can alleviate such ion-transport issue, but usually suffer from a far lower packing density and severe restacking, respectively. Herein, a kapok-derived quasi-2D thin-walled microporous carbon tile (CT) with optimized curvature and rich doping was developed and used as bricks. Assisted with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), a porous yet relatively packed paper cathode was constructed. The unique doped thin wall (∼700 nm) can effectively shorten the ion-penetration pathways from electrolyte deep into pore structure inside CTs, and thus enlarge ion-accessible surface areas. Combined with rational sub-micron interlayer spacing among proper-curved CTs and bridged-like SWNTs, the continuous ion/charge transport “highways” are fabricated. As a result, such self-standing carbon cathode delivers outstanding rate and gravimetric/areal performance (114 mAh g−1/1.37 mAh cm−2) without sacrificing volumetric capacity even at high mass loading (12 mg cm−2).",Chemical Engineering Journal
"MOF-driven ultrafine Co9S8 nanocrystals embedded in N, S-Codoped Multilayer-Assembled carbon nanoplates for efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.To achieve broad commercialization of regenerative fuel cells and rechargeable metal-air batteries, the development of non-precious metal-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is critical. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of MOF-derived ultrafine Co9S8 nanocrystals (∼6 nm) embedded in nitrogen- and sulfur- co-doped multilayer-assembled carbon nanoplates (Co9S8/NSCP) for highly efficient oxygen electrocatalysis through polymer self-assembly, metal–organic coordination, and subsequent space-confined pyrolysis. The resultant Co9S8/NSCP shows excellent catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high half-wave potential (0.9 V) and low overpotential (370 mV), separately. The extremely low reversible oxygen overpotential of 0.7 V is achieved in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, much better than those of single-component counterparts (Co9S8 or carbon), comparable or even superior to those of noble metal catalysts and recently reported advanced catalysts. The superior performance of Co9S8/NSCP can be attributed to the synergistic effect of highly exposed Co9S8 nanocrystals and heteroatom-enriched 3D carbon superstructure, enabling large surface area, protective graphitic layers, and abundant active sites towards fast catalytic kinetics and excellent durability. This work will open the door towards the rational construction of 3D carbon-based nanocrystals for a wide range of applications beyond catalysis.",Chemical Engineering Journal
WN0.67-Embedded N-doped Graphene-Nanosheet Interlayer as efficient polysulfide catalyst and absorbant for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery has attracted wide research attention due to its high energy density, high earth-abundance and low-cost. However, the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and corresponding shuttle will lead to serious capacity degradation and worse cycling stability of Li-S batteries. To address such issues, herein, we firstly present a novel interlayer of WN0.67-embedded N-doped graphene-nanosheets (WN0.67@NG) via a facile solvothermal reaction followed by nitriding treatment. The Li-S cell equipped with WN0.67@NG modified polypropylene (PP) separator exhibits outstanding electrochemical performances: a long-term stability with only a capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle over 200 cycles and a large capacity of 725 mAh g−1 at 4C; interestingly, a favorable capacity of 776 mAh g−1 can be maintained after 100 cycles at 0.2C for assembled Li-S pouch cell under a high sulfur loading conditions of 4.3 mg cm−2 with lean electrolyte occupation (6 μL mg−1). The outstanding performance can be attributed to the following advantages of WN0.67@NG interlayer: the high conductivity of NG sheets can facilitate the electron transfer and act as a physical block for restricting the LiPSs shuttle; most importantly, the polar WN0.67 nanoneedles embedded on the NG sheets not only provide abundant active sites for chemisorption and catalytic conversion of LiPSs, but also contribute to the nucleation and growth of Li2S; further theoretical calculations and in-situ Raman spectra clearly reveal the adsorption and catalytic conversion mechanism of WN0.67@NG interlayer at the molecular level. The work provides new insight into rational design and facile fabrication of multifunctional separators for industrial applications in high-performance Li-S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Coordination environment and architecture engineering over Co4N-based nanocomposite for accelerating advanced oxidation processes,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Innovating new Co-based materials to outperform widely-used Co3O4-based ones for eliminating recalcitrant pollutants via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation is dauntingly challenging. Herein we highlight for the first time that Co4N is a new-generation PMS activator, and illuminate comprehensive understanding of intrinsic activity correlated with coordination environment of Co site. The nanocomposite comprising Co4N nanoparticles immobilized on rGO, derived from a metal-organic complex, presents remarkable catalysis for 4-chlorophenol degradation via PMS activation, particularly, up to 42 times of promotion is harvested relative to Co3O4-based catalyst with similar morphology (0.682 vs 0.016 min−1). Theoretical calculations unravel that with respect to the common-used Co3O4 and Co, Co4N featuring N incorporated into interstices of Co framework has more suitable electronic structure to render optimal binding strength for PMS activation. This work points to the potential of Co-based nitrides for PMS activation, and enlightens that subtle engineering over coordination environment and architecture promises boosted catalysis.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Hollow-structured CoP nanotubes wrapped by N-doped carbon layer with interfacial charges polarization for efficiently boosting oxygen reduction/evolution reactions,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Structure engineering for electrocatalysts via interfacial charge redistribution plays a vital role in governing the electrocatalytic activity for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Herein, a hierarchical nanostructure consisting of one-dimension (1D) hollow CoP nanotubes wrapped by nitrogen-doped carbon layer (CoP-HNTs@NCL) is designed through a simple hydrothermal-phosphorization-annealing strategy. Morphology of CoP-HNTs@NCL-0.4 (mass ratio of GO to CoP is 0.4) shows that the exterior surface of hollow CoP-HNTs is firmly coated by NCL with a layer thickness of 5-8 nm. ΔE (Ej10(1.58 V, OER)-E1/2(0.91 V, ORR)) of CoP-HNTs@NCL-0.4 is as low as 0.67 V for ORR/OER, which outperforms commercial Pt/C and RuO2 and ranks the top of nonprecious-metal catalysts. Excellent activity and stability of CoP-HNTs@NCL-0.4 for ORR/OER benefit from synergistic effects between CoP and NCL, enhanced mass transfer via 1D hollow structure, and abundant active sites exposed on the interior/exterior surfaces of nanotube wall. Density functional theory calculations confirm that strong coupling interactions lead to interfacial charge polarization to remarkably promote the ORR/OER activities. This study highlights the functions of 1D hollow structure and interface effects in oxygen electrocatalysis, and opens a new avenue for interface construction by synergistically integrating favorable thermodynamics with efficient kinetics through modification of electronic structure.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Herein, an adsorption-complexation-calcination strategy based on channel confining effect is explored to obtain CoN-CoOx hybrid nanoparticles uniformly dispersed in mesoporous carbon. The CoN-CoOx/C composite exhibits excellent electrocatalytic behavior for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The half-wave potential and durability are comparable or superior to those of Pt/C. When applying as cathode catalyst for a primary zinc-air battery, the open-circuit voltage and peak power density reach up to 1.394 V and 109.8 mW·cm−2, respectively. A high gravimetric energy density of 950.3 Wh·kgZn−1 is delivered at 10 mA·cm−2 with good rate capability and stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates the favorable ORR intermediate adsorbability and metallic characteristics of CoN grains with oxide hybridization to optimize the electronic structure.

Single-Atom Catalysts: Advances and Challenges in Metal-Support Interactions for Enhanced Electrocatalysis,"© 2021, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University.Single-atom catalysts (SACs), which contain a single metal atom supported on a well-confined substrate, are among the most promising heterogeneous catalysts owing to their unique advantages, such as high intrinsic activity and selectivity, tunable bonds and coordination, abundant metal-containing active sites, and atomic economy. Since metal-support interactions (MSIs) in SACs exert a substantial influence on the catalytic properties, gaining a profound understanding and recognition of catalytic reactions depends greatly on investigating MSIs both experimentally and computationally. Hence, the engineering and modulation of MSIs are regarded as one of the most efficient methods to rationally design SACs with disruptively enhanced catalytic properties. In this review, we track the recent advances in SACs from an MSI perspective. We then discuss the existing MSIs in SACs and elucidate the significant role of strong MSIs in catalytic properties and mechanisms. The challenges hindering the rational design of supported SACs with strong MSIs, which are currently still far from being completely understood and overcome, are described. In addition, the correlation between strong MSIs and electrocatalytic activities in SACs, including an outlook to increase our understanding of MSIs, is discussed. Finally, the present review provides some perspectives and an in-depth understanding of strong MSIs to advance high-performing SACs.

In situ observation of electrochemical Ostwald ripening during sodium deposition,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Sodium (Na) metal batteries (SMBs) using Na anode are potential “beyond lithium” electrochemical technology for future energy storage applications. However, uncontrollable Na dendrite growth has plagued the application of SMBs. Understanding Na deposition mechanisms, particularly the early stage of Na deposition kinetics, is critical to enable the SMBs. In this context, we conducted in situ observations of the early stage of electrochemical Na deposition. We revealed an important electrochemical Ostwald ripening (EOR) phenomenon which dictated the early stage of Na deposition. Namely, small Na nanocrystals were nucleated randomly, which then grew. During growth, smaller Na nanocrystals were contained by bigger ones via EOR. We observed two types of EOR with one involving only electrochemical reaction driven by electrochemical potential difference between bigger and smaller nanocrystals; while the other being dominated by mass transport governed by surface energy minimization. The results provide new understanding to the Na deposition mechanism, which may be useful for the development of SMB for energy storage applications.

Deep eutectic solvent assisted facile synthesis of low-dimensional hierarchical porous high-entropy oxides,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.High-entropy-oxides (HEOs), a new class of solids that contain five or more elemental species, have attracted increasing interests owing to their unique structures and fascinating physicochemical properties. However, it is a huge challenge to construct various nanostructured, especially low-dimensional nanostructured HEOs under the high temperature synthetic conditions. Herein, a facile strategy using glucose-urea deep eutectic solvent (DES) as both a solvent and the carbon source of structure-directed template is proposed for the synthesis of various HEOs with two-dimentional (2D) nanonets and one-dimentional (1D) nanowires, including rock-salt (Co, Cu, Mg, Ni, Zn)O, spinel (Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni)3O4, and perovskite La(Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni)O3. The as-prepared HEOs possessed five or more uniformly dispersed metal elements, large specific surface areas (more than 25 m2·g−1), and a pure single-phase structure. In addition, high cooling rate (cooling in air or liq-N2-quenching) was indispensable to obtain a single-phase rock-salt (Co, Cu, Mg, Ni, Zn)O because of phase separation caused by copper. By taking advantage of unique features of HEOs, rock-salt (Co, Cu, Mg, Ni, Zn)O can function as a promising candidate for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) anode material, which achieved excellent cycling stability. This work provides a feasible synthetic strategy for low-dimensional hierarchical HEOs, which creates new opportunities for the stable HEOs being highly active functional materials.

Recent Progress in MXene-Based Materials for Metal-Sulfur and Metal-Air Batteries: Potential High-Performance Electrodes,"© 2021, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University.Abstract: Rechargeable batteries, which are used for renewable energy storage, have paved the way for reducing the enormous pressure of the energy crisis and environmental pollution. Recently, promising electrode materials with high energy and power density and favorable electrochemical performance for energy conversion and storage have been developed to meet the ever-growing demand for renewable power for electric vehicles or grid applications.

Single-atom Zn for boosting supercapacitor performance,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Single-atom metal-incorporated carbon nanomaterials (CMs) have shown great potential towards broad catalytic applications. In this work, we show that N-doped porous CMs embedded with redox-able Zn atoms exhibit superior capacitive performance. High Zn (∼ 2.72 at.%)/N (∼ 12.51 at.%) doping were realized by incorporating Zn2+ and benzamide into the condensation and carbonization of formamide and subsequent annealing at 900 °C. The Zn and N species are mutually benefited during the formation of ZnN4 motif. The as-obtained Zn1NC material affords a very large capacitance of 621 F·g−1 (at 0.1 A·g−1), superior rate capability (∼ 65% retention at 100 A·g−1), and excellent cycling stability (0.00044% per cycle at 10 A·g−1). These merits are attributed to the high Zn/N loading, atomic Zn-boosted pseudocapacitive behavior, large specific surface area (∼ 1,085 m2·g−1), and rich pore hierarchy, thus ensuring both large pseudo-capacitance (e.g., ∼ 37.9% at 10 mV·s−1) and double-layer capacitance. Besides of establishing a new type of high Zn/N-loading carbon materials, our work uncovers the capacitive roles of atomically dispersed metals in CMs. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano Research
Sulfurized-polyacrylonitrile in lithium-sulfur batteries: Interactions between undercoordinated carbons and polymer structure under low lithiation,"© 2021 Science PressLithium-sulfur battery (LSB) represents an important candidate to be used in energy storage applications, due to its high specific capacities. Sulfurized-polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is a candidate as a host material in LSB to replace graphite, due to its ability to chemisorb polysulfides (PSs). The sulfur chains attached to the polymer can reversibly form Li2S, and SPAN indicates to have a good cyclability and better performance than graphite, thus, SPAN acts partially as an active and also as a host material. In this study, we investigated the capacity of the solvent or the SPAN to lose a hydrogen atom from the backbone, to predict possible anodic reactions between solvent and host material. The simulation suggests that the photophilic salts may preferentially react with the solvent, and possibly building a cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). We observed that an undercoordinated carbon (Cuc) can be thermodynamically created, due to lithiation. The Cuc can react with the solvent on the polymer backbone through different mechanisms, however, the simulations indicated that the reaction should be affected by the interaction between the solvent and Cuc, according to SPAN's configuration. Moreover, Cuc reacts with long sulfur chains attached to SPAN, capturing sulfur and forming a C-S bond. A sulfur chain from one SPAN can connect to another polymer backbone, however, this process is affected by lithiation and vice-versa. Therefore, this work also investigates the formation of interconnected SPAN structures and the multiple Cuc effects.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

Lignin-derived Zn single atom/N-codoped porous carbon for α-alkylation of aromatic ketones with alcohols via borrowing hydrogen strategy,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.A green and scalable strategy has been developed for the synthesis of lignin-derived Zn single atom/N-codoped porous carbon (LCN@Zn-SAC) containing similar ZnNx sites with carbonic anhydrases. This catalyst exhibits superior activity on the α-alkylation of ketones with alcohols via borrowing hydrogen strategy (TON up to 15 h−1) than most of previously reported works. The dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol is the rate-determining step based on kinetic experiment results. According to experimental and theoretical calculation results, Zn electron density is inversely proportional to reaction energy barriers, because Zn sites with less positive charge (ZnN4 and ZnN3C) in Zn-SACs display better borrowing hydrogen ability than other Zn sites. Furthermore, this catalyst can be recycled by simple centrifugation, which can be reused at least 8 runs with no obvious lose in activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of non-noble metal-SAC-catalyzed α-alkylation via borrowing hydrogen strategy. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research
Support induced phase engineering toward superior electrocatalyst,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The phase transformation of catalysts has been extensively observed in heterogeneous catalytic reactions that hinder the long cycling catalysis, and it remains a big challenge to precisely control the active phase during the complex conditions in electrochemical catalysis. Here, we theoretically predict that carbon-based support could achieve the phase engineering regulation of catalysts by suppressing specific phase transformation. Taken single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) as typical support, combined with calculated E-pH (Pourbaix) diagram and advanced synchrotron-based characterizations technologies prove there are two different active phases source from cobalt selenide which demonstrate that the feasibility of using support effect regulating the potential advantageous catalysts. Moreover, it is worth noting that the phase engineering derived Co3O4-SWCNT exhibits a low overpotential of 201 mV for delivering the current density of 10 mA/cm2 in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Also, it reaches a record current density of 529 mA/cm2 at 1.63 V (vs. RHE) in the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR), overwhelming most previously reported catalysts.

Evaluation on a 400 Wh kg−1 lithium–sulfur pouch cell,"© 2021 Science PressLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are highly regarded as next-generation energy storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg−1. However, practical high-energy-density Li–S pouch cells suffer from limited cycling lifespan with rapid loss of active materials. Herein, systematic evaluation on a 400 Wh kg−1 Li–S pouch cell is carried out to reveal the working and failure mechanism of Li–S batteries under practical conditions. Electrode morphology, spatial distribution and species analysis of sulfur, and capacity retention of electrodes are respectively evaluated after the first cycle of discharge or charge. Considerable lithium polysulfides are found in electrolyte even at the end of discharge or charge, where the sulfur redox reactions are reversible with high capacity retention. Meanwhile, severe morphology change is identified on lithium metal anode, yet there remains substantial active lithium to support the following cycles. This work not only demonstrates unique behaviors of Li–S batteries under practical conditions, which is essential for promoting the progress of Li–S pouch cells, but also affords a systematic evaluation methodology to guide further investigation on high-energy-density Li–S batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
New insights into the key bifunctional role of sulfur in Fe-N-C single-atom catalysts for ORR/OER,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sulfur-doping of non-noble metal Fe-N-C single-atom catalysts (SACs) shows a key bifunctional role in promoting ORR and OER activity. The controversial claims about the enhanced ORR activity and the ambiguity of the OER activity brought about by S-doping demand in-depth investigation. Here, systematic theoretical investigation was carried out. Unlike previously believed, coordinative S-doping gives rise to a precisely regulated OOH∗ stabilization effect, which is revealed to be the origin of the bifunctional ORR/OER activity. The fine regulation is reflected in two aspects: (1) Compared with other intermediates, the regulation of OOH∗ adsorption is more obvious. (2) More sulfur-doping leads to excessive strong or weak stabilization, which is not conducive to ORR/OER. The single S doping elevates the charge density and opens the metallic spin channels of Fe-N3|S, moves the d-band center towards the Fermi level, all contributing to moderate OOH∗ stabilization. It is hoped that these results will promote the development of heteroatom-doped bifunctional SACs.",Nanoscale

2D/2D/1D Structure of a Self-Supporting Electrocatalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyMXene-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen production have been extensively studied. Herein, we report an efficient and stable electrocatalyst (TiVCTx/MoS2-CNT) with a 2D/2D/1D structure, which is used for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The catalytic performance can be attributed to the rich inherent anchoring sites of TiVCTx, which contribute to the uniform growth of MoS2 nanosheets and reduce the aggregation of MoS2 nanosheets. In addition, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are connected to form a 3D nanohybrid, which increases the conductivity of TiVCTx/MoS2 and provides a pathway for the electron transfer of TiVCTx/MoS2. As expected, TiVCTx/MoS2-CNT presented impressive hydrogen evolution activity with an overpotential of 180 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 79 mV/dec. Furthermore, TiVCTx/MoS2-CNT catalysts exhibit an electrochemical durability of up to 17 h in 0.5 M H2SO4. This work may provide a new idea for the construction of a three-dimensional nanohybrid and the development of an advanced bimetallic MXene-based nanohybrid for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).",ACS Applied Energy Materials
"Single-atom catalysts for high-efficiency photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting: distinctive roles, unique fabrication methods and specific design strategies","© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryHydrogen is regarded as one of the most promising energy carriers because of its renewable and clean nature. Among various routes to generate hydrogen, solar water splitting has received increasing interest due to the abundance of renewable and sustainable solar energy. Thus, it is crucial to rationally design and develop high-performance photocatalysts and photoelectrodes for achieving high-efficiency photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting, respectively.

"Morphological, electronic, and magnetic properties of multicomponent cobalt oxide nanoparticles synthesized by high temperature arc plasma","© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.Many technological applications demand large amount of nanoparticles with well-defined properties, which is feasible only by using large-scale production methods. In this framework, we have performed structural and local geometric investigations of cobalt oxide nanoparticles synthesized by high temperature arc plasma route in helium and in air atmosphere with different arc currents, a competitive and low cost technological approach to synthesize large quantity of different types of nanoparticles. The complex scenario of phase fraction, shape, size distribution and hysteresis loop features of high temperature arc plasma synthesis of nanoparticles can be determined by the arc current and the selected gas. X-ray diffraction patterns reveal a multicomponent phase formation containing cubic cobaltous oxide (CoO), cobaltic oxide (Co3O4) and metallic cobalt phases. The synthesis of different phases is confirmed by x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements at the Co K-edge. Both extended x-ray absorption fine structure and x-ray absorption near edge structure analyses show the presence of metallic nanoparticles in He ambient at high arc current. Moreover, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images and magnetic hysteresis loop measurements show that the mean particle size increases and the coercivity decreases with increasing arc current in air ambient due to the intense particle-particle interaction. At variance, in He ambient synthesized samples due to the high quenching rate and the high thermal conductivity, a multi-domain formation in which the nanoparticles' crystalline fraction decreases and a fluctuating coercivity due to core-shell structure is observed.",Nanotechnology
Electric-Field-Triggered Graphene Production: From Fundamental Energy Applications to Perspectives,"© 2022 The authors.ConspectusTwo-dimensional sp2-hybridized graphene has been seriously considered and applied in various fields, such as materials science, energy storage/conversion, catalysis, and biomedicine, on account of its unique long-range-ordered and π-conjugated structure as well as excellent thermal and electric conductivity. At present, the adopted methods for graphene synthesis cover micromechanical exfoliation, epitaxial growth, chemical reduction of graphite oxide, chemical vapor deposition, and liquid-phase exfoliation. Nonetheless, a number of issues and challenges still existed in these employed methods in terms of sustainable and green energy chemistry and environmental friendliness. Electrochemical exfoliation is one of the most promising methods for the large-scale production of graphene by virtue of simple/eco-friendly operation and high-efficiency production. Depending on different exfoliation methods (anodic, cathodic, and dual-electrode) and electrochemical exfoliation conditions such as the reaction device, raw material, electrolyte, and power-supply mode, the exfoliated graphene features various and versatile characteristics. The relatively perfect graphene with intrinsic long-range π-conjugated character is accompanied by the fast capability of electron transfer. The defective graphene features the adjustable size and defect density and tunable amphipathicity. As a result, the corresponding graphene has been employed in energy storage/conversion, biology, and medicine fields. In this Account, we summarize the recent progress in the fundamentals of electrochemical exfoliation to produce the graphene and the derivative exfoliation method and their applications in energy-related fields, and the corresponding perspectives are also highlighted. First, we describe the fundamentals for different exfoliation methods and electric-field-induced effects that can help to guide us to prepare and produce graphene with various properties, covering the size, defect density, and surface chemistry. Subsequently, three electric-field-triggered methods (anodic, cathodic, and dual-electrode exfoliation) are discussed in detail. In particular, the effects of various electrolytes and power-supply modes on electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EEG) are systematically underlined in terms of the exfoliation principles and process, which are the significant factors affecting the structure and properties of EEG and the efficiency of intercalation and exfoliation. In addition, the recent progress in multilevel applications of EEG in energy storage/conversion fields such as supercapacitors, secondary batteries, the oxygen evolution reaction, the hydrogen evolution reaction, the carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and so forth is also summarized. Finally, the expectations and future research directions for the EEG in terms of controllably technological parameters and conditions, precise monitoring and in-depth comprehension of the exfoliation processes, multiscale and diverse products (carbon quantum dots, graphene quantum dots, and single-atom catalysts), and large-scale preparation and application are discussed, which hope to provide significant guidance for future research.",Accounts of Materials Research
Covalently Interconnected Polymer Dot-WS2Nanosheet Heterostructure for Visible Light-Driven Hydrogen Production,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is a promising solution to energy and environmental crises. The aim is to design an effective and strong photocatalyst that makes perfect use of solar energy. This is possible when catalysts have a good visible absorption ability, wide band gap, slow electron-hole pair recombination rate, and a large amount of active surface area. Considering the important properties of an excellent photocatalyst, in this work, by mixing variable amounts of chlorophyll-assisted exfoliated WS2nanosheets with the COOH and SH functional group polymer dots named P-dots-COOH and P-dots-SH, respectively, we have developed P-dots-COOH/WS2and P-dots-SH/WS2heterostructure composites. The P-dots-COOH/WS280% heterostructure composite demonstrated a slightly higher current density (∼2.6 mA/cm2) than the individual P-dots (∼1.8 mA/cm2) and exfoliated WS2nanosheets (∼2.0 mA/cm2). However, the P-dots-SH/WS280% heterostructure composite demonstrated almost 200% (∼4.6 mA/cm2) enhanced photocurrent density and low charge transfer resistance compared to P-dots-SH (∼2.0 mA/cm2) and WS2nanosheet (∼2.0 mA/cm2) materials. This was due to the coordination of the thiol functional group of P-dots-SH with the defect interface site of the chlorophyll-assisted exfoliated WS2nanosheets that reduced the charge transfer resistance, increased the number of electron-hole pairs, and reduced the electron-hole pair recombination rate. We discussed the possible photocatalytic hydrogen evolution mechanism in which the P-dots-SH valence band position was lower than the WS2valence band position. These results indicate that photogenerated electrons can be transferred from the conduction band of WS2to the conduction band of P-dots-SH, which reduces the possibility of recombination of electrons and holes and is more conducive to the transfer of electrons resulting in the hydrogen reduction potential, that is, the hydrogen production.",ACS Applied Nano Materials
Synergistic effect of isolated Co and Fe dual active sites boosting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2021The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction is a promising and powerful approach to replace traditional fossil fuels. Herein, we have fabricated Fe, Co dual single atoms dispersed on nitrogen-doped graphene ((Fex, Coy)-NG) by freeze-drying method, which can as a highly efficient co-catalyst. The (Fex, Coy)-NG loaded mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) exhibits an excellently high performance for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The high activity can belong to two ways: (i) the ultrathin mpg-C3N4 not only increases the absorption and active sites but also shortens the charge migration distance; (ii) The nitrogen functional groups from NG can provide abundant coordination sites to evenly bind Fe and Co atoms. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performances (Fex, Coy)-NG co-catalyst with different content ratios of Fe atoms and Co atoms were also investigated. The optimized hydrogen production rate (1958 μmol g−1) of 5 wt% (Fe0.2, Co0.8)-NG/mpg-C3N4 is obviously higher compared to the monometallic counterparts (5 wt% Fe-NG/mpg-C3N4 or 5 wt% Co-NG/mpg-C3N4). The higher photoactivities are due to the synergistic effect between Fe and Co.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Herein, we construct a unique hollow-structured Co0.85Se/C as a separator modifier (CSPP) to effectively suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect. The Co0.85Se/C demonstrates strong anchoring with polysulfide species and smooth bidirectional electrocatalysis. The unique mesoporous hollow architecture affords sufficient catalytic sites and Li+ diffusion channels for promoting the reaction kinetics. Benefiting from the merits, the CSPP-cell could yield a superior electrochemical utilization of active sulfur, excellent rate capability (679 mAh g−1 at 5 C), and stable cycling performance with an ultralow fading rate of 0.056 % per cycle over 500 cycles.

Accordingly, the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to produce ammonia (NH3) using sustainable energy sources is considered a possible way to solve this problem. However, owing to the poor catalytic activity of materials, this approach for the production of NH3 is still far from meeting industrial requirements.

Dissolution of the Heteroatom Dopants and Formation of Ortho-Quinone Moieties in the Doped Carbon Materials during Water Electrooxidation,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Heteroatom-doped carbon materials are widely used as metal-free electrocatalysts and supporting substrates for many metal-based composites. However, almost all the current researches are based on the assumption of the self-stability of the heteroatom-doped carbon materials, neglecting their possible structural evolution during electrocatalysis, especially under harsh oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. Besides, previous researches always focused on the dropcast carbon-based materials with only a few participated dopants, leading to unobservable structural evolution during the electrolysis. Here, heteroatom-doped graphite flakes (GP) with a large quantity of participated dopants are chosen as the research model to multiply the transformation during the electrolysis. Through the combination of theoretical calculations and experiments, we present the nearly complete dissolution of the heteroatoms in N-, P-, and Se-doped carbon materials in the form of the high-valence oxoanions during OER. The oxygen-Abundant residues are proven to be responsible for the OER activity. Among the oxygen-containing functional groups in the residues, the ortho-quinone moieties, whose structures change with the doping elements, are finally identified as the active sites. Heteroatom-doped carbon materials as the supporting substrates for the metal-based composite experience a similar transformation, leading to unexpectedly different activity origins. Our work not only reveals the real active sites of the heteroatom-doped carbon materials for OER but also provides new insight into understanding the heteroatom-doped carbon materials as the supporting substrates for other anodic reactions.",Journal of the American Chemical Society
Facile and template-free synthesis of porous carbon modified with FeOx for transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryIt is necessary to develop cost-effective heterogeneous catalysts for the selective reduction of nitroarenes owing to the wide application of the product anilines. At present, porous carbon combined with transition metals is attracting increasing attention due to the inherent merits of the two components. Nevertheless, tedious and time-consuming procedures are generally needed to fabricate the catalysts, during which additional templates or activators are commonly required. In this contribution, a facile and convenient template-free method was developed for the synthesis of porous carbon modified with FeOx nanoparticles. The in situ formed sodium-containing species was responsible for activation of the carbon matrix. XRD and XPS measurements indicated that the FeOx was composed of Fe3O4 and metallic Fe, where the latter was deeply embedded in the material. The synthesis temperature had a notable effect on the porous structure and production at 700 °C generated the material with the highest specific surface area. The optimized catalyst not only showed good performance in the transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes, but also exhibited a relatively high stability. Further study demonstrated that both Fe3O4 and the carbon matrix play important roles in the reaction, with the former being the more critical agent.",New Journal of Chemistry

Template-Sacrificing Synthesis of Well-Defined Asymmetrically Coordinated Single-Atom Catalysts for Highly Efficient CO2 Electrocatalytic Reduction,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyAlthough various single-atom catalysts have been designed, atomically engineering their coordination environment remains a great challenge. Herein, a one-pot template-sacrificing pyrolysis approach is developed to synthesize well-defined Ni-N4-O catalytic sites on highly porous graphitic carbon for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO with high Faradaic efficiency (maximum of 97.2%) in a wide potential window (−0.56 to −1.06 V vs RHE) and with high stability. In-depth experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the axial Ni-O coordination introduces asymmetry to the catalytic center, leading to lower Gibbs free energy for the rate-limiting step, strengthened binding with *COOH, and a weaker association with *CO. The present results demonstrate the successful atomic-level coordination environment engineering of high-surface-area porous graphitic carbon-supported Ni single-atom catalysts (SACs), and the demonstrated method can be applied to synthesize an array of SACs (metal-N4-O) for various catalysis applications.",ACS Nano

Sulfide with Oxygen-Rich Carbon Network for Good Lithium-Storage Kinetics,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyTransition metal sulfides are of great interest as electrode material for alkali metal-ion batteries due to their high theoretical capacity. However, sluggish ion migration and electron transfer kinetics lead to poor cycling stability and rate performance, which hinders their practical applications. Herein, we develop a two-step localized carbonization and sulfurization method to construct a CoS2 composite material (CoS2@CNTs@C) from an in situ integrated zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) and multiwalled carbon nanotube precursor (ZIF-67@CNTs). The as-prepared CoS2@CNTs@C composites with a nanoscale carbon skeleton inherit a large specific surface area and suitable nanopore size distribution from ZIF-67 and incredibly abundant oxygenated functional groups from CNTs. The theoretical calculation and material characterization demonstrate that the oxygenated functional groups on the porous carbon networks accelerate lithium-ion diffusion and electron transfer and especially electrocatalyze the progressive conversion of Li2S6 to the final product Li2S. Meanwhile, the three-dimensional conductive network guarantees the conductive and structural stability of CoS2@CNTs@C during the repeated lithium-storage process. Therefore, the CoS2@CNTs@C electrode material can deliver an initial discharge capacity of 1282.3 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1 with a high Coulombic efficiency of 93.5% and a reversible capacity of 558.8 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1 in 600 cycles with a high capacity retention of 96.1%.",ACS Nano
Anchoring stable FeS2nanoparticles on MXene nanosheets: Via interface engineering for efficient water splitting,"© the Partner Organisations.Exploring highly efficient, economical and environment friendly electrocatalysts for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is necessary but challenging for economical water splitting. Herein, FeS2 nanoparticles were anchored on the surface of MXene through a simple adsorption-growth route (FeS2@MXene). By virtue of the large active surface area of FeS2 and its robust interfacial interaction with conductive and hydrophilic MXene nanosheets, the obtained FeS2@MXene composite can accelerate the transfer of mass/charge and facilitate contact between water molecules and reactive sites of FeS2. Specifically, MXene as a support material can not only alter the electrophilicity of the active centers of FeS2 through modulating the electron density but also prevent the aggregation of FeS2, thereby promoting activity and stability. The optimized FeS2@MXene delivers a 10 mA cm-2 current density at overpotentials of 87 and 240 mV in alkaline solution for the HER and OER, respectively, which is comparable with reported transition metal sulfide (TMS) based catalysts. More importantly, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the FeOOH generated during the OER process as a actual active species enhances the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. This work paves a new way for the interface engineering of TMS-based electrocatalysts towards water splitting.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers
Zn-O-C bonds for efficient electron/ion bridging in ZnSe/C composites boosting the sodium-ion storage,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Metal-selenides are one of the next-generation anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but they suffer from sluggish charge/ion transport, huge volume expansion and aggregation of particles. Herein, ZnSe/C composites with Zn-O-C bonds and 3D hierarchical structure were successfully prepared. Precisely, ZnSe nanoparticles are tightly riveted in the 3D carbon matrix crosslinking by Zn-O-C bonds. The 3D carbon network improves structure stability by restricting volume expansion. More importantly, experimental results along with DFT calculations reveal that Zn-O-C bonds served as electron/charge bridge accelerate charge/ion transfer, indicating fast reaction kinetics. Electrochemically, ZnSe/C composites show an ultra-long lifetime of 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1 with a capacity of 281 mA h g-1. Furthermore, the electrochemical mechanism of conversion and alloy reactions is revealed by monitoring the phase evolutions and internal impedance changes during the charge-discharge process. Remarkably, the superior cycling life arising from 3D carbon matrix and Zn-O-C bonds demonstrates ZnSe/C composites as reversible and promising anode materials for SIBs.

Constructing nickel sulfide heterojunctions by W-doping-induced structural transition for enhanced oxygen evolution,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Developing highly effective non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts is essential for real device applications but remains a challenge. Herein, we report a W-doping-induced phase transition strategy to synthesize W-Ni3S2/Ni7S6 heterojunctions. The W doping not only regulates the morphology of as-prepared catalysts to construct uniform nanorod arrays but also can induce the appearance of the Ni7S6 crystal phase to form W-Ni3S2/Ni7S6 heterojunctions which can enhance the intrinsic activity of the electrocatalyst. Consequently, W-Ni3S2/Ni7S6 shows a low overpotential (η1 = 202 mV and η2 = 285 mV in 1.0 M KOH for reaching a current density of 100 and 200 mA cm-2, respectively), and good stability, and is a promising noble-metal-free OER catalyst.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Investigating lithium metal anodes with nonaqueous electrolytes for safe and high-performance batteries,"© The Royal Society of ChemistryLithium metal batteries are promising candidates for meeting the increasing demand for next-generation energy storage devices with high energy density; however, the problems of lithium dendrites and unstable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) for lithium anodes with nonaqueous electrolytes severely hinder their practical applications. The first step to address these issues is to establish a better understanding about these phenomena. In this review, we first discuss the formation processes and related mechanisms of dendritic lithium and SEIs, which are revealed and supported by the specially designed setups combined with various advanced characterization techniques including operando scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and deduced theoretical models. Because of the high sensitivity of lithium metal anodes to the ambient environment, their microscopic characterization remained challenging until the development of noninvasive cryogenic electron microscopy. Then, we present the real-state atomic structures and chemical compositions of lithium dendrites and SEIs by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Based on these fundamental insights, various strategies including electrolyte engineering, construction of artificial SEI layers, and use of three-dimensional hosts for lithium, introduced to solve the lithium anode problems, are summarized. Finally, the future directions and opportunities regarding lithium anode research are discussed.",Sustainable Energy and Fuels
New insights on MXene and its advanced hybrid materials for lithium-ion batteries,"© The Royal Society of ChemistryElectrode materials with exceptional cyclic stability and high-rate performance have been in extensive demand for the fast growth of energy storage applications. The focus of this article is on the recent progress, scientific challenges and future developments of advanced materials as anodes based on the two-dimensional (2D) MXene-based hybrid materials used in next generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). There is a big issue that extensively affects their performance, such as the restacking aggregation problem of MXene flakes. To address this issue, a basic and effective approach is to combine MXene with suitable and advanced materials, such as silicon, tin, different carbon nanofillers, metal oxide, phosphorous, metal sulphide and layered double oxide, to form the MXene hybrid composites. MXene surfaces have been modified in many ways, including decorating with silicon and tin-based nanoparticles, bridging networks with carbon nanofillers, and forming a heterostructure between graphene and MXene layers. The hybrid material has led to high ionic mobility, high diffusivity of Li+-ions, and electrical conductivity apart from specific capacity. In the current scenario, advanced electrode materials of LIBs should be highly promising to enhance the electrochemical performance of the batteries to make it more efficient than previously observed. The MXene-based hybrid nanostructure materials provide insight into future challenges and guidelines for finding new materials used in next-generation energy storage applications.",Sustainable Energy and Fuels
A hierarchically porous TiO2@C membrane with oxygen vacancies: A novel platform for enhancing the catalytic conversion of polysulfides,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.In cases involving high levels of sulfur loading or high levels of current discharge, constructing sulfur composite cathodes via traditional coating preparation processes is an unsuitable way to overcome intractable problems relating to cathodes for use in lithium-sulfur batteries, such as poor conductivity, severe volume expansion, and the detrimental shuttle effect. Herein, a novel three-dimensional self-supported TiO2@C membrane with hierarchical interlinked porosity and oxygen vacancies was prepared via a phase-inversion method to act as a sulfur host. The procured TiO2-x@C membrane facilitates the infiltration of electrolyte, provides fast lithium-ion and electron transport channels and abundant sulfur loading sites, and shows superb structural buffering against the large volume changes during the conversion process between sulfur and lithium sulfide. More importantly, the introduction of oxygen vacancies not only enhances the conductivity of the original TiO2, but it also improves the corresponding adsorption abilities toward polysulfides and the subsequent transformation dynamics. Therefore, the TiO2-x@C membrane can significantly inhibit the polysulfide shuttle effect through polar chemisorption and conversion catalysis. Based on the above superiorities, the TiO2-x@C/S membrane electrode exhibits an impressive lifespan of more than 500 cycles at 2 C with a prominent ultimate specific discharge capacity of 715.2 mA h g-1.",Dalton Transactions
P-block tin single atom catalyst for improved electrochemistry in a lithium-sulfur battery: A theoretical and experimental study,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Main group metals are routinely considered as catalytically inactive. Hence, they are never employed for optimizing lithium-sulfur electrochemistry. Herein, density functional theory calculations reveal that atomically dispersed tin on a nitrogen-doped carbon substrate is expected to be highly active for electrocatalysis because of the activation of underfilled p orbitals and a significant shift of the p band center towards the Fermi level upon metal-support interaction. Under theoretical guidance, we prepared a p-block tin single atom catalyst (SnSA-NC) with Sn-N4 as the active site for effectively improving the lithium-sulfur battery performance. The charge transfer between the Sn atom and N ligands creates a highly polar site that exhibits strong adsorption capability towards the electrolyte-soluble long-chain polysulfides. The unique p band structure of the central Sn atom modulates the energy barriers for the rate-determining steps of sulfur redox, thus facilitating the lithium polysulfide conversion. Besides, the exposure and utilization of Sn-N4 sites are maximized by virtue of the 13 nm thick nanosheet morphology of the carbon substrate. Remarkably, the functional separator modified by SnSA-NC increases the sulfur utilization by 79.7%, and endows the lithium-sulfur cells with significantly enhanced cyclability and rate performance. This work successfully expands the employment of main group metals for electrocatalysis applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Metal organic frameworks derived Ni-doped hierarchical NiXCo1-XS@C bundled-like nanostructures for enhanced supercapacitors,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives in the area of energy store have received extensive attention. Here, 3D hierarchical bundle-like micro/nanostructure Ni-Co-MOFs were designed via a co-precipitation and external metal-atom doping strategy. Based on the distinctive precursor, a carbon coated Ni-Co-S nanoparticles were prepared through a two-step thermal annealing. The Ni doping into CoS can both regulates electronic structure and stabilizes Co species as electrode material for supercapacitor. By optimizing the content of Ni-doping, the fabricated NiXCo1-XS/C-3 with 25% Ni-doping shows remarkable specific capacitance (709 C/g at 1 A/g), superior rate capability and excellent cycling stability. An asymmetric supercapacitor with an energy density of 45.3 Wh/kg was acquired successfully in two-electrode system. NiXCo1-XS possess a high OH− adsorption energy compared to single NiS and CoS was proved by density functional theory calculations. Strong OH− adsorption ability is conducive to capture electrolyte ions, which leads to rapid redox reaction kinetics. In addition, this work provides new ideas for how to design metal sulfide-based supercapacitor positive electrode materials.",Electrochimica Acta
Sulfonated poly(vinyl alcohol) as an artificial solid electrolyte interfacial layer for Li metal anode,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe cycle performance of Li metal batteries with high energy-density is hindered by the stability of Li metal anode. In this manuscript, sulfonated poly(vinyl alcohol) (SPVA) was synthesized and used as an artificial solid electrolyte interfacial (SEI) layer to construct stable Li metal anode interface. The ionic conductivity of SPVA coating layer in liquid electrolyte was calculated according to the theories of interfacial polarization in heterogeneous systems by dielectric method. In the Li|PE|SPVA/Cu or Li/SPVA|PE|SPVA/Li cells, Li deposits beneath the SPVA layer, surviving from the corrosion of liquid electrolyte and excessive volume expansion. Benefited from the constructed stable artificial SEI layer, the interfacial polarization and internal resistance in the symmetric cells are reduced. The cycle performance of LiFePO4|PE|SPVA/Li cell has been greatly improved, which could be stably cycled for more than 500 cycles.",Electrochimica Acta
Anchoring Ru/RuO2 Nanoparticles on Porous Carbon Shell as An Efficient Cathode Catalyst for Li-CO2 Battery,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHRechargeable Li-CO2 batteries have received a lot of attention due to their high energy density and ability to fix the greenhouse gas CO2. However, the lagged kinetics of CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) and CO2 evolution reaction (CER) has been restricting the development and application of Li-CO2 batteries. Herein, ultrafine Ru/RuO2 nanoparticles anchored on hierarchical porous carbon shell (Ru/RuO2-HPC) is designed and applied as an efficient cathode catalyst for Li-CO2 batteries. The anchored Ru/RuO2 nanoparticles act as catalytic site not only accelerate CRR and CER kinetics but also tailor the reaction process of Li-CO2 batteries, making discharge products are more susceptible to form sheet-like by a surface-adsorption pathway, which is easier to be decomposed in charge process. As a result, Li-CO2 battery based on Ru/RuO2-HPC cathode displays enhanced electrochemical performances, including high capacity, excellent round-trip efficiency, and outstanding cycling stability.",ChemistrySelect
Recent advances in MoS2-based materials for electrocatalysis,"© The Royal Society of ChemistryThe increasing energy demand and related environmental issues have drawn great attention worldwide, thus necessitating the development of sustainable technologies to preserve the ecosystems for future generations. Electrocatalysts for energy-conversion reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) are at the heart of these renewable energy technologies, but they suffer from sluggish kinetics due to the multistep electron and mass transfer. State-of-the-art catalysts are thus highly desired to boost the conversion efficiencies, which are still inadequate. Recently, as a typical transition metal dichalcogenide, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with unique physicochemical properties has been verified as a promising material for catalyzing key electrochemical reactions (i.e., HER, NRR, and CO2RR), presenting excellent performances. Therefore, in this review, we give insight into the structure and synthetic strategies of MoS2. Recent advances in MoS2-based materials for the three key electrochemical reactions are briefly summarized. Open challenges and perspectives of MoS2-based electrocatalysts toward HER, NRR, and CO2RR are also outlined.",Chemical Communications
Connecting battery technologies for electric vehicles from battery materials to management,"© 2022 The Author(s)Vehicle electrification has always been a hot topic and gradually become a major role in the automobile manufacturing industry over the last two decades. This paper presented comprehensive discussions and insightful evaluations of both conventional electric vehicle (EV) batteries (such as lead-acid, nickel-based, lithium-ion batteries, etc.) and the state-of-the-art battery technologies (such as all-solid-state, silicon-based, lithium-sulphur, metal-air batteries, etc.). Battery major component materials, operating characteristics, theoretical models, manufacturing processes, and end-of-life management were thoroughly reviewed. Different from other reviews focusing on theoretical studies, this review emphasized the key aspects of battery technologies, commercial applications, and lifecycle management. Useful battery managing technologies such as health prediction, charging and discharging, as well as thermal runaway prevention were thoroughly discussed. Two novel hexagon radar charts of all-round evaluations of most reigning and potential EV battery technologies were created to predict the development trend of the EV battery technologies. It showed that lithium-ion batteries (3.9 points) would be still the dominant product for the current commercial EV power battery market in a short term. However, some cutting-edge technologies such as an all-solid-state battery (3.55 points) and silicon-based battery (3.3 points) are highly likely to be the next-generation EV onboard batteries with both higher specific power and better safety performance.",iScience
Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysts for Rechargeable Zinc–Air Battery: Fe3O4/N−C Nanoflowers Derived from Aromatic Polyamide,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe development of low-cost, high-activity bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for rechargeable zinc–air batteries is highly desired. Herein, N-doped carbon nanoflower embedded Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared using a simple and scalable method. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits excellent activity and stability toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as a small potential gap of 0.72 V between the half-wave potential of ORR and the onset potential of OER potential, which is superior to the most previously reported bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts. The corresponding zinc–air battery exhibits good charged/discharge cycle performance as well as excellent discharge property, with a power density of 136.8 mW cm−2 at 200 mA cm−2 outperforming commercial Pt/C (96.5mW cm−2). Experiment results and density functional theory demonstrate that the high catalysis activity is mainly caused by the surface oxygen vacancy of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. This study sheds new light on the ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst design.",ChemCatChem
Quasi-solid electrolytes with tailored lithium solvation for fast-charging lithium metal batteries,"© 2021 The AuthorsUsing quasi-solid electrolytes (QSEs) can make lithium metal batteries (LMBs) considerably safer. However, formulating QSEs with rate capabilities rivaling those of liquid electrolytes is extremely difficult. Herein, we develop a QSE characterized by safety, high conductivity above 2 × 10−3 S cm−1, and high lithium-ion transference number (tLi+) above 0.8. Computations and experiments reveal that these characteristics are achieved by adjusting the Li+ solvation through a weak interaction with the polymer skeleton and strong coordination with NO3−. The further inclusion of fluoroethylene carbonate leads to the formation of a Li3N- and LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase on the lithium metal. Consequently, QSE-based LMBs are capable of fast charging and high-power density, as well as stable and long cycling. By adjusting Li+ solvation and lithium metal stability, this work rationally develops QSEs for fast-charging LMBs.",Cell Reports Physical Science
Spatially separated oxygen vacancies and nickel sites for ensemble promotion of selective CO2 photoreduction to CO,"© 2021 The Author(s)The CO2 reduction reaction (CRR), which is key to addressing global environmental and energy issues, must overcome the strong C = O bond and is hindered by low CRR selectivity and activity. Here, we unravel the ensemble effect of catalytically active sites for promotion of CRR while suppressing hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). We design a 2D/2D hybrid consisting of an ordered assembly of nickel-rich Ni-Mn layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (NSs) and oxygen vacancies (OVs)-rich Mn3O4 (OVs-Mn3O4) NSs. On its own, Ni-Mn LDH demonstrates high CRR selectivity but mediocre CRR efficiency, whereas OVs-Mn3O4 gives a higher efficiency but poorer selectivity. The 2D/2D hybrid inherits advantages from both components, attaining high CRR selectivity and markedly higher efficiency than Ni-Mn LDH and OVs-Mn3O4. Calculations and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements reveal that nickel sites in the 2D/2D hybrid activate CO2 to generate CO2•– via a one-electron injection, whereas OVs in OVs-Mn3O4 promote light harvesting and charge transport without activating unwanted HERs.",Cell Reports Physical Science
Enhanced Structural Stability and Volumetric Capacity of a 3D Pyknotic Graphene Conductive Network via a Pillar Effect of Sn Nanoparticles for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.High volumetric capacity and durability anode materials for sodium ion batteries have been urgently required for practical applications. Herein, we reported a Sn-pillared pyknotic graphene conductive network with high-level N-doping. This densely stacked block offers high volumetric Na-ion storage capacity, rapid electrochemical reaction kinetics, and robust structural stability during cycling owing to the high capacity component (metallic Sn ≈847 mAh g-1), high tap density (≈2.63 g cm-3), high conductivity (N doping ≈5 at. %), and strong spatially confined and pillared structure. Moreover, theoretical simulations have indicated that the charge accumulation around the N-doped region is more pronounced compared to the pristine one, and electrons accumulate around the N atom while loss occurs at the Na atom. These studies also suggest that it might possibly contribute to higher conductivity and stronger electrophilic reactivity, thereby resulting in enhanced Na-ion storage performance. As a result, the as-obtained electrode material exhibits competitive volumetric capacity (1462 mAh cm-3at 0.1 A g-1), cycling performance (1207 mAh cm-3after 100 cycles), and promising rate behavior simultaneously.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Activation of the MoS2Basal Plane to Enhance CO Hydrogenation to Methane Activity Through Increasing S Vacancies,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyThe active site of MoS2 is usually located at the edge of crystalline MoS2, which has a lower proportion than that from the basal plane, limiting the hydrogenation activity. Therefore, activating the basal plane of MoS2 is expected to greatly enhance the hydrogenation activity. Herein, we prepared a series of MoS2 catalysts by acidolysis of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and subsequently pyrolyzing at high temperature with different atmospheres. Through analysis, we found that the prepared MoS2 catalysts were curved, which was different from commercial MoS2. Through X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization, it was found that the MoS2 catalyst pyrolyzed under a N2 atmosphere had a larger number of S-vacancies than the MoS2 catalysts under a H2 atmosphere. In addition, temperature-programmed reduction results showed that the Mo-S bond energy was decreased with the increasing content of S-vacancies, which might be related to bending. Sulfur-resistant methanation results indicated that the curved MoS2 exhibited increased CO conversion with the increasing S vacancies. Furthermore, density functional theory calculation was used to simulate the generation of S vacancy and numbers of S vacancies. It was found that with the generation of S vacancy, three unsaturated coordination Mo atoms were exposed around one S vacancy and became new active sites, resulting in enhanced activity. What is more, the higher methanation activity was attributed not only from more S vacancies but also from the decreased activation energy for CO hydrogenation activation.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Competitive nucleation and growth behavior in Li-Se batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.As a promising cathode material, selenium has attracted a great deal of research interest due to its high theoretical capacity analogous to sulfur in lithium-chalcogen batteries. However, unlike S cathodes, mechanistic understanding including fundamental observations on the formation of Li2Se and Se deposits, and their dissolution in Se cathodes remains at an early stage. Here, we directly visualize the dissolution and deposition reactions of Se cathodes using operando transmission X-ray microscopy, and build a nucleation site distribution map by tracking the individual solidification of electrolyte-soluble polyselenide intermediates into Se deposits. This real-time analysis reveals the nucleation behavior dependent on the depletion of polyselenides as well as the morphological characteristics through their subsequent growth, along with the different nucleation modes for particle-like Li2Se upon discharge and dendritic Se upon charge. We further propose that appropriate operating conditions, prioritizing the nucleation over the growth, can effectively utilize Se, precluding the dendritic growth.",Energy and Environmental Science
Ordered carbonaceous frameworks: a new class of carbon materials with molecular-level design,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryOrdered carbonaceous frameworks (OCFs) are a new class of carbon materials with a three-dimensional ordered structure synthesized by simple carbonization of metalloporphyrin crystals with polymerizable moieties. Carbonization via solid-state polymerization results in the formation of graphene-based ordered frameworks in which regularly aligned single-atomic metals are embedded. These unique structural features afford molecular-level designability like organic-based frameworks together with high electrical conductivity, thermal/chemical stability, and mechanical flexibility, towards a variety of applications including electrocatalysis and force-driven phase transition.

Application of Ni-MOF derived Ni-C composite on separator modification for Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In order to solve the problems caused by the low conductivity of sulfur and the shuttle effect of polysulfides in lithium-sulfur battery (LSB), we conducted a series of studies and successfully prepared Ni-C composite materials employing Ni-MOF as the precursor, which were used as coating materials for the separator of LSB. Two kinds of ligands, terephthalic acid and trimesic acid were used to react with nickel nitrate to obtain Ni-MOF precursors and their carbonized products were named as Ni-C(B) and Ni-C(T) respectively. Ni-MOF precursors with different morphologies were obtained by different ligands, the precursor of Ni-C(B) is the petal-like layered microspheres and the morphology maintained after calcination, the precursor of Ni-C(T) has the structure of drug flake and agglomerates into a massive structure during the reaction. Because of the uniform distribution of nickel particles and the advantages in morphology and specific surface area, the performance of batteries equipped with Ni-C(B) modified separator is better than that of Ni-C(T) sample. Through a series of electrochemical performance tests, the results are consistent with our expectations. When the sulfur area density in positive electrode is 3 mg cm−2, the highest discharge capacity of the battery using Ni-C(B) coated separator is 1413.7 mAh g−1 at 0.05C, 1169.7 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and 997.3 mAh g−1 at 0.3C. Furthermore, the initial discharge capacity is 926 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C and can retain a capacity of 600 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
Understanding the lithiation mechanisms of pyrenetetrone-based carbonyl compound as cathode material for lithium-ion battery: Insight from first principle density functional theory,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Regardless of the lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) promising electrochemical storage performance, only limited studies have been reported using theoretical calculations on the mechanism of interactions between carbonyl functional groups and lithium-ions in a carbonyl-based LIBs. Despite such efforts, a systematic study on the lithiation mechanism of carbonyl-based structure for designing cathode electrode material with well-defined step-by-step lithiation process aiming at optimum electrochemical performances is still a challenge. Herein, the electronic structure, reactivity, topological, and the electrochemical mechanistic performances of pyrenetetrone-based carbonyl compound was reported based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31+G (d, p) basis set. Four different configurations of the studied compound designated based on the lithiation; LiA, Li2A, Li3A, and Li4A were computationally modelled using the experimentally studied structure. The computed HOMO-LUMO energy gaps showed that Li3A has the highest energy gap and hence more stable compared to other compounds. Comparatively, our theoretical data strongly correlated with the experimental results of the synthesized structure of pyrenetetrone having a slight energy difference of 0.2eV. The chemical quantum descriptors showed that Li3A has greater tendency to accept electrons while Li2A is the best electron donor. Again, the quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules (QTAIM) topological analysis showed that interactions between O24–Li28 has the highest electron density of 0.0515e. The reduction potential increased as the bound Li atoms are added but decreased at the fourth lithiation (Li4A). The reduction potential of the experimentally synthesized pyrenetetrone is in good agreement with the theoretical calculated results and the higher value of redox potential of Li3A is attributed to its high lithium binding energy of 129.33 kcal/mol. Thus, our work reveals an optimistic strategy for designing and utilizing these materials in the fabrication of highly efficient carbonyl base organic redox materials for lithium ion battery.",Materials Chemistry and Physics
Self-energy corrected band-gap tuning induced by strain in the hexagonal boron phosphide monolayer,"© 2021We performed a first-principles study of the electronic behavior of a 2D hexagonal boron phosphide monolayer (2D-h-BP). The system was deformed isotropically by applying a simultaneous tensile strain along the a and b crystal axes. We analyzed the band-gap evolution as function of the deformation percentage, ranging from 1% to 8%. Results show that the system behaves as a direct band-gap semiconductor, with the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum located at the K point (1/3, 1/3, 0) of the Brillouin zone. This behavior is unchanged despite the strain application. The band gap underestimation, as computed within the standard DFT, was corrected by applying the G0W0 approach. Trends in the band-gap behavior are the same within both approaches: for low deformation percentages, the band-gap grows linearly with a small slope, and at higher values, it grows very slow with a tendency to achieve saturation. Therefore, the band-gap is less sensitive to tensile strain for deformations near 8%. The origin of this band gap behavior is explained in terms of the projected density of states and charge densities, and it can be attributed to Coulomb interactions, and charge redistributions due to the applied tensile strain. To study the carrier mobility, we computed the electron and hole effective masses, finding high mobility for both carriers. Finally, the stability analysis of each strained system includes the calculation of phonon spectra, to assure the dynamical stability, the computation of elastic constants to evaluate the mechanical stability, and cohesive energies for exploring the thermodynamical stability. Results indicate that the boron phosphide monolayer is stable under the calculated tensile strains.",Computational Materials Science

Herein, CoFe decorated bougainvillea-like N-doped carbon nanoflowers (CoFe-NCNFs) are synthesized through a one-step aminouracil-assisted pyrolysis strategy. Benefit from the abundant active sites from the flower-like structures, along with synergistic effect between multi-compositions, the catalyst displays distinct improvement on the ORR with the more positive onset potential (Eonset = 1.06 V) and half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.85 V), coupled with the small overpotential (η) of 323 mV and 212 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for OER and HER, respectively.

Self-sustained recovery of silver with stainless-steel based Cobalt/Molybdenum/Manganese polycrystalline catalytic electrode in bio-electroreduction microbial fuel cell (BEMFC),"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In this study, a novel bio-electroreduction microbial fuel cell (BEMFC) assisted by stainless-steel based Cobalt/Molybdenum/Manganese (Co/Mo/Mn-SS) polycrystalline catalytic electrode was used to achieve high recovery to silver. The exoelectrogens (Shewanella sp. etc.) using organic wastewater (the inflow was controlled at 1.2 L d−1) as nutrient matrix in the anode chamber generated electrons, while silver ions were simultaneously electroreduced and electrodeposited on the surface of the catalytic electrode as electron acceptors. Silver nanoplates could be observed directly. The products of electroreduction on the cathode were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffractometer (XRD), and the results of electrochemical characterization confirmed the existence of silver in the products. In the operation, the silver ions were in-situ recovered and enriched from the initial concentration of 20–300 mg L−1 to almost complete recovery (8–18 h), with the maximum power density of 1008.2 mW m−2 and 5.5 A m−2 current density. The recovery efficiency of silver in the BEMFC using the Co/Mo/Mn-SS electrode was up to 9.60 kg m−2h−1, and the energy efficiency was 27.8 kg kWh−1. Under the continuous flow operation mode, the BEMFC still achieved 90.2% recovery efficiency of the silver.",Journal of Hazardous Materials
1T-Phase molybdenum sulfide/cobalt oxide nanopillars hybrid nanostructure coupled with nitrogen-doped carbon thin-film as high efficiency electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.High efficient and durable catalysts are always needed to lower the kinetic barriers as well as prolong the service life associated with oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a sequential synthetic strategy is considered to prepare a hierarchical nanostructure, in which each component can be configured to achieve their full potential so that endows the resulting nanocatalyst a good overall performance. In order to realize this, well-organized cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanopillars are firstly grown onto ultrathin 1T-molybdenum sulfide (1T-MoS2) to obtain high surface area electrocatalyst, providing electron transfer pathways and structural stability. After that, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) derived carbonization film is further in situ deposited on the surface of nanopillars to generate plentiful active sites, thereby accelerating OER kinetics. Based on the combination of different components, the electron transfer capability, catalytic activity and durability are optimized and fully implemented. The obtained nanocatalyst (defined as 1T-MoS2/Co3O4/CN) exhibits the superior OER catalytic ability with the overpotential of 202 mV and Tafel slope of 57 mV·dec−1 at 10 mA·cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH, and good durability with a minor chronoamperometric decay of 9.15 % after 60,000 s of polarization.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
"Strong coordination ability of sulfur with cobalt for facilitating scale-up synthesis of Co9S8 encapsulated S, N co-doped carbon as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction","© 2021 Elsevier Inc.High activity trifunctional non-noble electrocatalysts, targeting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), are rationally designed by integrating the merits of both Co9S8 nanoparticles and carbons nanosheets. Herein, Co9S8 loaded with S, N co-doped carbon core–shell catalyst (Co9S8@SNC) was reasonably designed and synthesized by using the strong coordination effect between Co2+ and C[dbnd]S at the molecular level. The significant synergistic effect between the S, N co-doped carbon shell and Co9S8 core endows the catalyst with excellent catalytic performance for ORR, HER, and OER reactions. The carbon shell enhances the conductivity of the hybrid material, while the Co9S8 core provides the main catalytic active sites. More specifically, the half-wave potential for ORR is 0.846 mV, and the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 for OER and HER are 320 mV and 170 mV, respectively. To test its practical application, zinc-air battery assembled by Co9S8@SNC shows a high power density of 239 mW cm−2, excellent rechargeability, and long cyclic stability. This work provides a promising and extensible method to in-situ synthesize core–shell metal sulfides loaded S, N co-doped carbon composites, which can be a promising candidate for electrocatalytic material in energy storage and conversion devices.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Sintered Ni metal as a matrix of robust self-supporting electrode for ultra-stable hydrogen evolution,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.For the self-supporting catalysts of Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the rational design and fabrication of substrate with porous structure and sufficient mechanical strength are critical to promoting the industrial HER application. In this work, a novel porous sintered Ni metal as the matrix for supporting catalysts was successfully prepared by powder metallurgy, and a self-supporting electrode for HER was fabricated via a simple sulfurization process on this sintered Ni metal matrix. For instance, MoS2/Ni3S2 nanorods (NRs) were vertically grown on the as-sintered porous Ni matrix, and the morphology of the sintered Ni matrix significantly affected the growth of MoS2/Ni3S2 NRs. The NRs@Sintered Ni electrode shows a low overpotential of η10 = 56 mV and Tafel slope of 82 mV dec−1. Compared with NRs@Ni foam, the NRs@Sintered Ni exhibits superior stability, where no exfoliation and cracks are observed on the surface of the electrode after 5000 CV cycles. Ultra-high stability and long-term durability are obtained over 100 h even at high potentials of 200 and 300 mV. Moreover, the tensile strength of the as-obtained electrode based on the sintered Ni manifests nearly 260 times higher than that of NRs@Ni foam, evidencing an excellent mechanical property. This work provides an idea for the preparation of self-supporting metal-based catalytic electrodes in large-scale hydrogen production.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Highly efficient electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction to syngas with tunable ratios over pyridinic- nitrogen rich ultrathin carbon nanosheets,"© 2021Developing nonmetallic carbon-based electrocatalysts that are affordable and have high activity and stability for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction to syngas is a new and challenging strategy for solving the energy crisis. Here, we prepared a highly active ultrathin nitrogen (N)-doped carbon nanosheet (UNCN) electrocatalyst. By tuning the applied potential of the UNCN-900 (900 represents the carbonization temperature) electrode, we could tune the H2/CO ratio in clean syngas within a wide range with extra-high Faradic efficiency (FE). The maximum FECO reached 91%, which represented the highest value among the reported nonmetallic carbon-based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to syngas. According to the results of experiments and density functional theory calculations, we proved that pyridinic-N in UNCNs-900 is the active site of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and that graphitic-N may be the active site for the hydrogen evolution reaction. These results provide a useful case for electrochemical CO2 reduction to syngas with a tunable H2/CO ratio using nonmetallic carbon-based electrocatalysts.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Tailoring oxygenated groups of monolithic cobalt-nitrogen-carbon frameworks for highly efficient hydrogen peroxide production in acidic media,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a promising alternative method for industrial production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Although transition metal-nitrogen-carbon moieties have been regarded as efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), they are generally established for four-electron (4e−) pathway, rather than two-electron (2e−) one for selective generation of H2O2. Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve cobalt-carbon hybrids with high 2e− selectivity for H2O2 production in acidic media via tailoring their surface structure and coordination environment. The correlation between 2e− ORR selectivity of the fabricated monolithic electrodes, i.e. Co nanoparticles embedded in N-doped oxo carbon framework (CoNCF), and their oxygen-containing functional groups is revealed. In particular, an excellent H2O2 selectivity over 91 % in 0.05 M H2SO4 is achieved, which exceeds most of previously reported 2e− ORR electrocatalysts. Moreover, a sterilization system for water disinfection is constructed, demonstrating potential practical applications. The smart design of multi-active sites and porous monolithic architecture opens a new avenue for preparing advanced electrode for H2O2 generation and other environment/energy-related systems.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Boosting the polysulfides adsorption-catalysis process on carbon nanotube interlayer via a simple polyelectrolyte-assisted strategy for high-performance lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The introduction of conductive interlayer is an effective strategy to improve the sulfur utilization and restrict the migration of polysulfides for high-performance Li-S battery. Herein, a multifunctional CNT based interlayer was obtained by a simple polyelectrolyte (PDDA-TFSI) modified method. Due to the electro-positivity of PDDA-TFSI and the electronic coupling between CNT and PDDA-TFSI, the CNT/PDDA-TFSI interlayer exhibits a strong adsorption and effective catalysis towards polysulfides. Furthermore, the continuous CNT network ensures the successful electron transport during the charge-discharge process. As expected, the electrochemical properties of Li-S battery can be promoted significantly with the assistance of CNT/PDDA-TFSI interlayer. Even after 300 cycles, the CNT/PDDA-TFSI interlayer-based Li-S battery also delivers a higher capacity retention of 79.2%, proceeding Li-S batteries with and without CNT interlayer. This work proves that CNT/PDDA-TFSI film as a multifunctional interlayer has a promising application in advanced Li-S battery.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Interfacial engineering in hollow NiS2/FeS2-NSGA heterostructures with efficient catalytic activity for advanced Li-CO2 battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Lowering the charge barrier is of central importance to develop the advanced lithium-carbon dioxide (Li-CO2) battery with high energy efficiency, yet great challenges remain owing to the sluggish decomposition kinetics of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) discharge products. Herein, we demonstrate a latent cathode catalyst by strategically constructing the heterointerfaces in hollow NiS2/FeS2 nanostructures dispersed on N, S co-doped graphene aerogel (NiS2/FeS2-NSGA), which displays an exceptional capability to enhance the Li2CO3 decomposition rate, thereby remarkably improving the Li-CO2 battery performance. It has been revealed that the functional heterointerfaces can effectively facilitate the electron transfer and tailor the electronic structure of cathode catalyst, and the hierarchical porous architecture provided by NSGA component favors the mass and electrolyte transportation. Consequently, associated with these synergistic merits, the Li-CO2 battery with NiS2/FeS2-NSGA cathode catalyst delivers a significantly reduced discharge–charge overpotential of 1.10 V at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. Moreover, such battery can be stably cycled over 127 cycles at an increased current density of 1 A g−1 and simultaneously exhibits a superb rate capability. These results highlight the significant role of heterointerface active sites in considerably promoting the Li2CO3 decomposition, opening a new avenue to advance the promising Li-CO2 battery technique.",Chemical Engineering Journal
BiOI nanosheets-wrapped carbon fibers as efficient electrocatalyst for bidirectional polysulfide conversion in Li–S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries involve intricate electrochemical processes containing the formation and conversion of polysulfides, in which the shuttle effect and slow reaction kinetics impair its practical performance. Exploring new electrocatalyst with strong catalytic ability can greatly accelerate the conversion of polysulfides in Li-S batteries. Herein, BiOI/carbon fibers (BiOI/CFs) core–shell composite has been prepared by a facile electrospinning combined with solvothermal method and used as a promising electrocatalyst. The BiOI nanosheets are cross-linked to form a porous three-dimensional network on the surface of carbon fibers. This architecture not only has the advantage of large aspect ratio, but also has a high specific surface area, which provides abundant active sites and ensures high electron/ion transfer for the electrocatalysis of lithium polysulfides. As expected, BiOI/CFs electrode presents a superior bidirectional oxidation–reduction ability for polysulfides. The first-principles calculations also prove the strong interaction between BiOI and polysulfides. Due to these advantages, BiOI/CFs can effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides, and possesses excellent electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries. The specific capacity of the BiOI/CFs-S electrode is stable at 1020 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.2C and 598 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5C. This work provides new insights for the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for polysulfide conversion.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Self-supported VN arrays coupled with N-doped carbon nanotubes embedded with Co nanoparticles as a multifunctional sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Rational design and synthesis of advanced sulfur host materials has been regarded as an effective strategy to address the critical challenges of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries including shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), sluggish reaction kinetics, and huge volume change of sulfur. In this work, we demonstrate the rational construction of a multifunctional sulfur host grown on carbon cloth consisting of self-supported porous VN arrays coupled with MOF-derived N-doped carbon nanotubes embedded with tiny Co nanoparticles (named CC/VN/Co@NCNTs). This unique electrode design possesses a series of advantages such as high electrical conductivity, strong physical/chemical confinement of LiPSs, favorable catalytic activity, fast reaction kinetics, effective volumetric accommodation, good mechanical stability and high sulfur loading. As expected, when evaluated as self-standing and binder-free cathode for Li-S batteries, the CC/VN/Co@NCNTs/S exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1130.4 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and maintains 864.1 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, along with outstanding rate performance (625.3 mAh g−1 at 5C) and superior long-term cycling stability with a low capacity decay rate of 0.063% per cycle at 1C for 500 cycles. Moreover, the CC/VN/Co@NCNTs/S delivers high reversible capacities of 847.6, 668.3, and 581.1 mAh g−1 at 0.1C after 100 cycles at different high sulfur loadings of 2.8, 5.2, and 7.8 mg cm−2, respectively.

Hollow N-doped carbon nanoflowers with nanosheets subunits for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The synthesis of economic carbon-based metal-free catalysts with high electroactivity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is still a huge challenge for energy storage and conversion devices. Herein, the hollow N-doped carbon nanoflowers (h-N-CFs) with nanosheets subunits were synthesized by using 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxaldehyde (DABA-BTCO) complex nanoflowers as the self-template and nitrogen resource. Various physical characterizations show that h-N-CFs with hollow and porous architecture have a high surface area (1390.3 m2g−1) and abundant activated N atoms (i.e., graphitic N and pyridinic N). Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that h-N-CFs synthesized at 800 °C can be used as an efficient metal-free ORR catalyst with prominent electroactivity and stability due to hollow architecture, abundant pores, and high N-doping content. Meanwhile, h-N-CFs also show eminent ORR selectivity (i.e., methanol tolerance) in alkaline media, which markedly surpasses benchmark Pt/C catalyst in the presence of methanol.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Bifunctional composite separator with redistributor and anion absorber for dendrites-free and fast-charging lithium metal batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Li metal anode has been considered as “Holy Grail” for next-generation high energy density batteries owing to its extremely high theoretical capacity and low potential. However, the growth of Li dendrites caused by the uneven Li deposition would lead to poor electrochemical performance and batteries safety risks, which seriously hinders the practical applications of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a scalable modification with a PVDF-HFP/Y0.08Zr0.92O2-δ composite coating on commercial polypropylene (PP) separators is proposed for dendrites-free Li metal batteries. The porous PVDF-HFP matrix derived by phase inversion can act as a redistributor to regulate Li+ flux, while the oxygen vacancies in Y0.08Zr0.92O2-δ nanoparticles act as anion absorbers to increase the lithium ion transference number which promotes a homogenous Li deposition and fast-charging capability. The synergetic effects of Li redistributor and anion absorber can make LMBs achieve a high average coulombic efficiency (98.4% over 500 cycles), prolonged life span (over 1000 h) and enhanced rate performance (155 mAh g−1 at 10 C). This work provides a feasible strategy for separator modification (e.g. changing the anion absorber to a polysulfide absorber for lithium sulfur batteries) to construct dendrite-free and fast-charging LMBs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Axial chlorine coordinated iron-nitrogen-carbon single-atom catalysts for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Iron-nitrogen-carbon single-atom catalysts (Fe-N-C SACs) are promising low-cost catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to achieve carbon neutrality. However, their relatively low selectivity and activity are related to the strong binding of reaction intermediates (e.g., CO*) on single Fe atoms. Here, combining experimental and theoretical studies, we show that introducing axial chlorine (Cl) atom can modulate the electronic structure of Fe atoms in catalytically active FeN4 sites, which facilitates the desorption of CO* and inhibits the adsorption of H*, resulting in improved activity and selectivity in CO2RR. The Cl modified Fe-N-C SAC embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (FeN4Cl/NC) was synthesized in two steps: pyrolyzing Fe-loaded two-dimensional zeolite imidazole framework nanosheets and low-temperature incubation in hydrochloric acid solution. X-ray absorption spectroscopy results reveal that most atomically dispersed Fe atoms are coordinated with one axial Cl atom at 2.26 Å and four N atoms at 2.02 Å. The optimized FeN4Cl/NC exhibits a CO Faradaic efficiency of 90.5%, a high current density of 10.8 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of 490 mV, and a high turnover frequency of 1566 h−1, one of the best among recently reported Fe-based CO2RR catalysts. FeN4Cl/NC was further applied as a bifunctional catalyst to construct rechargeable zinc-CO2 batteries, delivering a power density of 0.545 mW cm−2 with excellent stability over 15 h. Tailoring the coordination environment of metal atoms in M-N-C SACs by introducing axial atoms may be further extended as an efficient general approach to design advanced catalysts for various electrochemical applications, such as fuel cells, nitrogen fixation, and lithium-sulfur batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Robust and flexible polymer/MXene-derived two dimensional TiO2 hybrid gel electrolyte for dendrite-free solid-state zinc-ion batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Gel electrolytes are key components for flexible energy storage devices. However, disadvantages such as poor ionic conductivity and mechanical behavior limit the practical applications of gel electrolytes. Herein, two-dimensional TiO2 nanosheets are fabricated from Ti3C2Tx MXene by a one-step hydrothermal reaction. The structure and component of Ti3C2Tx MXene can be easily controlled by modulating the synthesis conditions. Influences of TiO2 nanosheets content in PVA-based gel electrolyte are explored, which brings higher ionic conductivity and better mechanical properties with suitable additive amount. As a consequence, with the hybrid gel electrolyte, highly stable Zn plating/stripping is achieved (over 3000 h at 0.5 mA cm−2). Full Zn||PVA-Zn(CF3SO3)2-TiO2||V2O5 cell shows high capacity (216 mAh g−1 after 115 cycles) and excellent cycling performance.

One-pot synthesis of ZnO quantum dots/N-doped Ti3C2 MXene: Tunable nitrogen-doping properties and efficient electrochemiluminescence sensing,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Nitrogen doping has been proven to be a facile modification strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of 2D MXenes, and thus broaden the potential of MXene-based materials in electrochemistry. Herein, a unique 0D/2D heterostructure of ZnO quantum dots (QDs) decorated nitrogen-doped Ti3C2 MXene (ZnO/N-Ti3C2) with high nitrogen-doping level has been designed and prepared using glycine as N precursor via a facile thermal treatment. During the synthesis process, Ti3C2 MXene matrix acted as an important role to confine the nucleation and growth of ZnO QDs, and thus resulted in the well-dispersed ZnO QDs of 2 ∼ 5 nm on the surface of MXene. Meanwhile, the nitrogen-doping level of Ti3C2 MXene in the composites can be simply tuned from 1.52 wt% to 5.43 wt% by adjusting the amount of glycine. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the increasing doping contents in Ti3C2 MXene could boost the Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) performances, which might be attributed to that more nitrogen contents were beneficial for accelerating electron transfer and decreasing the barrier of ZnO QDs reduction. Remarkably, ECL testing of the ZnO/N-Ti3C2 with 5.43 wt% N revealed that the ECL intensity enhanced by 2.8-fold and the ECL onset potential increased for about 250 mV than those of ZnO QDs/undoped Ti3C2 MXene. By using the resultant ZnO/N-Ti3C2 nanocomposites as an efficient ECL platform, a novel ECL sensor was constructed for sensitive and selective detection of chloramphenicol, which displayed a wide linear range (0.1 ng/mL ∼ 100 ng/mL), a low detection limit (0.019 ng/mL) and high stability.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Highly-dispersed CoS2/N-doped carbon nanoparticles anchored on RGO skeleton as a hierarchical composite counter electrode for quantum dot sensitized solar cells,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Hierarchical nanostructures with tailored components and architectures have attracted widespread interest in improving the performance of electrocatalysts, but the construction of exquisite structures with remarkable electrocatalytic performance is still challenging. Herein, the hierarchical CoS2/NC-RGO composite is designed via a delicate yet facile three-step process, including in-situ growth of ZIF-67, carbonization, and vulcanization. The key preparation step is that GO sheets and the O-20 surfactant are introduced simultaneously into the process of ZIF-67 preparation to obtain the precursor of the hierarchical structure. The composite employed as the counter electrode in the polysulfide electrolyte exhibits a low charge transfer resistance of 1.07 Ω, and the CdS/CdSe co-sensitized quantum dot sensitized solar cell obtains a PCE up to 5.14%. The successive cyclic voltammetry test results prove that it exhibits ultrastrong durability in the polysulfide electrolyte. The excellent performance is mainly due to the well-design of the RGO conductive skeleton and the CS/NC nanoparticles that are uniformly and tightly anchored on the RGO surface. This work provides a new perspective for the preparation of novel and high-efficient hierarchical carbonaceous composite CEs for QDSSCs.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Herein, a nanocomposite consisting of well-dispersed and lamellar-like shape CoS anchored on g-C3N4 nanosheets (CoS@g-C3N4) is prepared firstly, and then it is integrated on a polypropylene membrane combined with little conductive Ketjen black (KB) to fabricate a multifunctional and quite thin interlayer, with a thickness of only ∼ 2.1 um and areal mass loading of ∼ 0.07 mg·cm−2. The as-prepared interlayer firstly can capture polysulfides by Li-N bond as well as Lewis acid-base interaction between CoS and polysulfide anions (Sn2-), and more importantly, it also displays a positive effect on catalyzing the redox conversion of intermediate polysulfides. As expected, a Li-S cell assembled with this modified separator and high sulfur content cathode displays an excellent electrochemical performance, with specific capacity of ∼ 1290 mAh g−1 at 0.2C and a low fading rate of 0.03% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1.0C. Furthermore, a high sulfur mass loading of ∼ 4.0 mg·cm−2 electrode paired with this multifunctional separator exhibits a stable specific capacity of ∼ 600 mAh g−1 after 250 cycles under 0.1C. This work can give some guides to rational design a quite thin and light interlayer for improving the utilization of sulfur species, with little damage to the energy density and Li ion transportation in Li-S batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Towards high-performance lithium-sulfur battery: Investigation on the capability of metalloid to regulate polysulfides,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been a promising rechargeable energy-storage system depending on non-toxicity, low-cost and high theoretical specific capacity. However, the inevitably shuttling of dissolved polysulfides in ether electrolyte and the sluggish redox kinetics still become the obstacles on the way of the commercialization of LSBs. Placing a multifunctional interlayer has been proven a valid method to alleviate the shuttling and boost the conversion of polysulfides. Herein, a germanium (Ge)-doped nitrogen (N)-rich carbon skeleton (GNCS) independent interlayer was proposed through a facile electrospinning technique for LSBs. In this work, Ge nanoparticles, which are embedded in carbon skeleton homogeneously and massively, simultaneously act as catalysts and absorbents for their inherent electronic conductivity and reliable affinity to polysulfides. Meanwhile, the polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-derived nitrogen-rich carbon nanofibers build a three-dimensional conductive network for expediting electron transportation of the entire system. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSBs using GNCS interlayers exhibit superior rate performance with the ultrahigh initial capacity of 1680.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, as well as a decent long-cycling performance with high capacity of 755.6 mAh g−1 after 300 cycling at 1C. This design could not only widen horizons on the usage of metalloids nanoparticles to mediate the activity of polysulfides, but also introduce a facile and practical electrospinning strategy to produce the novel interlayers for realizing the industrialization of LSBs.",Chemical Engineering Journal

In the current work, COF-SQ-Ph was synthesized through the aza-Diels-Alder reaction between phenylacetylene and the matrix COF-SQ (triazine-based COF) generated from the organic monomers 2, 4, 6-tris(4-aminophenyl)-1, 3, 5-triazine and 2, 5-dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde in flask. The functionalized COF-SQ-Ph with an extended π-conjugated structure and enhanced structural stability was used as the sulfur loading recipient to prepare sulfur cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries. Sulfur-impregnated COF-SQ-Ph marked as COF-SQ-Ph-S displayed better cycling stability with a specific capacity of 618 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles due to the lithiophilic interaction between lithium polysulfides and nitrogen atoms from quinoline and triazine moieties in COF-SQ-Ph-S. The functionalization of triazine-based COFs through a cycloaddition reaction in flask could promote the large-scale preparation of tailored COFs and the post-synthesis modification of COF-SQ.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

The results of both DFT calculation and experimental characterization show that C atoms can not be replaced by Eu3+, but C atoms are more favorable for anchoring Eu3+ single-atoms. The CQDs modified by N or N/Eu3+ showed enhanced luminescence intensity. The work function, optical properties, and charge density difference were calculated. The obtained CQDs-N:Eu3+@MOF-Ln3+ composites not only have high thermal stability (up to 510 °C), but also can emit multi-color tunable emissions. Importantly, the white light emission from CQDs-N:Eu3+@MOF-Ln3+ single phosphor with excellent color quality, favorable visual performance, and adjustable color temperature can be obtained by optimizing CQDs-N:Eu3+@MOF-Ln3+.

Ultra-lightweight ion-sieving membranes for high-rate lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is impeded by the shuttle effect of intermediate polysulfides and the inherent sluggish kinetics. Herein, Mo2C nanocatalysts anchoring on holey graphene scaffold (Mo2C@HGr) is explored as a lightweight and ultrathin modified separator to conquer the above issues. The artificially customized holes on holey graphene sheets facilitate ionic transfer and electrolyte penetration, and further enhance the sulfur utilization under lean electrolyte conditions. The experimental results together with theoretic calculation demonstrate the favourable chemical adsorption ability of Mo2C sites that blocking the diffusion of LiPSs. Abundant triple-phase interfaces among Mo2C nanomediators, holey graphene and electrolyte boost the conversion kinetics of the intercepted LiPSs. As a result, the cell with Mo2C@HGr modified separator shows superior rate capability (836 mAh g−1) even at 5 C current with a negligible Mo2C@HGr loading of 0.08 mg cm−2.

The N/P-co-doped Octahedron carbon matrix improves the conductivity of Cu3P and moderates the volume expansion during the lithiation/delithiation process. Meanwhile, the interaction between the Cu3P and the doped carbon matrix is methodically explored by using density functional theory (DFT). Through the analysis of the partial charge density, the density of states and the Bader charge, and the calculation results verify the correctness of the experimental observation results, that is, Cu3P@NPC has good electrochemical performance.

Mechanistic insights for electrochemical reduction of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels over O-terminated MXenes,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryTwo-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) have attracted intensive attention for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into renewable fuels and chemical feedstock. Although encouraging progress has been made so far, many advances are still needed to understand and clarify the CO2RR mechanism over functionalized MXenes. In this regard, we present the promising selective conversion capabilities of group IV (Ti2X and Zr2X; X = C, N or B) MXenes with O-termination for catalyzing the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to methane (CH4). The unique CO2RR behavior observed on O-terminated MXenes is mainly due to the choice of *HCOOH pathway, where the majority of electrocatalytic CO2 reductions prefer the ubiquitous *CO intermediates. The proposed reliable scaling relationships demonstrate better coordination between the reaction intermediates and binding energies of *COOH/*HCOOH, thereby indicating its importance as a key descriptor to assess the catalytic performance of O-terminated MXenes. The catalytic selectivity for the CO2RR is higher than HER, indicating that the selectivity between them is crucial and depends on the efficiency of the catalyst. Our theoretical findings provide useful insight and opportunities to develop advanced MXene based catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction into valuable chemicals and fuels.",Catalysis Science and Technology

Confinement synthesis in porous molecule-based materials: a new opportunity for ultrafine nanostructures,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.A balance between activity and stability is greatly challenging in designing efficient metal nanoparticles (MNPs) for heterogeneous catalysis. Generally, reducing the size of MNPs to the atomic scale can provide high atom utilization, abundant active sites, and special electronic/band structures, for vastly enhancing their catalytic activity. Nevertheless, due to the dramatically increased surface free energy, such ultrafine nanostructures often suffer from severe aggregation and/or structural degradation during synthesis and catalysis, greatly weakening their reactivities, selectivities and stabilities. Porous molecule-based materials (PMMs), mainly including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs) or cages (POCs), exhibit high specific surface areas, high porosity, and tunable molecular confined space, being promising carriers or precursors to construct ultrafine nanostructures. The confinement effects of their nano/sub-nanopores or specific binding sites can not only effectively limit the agglomeration and growth of MNPs during reduction or pyrolysis processes, but also stabilize the resultant ultrafine nanostructures and modulate their electronic structures and stereochemistry in catalysis. In this review, we highlight the latest advancements in the confinement synthesis in PMMs for constructing atomic-scale nanostructures, such as ultrafine MNPs, nanoclusters, and single atoms. Firstly, we illustrated the typical confinement methods for synthesis. Secondly, we discussed different confinement strategies, including PMM-confinement strategy and PMM-confinement pyrolysis strategy, for synthesizing ultrafine nanostructures.

There are rarely works on the direct confirmation of confinement effects because of restrictions of nanoscale confined space. Herein, we report the fabrication of a novel structure that is composed of NiO nanoparticles confined in SnO2 nanocoils (I-NiSnNCs) via atomic layer deposition (ALD). The I-NiSnNCs displayed higher sensing performance towards hydrogen than the NiO-SnO2 film, NiO outside NiSnNC and NiO both outside and inside NiSnNC sensors. The I-NiSnNC sensor shows a response to about 7 to 50 ppm H2 with a 2.4 s response time and 4.2 s recovery time at 260 °C and excellent repeatability. The synergistic effect of interfacial sites is attributed to the reaction between adsorbed H on NiO and adsorbed O at interfacial active sites. The ""funneling effect""formed because the enrichment effect of hydrogen on the NiO surface is higher than that of the gas state as the adsorbed H quickly reacts at interfacial active sites. The enrichment effects of H2 lead to high sensing performance to H2, and the high reactivity of H2 at interfacial active sites leading to rapid transfer of electrons is responsible for the high response/recovery performance. The gas sensor offers a new way to directly confirm the confinement effect. And the confinement effects in return give a novel way to design sensing materials.

V2CT: X catalyzes polysulfide conversion to enhance the redox kinetics of Li-S batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have the potential to become the future energy storage system, yet they are plagued by sluggish redox kinetics. Therefore, enhancing the redox kinetics of polysulfides is key for the development of high-energy density and long-life Li-S batteries. Herein, a Ketjen Black (KB)/V2CTX modified separator (KB/V2CTX-PP) based on the catalytic effect in continuous solid-to-liquid-to-solid reactions is proposed to accelerate the conversion of sulfur species during the charge/discharge process in which the V2CTX can enhance the redox kinetics and inhibit polysulfide shuttling. The cells assembled with KB/V2CTX-PP achieve a gratifying first discharge capacity of 1236.1 mA h g-1 at 0.2C and the average capacity decay per cycle reaches 0.049% within 1000 cycles at 1C. The work provides an efficient idea to accelerate redox conversion and suppress shuttle effects by designing a multifunctional catalytic separator. This journal is",Dalton Transactions
Cobalt Nanocluster-Decorated N-Rich Hierarchical Carbon Architectures Efficiently Catalyze Oxygen Reduction and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Cucurbit[6]uril (Q[6]) assemblies were fabricated into N-rich hierarchical carbon architectures decorated with cobalt nanoclusters (Co-NHCs) for electrocatalyzing oxygen reduction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). The new template-free method based on mechanochemical synthesis acquires holey N-doped matrixes with hierarchically layered structures, micro/mesopores, and higher cobalt loadings as nanoclusters. The synergistic effect within Co-NHCs leads to excellent electrocatalytic activity, showing durable and stable ORR properties with a positive half-wave potential of 0.90 V vs RHE, as well as high stability for HER, exhibiting a low overpotential of 143 mV in the case of 10 mA cm-2 current density in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, comparing with those of Pt/C, Co-NHC catalysts offer Zn-air batteries with higher power density and energy density and better stability. This work discloses a promising strategy for making stable and highly efficient catalysts for both ORR and HER in long-life electrochemical storage devices.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
Two-dimensional Dirac half-metal in porous carbon nitride C6N7monolayer via atomic doping,"© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of C6N7 monolayer (Zhao et al 2021 Science Bulletin 66, 1764), we show that C6N7 monolayer co-doped with C atom is a Dirac half-metal by employing first-principle density functional theory calculations. The structural, mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties of the co-doped C6N7 are investigated by both the PBE and HSE06 functionals. Pristine C6N7 monolayer is a semiconductor with almost isotropic electronic dispersion around the Γ point. As the doping of the C6N7 takes place, the substitution of an N atom with a C atom transforms the monolayer into a dilute magnetic semiconductor, with the spin-up channel showing a band gap of 2.3 eV, while the spin-down channel exhibits a semimetallic phase with multiple Dirac points. The thermodynamic stability of the system is also checked out via AIMD simulations, showing the monolayer to be free of distortion at 500 K. The emergence of Dirac half-metal in carbon nitride monolayer via atomic doping reveals an exciting material platform for designing novel nanoelectronics and spintronics devices.",Nanotechnology
Metal coordination in C2N-like materials towards dual atom catalysts for oxygen reduction,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Single-atom catalysts, in particular the Fe-N-C family of materials, have emerged as a promising alternative to platinum group metals in fuel cells as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. Numerous theoretical studies have suggested that dual atom catalysts can appreciably accelerate catalytic reactions; nevertheless, the synthesis of these materials is highly challenging owing to metal atom clustering and aggregation into nanoparticles during high temperature synthesis treatment. In this work, dual metal atom catalysts are prepared by controlled post synthetic metal-coordination in a C2N-like material. The configuration of the active sites was confirmed by means of X-ray adsorption spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. During oxygen reduction, the catalyst exhibited an activity of 2.4 ± 0.3 A gcarbon−1 at 0.8 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode in acidic media, comparable to the most active in the literature.

MOF-Derived Potassiophilic CuO Nanoparticles on Carbon Fiber Cloth as Host for Stabilizing Potassium Metal Anode,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHPotassium (K) metal anodes suffer the main obstacle of uncontrollable dendrite growth. One of the best ways to overcome this challenge is to build a stable potassiophilic host. Herein, we designed a Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF)-derived CuO nanoparticles on carbon fiber cloth (CC) as a high potassiophilic host to prestore molten potassium for dendrite-free K metal anode. The three-dimensional host has a relatively large surface area and excellent mechanical strength, which helps to lower the local current density as well as buffer the volume expansion during the plating/stripping of K. The highly potassiophilic CuO nanoparticles could provide abundant nucleation sites for K, thereby guiding uniform K deposition with a low nucleation overpotential and inhibits the growth of dendrites. The CC@CuO@K anode could cycle for 2000 h at a current of 0.5 mA cm−2, which exceeds K metal anodes mentioned in other reports. Last but not least, by using the composite K metal as the anode to assemble the full cell, highly boosted performance can be achieved. Our result provides a tempting method for realizing dendrite-free K metal anodes in PIBs, and also provides an opportunity for the application of other MOF-based materials in the field of high-performance K metal anodes.",ChemElectroChem
ZIF-67 Derived Hollow Co9S8 as an Efficient Polysulfides Prohibitor for High Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHLithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have received great attention due to their large energy density and specific capacity. Unfortunately, the poor cycle stability due to the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides seriously impedes the application of LSBs. In order to solve this problem, we report the synthesis of ZIF-67 derived hollow Co9S8 which is coated on the commercial separator for LSBs through a self-template strategy. The hollow structure Co9S8 can capture a large amount of polysulfides during cycling, and the polar Co9S8 can chemically adsorb and catalyze the reaction intermediate, greatly reducing the migration of polysulfides. As a result, the hollow Co9S8 modified separator exhibits good rate performance and remains a capacity of 540.5 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 C as the sulfur area density of 3.0 mg cm−2. Even when the sulfur area density is increased to 5.0 mg cm−2, the battery using hollow Co9S8 modified separator still exhibits good cycle property.",ChemElectroChem

Herein, one-dimensional polycrystalline nanoneedles composed of CoO−Co9S8 nano heterostructures, in situ grown on carbon fiber paper are prepared for efficient overall water electrolysis. Due to strong electronic coupling, charge densities of Co2+/Co3+ in Co9S8 and Co2+ in CoO are favorably modified at the interface of CoO and Co9S8, resulting in optimized reaction intermediates absorption and greatly enhanced bifunctional HER/OER activities. CoO−Co9S8/CFP delivers a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline electrolyte at overpotentials of 184 mV and 270 mV for HER and OER, respectively. When used as electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, it needs a low cell potential of 1.66 V to realize water electrolysis at 10 mA cm−2.

Covalently Grafting Sulfur-Containing Polymers to Carbon Nanotubes Enhances the Electrochemical Performance of Sulfur Cathodes,"© Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted extensive attention due to the high theoretical specific capacity of sulfur (1675 mA h g-1). Despite the advantage, the utility of Li-S batteries is limited by the low electrical conductivities of sulfur and its discharge products (i.e., Li2S2 and Li2S) as well as the ""shuttle effect""of polysulfides. Herein, a strategy of covalently grafting sulfur-containing polymers to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is proposed as a solution to the problems associated with sulfur cathodes. The sulfur-containing polymers are grafted to the CNTs using an ""inverse vulcanization""method, wherein elemental sulfur is reacted with CNTs that are previously functionalized with isopropenyl groups. A morphological study of the resulting composite indicates that the material maintains the one-dimensional characteristic of CNTs and effectively establishes a porous network via overlap. Such structural features are found to facilitate electron transport in the composite and also suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides. When compared to cells that are prepared from elemental sulfur, devices that contain the composite show improved specific capacity (i.e., 1368 mA h g-1 at 0.05 C) and a suppressed capacity fading rate (i.e., 0.074% per cycle at 1 C over 500 cycles). In a broader context, covalently attaching sulfur-containing polymers to CNTs provides design criteria for realizing cathode materials that may be employed in high-performance Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Polymer Materials

Energy-Saving Synthesis of Functional CoS2/rGO Interlayer With Enhanced Conversion Kinetics for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2022 Feng, Li, Yuan, Zhao, Zhang, Wang, Tang and Song.Lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery has exhibited great application potential in next-generation high-density secondary battery systems due to their excellent energy density and high specific capacity. However, the practical industrialization of Li-S battery is still affected by the low conductivity of sulfur and its discharge product (Li2S2/Li2S), the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide (Li2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) during charging/discharging process and so on. Here, cobalt disulfide/reduced graphene oxide (CoS2/rGO) composites were easily and efficiently prepared through an energy-saving microwave-assisted hydrothermal method and employed as functional interlayer on commercial polypropylene separator to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li-S battery. As a physical barrier and second current collector, the porous conductive rGO can relieve the shuttle effect of polysulfides and ensure fast electron/ion transfer. Polar CoS2 nanoparticles uniformly distributed on rGO provide strong chemical adsorption to capture polysulfides. Benefitting from the synergy of physical and chemical constraints on polysulfides, the Li-S battery with CoS2/rGO functional separator exhibits enhanced conversion kinetics and excellent electrochemical performance with a high cycling initial capacity of 1,122.3 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, good rate capabilities with 583.9 mAh g−1 at 2 C, and long-term cycle stability (decay rate of 0.08% per cycle at 0.5 C).

N-doped interconnected porous graphene as advanced electrode material for supercapacitors,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Developing low-cost and highly effective electrode materials is crucial for advanced supercapacitors. In this work, N-doped graphene with an interconnected porous structure is prepared with a solvothermal method combined with freeze-drying. The hierarchical porous structure with a large specific surface area (291.3 m2 g−1) and high total pore volume (0.418 cm3 g−1) offers many adsorption sites and fast transfer channels for electrolyte ions, enhancing the supercapacitive performance. Also, the intrinsic oxygen and the doped nitrogen (9.95 at%)-based functional groups increase the hydrophilicity of the as-prepared electrode material and provide the additional pseudo-capacitance, further improving the supercapacitive behavior. Under the present conditions, the optimal graphene (denoted as hp-NGR-1.0), which is fabricated by using 1.0 mL of tetraethoxysilane, possesses a specific capacitance of 328.5 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 in the three-electrode device, and the corresponding symmetric configuration displays an energy density of 31.2 Wh kg−1 at 400 W kg−1, which is superior to many previous results.

Modular assembly of electron transfer pathways in bimetallic MOFs for photocatalytic ammonia synthesis,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryIt is a long-term pursuit to implement the green and sustainable photocatalytic production of ammonia via the conversion of water and nitrogen under mild conditions. Due to the rapid recombination of photoexcited carriers and competitive reaction of hydrogen evolution, how to effectively utilize the electrons in the photocatalytic procedure becomes a key issue to achieve high photocatalytic N2 reduction. In this study, electron pathway engineering (EPE) is proposed to regulate the electron transfer and utilization by using the stable amino-functionalized UiO-66 with bimetallic Ce-Hf nodes (NU6(Ce-Hf)) as the photocatalysts. The photocatalytic results confirm that the sample with the Ce : Hf molar ratio exhibits optimal performance (158.4 μmol g−1 h−1), which is ascribed to the electron transfer efficiency promoted by the electron buffering effect of Ce species and the selective adsorption ability of Hf species for nitrogen molecules. In addition, the selectivity of the nitrogen fixation reaction is approximately up to 100%, which is attributed to the inhibition of hydrogen evolution reaction by Hf species. This study may offer some inspirations to realize the effective transfer and utilization of electrons for photocatalytic materials.",Catalysis Science and Technology
Regulating lithium deposition behavior by electrokinetic effects in a high-zeta-potential h-BN/zinc-lithium alloy for high-performance lithium metal anodes,"© 2022 Royal Society of Chemistry. All rights reserved.The commercial application of lithium metal anodes is impeded by the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites and the serious volume change during the cycling process. Here we develop a high-zeta-potential h-BN-doped zinc-lithium alloy (Li-ZB) as an anode to self-drive electrokinetic effects and regulate the lithium deposition behavior to achieve high-performance lithium metal batteries. The high-zeta-potential h-BN in Li-ZB promotes electrokinetic surface conduction and electroosmosis within the porous Zn-BN framework formed after lithium stripping, which in turn greatly enhances lithium-ion transport kinetics. Uniform Zn distribution in Li-ZB enables homogenous lithium nucleation and a reduced nucleation barrier. The synergistic effect of electrokinetic effect enhanced lithium-ion transport and regulated lithium nucleation behavior effectively suppresses lithium dendrite growth and mitigates the volume change issue at high deposition capacities (8 mA h cm-2), high current densities (10 mA cm-2), and a high rate (5C). The Li-ZB‖LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells exhibit excellent cycling stability and capacity retention, as well as significantly enhanced CE, even under lean-electrolyte conditions (e.g., 3 μL mA h-1).

"Modulation of Water Dissociation Kinetics with a ""breathable"" Wooden Electrode for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution","© 2022 American Chemical Society.Innovative breakthroughs regarding self-supported open and porous electrodes that can promote gas-liquid transmission and regulate the water dissociation kinetics are critical for sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, a free-standing porous electrode with Pd-NiS nanoparticles assembled in a multichannel carbonized wood framework (Pd-NiS/CW) was ingeniously constructed. Specifically, carbonized wood (CW) with a mass of open microchannels and high electrical conductivity can significantly facilitate electrolyte permeation (""inhalation""), hydrogen evolution (""exhalation""), and electron transfer.

TiH2Nanodots Exfoliated via Facile Sonication as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Li-S Batteries,"© Mediating the redox kinetics of polysulfides is a promising strategy to mitigate the shuttling and sluggish conversion of polysulfides for practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, novel TiH2 nanodots (THNDs) fabricated by sonication-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation are used as bifunctional electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries. Both experimental and theoretical results reveal that THNDs can not only provide a strong chemical affinity to polysulfides but also bidirectionally promote the precipitation/decomposition of Li2S from/to polysulfides during the discharge/charge process, thus effectively suppressing the shuttle effect and improving the redox kinetics of polysulfides. Owing to these advantages accompanied by the abundant catalytically active sites of THNDs, the assembled Li-S batteries deliver a low capacity fading rate of 0.055% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1C and a high areal capacity of 5.38 mAh cm-2 after 50 cycles with a high sulfur loading of 8.5 mg cm-2. This work demonstrates the great potential of utilizing functional metal hydrides as effective electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries, which will incite more investigation into the specific selection of metal compounds to boost the redox kinetics of polysulfides.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Toward Theoretical Capacity and Superhigh Power Density for Potassium-Selenium Batteries via Facilitating Reversible Potassiation Kinetics,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Potassium-selenium (K-Se) batteries attract tremendous attention because of the two-electron transfer of the selenium cathode. Nonetheless, practical K-Se cells normally display selenium underutilization and unsatisfactory rate capability. Herein, we employ a synergistic spatial confinement and architecture engineering strategy to establish selenium cathodes for probing the effect of K+ diffusion kinetics on K-Se battery performance and improving the charge transfer efficiency at ultrahigh rates. By impregnating selenium into hollow and solid carbon spheres with similar diameters and porous structures, the obtained parallel Se/C composites possess nearly identical selenium loadings, molecular structures, and heterogeneous interfaces but enormously different paths for K+ diffusion. Remarkably, as the solid-state K+ diffusion distance is significantly reduced, the K-Se cell achieves 96% of 2e- transfer capacity (647.1 mA h g-1). Reversible capacities of 283.5 and 224.1 mA h g-1 are obtained at 7.5 and 15C, respectively, corresponding to an unprecedented high power density of 8777.8 W kg-1. Quantitative kinetic analysis demonstrated a twofold higher capacitive charge storage contribution and a 1 order of magnitude higher K+ diffusion coefficient due to the short K+ diffusion path. By combining the determination of potassiation products by ex situ characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is identified that the kinetic factor is decisive for K-Se battery performances.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Investigation of vacancy defects and substitutional doping in AlSb monolayer with double layer honeycomb structure: A first-principles calculation,"© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.The experimental knowledge of the AlSb monolayer with double layer honeycomb structure is largely based on the recent publication (Le Qin et al 2021 ACS Nano 15 8184), where this monolayer was recently synthesized. Therefore, the aim of our research is to consequently explore the effects of substitutional doping and vacancy point defects on the electronic and magnetic properties of the novel hexagonal AlSb monolayer. Besides experimental reports, the phonon band structure and cohesive energy calculations confirm the stability of the AlSb monolayer. Its direct bandgap has been estimated to be 0.9 eV via the hybrid functional method, which is smaller than the value of 1.6 eV of bulk material. The majority of vacancy defects and substitutional dopants change the electronic properties of the AlSb monolayer from semiconducting to metallic. Moreover, the MgSb impurity has demonstrated the addition of ferromagnetic behavior to the material. It is revealed through the calculation of formation energy that in Al-rich conditions, the vacant site of VSb is the most stable, while in Sb-rich circumstances the point defect of VAl gets the title. The formation energy has also been calculated for the substitutional dopants, showing relative stability of the defected structures.

The electrocatalysts are critical to enhance the efficiency of metal-air cells and fuel cells. In this study, a one-pot vapor deposition method was used to realize the synchronously dope of N and Ni (trace) into Co/C to form Co–Ni (trace)/N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co–Ni (trace)/NCNTs). An interesting result is that injecting dicyandiamide (DCD) into Ni foam as a precursor led to the in situ formation of NCNTs, with synchronous doping of trace Ni into Co species. The cooperative effects of the Co–Ni (trace) and N-doped carbon nanotubes resulted in superior dual-functional electrocatalytic performance of Co–Ni (trace)/NCNTs for the ORR (half-wave potential E1/2 vs. RHE: 0.83 V, electron transfer number n: 3.97) and OER (overpotential vs. RHE: 337 mV at 10 mA cm−2, Tafel slope: 94.0 mV dec−1).

In the plethora of organic linkers, quinone derivatives are excellent redox-active ligands, widely used for various applications such as electrode materials, flow batteries, pseudocapacitors, etc. Benzoquinones undergo a one-electron reversible reduction to form a semiquinone radical species that can be further reduced to form hydroquinone.

Graphene-based materials as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction: A review,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The continuous depletion of fossil fuels makes it necessary to find out an appropriate alternative energy sources to fulfill the global energy requirement. During this search, it has been observed that 'hydrogen' with a specific energy density value of 142 kJ mol-1 can play an important role. Electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the ways to generate pure hydrogen by forming water molecules as an impurity. Electrocatalytic water splitting consists of two half-cell reactions, i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Noble metal oxides (RuO2 and IrO2) and Pt metal are considered the state-of-art electrocatalysts for the OER and HER, respectively. However, the high cost and low abundance of these noble metal-based electrocatalysts have motivated the development of alternative electrocatalysts for the practical large-scale generation of hydrogen. Recently, various derivatives of transition metals have been considered as effective and low-cost alternatives to noble metal-based electrocatalysts. However, although various transition metal-based electrocatalysts have been reported thus far to exhibit excellent OER and HER activity, their low conductivity and marginal stability under static conditions require their modification to achieve better stability. Recently, the synthesis of graphene composites with transition metal-based electrocatalysts has gain an increased attention due to their excellent conductivity and stability with excellent hydrogen generation. Here, in this review, for the first time, we have discuss the recent development of various graphene-based composites of transition metals for the water splitting reaction. In addition, the current challenges and opportunities in this field will be discussed elaborately with an extensive future outlook. This journal is",Sustainable Energy and Fuels
Designing porous and stable Au-coated Ni nanosheets on Ni foam for quasi-symmetrical polymer Li-air batteries,"© the Partner Organisations.Li-air cells have aroused intense interest because of their ultra-high specific energies, but their practical application is still hindered by many problems, such as the slurry reaction kinetics and serious parasitic reactions at the cathode, obvious liquid electrolyte decomposition/leakage, and passivation/pulverization issues at the anode. Herein, Au-nanoparticle-coated Ni nanosheets grown on Ni foam (Au/NNS-NF) were first fabricated and then reacted with molten Li to form Li-based Au/NNS-NF (Li@Au/NNS-NF), which was applied as an electrode in quasi-symmetrical Li-air cells in which a poly(methyl methacrylate)-based electrolyte is used. Due to the porous/stable framework, good conductivity, and uniform Au coating layer, Au/NNS-NF cathodes possess excellent ORR/OER properties and inhibit parasitic reactions in Li-air batteries, while the Li@Au/NNS-NF anodes exhibit superior lithiophilicity, reducing dendritic Li formation and electrode dimension changes. A Li@Au/NNS-NF-based symmetric battery exhibits an excellent lifespan beyond 1100 cycles at 1 mA cm-2 and small overpotentials (∼20 mV), while the Au/NNS-NF cathode also shows better performance than a carbon electrode. Additionally, the polymer electrolyte possesses good stability and is leakproof, offering superior anode protection. Therefore, a quasi-symmetrical Au/NNS-NF-based polymer Li-air battery shows a large capacity of 13 764.2 mA h g-1 at 500 mA g-1 and long cycling life (150 cycles) with low overpotentials (<2 V), and corresponding soft-package cells also present excellent properties under bending and can even drive many devices.

Here, we report a safe, practical and eco-friendly electrochemical methodology for the controllable dechloro-coupling of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) with thiols, providing value-added β-chloroethylsulfurs, which serve as versatile building blocks in the efficient late-stage conversion to bioactive molecules.

"N, S-doped graphene derived from graphene oxide and thiourea-formaldehyde resin for high stability lithium-sulfur batteries","© the Owner Societies.Although lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with a high theoretical energy density and low cost have attracted extensive research attention, their commercialization is still unsuccessful due to the poor cycle life caused by the dissolution of polysulfides. It is the key challenge to overcome polysulfide shuttling for achieving long-term cycling stability in Li-S batteries. Here we report a novel strategy for the synthesis of N, S-doped graphene with high nitrogen and sulfur contents via in situ self-assembly of graphene oxide and thiourea-formaldehyde resin and calcination. The N, S-doped graphene serves as a conductive agent and a chemosorbent for suppressing polysulfide shuttling and preventing the Li-metal from corrosion, leading to a high reversible capacity and superior cycling stability. The Li-S batteries with the N, S-doped graphene can achieve an excellent cycling life (622 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 1C) and a slow capacity decay rate (0.049% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1C). The proposed strategy has the potential to enhance the high electrochemical properties of Li-S batteries.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Single-Ion Lithium Conducting Polymers with High Ionic Conductivity Based on Borate Pendant Groups,"© 2021 The Authors. Angewandte Chemie International Edition published by Wiley-VCH GmbHA family of single-ion lithium conducting polymer electrolytes based on highly delocalized borate groups is reported. The effect of the nature of the substituents on the boron atom on the ionic conductivity of the resultant methacrylic polymers was analyzed. To the best of our knowledge the lithium borate polymers endowed with flexible and electron-withdrawing substituents presents the highest ionic conductivity reported for a lithium single-ion conducting homopolymer (1.65×10−4 S cm−1 at 60 °C). This together with its high lithium transference number t (Formula presented.) =0.93 and electrochemical stability window of 4.2 V vs Li0/Li+ show promise for application in lithium batteries. To illustrate this, a lithium borate monomer was integrated into a single-ion gel polymer electrolyte which showed good performance on lithium symmetrical cells (<0.85 V at ±0.2 mA cm−2 for 175 h).",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
WSe2 Flakelets on N-Doped Graphene for Accelerating Polysulfide Redox and Regulating Li Plating,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe practical application of lithium–sulfur batteries is still limited by the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling effect on the S cathode and uncontrollable Li-dendrite growth on the Li anode. Herein, elaborately designed WSe2 flakelets immobilized on N-doped graphene (WSe2/NG) with abundant active sites are employed to be a dual-functional host for satisfying both the S cathode and Li anode synchronously. On the S cathode, the WSe2/NG with a strong interaction towards LiPSs can act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of LiPSs. On the Li anode, the WSe2/NG with excellent lithiophilic features can regulate the uniform Li plating/stripping to mitigate the growth of Li dendrite. Taking advantage of these merits, the assembled Li−S full batteries exhibit remarkable rate performance and stable cycling stability even at a higher sulfur loading of 10.5 mg cm−2 with a negative to positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio of 1.4 : 1.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition

However, the ionic conductivity of traditional inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) is always unsatisfactory owing to the grain boundary resistance and large thickness. Here, a 13 μm-thick laminar framework with ≈1.3 nm interlayer channels is fabricated by self-assembling rigid, hydrophilic vermiculite (Vr) nanosheets. Then, Li0.33La0.557TiO3 (LLTO) precursors are impregnated in interlayer channels and afterwards in situ sintered to large-size, oriented, and defect-free LLTO crystal. We demonstrate that the confinement effect permits ordered arrangement of LLTO crystal along the c-axis (the fastest Li+ transfer direction), permitting the resultant 15 μm-thick Vr-LLTO electrolyte an ionic conductivity of 8.22×10−5 S cm−1 and conductance of 87.2 mS at 30 °C. These values are several times’ higher than that of traditional LLTO-based electrolytes. Moreover, Vr-LLTO electrolyte has a compressive modulus of 1.24 GPa.

Here, an efficient ORR electrocatalyst consists of Co, Ni co-decorated nitrogen-doped double shell hollow carbon cage (Ni-Co@NHC) was fabricated by pyrolyzing Ni-doped polydopamine wrapped ZIF-67. During the preparation, polydopamine served as a protective layer can effectively prevent the aggregation of Co and Ni nanoparticles during the pyrolysis process, and at the same time forming a carbon layer to grow a double layer carbon cage. This unique hollow structure endows the catalyst with a high specific surface area as well as more exposed active sites. Also benefited from the synergistic effect between Ni and Co nanoparticles, the Ni-Co@NHC catalyst leads to an outstanding ORR performance of half-wave potential (E 1/2, 0.862 V), outperforms that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. Additionally, when Ni-Co@NHC was used in the cathode for the zinc-air battery, the cell exhibits high power density (108 mW cm-2) and high specific capacity (806 mAh g-1) at 20 mA cm-2 outperforming Pt/C.

Layered tungsten-based composites and their pseudocapacitive and electrocatalytic performance†,"This journal is © the Partner OrganisationsWith the rapid development of heterostructured electrocatalysts, the potential application of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)-based composites for electrocatalysis have attracted intense attraction owing to their unique optical, electronic, and mechanical properties. Herein, a facile solvothermal method to obtain heterostructured composites consisting of TMD (WS2) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is reported. DFT calculation results demonstrates that the interface interaction between g-C3N4 and WS2 optimizes the electronic structure of composite materials and activates the active sites. The WS2-g-C3N4 composites with surface sulfur and nitrogen vacancies exhibit high specific capacitance of 1156 F g−1 and excellent cycling stability with no capacitance loss over 2000 charge-discharge cycles, demonstrating huge potential in applications for pseudocapacitive energy storage.

In situ integration of cobalt diselenide nanoparticles on CNTs realizing durable hydrogen evolution,"This journal is © The Royal Society of ChemistryCobalt diselenide (CoSe2) is considered to be a promising economical and efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were employed as a conductive skeleton to optimize the electrocatalytic performance of CoSe2 through a simple one-step hydrothermal method. Beyond the expected, the introduction of CNTs not only accelerates electron transportation and ion diffusion, but also improves the reaction kinetics for HER by forming a CoSe2/CNT heterointerface. Consequently, the CoSe2/CNTs composite exhibits an optimal overpotential of 153 mV with a weight ratio of 10 : 1, and sustains a long period of 48 hours with an negligible overpotential deterioration. In addition, a Faraday efficiency of 97.67% is achieved with a H2/O2 molar ratio of 2 : 1. Therefore, these results open up further opportunities for yielding efficient and durable hydrogen evolving electrocatalysts from low-cost transition metal compounds.",RSC Advances
"A spatially efficient ""tube-in-tube"" hybrid for durable sulfur electrochemistry","© 2022 Royal Society of Chemistry. All rights reserved.The structural modification of sulfur hosts, which involves tailorable structural designability, superior porous architecture, and administrable catalytic modifiability, is essential to overcome the current obstacles (insufficient utilization rate and precarious cell cycling) facing lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs). Hence, a spatially efficient ""tube-in-tube"" carbonaceous host decorated with defective metallic nitride nanoparticles (Fe2N1-x-NCT25) is constructed and validated to alleviate the abovementioned problems via constructing a highly utilized/volumetric-stabilized sulfur host with multiple electrical/ionic conductive channels. Owing to the presence of spatial confinement and durable catalyzed capability afforded by the as-fabricated hierarchical host, the sulfur cathode delivers a high reversible discharge capacity of 808 mA h g-1under the conditions of 1C rate with 90 wt% sulfur content. In addition, a high areal capacity of 5.26 mA h cm-2, a superb cyclability of 100 cycles and an ultra-low capacity fading rate of 0.013% per cycle are observed at 1C. The reliable LiPS adsorption and administrable LiPS shuttling effect are attributed to the well-developed interactions/conversion between the LiPSs and defective metallic nitride particles, which was further confirmed by theoretical calculations. This work affords the synergistic construction of a structural carbonaceous host for sulfur utilization and an anchored defective catalyst towards rapid and reliable sulfur electrochemistry, leading to enormous prospects in developing applicable LSBs.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Heterogeneous Bimetallic Organic Coordination Polymer-Derived Co/Fe@NC Bifunctional Catalysts for Rechargeable Li-O2Batteries,"© The Li-O2 battery has attracted substantial attention due to its high theoretical energy density. In particular, high-efficiency oxygen catalysts are very important for the design of practical Li-O2 batteries. Herein, we have synthesized heterogeneous crystalline-coated partially crystalline bimetallic organic coordination polymers (PC@C-BMOCPs), which are further pyrolyzed to obtain Co- and Fe-based nanoparticles embedded within rodlike N-doped carbon (Co/Fe@NC) as a bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) catalyst used in the Li-O2 battery. Owing to excellent ORR/OER catalytic ability, the Co/Fe@NC bifunctional catalyst exhibits an efficient reversible reaction between O2 and Li2O2. Additionally, a large number of mesoporous channels are present in the core-shell Co/Fe@NC nanoparticles. These channels not only promote the diffusion of Li+ and O2, but also create ample room to store insoluble discharge product Li2O2. The Li-O2 batteries utilizing the bifunctional Co/Fe@NC oxygen electrode exhibit a large capacity of 17,326 mAh g-1, a long cycling life of more than 250 cycles, and excellent reversibility.

Solvent-Mediated Synthesis of Hierarchical MOFs and Derived Urchin-Like Pd@SC/HfO2with High Catalytic Activity and Stability,"© Carbon materials with hierarchical morphologies, pores, and compositions have attracted extraordinary attention due to their unique structural advantages and widespread applications. However, their controllable synthesis remains a grand challenge. Herein, a solvent-mediated strategy was demonstrated for the preparation of an urchin-like superstructure via modulating the hydrothermal condition (acetic acid/water ratio) of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The direct pyrolysis of a hierarchical NUS-6 precursor produced a well-defined carbon-based composite consisting of sulfur-doped carbon (SC) and HfO2 with an urchin-like morphology and micro-/mesoporosity, while the doped S sites and oxygen vacancies of HfO2 can help to anchor and activate Pd nanoparticles (NPs) through the strong host-guest interaction, which was further confirmed by the calculated results of the binding energy and differential charge density through density functional theory (DFT). The synthesized Pd@SC/HfO2 composite exhibited extremely high catalytic activity and stability toward the water-phase hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin (conversion >99%, selectivity >99%), as well as good universality for the hydrogenation of a series of unsaturated hydrocarbons in an aqueous system. Remarkably, the catalytic activity and structural stability of Pd@SC/HfO2 were largely maintained even after successive 10 cycles.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Bridging Li7La3Zr2O12Nanofibers with Poly(ethylene oxide) by Coordination Bonds to Enhance the Cycling Stability of All-Solid-State Lithium Metal Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.A solid-state composite polymer electrolyte comprising Li7La3Zr2O12 nanofibers (LLZO NFs) as fillers has the advantages of flexibility, ease of processing, and being low cost, thus being considered to be a promising electrolyte material for use in the next generation of highly safe lithium metal batteries. However, poor compatibility of organic parts and inorganic materials leads to quick capacity decay after long-term charge/discharging running because of inorganic/organic interface deterioration and thus, the related ineffective lithium-ion (Li+) conduction. Herein, a ""Boston ivy-style""method is proposed to prepare a solid ceramic/polymer hybrid electrolyte that exhibits a dense interface structure. After grafting on Dynasylan IMEO (DI), the modified LLZO NFs are used as ligands to bond with coordinatively unsaturated metal centers of Ca2+. Furthermore, these Ca2+ bridge the modified LLZO NFs with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) via the ether oxygen atoms they possess. The bridges built between the two phases, PEO and LLZO NFs, are effective to interface strengthening and guarantee rapid Li+ conduction even after 900 cycles. The PEO/LLZO NFs-DI-Ca2+/LiTFSI electrolyte shows a high Li+ transference number of 0.72 (60 °C). The Li||LiFePO4 cell delivers excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 70.8% after 900 cycles, 0.5 C) and rate performance. The bridge strategy is proved to be effective and probably a promotion to the application of ceramic polymer-based solid-state electrolytes.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
TiO2@Chlorella-Based Biomass Carbon Modified Separator for High-Rate Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© The lithium-sulfur battery (Li-S battery) has attracted extensive attention because of its high energy density, but a series of disadvantages caused by sulfur insulation and the shuttle effect hinder the large-scale application of the Li-S battery. The conductive skeleton with strong adsorption on lithium polysulfide can effectively build the electron transmission path and inhibit the shuttle effect. In this study, a new type of chlorella-based biomass carbon skeleton carrying TiO2 metal sites (TiO2@CBBC) is designed and synthesized, and it was used as a functional separator modification material for the lithium sulfur battery. The biomass carbon skeleton has a unique three-dimensional skeleton and a unique specific surface, which can carry uniform titanium active sites and rich oxygen negative ions, so as to build a functional network of electron conduction, adsorbing polysulfide intermediates and promoting the dynamics of the sulfur conversion reaction. The Li-S battery equipped with a functional TiO2@CBBC separator shows excellent rate performance and cycle performance. The initial capacity of the lithium sulfur battery is up to 1011 mAh g-1 at 2C and can maintain 92% of the specific capacity after 100 cycles. At a stricter rate of 3C, the battery can still operate stably, and the coulomb efficiency remains above 95% throughout the entire process.

Emerging properties of carbon based 2D material beyond graphene,"© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.Graphene turns out to be the pioneering material for setting up boulevard to a new zoo of recently proposed carbon based novel two dimensional (2D) analogues. It is evident that their electronic, optical and other related properties are utterly different from that of graphene because of the distinct intriguing morphology. For instance, the revolutionary emergence of Dirac cones in graphene is particularly hard to find in most of the other 2D materials. As a consequence the crystal symmetries indeed act as a major role for predicting electronic band structure. Since tight binding calculations have become an indispensable tool in electronic band structure calculation, we indicate the implication of such method in graphene's allotropes beyond hexagonal symmetry. It is to be noted that some of these graphene allotropes successfully overcome the inherent drawback of the zero band gap nature of graphene. As a result, these 2D nanomaterials exhibit great potential in a broad spectrum of applications, viz nanoelectronics, nanooptics, gas sensors, gas storages, catalysis, and other specific applications. The miniaturization of high performance graphene allotrope based gas sensors to microscopic or even nanosized range has also been critically discussed. In addition, various optical properties like the dielectric functions, optical conductivity, electron energy loss spectra reveal that these systems can be used in opto-electronic devices. Nonetheless, the honeycomb lattice of graphene is not superconducting. However, it is proposed that the tetragonal form of graphene can be intruded to form new hybrid 2D materials to achieve novel superconducting device at attainable conditions. These dynamic experimental prospects demand further functionalization of these systems to enhance the efficiency and the field of multifunctionality. This topical review aims to highlight the latest advances in carbon based 2D materials beyond graphene from the basic theoretical as well as future application perspectives.",Journal of Physics Condensed Matter

Towards autonomous high-throughput multiscale modelling of battery interfaces,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.To date, battery research largely follows an ""Edisonian""approach based on experimental trial-and-error in contrast to a systematic strategy of design-of-experiments. Battery interfaces are arguably the most important yet the least understood components of energy storage devices. To transform the way we perform battery research, theory and computations can be used simultaneously to understand and guide the design of meaningful and targeted experiments. However, it is well known that modelling of battery interfaces is computationally prohibitive in terms of both resources and time due to the large size of systems to provide realistic and descriptive models. Recently, automated and intelligent in silico tools have been developed to accelerate the description of materials, such as workflows designed to generate, handle and analyse hundreds of thousands of materials data and at different scales. Here, we assess the latest computational strategies, outline unresolved questions, and propose future directions that will guide and drive future developments of interfaces in energy storage devices. The future directions include the development of complementary experimental techniques, such as high-throughput automated materials synthesis, operando characterization, cell assembly and integrated platforms for device testing.",Energy and Environmental Science
The LiTFSI/COFs Fiber as Separator Coating with Bifunction of Inhibition of Lithium Dendrite and Shuttle Effect for Li‐SeS2 Battery,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The safety problem caused by lithium dendrite of lithium metal anode and the rapid capacity decay problem caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfide and polyselenide during the charge and discharge of selenium disulfide cathode limit the application of lithium selenium disulfide batteries significantly. Here, a fibrous ATFG‐COF, containing rich carbonyl and amino functional groups, was applied as the separator coating layer. Density Functional Theory (DFT) theoretical calculations and experimental results showed that the abundant carbonyl group in ATFG‐COF had a positive effect on lithium ions, and the amino group formed hydrogen bonds with bis ((trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl) azanide anionics (TFSI−), which fixed TFSI− in the channel, so as to improve the transfer number of lithium ions and narrow the channels. Therefore, ATFG‐COF fiber coating can not only form a rapid and uniform lithium‐ion flow on the lithium anode to inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites, but also effectively screen polysulfide and polyselenide ions to suppress the shuttle effect. The Li‐SeS2 cell with ATFG‐COF/polypropylene (ATFG‐COF/PP) separator exhibited good cycle stability at 0.5 C and maintained a specific capacity of 509 mAh/g after 200 cycles. Our work provides insights into the design of dual‐function separators with high‐performance batteries.",Coatings
Two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3C2T: X ) MXenes to inhibit the shuttle effect in sodium sulfur batteries,"© the Owner Societies.Room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries (RT-NSBs) are among the promising candidates for large-scale energy storage applications because of the natural abundance of the electrode materials and impressive energy density. However, one of the main technical challenges of RT-NSBs is the shuttle effect by which active redox intermediates (i.e., sodium polysulfides Na2Sn, n = 1-8) are dissolved in electrolytes, which hamper the battery reversibility. The interfacial interplays between Na2Sn and the electrodes (or electrolytes) at the atomic level thus play an intrinsic role in elucidating the shuttle effect. This work reports the ab initio calculations to unravel the suppression of the shuttle effect using titanium carbide MXenes (Ti3C2Tx, Tx = F, O) as the cathode additives. The findings reveal that the shuttle phenomenon is efficiently resolved because the immense chemical bonding of Na2Sn-Ti3C2Tx interfaces competitively surpasses the binding magnitudes of Na2Sn-electrolyte interaction. The analysis of the electronic density of states and charge density further manifests that there is charge donation from the Na-3s orbital of Na2Sn to the unfilled F(O)-2p orbitals of metallic Ti3C2Tx. The metallicity of the Ti3C2Tx remains preserved during the entire course of the redox process, ensuring the rapid electrochemical kinetics. Furthermore, the presence of Ti3C2Tx additives drastically reduces the dissociation barrier of the final redox product Na2S, yielding the efficient utilization of sulfur during the discharge process. This work has proposed the unexplored functionality of Ti3C2Tx as the anchoring materials for RT-NSBs.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics

In view of the advantages of high theoretical capacity and desirable negative operating window, bismuth (Bi) has been deemed as a hopeful anode material for AARBs. Unfortunately, intensive reported works of Bi anode are still confronted with limited capacity and poor cycling stability. Herein, the designed electrodes of different size Bi nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon nanofibers with a contrasting nitrogen doping content are obtained by electrospinning and thermal treatment processes. The effect of the N dopant in carbon shell is demonstrated on the Bi core, which is in favor of enhancing the capacity of Bi anodes. More importantly, the core structure with highly dispersed ultrasmall Bi nanoparticles (<20 nm) in carbon matrix plays a crucial role in long-term durability.

Polysulfide regulation vs anode modification: Perspectives on commercializing lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Author(s).Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered the promising energy-storage devices to replace the aging lithium-ion batteries. Indeed, they have gained much attention in both academia and industry due to their high theoretical energy density. Although significant progress has been achieved in the field of academia, the same thing cannot be stated for the commercial production of Li-S batteries. This is evidenced by the fact that only a few studies have demonstrated a pouch-cell approach. Thus, it is important to realize the significant gap between academic research and the real-world production of lithium-sulfur cells. In this perspective, we discuss the issues and challenges behind the large-scale production of Li-S batteries; moreover, we highlight the recent advances in the development of lithium-sulfur pouch cells that are achieved either by polysulfide regulation or by anode modification. We hope that this review will attract more attention to the development of lithium-sulfur pouch cells to overcome the practical hurdles of large-scale production.",APL Materials
Enhanced sulfur redox kinetics by hollow structured NiCo2O4 entangled with acidified MWCNTs for lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Although lithium–sulfur battery is considered to be a competitive system for efficient energy storage, the shuttle effect of polysulfides and sluggish electrode reaction kinetics still hinder its practical application. Herein, we synthesized acidified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (AMWCNT)/NiCo2O4@S as an efficient cathode material for lithium–sulfur batteries. The AMWCNT skeleton can be used as an electron conductivity enhancer and physico-chemical adsorption sites for polysulfides, and the hollow structured NiCo2O4 spheres can not only accommodate the volume change during cycling, but also accelerate the redox kinetics and suppress the shuttle effect. Thus, the AMWCNT/NiCo2O4@S cathode delivers an initial capacity of 958.8 mAh·g−1 at 0.5 C, and the capacity remains 700.3 mAh·g−1 with a low capacity decay rate of 0.090% per cycle after 300 cycles. The unique structure design provides a potential host material for the high-capacity and -stability lithium–sulfur batteries.

Applications of liquid metals in nanotechnology,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Post-transition liquid metals (LMs) offer new opportunities for accessing exciting dynamics for nanomaterials. As entities with free electrons and ions as well as fluidity, LM-based nanomaterials are fundamentally different from their solid counterparts. The low melting points of most post-transition metals (less than 330 °C) allow for the formation of nanodroplets from bulk metal melts under mild mechanical and chemical conditions. At the nanoscale, these liquid state nanodroplets simultaneously offer high electrical and thermal conductivities, tunable reactivities and useful physicochemical properties. They also offer specific alloying and dealloying conditions for the formation of multi-elemental liquid based nanoalloys or the synthesis of engineered solid nanomaterials. To date, while only a few nanosized LM materials have been investigated, extraordinary properties have been observed for such systems. Multi-elemental nanoalloys have shown controllable homogeneous or heterogeneous core and surface compositions with interfacial ordering at the nanoscale. The interactions and synergies of nanosized LMs with polymeric, inorganic and bio-materials have also resulted in new compounds. This review highlights recent progress and future directions for the synthesis and applications of post-transition LMs and their alloys. The review presents the unique properties of these LM nanodroplets for developing functional materials for electronics, sensors, catalysts, energy systems, and nanomedicine and biomedical applications, as well as other functional systems engineered at the nanoscale.",Nanoscale Horizons
Designing a Functional CNT+PB@MXene-Coated Separator for High-Capacity and Long-Life Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Separators, as indispensable parts of LSBs (lithium–sulfur batteries), play a cucial role in inhibiting dendrite growth and suppressing the shuttle of lithium polysulfide (LiPSs). Herein, we prepared a functional carbon nanotube (CNT) and Fe-based Prussian blue (PB)@MXene/polypropylene (PP) composite separator using a facile vacuum filtration approach. The CNTs and MXene nanosheets are excellent electronic conductors that can enhance the composite separator electrical conductiv-ity, while Fe-based Prussian blue with a rich pore structure can effectively suppress the migration by providing physical space to anchor soluble LiPSs and retain it as cathode active material. Ad-ditionally, MXene nanosheets can be well attached to Fe-based Prussian blue by an electrostatic interaction and contribute to the physical barriers that inhibit the shuttle of long-chain soluble Li2 Sn (4 ≤ n ≤ 8).

Recent Developments in Carbon-Based Nanocomposites for Fuel Cell Applications: A Review,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Carbon-based nanocomposites have developed as the most promising and emerging materials in nanoscience and technology during the last several years. They are microscopic materials that range in size from 1 to 100 nanometers. They may be distinguished from bulk materials by their size, shape, increased surface-to-volume ratio, and unique physical and chemical characteristics. Carbon nanocomposite matrixes are often created by combining more than two distinct solid phase types. The nanocomposites that were constructed exhibit unique properties, such as significantly enhanced toughness, mechanical strength, and thermal/electrochemical conductivity. As a result of these advantages, nanocomposites have been used in a variety of applications, including catalysts, electrochemical sensors, biosensors, and energy storage devices, among others. This study focuses on the usage of several forms of carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon aerogels, carbon nanofibers, graphene, carbon nanotubes, and fullerenes, in the development of hydrogen fuel cells. These fuel cells have been successfully employed in numerous commercial sectors in recent years, notably in the car industry, due to their cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, and long-cyclic durability. Further; we discuss the principles, reaction mechanisms, and cyclic stability of the fuel cells and also new strategies and future challenges related to the development of viable fuel cells.",Molecules
Controlling the Structural Properties and Optical Bandgap of PbO–Al2O3 Nanocomposites for Enhanced Photodegradation of Methylene Blue,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In the present work, PbO-x wt% Al2O3 nanocomposites (where x = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 100 wt%) were prepared by a microwave irradiation method. Their structural parameters, morphology, and chemical bonds, were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It was noticed that the produced phases have an orthorhombic crystal structure and the smaller average crystallite sizes were formed when the ratio of Al2O3 is 40 wt%. The FTIR analysis reveals the formation of various bonds between Al or Pb and O. The TEM analysis reveals that the PbO-x%Al2O3 composites (x = 20, 40, and 60), composed of dense particles, and their size are smaller compared to the pure Al2O3 sample. The optical bandgap obeys the direct allowed transition and decreases from 4.83 eV to 4.35 eV as the PbO ratio in the composites increases from 0 to 100%. The intensity of the photoluminescence emission, at the same wavelength, increases as the PbO ratio increases from 0% to 60% implying that increasing the PbO content increases the capacity of free carriers within the trap centers. The prepared composites are used as a catalyst to remove the methylene blue (MB) from the wasted water under UV-visible or visible light irradiations. The photocatalytic degradation of MB was investigated by applying various kinetic models. It was found that the PbO-30% Al2O3, and PbO-40% Al2O3 composites are the best ones amongst other compositions. Furthermore, the pseudo-second-order model is the best model for describing the deterioration mechanism among the models studied. The formed composites could be suitable for the degradation of organic dyes for water purification as well as applications that required a higher optical bandgap.",Catalysts
Single-atom catalysts for lithium sulfur batteries via atomic layer deposition process,"© 2022 The Author(s)Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) has emerged as one of the foremost intriguing energy storage systems in the last decade, due to its higher energy density (ED), less expensive, and more environmentally friendly. However, the interface chemistries of electrode–electrolyte such as the shuttling effect of polysulfide and inadequate dynamic sulfur use have not yet been completely understood and managed when in operations, thus the employment of single-atom catalysts (SACs) provides the possibility to address these problems through the proper identification of structure–activity connexions and the chemical reaction processes at the atomic level. In this mini review, the usage of incredibly active SACs is examined with applications in long-lifecycle, higher-energy LSBs, as well as the possibility of SAC preparation using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to boost efficiency. Conclusively, the significant problems and future prospects for enhanced SACs via ALD in LSBs development are also discussed.",Electrochemistry Communications
Reductive Modification of Carbon Nitride Structure by Metals—The Influence on Structure and Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Pt, Ru, and Ir were introduced onto the surface of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) using the wet impregnation method. A reduction of these photocatalysts with hydrogen causes several changes, such as a significant increase in the specific surface area, a C/N atomic ratio, a number of defects in the crystalline structure of g-C3N4, and the contribution of nitrogen bound to the amino and imino groups. According to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, a transition layer is formed at the g-C3N4/metal nanoparticle interphase, which contains metal at a positive degree of oxidation bonded to nitrogen. These structural changes significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity in the production of hydrogen through the water-splitting reaction. The activity of the platinum photocatalyst was 24 times greater than that of pristine g-C3N4. Moreover, the enhanced activity was attributed to significantly better separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs on metal nanoparticles and structural distortions of g-C3N4.",Materials
Continuous Carbon Channels Enable Full Na-Ion Accessibility for Superior Room-Temperature Na–S Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHPorous carbon has been widely used as an efficient host to encapsulate highly active molecular sulfur (S) in Li–S and Na–S batteries. However, for these sub-nanosized pores, it is a challenge to provide fully accessible sodium ions with unobstructed channels during cycling, particularly for high sulfur content. It is well recognized that solid interphase with full coverage over the designed architectures plays critical roles in promoting rapid charge transfer and stable conversion reactions in batteries, whereas constructing a high-ionic-conductivity solid interphase in the pores is very difficult. Herein, unique continuous carbonaceous pores are tailored, which can serve as multifunctional channels to encapsulate highly active S and provide fully accessible pathways for sodium ions. Solid sodium sulfide interphase layers are also realized in the channels, showing high Na-ion conductivity toward stabilizing the redox kinetics of the S cathode during charge/discharge processes. This systematically designed carbon-hosted sulfur cathode delivers superior cycling performance (420 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 2000 cycles), high capacity retention of ≈90% over 500 cycles at current density of 0.5 A g−1, and outstanding rate capability (470 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1) for room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries.",Advanced Materials
Single-Atom Reversible Lithiophilic Sites toward Stable Lithium Anodes,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithiophilic sites with high binding energy to Li have shown the capability to guide uniform Li deposition, however, the irreversible reaction between Li and lithiophilic sites causes a loss of lithiophilicity. Herein, the concept of using reversible lithiophilic sites, such as single-atoms (SAs) doped graphene, as a host, is systematically inspected in the context of Li metal battery (LMB) performance. Here, it is proposed that the binding energy to Li atoms should be within a certain threshold range, i.e., strong enough to inhibit Li dendrite growth and weak enough to avoid host structure collapse. Six kinds of SAs are utilized; doped 3D graphene, nitrogen-doped 3D graphene, and pure 3D graphene, whose performance in LMBs are compared with each other. It is discovered that the SA-Mn doped 3D graphene (SAMn@NG) has the most reversible lithiophilic site, in which adsorption strength with Li is suitable to guide uniform deposition and keep the structure stable. During Li plating/stripping, the changes of the atomic structures in SAMn@NG, such as change of bond length and bond angle around Mn atoms are much smaller than those on SAZr@NG, although its binding energy is higher, enabling a much-improved battery performance in SAMn@NG. This work provides a new insight to design lithiophilic sites in LMBs.",Advanced Energy Materials

The practical commercial application of LSBs is mainly hindered by the severe “shuttle effect” of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the serious damage of lithium dendrites. Various carbon materials with different characteristics have played an important role in overcoming the above-mentioned problems. Carbon spheres (CSs) are extensively explored to enhance the performance of LSBs owing to their superior structures. The review presents the state-of-the-art advances of CSs for advanced high-energy LSBs, including their preparation strategies and applications in inhibiting the “shuttle effect” of the LiPSs and protecting lithium anodes. The unique restriction effect of CSs on LiPSs is explained from three working mechanisms: physical confinement, chemical interaction, and catalytic conversion. From the perspective of interfacial engineering and 3D structure designing, the protective effect of CSs on the lithium anode is also analyzed. Not only does this review article contain a summary of CSs in LSBs, but also future directions and prospects are discussed.

Revealing the Sulfur Redox Paths in a Li–S Battery by an In Situ Hyphenated Technique of Electrochemistry and Mass Spectrometry,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery is one of the most promising next generation energy storage systems due to its high theoretical specific energy. However, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides formed during cell operation is a crucial reason for the low cyclability suffered by current Li–S batteries. As a result, an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the sulfur cathode redox reactions is urgently required for further advancement of Li–S batteries. Herein, the direct observation of polysulfides in a Li-S battery is reported by an in situ hyphenated technique of electrochemistry and mass spectrometry. Several short-lived lithium polysulfide intermediates during sulfur redox have been identified. Furthermore, this method is applied to a mechanistic study of an electrocatalyst that has been observed to promote the polysulfides conversion in a Li–S cell. Through the abundance distributions of various polysulfides before and after adding the electrocatalyst, compelling experimental evidences of catalytic selectivity of cobalt phthalocyanine to those long-chain polysulfide intermediates are obtained.

This three-dimensional (3D) core shell architecture benefits mass diffusion and electron transfer at the heterojunction interface, and features more active sites and open structure available to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The WS2@Co3S4 NW/CC shows a superior HER and OER activity in an alkaline solution with only an overpotential of 82 mV for HER and 280 mV for OER to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The corresponding Tafel slope of HER and OER is 45 and 52 mV dec−1, respectively. Moreover, the WS2@Co3S4 NW/CC can maintain HER/OER activity without significant loss for 24 h at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. The superior bifunctional catalytic performance of WS2@Co3S4 NW/CC can substantially expedite its application in overall water splitting, which can deliver a current density of 100 mA cm−2 with only cell voltage of 1.56 V in a two-electrode electrolytic cell.

Auto-Oxygenated Porphyrin-Derived Redox Mediators for High-Performance Lithium Air-Breathing Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Because of their distinct energy potentials, Li air-breathing batteries have been highlighted as promising energy storage systems; however, the sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) disturb the reversible cell operation during cycling. Therefore, catalyst materials should be tailored to mitigate the low efficiencies of air-breathing batteries. A porphyrin-derived catalyst is optimized by introducing different metal-centered organometallic phthalocyanine (MPc) complexes and their potential application as redox mediators (RMs) for fabricating efficient Li–O2 cells is investigated. The feasibility of each MPc is determined as a potential RM by calculating its orbital levels. The electrochemical properties of the Li–O2 cells employing the diverse MPc-RMs are compared. The MPc-containing Li–O2 cells exhibit improved cell performance, reduced polarization, and stable cyclability with auto-oxygenated properties as revealed by directly injecting superoxide species into the MPc-containing electrolytes. The synergistic effects of blended MPcs—a mixture consisting of the two most effective MPcs—in both the OER and ORR regions in ambient air atmosphere are also elucidated. The reaction mechanism of the MPc-containing cells is proposed based on first-principles calculations and experimental results. The introduction of natural functional catalysts provides a basis for developing effective eco-friendly catalysts for application to sustainable air-breathing batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials
Solid polymer electrolytes based on polysiloxane with anion-trapping boron moieties for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdCross-linked solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) based on ion-conducting poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), flexible polysiloxane, and anion-trapping boron cross-linker (BPC) were prepared via thiol-ene click reaction for lithium metal batteries. Various thermal and electrochemical properties of SPEs were systematically investigated by varying the content of BPC. Thermally stable free-standing SPE systems could be obtained due to the cross-linked structure, while relatively high ionic conductivity of about 1.3 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 60 °C was obtained at the same time by the flexible polysiloxane moiety. The boron moiety in BPC could increase the lithium ion transference number compared to the corresponding boron-free SPE due to the anion-trapping capability of boron atom. The formation and growth of lithium dendrites were effectively suppressed by the anion-trapping capability and mechanically stable cross-linked structure of the SPE.",Polymer

Constructing Artificial SEI Layer on Lithiophilic MXene Surface for High-Performance Lithium Metal Anodes,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHMXene has been found as a good host for lithium (Li) metal anodes because of its high specific surface area, lithiophilicity, good stability with lithium, and the in situ formed LiF protective layer. However, the formation of Li dendrites and dead Li is inevitable during long-term cycle due to the lack of protection at the Li/electrolyte interface. Herein, a stable artificial solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is constructed on the MXene surface by using insulating g-C3N4 layer to regulate homogeneous Li plating/stripping. The 2D/2D MXene/g-C3N4 composite nanosheets can not only guarantee sufficient lithiophilic sites, but also protect the Li metal from continuous corrosion by electrolytes. Thus, the Ti3C2Tx/g-C3N4 electrode enables conformal Li deposition, enhanced average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.4%, and longer cycle lifespan over 400 cycles with an areal capacity of 1.0 mAh cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2. Full cells paired with LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode also achieve enhanced rate capacity and cycling stability with higher capacity retention of 85.5% after 320 cycles at 0.5C. The advantages of the 2D/2D lithiophilic layer/artificial SEI layer heterostructures provide important insights into the design strategies for high-performance and stable Li metal batteries.",Advanced Science

Here, we determined Nb2C MXene and MoS2 to form heterojunction due to their high lattice adaptation. The unique flower-petal-like Nb2C MXene was prepared by freeze-drying, the MoS2 growing on the surface of Nb2C MXene by hydrothermal method.

Towards High-performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: the Modification of Polypropylene Separator by 3D Porous Carbon Structure Embedded with Fe3C/Fe Nanoparticles,"© 2021, Jilin University, The Editorial Department of Chemical Research in Chinese Universities and Springer-Verlag GmbH.Lithium-sulfur(Li-S) batteries with high energy densities have received increasing attention. However, the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries is still far from the satisfactory of the practical application, which can be mainly attributed to the shuttling of polysulfides and the slow reaction kinetics of polysulfide conversion. To address this issue, a 3D porous carbon structure constructed by 2D N-doped graphene and 1D carbon nanotubes with embedded Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles(NG@Fe3C/Fe) was designed and prepared by a simple programmed calcination method for the modification of polypropylene(PP) separator. The Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles demonstrate an excellent catalytic conversion and strong chemisorption towards polysulfides, while the unique architecture of N-doped graphene promotes the Li+/electron transfer and the physical adsorption of polysulfides. The electrochemical performance of the Li-S batteries with the NG@Fe3C/Fe-modified separator is significantly improved. A large discharge capacity of 1481 mA·h·g−1 is achieved at 0.2 C, and a high capacity of 601 mA·h·g−1 is maintained after discharged/charged for 500 cycles at a current rate of 1 C.

Effects of Polymer Coating Mechanics at Solid-Electrolyte Interphase for Stabilizing Lithium Metal Anodes,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHLithium metal batteries are next-generation energy storage devices that rely on the stable electrodeposition of lithium metal during the charging process. The major challenge associated with this battery chemistry is related to the uneven deposition that leads to dendritic growth and poor coulombic efficiency (CE). A promising strategy for addressing this challenge is utilizing a polymer coating on the anodic surface. While several works in the past have evaluated polymer coatings, the requirements for polymer design are still unclear. In this work, the effect of polymer dynamics on lithium metal deposition is specifically investigated. Electrolyte (solvent) blocking perfluoropolyether polymer networks with evenly spaced H-bonding sites of various strengths are designed, resulting in significant differences in the molecular ordering, as analyzed by X-ray scattering measurements. The differences in the H-bonding strength directly impact the mechanical properties of these materials, thus providing a controlled set of samples with a range of polymer dynamics for electrodeposition studies. Finally, a systematic evaluation of the lithium metal electrodeposition quality with these polymers as anodic coating shows that polymers with flowability or faster polymer dynamics exhibit higher CE. These experimental findings provide rational design principles for soft polymer coatings on lithium metal anodes.",Advanced Energy Materials
A rational design of V2O3/VN heterostructures with high-efficient chemisorption and electrocatalytic activity for polysulfides in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Polysulfide shutting between cathode and anode and sluggish redox of solid-liquid-solid conversion largely impede the commercial applications of lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries.

Redox-active polymers: The magic key towards energy storage – a polymer design guideline progress in polymer science,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Renewable organic batteries represent a valuable option to store sustainably generated energy and can play a major role in phasing out current carbon-based energy production. Several approaches have emerged over the last 80 years that utilize organic redox materials as active components in batteries. In particular, polymers have gained considerable interest among numerous research groups due to their (1) fast redox chemistry, in comparison to conventional active materials, (2) straight-forward syntheses, and (3) tunable solubility, which represent favored properties for diverse electronic devices. Notably, the beginning of redox-active polymers is linked to the discovery of conductive polymers by Heeger, MacDiarmid and Shirakawa in 1977. Nevertheless, redox-active polymers were studied in 1944 making them a familiar class under the broader polymeric framework, which celebrate its 100th birthday in 2020, based on the pioneering publication by Staudinger in 1920. Since their beginning, redox-active polymers have evolved from an interesting phenomenon into a family of promising, tailor-made, battery materials that also made their way to commercialization. In this regard, this review focusses on the design of interesting polymeric, redox-active materials. Polymerization techniques are discussed regarding novel polymer architectures and utilitarian properties. The polymer architectures are subsequently analyzed within the application scenarios of solid-state batteries, pseudo-capacitors, and redox-flow batteries. Redox moieties are compared and an overview of diverse synthetic aspects as well as battery concepts for the optimal assembly of polymeric battery materials are given.",Progress in Polymer Science
Synergistic coupling between Fe7S8-MoS2 heterostructure and few layers MoS2-embeded N-/P-doping carbon nanocapsule enables superior Li-S battery performances,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Rechargeable Li-S batteries have attracted considerable interests because of their high theoretical energy density and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, the dissolution, shuttling and sluggish conversion of soluble lithium polysulfide intermediates seriously aggregates the cycle life and rate performances of batteries. In this work, a Fe7S8-MoS2 heterostructure decorated on few layers MoS2-embeded N-/P-doping carbon nanocapsule is for the first time developed as high efficient sulfur host for Li-S batteries. This structure offers a practical way to confine and catalyze the soluble lithium polysulfide. In particular, combining advantages with both coupling components, the Fe7S8-MoS2 heterostructure greatly enhances the adsorption abilities towards lithium polysulfide and accelerates their conversion kinetics. Besides, the few layers MoS2-embeded N-/P-doping carbon nanocapsule framework provides sufficient space and abundant adsorption sites to physically and chemically confine soluble lithium polysulfide, effectively suppressing their dissolution and shuttle effect. The synergistic coupling between the Fe7S8-MoS2 heterojunction catalyst and the delicately designed carbon architecture enables excellent rate capability and cycle performances for Li-S batteries.

Two Birds with One Stone: Interfacial Engineering of Multifunctional Janus Separator for Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHLi-dendrite growth and unsatisfactory sulfur cathode performance are two core problems that restrict the practical applications of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an all-in-one design concept for a Janus separator, enabled by the interfacial engineering strategy, is proposed to improve the performance of LSBs. At the interface of the anode/separator, the thin functionalized composite layer contains high-elastic-modulus and high-thermal-conductivity boron nitride nanosheets and oxygen-group-grafted cellulose nanofibers (BNNs@CNFs), by which the formation of “hot spots” can be effectively avoid, the Li-ion flux homogenized, and dendrite growth suppressed. Meanwhile, at the interface between the separator and the cathode, the homogenously exposed single-atom Ru on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO@Ru SAs) can “trap” polysulfides and reduce the activation energy to boost their conversion kinetics. Consequently, the LSBs show a high capacity of 460 mAh g–1 at 5C and ultrastable cycling performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle over 800 cycles. To further demonstrate the practical prospect of the Janus separator, a lithium–sulfur pouch cell using the Janus separator delivers a cell-level energy density of 310.2 Wh kg–1. This study provides a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the Li anode and the sulfur cathode in LSBs.",Advanced Materials
High-Performance Zinc-Air Batteries Based on Bifunctional Hierarchically Porous Nitrogen-Doped Carbon,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Active and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathode are required for high-performance rechargeable metal-air batteries. Herein, the synthesis of hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbon (HPNC) with bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis for Zn-air batteries is reported. The HPNC catalyst possesses a large surface area of 1459 m2 g−1 and exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward ORR and OER simultaneously with a low OER/ORR overpotential of 0.62 V, taking the difference between the potential at 10 mA cm−2 for OER and half-wave potential for ORR in 0.1 m KOH. Adopting HPNC as the air cathode, primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries are fabricated. The primary batteries demonstrate a high open-circuit potential of 1.616 V, a specific capacity of 782.7 mAh gZn−1 and a superb peak power density of 201 mW cm−2. The rechargeable batteries can be cycled stably for over 360 cycles or 120 h at the current density of 5 mA cm−2. As elucidated by density functional theory, N-doping is preferred on defective sites with pentagon configuration and on the edge in the form of pyridinic-N-type. The high content of these two motifs in HPNC leads to the superior ORR and OER activities, respectively.",Small
CoNiO2/Co4N Heterostructure Nanowires Assisted Polysulfide Reaction Kinetics for Improved Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHThe “shuttle effect” of soluble polysulfides and slow reaction kinetics hinder the practical application of Li–S batteries. Transition metal oxides are promising mediators to alleviate these problems, but the poor electrical conductivity limits their further development. Herein, the homogeneous CoNiO2/Co4N nanowires have been fabricated and employed as additive of graphene based sulfur cathode. Through optimizing the nitriding degree, the continuous heterostructure interface can be obtained, accompanied by effective adjustment of energy band structure. By combining the strong adsorptive and catalytic properties of CoNiO2 and electrical conductivity of Co4N, the in situ formed CoNiO2/Co4N heterostructure reveals a synergistic enhancement effect. Theoretical calculation and experimental design show that it can not only significantly inhibit “shuttle effect” through chemisorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides, but also improve the transport rate of ions and electrons. Thus, the graphene composite sulfur cathode supported by these CoNiO2/Co4N nanowires exhibits improved sulfur species reaction kinetics. The corresponding cell provides a high rate capacity of 688 mAh g−1 at 4 C with an ultralow decaying rate of ≈0.07% per cycle over 600 cycles. The design of heterostructure nanowires and graphene composite structure provides an advanced strategy for the rapid capture–diffusion–conversion process of polysulfides.",Advanced Science
In Situ Anchoring Co–N–C Nanoparticles on Co4N Nanosheets toward Ultrastable Flexible Self-Supported Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalyst Enables Recyclable Zn–Air Batteries Over 10 000 Cycles and Fast Charging,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHZn–air batteries (ZABs) are very promising for flexible energy storage, but their application is limited to the primary battery. Developing an efficient and non-noble metal cathode toward oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) is of great significance for the commercial application of rechargeable ZABs. Herein, a flexible self-supported integrated bifunctional cathode is presented in which the Co–N–C nanoparticles are in situ anchored on Co4N nanosheets via a facile and scalable strategy. Benefiting from integrated 3D architecture with adequate active sites, porous structure, high conductivity originating from the metal substrate, and the synergistic effects of Co–N–C and Co4N, the cathode exhibits excellent bifunctional activity (low overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for OER, high half-wave potential of 0.833 V for ORR), and ultralong durability for ORR/OER in the alkaline medium. Impressively, this cathode enables the recyclable aqueous ZABs a record overall lifespan over 10 000 cycles at 20 mA cm−2, and a superior fast-charging feature at an ultrahigh charging current density of 100 mA cm−2. Furthermore, such a flexible integrated cathode can be directly used as a self-supported cathode for flexible solid-state ZABs, with excellent reversibility for 300 cycles, demonstrating its feasibility for practical application.",Small
Microstructure dependent chemo-mechanical behavior of amorphous Si anodes for Li-ion batteries upon delithiation,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Alloying-type anodes exhibit the solid-state amorphization during charging/discharging cycles. The mechanical and electrochemical properties of amorphous reaction phases have been widely explored recently. However, there is still lack of understanding of the underlying mircostructure-property relation in the delithiation behavior of alloying anodes. Here we perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the microstructure effect on the chemo-mechanical properties of amorphous Si (a-Si) anodes upon delithiation. It is indicated that stress-free delithiation without sufficient structural relaxation leads to the gradual accumulation of structural disorder (the increase of excess energy) in amorphous Li-Si systems (a-LixSi). The creation of structural disorder during delithiation not only facilitates the plastic deformation of a-LixSi at lower stress, but also thermodynamically destabilizes a-LixSi associated with the drop of open-cell potentials. While upon constrained delithiation, the initial value of excess energy and reaction stress both contribute to the increase of structural disorder during delithiation process. Based on the stress-dependent chemical-potential model, the tensile stress increases open-cell potentials, and reduces the Li chemical potential which weakens the driving force for delithiation. As a result, the structural disorder and tensile reaction stress may cause the undesirable capacity fading of a-Si anodes, and is detrimental to the battery performance.",Journal of Power Sources
ZIF-derived hierarchical pore carbons as high-performance catalyst for methane decomposition,"© 2021 Energy InstituteCatalytic methane decomposition (CMD) is a promising route for H2 production. In this paper, MOF-derived hierarchical carbon catalysts were prepared by the carbonization of ZIF-8 with additional carbon source and used for CMD. The effects of carbonization temperature, reaction temperature, and the kinds of additional carbon sources on the structure of derived carbon materials and their catalytic performances were studied. The results showed that the morphology and textural properties can be improved by varying the carbonization temperature and additional carbon source. The specific surface area of the ZIF-derived carbon can be significantly increased, and the hierarchical pore structure with improved pore size distribution can be obtained, which leads to good performances for CMD. Catalytic performance can be obviously enhanced by increasing the reaction temperature. The C950-FA prepared by carbonization of ZIF-8 with furfuryl alcohol as additional carbon source exhibits the highest initial conversion of methane (64%) and good stability at 890 °C. About 11% methane conversion was kept after 2750 min. This study provides a new route for the preparation of carbon material catalysts to achieve high-efficient conversion of methane.",Journal of the Energy Institute
π-Conjugation Induced Anchoring of Ferrocene on Graphdiyne Enable Shuttle-Free Redox Mediation in Lithium-Oxygen Batteries,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHSoluble redox mediators (RMs), an alternative to conventional solid catalysts, have been considered an effective countermeasure to ameliorate sluggish kinetics in the cathode of a lithium–oxygen battery recently. Nevertheless, the high mobility of RMs leads to serious redox shuttling, which induces an undesired lithium-metal degeneration and RM decomposition during trade-off catalysis against the sustainable operation of batteries. Here, a novel carbon family of graphdiyne matrix is first proposed to decouple the charge-carrying redox property of ferrocene and the shuttle effects. It is demonstrated that a ferrocene-anchored graphdiyne framework can function as stationary RM, not only preserving the redox-mediating capability of ferrocene, but also promoting the local orientated three-dimensional (3D) growth of Li2O2. As a result, the RM-assisted catalysis in lithium–oxygen battery remains of remarkable efficiency and stability without the depletion of oxidized RMs or lithium degradation, resulting in a significantly enhanced electrochemical performance.",Advanced Science
Recent advances and challenges of metal–organic framework/graphene-based composites,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a new kind of porous crystalline material synthesized by the assembly of metal ions and organic ligands, which have the advantages of a large specific surface area, high porosity, and tunable pore structures and morphological features. Owing to their ease of design as well as uniform and fine-tunable pore structures, MOFs are widely employed in several applications, such as in catalysts, supercapacitors, adsorbents, sensors, environmental protection, and drug delivery. However, the poor stability and electrical conductivity of traditional MOFs limit their applications. Using graphene-based materials with rich functional groups as templates for the growth of MOF particles can not only alleviate the poor conductivity and structural instability of MOFs, but also avoid the aggregation and restacking phenomenon between graphene sheets, thereby greatly expanding the application scope of MOFs. Due to the tunable structure and composition of derivatives, MOF-derived/graphene materials can also be used as multifunctional precursors, especially in the field of electrochemistry. The latest synthesis methods of MOF/graphene composites and their derivatives, as well as their diverse applications, are reviewed in this paper. In addition, the future development opportunities and challenges corresponding to MOF/graphene composites are discussed.",Composites Part B: Engineering
Superior electrochemical performance of Sb–Bi alloy for sodium storage: Understanding from alloying element effects and new cause of capacity attenuation,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Sb–Bi alloy has attracted increased attention as anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its particular crystal structure relevance and synergy effect. However, the cycle performance and actual capacity of Sb–Bi alloy are still not satisfactory, and the mysteries about partial role of elemental compositions and causes of capacity attenuation remain unsolved either. Herein, 3D Sb–Bi alloy/N-doped porous carbons (N–PCs) with different Sb/Bi mole ratios have been synthesized successfully. As for SIB anodes, 3D Bi3Sb1/N-PC presents a superior rate capability up to 30 A g−1 (specific capacity: 318.3 mAh g−1) and cyclic stability (capacity decays: 0.0054% per cycle at 10 A g−1 after 6000 cycles). Furthermore, the dissolution behavior of metallic Sb can be found after long-term cycles with DME-based electrolyte, and the dissolved Sb can shuttle to the other side of the separators, leading to “dead antimony” with low specific capacity and unsatisfactory cycle performance. Notably, Bi crystal shows strong fixing effect on Sb atoms with low loss of “active antimony”. Our work presents a great potential of alloy-type anode materials for practical applications of high-energy SIBs, and also provide a new direction to analyze element roles and attenuation causes of Sb–Bi alloys for sodium storage.",Journal of Power Sources
Integrated Porous Cu Host Induced High-Stable Bidirectional Li Plating/Stripping Behavior for Practical Li Metal Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe double-sided electrodes with active materials are widely used for commercial lithium (Li) ion batteries with a higher energy density. Accordingly, developing an anode current collector that can accommodate the stable and homogeneous Li plating/stripping on both sides will be highly desired for practical Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, an integrated bidirectional porous Cu (IBP-Cu) film with a through-pore structure is fabricated as Li metal hosts using the powder sintering method. The resultant IBP-Cu current collector with tunable pore volume and size exhibits high mechanical flexibility and stability. The bidirectional and through-pore structure enables the IBP-Cu host to achieve homogeneous Li deposition and effectively suppresses the dendritic Li growth. Impressively, the as-fabricated Li/IBP-Cu anode exhibits a remarkable capacity of up to 7.0 mAh cm−2 for deep plating/stripping, outstanding rate performance, and ultralong cycling ability with high Coulombic efficiency of ≈100% for 1000 cycles. More practicably, a designed pouch cell coupled with one Li/IBP-Cu anode and two LiFePO4 cathodes exhibits a highly elevated energy density (≈187.5%) compared with a pouch cell with one anode and one cathode. Such design of a bidirectional porous Cu current collector with stable Li plating/stripping behaviors suggests its promising practical applications for next-generation Li metal batteries.",Small
Manipulating the Conversion Kinetics of Polysulfides by Engineering Oxygen p-Band of Halloysite for Improved Li-S Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHPolar oxides are widely used as the cathodes to impede the shuttle effect in lithium-sulfur batteries, but suffer from the sluggish desorption and conversion of polysulfides due to too strong affinity of polysulfides on oxygen sites. Herein, employing halloysite as a model, an approach to overcome these shortcomings is proposed via engineering oxygen p-band center by loading titanium dioxide nanoparticles onto Si-O surface of halloysite. Using density functional theory calculations, it is predicted that electron transfer from titanium dioxide nanoparticles to interfacial O sites results in downshift of p-band center of O sites that promote desorption of polysulfides and the cleavage of Li-S and S-S, accelerating the conversion kinetics of polysulfides. The designed composite cathode material delivers outstanding electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries, outperforming the recently reported similar cathodes. The concept could provide valuable insight into the design of other catalysts for Li-S batteries and beyond.",Small
Ultrafine NbN nanoparticle decorated nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets with efficient polysulfide catalytic conversion for superior Li–S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries are considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems beyond commercial lithium-ion batteries, but the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries is still hindered by the severe polysulfides dissolution and sluggish redox reaction kinetics with low areal capacity. Herein, ultrafine NbN decorated nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets are reported via C3N4 sacrifice template using phenolic resol as carbon precursor. The ultrafine NbN nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbons guarantee efficient polysulfides trapping and fast redox reaction kinetics even with a high sulfur content of 75 wt%. In addition, porous carbon nanosheets and NbN nanoparticles provide more active sites for Li2S nucleation and serve as a second host for the reuse of sulfur. Hence, the lithium-sulfur cells with NbN@CNS-5 modified multifunctional separator deliver a high initial capacity of 1252 mAh g−1 @ 0.2 C, 683 mAh g−1 @ 4 C, and high capacity retention of 84.5% after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. Furthermore, a high initial capacity of 4.95 mAh cm−2 and 4.01 mAh cm−2 @0.2 C after 200 cycles are achieved at a sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm−2. These findings open up a new method for the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries with superior sulfur utilization and a long lifespan.",Journal of Power Sources
Boosting Nitrogen Reduction Reaction via Electronic Coupling of Atomically Dispersed Bismuth with Titanium Nitride Nanorods,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHElectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising alternative to the traditional Haber–Bosch process. However, the sluggish kinetics and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction result in poor NH3 yield and low Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, single bismuth atoms incorporated hollow titanium nitride nanorods encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon layer (NC) supported on carbon cloth (NC/Bi SAs/TiN/CC) is constructed for electrocatalytic NRR. Impressively, as an integrated electrode, it exhibits a superior ammonia yield rate of 76.15 µg mgcat−1 h−1 (9859 µg μmolBi−1 h−1) at −0.8 V versus RHE and a high FE of 24.60% at −0.5 V versus RHE in 0.1 m Na2SO4 solution, which can retain stable performance in 10 h continuous operation, surpassing the overwhelming majority of reported Bi-based NRR catalysts. Coupling various characterizations with theory calculations, it is disclosed that the unique monolithic core-shell configuration with porous structure endows abundant accessible active sites, outstanding charge-transfer property, and good stability, while the cooperation effect of Bi SAs and TiN can simultaneously promote the hydrogenation of N2 into NH3* on the TiN surface and the desorption of NH3* to release NH3 on the Bi SA sites. These features result in the significant promotion of NRR performance.",Advanced Science
Coordinating light management and advance metal nitride interlayer enables MAPbI3 solar cells with >21.8% efficiency,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdDue to the continuous increase in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are widely considered as the most promising technology for third generation photovoltaics. Improving optical absorption while reducing electrical losses is still a challenge towards attaining PCE values closer to the Shockley-Queisser limit. However, frequently used strategies to improve light absorption (e.g. via texturing the front surface) often cause electrical recombination losses. Here, we successfully relaxed the competing mechanisms between electrical and optical properties by integrating a modulated textured substrate and an amorphous metal nitride interface modification layer to combine enhanced light scattering and reducing interfacial recombination losses in PSCs. This comprehensive electro-optical management presents several advantages, including increased light absorption, promoting bandgap alignment and passivating the underlying perovskite defects. Consequently, the resulting MAPbI3 solar cells exhibit a high open-circuit voltage of 1.17 V and the concomitant high PCE of 21.84%. In addition, we also use numerical simulations to propose approaches towards achieving high efficiency (PCE>30%) PSCs. Besides expanding the pool of available strategies for improving the efficiency of PSCs, from photon management to interface engineering, our work also offers a systematic guidance for the design and fabrication of high performance photovoltaic devices.",Nano Energy

Oxide Nanoclusters on Ti3C2 MXenes to Deactivate Defects for Enhanced Lithium Ion Storage Performance,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The commercialization of MXenes as anodes for lithium-ion batteries is largely impeded by low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unfavorable cycling stability, which are closely associated with defects such as Ti vacancies (VTi) in Ti3C2 MXenes. Herein, an effective strategy is developed to deactivate VTi defects by in situ growing Al2O3 nanoclusters on MXenes to alleviate the irreversible electrolyte decomposition and Li dendrites formation trend induced by defects, improving ICE and cycling stability. Furthermore, it is revealed that excessively lithiophilic VTi defects would impede Li ions diffusion due to their strong adsorption, leading to a locally nonuniform Li flux to these “hot spots,” setting scene for the formation of Li dendrites. The Al2O3 nanoclusters anchored on VTi sites can not only improve Li diffusion kinetics but also promote the homogeneous solid electrolyte interphase formation with small charge transfer resistance, achieving uniform Li deposition in a smaller overpotential without formation of Li dendrites. As expected, Ti3C2@Al2O3-11 electrode delivers a high ICE of 76.6% and an outstanding specific capacity of 285.5 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles, which is much higher than that of pristine Ti3C2 sample.

Effect of one-step hydrothermal reaction conditions on the crystal growth of nano-/micro-MoS2,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The hydrothermal reaction has been applied popularly to prepare special nano-/micro-morphology materials with the typical characterized of low cost and high yield. Nevertheless, it is difficult to control the morphology and scale of crystal growth purely by the necessary reactants and simply changing the reaction conditions. This paper investigated the one-step hydrothermal method to prepare MoS2 by adjusting the crucial factors of temperature as well as surfactant content. In the deficiency of surfactant, MoS2 powders grew in two ways: deposition as microsphere and longitudinally into nanorods. As the temperature rising, the layer-by-layer order of product should be better, but the transverse growth was intense and the layer thickness was further thickening. Inversely, uniform and individual spherical micro-flowers of MoS2 can be modulated by the surfactant, which expanded available surface active sites and relieved large internal stress during cycling. Moreover, to further improve its performance, carbon recombination is essential in a variety of strategies.",Ionics
ZIF-67-derived cobalt-based sulfate CoSO4/carbon nanotube nanocomposites as host material for high-performance lithium–sulfur battery cathode,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are considered the most likely replacement for conventional lithium–ion batteries in next-generation high-energy output solutions based on their high specific capacity (1675 mAh g−1) and high-energy density (2600 Wh kg−1). But, there are some problems that need to be solved urgently. In this work, an environmentally friendly, green, and low-cost ZIF-67-derived cobalt-based sulfate material (CoSO4) combined with carbon nanotubes was proposed as a sulfur host material. Experiments show that the addition of CoSO4 can significantly enhance the transformation of polysulfide and suppress the shuttle effect. The best performance is the CNT-CoSO4-2/S, which has an initial capacity of 1356.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C current density. Furthermore, long-term cycle test was carried out at a current density of 0.2 C; the coulombic efficiency was above 98.63% after 200 cycles.

Concurrent Polyvalent Interaction and Electrocatalysis to Improve Lithium-Sulfur Battery Performance,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHBatteries with improved efficiency are desired. Li−S batteries are attractive due to their high specific capacity and energy density. However, sluggish sulfur redox reaction and polysulfide dissolution are significant challenges in Li−S batteries. In this work, we report graphene with doped layer to electrocatalyze the sluggish sulfur redox reaction. The doped layer comprises heteroatoms such as either N or N and S. The doped layer also comprises cations of Ni. We have chosen a “doped layer on graphene” over “doped graphene” to avoid defects in the basal plane of graphene. We found the doped layer comprising graphene (DLC−G) to electrocatalyze the polysulfide redox reaction. However, the interaction between the doped layer and polysulfide is still weak, hence the dissolution is not suppressed. To circumvent the polysulfide dissolution, graphene with cationic layer was prepared. We found that cations in the layer electrostatically attract the polysulfides due to the polyvalent interaction. Thus, the dissolution is suppressed. While using this material in the Li−S batteries, the specific capacity, energy density and power density were found to be 1345 mAh g−1, 782 Wh kg−1 and 4437 W kg−1, respectively.",Batteries and Supercaps

Nevertheless, the shuttle effect of dissoluble sulfurous intermediates is the primary obstacle which hinders their practical application. Herein, a porous carbon fiber membrane embedded with cobalt nanoparticles (Co–PCNF) was prepared by electrostatic spinning, then the active material was firmly fixed between the two layers of Co–PCNF to form a unique sandwich structure. With this strategy, an aluminum foil current collector can be replaced by the Co–PCNF sandwich structure, which is helpful to improve the energy density of Li–S battery as well as coordinate the volume change of sulfur in the process of charge and discharge, what's more, the shuttle effect is significantly inhibited. Results show that the as-assembled battery delivers an initial discharge specific capacities of 1013.3 mAh g−1 and 933.4 mAh g−1 at 0.5C and 1C, together with the decay rate of only 0.04% and 0.08% per cycle over 500 cycles, respectively. Moreover, the larger sulfur load (2.2 mg cm−2) still has the discharge specific capacity of 1009.8 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles at 0.2C. This Co–PCNF sandwich electrode may provide a new idea for the structural design for Li–S batteries.",Carbon

A new type of chemical crosslinked ionic gel polymer electrolyte (IGPE) with good self-healing ability and excellent electrochemical properties is designed based on polyoxyethylenebis(amine), and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxaldehyde in the presence of ionic liquid through a one-step reaction. The interaction between ionic liquid and polymer with the ether oxygen atom of EO chains improves the stability of IGPE and the crystallinity decreased significantly due to the incorporation of ionic liquid. The IGPEs show good self-healing, film flexibility, and high ionic conductivity even at −25 °C. They also possess high thermal stability, wide electrochemical stability window, and good interfacial compatibility. The Li/IGPE-50/LiFeO4 battery with IGPE-50 as an electrolyte is studied and the high discharge capacity of 154.8 mAh g−1 is obtained at 0.1 C with 99.6% of coulombic efficiency, and remains 132.8 mAh g−1 on the 50th cycle.

A low-cost, simple, and environmentally friendly method to produce graphene is of great importance and such a method is required to fully exploit its physical and chemical properties for various applications. The present review reports the recent progress and developments on efficient methods for graphene synthesis, focusing primarily on the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in inorganic salts or aqueous acids, assessing the method capabilities for mass production of doped electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EEG) for energy storage applications. A facile electrochemical exfoliation of graphite is typically carried out in a parallel two-electrode electrolytic cell system with aqueous inorganic salt-based electrolytes under ambient conditions. The nature of the EEG can be easily tuned by controlling the exfoliation conditions. Furthermore, the qualities of the graphene produced from the electrochemical exfoliation method using different electrolytes and setup parameters were reviewed comprehensively, regarding yield, chemical and physical properties (i.e., the morphology (layers and lateral size distribution), the nature and concentration of doped heterogeneous atoms, temperature stability, the degree of disorder, carbon/oxygen ratio, electrical conductivity (or sheet resistance), and the electrochemical performance in energy storage applications. Heteroatom doped EEG presents great promise for future design and large-scale production of affordable and high-performance composite electrodes for energy storage devices, e.g., hybrid supercapacitors, batteries, and full cells.",Journal of Energy Storage
Activating MoS2 Nanoflakes via Sulfur Defect Engineering Wrapped on CNTs for Stable and Efficient Li-O2 Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHDeveloping efficient cathode catalysts can largely promote the application of Li-O2 batteries (LOBs). In this work, the core-shell MoS2−x@CNTs composite is synthesized via a hydrothermal method with annealing and NaBH4 reduction post-processing, of which the defective MoS2 nanoflakes are homogeneously coated on the 3D carbon nanotube (CNT) webs. It is found that it delivers superior bifunctional catalytic activities toward both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions for LOBs. On the one hand, the charge re-distribution on MoS2 nanoflakes with sulfur vacancies can be effectively constructed by the surface engineering strategy, remarkably boosting the kinetics of Li-O2 catalysis. On the other hand, the conductive and high surface area CNT network can facilitate mass transfer and provide enough free space for composite cathodes, accommodating the volume changes caused by the reversible formation and decomposition of discharge products during cycling. More importantly, the unique core-shell architecture can not only enable fully covering of defective MoS2 nanoflakes on CNT surfaces to avoid the contact between CNTs and electrolyte, distinctly suppressing side reactions, but also realize the exposure of more active sites to fulfill their catalytic properties. This work provides an insightful investigation on advanced catalysts and holds great potential for catalyst structural engineering in LOBs.",Advanced Functional Materials
"New insight into the structural stability, ductility and melting point of Mo5SiB2 under high-pressure environment","© 2021 Elsevier LtdMo5SiB2 is an attractive high-temperature ceramic because of the excellent mechanical and thermodynamic properties. However, the role of high pressure on the structural stability and the related properties of Mo5SiB2 is entirely unclear. In this work, we apply the first-principles calculations to study the influence of pressure on the structural stability, mechanical properties and melting point of Mo5SiB2. Here, three possible Mo5SiB2 phases: D8l-Mo5SiB2, D8m-Mo5SiB2 and Cmcm-Mo5SiB2 are considered. The results show that all Mo5SiB2 are thermodynamic stability. In particular, it is found that the thermodynamic stability of Mo5SiB2 follows the order of D8l-Mo5SiB2>cmcm-Mo5SiB2> D8m-Mo5SiB2. The calculated bulk modulus and Young's modulus of D81-Mo5SiB2 under zero pressure are bigger than the cmcm-Mo5SiB2 and D8m-Mo5SiB2. Importantly, the pressure significantly improves the ductility of all Mo5SiB2 because the pressure can adjust the localized hybridization between Mo, Si and B atoms. In addition, it is found that the calculated melting point of all Mo5SiB2 increases with increasing the pressure. The melting point of the Cmcm-Mo5SiB2 is higher than the D8l and D8m phases under high pressure.",Vacuum
Effect of pore structures on desolvation of carbon materials as the electrode materials of supercapacitors: A first-principles study,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.More and more attention has been paid to the role of the desolvation effect of ions in the electrolyte for supercapacitor in improving its capacitance. We have previously calculated that the complete desolvation size of Li+, Na+, and K+ in the basal plane pore (BPP) is 4.7 Å, 4.4 Å, and 4.4 Å, but the desolvation of the edge plane pore (EPP) is not considered. So in this work, the complete desolvation behaviour of Li+, Na+, and K+ at the EPP in the pore structure of porous carbon materials in the aqueous solution is studied by first-principles calculations. The calculation results show that the solvated Li+ can be completely desolvated when the pore size of EPP is less than 3.61 Å, while the solvated Na+ and K+ will not be desolvated under any pore size of EPP. Combining the work of this paper with our previous work, solvated Li+ has desolvation behaviour in both EPP and basal plane pore (BPP). Four models of pores are constructed by the combination of EPP and BPP to discuss the storage of desolvated Li+ in porous carbon materials. The calculation results show that the necking flask like EPP-BPP pore with ∼ 3.61 Å outer pore and ∼ 7.4 Å inner pore can accommodate more Li+ improving the capacitance of the supercapacitors. The desolvation mechanism of EPP and BPP on the solvated ions has important theoretical guiding significance for designing the pore structure of porous carbon materials.",Computational Materials Science
Dense Crystalline–Amorphous Interfacial Sites for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe crystalline-amorphous (c–a) heterostructure is verified as a promising design for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts due to the concerted advantages of the crystalline and amorphous phase. However, most heterostructures via asynchronous heterophase synthesis suffer from the limited synergistic effect because of the sparse c–a interfaces. Here, a highly efficient and stable OER electrocatalyst with dense c–a interfacial sites is reported by hybridizing crystalline Ag and amorphous NiCoMo oxides (NCMO) on the nickel foam (NF) via synchronous dual-phase synthetic strategy. In 1 m KOH, the as-obtained Ag/NCMO/NF catalyst exhibits a low OER overpotential of 243 mV to attain 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 67 mV dec−1. Theoretical calculations indicate that the c–a interface can efficiently modulate the electronic structure of the interfacial sites and lower the OER overpotential. Besides, in situ Raman spectroscopy results demonstrate that the c–a interfacial sites can promote the irreversible phase transition to the metal oxy(hydroxide) active phase, and the dense c–a interfaces can stabilize the active phase during the whole OER process.",Advanced Functional Materials
NiCo2S4 nanoparticles grown on graphene as the sulfur host for high-performance lithium/sulfur batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries have drawn intensive research interest due to their high theoretical energy density. However, there remain several challenges that hinder their practical application, mainly coming from intermediate polysulfide dissolution and shuttling. Herein, we prepared NiCo2S4 nanoparticles grown on graphene as the sulfur host for high-performance Li–S batteries. Such nanosheet composite made of interconnected graphene can offer abundant space to carry the large amount of S, convenient pathways for both rapid Li+ and electrons transfer, and extra reversible capacity contribution. Particularly, each individual NiCo2S4 nanoparticle is polarized synergistically, thus preventing the amassment of soluble polysulfides benefiting from polar-polar interaction and improving sulfur utilization. As a result, the S@NiCo2S4/N-GO composite exhibits a stable capacity of 1199.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C after 100 cycles with capacity retention of 99.04%. Our work may offer a great potential in rational design of superior cathodes for the practical Li–S battery systems.",Ionics
Three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous trimetal sulfide as efficient electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are indispensable in rechargeable zinc-air batteries. Herein, three-dimensional ordered macroporous N-doped trimetal sulfides (3DOM N-Co0.8Fe0.1Ni0.1Sx) bifunctional catalyst has been developed. The 3DOM porous structure provides rich channels for mass transportation and exposure of catalytic active sites. Together with the synergistic effect of trimetallic sulfide and N-doped carbon layer, this 3DOM catalyst exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic activity, delivering an ORR half-wave potential of 0.80 V (vs RHE) and low OER overpotential of 370 mV at current density of 10 mA cm−2. The zinc-air battery with 3DOM N-Co0.8Fe0.1Ni0.1Sx achieves a stable cyclability with a lifetime of over 200 h at 10 mA cm−2. In-situ Raman analysis reveals that, during the OER process, surface reconstitution of the sulfide catalyst occurs, forming oxyhydroxides component. The latter is considered as the real OER catalytic phase. This study advances the design of efficient and durable nonprecious bifunctional catalysts for rechargeable zinc-air batteries.",Applied Surface Science
Origin of pure and C doped borophene stability and its activity for OER,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In borophene, vacancy is a major reason for stability. However, a detailed understanding relating to vacancy and electronic property remains unexplored. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) the effect of vacancy and doping on stability, electronic and catalytic properties of borophene is addressed in this work. It is shown how vacancy increases σ-electrons and decreases π-electrons of the neighboring boron atoms with the magnitude decreasing from 4 to 6-coordinated atoms, thereby contributing to their stability. The role of single and dual carbon doping on σ- and π-occupancy is explored. In addition, we have shown that dual carbon doping on β12-borophene analogue reduces the overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We observed that the charge deficient boron atom helps in the reduction of oxygen binding and can decrease the overpotential towards OER. Overall, this work would help in fundamental understanding towards borophene stability and aid in choosing the suitable dopant for catalytic applications considering the stability.",Applied Surface Science
Highly stable TiOF monolayer as anode material for the applications of Li/Na-ion batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In this work, we investigated 2D TiOF as anode for the applications of ion-battery with density functional theory. TiOF monolayer can be exfoliated from bulk structure with very small exfoliation energy of 0.74 J/m2. It is thermodynamically stable at 1000 K according to the ab-initio molecular dynamics simulation. High specific capacities for Li and Na are expected to be 970 mAh/g. The corresponding theoretical energy densities are 2160 and 1972 mWh/g, respectively, which are much higher than some reported 2D material anode analogues. Furthermore, the diffusion barrier of the adsorbed Li/Na ions are predicted to be 0.15/0.14 eV, indicating that TiOF has an ultrahigh rate capacity. During the Li/Na ions intercalation process, the metallic feature and structural integrity of TiOF remains preserved which gives rise to good battery operating cycle and well electronic conductivity. These results indicate that TiOF can be served as an appealing anode for rechargeable both Li/Na-ion batteries.",Applied Surface Science
Nitrogen-doped ordered multi-hollow layered carbon embedded with Mo2C as lithium polysulfide restrained cathode for Li-S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are constrained due to the poor electrical conductivity of sulfur, the shuttle effect, and the volume expansion during the cycle. In this study, N-doped ordered multi-hollow layered carbon embedded with Mo2C is successfully prepared (Mo2C@NC-NaCl) under the co-regulation of dicyandiamide and sodium chloride on the carbon material. In the carbon material, the multi-hollow layered carbon skeleton derived from biomass acts as an advanced sulfur host, which can accelerate electron transportation and buffer volume changes. The synergistic effect of Mo2C nanoparticles and pyridine N anchors lithium polysulfides and realizes fast sulfur electrochemistry. Benefiting from the above advantages, Mo2C@NC-NaCl with a sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm−2 delivers a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1226.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C. Even at a high rate of 1 C, the battery still achieves an initial capacity of 853.7 mAh g−1 and the average capacity decay rate per cycle is 0.065% over 500 cycles. It is expected this work provides a new perspective for large-scale production of cathode materials for Li-S batteries.",Applied Surface Science
Initiating VB-Group Laminated NbS2 Electromagnetic Wave Absorber toward Superior Absorption Bandwidth as Large as 6.48 GHz through Phase Engineering Modulation,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHVB-Group transition metal disulfides (TMDs) are considered excellent materials for electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption because of their good conductivity and abundant active sites located at their edges and substrates, as compared with VIB-Group TMDs. Herein, for the first time, EMW absorbers based on VB-Group NbS2 nanosheets by using a facile one-step solvothermal method are successfully prepared. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) can reach up to 43.85 dB with an effective absorption bandwidth of 6.48 GHz (11.52–18.00 GHz). The remarkable EMW absorption performance can also be reflected in the tunable frequency bands (C-, X-, and Ku-bands), which is achieved by adjusting the contents of materials. Furthermore, the influence of the content of 2H-phase and 1T-phase in NbS2 on the EMW absorption performance is systematically investigated. The hierarchical hollow-sphere structure of NbS2 promotes dielectric loss and the multiple reflection and absorption of EMW, and enhances the impedance matching and synergistic attenuation ability. This work demonstrates that the bottleneck of effective absorbing frequency band of single-component dielectric EMW absorbing materials could be broken through, and paves a novel path towards developing broadband absorbing materials in EMW absorption.",Advanced Functional Materials
Bifunctional Catalytic Effect of CoSe2 for Lithium–Sulfur Batteries: Single Doping versus Dual Doping,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHDesigning catalysts to accelerate the conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is regarded as a promising strategy to inhibit the shuttle effect, improving cathode performance of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, a bifunctional Ni/Zn dual-doped CoSe2 is designed to enhance the catalytic effect of CoSe2. Specifically, Ni functions better in catalyzing the conversion of LiPSs into Li2S with shorter Co-S bond and longer S-S bonds than Zn, while Zn demonstrates a better catalytic effect for Li2S decomposition with reduced Li2S decomposition barrier and elongated Li-S bonds than Ni. Those endows Ni/Zn dual-doped CoSe2 with bifunction in catalyzing conversion reaction of LiPSs and Li2S precipitation as well as the decomposition of Li2S, originating from the modified molecular structure of LiPSs and Li2S. As a result, the sulfur cathode with Ni0.1Zn0.1Co0.8Se2 achieves a rate capability of 681.74 mAh g–1 at 2C, and a cycling stability for 400 cycles with a decay rate of 0.065%. This work provides an effective way to improve catalytic effect of transition metal compounds for advanced LSBs by homogenous dual doping.",Advanced Functional Materials
Graphene-Supported Atomically Dispersed Metals as Bifunctional Catalysts for Next-Generation Batteries Based on Conversion Reactions,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHNext-generation batteries based on conversion reactions, including aqueous metal–air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal-O2 and -CO2 batteries, alkali metal-chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal-ion batteries have attracted great interest. However, their use is restricted by inefficient reversible conversion of active agents. Developing bifunctional catalysts to accelerate the conversion reaction kinetics in both discharge and charge processes is urgently needed. Graphene-, or graphene-like carbon-supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G-ADMCs) have been demonstrated to show excellent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions, making them promising candidates. Different from G-ADMCs for catalysis, which only require high activity in one direction, G-ADMCs for rechargeable batteries should provide high activity in both discharging and charging. This review provides guidance for the design and fabrication of bifunctional G-ADMCs for next-generation rechargeable batteries based on conversion reactions. The key challenges that prevent their reversible conversion, the origin of the activity of bifunctional G-ADMCs, and the current design principles of bifunctional G-ADMCs for highly reversible conversion, have been analyzed and highlighted for each conversion-type battery. Finally, a summary and outlook on the development of bifunctional G-ADMC materials for next-generation batteries with a high energy density and excellent energy efficiency are given.",Advanced Materials
Synergistic effect in ultrafine PtNiP nanowires for highly efficient electrochemical hydrogen evolution in alkaline electrolyte,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Platinum-based catalysts play an important role in electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction, which is a renewable and clean way to produce H2. Herein, we have successfully synthesized the ultrafine PtNiP NWs with diameter less than 5 nm via a simple two-step hydrothermal reaction method. Impressively, the PtNiP NWs exhibit one of the best electrocatalytic activity toward HER under alkaline conditions, which can reach current density of 500 mA cm−2 only at the −0.153 V vs RHE with Tafel slop of only 30 mV dec−1. The DFT calculation results show synergistic effect of Pt, Ni and P atoms, where Ni atoms are conducive to the adsorption of H2O and P atoms are helpful for the dissociation of H2O, significantly improving kinetic processes of hydrogen evolution reaction. This work could be instructive and meaningful to design highly efficient and stable HER catalyst in alkaline condition for practical applications.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Multidimensional synergistic architecture of Ti3C2 MXene/CoS2@N-doped carbon for sodium-ion batteries with ultralong cycle lifespan,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) based on conversion-type anode materials exhibit great prospect in the field of large-scale energy storage because of their superior sodiation capacities and low costs. However, poor charge transfer kinetics and short cycle life induced by huge volume change remain two great challenges. Herein, a multidimensional synergistic structure of few-layered Ti3C2 MXene/CoS2@N-doped porous carbon (f-Ti3C2/CoS2@NPC) is rationally designed as SIBs anodes, where N-doped porous carbon matrix-encapsulated ultrafine CoS2 nanoparticles are anchored on few-layered Ti3C2 MXene via Ti[sbnd]O[sbnd]C bonds. The synergistic effects among each component greatly inhibit the aggregation of CoS2 nanoparticles (CoS2 NPs), readily build a long-range electron/Na+ conductive network and effectively provide a dual protection effect on CoS2 NPs during sodiation/desodiation process. Consequently, the f-Ti3C2/CoS2@NPC anode delivers a high-rate performance (282.6 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1) and superior cyclability (200.6 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 1500 cycles). Furthermore, Na3V2(PO4)3//f-Ti3C2/CoS2@NPC full cells can release a high reversible capacity and good cyclability (325.8 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 50 cycles), demonstrating great potential in practical application. This work further broadens the scope of multidimensional synergistic architectures and may inspires more research on MXene-based multidimensional structure for high-performance SIBs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
YF3/CoF3 co-doped 1D carbon nanofibers with dual functions of lithium polysulfudes adsorption and efficient catalytic activity as a cathode for high-performance Li-S batteries,"© 2021Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted extensive attention in the field of energy storage due to their high energy density and low cost. However, conundrums such as severe polarization, poor cyclic performance originating from shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics are stumbling blocks for their practical application. Herein, a novel sulfur cathode integrating sulfur and polyvinylpyrrolidone(PVP)-derived N-doped porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) with embedded CoF3 and YF3 nanoparticles are designed and prepared though the electrostatic blowing technology and carbonization process. The unique flexible PCNFs with embedded polar CoF3 and YF3 nanoparticles not only offer enough voids for volume expansion to maintain the structural stability during the electrochemical process, but also promote the physical encapsulation and chemical entrapment of all sulfur species. Moreover, the uniform distribution of YF3/CoF3 nanoparticles also can expose more binding active sites to lithium polysulfide and present more catalytic sites to the greatest extent. Therefore, the assembled cells with the prepared cathode exhibited stable performances with an outstanding initial capacity of 1055.2 mAh g−1 and an extended cycling stability of 0.029% per cycle during the 300 cycles at 0.5C. Even at a high sulfur loading of 2.1 mg cm−2, The YF3/CoF3 doped-PCNFs exhibited a high discharge specific capacity of 1038 mAh g−1, and the decay rate is also as low as 0.05% over 1000 cycles. This work shares a convenient and safe strategy for the synthesis of multi-dimension, dual-functional and stable superstructure electrode for advanced Li-S batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Transition-metal-free boron doped SbN monolayer for N2 adsorption and reduction to NH3: A first-principles study,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) in ambient condition is an efficient and sustainable method to synthesize NH3. In this work, first-principles study was used to discuss the NRR process on B atom doped SbN monolayer. The adsorption of N2 on B-Sb17N18 and B-S18N17 was calculated including the adsorption energy, adsorption distance, and the charge density difference (CDD). Five different reaction pathways of NRR were taken into consideration and the stability of B-SbN was investigated. The results show that, because the energy of unoccupied orbital in sp3 hybridization of B atom is much lower than that in 2pz orbitals, the adsorption of N2 on B-Sb18N17 shows much larger adsorption energy (−1.01 eV with end-on pattern) compared to that of the adsorption on B-Sb17N18. For five different pathways, the 1, 2, and 4 pathways have a smaller limiting potential of about 0.52 V and the limiting step is: *N2 + H+ + e− → *NNH. The 3 and 5 pathways have a larger limiting potential of 0.57 V with hydrogenation step: *NHNH2 + H+ + e− → *NH2NH2. The B-Sb18N17 is structurally and thermally stable even at 500 K. Our theoretical prediction indicates that B atom substitutionally doped SbN monolayer can be a kind of high-performance metal-free NRR catalyst for NH3 synthetization, and the work provides attempts for designing and exploring 2D metal-free NRR catalysts.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Sulfur encapsulation into yolk-shell Fe2N@nitrogen doped carbon for ambient-temperature sodium-sulfur battery cathode,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na-S) battery represents an advanced energy storage technology because of low cost and large theoretical energy density. However, RT-Na-S battery technology is facing severe challenges such as dissolution of sodium polysulfide, loss of active material on the surface of anode, serious shuttle effect and poor cycle stability. Herein, we synthesis hollow polar iron nitride nanoparticle encased N-doped carbon yolk shell (YS-Fe2N@NC) as sulfur carrier. The synergistic effect of YS-Fe2N@NC as well as wide void can be effectively trap polysulfides and improve the conductivity of sulfur-based cathode. The reversible reaction mechanism of Na-S battery is studied by in/ex-situ characterizations, catalytic behaviour of YS-Fe2N@NC and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

The present work highlights the importance of introducing the Fe2N to catalyse the conversion reactions of polysulfide within NC shell for boosting the RT-Na-S battery in term of high storage capacity, rate capability and stability.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Bimetallic nitride modified separator constructs internal electric field for high-performance lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2021Due to higher theoretical capacity and lower cost, the lithium-sulfur battery gradually replaces the traditional lithium-ion battery. Unfortunately, the shuttle effect of lithium-sulfur batteries is an important factor that hinders their marketization inputs. In this article, we propose an in-situ extrinsic metal etching strategy to activate inert single-metal nitrides through doping methods. The construction of the functional layer on the diaphragm results in an internal electric field directed to the negative electrode between the diaphragm and the negative electrode. The construction of the internal electric field is benefit for the moving of the anions and cations, thereby reducing the dissolution of the polysulfides. Moreover, it is found that the initial capacity reaches 1421 mAh g−1 and the utilization of sulfur reaches 84.83% at 0.1C. The initial capacity is 1280.8 mAh g−1, and there is 466.4 mAh g−1 specific capacity remaining after 1400 cycles and the decay rate is 0.045% at the rate of 1C. Even at the high rate of 5C, the initial capacity is 1097.2 mAh g−1 and the specific capacity of 379.4 mAh g−1 remains after 800 cycles.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Interfacial lithium-nitrogen bond catalyzes sulfide oxidation reactions in high-loading Li2S cathode,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Lithium sulfur batteries have exhibited unparalleled advantages in energy density. However, the sulfide oxidation reactions (SORs) in sulfur cathode are much more sluggish, which is mainly restricted by high conversion barriers. Herein, the catalytic “Li-N” bond sites are designed to activate SORs in high areal loading cathode with the multi-functions of bridging the active materials and carbon matrix tightly. The presence of catalytic “Li-N” bonds is co-revealed by X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy and electronic energy loss spectroscope. As unraveled by theoretical physical van der Waals interaction analysis and various electrochemical tests, the improved kinetics and mechanism of SORs are achieved by motivating polysulfide interconversions and propelling lithium ion diffusion. Consequently, the so-fabricated electrode with abundant Li-N bond catalytic sites deliveries 900 mA h g−1 at 0.05 C and a stable retention of 74.3% at 1 C after 300 cycles. More impressively, high-loading with high-weight-content cathodes remain rapid SORs kinetics, high capacity utilization and retention from 3.0 to 6.9 mg cm−2. At 6.5 mg cm−2, the cathode displays 550 mA h g−1 at 0.76 mA cm−2 corresponded to 3.58 mA h cm−2, which is better than many reports. These results shed light on using intrinsic catalytic sites to realize application of batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Nickel-plated sulfur nanocomposites for electrochemically stable high-loading sulfur cathodes in a lean-electrolyte lithium-sulfur cell,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.An electrochemical sulfur cathode is attractive due to its high theoretical charge-storage capacity, low cost, and natural abundance. For practical viability, a high-performance sulfur cathode with a sufficient sulfur loading/content and stable electrochemical utilization must be developed. However, the satisfaction of these two essential requirements has been proven to be in opposition to each other due to the insulating nature of sulfur and the repeated conversion between solid-/liquid-state active materials that damage the electrochemical efficiency and reversibility. To address these problems, in this work we demonstrate the chemical plating of conductive and electrocatalytic nickel onto sulfur particles to form an electroless-nickel-plated sulfur nanocomposite. This cathode material features a lightweight nickel nanoshell on the surface of the sulfur particles, which enables high electrochemical utilization and kinetics with a high charge-storage capacity (1,008 mA∙h g−1) and excellent rate performance (C/20–C/2). The nickel nanoshell chemically traps and catalyzes the liquid-state active material, resulting in stable long-term cyclability for 200 cycles at various rates. These improved electrochemical characteristics are realized by the enhanced battery properties simultaneously reaching up to a high sulfur loading (14 mg cm−2) and a high sulfur content (74 wt%) with a low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio (7 µL mg−1). With the capability to utilize and stabilize such a high amount of sulfur, the electroless-nickel-plated sulfur cathode demonstrates enhanced areal/gravimetric capacities along with high energy densities (13–28 mW∙h cm−2) that are comparable to those of the current available lithium-ion oxide cathodes (10–14 mW∙h cm−2).",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Carbon-based single atom catalyst: Synthesis, characterization, DFT calculations","© 2021Carbon-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomic sizes of active sites have become the promising candidates for a variety of catalytic systems because of their high atom utilization, and unique electronic structures.

Controlling metallic Co0 in ZIF-67-derived N-C/Co composite catalysts for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction 调控ZIF-67衍生N-C/Co复合催化剂中的金属性Co0 实现高效光催化CO2还原,"© 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.An efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction has been reported in ZIF-67-derived-Co nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon layers (N-C/Co). This work demonstrates that the pyrolysis temperature is crucial in tuning the grain size and components of metallic Co0 of N-C/Co composite catalysts, which optimizes their photocatalytic activities. Syntheses were conducted at 600, 700, and 800°C giving the N-C/Co-600, N-C/Co-700, and N-C/Co-800 samples, respectively. N-C layers can well wrap the Co NPs obtained at a low pyrolysis temperature (600°C) owing to their smaller grains than those of other samples. A high metallic Co0 content in the N-C/Co-600 sample can be attributed to the effective inhibition of surface oxidation. By contrast, the surface CoOx oxides in the N-C/Co-700 and N-C/Co-800 samples cover inside Co cores, inhibiting charge separation and transfer. As a result, the N-C/Co-600 sample yields the best photocatalytic activity. The carbon monoxide and hydrogen generation rates are as high as 1.62 × 104 and 2.01 × 104 µmol g−1 h−1, respectively. Additionally, the Co NPs make composite catalysts magnetic, enabling rapid and facile recovery of catalysts with the assistance of an external magnetic field. This work is expected to provide an instructive guideline for designing metal-organic framework-derived carbon/metal composite catalysts.",Science China Materials
Decorating CoSe2 on N-doped carbon nanotubes as catalysts and efficient polysulfides traps for Li-S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have attracted wide attention as one of the most potential secondary batteries in the next generation. However, the low sulfur utilization, serious “shuttle effect”, and large volume expansion of the sulfur cathode restrict the performance of LSBs. Here, CoSe2 decorated hollow N-doped carbon nanotubes (CoSe2/hNCTs) were synthesized firstly, and then the CoSe2/hNCTs were used as a sulfur host to prepare a multifunctional CoSe2/hNCTs/S cathode. DFT calculations confirm that the CoSe2 not only efficiently adsorbs lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), but also exhibits good catalytic performance for the conversion of LiPSs. SEM and TEM images indicate that the CoSe2 uniformly disperses on the surface of the polypyrrole nanotube-derived hNCTs, like plum blossoms. The hNCTs with a morphology of plum blossom branches provide a high conductive network and prohibit large volume expansion during the electrochemical process. And the plum petal-like CoSe2 on the hNCTs surface acts as a catalyst and an efficient polysulfides trap.

Well-defined coordination environment breaks the bottleneck of organic synthesis: Single-atom palladium catalyzed hydrosilylation of internal alkynes,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Single-atom site (SAS) catalysts have attracted considerable attention due to their excellent performance. However, most of the current research models of SAS catalysts are based on inorganic catalysts, where “metal and coordination atom interaction” cannot simulate the fine-tuning effect of organic ligands on metal catalytic centers in homogeneous catalysts. Therefore, certain chemical transformations in homogeneous catalysis cannot be perfectly replicated. Here, we used porous organic ligand polymers as the carrier, which effectively changes the charge regulation of nanoparticles and monoatomic metal catalysts. Drawing lessons from traditional homogeneous metal/ligand catalysis, we introduced various functional groups into the ligand polymers to adjust the electronic properties, and successfully realized the hydrosilylation of internal alkynes with high catalytic performance. The selectivity and catalytic efficiency under the Pd@POL-1 catalyst system were improved compared with previous studies. The internal alkynes with various structures can complete this reaction, and the ratio of E/Z can reach up to 100:1. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research
Immobilizing VN ultrafine nanocrystals on N-doped carbon nanosheets enable multiple effects for high-rate lithium—sulfur batteries,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The exploitation of new sulfiphilic and catalytic materials is considered as the promising strategy to overcome severe shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics conversion of lithium polysulfides within lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, we design and fabricate monodisperse VN ultrafine nanocrystals immobilized on nitrogen-doped carbon hybrid nanosheets (VN@NCSs) via an one-step in-situ self-template and self-reduction strategy, which simultaneously promotes the interaction with polysulfides and the kinetics of the sulfur conversion reactions demonstrated by experimental and theoretical results. By virtue of the multifunctional structural features of VN@NCSs, the cell with ultrathin VN@NCSs (only 5 µm thickness) modified separator indicates improved electrochemical performances with long cycling stability over 1,000 cycles at 2 C with only 0.041% capacity decay per cycle and excellent rate capability (787.6 mAh·g−1 at 10 C). Importantly, it delivers an areal reversible capacity of 3.71 mAh·cm−2 accompanied by robust cycling life. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research
High-throughput screening of carbon-supported single metal atom catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Carbon-supported transition metal single atoms are promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. Since there are many types of carbon supports and transition metals, the accurate prediction of the components with high activity through theoretical calculations can greatly save experimental time and costs. In this work, the ORR catalytic properties of 180 types single-atom catalysts (SACs) composed of the eight representative carbon-based substrates (graphdiyne, C2N, C3N4, phthalocyanine, C-coordination graphene, N-coordination graphene, covalent organic frameworks and metal-organic frameworks) and 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal elements are investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The adsorption free energy of OH* is proved a universal descriptor capable of accurately prediction of the ORR catalytic activity. It is found that the oxygen reduction reaction overpotentials of all the researched SACs follow one volcano shape very well with the adsorption free energy of OH*. Phthalocyanine, N-coordination graphene and metal-organic frameworks stand out as the promising supports for single metal atom due to the relatively lower overpotentials. Notably, the Co-doped metal-organic frameworks, Ir-doped phthalocyanine, Co-doped N-coordination graphene, Co-doped graphdiyne and Rh-doped phthalocyanine show extremely low overpotentials comparable to that of Pt (111). The study provides a guideline for design and selection of carbon-supported SACs toward oxygen reduction reaction. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research
Suitable lithium polysulfides diffusion and adsorption on CNTs@TiO2-bronze nanosheets surface for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) has been hampered their commercialization. Metal oxides as separator modifications can suppress the shuttle effect. Since there is no direct electron transport between metal oxides and LiPSs, absorbed LiPSs should be diffused from the surface of metal oxides to the carbon matrix to go through redox reactions. If diffusivity of LiPSs from metal oxides surface to carbon substrate is poor, it would hinder the redox reactions of LiPSs. Nevertheless, researchers tend to focus on the adsorption and overlook the diffusion of LiPSs. Herein, same morphology and different crystal phase of TiO2 nanosheets grown on carbon nanotubes (CNTs@TiO2-bronze and CNTs@TiO2-anatase) have been designed via a simple approach. Compared with CNTs and CNTs@TiO2-anatase composites, the battery with CNTs@TiO2-bronze modified separator delivers higher specific capacities and stronger cycling stability, especially at high current rates (∼ 472 mAh·g−1 at 2.0 C after 1,000 cycles). Adsorption tests, density functional theory calculations and electrochemical performance evaluations indicate that suitable diffusion and adsorption for LiPSs on the CNTs@TiO2-B surface can effectively capture LiPSs and promote the redox reaction, leading to the superior cycling performances.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research
Engineering the atomic interface of porous ceria nanorod with single palladium atoms for hydrodehalogenation reaction,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Tuning the electronic properties of single atom catalysts (SACs) between the central metal and the neighboring surface atoms has emerged as an efficient strategy to boost catalytic efficiency and metal utilization. Here we describe a simple and efficient approach to create atomically dispersed palladium atoms supported over defect-containing porous ceria nanorod containing palladium up to 0.26 wt.%. The existence of singly dispersed palladium atoms is confirmed by spherical aberration correction electron microscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements. This catalyst shows excellent efficiency in hydrodehalogenation reactions at low H2 pressure under mild conditions, along with satisfactory recyclability and scalability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the high activity stems from the spatial isolation of palladium atoms and the modified electronic structure of palladium confined in defect-containing ceria nanorod. This work may lay the foundation for the facile creation of single atom catalysts within the synthetic community and shed light on the possibility for scale-up production.

Atom-level interfacial synergy of single-atom site catalysts for electrocatalysis,"© 2021 Science PressSingle-atom site catalysts (SACs) have made great achievements due to their nearly 100% atomic utilization and uniform active sites. Regulating the surrounding environment of active sites, including electron structure and coordination environment via atom-level interface regulation, to design and construct an advanced SACs is of great significance for boosting electrocatalytic reactions. In this review, we systemically summarized the fundamental understandings and intrinsic mechanisms of SACs for electrocatalytic applications based on the interface site regulations. We elaborated the several different regulation strategies of SACs to demonstrate their ascendancy in electrocatalytic applications. Firstly, the interfacial electronic interaction was presented to reveal the electron transfer behavior of active sites. Secondly, the different coordination structures of metal active center coordinated with two or three non-metal elements were also summarized.

Finally, we outlooked the limitations, perspectives and challenges of SACs based on atomic interface regulation.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
An ultrathin and highly efficient interlayer for lithium-sulfur batteries with high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered to have great potential due to their high theoretical specific energy and natural abundance of sulfur. However, the practical specific energy and cycle life of Li-S pouch cells are significantly hindered by thin sulfur cathodes, flooded electrolytes and excess Li metal anodes. Here, an ultrathin and highly efficient boron nitride/single-wall carbon nanotube (BN/SWCNT) interlayer (UHEI) achieves excellent Li-S pouch cell performance with high sulfur loading and a lean electrolyte. Compared with the reported interlayer materials, the UHEI can not only hinder the diffusion of polysulfides, but also promote further redox reactions and allow Li+ to pass through easily. Meanwhile, this UHEI can significantly improve lean electrolyte performance (E/S ratio of 8 μL mg−1) and both high and low plateau capacities of Li-S batteries with a high sulfur loading (10 mg cm−2). Moreover, a normalized “ratio of the areal loading interlayer to sulfur (I/S)” was proposed and two “interlayer efficiency index (IEI)” were obtained by using I/S to quantify the efficiency of interlayers at a certain current density and guide the design of high-efficiency interlayers. The IEI of our UHEI@PP is dozens of times higher than previously reported results. Li-S cells with UHEI@PP delivered a remarkable discharge capacity of 6.6 mA h cm−2 after 100 cycles at 0.2C for pouch cells (4.1 mg cm−2 per side, E/S ratio of 10 μL mg−1).

Metal-organic frameworks for the electrocatalytic ORR and HER,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.The development of low-cost electrocatalysts with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and durability is one of the key requirements for the commercialization of fuel cells technologies. Additionally, a facile hydrogen production as fuel using electrocatalysts is equally important for the development of hydrogen fuel cells technology. Among available low-cost electrocatalysts such as single atoms electrocatalysts, metal oxides, phosphides and sulfides, MN4-type molecular catalysts etc., the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-based materials is found to be one of the potential electrocatalysts for ORR and hydrogen production. Because of their several merits such as (1) well-defined architecture with exact location of active sites and structure-activity relationships, (2) chemically adjustable and well-defined pore-size architecture, (3) suitably incorporation of redox-active moieties in MOFs to initiate the charge transfer to improve the intrinsic electrical conductivity, and (4) well-characterized reaction pathways. In this chapter, we highlighted the (1) engineering and effective strategies for the fabrication of MOFs-based electrocatalysts, (2) several recent advancements on MOFs-based materials for ORR as well as hydrogen production, and (3) to emphasize some future aspects from the MOFs engineering for ORR electrocatalysis.",Nanomaterials for Electrocatalysis
Lattice distortion of crystalline-amorphous nickel molybdenum sulfide nanosheets for high-efficiency overall water splitting: Libraries of lone pairs of electrons and: In situ surface reconstitution,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lattice distortion is an important way to improve the electrocatalytic performance and stability of two-dimensional transition metal materials (2d-TMSs). Herein, a lattice distortion nickel-molybdenum sulfide electrocatalyst on foam nickel (NiMoS4-12/NF) has been synthesized through a novel, simple, and effective crystalline-amorphous strategy. The electrocatalyst only requires 1.47 V to obtain 10 mA cm-2 for overall water splitting (OWS) and can function stably for 100 h at a current density of 100 mA cm-2, demonstrating an excellent electrocatalytic performance and stability. From the results of the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), it can be seen that the (104) crystal lattice of NiMoS4-12 undergoes interface strain under the crystalline-amorphous state, resulting in rich sulfur defects caused by lattice distortion, which could improve the intrinsic catalytic activity of NiMoS4-12. According to the differential charge density analysis, around the sulfur defects, the Mo and Ni atoms with abundant lone pairs of electrons acted as libraries of lone pairs of electrons to enable an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). From the total density of states (TDOS) and the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH∗), the libraries of lone pairs of electrons not only effectively optimized the distribution of the surface electron density of states at the Fermi level, but also reduced the ΔGH∗, thereby improving the intrinsic HER electrocatalytic performance. The in situ Raman test results demonstrate that during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the surface of the nickel molybdenum sulfide was reconstructed, and highly active Ni-OOH was generated. From the calculated free energy diagrams, the Ni-OOH could optimize the reaction barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS) for the OER to enhance the slow oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. This work will contribute to the rational design of a 2d-TMSs electrocatalyst, as well as investigation of the catalytic mechanism. This journal is",Nanoscale

An anisotropic dressed pairwise potential model for the adsorption of noble gases on boron nitride sheets,"© the Owner Societies.Development of empirical potentials with accurate parameterization is indispensable while modeling large-scale systems. Herein, we report accurate parameterization of an anisotropic dressed pairwise potential model (PPM) for probing the adsorption of noble gases, He, Ne, Ar and Kr on boron nitride sheets. For the noble gas binding on B48N48H24, we carried out a least-squares fit analysis of the dispersion and dispersionless contributions of the interaction potential separately. The transferability of the parameters for a range of molecular model systems of boron nitride is further established. The dressed PPM is then used in conjunction with a global optimization technique, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) to assess the possibility of performing large-scale simulations with the PPM-PSO methodology. The results obtained for the adsorption of 2-5 noble gases on BN sheets establish the proof-of-concept, encouraging the pursuit of large-scale simulations using the PPM-PSO approach.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics

Transitional metal sulfides (TMSs) have gained great research interest owing to their high intrinsic catalytic activity, adjustable electronic structures, and various crystal structures and phases. Meanwhile, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are ideal precursors for the preparation of TMSs due to the diverse metal nodes, organic ligands, topologies, and morphologies of MOFs. In addition, MOFs could act as hosts for the incorporation of guest molecules, which could further expand the metal types of TMSs. In this review, the recent progress of MOF-derived TMS electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs), oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) are summarized. After a brief introduction to the reaction mechanisms, the preparation strategies, structures, catalytic performances, and catalytic mechanisms of the TMSs are discussed to give readers a comprehensive understanding of this prosperous field. The strategies such as nanostructure engineering, interface engineering and heteroatom doping used to improve the performance of the electrocatalysts are discussed in each section. In addition, bifunctional catalytic performances of the catalysts for overall water splitting and rechargeable Zn-air batteries are illustrated. Furthermore, challenges and opportunities for the future development of this field are proposed.

Piezoelectricity in Monolayer and Multilayer Ti3C2Tx MXenes: Implications for Piezoelectric Devices,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyPiezoelectricity of two-dimensional (2D) materials with a noncentrosymmetric atomic structure is important to be studied and can be widely applied in many areas. Ti3C2Tx, as a kind of MXene, is able to be modified with functional groups and loses its central symmetry. Here, the mechanical-piezoelectric coupling equations of the Ti3C2Tx MXene with narrow band gaps are proposed to reveal the origin of piezoelectricity in monolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene. The multilayer 2D structure presents the extraordinary piezoelectric properties of the Ti3C2Tx MXene. Then, the modulation of the Schottky barrier by continuous piezoelectric potential distribution in Ti3C2Tx MXene and the nonuniform distribution of piezoelectric potential between unique polyatomic layer structures are described through the establishment of theoretical model, which explains the origin of the high conversion efficiency. Finally, the piezoelectric effect in multilayer Ti3C2Tx MXene as the circular piezoelectric resonator is analyzed. It is believed that the establishment of the atomic piezoelectric polarization model provides a solid foundation for understanding the piezoelectric mechanism in the Ti3C2Tx MXene and the preparation of piezoelectric devices such as a piezoelectric tactile sensor system, piezoelectric nanogenerator, and nanopiezoelectric resonator.",ACS Applied Nano Materials

Three-Dimensional Electrodes for Oxygen Electrocatalysis,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHRechargeable metal-air batteries have drawn extensive attention because of their remarkably high theoretical energy output and the ultra-stable voltage platform but are restricted by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions at the cathode. To resolve this issue, great efforts have been made in focusing the three-dimensional (3D) electrodes, which can provide adequate hierarchical channels and ensure the gas penetration of the air electrodes. Therefore, it is necessary to give a timely updates of 3D electrodes.

Enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction of boron-doped reduced graphene oxide via ultrasonic treatment,"© 2021 The Author(s)Commercial polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells have relied on scares Platinum to catalyse the kinetically sluggish oxygen reduction reaction occurring at their anodes. Over the last decade organic materials, frequently based on graphitic structures have been demonstrated as promising alternative electrocatalysts to the noble metals. Researchers typically utilize ultrasonic treatment as part of the synthesis procedure to achieve homogeneous dispersion of graphitic carbon prior to. Herein we investigate the implications of the structural and compositional changes induced by the ultrasonication treatment on boron-doped reduced graphene oxide for oxygen reduction reaction. It is shown that ultrasonication pre-treatment prior to the boron doping and reduction of graphene oxide via hydrothermal process step leads to the increase of both substitutional B and electrocatalytic surface area, with associated reduction of average pore size diameter, leading to a significant improvement in the oxygen reduction reaction performance, with respect to the non-ultrasonicated material. It is proposed that the higher degree of substitutional doping of boron is a result of formation of the additional epoxy functionalities on graphitic planes, which act as a doping site for boric acid.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
Lithium-Ion Storage Mechanism in Metal-N-C Systems: A First-Principles Study,"© 2022 The Authors. Published by American Chemical SocietyIn metal-N-C systems, doped metals have an obvious valence change in the process of Li-ion deintercalation, which is in agreement with the operational principle of traditional anode materials. Doped metals will transfer some electrons to the neighboring N atoms to improve the valence state. Along with Li adsorption, the charge transferred to the nearest N or C from Li is less compared to that transferred to the doped metal. Hence, doped metals have an obvious valence change in the process of Li-ion deintercalation, and doped N just serves as a container for holding electrons. The local states of C and N p electrons in the Co-N-C structure can be fully destroyed, which can effectively improve the electronic properties of graphene.",ACS Omega
Unraveling the photoconduction characteristics of single-step synthesized CuS and Cu9S5 micro-flowers,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Owing to the alteration in the fundamental properties even by a slight variation in Cu/S ratio, the Cu–S system has been complicated and its role in photoconductive devices has been rarely investigated. Herein, CuS and Cu9S5 micro-flowers have been synthesized via a single-step solvothermal process and their photoconductors have been fabricated to unveil the optoelectronic characteristics. By increasing a Cu/S ratio from CuS to Cu9S5, the reduction in bandgap from 1.60 to 1.09 eV has been observed. In addition, the impact of bandgap on conductivity under dark and light has been investigated. Under Halogen light exposure, ~110 times increase in the photocurrent for Cu9S5 has been observed than CuS. The detectivity and responsivity of CuS and Cu9S5 were obtained to be 9.26 × 105, 6.1 × 106 Jones and 1.37 × 10−8, 1 × 10−6 A/W under Halogen light. In addition, the Cu9S5 photoconductor attained maximum responsivity, 2.5 × 10−4 A/W, and detectivity, 2.3 × 1010 Jones at 980 nm. More importantly, the photoconduction mechanism for CuS and Cu9S5 has been studied in-depth and the role of the Cu/S ratio on the photoconductivity has been evaluated.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Ruthenium-Doping-Induced Amorphization of VS4Nanostructures with a Rich Sulfur Vacancy for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in a Neutral Electrolyte Medium,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The generation of pure H2 from a neutral electrolyte solution represents a transformative route with low cost and environmentally friendly nature. However, the complex kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via water electrolysis make its practical application to be difficult. Herein, we have reported Ru-doping-induced formation of VS4 nanostructures with a rich S vacancy for neutral HER in a 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution. The Ru-doped VS4 demands an overpotential value of 160 mV at 10 mA/cm2 current density with a lower catalyst loading of 0.1 mg/cm2, while pristine VS4 demands a 374 mV overpotential with the same mass loading. 60 hours of chronoamperometric study reveals the excellent stability of Ru-doped VS4 materials, which is the highest amount of time ever reported for neutral HER. The marginal degradation of a catalyst under a long-term stability study was confirmed through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis. The introduction of Ru to the VS4 lattice leads to a 4.35-fold increase in the turnover-frequency values compared to those of bare VS4 nanostructures. The higher HER activity of S-vacancy-enriched VS4 materials is thought to originate through effective water adsorption in S vacancy and Ru3+ sites followed by the dissociation of a H2O molecule, and S22- efficiently converts Had to H2. Also, post-HER characterization reveals that the transformation of some Ru3+ to Ru0 additionally favored the HER by providing a better H adsorption site under a static cathodic potential.",Inorganic Chemistry
Insight into the Inhibition of Shuttle by Metal-Modified Covalent Triazine Frameworks and Graphene Composites with the Solvent Interaction in Lithium Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides is a key problem that has degraded the performance and limited the commercialization of lithium sulfur batteries. Currently, the composites with covalent triazine frameworks (M-CTFs) modified by metals in the fourth period and graphene (M-CTF/G, M = Li, Ti ∼Zn) were designed as host cathodes and are expected to inhibit the shuttling effect through the modification by the polar metal. Using density functional theory, it was demonstrated that M-CTF/G displayed synergistic adsorption performance of Li2S4 with unsaturated metal-N3 coordinated groups as active sites in the M-CTF. In addition, three solvents with different dielectric constants and polarity, namely, dioxolane, dimethoxyethanedimethyl, and tetramethylurea, were used to investigate the solvent effect, and the effective adsorption energy range of Li2S4 on M-CTF/G was evaluated in the presence of solvents.

Herein, a self-template strategy was proposed to fabricate a spherical MOF (S-terephthalic acid-MOF, S-Co-Ni-PTA-MOF) via thermal transformation from a crystalline-sheet MOF. The as-prepared spherical MOF with a controllable size has an ultrahigh specific surface area (increased by 2.43 times), abundant pore distribution and good crystallinity. Multifarious morphological, spectral and dimensional techniques were implemented to understand the formation mechanism and influencing factors of the spherical MOF. S-Co-Ni/N-C-T with hierarchical pores yielded a hollow carbon sphere with a complicated surface during carbonization in N2 with melamine supplementation. Co-Ni and N-doped micro- and mesoporous carbon were applied to enhance the ORR performance to improve the power generation of microbial fuel cells.

Insights into the diverse precursor-based micro-spherical hard carbons as anode materials for sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.In the past decade, the growth of the renewable energy sector worldwide and the depleting resources for Li-ion battery (LIB) technology have pushed the case for complementary storage technologies, especially for stationary energy storage. Sodium-ion batteries (SIB) are on the verge of large-scale commercialization, and potassium-ion battery (PIB) technology is a relative newcomer in the field of future storage technologies. Suitable, low-cost, and environmentally benign commercial electrode materials are the most researched battery systems in this context. Like LIBs, carbonaceous materials can potentially be the first commercial anode material for sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries. Micro-spherical hard carbons (MSHCs) have the added advantage of higher packing density and low surface area to volume ratio with good structural stability. The metal-ion storage capacity is critically dependent on the morphology, surface area, surface defects, degree of graphitization, and porosity. The review addresses the influence of diverse precursors and synthesis conditions on the electrochemical storage of micro-spherical hard carbons, focusing on the storage-capacity and storage-mechanism correlation and the precursors' structural influence in designing anodes for sustainable, green, and safe SIBs and PIBs.",Materials Advances
Constructing multi-functional composite separator of PVDF-HFP/h-BN supported Co-CNF membrane for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The functional design of separators has been proved to be one of the most efficient methods to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this work, a multifunctional separator with gradual changes to four aspects was constructed by integrating a PVDF-HFP/h-BN membrane with a Co-doped carbon nanofiber. The architecture has four gradations, which offers multifold advantages. First, in terms of density, there is a transition from loose to dense, which results in a higher electrolyte uptake rate, reduces the amount of free electrolyte and further suppresses the shuttle effect. Additionally, in terms of composition, a transition from inorganic to organic is designed, which allows the inorganic and organic components to bind closely and reduces the interfacial resistance. Meanwhile, there is a transition from high electronic conductivity to insulation. The change in electronic conductivity leads to effective conversion of the polysulfide. Finally, in terms of ionic conductivity, there is a transition from low to high, which gives the separator better ability to conduct lithium ions. As a consequence, a battery with the as-constructed multifunctional separator performs with good capacity stability, which demonstrates a new concept for high-performance lithium-sulfur battery design.",Sustainable Energy and Fuels
A COF-like conductive conjugated microporous poly(aniline) serving as a current collector modifier for high-performance Li–S batteries,"This journal is © The Royal Society of ChemistryConducting polymers such as polyaniline have demonstrated their considerable superiorities when serving as promising sulfur host materials for Li–S batteries, owing to their strong affinity for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and excellent conductivity. However, less polar groups, an unstable frame structure and low specific surface area limited their electrochemical performance. Herein, a covalent organic framework (COF)-like conjugated microporous polyaniline (CMPA) with an extended π-conjugated system and permanent 3D microporosity was developed as a modified material for use in the current collector of the sulfur cathode for highly efficient Li–S batteries. This multifunctional CMPA shows the integrated nature of conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) and PANi, ensuring exceptionally specific surface area, nitrogen-rich character, stable framework and high conductivity. Owing to these superiorities, the current collector modified by CMPA delivers a high areal capacity (7.42 mA h cm−2) and high energy density (202.8 W h kgcell−1) even under a sulfur loading of 8.72 mg cm−2. These outcomes present a new strategy for designing advanced cathodes and also demonstrate the potential of CMPs in energy storage batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Uniform coverage of high-loading sulfur on cross-linked carbon nanofibers for high reaction kinetics in Li–S batteries with low electrolyte/sulfur ratio,"This journal is © The Royal Society of ChemistryThe aggregation of high-loading sulfur on host materials at low carbon/sulfur (C/S) ratio results in limited S ↔ Li2S reaction kinetics and the shuttle effect of polysulfide, which is a bottleneck for the development of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries with high energy densities. Herein, we demonstrate that uniform coverage of high loading amount of sulfur on a cross-linked carbon nanofiber network (TiC@CNF) can be achieved in Li–S batteries, which was realized by the denseness and well distribution of pores in the three-dimensional weave of TiC@CNF. It significantly increases the reaction kinetics and inhibits the shuttle effect under lean electrolyte conditions. Impressively, at a sulfur loading of as high as 12.5 mg cm−2 (S/C ratio, 4.56), the areal capacity of Li–S batteries with TiC@CNF can maintain over 9 mA h cm−2 for 150 cycles at an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6 μL mg−1. The cathode structure design for high-loading sulfur provides a powerful strategy to realize fast S ↔ Li2S reaction kinetics in the high energy density Li–S batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

To completely exploit their potential beyond the existing boundaries, unique functional nanostructures, monolayers, multilayer compounds, nanoparticles, and composites have been prepared through functionalization, hybridization, intercalation, etc. MXenes have shown novel and tunable properties, easy processing, and superior electrochemical performance, which make them potential candidates for application in electrochemical energy storage. Herein, we present a forward-looking review of MXene-based materials with their synthesis protocol, fundamental properties, and state-of-the-art electrochemical activity and performance in supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries. Finally, we discuss the challenges that must be addressed for future research, which will deepen the basic understanding of MXenes and their derivatives to promote further advancements in burgeoning energy storage technologies.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
A flame-retardant polyimide interlayer with polysulfide lithium traps and fast redox conversion towards safety and high sulfur utilization Li-S batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.In recent years and following the progress made in lithium-ion battery technology, substantial efforts have been devoted to developing practical lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries for next-generation commercial energy storage devices. The practical application of Li-S batteries is still limited by dramatically reduced capacities, cycling instabilities, and safety issues arising from flammable components. In this study, we designed and fabricated a flame-retardant, multifunctional interlayer which integrated electroconductive networks, lithium polysulfide (LiPS) traps and catalysts to significantly elevate the electrochemical performance and safety of pristine Li-S batteries. The LiPS adsorptive polymer polyimide (PI) constrains polysulfides to the cathode region and effectively suppresses the shuttle effect. Coralloid PI/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MCNT) compounds provide plentiful reaction sites for active materials. The catalytic Ni on the metal skeleton surface notably promotes Li+ diffusion, lowers the redox overpotential and accelerates LiPS conversion, which improves the redox kinetics associated with sulfur-related species and significantly elevates sulfur utilization. At different current densities of 0.2 C and 0.5 C, impressive initial discharge capacities of 1275.3 mA h g-1 and 1190.9 mA h g-1 are attainable respectively, with high capacity retentions of 80.3% and 78.6% over 600 cycles. Besides, the multifunctional interlayer can also act as a flame-retardant layer to promote the safety of Li-S batteries by inhibiting the spread of fire. This study provides a feasible and prospective strategy that adopts a multifunctional interlayer to develop Li-S batteries with higher capacities, longer cycling lives and safer working conditions.

"Advances in porous organic polymers: Syntheses, structures, and diverse applications","© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Porous organic polymers (POPs) are organic macromolecules that are considered emerging materials because of their high specific surface areas, tunable porosities, low densities, high chemical and thermal stabilities, variable compositions, convenient post-functionalization, extended π-conjugations, and their high contents of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and other non-metallic atoms. POPs have been classified into four types: covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), hypercrosslinked polymers (HCPs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs). These materials have potential applications in, for example, gas capture/separation, energy storage, H2 production from water, photocatalysis, chemical sensing, perovskite solar cells, water treatment, optical devices, and biomedicine. In this review, we provide an overview of recent reports describing the preparation and various applications of POPs.",Materials Advances
Race on High-loading Metal Single Atoms and Successful Preparation Strategies,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Although single-atom catalysts (SACs) show significantly higher catalytic performance compared to conventional and nanoparticle-based catalysts (NPs) at the same amount of metal loading, their overall catalytic performance may still be unable to compete with the NPs in many applications due to the limited active sites. Generally, trace amounts of metal (less than 1 wt%) can be successfully loaded onto supports in an atomically-dispersed feature, and higher metal loading usually results in aggregation of the metal atoms. Hence, it is very important to further increase the density of isolated metal atoms in these rising-star SACs to pave the ways for widespread applications or even to replace the NPs. On the other hand, it is well known that this is one of the most challenging topics on SACs research. In this review, the advanced strategies to overcome this challenge and achieve high loading of isolated metal atoms on various supports will be extensively discussed together with the examples showing the research efforts to enrich the metal active sites from the pioneer works with metal loading below 0.2 wt% to the recently-reported SACs with metal loading over 20 wt%. Besides, there are still plenty of rooms to further improve the quantity and quality of metal loading on different supports, and outlooks of this scope is provided. We hope that this comprehensive review aids in the development of synthesis techniques for the new-generation SACs with richer active sites.",ChemCatChem
Structural Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks Comprising Two Electron Acceptors Improves Photocatalytic Performance,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHCovalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently attracted much attention as potential photocatalysts for hydrogen production. The effective separation of photogenerated charges is a key objective to improve the photocatalytic activity of COFs. Here, four COFs were synthesized through the Schiff-base reaction to investigate whether the presence (simultaneous or not) of triazine and ketone as acceptors in COFs improved electron-hole separation efficiency. Evidence indicated that charge separation was more efficient when triazine and ketone were simultaneously present in the COF. The COF comprising two acceptors displayed the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production rate (31.43 μmol h−1; 41.2 and 3.4 times as large as those of the COFs containing only triazine or ketone, respectively). Moreover, the effect of the distance between the two acceptors on the electron-hole separation was investigated by changing the length of a bridging biphenyl ring. It turned out that the transport distance of a single phenyl group was more favorable for the catalytic reaction. This work affords insight and support for the design of efficient COF photocatalysts.",ChemSusChem

Herein, cobalt (Co) nanoparticles embedded inside nitrogen (N)-doped hierarchical porous carbon (MgCo-HC) are prepared via one-pot approach. As a result, MgCo-HC unique structure with the large surface area and Co, N-doping is proposed for the strong physical/chemical adsorption of PSs, high conductivity, fast redox reaction kinetics and the high S utilization. The resultant S cathode delivers a high specific capacity of 1086.4 mA h/g at 0.1 C, low-capacity fading rate of 0.041% per cycle over 880 cycles at 2 C, and superior rate performance up to 5 C. More intriguingly, the S/MgCo-HC electrode delivers reversible area capacities of 5.1 and 5.5 mA h/cm2 at 0.1 C under high S loading and learn electrolyte condition, respectively. Furthermore, the assembled Li-S soft-packaged battery is also readily assembled, which highlights stable electrochemical properties under folding conditions. This work provides a simple strategy to design advanced S hosts for the practical application of Li-S batteries with excellent electrochemical performance.",Electrochimica Acta
Dual Rate-Modulation Approach for the Preparation of Crystalline Covalent Triazine Frameworks Displaying Efficient Sodium Storage,"© A dual rate-modulation approach was implemented for the first time to create crystalline covalent triazine frameworks. Based on a new polycondensation approach, regulating the condensation rate via the exploitation of a modulated aldehyde monomer and addition of an extrinsic inhibitor affords inherent control over the polymer growth and therefore provides tunable crystallinities and porosities for the resulting triazine frameworks. The existence of rich redox-active triazine linkages gives rise to obtaining exceptional sodium storage, where 239 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 is obtained after 200 cycles. We anticipate this new protocol based on the dynamic imine metathesis will facilitate new possibilities for the construction of crystalline covalent triazine frameworks and promote their energy-related applications.",ACS Macro Letters
"Improving the Sodium Storage Performance of Porous Carbon Derived From Covalent Organic Frameworks Through N, S Co-Doping","Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Zhang, Zhang, Sun, Hu and Wang.Heteroatom doping, which has long been considered as one of the most efficient approaches to significantly enhance the sodium storage ability of carbonaceous anodes, has drawn increasing attention. Compared with single doping, dual doping can introduce more defects and accelerate ionic diffusion. In addition, the synergistic effect between the dual doped atoms can significantly improve the electrochemical performances. Besides, exploring novel precursors with excellent properties, which can induce porous structure and rapid pathways for electrons/ions in the resultant carbonaceous anode, is still full of challenges. Herein, nitrogen and sulfur–co-doped urchin-like porous carbon (NSC) was fabricated through a combined strategy including carbonization and subsequent sulfidation, using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as precursors. Because of the dual doping–endowed rich defects, high electronic conductivity, and favorable capacitive behavior, the resultant NSC exhibited excellent sodium storage performances, delivering superior sodium storage capacity (483.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles) and excellent cycling stability up to 1,000 cycles (231.6 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1). Importantly, such remarkable electrochemical performances of the resultant carbonaceous anode may shed light on the efficient conversion of COFs to functional materials.",Frontiers in Materials
Synthesis of Titanium Molybdenum Nitride-Decorated Electrospun Carbon Nanofiber Membranes as Interlayers to Suppress Polysulfide Shuttling in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is seriously restricted by the ""shuttle effect""of polysulfide ions. The design of functional interlayers is one of the effective solutions to overcome this defect. In this work, titanium molybdenum nitride (TMN) solid solution nanoparticles have been successfully decorated on electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNFs) to form a continuous flexible TMN@CNF membrane through a one-step calcination process under NH3 atmosphere. By regulating the mass ratio of titanium acetylacetonate TiO(acac)2 and molybdenum acetylacetonate MoO2(acac)2, the dissolved amount of Mo into TiN can be precisely controlled. Through the visible adsorption test, cyclic voltammetry test of Li2S6-based symmetric cells, and potentiostatic discharge measurement, such a TMN@CNF membrane has been confirmed to exhibit excellent adsorption and catalytic capacity on lithium polysulfides. With the help of DFT calculations, the adsorption capacity of TMN phase is confirmed to be greatly enhanced when compared with that of TiN, which can be attributed to the improved overlap of the electronic state after the introduction of Mo to TiN. By using such a membrane as the interlayer in Li-S batteries, it can effectively increase the cell's initial capacity to 1205 mA h g-1 at 0.5 C when the dissolved amount of Mo reaches 50%. At the current density of 2 C, the discharge capacity of the cell by using such a multifunctional interlayer can reach up to 947 mA h g-1 and remains at 390 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles, corresponding to a 0.059% capacity decay per cycle. This work provides a feasible method to prepare a flexible interlayer with a regulated electronic fine structure and strong chemisorption and catalytic ability for the development of the high performance Li-S batteries.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
Zwitterionic microporous polymer with selective ion transport for durable lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdFunctional separator which facilitates the fast transport of Li+ but obstructs the permeation of polysulfides is highly required for durable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Here, we report a facile approach to developing such functional separator by coating the commercial polypropylene separator with a unique solution-processable polymer featuring both intrinsic microporosity and ion-selective functionality. The polymer is designed with contorted and rigid backbones, which incorporates zwitterionic side chains with both sulfophilic and lithiophilic groups, to produce confined ionic channels for selective ion transport via the chemical interactions with lithium polysulfides. Therefore, when used in the cell configuration, the as-developed functional separator can not only allow the fast Li+ conduction but also obstruct the penetration of bulky polysulfides, thus resulting in obvious shuttle suppression as well as the resultant credible and stable sulfur electrochemistry. Thanks to these advantages, the Li-S batteries implementing the as-developed functional separator possess high cycling ability and decent rate performance.",Polymer

Here, we establish that COFs could have implications as microadditives of binders (≈1 wt % in cathode), and a series of anthraquinone-COF based hollow tubes have been prepared as model microadditives. The microadditives can strengthen the basic properties of the binder and spontaneously immobilize and catalytically convert lithium polysulfides, as proved by density functional calculations, thus showing almost doubly enhanced reversible capacity compared with that of the bare electrode.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition

We review the preparation methods of functionalized carbon-based host materials and analyze the structure-function relationship of carbon-based composite materials and sulfur cathodes. We discuss the influence of the change of morphology, structure, and composition on the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathode. Finally, the feasibility of the functionalized carbon-based composite materials are prospected in the practical application of the lithium-sulfur battery.",Acta Chimica Sinica
Hierarchical mesoporous MoS2 frameworks with conformal carbon coating as a high-rate and stable anode in Li-ion battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Hierarchical or mesoporous-structured molybdenum disulfides (MoS2) are one of the promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their abundant active sites, fast ion transport, and easy permeation of electrolyte. However, the synthesis of such architectures with precise structural control is challenging, often requiring preliminary fabrication of templates or special equipment. Herein, we report hierarchical and mesoporous MoS2 frameworks (HM-MoS2) synthesized via a facile phase-segregation route, where ZnS nanoparticles are in situ formed as the hard template. The mesopores and interconnected channels created by removing ZnS nanoparticles enable the uniform carbon coating on HM-MoS2. When employed as an anode in LIB, the HM-MoS2 of an optimal carbon coating exhibits a high rate capability of 396.8 mA.h g−1 at 10 A g−1 and a prolonged cyclability with only 2.8 % of capacity decay.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry

Highly conductive and catalytically active sulfur host is still a research hotspot in recent years. Herein, the sulfur host of Co nanoparticles anchored on the Co-Nx active centers grafted nitrogen-doped graphene (Co/Co-Nx@NG) with high catalytic activity and electrical conductivity was prepared via a simple and feasible in situ method. The cobalt-based nanocatalytic center exhibits efficient sulfur conversion efficiency.

Constructing hierarchical structure based on LDH anchored boron-doped g-C3N4 assembled with MnO2 nanosheets towards reducing toxicants generation and fire hazard of epoxy resin,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdHigh fire hazard of releasing considerable toxicants and heat is regarded as a notorious issue for hindering the further application of epoxy resin (EP). Hence, a hierarchical structure (MLBCN) based on LDH anchored boron-doped g-C3N4 assembled with MnO2 nanosheets is rationally constructed as flame retardant additive for EP. Concretely, the incorporation of 1.0 wt% MLBCN leads to the decreases of 31.9% and 25.3% in peak heat release rate and total heat release, separately, reflecting the impeded heat release. Meanwhile, the peak smoke production rate and total smoke release are reduced by 37.1% and 33.4%, respectively, corroborating the hindered fire toxicity. The clear evidence for inhibited emissions of toxic CO and NO gases can be acquired from TG-IR spectra. These results collectively confirm the efficacy of MLBCN in reducing the toxicants generation and fire hazard of EP, deriving from its physical barrier, chemical catalyzing and charring promotion actions. Besides, the tensile and flexural strength are improved by 43.9% and 10.6%, by adding 1.0 wt% MLBCN, demonstrating the promoted mechanical performance. Overall, using MLBCN achieves the simultaneous enhancements in fire safety and mechanical capability of polymer.

Supports promote single-atom catalysts toward advanced electrocatalysis,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) offer high reactivity and selectivity toward catalytic reaction while maximizing the utilization of active components. Unfortunately, single-atom sites are susceptible to sintering and agglomerating into thermodynamically stable nanoclusters due to their high surface energy. Introducing appropriate supports to optimize the local coordination environment and electronic properties, as well as induce strong metal-support interactions (SMSI), is essential to preventing sintering. Although a range of potential SACs with low-cost supports are emerging as promising candidates for heterogeneous catalysis, the real roles and key factors of supports that govern the catalytic properties of these SACs remain ambiguous. Aiming at understanding the bonding between atomic sites and supports and how this relates to the catalytic performance, we herein summarize the recent experimental and computational efforts of SACs toward electrocatalysis. Moreover, the real role of the support in the SACs plays in affecting the electrocatalytic reaction is also emphasized. Furthermore, before ending this review, we have also proposed the prospects and challenges of the advanced SACs for the application in the field of electrocatalytic energy conversion.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Hydroxylation mechanism of phase regulation of nanocrystal BaTiO3 synthesized by a hydrothermal method,"© 2021Understanding the phase regulation mechanism of BaTiO3 synthesized by a hydrothermal method is a complicated and challenging task. Here, we successfully prepared cubic and tetragonal BaTiO3 single nanocrystals by changing the ratio of water and ethanol in the solvent. We confirm that the BaTiO3 phase is mainly affected by the hydroxylation process due to the reaction with solvent. In particular, ethanol can be catalytically oxidized by titanium atoms, cause BaTiO3 hydroxylation and promote the formation of a cubic phase. In the mixed solution of ethanol and water, the hydroxylation process is suppressed, which facilitates the formation of the tetragonal phase. The relationship framework between the solvent ratio, phase structure and hydroxyl defects of BaTiO3 is established. Tetragonal BaTiO3 with fewer hydroxyl defects can promote charge transfer and surface reaction after polarization, thereby enhancing their photoelectric catalytic performance. This work provides references for the controllable synthesis of ferroelectric nanocrystals by hydrothermal methods and new insight for the utilization of polarization in photoelectrocatalysis applications.",Ceramics International

In this work, we have explored the anchoring behaviors of S8 and Li2Sn (n = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8) clusters on PtTe monolayer by employing the density functional theory (DFT). Our results indicate that the binding strength of PtTe monolayer to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) clusters are moderate with adsorption energies from 1.04 eV to 3.44 eV. The strong interaction of LiPSs and PtTe substrate was revealed by the significant charge transfers and orbital hybridizations. The metallic feature of PtTe monolayer is well-preserved upon the adsorption of LiPSs, thereby guaranteeing its high electric conductivity.

Fluorine-doped graphene oxide prepared by direct plasma treatment for supercapacitor application,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Charge storage in supercapacitors is strongly related to the bond characteristics and electronic structure of electrode materials. Graphene-based materials are widely used in a supercapacitor due to the easily tunable properties and high surface/volume ratios. However, we claim that the typical covalent bond characteristics of 2D carbon materials originating from this 2pπ orbital is not very suitable to the application in supercapacitor. Here, we suggest an efficient way to improve the supercapacitor performance by tuning the covalency of bonding between the graphene-based electrode and potassium ion. We, for the first time, also introduce a simple solvent-free scale-up doping technique to prepare fluorine-doped graphene oxide (FGO) by direct plasma treatment on graphene oxide (GO) powder at ambient pressure. The FGO enabled fast electrochemical charge transfer and provided a large number of active sites for redox reactions during supercapacitor operation, and those mechanisms were thoroughly studied by various electrochemical analyses. As a result, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor using FGO electrodes exhibited a maximum power density (~3200 W/kg) and energy density (~25.87 Wh/kg) with superior cycle stability (20000 cycles) without capacitance loss. Furthermore, the computational calculation results clarified the roles of semi-ionic C–F bonding of FGO: huge charge accumulation on the electrodes and superior electrical conductivity. Thus, our study demonstrates a facile strategy to develop promising functionalized materials, which can enhance the viability of supercapacitor for the next generation of energy storage systems.",Chemical Engineering Journal

The KCl as a prop enhances the interlayer distance and the structural stability. And the N vacancy and the pyridinic-N increase the conductivity, the active sites and the reversibility of Li+ storage. Thus, the optimized electrode shows a higher specific discharge capacity (389 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1) and a longer cyclic life (66% capacity retention after 10 K cycles at 3.0 A g−1) compared to those of bulk g-C3N4.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Besides, the flame-retardant performance of TPU/PCS-MXene nanocomposite was greatly enhanced, while the smoke emission was effectively suppressed. As only 3 wt% PCS-MXene was introduced, peak heat release rate, total heat release, and total smoke production of the composite decreased by 66.7%, 21.0%, and 27.7%, respectively, compared to the pristine TPU. Systematical characterization was then carried out to investigate the enhancement mechanism of PCS-MXene, highlighting the crucial role of PCS combined with the catalytic effect of MXene. In brief, the compatibility issues of MXene were effectively addressed, and its flame-retardancy enhanced greatly via the PCS modification, the bio-based characteristic of which, in turn greatly benefits the further development of MXene-polymer composite.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Imidazolium ionic Liquid-Regulated Sub-5-nm Pt(1 1 1) with a stable configuration anchored on hollow carbon nanoshells for efficient oxygen reduction,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Here, N-doped hollow carbon sphere (NHCS)-supported (1 1 1)-plane-engineered sub-5-nm Pt (Pt-NHCS) catalysts regulated precisely by imidazolium ionic liquids were synthesized successfully and used to catalyze oxygen reduction. The (1 1 1)-plane engineered Pt nanocrystals with a diameter of 4.5 ± 0.5 nm were homogeneously deposited on the 3-dimensional spherical nanoshells. The resulting Pt nanocrystals anchored on the carbon skeleton exhibit a stable configuration in both alkaline and acid electrolytes with the help of imidazolium cations and pyrolysis. Among all as-prepared catalysts, the optimized Pt-NHCS shows remarkable long-term durability. Specifically, Pt-NHCS maintains 95.3% of the original current density after 10,000 potential cycles, while Pt/C benchmarks exhibit a retention of 78.5%. Accelerated durability test results indicate that Pt-NHCS exhibits a high efficiency of 96 % in comparison with initial current density, while a value of 86% for Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that reactive Pt(1 1 1) planes with well-defined Schottky defects and vacancies adsorb and activate oxygen molecule rapidly while desorbing the reaction intermediates.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Carbon dots confined in N-doped carbon as peroxidase-like nanozyme for detection of gastric cancer relevant D-amino acids,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The concentrations of D-Proline (D-Pro) and D-Alanine (D-Ala) in the saliva of early-stage gastric cancer patients are prominently higher than those of healthy people. Therefore, precisely monitoring the concentrations of D-Pro and D-Ala has essential implications for gastric cancer diagnosis and treatment. Here, through pyrolysis of ZIF-8 precursor filled with glucose (G@ZIF-8), the carbon dots confined in N-doped carbon (CDs@NC) are successfully obtained. The CDs@NC can readily act as peroxidase-like nanozyme for the colorimetric detection of D-amino acids that associated with early gastric cancer. Intriguingly, the peroxidase-like activity of CDs@NC can be tuned easily by adjusting the content of glucose precursors. Further study of the catalytic mechanism shows that the superoxide radical (O2[rad]−) may be the critical Reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the peroxidase-like catalytic reactions. The excellent results of saliva tests suggest that the colorimetric method could be used to quickly distinguish patients with early gastric cancer from healthy people.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Dual-regulation strategy to enhance electrochemical catalysis ability of NiCo2O4-x for polysulfides conversion in Li-S batteries,"© 2021Recently, lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been considered as the most potential energy storage system, but the application of LSBs is still confronted with significant challenges. One among the significant challenges is the low kinetics. In this work, we design the urchin-like structure of NiCo2O4 to expose more catalytic sites to accelerate the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion. And the oxygen deficient in NiCo2O4 with spinel type structure (space group Fd3m) leads to the excellent chemical affinity of NiCo2O4-x for LiPSs. Moreover, because of the optimal distribution of electron on (3 1 1) plane of NiCo2O4-x, the Gibbs free energies of the evolution from S8 to Li2S on (3 1 1) plane of NiCo2O4-x is much lower than that of NiCo2O4, illustrating the NiCo2O4-x with the higher catalytic activity. Therefore, the cell with the NiCo2O4-x modified separator exhibits a superior rate performance (632 mAh g−1 at 2.5 C) and a long cycle life (404 mAh g−1 at 1 C after 800 cycles) with excellent Li+ ion diffusion coefficient. The rational structural optimization makes NiCo2O4-x become the efficient catalyst of LSBs. And the results promote the development of bimetallic oxides as catalyst in LSBs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"One-pot synthesis of Mn2P-Mn2O3 heterogeneous nanoparticles in a P, N -doped three-dimensional porous carbon framework as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Robust, inexpensive, efficient catalysts for overall water splitting are of significant interest as we look towards the Hydrogen Economy. Herein, we have prepared novel Mn2P-Mn2O3 heterogeneous nanoparticles hosted in a P, N-doped three-dimensional porous carbon framework. Of these, Mn2P-Mn2O3/PNCF displayed ultrahigh stability as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in alkaline electrolytes. These properties are a result of the abundant heterogeneous interfaces, optimized electronic configurations and hierarchical pore structure of the Mn2P-Mn2O3/PNCF catalyst. This material has a closed zero calculated Gibbs free energy for adsorbed H of −0.013 eV, and can achieve current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 for HERs and OERs, respectively, whilst requiring only low overpotentials of 98 mV and 330 mV, respectively. In addition, an alkaline electrolyzer with Mn2P-Mn2O3/PNCF as both the anode and cathode demonstrates a nearly comparable activity and higher stability than the present state‐of‐the‐art, Pt/C || RuO2/C, for full water splitting. Mn2P-Mn2O3/PNCF shows great potential for the economical, large-scale production of H2.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Highly rechargeable lithium oxygen batteries cathode based on boron and nitrogen co-doped holey graphene,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Heteroatoms doped carbon based materials with enhanced catalytic properties hold great potential in energy storage applications, including rechargeable lithium oxygen batteries (LOBs). However, large-scale production of heteroatoms co-doped carbon with high-level dopants as well as the precise control of uniformly distributed dopant location remain challenges. Holey graphene as an emerging carbon based material has attracted increased attention as cathode for LOBs due to its nanoholes through the graphene nanosheet basal plane. Apart from the given rapid diffusion channels for mass (e.g., O2 and Li+ ), the nanoholes also provide rich egdes for the mass adsorption and storage as well as the heteroatoms doping. Herein, we report an environment-friendly and simple approach to mass production of hG with abundant in-plane nanoholes via direct oxidation of reduced graphene oxides (rG) by a controlled flow gas of H2O. Based on the obtained hG, 3.0 at.% B and 2.1 at.% N atoms are further co-doped into the hG to form B, N-hG. Benefiting from its holey structures and the synergistic effect of B and N, the B, N-hG as cathode for LOBs displays promising properties with a maximum discharge capacity of 15340 mAh g−1 and long cycling stability over 117 cycles.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Three-dimensionally Ordered Macro-porous Metal-organic Framework for High-performance Lithium-sulfur Battery,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe commercial application of lithium-sulfur (Li−S) battery is greatly hampered by the shuttling of lithium polysulfide (LiPS). In this work, a double-solution-induced method is proposed to synthesize multifunctional three-dimensionally ordered macro-micro porous MOFs (3DOM ZIF67) as an efficient promotor to achieve excellent electrochemical performance. The unique ordered macro-porous structure not only accelerates ion diffusion and charge transfer, but also enlarges the active interfaces. In addition, the nanometric ZIF67 unit with high porosity can achieve strong sulfur immobilization and catalysis by chemical interaction with LiPS, which vastly inhibited shuttle effect and promoted the rapid redox kinetics. As expected, the S/3DOM ZIF67 cathode achieves a high capacity of 920.7 mAh g−1 at 1.0 C and excellent cycle performance over 500 cycles. This design offers a feasible way to develop MOF-based materials with efficient adsorption and electrocatalysis for high-performance Li−S battery.",ChemElectroChem
A Simple Approach towards Highly Dense Graphene Films for High Volumetric Performance Supercapacitors,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHAn interface self-assembly followed by hydrothermal reduction method are proposed to obtain a tannic acid (TA)-modified reduced graphene oxide composite film (|TA/RGO|). This unique method endows |TA/RGO| with several advantages: (1) TA is adopted as a redox-active spacer between adjacent interlayers for enlarging the ion-accessible area and contributing to pseudocapacitance; (2) due to the intensive pressure exerted by the sandwich-like device during the hydrothermal reduction process, appropriate expansion and a relatively flat layered structure are achieved which will facilitate the ion transport. As a result, the |TA/RGO| film shows an ultrahigh volumetric performance of 701 F cm−3 with a high density of 1.91 g cm−3 using a three-electrode system. When assembled into a symmetric supercapacitor, |TA/RGO| film delivers a high volumetric capacitance of 244.8 F cm−3 and a high capacitance retention of 100 % after 5000 cycles at the current density of 2 A g−1, showing a great potential for large-scale application.",ChemElectroChem
Theoretical design of SnS2–graphene heterojunctions with vacancy and impurity defects for multi-purpose photoelectric devices,"This journal is © the Owner SocietiesSnS2 with atomic thickness has attracted extensive attention in the field of photocatalysis due to its special physicochemical properties, suitable band gap, low cost and low environmental toxicity. However, the application of SnS2 in the field of optoelectronics is restricted by its low photocatalytic efficiency and carrier mobility. In this study, vacancies and transition metal atoms are introduced into a SnS2 monolayer to modulate its physicochemical properties. Meanwhile, the SnS2 monolayer modified by vacancies and transition metal atoms is combined with graphene to form a heterostructure, which promotes the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The results of theoretical calculations show that the SnS2/graphene heterojunction can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers in intrinsic monolayer SnS2, and improve the photocatalytic efficiency and carrier mobility. The modification of Sn vacancies and Fe, Co atoms not only expands the visible light response range of the SnS2/graphene heterojunction, but also introduces magnetism, which is expected to be applied in spin optoelectronic materials. In this work, defects, doping and heterojunction assembly are rationally integrated, which provides a new idea for the design and development of spin optoelectronic devices based on monolayer SnS2",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Nitrogen-doped porous carbon fiber/vertical graphene as an efficient polysulfide conversion catalyst for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Under high sulfur loading, high sulfur content and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S), the practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are seriously limited by the negative and slow kinetics of polysulfide. Here, a freestanding sulfur cathode based on nitrogen-doped porous carbon fiber/vertical graphene (NF@VG) composites is proposed. The porous structure and nitrogen doping effectively enhance absorption of polysulfides through physical confinement and chemical action, while vertical graphene network greatly promotes electron transfer and boosts the catalytic conversion kinetics of polysulfides. Therefore, the as-prepared sulfur cathode exhibits an initial capacity of 738 mA h g-1, and a maintained capacity of 609 mA h g-1 after 600 cycles with only 0.029% capacity fading per cycle at 1C rate at a sulfur loading of 7 mg cm-2. In addition, the battery displays an areal capacity of 12.8 mA h cm-2 under high sulfur loading (13 mg cm-2), high sulfur content (81.6 wt%), and low E/S (4.8 μL mg-1), indicating that NF@VG composite fibers are highly competitive as a sulfur host for Li-S batteries.

Dynamic structural transformation induced by defects in nano-rod FeOOH during electrochemical water splitting,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Defect engineering is a prevailing strategy for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction activity for water spitting of electrocatalysts with a single phase or single metal; however, the exact role of defects in the improvement of catalytic activity remains unclear. Although Fe-based catalysts, such as unary FeOOH compounds, suffer from insufficient activity, they are promising catalysts due to their low cost, rich redox properties and low toxicity. In this work, a unique defect-rich nanorod FeOOH catalyst (D-FeOOH) is rationally constructed by simple electron beam irradiation, which enhances the mass activity by 8 times compared with that for pristine FeOOH and achieves the highest rank among unary Fe catalysts reported to date. In situ Raman and hard X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies reveal that defects during the OER activation process can speed up the dynamic reconstruction from single β-FeOOH to a mixed α/β-FeOOH phase and modulate the ultimate atomic ratio of the mixed phase, which enhances the electrochemical performance. This work provides insight into the defect mechanism in FeOOH by accelerating the dynamic structural evolution during the OER process.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Exceptional lithium diffusion through porous aromatic framework (PAF) interlayers delivers high capacity and long-life lithium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries offer potential for significant energy density storage gains in concert with the use of sustainable electrode materials. Their cycling stability and slow charging kinetics need significant improvement for deployment in practical settings. Consequently, facilitated transport within the cell is critical for promoting lithium transport whilst simultaneously retarding the movement of polysulfides, which limit the capacity and stability. We have developed a nanoporous interlayer with an ideal pore architecture and surface chemistry that overcomes these challenges. Porous Aromatic Frameworks (PAFs) have uniform 13 Å pores and exceptional internal surface areas that can be readily chemically functionalized. Appropriate sulfonation levels (SPAF) within these pores can deliver exceptional lithium ion transport rates, concomitant with the repulsion of unwanted polysulfide moieties. This combination of properties leads to outstanding capacity retention, above 1000 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at practical charge rates. Our high capacity and cyclable battery design is also supported by high coulombic efficiency (av. >99.5%) and sulfur utilization (∼96%) as well as excellent lithium anode protection. These remarkable properties have been methodically explored with a suite of analytical techniques that link the battery performance to the fundamental physicochemical properties of the SPAF hybrid interlayer.

Recent progress in quantum dots based nanocomposite electrodes for rechargeable monovalent metal-ion and lithium metal batteries,"This journal is © The Royal Society of ChemistryEngineering electrode architecture with an abundant active surface for charge storage, shorter ion diffusion path, low charge transfer resistance, and structural integrity against volume change during cycling are the key requirements while designing electrodes in rechargeable batteries. Compared to the traditional micro or nano size of active materials, quantum dots (QDs) with ultrafine particle size (<10 nm) offer a large number of active edges as well as large accessible surface area, shorter ion diffusion path, excellent dispersibility, and homogeneous volume expansion/contraction to buffer lattice distortion during cycling. Apart from acting as active materials, they can also act as electrocatalysts to accelerate certain kinetically sluggish redox reactions or regulate metal deposition at the anode during charging. However, due to the high surface charge, QDs tend to aggregate, and often require a suitable support and rational designing to prevent this aggregation and to retain the unique properties of QDs as electrode materials in the solid state. In addition, such hetero-structures can also modify the physicochemical behavior and electrochemical performance of a composite material. Herein we represent a timely review on the recent advancement in QD based carbonaceous and noncarbonaceous nanocomposite electrodes for rechargeable monovalent metal-ion (Li, Na, and K-ion), and lithium–metal (Li–S and Li–air) batteries. Different strategies adopted towards fabricating high-performance electrodes with QDs, such as (i) decorating conducting carbon (graphene) QDs on nano/micron-sized active materials, (ii) engineering active material QDs on conducting carbon supports, and (iii) creating active materials QD/active material heterostructures with or without an additional conducting phase, etc. along with their electrochemical performances have been summarized.

From Theory to Experiment: Cascading of Thermocatalysis and Electrolysis in Oxygen Evolution Reactions,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyThe role of elevated temperatures in electrolysis has generally been regarded as accelerations of electron transport, mass transport, and adsorption/desorption processes. In the present work, with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that thermally activated on-surface reactions can significantly increase the efficiency of energy conversions in electrolysis via a thermally and electrically cascaded mechanism. In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), to be specific, the formation of high-energy *OOH on Fe can be assisted by thermally activated combination of *O and *OH on the surface of iron-benzenehexathiol coordination polymer (Fe-BHT). Such theoretical predictions are then confirmed by our experimental measurements. The OER efficiency on Fe-BHT increases with increasing temperature and outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst at around 80 °C. This research may shed light on an avenue for designing and preparing electrocatalysts with enhanced catalytic performance.",ACS Energy Letters

Multilayer Load and Fast Diffusion of Metal Ions on a Ti2CS2/Blue Phosphorene Heterostructure Anode,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyDeveloping electrode materials with better storage performances is currently one of the hotspots in the field of battery storage. Though monolayer materials such as Ti2CS2 and blue phosphorene (BlueP) monolayers have some excellent storage properties as anode materials, the re-stacking of Ti2CS2 and poor conductivity of BlueP may limit their application prospects. Considering that the heterostructure may retain/avoid the advantages/disadvantages of monolayer anodes, we study the load and diffusion of Li/Na/K ions on a Ti2CS2/BlueP heterostructure to explore the feasibility of it as an anode via density functional theory. We find that this heterostructure not only retains the stability characteristics of Ti2CS2 and the high capacity of BlueP but also avoids the re-stacking of Ti2CS2 and poor conductivity of BlueP. Moreover, 4/8/3 layers (nine atoms per layer) of Li/Na/K are loaded into this heterostructure, far exceeding the 2/2/2 layers loaded into the pristine BlueP and 2/6/2.67 layers into the pristine Ti2CS2 due to the interfacial synergy. In addition, the Ti2CS2/BlueP anode material shows high capacity (344–917 mA h/g), low average open-circuit voltage (OCV) (0.32–0.78 V), and low diffusion barrier (0.10–0.37 eV). Furthermore, Ti2CS2/BlueP presents better prospects for Na-ion batteries among three batteries owing to the highest capacity and lowest average OCV.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
A Highly Active N-Doped Carbon Supported CoFe Alloy Catalyst for Hydroformylation of C8 Olefins,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyThe development of inexpensive and efficient Co-based heterogeneous catalysts for hydroformylation reactions remains an enormous challenge. In this paper, N-doped carbon supported CoFe bimetallic catalysts (CoFe/NC) are successfully synthesized through a simple thermal decomposition of a mixture of Co(acac)2 and Fe(acac)3, and melamine with activated carbon in N2 atmosphere. With the CoFe/NC-800 as the catalyst, hydroformylation of diisobutene proceeded smoothly in THF under 4 MPa syngas at 130 °C to obtain 92% conversion of diisobutene and 79.6% selectivity to isononyl aldehydes. Detailed studies revealed that the N-doped carbon supported FeCo alloy may be the active species in which nitrogen might act as ligand played an important role in improvement of catalytic performance of hydroformylation reactions. The present study provided meaningful insights into tuning the catalytic performance of non-noble metal heterogeneous catalysts for carbonylation reaction.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Toward Multicomponent Single-Atom Catalysis for Efficient Electrochemical Energy Conversion,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have recently emerged as the ultimate solution for overcoming the limitations of traditional catalysts by bridging the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Atomically dispersed identical active sites enable a maximal atom utilization efficiency, high activity, and selectivity toward the wide range of electrochemical reactions, superior structural robustness, and stability over nanoparticles due to strong atomic covalent bonding with supports. Mononuclear active sites of SACs can be further adjusted by engineering with multicomponent elements, such as introducing dual-metal active sites or additional neighbor atoms, and SACs can be regarded as multicomponent SACs if the surroundings of the active sites or the active sites themselves consist of multiple atomic elements. Multicomponent engineering offers an increased combinational diversity in SACs and unprecedented routes to exceed the theoretical catalytic performance limitations imposed by single-component scaling relationships for adsorption and transition state energies of reactions. The precisely designed structures of multicomponent SACs are expected to be responsible for the synergistic optimization of the overall electrocatalytic performance by beneficially modulating the electronic structure, the nature of orbital filling, the binding energy of reaction intermediates, the reaction pathways, and the local structural transformations. This Review demonstrates these synergistic effects of multicomponent SACs by highlighting representative breakthroughs on electrochemical conversion reactions, which might mitigate the global energy crisis of high dependency on fossil fuels. General synthesis methods and characterization techniques for SACs are also introduced. Then, the perspective on challenges and future directions in the research of SACs is briefly summarized. We believe that careful tailoring of multicomponent active sites is one of the most promising approaches to unleash the full potential of SACs and reach the superior catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability at the same time, which makes SACs promising candidates for electrocatalysts in various energy conversion reactions.",ACS Materials Au
Carbon-Nanotube-Encapsulated-Sulfur Cathodes for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: Integrated Computational Design and Experimental Validation,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.To mitigate lithium-polysulfides (Li-PSs) shuttle in lithium-sulfur batteries (LiSBs), a unique carbon-nanotube-encapsulated-sulfur (S@CNT) cathode material with optimum open-ring sizes (ORSs) on the CNT walls were designed using an integrated computational approach followed by experimental validation. By calculating the transport barrier of Li+ ion through ORSs on the CNT walls and comparing the molecular size of solvents and Li-PSs with ORSs, optimum open-rings with 16-30 surrounding carbon atoms were predicted to selectively allow transportation of Li+ ion and evaporated sulfur while blocking both Li-PS and solvent molecules. A CNT oxidation process was proposed and simulated to generate these ORSs, and the results indicated that the optimum ORSs can be achieved by narrowly controlling the oxidation parameters. Subsequently, S@CNT cathodes were experimentally synthesized, confirming that optimum ORSs were generated in CNT oxidized at 475 K and exhibited more stable cycling behavior.",Nano Letters
Rational Design of Main Group Metal-Embedded Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Materials as Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysts for CO2Hydrogenation to Formic Acid,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Developing efficient and inexpensive main group catalysts for CO2 conversion and utilization has attracted increasing attention, as the conversion process would be both economical and environmentally benign. Here, based on the main group element Al, we designed several heterogeneous frustrated Lewis acid/base pair (FLP) catalysts and performed extensive first-principles calculations for the hydrogenation of CO2. These catalysts, including Al@N-Gr-1, Al@N-Gr-2, and Al@C2N, are composed of a single Al atom and two-dimensional (2D) N-doped carbon-based materials to form frustrated Al/C or Al/N Lewis acid/base pairs, which are all predicted to have high reactivity to absorb and activate hydrogen (H2). Compared with Al@N-Gr-1, both Al@N-Gr-2 and Al@C2N, especially Al@N-Gr-2, containing Al/N Lewis pairs exhibit better catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with lower activation energies. CO2 hydrogenation on the three catalysts prefers to go through a three-step mechanism, i.e., the heterolytic dissociation of H2, followed by the transfer of the hydride near Al to CO2, and finally the activation of a second H2 molecule. Other IIIA group element (B and Ga)-embedded N-Gr-2 materials (B@N-Gr-2 and Ga@N-Gr-2) were also explored and compared. Both Al@N-Gr-2 and Ga@N-Gr-2 show higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation to HCOOH than B@N-Gr-2. However, the CO2 hydrogenation path on Ga@N-Gr-2 tends to follow a two-step mechanism, including H2 dissociation and subsequent hydrogen transfer. The present study provides a potential solution for CO2 hydrogenation by designing novel and effective FLP catalysts based on main group elements.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Two-Dimensional Polymers and Polymerizations,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Synthetic chemists have developed robust methods to synthesize discrete molecules, linear and branched polymers, and disordered cross-linked networks. However, two-dimensional polymers (2DPs) prepared from designed monomers have been long missing from these capabilities, both as objects of chemical synthesis and in nature. Recently, new polymerization strategies and characterization methods have enabled the unambiguous realization of covalently linked macromolecular sheets.

We discuss the fundamental understanding and scope of each of these approaches, including: the bond-forming reactions used, the synthetic diversity of 2DPs prepared, their multilayer stacking behaviors, nanoscale and mesoscale structures, and macroscale morphologies. Additionally, we describe the analytical tools currently available to characterize 2DPs in their various isolated forms. Finally, we review emergent 2DP properties and the potential applications of planar macromolecules.

Here, an atomically dispersed Mn-Nx on mesoporous N-doped amorphous carbon (MnNC) was engineered through pyrolyzing the Mn-Nx-containing complex generated by the reaction between Mn ions and phenanthroline. Owing to the atomically dispersed Mn-Nx moieties on the large mesoprous amorphous carbon, the resulting MnNC presents superb ORR performance evidenced by the half-wave potential of 0.86 V and the slight decay after long-time chronoamperometry tests, which surpasses commercial Pt/C and most reported Mn-based catalysts. Furthermore, the MnNC-based Zn-air battery delivers excellent performance, including a peak power density of 130.0 mW cm-2 and a specific capacity of 819.0 mAh gZn-1 as well as prominent durability that could continuously discharge for 60 h. This facile and scalable preparation approach provides a novel single-atom design direction for the architecture of high-performance ORR catalysts.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
Heteroatom Bridging Strategy in Carbon-Based Catalysts for Enhanced Oxidative Desulfurization Performance,"© Carbon-based catalysts are found to be promising metal-free species for aerobic oxidative desulfurization of fuel oil. Thus, a proper approach to promote their catalytic performances is very much in demand. In this contribution, a heteroatom bridging strategy is proposed to enhance the catalytic activities of carbon-based catalysts. As proof of the strategy, a series of boron (B)-doped graphite catalysts were synthesized. Detailed characterizations showed that the hetero-B atoms were uniformly dispersed in graphite. More importantly, it was found that the doped B atoms functioned as a bridge for electron transfer. With the existence of the heteroatom bridge, the activation of oxygen by graphite during the catalytic oxidation process was enhanced remarkably, leading to an ultradeep oxidative desulfurization performance. Moreover, the catalyst can be readily recycled five times without a significant decrease in desulfurization performance.",Inorganic Chemistry
Multisize CoS2 Particles Intercalated/Coated-Montmorillonite as Efficient Sulfur Host for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe chemisorption and catalysis of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are effective strategies to suppress the shuttle effect in lithium-sulfur (Li−S) batteries. Herein, multisize CoS2 particles intercalated/coated-montmorillonite (MMT) as an efficient sulfur host is synthesized. As expected, the obtained S/CoS2@MMT cathode achieves an absorption-catalysis synergistic effect through the polar MMT aluminosilicate sheets and the well-dispersed nano-micron CoS2 particles. Furthermore, efficient interlamellar ion pathways and interconnected conductive network are constructed within the composite host due to the intercalation/coating of CoS2 in/on MMT. Therefore, the S/CoS2@MMT cathode achieves an outstanding rate performance up to 5C (∼548 mAh g−1) and a high cycling stability with low capacity decay of 0.063 and 0.067 % per cycle for 500 cycles at 1C and 2C, respectively. With a higher sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm−2, the cathode still delivers satisfactory rate and cycling performance. It shows that the CoS2@MMT host has great application prospects in Li−S batteries.",ChemSusChem
Recent progress in Co–based metal–organic framework derivatives for advanced batteries,"© 2021To date, Co–based metal–organic frameworks (Co–MOFs) have drawn much attention owing to their advantages of easy preparation, high porosity and adjustable structure. Because of these enticing properties, numerous efforts have been devoted to their applications in energy storage and conversion. However, poor conductivity has become one of the biggest obstacles for large–scale use of pristine Co–MOFs. Subsequently, many attempts have been carried out to develop various Co–MOF derived materials as electrodes for rechargeable batteries in order to address the above–mentioned shortcoming and to enhance the electrical conductivity with improved stability during cycling. Moreover, in addition to improvement of Li–ion batteries in practical utilization, seeking for other rechargeable batteries is another urgent task due to the high cost and limited sources of metallic Li. Herein, by following the recent research progress, this review provides an overview of applications of Co–MOF derived materials in various rechargeable batteries including lithium–ion batteries, sodium–ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries, zinc air batteries and other rechargeable batteries, where they have been utilized as cathodes, anodes, separators and electrocatalysts. Accordingly, we categorize and compare the morphology driven electrochemical performance of various Co–MOF derivatives including porous carbon, cobalt oxides, cobalt chalcogenides, cobalt phosphides and corresponding composites.

Metallic C5N monolayer as an efficient catalyst for accelerating redox kinetics of sulfur in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© the Owner Societies 2021.Lithium-sulfur battery is one of the most promising applicants for the next generation of energy storage devices whose commercial applications are impeded by the key issue of the shuttle effect. To overcome this obstacle, various two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based metal-free compounds have been proposed to serve as anchoring materials for immobilizing soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPs), which however suffer from low electronic conductivity implying unsatisfactory performance for catalyzing sulfur redox. Therefore, we have predicted metallic C5N monolayers, possessing hexagonal (H) and orthorhombic (O) phases, exhibiting excellent performance for suppressing the shuttle effect. First-principles simulations demonstrate that O-C5N could serve as a bifunctional anchoring material due to its strong adsorption capability to LiPs and excellent catalytic performance for sulfur redox with active sites from both basal plane and zigzag edges. Furthermore, the rate of Li2S oxidation over O-C5N is fast due to the low energy barrier of 0.93 eV for Li2S decomposition. While for H-C5N, only N atoms located at the armchair edges can efficiently trap LiPs and boost the formation and dissociation of Li2S during discharge and charge processes, respectively. The current work opens an avenue of designing 2D metallic carbon-based anchoring materials for lithium-sulfur batteries, which deserves further experimental research efforts.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Formamide-soluble solid-state ZnO as Zn source for synthesizing FeCo-NC with ultrahigh oxygen reduction reaction activity,"© the Partner Organisations.The high-cost synthesis of highly dispersed non-noble metal-nitrogen-carbon (MNC) electrocatalysts hinders their practical applications. Here, we have developed a cost/time-efficient synthesis method for MNC electrocatalysts with highly dispersed metal sites, using the commercially available cheap ZnO as the Zn source, reducing the cost of Zn usage by over 80%. Our specially chosen solvent formamide can react with ZnO and allow the formation of nano-sized ZnFeCo-Nx complexes uniformly distributed in the formamide-derived high-N-doped carbon substrate. Further annealing the ZnFeCo-N-C precursor will produce a highly dispersed FeCo-NC target product. Electrochemical measurements show that the prepared FeCo-NC is an excellent electrocatalyst for alkaline oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), rendering superior onset and half-wave potentials of 1.05 and 0.92 V, respectively. The Al-air battery assembled using this also shows a high specific power (204.9 mW cm-2) and a large specific capacity (552 mA h g-1 at 10 mA cm-2), exceeding those of the 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. Our method may inspire the scalable and low-cost production of highly dispersed MNC electrocatalysts and their wide range of practical applications. This journal is",Materials Chemistry Frontiers

"Porphyrin framework-derived N-doped porous carbon-confined Ru for NH3BH3methanolysis: The more pyridinic-N, the better","© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Encapsulating metal nanoparticles (MNPs) inside specific porous materials is considered as a feasible strategy to prepare ultrafine MNPs with high stability. Herein, ultrafine Ru nanoparticles (NPs) with a mean size of 3.2 nm encapsulated in an N-doped porous carbon (NC) derived from the pyrolysis of a new porphyrin framework (POF) were fabricatedviaa simple wet chemical method, in which the POF was synthesized using 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde and pyrrole as raw materials. The tomographic characterization of reconstructed slices confirmed the successful encapsulation of Ru NPs in POF-NC600 (pyrolysis temperatureT= 600 °C). Due to the confinement effects and anchoring effects of POF-NC600, Ru@POF-NC600 shows the smallest particle size of Ru NPs and the highest hydrogen production performance toward the methanolysis of ammonia borane (AB) among the investigated catalysts, providing a record initial turnover frequency (TOF) value of 727 min−1at 25 °C as compared to those heterogeneous catalysts ever reported. Systematic investigations reveal that pyridinic-N plays a pivotal role in the particle size distribution of Ru NPs and catalytic activity of the catalyst. Extended studies confirm that pyridinic-N, as an efficient anchoring site, determines the dispersity and size distribution of Ru NPs, thus affecting the catalytic activity of the catalyst. The more pyridinic-N, the better the catalytic activity. A series of isotopic experiments were performed, and it is found for the first time that the cleavage of the O-H bond in methanol is involved in the rate-determining step (RDS) of AB methanolysis. This work offers insights into rationally designing stable and ultrafine metal NPs confined in pyridinic-N-rich composites for various applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
"Co,N-co-doped graphene sheet as a sulfur host for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries","© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.To improve the performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, herein, based on the idea of designing a material that can adsorb polysulfides and improve the reaction kinetics, a Co,N-co-doped graphene composite (Co-N-G) was prepared. According to the characterization of Co-N-G, there was a homogeneous and dispersed distribution of N and Co active sites embedded in the Co-N-G sample. The 2D sheet-like microstructure and Co, N with a strong binding energy provided significant physical and chemical adsorption functions, which are conducive to the bonding S and suppression of LiPSs. Moreover, the dispersed Co and N as catalysts promoted the reaction kinetics in Li-S batteries via the reutilization of LiPSs and reduced the electrochemical resistance. Thus, the discharge specific capacity in the first cycle for the Co-N-G/S battery reached 1255.7 mA h g-1 at 0.2C. After 100 cycles, it could still reach 803.0 mA h g-1, with a retention rate of about 64%. This phenomenon proves that this type of Co-N-G composite with Co and N catalysts plays an effective role in improving the performance of batteries and can be further studied in Li-S batteries.",RSC Advances

Iron Porphyrin Organic Frameworks Derived Bionic-Tree-Nodule-like Fe7S8with Ultralong Potassium Ion Storage,"© Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) serve as anodes for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) because of their high conductivity, high capacity, and requirement of cheap raw materials. However, their volume expansion, agglomeration, and crushing often lead to limited cycle life and inferior structural stability. Here, inspired by biological tree nodules, S, N-codoped carbon-coated Fe7S8 particles (Fe7S8@SNC) originated from metalloporphyrins and were rationally designed for PIBs after being vulcanized by a one-pot method. Fe7S8@SNC as an anode delivered a high reversible capacity of 410 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, an extremely long cycle up to 2000 cycles with a capacity of 214 mAh g-1 maintained at 1000 mA g-1, and excellent rate performances (287 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1 and 181 mAh g-1 at 2000 mA g-1). Significantly, ex situ TEM can still capture the stable structure of Fe7S8 after 500 cycles. In this unique structure, prominent Fe7S8 particles reduce the mechanical stress and shorten the transport path of K+, alleviating the pulverization during repeated insertion/extraction of K+. The S, N-codoped carbon decoration protects the structural stability and inhibits the agglomeration of internal Fe7S8, alleviates the volume change caused by the K+ reaction, and greatly improves the stability of PIBs. This study provides a new strategy for the realization of TMSs with ultralong cycling stability and lays a foundation for the commercial application of PIBs.",Energy and Fuels

An Exfoliation–Evaporation Strategy To Regulate N Coordination Number of Co Single-Atom Catalysts for High-Performance Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietySingle-atom catalysts (SACs) with metal–nitrogen (M–N) moiety are effective in boosting the redox kinetics of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. However, the precise preparation of SACs with controllable M–N coordination number remains challenging and the relationship between M–N coordination number and polysulfide redox kinetics is still unexplored. Herein, a novel exfoliation-evaporation strategy assisted by molten salt is proposed to fabricate Co SACs (named Co–Nx) with different N coordination numbers for Li–S batteries. The key of this strategy is to exfoliate layered Co-based ZIF-L precursors into N-doped graphene with abundant dispersed Co atoms by molten salt and then control Co–N coordination number by selectively introducing Zn evaporation to promote C–N fragments release. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that highly unsaturated Co–N2 with asymmetric electron distribution immobilizes LiPSs, accelerates LiPSs conversion, and promotes Li2S deposition/dissociation more effectively than Co–N4 through stronger chemical interactions. As a result, Co–N2 endows Li–S batteries with long cycle life (0.05% capacity decay per cycle for 700 cycles), excellent rate capability (687 mAh g–1 at 5 C), and high areal capacity of 8.2 mAh cm–2 at a high loading of 7.0 mg cm–2. This work provides an effective strategy to fabricate SACs with controllable N coordination number and establishes the relationship between M–N coordination number and LiPSs redox kinetics, motivating future rational design of SACs for high-performance Li–S batteries.",ACS Materials Letters

Conductive V2C MXene and paralelectric SrTiO3 containing polymer composites with high dielectric constant,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Strontium titanate (STO) is a ferroelectric ceramic that shows paraelectric behaviour at room temperature, leading to a low dielectric constant in polymer composites with STO particles for energy storage applications. In this study, to improve the dielectric constant of polymer/STO composites, STO filler was modified via its hybridisation with conductive V2C MXene to form high-polarity interphase. The high-polarity mechanism of the V2C/STO interphase was analysed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. An interesting connection between V2C and STO through an interfacial single oxygen atom was observed. Polymer composites containing hybrid filler exhibited balanced electrical properties, including a high dielectric constant, low tanδ, and high breakdown strength. The novelty of this study lies in the strategy of improving the dielectric response of a paraelectric ceramic filler through heterojunction modification. Consequently, the composite with 9 wt% hybrid filler exhibited a high dielectric constant of ~87 and low tanδ of ~0.038 at 100 Hz along with a reasonably high breakdown strength of ~233 MV/m. It is expected that this study will contribute to the effective design of high-polarity hybrid ceramic fillers for advanced composite dielectric applications.",Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects
Mesoporous N-rich Carbon with Single-Ni Atoms as a Multifunctional Sulfur Host for Li-S Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Physicochemical confinement and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are crucial to suppress the shuttle effect and enhance the redox kinetics of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries.

Electrocatalytic enhancement mechanism of cobalt single atoms anchored on different MXene substrates in oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions,"© 2022 The Authors. EcoMat published by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Decorating single atoms of transition metals on MXenes to enhance the electrocatalytic properties of the resulting composites is a useful strategy for developing efficient electrocatalysts, and the mechanisms behind this enhancement are under intense scrutiny. Herein, we anchored Co single atoms onto several commonly used MXene substrates (V2CTx, Nb2CTx and Ti3C2Tx) and systematically studied the electrocatalytic behavior and the mechanisms of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively) of the resulting composites. Co@V2CTx composite displays an OER overpotential of 242 mV and an HER overpotential of 35 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, which is much lower than for Co@Nb2CTx and Co@Ti3C2Tx, making it comparable to the commercial noble metal Pt/C and RuO2/C electrocatalysts. The experimental and theoretical results point out that the enhanced bifunctional catalytic performance of Co@V2CTx benefits from the stronger hybridization between Co 3d and surface terminated O 2p orbitals which optimized the electronic structure of Co single atoms in the composite. This, in turn, results in lowering the OER and HER energy barriers and acceleration of the catalytic kinetics in case of the Co@V2CTx composite. The advantage of Co@V2CTx was further validated by its high overall water splitting performance (1.60 V to deliver 10 mA cm−2). Our study sheds light on the origins of the catalytic activity of single transition metals atoms on MXene substrates, and provides guidelines for designing efficient bifunctional MXene-based electrocatalysts.

Single atomic Fe-pyridine N catalyst with dense active sites improve bifunctional electrocatalyst activity for rechargeable and flexible Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The iron-pyridinic-N moiety is considered more active for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, low active site density and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity hinder the further improvement of Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, the macromolecules of the different nitrogen sites have been rationally designed and fabricated to create a carbon material with a high content of pyridine N. On this basis, the activated carbon matrix allows the halfway reduction of Fe3+ to Fex+, which is coordinated with pyridinic N to form a high-loading Fe-pyridinic N bonding structure. It also stimulates the complete reduction of Fe3+ to a single Fe atom on a 3D sponge carbon structure (named Fe/Fe-NC-3). Benefiting from pyridine N, the Fe-pyridinic N-bonding structure, single atom dispersion, and hierarchical pore channels, the Fe/Fe-NC-3 shows superior ORR and OER electrochemical activity, approaching that of the commercial Pt/C and IrO2. In addition, Fe/Fe-NC-3 as a ZAB air-electrode exhibits outstanding stability for over 500 h and a remarkable power density of 304.4 mW cm−2 in reversible ZABs. Moreover, the flexible ZABs deliver a high open-circuit voltage of 1.35 V, stable voltage gap under flat/bent states, and discharge voltage at 2 mA cm−2.

Metallic FeCo clusters propelling the stepwise polysulfide conversion in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Catalytic conversion of polysulfides is considered to be an important way to improve the kinetics and inhibit the shuttle effect of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSB). In this work, a 3D FeCo/PNC composite was prepared by in situ anchoring of the sulfiphilic compound FeCo on a lithiophilic N-doped porous carbon (PNC) substrate. Uniquely, the sulfiphilic FeCo clusters and lithiophilic N species active sites in the FeCo/PNC tend to form strong interactions of “Fe/Co-S, Li-O or Li-N” bonding, simultaneously enhancing the chemisorption and conversion ability toward polysulfides. More importantly, this strategy utilizes bi-metallic FeCo clusters to selectively catalyze the long-chain polysulfide conversion (S8 ↔ Li2S4) and short-chain polysulfide conversion reactions (Li2S4 ↔ Li2S), respectively. As a result, the prepared S@FeCo/PNC-based electrode with 70 wt% S-loading delivered a high mass capacity (1405 mA h g−1 at 0.1C) and an excellent cycling stability (99.55% retention rate after 500 cycles at 1C). Apparently, the combination of the stepwise catalysis of the bi-metallic clusters and the synergistic anchoring of the dual active sites (bi-metallic clusters and N) plays an important role in accelerating the polysulfide conversion and suppressing the “shuttle effect” in high-performance Li-S batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

Continuous amino-functionalized University of Oslo 66 membranes as efficacious polysulfide barriers for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022, Higher Education Press.The shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides is a serious problem impeding the development of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, continuous amino-functionalized University of Oslo 66 membranes supported on carbon nanotube films are proposed as ion-permselective interlayers that overcome these issues and show outstanding suppression of the polysulfide shuttle effect. The proposed membrane material has appropriately sized pores, and can act as ionic sieves and serve as barriers to polysulfides transport while allowing the passage of lithium ions during electrochemical cycles, thereby validly preventing the shuttling of polysulfides. Moreover, a fast catalytic conversion of polysulfides is also achieved with the as-developed interlayer. Therefore, lithium-sulfur batteries with this interlayer show a desirable initial capacity of 999.21 mAh·g−1 at 1 C and a durable cyclic stability with a decay rate of only 0.04% per cycle over 300 cycles. Moreover, a high area capacity of 4.82 mAh·cm−2 is also obtained even under increased sulfur loading (5.12 mg·cm−2) and a lean-electrolyte condition (E/S = 4.8 µL·mg−1).

However, the precise timing and control of the activity of central atoms is a key problem to ensure the further development of catalysts. Revealing the correlation between the catalytic activity of the central atom and the coordination environment (atomic species, coordination number, and geometric configuration) is regarded as quite crucial for solving this key problem. Along these lines, in this work, Fe as the central atom and N, S, and P doped porous graphene (DPG) as the matrix material were used to systematically study the correlation between the coordination environment and the stability, catalytic activity of the catalyst. From the acquired results, it was demonstrated that: (1) The binding strength between the Fe atom and the N-atom DPG is the highest, and the anchoring strength of the Fe atom on two-element doping doped graphene is relatively low. Under the tetrad coordination condition, the catalyst doped with S and P atoms showed excellent performance in hydrogen evolution and water activation. A moderate correlation between the hydrogen evolution performance (ΔGH∗, EA, and ΔGOH∗) and d-band electronic properties (d-CU and D-SE) under single element doping (four and three coordination) was also detected. In addition, a certain correlation between the Fe atom outer-shell electron (3d 4s) and the hydrogen evolution performance was found. A weak correlation between the electronic properties of the double element doped graphene and the hydrogen evolution performance was also confirmed from our simulations. The results are of great significance for the regulation of the single-atom catalyst activity.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy

Self-Assembled Networks for Regulating Lithium Polysulfides in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Inhibiting the shuttle effect caused by soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is of importance for lithium-sulfur (Li−S) batteries. Here, a strategy was developed to construct protective layers by self-assembly networks to regulate the LiPSs. 2,5-Dichloropyridine (25DCP) holds two kinds of functional groups. Among them, the two C−Cl bonds were nucleophilic substituted by S in LiPSs to form long chains. The pyridine N interacted with Li in other LiPSs via Li bonds to form a short chain. As a result, the long chains were cross-linked by the short chain to form an insoluble network. The as-prepared network covered the sulfur electrode interface to suppress the shuttle effect of the subsequently generated LiPSs. Furthermore, 25DCP improved the redox dynamics by changing the energy level and electronic structure of the sulfur species. Therefore, the Li−S batteries with 25DCP exhibited good electrochemical performance. This work provides a feasible strategy for regulating the LiPSs.",ChemSusChem
Molecular dynamics simulation study of drugs adsorption in UiO-66,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are novel porous materials that have been extensively used in sensors, catalysis, gas storage and separation, and drug deliver owing to their adjustable pore size, large surface area and high porosity. Among diverse MOFs, UiO-66 can be a promising carrier for drug delivery due to high porosity and chemical stability. However, the adsorption mechanism of drugs in UiO-66 has not been identified and need a further investigation. Hence, we utilized molecular dynamic (MD) simulation to investigate the adsorption mechanism of UiO-66 as drug carriers. The MD simulation of UiO-66 exhibits the busulfan loading of 80 %, ibuprofen of 20 % and 5-fluorouracil of 30 %, respectively. We also demonstrated that the host-guest interaction between UiO-66 and drugs is dominated by the Van der Waals force. UiO-66 shows the highest affinity for busulfan compared with ibuprofen and 5-fluorouracil. In addition, it is certified the linear relation between the adsorption atoms and the interaction energy, which could help us to predict the interaction energy between drugs and UiO-66 by the contact atoms.",Zeitschrift fur Anorganische und Allgemeine Chemie
Understanding the Catalytic Kinetics of Polysulfide Redox Reactions on Transition Metal Compounds in Li-S Batteries,"© Because of their high energy density, low cost, and environmental friendliness, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are one of the potential candidates for the next-generation energy-storage devices. However, they have been troubled by sluggish reaction kinetics for the insoluble Li2S product and capacity degradation because of the severe shuttle effect of polysulfides. These problems have been overcome by introducing transition metal compounds (TMCs) as catalysts into the interlayer of modified separator or sulfur host. This review first introduces the mechanism of sulfur redox reactions. The methods for studying TMC catalysts in Li-S batteries are provided. Then, the recent advances of TMCs (such as metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal selenides, metal nitrides, metal phosphides, metal carbides, metal borides, and heterostructures) as catalysts and some helpful design and modulation strategies in Li-S batteries are highlighted and summarized. At last, future opportunities toward TMC catalysts in Li-S batteries are presented.",ACS Nano
Compositing MXenes with hierarchical ZIF-67/cobalt hydroxide via controllable in situ etching for a high-performance supercapacitor,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.In this study, hierarchical MXene@ZIF-67/core-shell/yolk-shell cobalt hydroxide (MXene@CS-ZCH/MXene@YS-ZCH) and MXene@hollow cobalt hydroxide (MXene@Ho-CH) composites were prepared via the in situ gradient etching of a cubic ZIF-67 loaded MXene. The interlayer hierarchical cobalt hydroxide nanostructures ensure efficient electron transfer and the three-dimensional (3D) configurations avoid the accumulation/self-aggregation of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials. Meanwhile, the MXene can significantly improve electron transfer as a conductive substrate. The MXene@Ho-CH electrode shows excellent rate performance and cycling stability. This work provides a strategy for achieving MXene compositing with hierarchical core-shell/yolk-shell/hollow (CS/YS/Ho) structured MOF derivatives for electrochemical energy storage.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers
Recent advances in cobalt-based catalysts for efficient electrochemical hydrogen evolution: a review,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Hydrogen (H2) is a new type of renewable energy that can meet people's growing energy needs and is environmentally friendly. In order to improve the industrial application prospects and electrochemical performance of hydrogen evolution catalysts, extensive research on transition metal materials has been carried out. Among the many catalytic materials, cobalt is an element with potential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its abundant reserves, low cost, and small energy barrier for H adsorption.

"Recent progress of sub-1 nm nanomaterials: synthesis, polymer-analogue properties and applications in redox catalysis","© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sub-1 nm nanomaterials (SNMs) have attracted attention for their novel structures and size-related properties. In the past decade, various SNMs were synthesized, such as nanowires, nanorings, nanosheets, nanobelts, nanotubes, and other superstructures. We discussed their synthetic strategies systematically, including the ligand pathway and the cluster-nuclei co-assembly pathway. In addition, SNMs exhibit unique size-related properties. Firstly, SNWs show polymer-analogue properties due to their sub-nanometric size and ultrahigh aspect ratio. We illustrate the polymer-analogue properties on both microscopic and macroscopic scales. The macroscopic assemblies of SNWs can be widely applied for organic liquid storage, energy, and optical applications. Finally, we summarized the applications of SNMs in redox catalysis. Their extraordinary catalytic activity is attributed to their large specific surface area and electronic delocalization at the sub-nanometric scale. We hope this feature article can provide new viewpoints on the design and applications of SNMs.",Chemical Communications
"M2(CHOO)4 paddlewheel of metal organic frameworks (M = Co, Mo, Ir) with open metal sites as anode materials of Na/K ion batteries: a theoretical study","© 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The adsorption of Na/Na+ and K/K+ on the three open metal site formate paddlewheels (PWs) of metal-organic frameworks with different metals from the first row of TM (Co-PW), the second row of TM (Mo-PW), and the third row of TM (Ir-PW) were examined to determine if they could be used in NIBs and KIBs. Na/Na+ and K/K+ adsorption energies were measured in the range of −203.5 to −42.1 kJ/mol and −208.4 to −43.7 kJ/mol, respectively. Co-PW cannot serve as a suitable example for NIBs and KIBs since atomic Na and K are both adsorbed more favourably than ionic ones. Ir-PW is suitable only for NIBs with a positive ΔEcell of −14.3 kJ/mol for Na/Na+ adsorption. Mo-PW is a potential candidate as anode material for both Na-ion batteries (NIBs) and K-ion batteries (KIBs) with Ecell of −91.0 and −34.8 kJ/mol with related Vcell of 1.97 and 0.75 V because both Na+ and K+ are much more feasible to adsorption on Mo-PW than Na and K. Although four atoms of Na and K with a theoretical capacity of 288.2 mAh/g toward sodium and potassium can be exothermally adsorbed on the Mo-PW, the ΔEcell and Vcell of the fourth K are close to zero.",Molecular Physics
Regulating f orbital of Tb electronic reservoir to activate stepwise and dual-directional sulfur conversion reaction,"© 2022 The Authors. InfoMat published by UESTC and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.The sluggish kinetics in multistep sulfur redox reaction with different energy requirements for each step, is considered as the crucial handicap of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. Designing an electron reservoir, which can dynamically release electron to/accept electron from sulfur species during discharge/charge, is the ideal strategy for realizing stepwise and dual-directional polysulfide electrocatalysis. Herein, a single Tb3+/4+ oxide with moderate unfilled f orbital is synthetized as an electron reservoir to optimize polysulfide adsorption via Tb–S and N···Li bonds, reduce activation energy barrier, expedite electron/Li+ transport, and selectively catalyze both long-chain and short-chain polysulfide conversions during charge and discharge. As a result, Tb electron reservoir enables stable operation of low-capacity decay (0.087% over 500 cycles at 1 C), high sulfur loading (5.2 mg cm−2) and electrolyte-starved (7.5 μL mg−1) Li–S batteries. This work could unlock the potential of f orbital engineering for high-energy battery systems. (Figure presented.).",InfoMat
Hierarchical MoO2/ZnIn2S4Schottky Heterojunction Stimulated Photocatalytic H2Evolution under Visible Light,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.A Schottky junction is an ideal candidate for photocatalytic H2 evolution since the photo-induced charge kinetics of semiconductors can be harnessed via coupling with metals. In this work, the ZnIn2S4 semiconductor and metallic MoO2 are successfully integrated to form a composite photocatalyst, which is analogous to the conventional metal-semiconductor Schottky junction. In such a heterojunction, hierarchical ZnIn2S4 flower-like structures are in situ grown on MoO2 nanosheets. The experimental and computational results suggest that the Schottky barrier successfully suppresses the recombination of photocarriers, while MoO2 further extends the spectral range of light absorption and decreases the activation energy of H2 evolution. As a result, the optimal MoO2/ZnIn2S4 composite exhibits a 28.2 times higher H2 evolution rate (3730.5 μmol/g/h) than pristine ZnIn2S4 under visible light.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Enhancing carbon dioxide reduction electrocatalysis by tuning metal-support interactions: a first principles study,"© 2022 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.The electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an extremely potential technique to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality, but the development of electrocatalysts with high activity, excellent product selectivity, and long-term durability remains a great challenge. Herein, the role of metal-supports interaction (MSI) between different active sites (including single and bimetallic atom sites consisting of Cu and Ni atoms) and carbon-based supports (including C2N, C3N4, N-coordination graphene, and graphdiyne) on catalytic activity, product selectivity, and thermodynamic stability towards CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) is systematically investigated by first principles calculations. Our results show that MSI is mainly related to the charge transfer behavior from metal sites to supports, and different MSI leads to diverse magnetic moments and d-band centers. Subsequently, the adsorption and catalytic performance can be efficiently improved by tuning MSI. Notably, the bimetallic atom supported graphdiyne not only exhibits a better catalytic activity, higher product selectivity, and higher thermodynamic stability, but also effectively inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction. This finding provides a new research idea and optimization strategy for the rational design of high-efficiency CRR catalysts.",Green Chemical Engineering
Co/Zn-metal organic frameworks derived functional matrix for highly active amorphous Se stabilization and advanced lithium storage,"© 2022, Youke Publishing Co.,Ltd.Lithium–selenium batteries, as an advanced rechargeable battery system, have attracted wide attention. However, its application is hurdled by the ambiguous underlying mechanism such as the unclear active phase and the key role of the host materials. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) functional matrix derived from the Co/Zn-metal organic framework is synthesized to unravel the questions raised. It reveals that the strong interaction and voids in the 3D matrix serve to anchor the amorphous Se with high electrochemical properties. The obtained 3DC/Se exhibits 544.2 and 273.2 mAh·g−1 at current densities of 0.1C and 2.0C, respectively, with a diffusion-controlled mechanism. The excessive amount of Se beyond the loading capacity of the matrix leads to the formation of trigonal phase Se, which shows an unsatisfying electrochemical property.

The carbon chain growth during the onset of CVD graphene formation on γ-Al2O3 is promoted by unsaturated CH2 ends,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Chemical vapor deposition of methane onto a template of alumina (Al2O3) nanoparticles is a prominent synthetic strategy of graphene meso-sponge, a new class of nano porous carbon materials consisting of single-layer graphene walls. However, the elementary steps controlling the early stages of graphene growth on Al2O3 surfaces are still not well understood. In this study, density functional theory calculations provide insights into the initial stages of graphene growth. We have modelled the mechanism of CH4 dissociation on the (111), (110), (100), and (001) γ-Al2O3 surfaces. Subsequently, we have considered the reaction pathway leading to the formation of a C6 ring. The γ-Al2O3(110) and γ-Al2O3(100) are both active for CH4 dissociation, but the (100) surface has higher catalytic activity towards the carbon growth reaction. The overall mechanism involves the formation of the reactive intermediate CH2* that then can couple to form CnH2n* (n = 2-6) intermediates with unsaturated CH2 ends. The formation of these species, which are not bound to the surface-active sites, promotes the sustained carbon growth in a nearly barrierless process. Also, the short distance between terminal carbon atoms leads to strong interactions, which might lead to the high activity between unsaturated CH2* of the hydrocarbon chain. Analysis of the electron localization and geometries of the carbon chains reveals the formation of C-Al-σ bonds with the chain growing towards the vacuum rather than C-Al-π bonds covering the γ-Al2O3(100) surface. This growth behaviour prevents catalyst poisoning during the initial stage of graphene nucleation.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
"Organo-macrocycle-containing hierarchical metal-organic frameworks and cages: design, structures, and applications","© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Developing hierarchical ordered systems is challenging.

Effective Formation of a Mn-ZIF-67 Nanofibrous Network via Electrospinning: An Active Electrocatalyst for OER in Alkaline Medium,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Finding the active center in a bimetallic zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF) is highly crucial for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In the present study, we constructed a bimetallic ZIF system with cobalt and manganese metal ions and subjected it to an electrospinning technique for feasible fiber formation. The obtained nanofibers delivered a lower overpotential value of 302 mV at a benchmarking current density of 10 mA cm-2 in an electrocatalytic OER study under alkaline conditions. The obtained Tafel slope and charge-transfer resistance values were 125 mV dec-1 and 4 ω, respectively. The kinetics of the reaction is mainly attributed from the ratio of metals (Co and Mn) present in the catalyst. Jahn-Teller distortion reveals that the electrocatalytic active center on the Mn-incorporated ZIF-67 nanofibers (Mn-ZIF-67-NFs) was found to be Mn3+ along with the Mn2+ and Co2+ ions on the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, respectively, where Co2+ ions tend to suppress the distortion, which is well supported by density functional theory analysis, molecular orbital study, and magnetic studies.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Improved Electrochemical Performance of NTs-WS2@C Nanocomposites for Lithium-Ion and Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Even though WS2 nanotubes (NTs-WS2) have great potential as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) thanks to their unusual layered structure, their conductivity and cycling stability are far from satisfactory. To tackle these issues, carbon-coated WS2 (NTs-WS2@C) nanocomposites were prepared through a facile synthesis method that involved precipitating a carbon precursor (20% sucrose) on WS2 nanotubes, followed by annealing treatment under an argon environment. Thanks to the presence of highly conductive and mechanically robust carbon on the outer surface, NTs-WS2@C nanocomposites show improved electrochemical performance compared with bare NTs-WS2. After 60 cycles at 80 mA g-1 current density, the cells display high capacities of 305 mAh g-1 in LIBs and 152 mAh g-1 in SIBs, respectively. As the current density increases to 600 mA g-1, it provides specific capacities of 209 and 115 mAh g-1, correspondingly. The enhanced electrochemical performance in LIBs and SIBs is primarily attributed to the synergistic effects of the tubular architecture of WS2, carbon network and stable nanocomposite structure, which can effectively constrain volume variation during the metal ions intercalation/deintercalation processes.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Non-Negligible Role of Multifunctional MXene Hosts for Li-S Batteries: Anchoring and Electrocatalysis,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted great enthusiasm in recent years. Nevertheless, the serious shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn), poor conductivity of S and intermediate products, and relatively slow dynamics make its commercial application face severe challenges. Here, functionalized M2CT2 MXenes (M = Ti, Nb, Cr; T = bare, O, F, OH) were used as the sulfur host to build multifunctional cathodes, in which the inhibition of the shuttle effect by the anchoring effect and accelerating discharging/charging kinetics by electrocatalysis were studied via first-principles. The strong anchoring strength of M2CO2/M2CF2 to Li2Sn could effectively suppress the shuttle behavior. The anchoring ability of MXenes is a double-edged sword, and moderate anchoring strength should be considered. Compared comprehensively, Nb2CO2 has a better electrocatalysis performance for the sulfur reduction reaction during discharging. It also accelerates the decomposition of Li2S and migration of Li+ on the cathode which increases charging kinetics. The improvement in kinetics is related to the enhancement of electronic conductivities of Nb2CO2-Li2Sn composites. In short, Nb2CO2-based multifunctional sulfur cathodes effectively suppress the shuttle effect and improve reaction kinetics. This work expands the application of the MXene family, especially providing guidelines for the utilization of Nb-based MXene in energy storage.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C

Influence of Ice Templating on Oxygen Reduction Catalytic Activity of Metal-Free Heteroatom-Doped Mesoporous Carbon Derived from Polypyrrole for Zinc–Air Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The development of highly active, cost-effective, and durable, noble metal-free oxygen reduction electrocatalysts is inevitable for the full-fledged implementation of fuel cells and zinc–air batteries. This work reports the synthesis of heteroatom (N, P, S)-doped metal-free mesoporous carbon-based electrocatalyst derived from polypyrrole by combining the ice templating, freeze-drying, and carbonization processes. The correlation between the structure and electrochemical activity of the polypyrrole-derived carbon-based electrocatalyst in the presence and absence of ice templating is investigated. The optimized electrocatalyst, aided by the ice-templating and freeze-drying step, shows an onset and half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.94 and 0.78 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, in an alkaline electrolyte (0.1 m KOH). Later, the application of the optimized electrocatalyst is demonstrated in a primary zinc–air battery (ZAB) cell. The results prove that the ZAB device performance based on the homemade catalyst is on par with that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C cathode. The catalyst performance is correlated with the heteroatom doping and the enhanced porosity of the sample benefitted from ice templating. Ultimately, this work depicts a facile and rational synthesis of a truly metal-free electrocatalyst for the primary ZABs that can be a potential replacement for state-of-the-art systems.",Energy Technology
Nitrogen Balance on Ni–N–C Promotor for High-Energy Lithium-Sulfur Pouch Cells,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.The viability of lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries toward real implementation directly correlates with unlocking lithium polysulfide (LiPS) evolution reactions. Along this line, designing promotors with the function of synchronously relieving LiPS shuttle and promoting sulfur conversion is critical. Herein, the nitrogen evolution on hierarchical and atomistic Ni–N–C electrocatalyst, mainly pertaining to the essential subtraction, reservation and coordination of nitrogen atoms, is manipulated to attain favorable Li–S pouch cell performances. Such rational evolution behavior realizes the “nitrogen balance” in simultaneously regulating the Ni–N coordination environment, Ni single atom loading, abundant vacancy defects, active nitrogen and electron conductivity, and maximizing the electrocatalytic activity elevation of Ni–N–C system. With such merit, the cathode harvests favorable performances in a soft-packaged pouch cell prototype even under high sulfur mass loading and lean electrolyte usage. A specific energy density up to 405.1 Wh kg−1 is harvested by the 0.5-Ah-level pouch cell.",Advanced Science
Binary Metal Single Atom Electrocatalysts with Synergistic Catalytic Activity toward High-Rate and High Areal-Capacity Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries with high theoretical energy density have been long considered as an alternative energy storage device to lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the polysulfide shuttle effects trigger fast capacity decay and short battery lifespan, severely hampering their practical utilizations. Herein, an efficient electrocatalyst comprising of nitrogen (N)-coordinated binary metal single atoms (SAs) implanted within a hierarchical porous carbon skeleton (Fe/Co-N-HPC) is constructed to trap and catalyze polysulfides conversion through a separator coating strategy. It is demonstrated that the introduction of Co atom can enrich the electron number of Fe active center, thereby realizing the distinct synergistic catalytic effect of binary metal SAs and improving the bidirectional catalysis of Li–S redox reaction. As a result, Li–S batteries with the Fe/Co-N-HPC-modified separator exhibit outstanding rate capability (740 mAh g−1 at 5.0 C), and superior long-term cyclic stability (694 mAh g−1 after 600 cycles at 1.0 C). Increasing the sulfur loading to 4.8 mg cm−2, a remarkable areal capacity of 6.13 mAh cm−2 is achieved. Furthermore, in situ X-ray diffraction and theoretical simulation results verify the catalysis mechanism of binary metal SAs by changing the rate-determining steps, providing new directions for constructing high-performance Li–S batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
Development of Crystalline Covalent Triazine Frameworks to Enable in Situ Preparation of Single-Atom Ni-N3-C for Efficient Electrochemical CO2Reduction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The synthesis of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with fully conjugated nitrogen-enriched architectures is a long-term challenging subject. Herein, a solvent- and catalyst-free approach was implemented for the first time to create crystalline CTFs based on a new trimerization of amidine-type monomers. A highly crystalline triazine-linked polymer with a specific surface area of 255 m2 g-1 was achieved, whereas additional aldehydes were no longer required. Furthermore, an in situ transformation strategy was developed by exploring a molten salt (ZnCl2) to promote this new condensation, so as to convert as-obtained CTFs into isolated single-atom catalysts (SACs). Interestingly, the usage of ZnCl2 not only enables a crystalline CTF with a significantly enhanced surface area, up to 663 m2 g-1 but also provides a means of realizing atomically dispersed nickel (Ni) catalysts with unique Ni-N3-C sites. As a result, the resulting SAC exhibits efficient electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction performance, where a maximum Faradaic efficiency for carbon monoxide (CO) production of 97.5% at -0.52 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and an excellent turnover frequency (3192 h-1) with a current density of 23.32 mA cm-2 at -1.02 V can be obtained, respectively. We anticipate our findings will facilitate new possibilities for the development of crystalline porous organic frameworks and SACs for various catalysis.",ACS Materials Letters
Working Principles of Lithium Metal Anode in Pouch Cells,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium metal battery has been considered as one of the potential candidates for next-generation energy storage systems. However, the dendrite growth issue in Li anodes results in low practical energy density, short lifespan, and poor safety performance. The strategies in suppressing Li dendrite growth are mostly conducted in materials-level coin cells, while their validity in device-level pouch cells is still under debate. It is imperative to address dendrite issues in pouch cells to realize the practical application of Li metal batteries. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the failure mechanism and regulation strategies of Li metal anodes in practical pouch cells. First, the gaps between the scientific findings in materials-level coin cells and device-level pouch cells are underscored. Specific attention is paid to the mechanistic understanding and quantitative discussion on the failure mechanisms of pouch-type Li metal batteries. Subsequently, recently proposed strategies are reviewed to suppress dendrite growth in pouch cells. The state-of-the-art electrochemical performance of pouch cells, especially the cell-level energy density and lifespan, is critically concerned. The review concludes with an attempt to summarize the scientific and engineering understandings of pouch-type Li metal anodes and propose some novel insights for the practical applications of Li metal batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials
Copper Nanoparticle/N-Doped Ti3C2TxMXene Hybrids with Enhanced Peroxidase-like Activity for Colorimetric Glucose Sensing,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.As a low-cost support, MXenes have attracted more and more attention in developing nanoenzymes with enhanced peroxidase- or oxidase-like activity. In this paper, we report a simple way to synthesize a N-doped Ti3C2Tx MXene, which provides a support platform for developing MXene-based nanozymes with an attractive structure and performance. By anchoring copper nanoparticles on N-doped Ti3C2Tx Cu nanoparticles, Cu nanoparticles (NPs)/N-doped Ti3C2Tx with satisfactory structural stability was prepared, displaying a synergistic effect and enhanced peroxidase-like activity. The superior peroxidase-like activity was confirmed by the oxidation kinetics of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and density functional theory calculations. The characteristics of peroxidase-like nanozymes have promoted the development of colorimetric biosensors to evaluate the performance of Cu NPs/N-doped Ti3C2Tx. As expected, the nanozyme exhibits gratifying sensitivity, high selectivity, a low detection limit of 5 μM, and practicability in the detection of serum samples. Remarkably, the Cu NPs/N-doped Ti3C2Tx has remarkable stability and maintains its peroxidase-like activity after 1 month of storage. This work has laid a solid foundation for guiding the design of metal NPs/nonmetal-doped MXenes with outstanding peroxidase-like activity and expanding their application in biosensors.",ACS Applied Nano Materials
"Sulfur Cathodes with Self-Organized Cellulose Nanofibers in Stable Ah-Level, >300 Wh kg−1 Lithium–Sulfur Cells","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The realization of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries as an energy storage technology depends on unlocking practical performance at commercially relevant pouch cell scales. Typically, the heterogeneous and porous nature of large scale, high sulfur loading Li–S batteries require increased electrolyte levels and impede electronic conductivity.

Here, the successful development of a new cathode using highly-carboxylated and negatively surface charged cellulose nanofibers as a backbone that addresses these issues and delivers an ordered, dense architecture whilst maintaining long term cycle life, is reported. Taken together this leads to an Ah-level pouch cell with a peak capacity above 1200 mAh g−1 and an areal capacity of around 15 mAh cm−2, which achieves a high gravimetric energy density of up to 330 Wh kg−1 and volumetric energy density of 480 Wh L−1.

Improving the activity of electrocatalysts is critical for increasing the efficiency of these energy conversion processes. However, the tailored design of highly active electrocatalysts for practical applications remains challenging. In this regard, we present an overview of the general design principles for efficient electrocatalysts and application of these principles in different electrocatalytic processes. Specifically, enhancing the intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts by electronic state modulation through heteroatom doping, vacancy introduction, interfacial electronic transfer and strain engineering is introduced.

Scalable Dry-Pressed Electrodes Based on Holey Graphene,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.ConspectusHoley graphene (hG) is a structural derivative of graphene with arrays of through-thickness holes of a few to tens of nanometers in diameter, randomly distributed across the nanosheet surfaces. In most bulk preparation methods, the holes on hG sheets are preferentially generated from the pre-existing defects on graphene. Therefore, contrary to intuitive belief, hG is not necessarily more defective than the intact graphene. Instead, it retains essential parent properties, including high electrical conductivity, high surface area, mechanical robustness, and chemical inertness. Furthermore, the added holey structural motif imparts unique properties that are not present in unmodified graphene, making hG advantageous in numerous applications such as sensing, membranes, reinforcements, and electrochemical energy storage. In particular, the presence of holes enhances the mass transport through the nanosheet plane and thus significantly reduces tortuosity. This difference is a key advantage for using hG in energy storage applications where the transport of ions through the thickness becomes more hindered as the electrode thickness increases to meet practical energy density requirements.An unexpected discovery is that the holes of the hG sheets enable the dry hG powder to be directly compressed into robust monoliths. hG not only can be pressed into monoliths by itself but also can host other electrochemically active materials as a compressible matrix. This important yet unique property, which is not available for other carbon materials including intact graphene, significantly broadens the application horizon in energy storage applications. With the dry compressibility, electrodes with ultrahigh mass loading and thus ultrahigh areal capacity may be conveniently fabricated without toxic solvents or parasitic binders, which are required in conventional slurry-based approaches for electrode fabrication. The dry-press electrode preparation process can be completed within minutes regardless of mass loading. In comparison, high-mass-loading electrodes for advanced battery chemistries using conventional fabrication methods often need stringent and time-consuming process control. hG can also be combined with electrochemically active battery materials while maintaining dry compressibility. This has allowed the unprecedented, convenient manipulation of a wide variety of thick electrode compositions and architectures, which provides not only outstanding performance but also new physical insights for various battery chemistries.In this Account, we first present some basic observations on the dry compressibility of hG as well as the mechanistic investigations from atomistic modeling rationalizing this unique property. We then showcase the applications of neat and composite dry-pressed hG electrodes for various energy storage platforms including supercapacitors, lithium (Li) ion batteries, Li-O2 batteries, and Li-S/Se batteries. The preparation and performance of thick electrodes with practical mass loadings and unique electrode architecture manipulation, both enabled by the dry compressibility of hG, are highlighted and discussed.",Accounts of Chemical Research

Coupling NixSy-Ni2P heterostructure nanoarrays on Ni foam as environmentally friendly electrocatalyst for overall water splitting,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCThe development of efficient, cheap and stable electrodes is the key to achieve the industrialization of hydrogen production from electrochemical water splitting. In this paper, NixSy-Ni2P mixtures on Ni foam (NixSy-Ni2P/NF) were synthesized by hydrothermal process followed by sulfurization and phosphorization approach. The combination of NixSy and Ni2P exposes a large number of active sites, thus greatly improving the catalytic activity of the material. As expected, the NixSy-Ni2P/NF material exhibits ultra-small overpotentials of 211 and 320 mV for water oxidation reaction at the current densities of 10 and 100 mA/cm2, respectively. What is noteworthy is that the material also present superior hydrogen evolution reaction properties (122 mV@10 mA cm−2). Moreover, when the material is acted as a bifunction electrode to drive the overall water splitting, only a cell voltage of 1.54 V is required to drive a current density of 10 mA/cm2, which is one of the superior catalytic properties reported up to now. Experimental results show that the good electrochemistry performance of the NixSy-Ni2P/NF material is attributed to the improved charge transfer rate, exposure of more active site and superior electrical conductivity. This work provides an effective way to explore environmentally friendly catalysts based on transition metal sulfide and phosphide.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
Regulating the Coordination Environment of Mesopore-Confined Single Atoms from Metalloprotein-MOFs for Highly Efficient Biocatalysis,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit unparalleled atomic utilization and catalytic efficiency, yet it is challenging to modulate SACs with highly dispersed single-atoms, mesopores, and well-regulated coordination environment simultaneously and ultimately maximize their catalytic efficiency. Here, a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric-centered SACs (Fe-SACs) is developed successfully via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis. The results demonstrate that the constructed metalloprotein-MOF-templated Fe-SACs achieve up to 23-fold and 47-fold higher activity compared to those using metal ions as the single-atom source and those with large mesopores induced by Zn evaporation, respectively, as well as up to a 25-fold and 1900-fold higher catalytic efficiency compared to natural enzymes and natural-enzyme-immobilized MOFs. Furthermore, this strategy can be generalized to a variety of metal-containing metalloproteins and enzymes. The enhanced catalytic activity of Fe-SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single-atom active sites induced by metalloproteins. Furthermore, the developed Fe-SACs act as an excellent and effective therapeutic platform for suppressing tumor cell growth. This work advances the development of highly efficient SACs using metalloproteins-MOFs as a template with diverse biotechnological applications.",Advanced Materials

Herein, a novel, flexible, and robust quasi-solid-state electrolyte (QSSE) with a “tree-trunk” design is reported for ultralong-life lithium-metal batteries (LMBs). An in-situ-grown metal–organic framework (MOF) layer covers the cellulose-based framework to form hierarchical ion-channels, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability. A conductivity of 1.36 × 10−3 S cm−1, a transference number of 0.72, an electrochemical window of 5.26 V, and a good rate performance are achieved. The flexible LMBs fabricated with as-designed QSSEs deliver areal capacity of up to 3.1 mAh cm−2 at the initial cycle with high mass loading of 14.8 mg cm−2 in Li-NCM811 cells and can retain ≈80% capacity retention after 300 cycles. An ultralong-life of 3000 cycles (6000 h) is also achieved in Li-LiFePO4 cells. This work presents a promising route in constructing a flexible QSSE toward ultralong-life LMBs, and also provides a design rationale for material and structure development in the area of energy storage and conversion.",Advanced Materials

A review on the effects of doping elements on the properties and applications of lignin-based carbon materials,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lignin, which consists of about 30% organic carbon, is considered as one of the most ample biopolymers in the world. The conversion of lignin into materials with higher added value, such as porous carbon, is a good example of a green circular economy. Lignin-based carbon materials have excellent properties, which are greatly enhanced by the doping of elements. In this paper, we start with the structure and composition of lignin, and after that, there is a systematic review of the performance and applications of lignin-based doping with non-metallic elements (O, N, S, P, etc.) and metallic elements (Cu, Co, Ni, Fe, Mn, etc.) to prepare porous carbon electrode materials. Finally, the near-term challenges and prospects of lignin-based carbon materials for progressive energy storage devices are presented. On the basis of the review, a purposeful summary of the preparation methods of each doping atom with the influence of different types of lignin is presented. At the same time, the advantages and disadvantages of each doping atom as well as the doping methods are dissected. The aim is to provide theoretical guidance for the design, preparation and performance optimisation of heteroatom-doped lignin-based carbon materials for future practical applications such as supercapacitors, adsorbents and catalysts.",Sustainable Energy and Fuels
Flame-Retardant Crosslinked Polymer Stabilizes Graphite–Silicon Composite Anode for Self-Extinguishing Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The graphite–silicon composite (GSC) anode materials with high specific capacity and excellent conductivity hold intriguing promise for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, commercializing GSC is hindered by its poor cyclability and safety issues. Here, a fire-resistant polymer crosslinked with ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) to improve the electrochemical properties and enhance the safety of the GSC anode is designed. The crosslinked polymer not only forms a 3D network structure to strengthen the mechanical properties of the composite electrode but also uniformly covers the electrode surface to effectively minimize the side-reaction between electrodes and electrolyte, thereby improving its rate capacity and cycling stability. As a result, the GSC/PAA anode crosslinked with 10 wt% APP (GSC/10APP-PAA) delivers a high capacity of 315 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C and stably operates for 1000 cycles with 0.03% capacity decay cycle−1. More importantly, the peak heat release rate and the total heat release value of GSC/10APP-PAA anode are significantly depressed from 0.35 to 0.1 J s−1, and from 1.6 to 0.6 J g−1, respectively, thereby reducing the self-extinguishing time, which proves that the crosslinked polymer plays a fireproof role in the process of the thermal runaway of LIBs.",Advanced Energy Materials

"N, S-Coordinated Co Single Atomic Catalyst Boosting Adsorption and Conversion of Lithium Polysulfides for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Boosting reversible solid-liquid phase transformation from lithium polysulfides to Li2S and suppressing the shuttling of lithium polysulfides from the cathode to the lithium anode are critical challenges in lithium-sulfur batteries. Here, sulfiphilic single atomic cobalt implanted in lithiophilic heteroatoms-dopped carbon (SACo@HC) matrix with a CoN3S structure for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries is reported. Density functional theory calculation and in situ experiments demonstrate that the optimal CoN3S structure in SACo@HC can effectively improve the adsorption and redox conversion efficiency of lithium polysulfides. Consequently, the S-SACo@HC composite with sulfur loading of 80 wt% delivers a high capacity of 1425.1 mAh g−1 at 0.05 C and outstanding rate performance with 745.9 mAh g−1 at 4 C. Furthermore, a capacity of 680.8 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C with a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (6 µL mg−1) can be achieved even after 300 cycles. With the harsh conditions of lean electrolyte (E/S = 4 µL mg−1) and high sulfur loading (5.4 mg cm−2), a superior area capacity of 5.8 mAh cm−2 can be obtained. This work contributes to building a profound understanding of the adsorption and interface engineering of lithium polysulfides and provides ideas to tackle the long-standing polysulfide shuttle problem of lithium-sulfur batteries.",Small

In this work, the well-designed multichannel carbon fibers decorated by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and CoS nanoparticles (MCF/CoS/CNT) are synthesized and serve as the flexible sulfur host. The in situ grown CNTs network and embedded CoS enhance the overall conductivity of electrode and facilitate the redox reaction of sulfur-related electrochemistry. Benefitting from these merits, the MCF/CoS/CNT-based cathode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 927 mAh g−1 after 180 cycles with a low decay of 0.034% per cycle at 1.0 C. A superb areal capacity of 5.2 mAh cm−2 could be obtained under a high sulfur loading of 6.3 mg cm−2 and an ultralow electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6.5 μL mg−1 after 100 cycles.
