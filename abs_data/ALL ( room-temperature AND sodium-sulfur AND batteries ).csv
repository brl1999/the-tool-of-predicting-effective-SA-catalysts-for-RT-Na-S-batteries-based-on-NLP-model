In situ generation of CeCoSx bimetallic sulfide derived from “egg-box” seaweed biomass on S/N co-doped graphene aerogels for flexible all solid-state supercapacitors,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Practical applications of flexible electrochemical energy storage devices are still limited by the lack of robust mechanical structures and high capacitive storage capabilities. Herein, the 3D CeCoSx-SA/GF porous aerogels are designed and prepared based on sodium alginate, which possess a special structure that can be explained by the so-called “egg-box” model. Each metal ion can be paired with the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of the G monomer on two adjacent sodium alginate molecular chains. Melamine foam is used as carrier for graphene/sodium alginate impregnation and plays an important role on significantly limiting the agglomeration of graphene nanosheets due to their strong π-π stacking. The fabricated electrode based on CeCoSx-SA/GF shows an excellent electrochemical capacitance of 873.3F/g at the current density of 1A/g. In addition, the capacitance retention rate can still remain 87.1 % after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 8 A/g. Moreover, the fabricated all-solid state asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled with CoCeSx-SA/GF and active carbon shows an energy density of 29.58 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 801 W kg−1. For practical applications, the fabricated supercapacitor device can power a multifunctional display for 28 mins and illuminate a small light bulb for 3 mins. Moreover, the KOH/polyvinyl alcohol gel-electrolyte was used to fabricate high-strength and flexible CeCoSx-SA/GF/PVA/KOH composite film electrode, which can be bent at various angles (0°-180°) and can be twisted into various shapes. Notably, the CeCoSx-SA/GF/PVA/KOH composite film can lift plastic bottles containing 500 mL (500 g) and 1000 mL (1 kg) water, respectively, indicating that it has great application potential for wearable and portable electronic devices.",Chemical Engineering Journal
High-performance and sodiation mechanism of a pulse potential-electrodeposited Sb-Zn alloy as an anode for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Antimony-based alloys have attracted extensive attention as promising anode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity. However, the current process used to fabricate Sb-based alloys results in an almost powdery product, which leads to inadequate ion penetration and impedes electron transport when the alloys mix with nonconductive binders. Here, we have developed an advanced pulse potential electrodeposition method to prepare binder-free Sb-Zn alloys on copper foil and form a self-supported anode of SIBs. The Sb-Zn alloy anodes exhibited remarkably stable and robust Na-ion storage performance. Compared with the constant potential electrodeposition method, the Sb-Zn composite prepared using pulse potential electrodeposition exhibits higher charge/discharge capacities, a higher rate capability and superior cycle performance. The initial charge/discharge capacities of the Sb-Zn alloy anode are 377 mAh·g−1/453 mAh·g−1, and the first coulombic efficiency reaches to 83%. The specific capacity retention is 70% after 320 cycles at a charge/discharge current density of 300 mA·g−1. The reaction mechanism and reaction kinetics were determined by performing operando X-ray diffraction spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry investigations. This work provides a potential new starting point for large scalable manufacturing of high-performance Sb-based anodes for SIBs.",Applied Surface Science
Ag nanoparticles embedded in sodiophilic carbon host achieving high-power Na metal batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Sodium (Na) metal with low electrode potential and high theoretical specific capacity has been spotlighted by the commercial market. The layered oxide cathode paired with Na metal anode can offer an energy density comparable to the current LiFePO4-graphite system. Nevertheless, the dendrite growth and poor processability of Na metal seriously hamper its practical application. This study demonstrates that Ag nanoparticles on N,P-doped carbon cloth (NPCC-Ag) provide sodiophilic sites for Na deposition, inducing the formation of a stable NaF-rich interface. The independent composite anodes fabricated by melt infusion strategy exhibit lower polarization and higher stability in the carbonate-based electrolyte. When coupled with NaCrO2 cathode, the composite anode demonstrates a higher specific capacity and Coulombic efficiency at high current density. This work provides a fresh horizon for the preparation of high-performance Na metal anodes, which is valuable for the development of high-power Na metal batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Graphene oxide microrolls as high- content Si carriers boosting Li-ion storage,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.As attractive anode materials of lithium-ion batteries, both microsized and nanosized silicon particles have been investigated widely, but each has lots of insurmountable problems to restrict their practical applications. In this work, combining the advantages of microsized and nanosized Si particles, we reported a new thought for constructing micrometer-sized Si/C particles by embedding Si nanoparticles into graphene oxide (GO)-based mirorolls. Differing to the traditional spherical shape, the resulted Si/C microrolls exhibit a unique elastic coil structure with opening ends, facilitating the stress buffer and fast charge diffusion. Besides, in order to maintain the stability of Si nanoparticles in microrolls, we chose the elastic and deformable liquid metal (LM) as the “cloth”, and sodium alginate (SA) as the “thread”, successfully tailor a novel “tight suit” for each Si nanoparticle by a facile self-assembly process. Thanks to the double protection of the conductive-elastic LM-SA coating and the microroll architecture, the resulted Si@LM-SA@GO microroll anode not only has a high Si content of 69 %, a high tap density of 0.62 g cm−3 and a high initial coulombic efficiency of 85.1 %, but also exhibits a superior volumetric capacity of 2506 mAh cm−3, and a superior cycling performance of 660 mAh cm−3 after 500 cycles at 2 A g−1. The full cell constructed using a LiNiCoMnO2 cathode can achieve a high reversible capacity of 150 mAh g−1 at 1C after 250 cycles, delivering a high-energy density of 510 Wh kg−1.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Lychee seed-derived microporous carbon for high-performance sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSodium-sulfur (Na–S) batteries are regarded as one of the promising next-generation energy storage systems; while being more cost-effective than lithium-sulfur batteries, Na–S batteries also suffer from the shuttle effect. Different strategies to tackle the long-chain polysulfide product shuttling issue have been proposed, mainly focusing on sulfur product confinement with costly materials and complex methods. Seeking high-performance and low-cost electrode material precursors is of great importance to promoting Na–S battery applications. We present a high specific surface area microporous carbon framework synthesized from degradable biowaste, namely lychee seeds, with a facile room-temperature etching process. Unlike the traditional dissolution-precipitation mechanism, a quasi-solid-state route takes place with the help of micropore (0.48 nm) confinement, preventing the formation of long-chain polysulfides for excellent electrochemical performance. The obtained Na–S battery exhibits an outstanding initial reversible discharge specific capacity of 1395 mAh g−1 at 0.2C and still maintains a high capacity of 518 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1.0C. The lychee seed-derived microporous carbon provides insights into sustainable and scalable host fabrication for high-performance sulfur-based batteries.",Carbon

To suit the remedy to the annoying interfacial trouble, a highly efficient ultrasound welding (UW) strategy is rolled out and successfully verified by Na/Beta-Al2O3 interface in one minute. The UW-Na/Beta-Al2O3/UW-Na symmetric cell accompanied by a critical current density of 0.65 mA cm−2 can be cycled stably for over 800 h at 0.1 mA cm−2 at room temperature. Integrating into polyanion-typed Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode with three-dimensional Na+ transport, the room-temperature sodium metal full battery delivers a high energy density of 234 Wh kg−1 under a high power density of 1773 W kg−1.

The characterization results indicated that the MXene/ZnCo2O4 nanocomposites (MZC-W) with a Calliandra haematocephala flower-like structure could be prepared by a two-step hydrothermal method and MZC-W with large specific surface area exhibited significant catalytic activity to the decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP). The decomposition performance of AP on MZC-W (2.0 wt%) showed that the high decomposition temperature of AP was highly reduced by 138.3 °C. For the heat of AP decomposition, it significantly increased to 1474.5 J g−1. During this process, the Ea of AP decomposition was reduced by 56.4%, while the reaction rate of AP decomposition was increased by 11.2 times. The remarkable catalytic activity of MZC-W was attributed to its high specific surface area and the synergistic effect between ZnCo2O4 nanoparticles and MXene nanosheets. Predictably, MZC-W with potential application value could be used as a catalyst to ameliorate the decomposition of AP, while the synthesis method of MZC-W could be used as a simple idea to improve the catalytic activity of metal oxide nanoparticles.",Vacuum
PxSy nanoparticles encapsulated in graphene as highly reversible cathode for sodium ion batteries,"© 2022Herein, phosphorus-mediated sulfur nanoparticles encapsulated in reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (P-SrGO-T) were successfully synthesized as the cathode for sodium ion battery by a ball milling and the following thermal treatment. A series of covalent bonds, such as P–S, C–S–C, C–O–P and C–S–P, are formed in this process, which are in favor of fixing the sulfur and suppressing the parasitic shuttle effect of polysulfide. Benefiting from the graphene sheets and these covalent bonds, a high reversible capacity of 637.4 mAh/g was achieved in P-SrGO-T after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2 A/g. In addition, P-SrGO-T also delivers a high-rate capacity (330.7 mAh/g at 5 A/g) attributing to low charge transfer resistance and faster ion diffusion kinetic.

Oxygen vacancy-mediated amorphous GeOx assisted polysulfide redox kinetics for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The practical applications of room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries have been greatly hindered by the natural sluggish reaction kinetics of sulfur and the shuttle effect of sodium polysulfide (NaPSs). Herein, oxygen vacancy (OV)-mediated amorphous GeOx/nitrogen doped carbon (donated as GeOx/NC) composites were well designed as sulfur hosts for RT Na–S batteries. Experimental and density functional theory studies show that the introduction of oxygen vacancies on GeOx/NC can effectively immobilize polysulfides and accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfides. Meanwhile, the micro-and mesoporous framework, acting as a reactor for storing active S, is conducive to alleviating the expansion of S during the charging/discharging process. Consequently, the S@GeOx/NC cathode affords a reversible capacity of 1017 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles, outstanding rate capability of 333 mA h g−1 at 10.0 A g−1 and long lifespan cyclability of 385 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1200 cycles. This work furnishes a new way for the rational design of metal oxides with oxygen vacancies and boosts the application for RT Na-S batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Rationally designed oxygen vacancy for achieving effective and kinetically boosted Na-Se batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Reasonable chemistry design of selenium hosts to stabilize and transform sodium polyselenide (Na2Sex) is of great significance for high-performance Na-Se batteries. Herein, a hollow nitrogen-doped carbon embedded with oxygen defective Fe2O3 nanoparticles (Fe2O3@NC) has been prepared, which integrates conductivity, polarity and catalytic ability into cooperation and is validated as a suitable selenium host to suppress the Na2Sex shuttling. Fe2O3 not only serves as an efficient Na2Sex reservoir via strong chemisorption between O atoms of Fe2O3 and Na atoms of Na2Sex, but also promotes the transformation of Na2Sex. Moreover, the plentiful oxygen vacancy defects in Fe2O3 phase increases the catalytic conversion efficiency of Na2Sex. Accordingly, the selenium-containing Fe2O3@NC exhibits a reversible capacity of 215.3 mAh g−1 after 2310 cycles at 10 A g−1 with a superior capacity retention of 97.1%. This work clarifies the unique chemical properties of metal oxides, especially analogs with plentiful O vacancies, in promoting the adsorption-conversion process of Na2Sex, which provides a practical way to achieve the design of highly stable Na-Se batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Recognizing the potential of K-salts, apart from KOH, for generating porous carbons using chemical activation","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Due to their high porosity, chemically activated porous carbons find extensive use in various applications including gas capture, energy storage, and environmental remediation. Such porous carbons are predominantly produced using KOH as a chemical activating agent, which is highly corrosive, toxic, and harmful to the environment. As an alternative, several other potassium-based salts including K2CO3, KHCO3, K3C6H5O7, KC2H3O2, K2C2O4, K2FeO4, and K2SO4 can also produce high porosity in the porous carbons via chemical activation with negligible detrimental effects on the environment. This review, which is the first of its kind, discusses the usefulness of various K-salts, other than KOH, in producing porous carbons with competitive results in terms of various physico-chemical features and their impact on various application fields. This review also discusses the methodology and mechanistic aspects of various K-salts for chemical activation. Up-to-date literature is reviewed for the above-mentioned purposes that would provide the readers with useful information on the evolution of various K-salts, other than KOH, for their usefulness and future potential in chemical activation to produce highly efficient porous carbons for various applications.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Well-dispersed cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated on ZIF-8-derived N-doped porous carbon as an excellent peroxymonosulfate activator for sulfamethoxazole degradation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The practical application of carbon materials supported cobalt (Co)-based heterogeneous materials as excellent peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activators has attracted wide attention in recent years because of their low particle self-agglomeration and low Co leaching. Herein, we developed a new synthetic strategy for designing Co nanoparticles (Co NPs)-encapsulated zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8-derived porous carbon (NC) (denoted as Co-N@NC-x) by calcinating NC with a polydopamine-chelating Co coating. It was demonstrated that NC could effectively prevent Co agglomeration because it provided rich load sites for Co. Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicated that the addition of Co could increase the surface defects of NC. Co-N@NC-90 (0.1 g/L) efficiently catalyzed PMS to degrade >96.91 % of sulfamethoxazole (SMX, 20 mg/L) within 90 min with an initial pH of 3.65–9.05 based on the synergistic effect between Co NPs and NC. It was demonstrated that Co NPs were the main active sites, and the defects and carbonyl (C[dbnd]O) group active sites also contributed to SMX degradation by catalyzing PMS. Graphitic N was an adsorption site for SMX. A singlet oxygen (1O2)-dominated non-radical mechanism has been proposed. Additionally, Co-N@NC-90 exhibited excellent stability resulting from NC encapsulation.

Simple and scalable gelatin-mediated synthesis of a novel iron sulfide/graphitic carbon nanoarchitecture for sustainable sodium-ion storage,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transition metal sulfide (TMS)-based sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are inherently different from traditional intercalation-based ones because of their ability to store more than one Na+ per transition metal ion via conversion reaction. Iron sulfide (FeS) is an attractive conversion electrode material with a high theoretical capacity. Apart from the extensive availability and cost-effectiveness, many issues deter the development of iron sulfide-based SIBs. Huge volume changes accompanied by polysulfide generation and dissolution with long-term electrochemical cycling of FeS result in tremendous deterioration in capacity. To resolve these complex concerns, we herein present the strategic design of a porous, three-dimensional (3D) interconnected network of carbon nanosheets consisting of well-confined FeS nanoparticles via a simple and scalable gelatin-mediated sol-gel method utilizing the coordination capability of carboxylic and amino acid groups in biomass precursor gelatin with Fe3+. While the in-situ generated nano FeS shortens the Na+ diffusion pathway, the heteroatom (N, S) doped graphitic carbon network improves the ion/electron transport, buffers the volume change in FeS, and simultaneously immobilizes the polysulfide species dissolved in ether electrolyte. The as-synthesized novel composite delivers a high specific capacity of 303.4 mAh g−1 after 1200 cycles at a high current rate of 10 A g−1, with a low capacity-decay rate of 0.029% per cycle, delivering stable, long-term sodium-ion storage. Additionally, a full sodium-ion battery assembled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode and this composite achieve a stable specific capacity of 347.9 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 with a capacity retention of ∼86.5% demonstrating the competence for practical applications.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Fluorophenyl methyl sulfone as an interface modifier for Ni-rich cathode materials of lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Nickel-rich lithium layered oxides are considered as the most addressing advanced cathode material for lithium-ion batteries, however, its low cycling performance at high temperature is considered the main bottleneck in expanding application areas. To improve poor surface stability of advanced cathode materials, fluorophenyl methyl sulfone is suggested as a surface modifier, which can make stable cathode-electrolyte interphases on the cathode via simple electrochemical oxidation. Electrochemical voltage spectroscopy indicates that the cell cycled with fluorophenyl methyl sulfone exhibits a higher amount of oxidation peaks corresponded to the formation of artificial interphases. In the cycling performance, the cell cycled with fluorophenyl methyl sulfone reveals improved cycling retention (81.7%) compared to that cycled with standard electrolyte (62.5%) at high temperature. Additional systematic analyses suggest that parasitic reaction associated with electrolyte decomposition is well suppressed in the cell controlled with fluorophenyl methyl sulfone because sulfone moiety of the additive participates to effective artificial interphases on the cathode.",Journal of Power Sources
Manipulating alloying reaction to achieve the stable and dendrite-free zinc metal anodes,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Zinc metal anode has serious dendrites and corrosion issues in the mild electrolyte, which greatly hinder the commercialization of aqueous zinc-ion batteries. Herein, zinc-amalgam (Zn3Hg) alloy anode has been prepared and displays a unique synergistic zinc plating/stripping and alloying/dealloying reaction mechanism. The ultrafast zinc ions diffusion in Zn3Hg and the alloying reaction of Zn3Hg with Zn ions effectively suppress the dendrites growth and skillfully address corrosion issues. Consequently, the Zn3Hg anode expresses long cycle life of 2000 h at 1 mA cm−2/1 mAh cm−2 and exhibits the lowest voltage hysteresis of only 8.0 mV that we know so far. Even at 5 mA cm−2/5 mAh cm−2 and 10 mA cm−2/10 mAh cm−2, the Zn3Hg anode also exhibits excellent cycling stability and low voltage hysteresis. Moreover, zinc ion capacitors composed of Zn3Hg anode and active carbon cathode still possess a specific capacity of 61 mAh/g after 5000 cycles at 1 A/g. The Zn3Hg anode enriches the varieties of zinc alloy anodes and provides a new development path for constructing stable and dendrite-free zinc metal anodes.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Ce(NO3)4: A dual-functional electrolyte additive for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries face enormous challenges in the coulombic efficiency, capacity retention, and rate performance, which are seriously related to the solid electrolyte interface film, the shuttle effect of polysulfide, and the sodium-sulfur reaction kinetics. Adjusting the electrolyte composition by additives can significantly improve the battery performance and is attracting tremendous attention. However, the reported additives mainly focus on one of the two electrodes. It is still a considerable challenge to balance both aspects. This work proposes a novel dual-functional additive, Ce(NO3)4, and studies its comprehensive influence on the battery performance by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electrochemical techniques. The results show that Ce(NO3)4 generates NaCeO2 and NaNO3 to deposit on the Na surface. This inert deposition layer inhibits the side reactions between Na and polysulfides and optimizes the Na dissolution/deposition process, thereby improving the cycle stability of the battery. In addition, Ce4+ has a strong adsorption effect on capturing and evenly depositing polysulfides on the S cathode to inhibit the shuttle effect. In short, the Ce(NO3)4 additive plays a dual function of protecting the Na anode and optimizing the S cathode reaction.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Integrating a three-dimensional Cu2MoS4 electrode and solid-state polymer electrolyte for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The improvement of solid-state batteries (SSBs) in terms of safety performance and energy density has an unusual significance for it to apply to power batteries, and the interface matching of solid-state electrolytes and adapted electrode materials has become the key. Due to poor electrode-electrolyte interface contact in SSBs which could result in low ionic conductivity, we designed a 3D integrated electrode constructed from a Cu2MoS4 electrode grown in situ on the surface of copper foam with a polymer-in-salt solid electrolyte based on PVDF-HFP. The ion clusters formed by NaPF6 near the PVDF-HFP network structure can effectively shorten the Na+ transport path, and then adding 1-(4-cyanophenyl)-guanidine can also provide more ion transport routes by forming coordination bonds. The polymer electrolyte exhibited excellent ionic conductivity (1.67×10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature) and electrochemical stability (5.6 V vs Na|Na+). At the same time, it showed excellent stability during the cycle performance test of the symmetrical batteries, compared with the liquid electrolytes, the polymer-in-salt solid electrolytes were not short circuit under the same test conditions, indicating that the polymer-in-salt solid electrolytes can effectively inhibit the growth of Na dendrites. This 3D integrated electrode exhibited excellent interface-contact compatibility, mechanical stability, and electrochemical performance closed to that of liquid electrolytes and even outperformed liquid electrolytes at a high rate cycle.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Accelerating ion transport via in-situ formation of built-in electric field for fast charging sodium-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Batteries with high storage capacity, durable cycle lifetime and fast charging are extremely rare but meaningful. Herein, the three-dimensional core–shell structure with tin dioxide coated barium titanate (BTO) and the outermost layer covered with phosphorus doped carbon (BTO@SnO2@P-C) is designed as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), which shows remarkable cycle tolerance and high-rate sodium storage capacity. It exhibits rapid kinetics at 10 A·g−1 with a powerful life of 10,000 cycles, just 1 min to charge 99%. Such advanced electrochemical performance is primarily attributed to the built-in electric field (BIEF) generated by the in-situ dynamic polarization of BTO from the battery's inherent electric field. Additionally, ensuring the piezoelectric potential through the core–shell structure intensifies the BIEF. The BIEF effectively accelerates sodium ions transport and greatly improves tin dioxide anode reaction kinetics and sodium storage capacity, which is of constructive significance for realizing SIBs with high energy density and fast charging capability.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Advanced energy storage performance based on a hairly hydrangea-like Co3-xMnxO4 with high absorption capacity,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Structural design and regulation of absorption capacity play important roles for improving energy storage performance of bimetallic oxides in supercapacitors (SCs). Herein, three-dimensional Co3-xMnxO4 (0 < x < 3) with different Co/Mn molar ratios are synthesized by hydrothermal method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrates the changes of the morphology of Co3-xMnxO4 (0 < x < 3) with different Co/Mn molar ratios, in which the Co3-xMnxO4 (x = 1.09) exhibits a hairly hydrangea-like morphology and thus provides a reduced contact resistance and an effective ion transition ability proved by the electrochemical measurements. Meanwhile, by theoretical calculations we prove that the addition of Mn adequately improves the absorption capacity of OH−on Co3-xMnxO4 and thereby boosts the reaction activity. Therefore, when the Co3-xMnxO4 (x = 1.09) is used as a SCs electrode, it performs a high specific capacitance of 326 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Moreover, an assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (Co3-xMnxO4(x = 1.09)@NF//AC@NF) demonstrates enhanced performances, such as an energy density of 17.77 Wh Kg−1 at a power density of 400 W Kg−1, an outstanding cycling stability with 83.3% retention over 10,000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1 and so on.

Obtaining Water from Air Using Porous Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs),"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Water collection from moisture in air, i.e., atmospheric water harvesting, is an urgent future need for society. It can be used for water production everywhere and anytime as an alternative water source in remote areas. However, water harvesting and collection usually relies on desalination, fog, and dewing harvesting, which are energy intensive. In this respect, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have broad applicability for water harvesting in water-scarce areas; therefore, the current discussion focuses on this approach. Furthermore, recent progress on MOFs for moisture harvesters is critically discussed. In addition, the design, operation, and water harvesting mechanisms of MOFs are studied. Finally, we discuss critical points for future research for the design of new MOFs as moisture harvesters for use in practical applications. Graphical Abstract: MOF adsorbents offer excellent operating capacity in various temperature and pressure ranges. Rational water harvesters can thus be developed by adjusting structural properties such as the porosity, functionalities, and metal centers, thereby enabling new devices to produce water even in remote areas.

Recent progress in the design of advanced MXene/metal oxides-hybrid materials for energy storage devices,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitride, also called MXenes, have emerged as an attractive platform for constructing functional materials with enhanced properties for various energy applications. Transition metal oxides (TMOs) nanostructures supported on MXene nanosheets based on van der Waals interactions are facile, highly efficient, and low-cost, with self-assemble properties that can easily control their packing density. The resulting TMOs/MXene nanocomposites perfectly integrate the advantages of both components. MXene nanosheets can serve as conductive substrates to grow TMOs nanostructures which can facilitate fast electron and ion transport to prevent aggregation of TMOs nanostructures in energy applications. In turn, the TMOs nanostructures act as spacers to isolate the MXene nanosheets and prevent their re-stacking during assembly, enriching interfacial contacts and preserving the active sites. In this review, the recent advances of MXene/TMOs-based nanocomposites with enhanced performance for energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors (SCs), metal-ion hybrid capacitors (MIHCs), and various kinds of rechargeable batteries (RBs), are summarized and highlighted. We briefly discuss the synthesis methods, properties of MXenes, and the structural engineering of MXenes by introducing functionalized TMOs to achieve high-performance energy storage devices, such as in SCs, MIHCs, and RBs. Special attention is also given to MXene/TMOs nanocomposites-based SCs, HCs, metal-ion batteries, and metal-air/sulfur batteries.

Charge self-regulation in 1T'''-MoS2 structure with rich S vacancies for enhanced hydrogen evolution activity,"© 2022, The Author(s).Active electronic states in transition metal dichalcogenides are able to prompt hydrogen evolution by improving hydrogen absorption. However, the development of thermodynamically stable hexagonal 2H-MoS2 as hydrogen evolution catalyst is likely to be shadowed by its limited active electronic state. Herein, the charge self-regulation effect mediated by tuning Mo−Mo bonds and S vacancies is revealed in metastable trigonal MoS2 (1T'''-MoS2) structure, which is favarable for the generation of active electronic states to boost the hydrogen evolution reaction activity. The optimal 1T'''-MoS2 sample exhibits a low overpotential of 158 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 74.5 mV dec−1 in acidic conditions, which are far exceeding the 2H-MoS2 counterpart (369 mV and 137 mV dec−1). Theoretical modeling indicates that the boosted performance is attributed to the formation of massive active electronic states induced by the charge self-regulation effect of Mo−Mo bonds in defective 1T'''-MoS2 with rich S vacancies.",Nature Communications
"Coupling modification of Fermi level, band flattening and lattice defects to approach outstanding thermoelectric performance of ZnO films via tuning In and Ga incorporation","© 2022 Acta Materialia Inc.Band structure modification is found one of the state-of-the-art strategies to control electrical, thermal transport properties, and optimize performance of thermoelectric (TE) materials. Despite being a high-temperature n-type TE material, low-dimensional ZnO structures, specifically thin films normally possess a poor performance due to instability, low electrical, and high thermal conductivities. Herein, it is found that the trade-offs between TE parameters of ZnO films can be simultaneously abated by co-doping In and Ga. The dual incorporation of In and Ga enhances crystallinity, thermal stability, and TE properties up to 573 K. Tuning In and Ga contents not only optimizes carrier concentration associating with Fermi level modification, but also engineers lattice defects contributing to scattering transport mechanisms. Furthermore, the In3+ compensation at substitutional sites, specifically at high temperature, significantly increases density-of-state effective mass due to conduction band flattening. As a result, the coupling modification of Fermi level, band flattening, and lattice defects leads to maintaining electrical conductivity at a medium degree, increasing Seebeck coefficient, and decreasing thermal conductivity, respectively. The TE dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) and power factor (PF) of the films deposited from the In0.01Ga0.04Zn99.95O compound significantly boost to 0.2 and 745.2 µW/mK2 at 573 K, respectively. These values are 1328 and 536% higher than pristine ZnO film; 400 and 258% greater than Ga single-doped ZnO film, respectively. It proposes that our ZnO-based thin films approach the high ZT region (ZT ≥ 0.2) of advanced nanostructured ZnO-based bulks.",Acta Materialia

The emergence of unconventional electrochemical energy storage devices, including hybrid batteries, hybrid redox flow cells and bacterial batteries, is part of the solution. These alternative electrochemical cell configurations provide materials and operating condition flexibility while offering high-energy conversion efficiency and modularity of design-to-design devices. The power of these diverse devices ranges from a few milliwatts to several megawatts. Manufacturing durable electronic and point-of-care devices is possible due to the development of all-solid-state batteries with efficient electrodes for long cycling and high energy density. New batteries made of earth-abundant metal ions are approaching the capacity of lithium-ion batteries. Costs are being reduced with the advent of flow batteries with engineered redox molecules for high energy density and membrane-free power generating electrochemical cells, which utilize liquid dynamics and interfaces (solid, liquid, and gaseous) for electrolyte separation. These batteries support electrode regeneration strategies for chemical and bio-batteries reducing battery energy costs. Other batteries have different benefits, e.g., carbon-neutral Li-CO2 batteries consume CO2 and generate power, offering dual-purpose energy storage and carbon sequestration. This work considers the recent technological advances of energy storage devices. Their transition from conventional to unconventional battery designs is examined to identify operational flexibilities, overall energy storage/conversion efficiency and application compatibility. Finally, a list of facilities for large-scale deployment of major electrochemical energy storage routes is provided.

Elastic Buffering Layer on CuS Enabling High-Rate and Long-Life Sodium-Ion Storage,"© 2022, The Author(s).The latest view suggests the inactive core, surface pulverization, and polysulfide shuttling effect of metal sulfides are responsible for their low capacity and poor cycling performance in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Whereas overcoming the above problems based on conventional nanoengineering is not efficient enough. In this work, erythrocyte-like CuS microspheres with an elastic buffering layer of ultrathin polyaniline (PANI) were synthesized through one-step self-assembly growth, followed by in situ polymerization of aniline. When CuS@PANI is used as anode electrode in SIBs, it delivers high capacity, ultrahigh rate capability (500 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and 214.5 mAh g−1 at 40 A g−1), and superior cycling life of over 7500 cycles at 20 A g−1. A series of in/ex situ characterization techniques were applied to investigate the structural evolution and sodium-ion storage mechanism. The PANI swollen with electrolyte can stabilize solid electrolyte interface layer, benefit the ion transport/charge transfer at the PANI/electrolyte interface, and restrain the size growth of Cu particles in confined space. Moreover, finite element analyses and density functional simulations confirm that the PANI film effectively buffers the volume expansion, suppresses the surface pulverization, and traps the polysulfide.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
First-principles calculations study of TiS2/Ti2CS2 heterostructure as an anode material for Li/Na/K-ion batteries,"© 2022TiS2 and Ti2CS2 are two potential candidates as anode materials for rechargeable ion batteries. However, the issues of semiconductor property and re-stacking prevent their development. In this work, we assembled a van der Waals heterostructure of TiS2/Ti2CS2 and investigated its possibility as an anode material for Li/Na/K-ion batteries (LIBs/NIBs/KIBs) by first-principles calculations. The results show that the TiS2/Ti2CS2 has excellent stability and metallic nature. The Li, Na and K ions exhibit extremely low diffusion barriers (below 0.4 eV) in the TiS2/Ti2CS2 interlayer, which predicts that it has remarkable rate performance. For NIBs and KIBs, the average open circuit voltages (0.626 V and 0.995 V) of TiS2/Ti2CS2 are in the range of 0–1 V and the theoretical specific capacities (566 mA·h/g and 283 mA·h/g) are higher than those (35 mA·h/g and 279 mA·h/g) of graphite anode for the corresponding batteries. All of this indicate that the TiS2/Ti2CS2 is well suited as an anode material for NIBs and KIBs. Our study may provide guidance and new ideas for the theoretical and experimental design of new anode materials for metal-ion batteries.",Computational Materials Science
Reversible phosphorus-based five-electron transfer reaction for aluminium–phosphorus batteries,"© 2022The use of multi-electron redox materials has been proved as an effective strategy to increase the energy density of batteries. Herein, we report a new reversible phosphorus-based five-electron transfer reaction (P(0) ⇆ P(+5)) in chloroaluminate ionic liquids (CAM-ILs), which represents a new reaction mechanism offering one of the theoretically highest specific capacities of 4325 mAh g−1 among all secondary batteries. Theoretical calculations further confirm the phosphorus electrochemical oxidation pathway with a potential oxidation voltage of ∼2.0 V. Detailed characterisation reveals fresh insight of the role of CAM-ILs, which can catalyze the electrochemical oxidation process of phosphorus by forming electron-enriched state of phosphorus. As a result, a conceptual aluminium-phosphorus battery was assembled, which deliver a high performance of 1512 mAh g−1 and 1176 Wh kg−1, outperforming many similar metal ion battery chemistry. This study sheds light on phosphorus oxidation process in CAM-ILs and presents a new pathway using non-metallic element based multi-electron oxidation to achieve high performance batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Design of spherical TiN/Nb4N5 heterostructure as bifunctional adsorption/catalytic material for lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLithium sulfur (Li-S) battery is the typical representative of the new generation secondary batteries, but its practical application is greatly hindered by the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics. In this work, a spherical TiN/Nb4N5 heterostructure is produced by nitridation of TiNb2O7 microsphere and then used as an adsorption and catalytic material to fabricate modified polypropylene separator in Li-S batteries. Visual adsorption tests show that the TiN/Nb4N5 heterostructure has better adsorption capacity of LiPSs than that of TiNb2O7 microsphere precursor. The TiN/Nb4N5 heterostructure also exhibits superior catalytic performance to accelerate the redox reaction kinetics of LiPSs conversion. The Li-S cell assembled with TiN/Nb4N5 modified separator can deliver an initial discharge capacity of 917 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, and a reversible capacity of 663.2 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles, higher than the cell assembled with TiNb2O7 modified separator (555.4 mAh g−1) and pristine separator (385.1 mAh g−1). In short, this work provides a simple synthetic method to obtain a TiN/Nb4N5 heterostructure with enhanced electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.",Materials Today Communications
Highly active CoP-Co2N confined in nanocarbon enabling efficient electrocatalytic immobilizing-conversion of polysulfide targeting high-rate lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesLithium-sulfur batteries suffer from poor cycling stability because of the intrinsic shuttling effect of intermediate polysulfides and sluggish reaction kinetics, especially at high rates and high sulfur loading. Herein, we report the construction of a CoP-Co2N@N-doped carbon polyhedron uniformly anchored on three-dimensional carbon nanotubes/graphene (CoP-Co2N@NC/CG) scaffold as a sulfur reservoir to achieve the trapping-diffusion-conversion of polysulfides. Highly active CoP-Co2N shows marvelous catalytic effects by effectively accelerating the reduction of sulfur and the oxidation of Li2S during the discharging and charging process, respectively, while the conductive NC/CG network with massive mesoporous channels ensures fast and continuous long-distance electron/ion transportation. DFT calculations demonstrate that the CoP-Co2N with excellent intrinsic conductivity serves as job-synergistic immobilizing-conversion sites for polysulfides through the formation of P···Li/N···Li and Co···S bonds. As a result, the S@CoP-Co2N@NC/CG cathode (sulfur content 1.7 mg cm−2) exhibits a high capacity of 988 mAh g−1 at 2 C after 500 cycles, which is superior to most of the electrochemical performance reported. Even under high sulfur content (4.3 mg cm−2), it also shows excellent cyclability with high capacity at 1 C.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Simultaneous interface passivation and defect compensation for high-efficiency planar perovskite solar cells,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Interfacial defects at the electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite interface significantly impact the interface carrier dynamics and thus the performance of planar perovskite solar cells. Here, a synergistic strategy has been proposed to compensate for oxygen vacancies and halogen vacancies at the ETL/perovskite interface by constructing a Na2S interface layer. The results show that the S atoms simultaneously bond with the Sn atoms in SnO2 and occupy the halogen vacancies in the perovskite and form a Pb-S-Sn conductive channel, which accelerates carrier extraction at the interface. In addition, the Na2S interface layer affects the growth of the perovskite film and passivates the grain boundaries, resulting in reduced defect density and increased grain size. Correspondingly, the target device achieves a significantly improved efficiency (21.2 %) compared to the pristine device (17.2 %) and maintains over 86 % of the initial efficiency after aging in the air for 1000 h with 35 % RH; while exhibiting improved humidity and thermal stability. The interface defect compensation strategy reported herein provides a simple and effective method for interface optimization to further improve device performance.",Applied Surface Science
Codoped porous carbon nanofibres as a potassium metal host for nonaqueous K-ion batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s).Potassium metal is an appealing alternative to lithium as an alkali metal anode for future electrochemical energy storage systems. However, the use of potassium metal is hindered by the growth of unfavourable deposition (e.g., dendrites) and volume changes upon cycling. To circumvent these issues, we propose the synthesis and application of nitrogen and zinc codoped porous carbon nanofibres that act as potassium metal hosts. This carbonaceous porous material enables rapid potassium infusion (e.g., < 1 s cm−2) with a high potassium content (e.g., 97 wt. %) and low potassium nucleation overpotential (e.g., 15 mV at 0.5 mA cm−2). Experimental and theoretical measurements and analyses demonstrate that the carbon nanofibres induce uniform potassium deposition within its porous network and facilitate a dendrite-free morphology during asymmetric and symmetric cell cycling. Interestingly, when the potassium-infused carbon material is tested as an active negative electrode material in combination with a sulfur-based positive electrode and a nonaqueous electrolyte solution in the coin cell configuration, an average discharge voltage of approximately 1.6 V and a discharge capacity of approximately 470 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at 500 mA g−1 and 25 °C are achieved.",Nature Communications
Enhanced ion transport kinetics and sodiophilicity for Na metal batteries enabled by VPO4,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdNa metal is an attractive anode for rechargeable batteries. However, uneven nucleation and deposition may cause dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase formation, leading to inferior cycle performance and serious security risks. Herein, we report a stable polyanion-structure of VPO4 with superior transport kinetics for Na metal anodes. The initial sodiation via a solid-solution reaction can retain the stable structure with fast ion transport and enhance the affinity to adsorb Na on the surface of sodiophilic VPO4 skeleton. A reversible cycling behavior of Na metal anode with VPO4 is achieved with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.63% over 500 cycles. Our study suggests a new direction for constructing sodium metal electrodes via enhancing the internal ion transport kinetics and sodiophilicity to homogeneous Na deposition.",Materials Today Chemistry
An extraordinary Na-S battery enabled by a carbon nanosheet host loaded with Fe-accelerator and TiO2-inhibitor,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The inexpensive room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery has attracted extensive attention due to its various potential application but is still suffering from the low utilization of sulfur, the shuttle effect and the sluggish reaction activity of sodium polysulfides (SPSs). In this work, a TiO2/sulfur/atomic-iron loaded carbon nanosheet cathode is designed for high performance RT Na-S battery. When the atomic iron exists, a much higher electrochemical activity of sulfur was obtained, indicating the atomic iron can accelerate the conversion of SPSs. Furthermore, the TiO2 layer can inhibit the shuttle effect of SPSs and the side-reaction between the intermediates and carbonate electrolyte. As a result, the constructed sulfur cathode exhibits a high reversible capacity (569.9 mAh g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of 57.57%) at 0.1 A g−1 and outstanding cycling performance (507 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles). This work provides a new strategy for preparing high performance cathode materials for RT Na-S battery.",Applied Surface Science
Ag sputtering–assisted phase formation of Ag2S-decorated ZnS composite sheets and their photoactive performances,"© 2022 The American Ceramic Society.The Ag2S crystallites–decorated ZnS composite sheets were synthesized by combinational methodology. Two types of ZnS sheet templates were obtained through the vulcanization of ZnO sheets with sulfur precursors of thiourea and Na2S, and then ZnS–Ag2S heterogeneous sheets were obtained with sputtering Ag crystallites and post-annealing procedures. The ZnS sheets have rugged and smooth surfaces formed with sulfur precursors of thiourea and Na2S, respectively. Both the initial microstructures of ZnS sheet templates and Ag2S decoration content affect the photoactivity of the ZnS–Ag2S composite sheets. Compared with the pristine ZnS, the ZnS–Ag2S composite sheets with a suitable Ag2S loading content (Ag at% = 3.6–3.8) are beneficial to improve the photoactivity, which could be explained by the combination of narrow bandgap; Ag2S crystallites would enhance photon absorption and separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers. The scavenger tests and photodegradation mechanism show that hydroxyl radicals and holes were the main active species for the ZnS–Ag2S composite sheets to photodegrade methyl orange solution. The experimental results herein provide a novel synthesis approach to decorate Ag2S crystallites onto ZnS with tunable contents and present important design guidelines for the resultant ZnS–Ag2S composite sheets to demonstrate marked improvement in photoactivity.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society
Commercially Viable Hybrid Li-Ion/Metal Batteries with High Energy Density Realized by Symbiotic Anode and Prelithiated Cathode,"© 2022, The Author(s).The energy density of commercial lithium (Li) ion batteries with graphite anode is reaching the limit. It is believed that directly utilizing Li metal as anode without a host could enhance the battery’s energy density to the maximum extent. However, the poor reversibility and infinite volume change of Li metal hinder the realistic implementation of Li metal in battery community. Herein, a commercially viable hybrid Li-ion/metal battery is realized by a coordinated strategy of symbiotic anode and prelithiated cathode. To be specific, a scalable template-removal method is developed to fabricate the porous graphite layer (PGL), which acts as a symbiotic host for Li ion intercalation and subsequent Li metal deposition due to the enhanced lithiophilicity and sufficient ion-conducting pathways. A continuous dissolution-deintercalation mechanism during delithiation process further ensures the elimination of dead Li. As a result, when the excess plating Li reaches 30%, the PGL could deliver an ultrahigh average Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% for 180 cycles with a capacity of 2.48 mAh cm−2 in traditional carbonate electrolyte. Meanwhile, an air-stable recrystallized lithium oxalate with high specific capacity (514.3 mAh g−1) and moderate operating potential (4.7–5.0 V) is introduced as a sacrificial cathode to compensate the initial loss and provide Li source for subsequent cycles. Based on the prelithiated cathode and initial Li-free symbiotic anode, under a practical-level 3 mAh capacity, the assembled hybrid Li-ion/metal full cell with a P/N ratio (capacity ratio of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 to graphite) of 1.3 exhibits significantly improved capacity retention after 300 cycles, indicating its great potential for high-energy-density Li batteries.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
An electrochemically stable homogeneous glassy electrolyte formed at room temperature for all-solid-state sodium batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s).All-solid-state sodium batteries (ASSSBs) are promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage. However, there are no commercialized ASSSBs yet, in part due to the lack of a low-cost, simple-to-fabricate solid electrolyte (SE) with electrochemical stability towards Na metal. In this work, we report a family of oxysulfide glass SEs (Na3PS4−xOx, where 0 < x ≤ 0.60) that not only exhibit the highest critical current density among all Na-ion conducting sulfide-based SEs, but also enable high-performance ambient-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. By forming bridging oxygen units, the Na3PS4−xOx SEs undergo pressure-induced sintering at room temperature, resulting in a fully homogeneous glass structure with robust mechanical properties. Furthermore, the self-passivating solid electrolyte interphase at the Na|SE interface is critical for interface stabilization and reversible Na plating and stripping. The new structural and compositional design strategies presented here provide a new paradigm in the development of safe, low-cost, energy-dense, and long-lifetime ASSSBs.",Nature Communications
Hydroxyl radical induced from hydrogen peroxide by cobalt manganese oxides for ciprofloxacin degradation,"© 2022Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are promising technology to remove organic pollutant in water. However, the main problem in the AOPs is the low generation of hydroxyl radical (•OH) owing to the low decomposition efficiency of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, the spinel type cobalt acid manganese (MnCo2O4) with flower morphology was fabricated through a co-precipitation method. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms that the MnCo2O4 with the optimal molar ratio of Co and Mn precursors (CM3, Co:Mn = 3) has more Lewis acid sites compared with single metal oxide catalysts (Co3O4 and Mn2O3), leading to the excellent performances for H2O2 decomposition rate constant on CM3, which is about 15.03 and 4.21 times higher than those of Co3O4 and Mn2O3, respectively. As a result, the obtained CM3 shows a higher ciprofloxacin degradation ratio than that of Co3O4 and Mn2O3. Furthermore, CM3 shows an excellent stability during several cycles. This work proposes effective catalysts for ciprofloxacin decomposition and provides feasible route for treating practical environmental problems.",Chinese Chemical Letters

In this regard, polysulfide-air redox flow batteries demonstrated great potential. However, the crossover of polysulfide is one significant challenge. Here, we report a stable and cost-effective alkaline-based hybrid polysulfide-air redox flow battery where a dual-membrane-structured flow cell design mitigates the sulfur crossover issue. Moreover, combining manganese/carbon catalysed air electrodes with sulfidised Ni foam polysulfide electrodes, the redox flow battery achieves a maximum power density of 5.8 mW cm−2 at 50% state of charge and 55 °C. An average round-trip energy efficiency of 40% is also achieved over 80 cycles at 1 mA cm−2. Based on the performance reported, techno-economic analyses suggested that energy and power costs of about 2.5 US$/kWh and 1600 US$/kW, respectively, has be achieved for this type of alkaline polysulfide-air redox flow battery, with significant scope for further reduction.",Nature Communications
Highly efficient and selective electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production on Co-O-C active centers on graphene oxide,"© 2022, The Author(s).Electrochemical oxygen reduction provides an eco-friendly synthetic route to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a widely used green chemical. However, the kinetically sluggish and low-selectivity oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key challenge to electrochemical production of H2O2 for practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate that single cobalt atoms anchored on oxygen functionalized graphene oxide form Co-O-C@GO active centres (abbreviated as Co1@GO for simplicity) that act as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for H2O2 production. This Co1@GO electrocatalyst shows excellent electrochemical performance in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH, exhibiting high reactivity with an onset potential of 0.91 V and H2O2 production of 1.0 mg cm−2 h−1 while affording high selectivity of 81.4% for H2O2. Our combined experimental observations and theoretical calculations indicate that the high reactivity and selectivity of Co1@GO for H2O2 electrogeneration arises from a synergistic effect between the O-bonded single Co atoms and adjacent oxygen functional groups (C-O bonds) of the GO present in the Co-O-C active centres.",Communications Chemistry
Electrochemical cell recharging by solvent separation and transfer processes,"© 2022, The Author(s).Electrochemical conversion and storage of unutilized renewable energy will contribute to decarbonization. Here, we create the concept of a liquid electrochemical cell that discharges between the anodic and cathodic sides by reverse reactions of the same redox couple in different solvation states, which are created by differences in the mixture ratios of two solvents called the main solvent (MS) and the transferred solvent (TS). The cell can be charged by a transfer of the TS between the discharged anolyte and catholyte. As an example, we demonstrate a cell utilizing a ferro-/ferricyanide redox couple. Stable discharging and charging via the proposed method is achieved by utilizing water (MS) and acetone (TS). Additionally, dominating factors in the design of a high-performance system are discussed, focusing on the electron acceptability of the MS and the TS. The cell voltages are successfully tuned, and a cell voltage of 0.63 V is achieved by the combination of dimethyl sulfoxide (MS) and water (TS). Moreover, the cell can be customized by various electrochemical reaction systems, which can allow multiple options for the charging processes. This concept provides new approaches for the utilization of diverse energy sources as an input for the charging of electrochemical cells.",Scientific Reports

Abstract: Carbon- and silica-based nanomaterials possess a set of merits including large surface area, good structural stability, diversified morphology, adjustable structure, and biocompatibility. These outstanding features make them widely applied in different fields. However, limited by the surface free energy effect, the current studies mainly focus on the symmetric structures, such as nanospheres, nanoflowers, nanowires, nanosheets, and core–shell structured composites. By comparison, the asymmetric structure with ingenious adjustability not only exhibits a larger effective surface area accompanied with more active sites, but also enables each component to work independently or corporately to harness their own merits, thus showing the unusual performances in some specific applications. The current review mainly focuses on the recent progress of design principles and synthesis methods of asymmetric carbon- and silica-based nanomaterials, and their applications in energy storage, catalysis, and biomedicine.

Furthermore, the challenges and development prospects on the synthesis and applications of asymmetric carbon- and silica-based nanomaterials are also presented and highlighted.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
Observation of ionic conductivity on PUA-TBAI-I2 gel polymer electrolyte,"© 2022, The Author(s).Jatropha oil-based polyurethane acylate gel polymer electrolyte was mixed with different concentrations of tetrabutylammonium iodide salt (TBAI). The temperature dependences of ionic conductivity, dielectric modulus and relaxation time were studied in the range of 298 to 393 K. The highest ionic conductivity of (1.88 ± 0.020) × 10–4 Scm−1 at 298 K was achieved when the gel contained 30 wt% of TBAI and 2.06 wt% of I2. Furthermore, the study found that conductivity-temperature dependence followed the Vogel-Tammann Fulcher equation. From that, it could be clearly observed that 30 wt% TBAI indicated the lowest activation energy of 6.947 kJ mol−1. By using the fitting method on the Nyquist plot, the number density, mobility and diffusion coefficient of the charge carrier were determined. The charge properties were analysed using the dielectric permittivity, modulus and dissipation factor. Apart from this, the stoke drag and capacitance were determined.",Scientific Reports
Fabricating Na/In/C Composite Anode with Natrophilic Na–In Alloy Enables Superior Na Ion Deposition in the EC/PC Electrolyte,"© 2021, The Author(s).In conventional ethylene carbonate (EC)/propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte, sodium metal reacts spontaneously and deleteriously with solvent molecules. This significantly limits the practical feasibility of high-voltage sodium metal batteries based on Na metal chemistry. Herein, we present a sodium metal alloy strategy via introducing NaIn and Na2In phases in a Na/In/C composite, aiming at boosting Na ion deposition stability in the common EC/PC electrolyte. Symmetric cells with Na/In/C electrodes achieve an impressive long-term cycling capability at 1 mA cm−2 (> 870 h) and 5 mA cm−2 (> 560 h), respectively, with a capacity of 1 mAh cm−2. In situ optical microscopy clearly unravels a stable Na ion dynamic deposition process on the Na/In/C composite electrode surface, attributing to a dendrite-free and smooth morphology. Furthermore, theoretical simulations reveal intrinsic mechanism for the reversible Na ion deposition behavior with the composite Na/In/C electrode. Upon pairing with a high-voltage NaVPOF cathode, Na/In/C anode illustrates a better suitability in SMBs. This work promises an alternative alloying strategy for enhancing Na metal interfacial stability in the common EC/PC electrolyte for their future applications.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
"Optimal hydrogen carrier: Holistic evaluation of hydrogen storage and transportation concepts for power generation, aviation, and transportation","© 2022The storage of excess electrical generation, enabled through the electrolytic production of hydrogen from water, would allow “load-shifting” of power generation. This paves the way for hydrogen as an energy carrier to be further used as a zero‑carbon fuel for land, air, and sea transportation. However, challenges in hydrogen storage and transportation ultimately pose restrictions on its wider adaption along horizontal and vertical vectors. This paper investigates chemical energy carriers ranging from small molecules such as ammonia and methane to formic acid as well as other more complex hydrocarbons in response to this timely engineering problem. The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of such carrier molecules require energy lowering the effective net heating value of hydrogen up to 32 %. Different carrier approaches are discussed in the light of availability, energetics, water requirements, and suitability for applications in power generation, shipping, trucking, and aviation, supplemented by a comprehensive safety review making this study unique in its field. It is found that hydrogen delivered without a carrier is ideal for power generation applications due to the large quantities required. Aviation would benefit from either ammonia or hydrogen and is generally a field challenging to decarbonize. Ammonia appears also to be a good medium for shipping hydrogen between continents and to power container ships due to its high energy density and lower liquid temperature compared with hydrogen. At the same time, ammonia can also be used to power the ship's engine. Long-haul trucking would benefit the most from cryogenic or compressed hydrogen due to the lower quantities required and purity requirements of the fuel cells.",Journal of Energy Storage
Quantum capacitance of vacancy-defected and co-doped stanene for supercapacitor electrodes: A theoretical study,"© 2022The current study employs density functional theory (DFT) for systematic verification of the impact of vacancy, single-doping, and co-doping of light element atoms (B, N, Al, Si, P, S) and transition metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni) in stanene on the geometric, electronic structures, and quantum capacitance. The results suggested that the vacancy and doping both enlarged the quantum capacitance (CQ) of stanene, and co-doping was more effectively than that of single-doping. According to the electron density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, it was found that the improvement of CQ was attributed to the dopants and Sn-atoms located at vacancy. Moreover, the stanene structures by co-doping have performance of quantum capacitance at positive potential was at a disadvantage to that of negative bias. It was hoped that the results could give new ideas for the enhancement of the CQ of stanene-based supercapacitors.",Electrochimica Acta
The balanced improvement of electrochemical performance of cobalt disulfide anode material for sodium-ion batteries by constructing reduced graphene oxide conductive network based on “bucket principle”,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Recently, cobalt disulfide (CoS2) as a promising candidate of anode material for sodium ion batteries is paid much attention because of the high theoretical capacity. However, the poor rate capability and cycling stability are still the barriers to the large-scale application of CoS2 resulting from its low intrinsic electronic conductivity and severe volume change during the sodiation and desodiation process. In order to address above issues, herein, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is introduced to define the CoS2 nanoparticles growth in the solvothermal synthesis process and construct the three-dimensional conductive network, which can tune the electronic conductivity, ionic diffusivity and inhibiting effect of volume change of CoS2/rGO composites anode material. It is found that these factors show different trends accompanying with the increase of rGO doping amount. The compact rGO network is beneficial to improve the electronic conductivity and hinder the volume change of the composites, however, it maybe does harm to the fast sodium ion diffusion. And when it becomes sparse, the opposite is true. Hence, a balanced strategy based on “bucket principle” is proposed to achieve the balanced enhancement of the rate capability and cycling performance. The optimized CoS2/rGO electrode acquires a superior performance, possessing 675.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 471.1 mAh g−1 at 2.0 A g−1 with the capacity retention of 69.7%, and it still has 272.5 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1.0 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V. This can be attributed to the improvement of charge transfer process and the excellent accommodating capacity of volume change provided by rGO conductive network. This balanced strategy can also be used to synthesize high-performance composite materials in other fields.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Unraveling structure evolution failure mechanism in MoS2 anode for improving lithium storage stability,"© 20222H phase molybdenum disulfide (2H-MoS2) possesses the two-dimensional layered structure and high theoretical capacity, presenting excellent lithiation-delithiation property. However, the violent capacity decay within dozens of cycles still remains a great challenge due to lacking of in-depth failure mechanism. Herein, a novel decay-recovery-decay failure phenomenon upon long-term cycles is reported for the first time, which originates from the slow size change of Mo nanoparticles (NPs). Decay stages are triggered by many irregular-shaped Mo NPs with the increasing size up to ∼15 nm, leading to prominent pseudocapacitance failure and capacity loss. Subsequent recovery stages are attributed to the pulverization of coarse Mo NPs through surface sulfurization and accompanying lithiation. To overcome the instability issue, proper modifiers should be introduced to restrain the spontaneous growth of Mo NPs, such as aluminum oxide (Al2O3). The strong Mo-Al2O3 bond gradually “drags” Al2O3 fragments into the active material as the cycle continuously proceeds, resulting in the efficient refinement and the reversible conversion between Mo and MoS2. Therefore, the enhanced cycling stability and the capacity retention are successfully achieved. It is expected to provide a new insight into the energy storage of transition metal chalcogenide anode materials in rechargeable batteries.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
Nickel nanoparticles embedded N-doped mesoporous graphitized carbon nanoflake as multifunctional sulfur host for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries has long been obstructed by the critical problems of the lithium polysulfides shuttle effect and the intrinsically sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. In this study, nickel nanoparticles were embedded in N-doped mesoporous graphitized carbon nanoflakes (Ni-NMC) through the pyrolysis of polydopamine-coated nickel flakes followed by an acidic etching process. Homogeneous mesopores and highly graphitized carbon are formed by the thermal aggregation and catalytic effect of the nickel nanoparticles during the high-temperature pyrolysis. The nickel nanoparticles remain embedded in the substrate after the acidic etching process due to the protection provided by the carbon layer. The obtained Ni-NMC consists of ca. 3-nm thickness nanoflake, with a high specific surface area of 812.2 m2 g–1, a pore volume of 1.59 cm3 g–1, and a pore size distribution of 6–8 nm. When used as a multifunctional sulfur host, the as-synthesized Ni-NMC, due to its mesoporous and thin-flake architecture, high conductivity, and catalytic effect, is simultaneously able to confine sulfur species within the carbon host and bidirectionally promote the conversion of sulfur to the final lithium sulfide. As a result, a high-performance Li-S battery with a reversible capacity of 869 mA h g–1 at 0.2 C after 100 cycles and a remarkable specific capacity of 705 mA h g–1 at 1.0 C after 200 cycles with a decay rate of 0.05 % per cycle, was realized.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

One of the biggest deterrents during the practical application of Li-S batteries is the shuttle effect which causes fast capacity degradation and poor rate performance. 3D CoNi2S4 with 3D interconnected porous nitrogen doping carbon was prepared by sulfurizing the precursor Prussian blue analogues. The CoNi2S4 nanoparticles are confined in the carbon framework, affording interconnected macro-mesoporous channels. The constructed 3D CoNi2S4 modified separator effectively accommodates enough electrolytes and provides more exposed active sites that suppress the shuttle effect through trapping polysulfides and accelerating the lithiation of S8 to Li2S. Thus, Li-S batteries with 3D CoNi2S4-PP separators exhibit high-rate capacity and remarkable cycle stability. Furthermore, based on the modified separators, a high sulfur loading cathode delivers an areal capacity of 5.62 mAh cm−2. The separator size expands further to assemble the 1Ah Li-S pouch cell, confirming the practicality. This work provides an efficient strategy with a modified separator for high-performance Li-S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Room-temperature MXene-derived Ti3+ and rich oxygen vacancies in carbon-doped amorphous TiOx nanosheets for enhanced photocatalytic activity,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Exploring efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic degradation is of considerable importance for the long-term mitigation of environmental stress. Although defect engineering is an effective strategy to alter the electronic transport properties and light absorption capacity of TiO2, the synthesis of TiO2 rich in oxygen vacancies (OVs) via a green process at room temperature and with low energy consumption remains a challenge. Herein, amorphous TiO2 nanosheets rich in OVs were prepared by H2O2-assisted room-temperature oxidation of Ti3C2Tx MXene via a bottom-up approach. Notably, small amounts of C and Ti3+ were introduced during the preparation of carbon-doped TiO2 (C-TiOx), which was shown to possess abundant surface functional groups (e.g., –OH, –O, and –F) and two intermediate levels in its bandgap. Comparative experiments demonstrated that OVs play a key role in suppressing the recombination of photogenerated carriers and expanding the light absorption range of the photocatalyst. The unique quasi-two-dimensional structure of C-TiOx features a large number of exposed active sites, which are beneficial for improving its catalytic performance. Tetracycline (TC) was removed from the aqueous solution by the prepared photocatalysts C-TiOx and annealed-TiO2, and the former adsorbed 41.1% of TC. The TC removal efficiency of C-TiOx was 76%, which was higher than that of annealed-TiO2. This approach embodies a new strategy for introducing defects and doping in TiO2. Moreover, it is also thought that C-TiOx possesses promising characteristics suitable for a wide range of potential future applications.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide fabricated on TiO2/C nanofiber arrays as free standing electrode for high performance supercapacitors,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as electrode materials have recently received intense interests. However, the low conductivity, sluggish charge transfer kinetics and poor electrolyte penetration restrict the capacitive performance and hinder their practical applications. Herein, the Ni-Co-LDH nanosheets were introduced to the core/shell structured TiO2/C nanofiber arrays (TiO2/C NFAs) to construct a free-standing composite electrode for supercapacitor through a one-step electrodeposition method. The best-performing Ni1Co1-LDH/TiO2/C NFAs electrode exhibits high specific capacitance (1717.8 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2), remarkable rate capability with 75.1 % retention when the current density increased from 1 mA cm−2 to 75 mA cm−2, and excellent cycling stability (84.1 % of the original capacitance after 5000 cycles at 78.1 A g−1), surpassing most of the Ni-Co-LDH electrodes reported before. This excellent performance owes to the high conductivity of TiO2/C NFAs which can endow the low ohmic resistance and high diffusion coefficient of Ni-Co-LDH which may alleviate the structure degradation. Meanwhile, the Ni-Co-LDH with the optimized Ni/Co ratio of 1:1 can provide proper particle size of LDH nanosheets, small charge transfer resistance (Rct), and high stability of Ni-Co-LDH to resist the structure degradation in the long-term cycling process.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Cobalt nitride nanocrystals coated separator as multifunctional interlayer for improving polysulfides regulation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Using transition metal oxides to inhibit the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides is one of the effective ways to improve the cycling capacity of Li–S batteries. However, due to their unsatisfactory electrical conductivity, the redox reactions of polysulfides adsorbed on transition metal oxide surface cannot occur in time and completely, thus increasing the electrode polarization. Herein, highly conductive Co4N nanocrystals were prepared and successfully used for separator modification of sulfur cathode. As an efficient intermediate layer, Co4N-Celgard not only effectively inhibited the diffusion and shuttle of polysulfides, but also promoted the corresponding conversion reactions due to its high catalytic activity and electrical conductivity, avoiding the ineffective accumulation of lithium polysulfides. Meanwhile, Co4N nanocrystals had good electrolyte affinity, which could effectively improve electrode dynamics. Based on the above advantages, Li–S cell with Co4N-Celgard separator exhibited high rate performance of 626 mA h g−1 at 4 C and low decay rate of 0.089 % per cycle.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Construction of frustrated Lewis pairs at N and Mo2C double sites boosts efficient electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe polysulfide shuttle effect and uncontrollable Li-dendrite growth on Li anode are the major reasons limiting the commercial development of Li-S batteries. Transition metal compounds on the carbon vector on the transition of polysulfides have been widely reported. However, there are few reports on the principle of simultaneous transformation and the effect of double active site spacing. Herein, we are based on the mechanism of the anchoring effect of doped elements on the carbon vector. Molybdenum carbide nanoparticles are mounted onto N-doped carbon nanosheets and coated on commercial separators (Mo2C-NCNS) for modification to satisfy the synchronization of S cathode and Li anode. The uniformly dispersed N element promotes the dispersion, homogenization and micro size regulation of Mo2C nanoparticles by anchoring Mo atoms. At the same time, the Mo2C site adjacent to N forms a spatially frustrated Lewis pairs with it. The reasonable spacing between them promotes the uniform deposition of lithium ions, the rapid transformation of polysulfides and the synchronous synergy between them. Characterization by XPS showed that using carbon as a bridge site further enhanced the strong metal-vector interaction between C3N4 and Mo2C, so as to improve the reaction kinetics. Thus, it has an initial specific capacity of 1186 mAh g−1 at 1C, and after 1000 cycles, 400 mAh g−1 remained, with a decay rate of only 0.06% per cycle. At a current density of 1 mA/cm2, the symmetric cell with Mo2C-NCNS modified separator exhibits steady cyclability over 1500 h, with a small overpotential of 76 mV.",Chemical Engineering Science
Modulation of hierarchical porosity in metal-doping graphene/carbon hybrid aerogels for capacitive energy storage,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdCarbon aerogels hold great promise as the electrode materials for energy storage owing to their desirable porous structures and specific surface areas. Here, we report a scalable approach for the preparation of Co-doped graphene/carbon hybrid aerogel (CGCA) with hierarchically porous structure through a dual cross-linking strategy. By adjusting the cross-linking structure of the hydrogel precursor, the porous structure of CGCA can be readily regulated and the specific surface area of CGCA can achieve 1217 m2 g−1. As a result, the CGCA samples not only manifest improved electrical conductivity, but also possess enhanced capacitance storage capacity. The optimized CGCA electrode displays a high specific capacitance of 371 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and maintains a large specific capacitance of 57 % at 150 A g−1. Meanwhile, the supercapacitor assembled with CGCA electrodes shows a high specific capacitance of 80 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and good cyclic stability with a capacitance retention of 95 % after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, the supercapacitor device can provide a high energy density of 11.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 250 W kg−1. The superior energy-storage behaviors of CGCA make them promising electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.",Journal of Energy Storage
"Electricity market integration of utility-scale battery energy storage units in Ireland, the status and future regulatory frameworks","© 2022 The AuthorsIreland is an interesting case for the integration of battery energy storage in the electricity market because of its ambitious renewable energy targets, the limited potential of strong interconnections to the neighboring power systems (with non-correlated wind resources), and a very limited potential to deploy large-scale mechanical energy storage such as pumped storage hydropower plants. We find that battery energy storage can become one of the cornerstones of the energy storage portfolio in Ireland and also one of the few options which can enable the Irish electricity sector to access the required domestic flexibility resources. Considering the policy perspective at the European level, and a comprehensive assessment of the regulatory and electricity market instructions at the national level in Ireland, we recommend policies for enabling the full potential of battery energy storage units (BSUs). The proposed policies represent promising solutions to the current challenges that BSUs encounter in Ireland and increase the alignment of national-level policy and market instructions with the European level directives and regulations.",Journal of Energy Storage
A stable anode-free Na-S full cell at room temperature,"© 2022The extended cycling life of room-temperature Na-S batteries depends predominantly on the excessive Na metal. Inhibiting Na corrosion by soluble Na polysulfides (NaPS) and reducing the usage of Na metal are key challenges to achieve practical Na-S batteries. Herein, an anode-free Na-S full cell is assembled with Na2S@carbon paper cathode prepared by in situ carbon-thermal reduction of Na2SO4, and 3D current collector (3DCC) of carbon nanofibers at the anode side, extraordinarily using Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as electrolyte additive. This Na2S-based 3DCC||Na2S full cell not only provides stoichiometric Na source but also permits FEC to participate in formation of SEI on 3DCC ahead of the production of soluble NaPS during the initial charging, overcoming the incompatibility of FEC in Na-S battery. The polysulfide-resistant SEI guarantees the stable plating/stripping of volume-expansion alleviated Na metal on 3DCC. The as-developed anode-free 3DCC||Na2S full cell demonstrates 500-cycle life at 0.5 C, delivering much higher overall energy density than those using excessive Na metal. This is the first report of rechargeable anode-free Na-S battery with satisfactory cycling durability, representing a significant step toward achieving practical Na-S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Mechanism elaboration on the thermal decomposition of ether electrolyte in sodium-ion battery,"© 2022The thermodynamic parameters and thermal decomposition characteristics of the ether electrolyte are important to the performance and safety of sodium-ion batteries. This study offered an underlying understanding in detecting, quantifying and revealing the thermal decomposition mechanism of DEGDME ether electrolyte, especially under the effects of transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) anode CoS2/C. Firstly, a customized high-pressure reactor was used to address the influences of sodium salt on the exothermic temperature and pressure changes during the thermal decomposition of the ether electrolytes. Secondly, the thermodynamic characteristics of the ether electrolyte under the effects of anode were quantitatively analyzed based on the Arrhenius law. Thirdly, the step-by-step reaction mechanism for the thermal decomposition of the ether electrolyte was explored by an in-situ synchrotron radiation vacuum extreme ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry technology, supplemented by DFT simulation calculation. Several interesting phenomena and original mechanisms were discovered, showing that the TMCs anode CoS2/C could reduce the decomposition activation energy of the DEGDME (i.e., the maximum decrease is 10.2 kJ mol−1) and catalytically accelerate the thermal decomposition reaction (i.e., the heating rate was increased by 29.8 times). At the same time, a small amount of O2 produced when the temperature reached 242.5°C, rising the risk of the sodium-ion battery. The research outcomes of this study can provide a guidance to the safety evaluation and optimization of the electrolytes in commercial sodium-ion batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Effect of specifically-adsorbed polysulfides on the electron transfer kinetics of sodium metal anodes,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesRoom-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries hold great promise for large-scale energy storage applications owing to the high energy density and earth-abundance of Na and S. However, the dissolution and migration of sodium polysulfides, uncontrollable Na dendrite growth, and the lack of studies on Na electrodeposition kinetics have hindered the development of these batteries. Herein, we reveal the mechanism of sodium polysulfides on the Na plating/stripping kinetics using a three-electrode system. First, the kinetic behavior deviates from the commonly supposed Butler–Volmer model, which is well described by the Marcus model. In addition, the specific adsorption of polysulfides on the sodium electrode surface is a key factor influencing the kinetics. Higher-order polysulfides (S82− and S62−) exhibit distinct specific adsorption behaviors because of their high adsorption energies compared to lower-order polysulfides (S42− and S22−). The electrostatic effect caused by specific adsorption can accelerate the kinetics, whereas the blocking effect can slow the kinetics. Thus, this competitive relationship enables low concentrations of high-order polysulfides to stimulate kinetics. This implies that a weak shuttle effect is beneficial for obtaining a stable Na deposition in RT Na-S batteries. An in-depth understanding of the Na electrodeposition kinetics provides beneficial clues for future metal sodium/electrolyte interface designs.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
A highly-efficient electrocatalyst for room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries: assembled nitrogen-doped hollow porous carbon spheres decorated with ultrafine α-MoC1-x nanoparticles,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.While room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery is considered one of the most promising technologies for next-generation energy storage, its commoditization is constrained by the shuttling and sluggish redox kinetics of the sulfur electrode. Herein, a honeycomb-like sulfur electrocatalyst with ultrafine α-MoC1-x nanoparticles uniformly distributed on nitrogen-doped hollow porous carbon spheres (MoC@NHC) is designed and synthesized. Prepared through a template-assisted strategy followed by a self-assembly and pyrolysis process, the interconnected hollow porous structure of MoC@NHC provides not only a microenvironment for confinement of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) but also sufficient free space for accommodation of volume change during electrochemical cycling. Moreover, the polar α-MoC1-x nanoparticles coupled with N-doped carbon provides strong affinity to NaPSs and promote catalytic conversion of NaPSs, as confirmed by experimental results and theoretical calculations. Owing to the physical and chemical dual confinement effect and the fast conversion kinetics of NaPSs, the S/MoC@NHC-15 cathode demonstrates good rate performances (351.8 mAh g−1 at 10 C) and outstanding cyclability (retaining capacities of 418.4 and 312.6 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1 and 5 C, respectively). This study introduces a simple and effective method for fabrication of S/MoC@NHC cathode materials for high-performance RT Na-S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Kinetic optimization of odor adsorption with acetate fiber cloth prepared from waste cigarette filter,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Odor pollution with NH3 as major contributor is a notorious issue that strongly influences our living environment. NH3 removal with acetate fiber cloth (AFC) prepared from waste cigarette filter is an economic feasible approach for simultaneous solid wastes disposal. Herein, waste cigarette filter was used to prepare AFC through hot-pressing approach, which was convinced to have good adsorption efficiency on NH3 due to large specific surface area. Effects of hot-pressing temperature, pressure and pressing time on AFC mechanical property and NH3 adsorption efficiencies were optimized by response surface method. As results, hot-pressing treatment improved the specific surface area of AFC to 9.530 m2/g, and thus enhanced NH3 adsorption efficiency to 68.73 % under hot-pressing temperature of 146 °C, pressure of 12.5 kPa and pressing time of 33 min. While the optimal tensile strength of AFC was obtained as 90.43 N under hot-pressing temperature of 140 °C, pressure of 15.0 kPa and pressing time of 30 min. The work provided an economic feasible approach for waste cigarette filter recycling and odor control.",Science of the Total Environment

Fundamental insight into the interaction between a lithium salt and an inorganic filler for ion mobility using a synergic theoretical-experimental approach,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The present paper aims at providing a fundamental insight into the interaction between a lithium salt and an inorganic filler in a perspective of lithium mobility. Through a synergistic approach, coupling experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations, the influence of the surface chemical state of the nanosilica Stöber-type on the dissociation of LiTFSI and its impact on the lithium conduction properties are studied. For this purpose, the surface modification of silica nanoparticles was performed by different methods such as calcination, lithiation and capping with organosilane. The impact of the surface modification on the dissociation of the lithium salt is further investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy after impregnation of the material with a defined amount of lithium salt. The combined experimental and in silico analyses of the results, performed for the first time on such systems, allow a detailed understanding of the interaction between the salt and the support and should prove itself useful for the future design of hybrid polymer electrolytes in new generation batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

In situ separator modification via CVD-derived N-doped carbon for highly reversible Zn metal anodes,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press.Attention toward aqueous zinc-ion battery has soared recently due to its operation safety and environmental benignity. Nonetheless, dendrite formation and side reactions occurred at the anode side greatly hinder its practical application. Herein, we adopt direct plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition strategy to in situ grow N-doped carbon (NC) over commercial glass fiber separator targeting a highly stabilized Zn anode. The strong zincophilicity of such a new separator would reduce the nucleation overpotential of Zn and enhance the Zn-ion transference number, thereby alleviating side reactions. Symmetric cells equipped with NC-modified separator harvest a stable cycling for more than 1,100 h under 1 mA·cm−2/1 mAh·cm−2. With the assistance of NC, the depth of discharge of Zn anode reaches as high as 42.7%. When assembled into full cells, the zinc-ion battery based on NC-modified separator could maintain 79% of its initial capacity (251 mAh·g−1) at 5 A·g−1 after 1,000 cycles.

Dendrite-free and corrosion-resistant sodium metal anode for enhanced sodium batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Because of the high theoretical special capacity, low cost, and low redox potential of sodium (Na) metal, it has been regarded as an ultimate anode for high-energy–density Na metal batteries. Nevertheless, Na metal suffers from dendrite formation due to a non-uniform Na deposition and unstable interface between Na and electrolyte, resulting in a short circuit and low Coulombic efficiency. Herein, a Zn coating on the Na metal surface as a nucleation and protective layer was fabricated through an in-situ chemical method involving a simple dripping ZnCl2-tetrahydrofuran solution. The Zn coating endows Na with corrosion-resistance in organic ether-based electrolytes and a polysulfide solution. More importantly, Zn coating on Na enables a low nucleation overpotential due to its sodiophilic property, giving rise to a uniform Na deposition. Consequently, Zn-coated Na showed a stable cycling over 1200 h at 1 mA cm−2 with a high capacity of 2 mA h cm−2 in symmetric cells. When combined with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, full cells with Zn-coated Na demonstrated a good cycling stability and rate capability. This work presents a simple, effective and promising approach of designing a dendrite-free and corrosion-resistant Na metal anode for enhanced Na metal batteries.",Applied Surface Science

A comprehensive state-of-the-art review of electrochemical battery storage systems for power grids,"© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.As the world's population and living standards rise, energy suppliers will face increased electrical energy needs. Furthermore, the European Commission has established a goal to reduce fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Kyoto and Paris Protocols. As a result, governments are more likely to integrate renewable energy into their electricity grids. However, since renewable energy resources are intermittent, power grid systems confront considerable hurdles. By overcoming the intermittency of renewable energy resources, battery storage systems are one way to optimize load and demand. Many studies show that the stored energy can be used in high demand. This may reduce the cost of production in the long run.

Multi-scale study on a synergetic multimetal-based selenide anode with nitrogen-doped porous carbon support for high-performance lithium storage,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transition metal selenides (TMSes) are promising substitutes for graphite anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The deficiency of rational strategies to solve the issues of intrinsic activity, synergistic sites deficiency, and structural simplicity for TMSes restricts their application in LIBs. Herein, a hierarchical multi-metal (Fe, Co) modified nanorod-like selenide with nitrogen-coordinated porous carbon support (CoFeSe/NC) is synthesized to intensify the intrinsic activity and structural stability of the derived material via a well-designed Fe-doped ZnCo-based multi-metal organic framework as a precursor.

Construction of high-performance sulfurized poly(acrylonitrile) cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries via catalytic and conductive regulation,"© 2022Sulfurized poly(acrylonitrile) (SPAN) is an attractive cathode material for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with demonstrated stable cycling, reduced polysulfide shuttle, and low self-discharge rates. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of SPAN cathodes greatly limit their capacity output and rate performance. Here, we report novel Se0.03SPAN/CNT-3 nanofibers as sulfur cathode materials, aiming to promote the redox kinetics of sulfur conversion by imparting both electronic conductivity and catalytic activity to SPAN. Specifically, selenium is uniformly distributed in the Se0.03SPAN/CNT-3 composite through Se–S bonds and facilitates the fast transport of Li-ions. While the CNTs embedded in nanofibers enable high electronic conductivity and provide extra contact between electrode and electrolyte, offering smooth transport channels for both electrons and ions. As a result, the Se0.03SPAN/CNT-3 cathode presents a high reversible capacity (791 mAh g−1composite at 0.2 C), superior rate performance (638 mAh g−1composite at 4 C), and extremely stable cycle life over 800 cycles. In particular, when tested in practical conditions of high areal loading (Se0.03S: 5.2 mg cm−2) and lean electrolyte (E/Se0.03S: 10 μL mg−1), this cathode delivers high reversible capacities of 733 mAh g−1composite (0.1 C) and 672 mAh g−1composite (0.2 C), demonstrating its great potential for future application.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Boosting Cathode Activity and Anode Stability of Zn-S Batteries in Aqueous Media Through Cosolvent-Catalyst Synergy,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Aqueous Zn−S battery with high energy density represents a promising large-scale energy storage technology, but its application is severely hindered by the poor reversibility of both S cathode and Zn anode. Herein, we develop a “cocktail optimized” electrolyte containing tetraglyme (G4) and water as co-solvents and I2 as additive. The G4-I2 synergy could activate efficient polar I3−/I− catalyst couple and shield the cathode from water, thus facilitating the conversion kinetics of S and suppressing the interfacial side reactions. Simultaneously, it could stabilize Zn anode by forming an organic–inorganic interphase upon cycling. With boosted electrodes reversibility, the Zn−S cell delivers a high capacity of 775 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1, and retains over 70 % capacity after 600 cycles at 4 A g−1. The advances can also be readily generalized to other ethers/water hybrid electrolytes, showing the universality of the “cocktail optimized” electrolyte design strategy.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Capillary force induced the sodium metal infusion in the Sn@HCNF scaffold: A mechanical flexible metallic battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The practical exploitation of the sodium metallic anodes (SMA), especially in the energy-dense battery models, is impeded by the progressive reactivity of the sodium (Na) deposits in the aprotic electrolyte, which leads to the dynamic interfacial properties, Na cation depletion and parasitic substrate pulverization. Through the coaxial electrospinning technique, herein, we exquisitely engineer the spatial arrangement and Na affinity of a mechanical-flexible, lightweight (1.0 mg cm−2) SMA scaffold, in which the carbothermal reduced Sn nanocrystallines are homogeneously riveted within the hollow carbon nanofibers (Sn@HCNF). Subsequently, the capillary effect induces the molten Na infusion into the hollow fibers at the preset amount, which enables the Na15Sn4 alloy formation and simplifies the presodiation procedure. As the pre-infused Na–Sn@HCNF anode (0.5* Na excess) coupled with NaVPO4F cathode (∼8.6 mg cm−2) in a proof-of-concept full cell model (2 mA h), the gravimetric energy density of 311.44 W h kg−1 at the maximized power output of 1245.76 W kg−1 (calculations based on the electroactive materials), as well as the robust cycling (89.6% for 300 cycles) upon various geometric flexing states are simultaneously achieved. This capillary driving strategy provides a scalable, straightforward, site-specific presodiation approach, which encourages the facile prototyping of the mechanical-flexible metallic batteries.",Journal of Power Sources
Yolk-double shells hierarchical N-doped carbon nanosphere as an electrochemical nanoreactor for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdRechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising emerging energy technology due to their high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, the shuttle effect from the weak adsorption, poor diffusion-transfer, and insufficient catalytic site restrains further applications. Herein, the yolk-double shells hierarchical N-doped carbon nanospheres (NCS@C-800) were designed as an electrochemical nanoreactor, the material consists of high-content N-doped core-shell carbon nanospheres and a highly graphitized outer carbon shell, which has a gradient of N content. The unique structure host has many advantages, such as huge internal voids, ordered pore structure, and high electrical conductivity. In addition to the introduction of the N element, which offered a large number of adsorption and catalytic sites. Therefore, the NCS@C-800 effectively addresses the three above primary issues for constructing high performance Li–S. The results show that at 500 cycles at 1 C, the as-prepared material is 649 mAh g−1, while at 1000 cycles at 2 C it is 400 mAh g−1, with ultra-low capacity decays of 0.055% and 0.051% per cycle, respectively. More importantly, with an increase in S loading up to 5.43 mg cm−2, it still maintained excellent cycling stability.

Conductive-free Zn2GeO4 @multi-walled carbon nanotubes for high-performance lithium-ion storage,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A new composite of Zn2GeO4 @multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Zn2GeO4 @MWCNTs) has been synthesized by using a facial microwave assisted hydrothermal method, and found that the Zn2GeO4 nanorods were anchored on the surface of MWCNTs and embedded into the voids of MWCNTs aggregation, which could provide a conductive network for fast transport of ion and a buffer space for volumetric change during the charge-discharge process. The MWCNTs in the composite has also acted as conductive agent, avoiding the use of additional conductive agents. When used as an anode for LIBs, this composite delivered a high specific capacity of 1397.9 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 300 cycles, an excellent rate capability and long cycling stability over1800 cycles at a high rate of 1.0 A g−1. The results of in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements showed that the Li22Ge5 was formed during the discharge process, and others were amorphous phase, which can provide more active sites for lithium storage, and is beneficial to the fast diffusion of lithium ion, resulting in superb cycling performance.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
High-density catalytic heterostructures strung by buried-in carbon tube network as monolithic holey host for endurable Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of Li-S batteries (LSBs) is plagued by the unreasonable integration of adsorption-catalysis-conduction functional modules. Heterojunction domains are expected to achieve the job-sharing catalysis and adsorption effects, which are however degraded by the loose discrete distribution and insufficient exposure of catalyst. Herein, we propose a unique catalysis-conduction configuration for S cathode host, featured by in-situ cascade of carbon nanotube (CNT) network with polar NiCoP/CoP heterojunction grains strung on each CNT (NiCoP/CoP@C). The compact and high-density distribution of phosphide heterostructures maximizes the exposure of catalytic sites to synergically enhance the conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides. It also enables an effective hiding of CNT skeletons to avoid the loose and uneven deposition of S-based species without the compromise of interconnected conduction pathways and electrode robustness. NiCoP/CoP@C ternary host with monolithic holey texture endows LSBs with excellent cycling stability (with capacity decay rate of merely 0.029% per cycle over 1000 cycles) under high sulfur utilization and high rate (at 2C). Even with a high sulfur loading (7.5 mg/cm2) and a low E/S ratio (7.2 µL/mg), the reversible capacity is still as high as 562 mAh/g and 4.21 mAh/cm2 after 300 cycles. The combination of low E/S ratio of 5.0 μL/mg and high S loading of 5.0 mg/cm2 still enables the durability of Li-S batteries for at least 360 cycles at 1C and highly reversible capacity close to 600 mAh/g at 0.5C.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Silver particles deposited onto magnetic carbon nanofibers as highly active catalysts for 4-nitrophenol reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.We used CO2 as a carbon source for conversion to carbon nanofibers through the catalytic hydrogenation reaction on a Ni-Na/Al2O3 catalyst. The Ag+ adsorbed on carbon nanofibers could be spontaneously reduced through the oxidation–reduction reaction Ni + 2Ag+ →2Ag + Ni2+. The adsorbed Ag+ was reduced by the electrons released from Ni, forming Ag particles on the carbon surface. The Ag deposited on the magnetic carbon nanofibers was employed to remove contaminants in water, in which 4-nitrophenol was reduced to 4-aminophenol. The apparent rate of 4-nitrophenol reduction was significantly enhanced with increasing Ag concentration in the range of 0.5–2.6 wt%, from 8.5 × 10-3 to 1.25 × 10-1 s-1. The negative charge on the surface when Ag particles formed was assumed to be an important factor in enhancing the catalytic rate because of the increases in the coverage and adsorption rate of 4-NP on the catalyst surface.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Self-supported hierarchically porous 3D carbon nanofiber network comprising Ni/Co/NiCo2O4 nanocrystals and hollow N-doped C nanocages as sulfur host for highly reversible Li–S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (P-N-CNF) comprise well-embedded metallic-Ni/Co and spinel-type NiCo2O4 nanocrystals (Ni-Co/NiCo2O4) along with metal-organic framework-derived hollow nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages (HNC), denoted as P-N-CNF@NCO/HNC, are rationally designed as cathode substrates for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries with feasible parameters. The highly conductive and porous N-CNF matrix provides numerous conductive channels for rapid ionic and electronic transfer. HNC guarantees efficient impregnation of a large volume of active material along with high loading, channelizing the volume variation stress, and ensuring efficient electrolyte percolation, which is crucial for uniform dispersion and high active sulfur utilization, especially at low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios. The metallic-Ni/Co and polar spinel-type NiCo2O4 nanoparticles offer sufficient chemisorption sites to prevent polysulfide migration towards the anode. Li-S cells assembled using P-N-CNF@NCO/HNC as an advanced host and lithium polysulfide catholyte as the starting material displayed stable electrochemical performance even with strident battery parameters, including high sulfur content (79.8 wt%), high sulfur loading (7.7 mg cm−2), and low E/S ratio (8.0 µL mg−1). The cell displays a maximum areal capacity of 5.4 mA h cm−2 that stabilizes to 2.8 mA h cm−2 after 160 cycles at 0.1 C and is comparable to the theoretical threshold of presently available commercial systems.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Robust superhydrophobic coating with hollow SiO2/PAA-b-PS Janus microspheres for self-cleaning and oil–water separation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Superhydrophobic coating can be widely used in many fields because it is not easily wetted by water like lotus leaves. However, most of superhydrophobic coating is difficult to withstand abrasion attack. Herein, hollow SiO2/PAA-b-PS Janus microspheres were synthesized via emulsion interfacial synthesis method using amphiphilic block copolymer of polyacrylic acid block polystyrene (PAA-b-PS) and hollow NH2-SiO2 microspheres as raw materials in this paper. Because the hemisphere grafting organic polymer chain was hydrophobic and the other hemisphere was hydrophilic and contained amino groups, hollow SiO2/PAA-b-PS Janus microspheres exhibited amphiphilic and asymmetrical nature, which was a typical inorganic/polymer Janus microspheres. Robust superhydrophobic coating was facilely achieved using hollow SiO2/PAA-b-PS Janus microspheres on polyurethane pretreated substrate like leather and fabric. Robust superhydrophobic coating after 90 sandpaper abrasion cycles still retained excellent superhydrophobicity. As expected, robust superhydrophobic coating had prominent self-cleaning property against different pollutants and was capable to separate a variety of oil–water mixtures with ultrahigh separation efficiency. The separation efficiency of robust superhydrophobic coating for oil–water mixture was maintained above 98% even after 40 separation cycles. In total, robust superhydrophobic coating constructed by hollow SiO2/PAA-b-PS Janus microspheres possesses distinguished superhydrophobicity, abrasion resistance, self-cleaning, oil–water separation capacity and universality, which shows a promising application in multifunctional coating.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Stable sodium metal anodes enabled by an in-situ generated mixed-ion/electron-conducting interface,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Sodium metal has been regarded as one of excellent candidates of anode materials for the next-generation high-energy sodium-ion batteries owing to its low redox potential, low cost, and high theoretical capacity. However, the poor reversibility and the dendrite growth of Na anode on cycling have significantly hindered the practical application of sodium metal anodes (SMAs). Herein, we report that a mixed-ion/electron-conducting interface (MIECI) layer, in-situ generated through the conversion of CuP2 into the mixed conductor of Cu and Na3P, enable dendrite-free Na plating/stripping in ether-based electrolyte. The MIECI layer can significantly improve the affinity with the deposited Na, homogenize the Na+ flux, and reduce the local current density. The MIECI layer enables Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Na plating/stripping as high as 99.71% over 420 cycles at 2 mA h cm−2 and 2 mA cm−2 as well as the Na||Na cell to stably cycle for 1200 h (300 cycles) with a depth of discharge of 33.33 % at 2 mA h cm−2. It is found that the current density plays a greater influence on the SMA stability. The in-situ construction of MIECI buffer layer opens up a simple and facile avenue to stabilize SMAs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Subnanometer MoP clusters confined in mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) as superior electrocatalytic sulfur hosts for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are promising high-energy–density storage devices but severe shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LPSs), low sulfur utilization and sluggish reaction kinetics impede the practical applications. Herein, we report MoP clusters embedded in CMK-3 (cMoP-CMK-3) as a lightweight, conductive, and catalytic cathodic host with large sulfur mass loading for high energy Li-S batteries. The electronically conductive CMK-3 with ordered mesoporous channels could accommodate high loading and expansion of the active sulfur material and facilitate fast ionic/electronic transportation. The strong interaction between cMoP and CMK-3 results in concentrated Li ions inside the channels due to enhanced local electric field, significantly eliminating dead sulfur and improving sulfur utilization to over 90% due to confined catalytic effect. Moreover, the cMoP embedded into channels provide rich adsorptive and catalytic sites to effectively trap LPSs, and catalytically accelerate reaction kinetics. The resulting S@cMoP-CMK-3 cathode shows a large capacity of 1100 mAh g−1 at 0.5C (1C = 1675 mA g−1) based on the total mass of cathode, high-rate capacity of 767.8 mAh g−1 at 5C, and excellent cycle stability with 0.02% capacity fade per cycle over 500 cycles at 2C. This work demonstrates a confined catalytic strategy to improve the sulfur utilization for high-energy Li-S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Electrospun-nanofibrous Redox-active separator for enhancing the capacity of Lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSeparator is a key component of lithium-ion battery (LIB), and a redox-active separator can enhance the capacity of LIB by participating in battery reactions. This paper reports a redox-active separator based on Fe(CN)64- doped polypyrrole (PPy) composite nanofibers fabricated by electrospinning and in-situ polymerization. The separator is composed of one layer of Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)@doped-PPy core–shell structured nanofibers and another layer of PAN nanofibers. The porosity, electrolyte uptake, and ionic conductivity of the optimized redox-active separator are 79.3 ± 7.1%, 294.6 ± 31.5%, and 1.57 ± 0.06 mS∙cm−1, respectively. These values are greater than those of a commercial PP separator, 41%, 81.5 ± 17.4%, and 0.75 ± 0.02 mS∙cm−1, respectively. Accordingly, the discharge capacity of the battery cell with the redox-active separator is up to 158.7–227.0 mAh∙g−1 at the current rates of 2.0–0.2C, outperforming conventional inert separators. The enhanced battery capacity is stemmed from the redox activity of the doped-PPy polymer, as evidenced by the wider cathodic and anodic peaks in the cyclic voltammetry. In addition, the battery cells tested with redox-active separators show gravimetric energy densities of up to 103.0 mAh∙g−1, which is 56.1% and 27.2% greater than those of a commercial PP separator and the redox-active separator reported in the literature.",Chemical Engineering Science
Enhancing energy efficiency and long-term durability of vanadium redox flow battery with catalytically graphitized carbon fiber felts as electrodes by boron doping,"© 2022A boron doping on a commercial carbon fiber felt (CFF) is used to assemble a high-performance vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB). The CFF is immersed in the boric acid solution and subjected to a heat-treatment up to 2700 °C. The crystallinity of the boron-doped samples increases more than threefold when compared to only heat-treated CFF, indicating that boron induces CFF to highly graphitized CFF. As a result, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry reveal that boron-doped CFFs increase electrical conductivities. In addition, when the boron-doped CFFs are applied to VRFB electrodes, their electrochemical performances are improved compared to CFF and only heat-treated CFF. The CFFB5 that is a sample containing 0.6 at.% of boron contents exhibits the best electrochemical performance in the single-cell test compared to the other samples. In particular, the CFFB5 sample provides excellent energy efficiency (90% at 50 mA cm–2) and long-term durability (98.1% over 150 cycles). Consequently, our approach introduces effective modulation of commercially available CFF with a significant graphitization via a feasible boron doping method and we conclude that the resulting boron-doped CFF induces improved electrochemical performance for VRFB applications when the appropriate amount of a doping agent is provided.",Electrochimica Acta
Surface Film Formation from Sodium Polysulfide Decomposition on Sodium-Metal Anode Surface,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries are being considered as an alternative next generation of energy storage devices to replace lithium-sulfur batteries due to lower costs of Na metal while keeping a high theoretical capacity. A comprehensive understanding of polysulfide decomposition mechanisms and passivation film formation on the Na-metal surface has challenged the development of this metal-sulfur chemistry. Here, using first-principles modeling, we study the adsorption of sodium polysulfide (NaPS) molecules on the Na-metal surface and investigate the Na2S film formation from soluble NaPS decomposition in the presence of different electrolyte solvents (i.e., EC, PC, and EC/PC mixture). We find that NaPS molecules strongly interact with the Na-metal surface via Na-S bonds, leading to charge migration from the metal to the adsorbates. Such strong adsorption precedes a complete spontaneous electron-transfer decomposition of NaPS to form an amorphous Na2S film on the anode surface. The reduction reaction mechanisms are identified for each electrolyte, suggesting that polysulfides are completely decomposed in a short time. The energetic properties suggest that the first and second steps in the reaction of NaPS decomposition in the mixture solvent are thermodynamically uphill. The decomposed S atoms from NaPS can insert into the Na slab, leading to Na2S formation. The decomposition of multiple NaPS molecules reveals that the reduction of further NaPS on the surface after the first one is sluggish and incomplete because of the passivating nature of the nascent Na2S film, while NaPS far from the surface remains in the electrolyte phase forming a soluble NaPS cluster dissolved in the solvent.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Rational Design of Sulfur-Doped Carbon with Expanded Inter-layer Spacing toward Anode Material of Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.For renewable energy storage, it is critical to develop effective carbon-based anode materials for sodium-ion storage, and heteroatom doping is a viable method for fine-tuning the electrochemical performance of carbon materials. Heteroatom-doped carbon materials, especially sulfur-doped carbon (CS) materials, have been the favored anode material to provide enhanced specific capacity for sodium-ion batteries. This report provides a method for the successful preparation of CSs from thiophene as a single-source precursor accompanied by annealing at a high temperature. The existence of sulfur provides expanded interlayers of carbon, and via changing the pyrolysis temperature (1000-1200 °C), the sulfur content is varied. Under a current density of 25 mA g-1, the produced electrode material acts as an anode and exhibits a specific capacity of almost 243 mA h g-1. The fabricated electrode also exhibits outstanding cyclic stability, sustaining 77% at 100 mA g-1 current over 500 cycles. The synergistic effect of sulfur and expanded interlayers of carbon brought on by the doping of sulfur atoms can be the reason for the optimized carbon's improved performance.",Energy and Fuels
Effect of cobalt doping-regulated crystallinity in nickel-iron layered double hydroxide catalyzing oxygen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The formation of a crystalline-amorphous (c-a) interface by modulating the crystallinity of the material is a promising strategy for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, a similar element substitution approach is reported in this study to regulate the catalyst's crystallinity. Adjustment of the cobalt content in NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) by the solvothermal method enables the control of c-a interfacial site of the material. In 1 M KOH, the as-obtained Co1.98-NiFe LDH exhibited a low overpotential of 236 mV to achieve 20 mA cm−2. It also showed excellent stability, operating steadily at high current densities for 96 h without significant degradation in 1 M KOH or alkaline artificial and natural seawater electrolytes. Therefore, the OER activity of the catalysts was improved while ensuring structural stability. We believe that this method will provide new insights and perspectives for the development of highly efficient and stable OER catalysts.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

Gallium-Telluride-Based Composite as Promising Lithium Storage Material,"© 2022 by the authors.Various applications of gallium telluride have been investigated, such as in optoelectronic devices, radiation detectors, solar cells, and semiconductors, owing to its unique electronic, mechanical, and structural properties. Among the various forms of gallium telluride (e.g., GaTe, Ga3Te4, Ga2Te3, and Ga2Te5), we propose a gallium (III) telluride (Ga2Te3)-based composite (Ga2Te3-TiO2-C) as a prospective anode for Li-ion batteries (LIBs). The lithiation/delithiation phase change mechanism of Ga2Te3 was examined. The existence of the TiO2-C hybrid buffering matrix improved the electrical conductivity as well as mechanical integrity of the composite anode for LIBs. Furthermore, the impact of the C concentration on the performance of Ga2Te3-TiO2-C was comprehensively studied through cyclic voltammetry, differential capacity analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The Ga2Te3-TiO2-C electrode showed high rate capability (capacity retention of 96% at 10 A g−1 relative to 0.1 A g−1) as well as high reversible specific capacity (769 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 100 mA g−1). The capacity of Ga2Te3-TiO2-C was enhanced by the synergistic interaction of TiO2 and amorphous C. It thereby outperformed the majority of the most recent Ga-based LIB electrodes. Thus, Ga2Te3-TiO2-C can be thought of as a prospective anode for LIBs in the future.",Nanomaterials

Stabilization residual oxygen reduces sulfur activity in hard carbon anode for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Sulfur-doped hard carbon materials are considered as the most promising candidate for anodes of sodium-ion batteries, since they can expand carbon interlayer spacing and form a highly active C–S bond in the carbon skeleton. However, the multiple hard carbons contain a large number of oxygen-containing functional groups, which are carried by themselves or be heat-treated in the air. Therefore, in this work, we are using electrospinning technology, then one-step sulfur doping and carbonization to prepare the highly active sulfur-doped carbon nanofibers (S-CNFs). The results indicate that the S-CNFs electrode has larger interlayer spacing, more active sites and C–S bonds, which can stockpile the additional sodium ion in the electrode material. The S-CNFs maintain the comparatively higher reversible capacity of 401.9 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 and excellent long cyclability of 258.3 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1 with Coulombic efficiency closing to 100%. In addition, the results also proved that these oxygen-containing functional groups will combine with the sulfur to form S=O bonds of inactive sulfur, which can reduce the adsorption capacity of sodium ions and impede the charge transfer of the electrode.",Journal of Materials Science
Construction of nanoporous Mo2C shell/MoO3 core composite by converting MoO3 and its superior performance in lithium sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is a promising energy storage device in the future. However, its performance is strongly affected by the shuttle effect and inherent sluggish kinetics. Herein, Mo2C/MoO3-modified separator is constructed, in which MoO3 particles are derived by the decomposition of Mo source and simultaneously their surfaces are converted (reduced and carbonized) into Mo2C, i.e., Mo2C shell/MoO3 core. In addition, the resin matrix of the waste CFRP (Carbon fiber reinforced polymer) acts as the carbon source for the change from MoO3 to Mo2C, while CF is claimed from CFRP. The synergistic effect of conductive Mo2C-shell and polar MoO3-core anchors lithium polysulfide to promote the conversion of sulfur. Benefited from block effect on the soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) and catalytic effect on sulfur, Li-S battery with Mo2C/MoO3-modified separator owns excellent electrochemical performance: A high initial discharge specific capacity of 1288 mAh g−1 at 0.2C and an initial capacity of 670 mAh g−1 at 4C, as well as the average decay rate per cycle of 0.039% over 250 times.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
Iron Sulfide Na2FeS2 as Positive Electrode Material with High Capacity and Reversibility Derived from Anion–Cation Redox in All-Solid-State Sodium Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Small published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.It is desirable for secondary batteries to have high capacities and long lifetimes. This paper reports the use of Na2FeS2 with a specific structure consisting of edge-shared and chained FeS4 as the host structure and as a high-capacity active electrode material. An all-solid-state sodium cell that uses Na2FeS2 exhibits a high capacity of 320 mAh g−1, which is close to the theoretical two-electron reaction capacity of 323 mAh g−1, and operates reversibly for 300 cycles. The excellent electrochemical properties of all-solid-state sodium cells are derived from the anion–cation redox and rigid host structure during charging/discharging. In addition to the initial one-electron reaction of NaxFeS2 (1 ≤ x ≤ 2) activated Fe2+/Fe3+ redox as the main redox center, the reversible sulfur redox further contributes to the high capacity. Although the additional sulfur redox affects the irreversible crystallographic changes, stable and reversible redox reactions are observed without capacity fading, owing to the local maintenance of the chained FeS4 in the host structure. Sodium iron sulfide Na2FeS2, which combines low-cost elements, is one of the candidates that can meet the high requirements of practical applications.",Small

A promising solution for drawbacks such as low sulfur utilization and cycling stability is the use of porous carbon as sulfur carrier. On the other hand, cyclic economy and green ideas is of great importance nowadays. Carbon-sulfur cathodes from waste valorization, abundant, and low-cost precursors is an attractive approach. Herein, an activated carbon (AC-Poc) derived from “Posidonia oceanica” sea-waste, was studied as a matrix for the development of a novel carbon–sulfur composite cathode (AC-Poc/S) for the first time. AC-Poc can be used as an effective sulfur host, due to its high specific BET surface area (1264 m2∙g−1) hierarchical porous structure, and total pore volume 0.81 cm3∙g−1.

Mo-Incorporated Magnetite Fe3O4 Featuring Cationic Vacancies Enabling Fast Lithium Intercalation for Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Transition metal oxides (TMOs) as high-capacity electrodes have several drawbacks owing to their inherent poor electronic conductivity and structural instability during the multi-electron conversion reaction process. In this study, the authors use an intrinsic high-valent cation substitution approach to stabilize cation-deficient magnetite (Fe3O4) and overcome the abovementioned issues. Herein, 5 at% of Mo4+-ions are incorporated into the spinel structure to substitute octahedral Fe3+-ions, featuring ≈1.7 at% cationic vacancies in the octahedral sites. This defective Fe2.93▫0.017Mo0.053O4 electrode shows significant improvements in the mitigation of capacity fade and the promotion of rate performance as compared to the pristine Fe3O4. Furthermore, physical-electrochemical analyses and theoretical calculations are performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms. In Fe2.93▫0.017Mo0.053O4, the cationic vacancies provide active sites for storing Li+ and vacancy-mediated Li+ migration paths with lower energy barriers. The enlarged lattice and improved electronic conductivity induced by larger doped-Mo4+ yield this defective oxide capable of fast lithium intercalation. This is confirmed by a combined characterization including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. This study provides a valuable strategy of vacancy-mediated reaction to intrinsically modulate the defective structure in TMOs for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.",Small
Adsorption mechanisms of different toxic molecular gases on intrinsic C2N and Ti-C2N-V monolayer: a DFT study,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Recently, the excessive emission of chemical toxic gases such as nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), ammonia (NH3), phosgene (COCL2), and benzene (C6H6) has caused serious environmental problems. Adsorption of these chemical toxic gas molecules is a promising method to reduce environmental pollution. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the adsorption properties of these chemical toxic molecules on intrinsic C2N and Ti-C2N-V monolayer. The results show that NF3, NH3, C6H6, and COCL2 can all be adsorbed to the intrinsic C2N monolayer with weak adsorption energy, while the adsorption properties of these gas molecules were greatly improved after doping Ti atom. The adsorption energy of NH3, C6H6, COCL2, and NF3 increased from − 0.585, − 0.432, − 0.633, and − 0.362 eV to − 2.214, − 1.699, − 1.822, and − 0.799 eV, respectively, which increased by 2 ~ 4 times compared with that before doping. Besides, the results of the electron distribution, work function, the total density of states (TDOS), and the partial density of states (PDOS) analysis indicate that the doped Ti atom can be used as a bridge to connect the adsorbed molecules with the C2N-V monolayer, strengthen their interaction, and significantly improve the adsorption capacity. Therefore, Ti-doped C2N-V (Ti-C2N-V) monolayer is a promising adsorbent for the enrichment and utilization of harmful gases.

High performance of the sodium-ion conducting flexible polymer blend composite electrolytes for electrochemical double-layer supercapacitor applications,"© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Herein, we present the synthesis of a nanocomposite blend of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), and various weight percent of nanofillers, BaTiO3, using a simple standard solution casting technique. The prepared nanocomposites are characterized in detail via techniques such as X-ray diffraction technique, field-emission scanning microscope, FTIR, and Raman spectra for confirming the crystal structure, morphology, and chemical bond formation within the samples, respectively. The suitable ionic conductivity of prepared samples is in the range of 10−4–10−8 S/cm at room temperature. Further, its maximum electrochemical stability window is ~4.1 V, and the ionic transference number is about 0.96 (15 wt%) at room temperature. The results associated with the optimized polymer nanocomposite motivated us to check its practical applicability for supercapacitors. The cyclic voltammetry of the fabricated cell based on optimized polymer as separator cum electrolyte appears as a distorted rectangle with no redox peaks. The cell charge storage mechanism is explored to be the electric double layer (EDLC) in nature. The maximum specific capacitance exhibited by the cell is nearly 4.4 F/g at a scan rate of 3 mV/s. The energy and power densities delivered by the same cell are equal to 27.7 W h kg−1 and 9972 W kg−1, respectively, which sustain for 100 cycles. The results of the designed cell reveal that both blend polymer composite electrolyte films and the composite electrode can be implemented to be used for EDLC supercapacitor.",Energy Storage

Catalytic Disproportionation for Suppressing Polysulfide Shuttle in Li–S Pouch Cells: Beyond Adsorption Interactions,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Addressing the lithium polysulfide shuttle is critical for the high-energy-density lithium–sulfur pouch cells in practical applications, especially under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions. In contrast to previously reported heterogeneous adsorption catalysis within cathode or separator with slow catalytic kinetics and limited adsorption area, herein, lithium difluorophosphate (LiPO2F2) is demonstrated as a homogeneous catalyst in electrolyte which mitigates polysulfide diffusion. The Li–S pouch cell with LiPO2F2 in the electrolyte has record-breaking shelving stability of two months, significantly improved capacity retention from 37.0% to 81.4% after long cycling, and electrical-car-level energy density over 400 Wh kg−1. A minimal amount of 1 wt% LiPO2F2 tends to facilitate lithium polysulfide disproportionation on the S/C cathode instead of in the electrolyte, which initiates the fast transformation of soluble lithium polysulfide to insoluble solid S8 and Li2S2/Li2S. The reliable mechanism of polysulfide disproportionation via biradicals is further proposed by both density functional theory calculation and experiments. To best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report on mechanism of polysulfide disproportionation via biradical intermediates. It is believed that this new insight into homogeneous catalytic mechanisms in electrolytes may pave the way for the commercialization of high-energy-density Li–S batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials

Nano-confinement coating strategy derived Matryoshka-like carbon nanotubes@anatase nanocrystalline@amorphous carbon nanofibers for ultrafast sodium ion storage,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdTitania is considered to be an attractive candidate as anode for sodium ion batteries due to excellent cycle stability, advanced safety features, and small volume deformation in the charge-discharge process. However, limited by sodium storage mechanism, the fast charge and discharge performance of multi-crystals titania is failed to satisfy the requirements of commercial application. Here, we develop a Matryoshka-like carbon nanotubes@anatase nanocrystalline@amorphous carbon (CNTs@aTiO2@C) nanofibers for ultrafast sodium ion storage. A nano-confinement coating strategy is demonstrated for constructing an intermediate layer assembled by ultrafine nanocrystalline (2-3 nm) of anatase. The synthesized Matryoshka-like nanofibers with diameters of ∼95 nm consists of amorphous carbon outer layer (10-13 nm), anatase nanocrystalline assembled intermediate layer (13-15 nm), and carbon nanotube core. Benefit from the ultra-refinement of anatase nanocrystalline and Matryoshka-like micro-morphology, the proportion of the capacitive-controlled contribution are up to 90.1 %, 90.6%, 91.9 %, 92.3%, and 93.6% with sweep rate increased from 0.2 to 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mV s−1, thus result in an outstanding reversible specific capacities of ∼120 mA h g−1 with Coulombic efficiency of ∼99.5% after long-life of 10000 cycles at ultrafast rate of 10 A g−1.",Electrochimica Acta

Constructing low N/P ratio sodium-based batteries by reversible Na metal electrodeposition on sodiophilic zinc-metal-decorated hard carbons,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Nowadays, the main deficiency in boosting the commercialization of sodium ion battery is the relatively low energy density. Herein, we propose a new way to significantly improve the energy density by constructing low negative/positive (N/P) ratio sodium-based batteries enabled by reversible Na metal electrodeposition on sodiophilic zinc-metal-decorated hard carbons (HC–Zn) anode. HC-Zn is used as a typical insertion anode, and simultaneously as a substrate for Na metal plating, leading to the formation of a composite NaxC-Na metal anode with a hybrid energy storage process. We also provide a general and low-cost method of Zn metal coating on various hard carbons. The compatibility between Zn and Na metal is firstly revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. As a result, HC-Zn electrode exhibits a highly reversibility even at a high-capacity of 1100 mA h g−1 and 5C rate, which can stably cycle 1400 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency around 100%. Finally, the full cells of HC-Zn anode coupling with sodium vanadyl phosphate cathode with low NP ratio (NP = 0.8 and 0.6) are constructed which display good cycling stability and remarkably improved energy density from 220 Wh/kg of regular NP 1.1 to 286 Wh/kg.",Journal of Power Sources
High-Wettability Composite Separator Embedded with in Situ Grown TiO2 Nanoparticles for Advanced Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The separator, as an important inner part of the sodium-ion battery (SIB), has a significant impact on the electrochemical performance and security of the battery. However, conventional polyolefin separators are inapplicable for SIBs due to their poor wettability to liquid electrolytes and unsatisfactory heat resistance. To address these problems, a novel polyethylene (PE)- hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC)-TiO2 composite separator modified on the PE matrix is proposed and successfully prepared by a multistep synthesis procedure of HEC coating and TiO2 in situ self-growth, while almost maintaining the initial separator thickness. Compared with conventional PE separators, this composite separator possesses remarkable wettability which benefits from the introduction of a polar HEC-TiO2-incorporated coating. Besides, thanks to a significant improvement in wettability, the separator presents high electrolyte uptake of up to 186.5% and an extraordinary ionic conductivity of 0.342 mS cm−1. As expected, a Na|Na3V2(PO4)3 battery with the PE-HEC-TiO2 separator exhibits a reversible capacity of 99.0 mAh g−1 and a capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles at 5 C with a steady Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. These brilliant performances convincingly make it a promising separator for advanced SIBs with high reversibility, high capacity, and long life.",Energy Technology

But the large-scale adoption of EVs still is hindered by long charging time. The high-energy LIBs are unable to be safely fast-charged due to their electrode materials with unsatisfactory rate performance.

A Highly Stable All-Solid-State Na–O2/H2O Battery with Low Overpotential Based on Sodium Hydroxide,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The rechargeable all-solid-state Na–O2 battery is one of the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices owing to its high theoretical specific energy, safety, electrochemical stability, and abundant Na resources. However, the practical implementation of current all-solid-state Na–O2 batteries is still limited by low-resistance interfaces, low energy efficiency, and poor cycle life. Herein, an all-solid-state Na–O2/H2O battery that can sustain highly reversible cycling with a low overpotential is reported. Using a customized silver–polymer composite cathode, this battery can be operated under ≈7% relative humidity (RH) at 80 °C and cycled for more than 100 times with a low overpotential (≈75 mV at 100th cycle) and high round trip efficiency >97% at 100th cycle) at an energy density of 20 mA g−1. Furthermore, mechanistic insight that the RH intimately controls the type and hydration state of the discharge product is also provided, and thereby the charge kinetics and battery performance are modulated. It is also revealed that silver catalyst can efficiently reduce the reaction barrier of NaOH decomposition. With the further optimization, this battery potentially can be implemented in real-world applications and confer practical applicability that can extend to other energy-storage systems, such as other metal–air batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
"Iron (Fe, Ni, Co)-based transition metal compounds for lithium-sulfur batteries: Mechanism, progress and prospects","© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesLithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have a high theoretical capacity, which is considered as one of the most promising high-energy–density secondary batteries due to the double electrons reaction of sulfur. However, the shuttle effects of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish redox kinetics lead to their materials capacity loss and cycle stability deterioration, which restrains LSBs commercialization. Metallic compounds as additions can improve the electrochemical performance of the Li–S system, through the trap of LiPSs and accelerate the conversion of the soluble LiPSs. Among of them, the iron group elements (Fe, Ni, Co)-based compounds are the promising materials for the LSBs, due to their unique outer electronic structure and its tunable properties, low cost, abundant in the earth, environmental benignity, controllable and scalable prepared, and so on. In this review, we have made a summary for iron-based compounds to capture LiPSs according to lithium bond, sulfur bond and magnetic force. The type of iron-based compound including oxides, sulfides, nitrides, phosphides, carbides, and so on, and we have investigated the electrocatalytic mechanism of these materials.

N-doped hollow carbon spheres as a high-performance anode for potassium-based dual-ion battery,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdPotassium-based dual-ion batteries (KDIBs) have become an alternative product for lithium-ion batteries owing to their high voltage, environmental friendliness and low cost. In this paper, nitrogen-doped activated hollow carbon nanospheres (N-AHCSs) with high specific surface area, porous structures and large interlayer spacing were prepared as anodes for KDIBs. The N-AHCSs are characterized by large interlayer spacing, hollow spheres structures and doping nitrogen. The large interlayer spacing and hollow structures are conducive to intercalation/deintercalation and diffusion behaviors of K ion. And nitrogen doping in carbon structures can provide sufficient K ion active sites. Therefore, the KDIBs composed of expanded graphite cathode and N-AHCSs anode deliver impressive specific capacity of 89.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and super rate performance of 72.4 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after ultra-long 2000 cycles. The results indicate that the N-AHCSs might be an excellent candidate for KDIBs anodes.",Journal of Energy Storage
Sodiophilic skeleton based on the packing of hard carbon microspheres for stable sodium metal anode without dead sodium,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesThe propensity of metallic Na dendrites from uneven electrodeposits and the low Coulombic efficiency due to the inevitable existence of “dead sodium” are crucial barriers to realizing the Na metal anode. Herein, we report a multifunctional sodiophilic skeleton based on the packing of hard carbon (HC) microspheres for stable sodium metal electrodeposition without “dead sodium”. Firstly, HC is sodiophilic substrate due to the intrinsic heteroatoms or defects which is a favor for the nucleation of Na. Secondly, silver nanoparticles electroplating on HC (Ag-HC) was adopted to boost the Na diffusion and further regulate the uniform Na metal epitaxial deposition due to well compatibility with AIMD simulation. Finally, the packing of HC microspheres provides the inner space for Na plating. Importantly, it was first found by Cryo-TEM that Na metal deposition in nanoscale is achieved by oriented attachment along [110] direction, leading to the formation of polycrystalline Na metal film on Ag-HC. Such epitaxial deposition can efficiently reduce the formation of “dead sodium” as revealed by chromatography tests, allowing the high Coulombic efficiency and good cycling stability robust kinetics. Finally, HC-Ag||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell with a low negative/positive ratio of 0.6 is firstly achieved and displays good cycling stability. This finding provides a new practical strategy without pre-plating of Na metals and demonstrates a highly reversible polycrystalline Na metal anode toward a high-energy Na-based battery.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Dual-functional hosts derived from metal-organic frameworks reduce dissolution of polyselenides and inhibit dendrite growth in a sodium-selenium battery,"© 2022Selenium-based cathodes for sodium-ion batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their high electronic conductivity and volumetric capacity compared to sulfur-based cathodes. However, the use of sodium-selenium batteries has been hindered due to the low selenium reaction activity towards sodium, rapid capacity fading caused by the shuttle effect of polyselenides, and the formation of sodium dendrites on the Na anodes. Herein, starting from the nitrogen and oxygen-containing ligands, two precursors of Ni&Zn-MOF and Zn-MOF were used to fabricate the cathode and anode, respectively. A N,O-codoped porous carbon host decorated with well-dispersed Ni single-atom catalyst was derived from the Ni&Zn-MOF for Se storage. When applied as a cathode in Na-Se batteries, this composite accelerated the reaction kinetics of Se and Na+, and at the same time weakened the Se-Se bond owing to its high adsorption to the Se8 ring, which resulted in a significant improvement of the cycle stability. Meanwhile, a dendrite-free anode was realized by using Zn-MOF derived N,O-codoped porous carbon host, which showed a strong sodiophilic ability for Na metal. As a result, the Na-Se battery employing these two composites as the cathode and anode showed an excellent cycle stability and improved safety.",Energy Storage Materials
A durable ZnS cathode for aqueous Zn-S batteries,"© 2022Traditional aqueous zinc-ion batteries suffer from an unsatisfactory energy density due to the limited specific capacity of cathode. Zn-S battery shows a high energy density due to the high theoretical capacity of S (1675 mAh g−1). However, the sluggish redox kinetics and large volume evolution hinder its practical application. To tackle these problems, we propose a nanoscale ZnS packed and connected by carbon sheath (ZnS@CF) as the cathode. By introducing iodinated thiourea as a redox mediator, the activation barrier of ZnS@CF is reduced to 1.26 V. The ZnS@CF cathode delivers an extraordinary capacity of 465 mAh gZnS−1, a high specific energy density of 274 Wh kgZnS−1 (832 Wh kgS−1) and excellent rate performance (197 mAh gZnS−1 at 9.04 C).

S-sphere/C/MoS2 composite for high-performance Lithium–Sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.With the development of energy storage systems, Lithium–Sulfur (Li–S) batteries represent an ideal choice due to extremely high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh/g−1) and energy density (2500 Wh/kg−1) of Sulfur cathode. However, it is a challenge to solve the electroconductibility of Sulfur, shuttle effect of polysulfide and volume expansion. Although tremendous works have been carried out to improve the capacity, the practical application of Li–S batteries is still hindered by low electroconductibility of Sulfur, poor cycle life and low rate performances. Herein, S-sphere/C/MoS2 composite was prepared by the melt diffusion method for the nano-sulfur host. In comparison with the large particles sublimate Sulfur, nano-sulfur particles can shorten the diffusion path of ions and facilitate the smooth diffusion of Li+ into the interior of Sulfur at high discharging current densities. Therefore, the formation of insulating Li2S2 and Li2S is delayed. Moreover, the Few-layered MoS2 can be used to achieve chemical adsorption with Lithium polysulfide (LiPS) and Carbon spheres has good electronic conductivity, thus the rate performance and the cyclic capability of Li–S batteries have been improved. The S-sphere/C/MoS2 composite exhibits an initial discharging capacity of 1016.3 mAh/g−1 at 0.1 C, and a high capacity of 753 mAh/g−1 at 1 C with a low fade rate of 0.211%. These indicate that the S-sphere/C/MoS2 composite has good electrochemical performance and is expected to be a candidate electrode for Li–S batteries industrialization in the future.",Ceramics International
Recent Advances in Solar Rechargeable Seawater Batteries Based on Semiconductor Photoelectrodes,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.With the ever-increasing demand for energy in the world, the tendency to use renewable energies has been growing rapidly. Sunlight, as an inexhaustible energy source, and the oceans, as one of the most valuable treasures on Earth, are available for free. Simultaneous exploitation of these two sources of energy and matter (sunlight and oceans) in one configuration can provide a sustainable solution for future energy supply. Among the various types of such energy storage and conversion systems, solar rechargeable seawater batteries (SRSBs) can meet this need by storing the chemical energy of seawater by receiving solar energy. SRSBs consist of two compartments: a closed compartment including a sodium metal anode in an organic liquid electrolyte, and an open compartment containing a semiconductor photoelectrode immersed in seawater, which are separated from each other by a ceramic solid electrolyte membrane. In this complex system, the photoelectrode is irradiated by sunlight, whereby electrons are excited and reach the Na metal anode after passing though the external circuit. The ceramic solid electrolyte harvests only sodium ions from seawater and transfers them to the anodic part, where the transferred ions are reduced to sodium metal atoms. At the same time, an oxygen evolution reaction takes place at the cathodic part. In this way, the battery is charged. The use of a photoelectrode in the charging process significantly increases the voltage efficiency of SRSBs to more than 90%, whereas a cell with only the seawater compartment (without a photoelectrode) will not deliver satisfactory performance. Therefore, to achieve very high efficiencies, designing an accurate system with the best components is absolutely necessary. This review focuses on the working principle of SRSBs, at the same time explaining the effect of key components on the performance and stability of SRSBs. The role of the semiconductor photoelectrode in improving the voltage efficiency of SRSBs is also described in detail, and finally strategies proposed to overcome obstacles to the commercialization of SRSBs are introduced.",Topics in Current Chemistry

High-Voltage and Intrinsically Safe Sodium Metal Batteries Enabled by Nonflammable Fluorinated Phosphate Electrolytes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Sodium metal is a promising anode for high-energy-density sodium rechargeable batteries (RSBs). However, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the Na plating/stripping process and the problem of safety hinder their practical application. Herein, we report a facile strategy for employing the fluorinated phosphate solvents to realize highly reversible Na plating/stripping and improve the safety performance. The fluorinated phosphate molecules reduce the polarity of the solvent and lower the coordination number to Na+, which makes it possible to form the anion-induced ion-solvent-coordinated (AI-ISC) structures with high reduction tolerance. Moreover, the fluorination treatment enhances the oxidation resistance of the phosphate solvent, enabling compatibility with the high-voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3(NVPF) cathode. As expected, the Na@Al//NVPF full cell with the as-prepared 0.9 M NaFSI/tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFEP) demonstrates a capacity retention of 83.4% after 200 cycles with an average CE of 99.6%.

Azo-Branched Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films as Active Separators for Superior Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Sodium-Sulfur (Na-S) batteries are outstanding for their ultrahigh capacity, energy density, and low cost, but they suffer from rapid cell capacity decay and short lifespan because of serious polysulfide shuttle and sluggish redox kinetics. Herein, we synthesize thin films of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with azobenzene side groups branched to the pore walls. The azobenzene branches deliver dual functions: (1) narrow the pore size to the sub-nanometer scale thus inhibiting the polysulfide shuttle effect and (2) act as ion-hopping sites thus promoting the Na+migration. Consequently, the Na-S battery using the COF thin film as the separator exhibits a high capacity of 1295 mA h g-1at 0.2 C and an extremely low attenuation rate of 0.036% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C. This work highlights the importance of separator design in upgrading Na-S batteries and demonstrates the possibility of functionalizable framework materials in developing high-performance energy storage systems.",ACS Nano

All rights reserved.Porous carbon derived from biomass is considered as a promising active electrode material for the next-generation energy storage systems. Herein, carbon particles with a hierarchical structure are fabricated from chitin through a facile pyrolysis/activation process, which is loaded with sulfur (S) as the cathode material in a room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery. Owing to the large specific surface area, enriched microporous structure, and nitrogen and oxygen-self-doping, the obtained carbon particles can not only provide abundant active sites for energy storage and rapid ion transport channels but also improve the utilization of S. Consequently, the S-cathode achieves an excellent cycle stability of 230 mAh g-1at a current density of 1 A g-1after 2000 cycles with a capacity retention of a94%. According to the kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculation, the unique and robust structure of carbon particles enables physical encapsulation and chemical confinement of S and polysulfides (PSs), which can strengthen Na+adsorption and diffusion. Therefore, this work established a universal technique for producing high-performance S-cathode materials, which may offer the potential for economical energy storage in RT Na-S batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials

All rights reserved.Sodium (Na) metal anode possesses abundant resource and high theoretical capacity, but is still limited by severe Na dendritic growth and thus resulting in poor cycle/safety problems. To facilitate homogeneous Na deposition during repeated stripping/plating processes, we herein report the microwave hydrothermal synthesis of Sb2S3nanorod hierarchies and demonstrate the first use of Sb2S3as a substrate to in situ construct ""sodiophilic"" nucleation sites, which efficiently promote the uniform dendrite-free Na deposition/growth.

All rights reserved.Promising binder systems with special chemical and mechanical functions are under extensive exploration to cope with serious volume change and harmful shuttle effect occurring during charge/discharge cycles of a sulfur cathode in sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries. In this aspect, sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN)/polydopamine (PDA) active materials are combined with different metalized polyacrylates (MPAAs) to result in a SPAN/PDA/MPAA binder system with peculiar morphology and superior mechanical and interfacial strengths. As the outer layer of SPAN/PDA/MPAA, MPAA can extend its long chains to interact with cathode components and, moreover, metal ions of MPAA can participate in the beneficial electron transport process. The results suggest that stability and electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathodes depend on the applied metal ions, which become better and better as the valence of metal ions change from mono (Na), di (Ca), and tri (Fe) to tetra (Ti). Cathode derived from SPAN/PDA/titanium polyacrylate (TiPAA) shows the best stability and electrochemical performance, exhibiting a rather high specific capacity of 1438 mAh g-1at 0.2 C for 100 cycles and 1271 mAh g-1at 1 C for 300 cycles.

Efficient Control of the Shuttle Effect in Sodium-Sulfur Batteries with Functionalized Nanoporous Graphenes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries (RT-NaSBs) are the evolving candidates for large-scale stationary storage because of their major benefits including double-electron redox process and the natural abundance of sodium and sulfur resources. However, their practical applications have been hampered by the poor cycling stability due to the shuttle effect. This work aims at understanding the role of heteroatom-functionalized nanoporous graphene (NPG) in preventing the shuttle effect. The density functional theory method was used to unravel important properties associated with polysulfide-NPG interactions, including binding energy, electronic density of states, charge transfer mechanism, and dissociative energy barriers of the polysulfides. The findings reveal that oxygen- and nitrogen-functionalized NPG can effectively present the shuttle effect by chemically binding to sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn) with a binding energy stronger than that between Na2Snand the common electrolyte solvents. The chemical adsorption of Na2Snon the functionalized NPG causes a semiconductor-to-metal transition, benefiting the electrical conductivity. Moreover, the functionalized NPG lowers the Na2S dissociation energy to substantially form NaS and Na, which serves as a catalyst for enhancing the redox reactions between Na and S.",ACS Applied Nano Materials
Facile Strategy for Room Temperature Knitting of Sulfur in Polybenzoxazine: A New Class of Solution Processable Copolymers,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Industrial applications of the upcoming class of high-performance biobased polybenzoxazines are currently impeded by the requirement of high polymerization temperatures. Valorization of elemental sulfur (S8), petroleum waste, has provided attractive technological opportunities. However, achieving sulfur copolymers at a low temperature remains a challenging task. Here, a unique facile synthetic strategy was adopted to form a fully sustainable solution-processable benzoxazine-sulfur copolymer via a ring-opening polymerization reaction of isoeugenol-furfurylamine (IE-fa, sourced from naturally abundant biobased feedstocks) and S8at room temperature. The IE-fa benzoxazine monomer was synthesized under neat conditions and reacted with varying percentages of S8as sodium polysulfide (Na2Sx) at unprecedented low temperatures (25 and 50 °C) under catalyst-free conditions. The covalent fixation of sulfur (90 wt %), via inverse vulcanization, within ring-opened benzoxazine resulted in an amorphous copolymer as supported by various techniques. The formation of S-rich and Bz-rich domains in the copolymers is governed by the feed-in ratio of monomers and reaction temperature. Copolymers exhibited high glass transition temperatures (10-86 °C) due to the synergistic effects induced by H-bonded ring-opened benzoxazine structures. The present work demonstrates the first example of benzoxazine as a comonomer to form low-temperature solution-processable benzoxazine sulfur benign random copolymers with mid-wave infrared transparency and may advance benzoxazine chemistry toward transparent optics.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
Flour derived porous carbon as anode for highly robust potassium-ion batteries,"Copyright © 2022 Liu, Gong and Li.Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have attracted increasing research interest because of the natural abundance and low cost of potassium. Nevertheless, lacking of suitable anode materials that can deliver high reversible capacity and long cycle life highly hinder the further development of PIBs. Here, we report a flour chemistry strategy to establish a porous phosphorus-doped carbon (PPDC) as anode for high-performance PIBs. The as-prepared PPDC with high hierarchically porous structure and rich P-doping not only offers fast transport of K+ and electrons during continuous cycling, but also affords sufficient inner space to relieve volume expansion of active electrode. Therefore, the PPDC displayed high reversible capacity, excellent cyclic stability, outstanding rate performance. These results imply a great potential for applications in the field of high-energy storage devices.",Frontiers in Energy Research
Application of heteroatom doping strategy in electrolyzed water catalytic materials,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of clean and renewable new energy to solve the shortage of fossil energy and environmental pollution is an important research direction in the future. Hydrogen energy has been regarded as a kind of future energy because of its excellent characteristics of pollution-free and high calorific value. In addition, the electrolyzed water technology can also be combined with renewable energy sources such as solar energy to achieve complete recycling of hydrogen energy. In actual production, the realization of efficient water splitting relies to a large extent on the low-cost, high-activity and durable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reaction catalysts. Recently, heteroatom-doped transition metal-based water electrolysis catalyst materials have shown excellent electrocatalytic performance and durability for HER and OER, showing great potential for replacing precious metal-based catalysts. This article reviews the application of heteroatom doping strategies in transition metal-based catalytic materials and their latest research progress. First, summarize the internal relationship of heteroatom doping strategy to the morphology and catalytic activity of electrolyzed water catalytic materials. Then, the preparation process of heteroatom-doped transition metal-based catalytic materials for water electrolysis and the reasons for the improved performance and related mechanisms are discussed.

Fabrication of Lithium Indolide and Derivates for Ion Conduction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The development of ionic conductors as solid-state electrolytes to replace the widely used liquid electrolytes could effectively solve the safety issues as well as enhance the energy density of batteries. Yet no ionic conductors to date could meet all the criteria of solid-state electrolytes for practical applications. Therefore, exploration of new materials is highly demanded. Herein, a new type of metalorganic-based materials, namely, lithium indolide and its tetrahydrofuran (THF)-coordinated derivatives, are developed and employed as fast ionic conductors. Their crystal structures are also determined. Particularly, the lithium indolide ditetrahydrofuran shows ionic conductivities of 6.28 × 10-6 and 8.27 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 110 and 150 °C, respectively. A ""neutral ligand-assisted""cation migration mechanism is proposed, where the migration of Li+ may be facilitated by the dynamic equilibrium of the neutral ligand and the large sized anions. The present idea of using metalorganic compounds coordinated with neutral ligands for fast ionic conductors provides vast opportunities for discovering new solid-state electrolytes in the future thanks to the rich chemistry of organic anions and ligands.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Dual Passivation of Cathode and Anode through Electrode-Electrolyte Interface Engineering Enables Long-Lifespan Li Metal-SPAN Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The reliability and durability of lithium metal (Li0)-sulfur batteries are largely limited by the undesired Li0plating-stripping irreversibility and the detrimental polysulfide dissolution, yet approaches that can simultaneously address the above anodic and cathodic problems are scarce. Herein, we report the stable operation of a Li0-SPAN (sulfurized polyacrylonitrile) battery via an anode-cathode dual-passivation approach. By combination of a fluorinated localized high concentration electrolyte (LHCE) and a Li3N-forming additive (TMS-N3), robust and highly conductive electrode passivation layers are formed in situ on the surface of both the Li0anode and the SPAN cathode. The resulting highly reversible, dendrite-free, and high-density Li0plating morphology enables a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4%. Advanced tender energy X-ray spectroscopy also reveals the eliminated Li2S formation and minimized polysulfide dissolution in SPAN cathodes, leading to a high capacity of 580 mAh/gSPAN and stable cycling with negligible capacity decay (0.7%) for 800 cycles. This electrode-electrolyte interphase engineering strategy has tackled the major limitations of Li-S batteries in both ether- and carbonate-based electrolyte systems and under a wide temperature range from -10 to +50 °C, thus providing insightful guidelines for the rational design of highly durable and high-energy-density Li0-S batteries.",ACS Energy Letters
Hierarchically porous carbon nanofiber binder-free electrode for high-performance lithium–sulfur batteries,"Copyright © 2022 Xiao, Li, Dai and Yang.It is still a challenge for lithium–sulfur (Li-S) batteries to possess high sulfur utilization and excellent electrochemical performances due to the low electrical conductivity and dissolution of polysulfides. To resolve these issues, a free-standing sulfur host composed of hierarchically porous carbon nanofibers (HPCNFs) has been synthesized via electrospinning technology. The HPCNFs with an interconnected and porous structure can facilitate electron transfer and electrolyte penetration. The mesopores in HPCNFs can provide high levels of sulfur loading, and the micropores can inhibit shuttle effects of the sulfur cathode during discharge and charge processes. After encapsulating a high mass of sulfur (76.4 wt%, HPCNFs@S), the electrode was directly applied as a cathode for the Li-S battery, which exhibited a high specific discharge capacity of 1,145 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 1,675 mA g−1) and maintained 787 mA h g−1 after 150 charge/discharge cycles. This work provides a new insight into optimizing the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.",Frontiers in Energy Research
"Two-dimensional ternary chalcogenides FeX2Y4 (X=Ga, In; Y= S, Se, Te): Promising materials for sustainable energy","© 2022 American Physical Society.Two-dimensional layered materials, particularly ternary chalcogenides, are promising for technological applications, as they exhibit tunable electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. Here we present detailed first-principles calculations of electronic, optical, and thermal transport properties of FeX2Y4 (X=Ga, In; Y=S, Se, Te) ternary layered chalcogenides, relevant for sustainable energy applications. We show that the monolayers, similar to bulk, are dynamically and thermally stable, as demonstrated by phonon dispersion and molecular dynamics simulations. The exfoliation energy of monolayers is comparable to graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides, suggesting possible synthesis of monolayers by mechanical exfoliation. In the hexagonal crystal structure, these materials are nonmagnetic semiconductors with varied band-gap values, that are interesting for photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and thermoelectric applications. FeGa2S4 and FeIn2S4 monolayers exhibit suitable band gaps and band-edge positions for photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction. FeGa2Se4 and FeIn2Se4 monolayers are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction. The calculated optical absorption spectra indicate that FeIn2Te4, FeIn2Se4, and FeGa2Se4 are promising photovoltaic absorbers with high spectroscopic limited maximum efficiencies of ∼ 30%, 27%, and 24.5%, respectively, comparable to existing high-performance thin-film absorber materials, such as CdTe (∼31.5%) and CuInSe2 (∼28%). The narrow band gaps and relatively low room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of FeGa2Te4 (11.00 W/mK) and FeIn2Te4 (8.84 W/mK) monolayers suggest potential applications in thermoelectrics. We thereby propose FeX2Y4 ternary layered chalcogenides as promising materials for sustainable energy applications due to their suitable electronic, optical, and thermal properties.",Physical Review Materials
Tug-of-War in the Selection of Materials for Battery Technologies,"© 2022 by the authors.Batteries are the heart and the bottleneck of portable electronic systems. They power electronics and determine the system run time, with the size and volume determining factors in their design and implementation. Understanding the material properties of the battery components—anode, cathode, electrolyte, and separator—and their interaction is necessary to establish selection criteria based on their correlations with the battery metrics: capacity, current density, and cycle life. This review studies material used in the four battery components from the perspective and the impact of seven ions (Li (Formula presented.), Na (Formula presented.), K (Formula presented.), Zn (Formula presented.), Ca (Formula presented.), Mg (Formula presented.), and Al (Formula presented.)), employed in commercial and research batteries. In addition, critical factors of sustainability of the supply chains—geographical raw materials origins vs. battery manufacturing companies and material properties (Young’s modulus vs. electric conductivity)—are mapped. These are key aspects toward identifying the supply chain vulnerabilities and gaps for batteries. In addition, two battery applications, smartphones and electric vehicles, in light of challenges in the current research, commercial fronts, and technical prospects, are discussed. Bringing the next generation of batteries necessitates a transition from advances in material to addressing the technical challenges, which the review has powered.",Batteries
Designing Hollow Carbon Sphere with Hierarchal Porous for Na-S Systems with Ultra-Long Cycling Stabilities,"© 2022 by the authors.Captured by the low-cost and high theoretical specific capacity, Na-S systems have garnered much attention. However, their intermediate products (dissolved polysulfide) are always out of control. Considering the excellent space confinements and conductivity, they have been regarded as promising candidates. Herein, the hollow spheres with suitable thickness shell (~20 nm) are designed as hosting materials, accompanied by in-depth complexing. Benefitting from the abundant micro-pores (mainly about conical-type and slits-type pores < 1.0 nm), the active S4 molecules are successfully filled in the pores through vacuum tube sealing technology, effectively avoiding the process from solid S8 to liquid Na2S6. As cathode for Na-S systems, their capacity could remain at 920 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C after 100 cycles. Even at 10.0 C, the capacity still remained at about 310 mAh g−1 after 7000 cycles. Supported by the detailed kinetic behaviors, the improvement of ions diffusion behaviors is noted, bringing about the effective thorough redox reactions. Moreover, the enhanced surface-controlling behaviors further induces the evolution of rate properties. Therefore, their stable phase changing is further confirmed through in situ resistances. Thus, the work is anticipated to offer significant design for hosting carbon materials and complexing manners.",Molecules
Humidity-Induced Degradation of Lithium-Stabilized Sodium-Beta Alumina Solid Electrolytes,"© 2022 by the authors.Sodium-beta alumina is a solid-state electrolyte with outstanding chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical properties. Sodium polyaluminate is successfully employed in established Na–S and Na–NiCl2 cell systems. It is a promising candidate for all-solid-state sodium batteries. However, humidity affects the performance of this solid electrolyte. In this work, the effect of humidity on disk-shaped samples of Li-stabilized sodium-beta alumina stored in three different environments is quantified. We used impedance analysis and additional characterizations to investigate the consequences of the occurring degradation, namely ion exchange and subsequent buildup of surface layers. Sodium-beta alumina’s ionic conductivity gradually deteriorates up to two orders of magnitude. This is due to layers developed superficially during storage, while its fracture strength of 240 MPa remains unaffected. Changes in microstructure, composition, and cycle life of Na|BASE|Na cells highlight the importance of proper storage conditions: In just one week of improper storage, the critical current density collapsed from the maximum of 9.1 mA cm−2, one of the highest values reported for sodium-beta alumina, to 1.7 mA cm−2 at 25 °C. The results validate former observations regarding sodium-beta alumina’s moisture sensitivity and suggest how to handle sodium-beta alumina used in electrochemical cell systems.",Batteries
Batteries and Hydrogen Storage: Technical Analysis and Commercial Revision to Select the Best Option,"© 2022 by the authors.This paper aims to analyse two energy storage methods—batteries and hydrogen storage technologies—that in some cases are treated as complementary technologies, but in other ones they are considered opposed technologies. A detailed technical description of each technology will allow to understand the evolution of batteries and hydrogen storage technologies: batteries looking for higher energy capacity and lower maintenance, while hydrogen storage technologies pursuing better volumetric and gravimetric densities. Additionally, as energy storage systems, a mathematical model is required to know the state of charge of the system. For this purpose, a mathematical model is proposed for conventional batteries, for compressed hydrogen tanks, for liquid hydrogen storage and for metal hydride tanks, which makes it possible to integrate energy storage systems into management strategies that aim to solve the energy balance in plants based on hybrid energy storage systems. From the technical point of view, most batteries are easier to operate and do not require special operating conditions, while hydrogen storage methods are currently functioning at the two extremes (high temperatures for metal and complex hydrides and low temperatures for liquid hydrogen or physisorption). Additionally, the technical comparison made in this paper also includes research trends and future possibilities in an attempt to help plan future policies.",Energies
Will lithium-sulfur batteries be the next beyond-lithium ion batteries and even much better?,"© 2022 The Authors. InfoMat published by UESTC and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are undoubtedly the current working-horse in almost all portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, and even large-scale stationary energy storage. Given the problems faced by LIBs, a big question arises as to which battery(ies) would be the “Beyond LIBs” batteries. Among the front-runners, lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been extensively pursued owing to their intrinsically high energy density and extremely low cost. Despite the steady and sometimes exciting progress reported on sulfur chemistry and cell performance at laboratory scales over the past decade, one of the major bottlenecks is the poor cyclability. In this perspective, we examine the key challenges and opportunities faced by LSBs, as well as approaches at the materials, electrode/electrolyte and cell integration levels that can be taken to transform LSBs from a front-runner to a real leading champion in the pursuit of the “Beyond LIBs”. While the key new mechanistic insights are very important, we propose a set of the near-future research directions for both the liquid and solid state LSBs, where the currently on-going parallel pursuits of both liquid and solid LSBs will be converging. The “liquid current” will gradually be taken over by “solid future” in the expected LSBs commercialization in the coming decade. (Figure presented.).",InfoMat

"Electrochemical energy storage devices under particular service environments: Achievements, challenges, and perspective","© 2022 Author(s).With the increasing exhaustion of the traditional fossil energy and ongoing enhanced awareness of environment protection, research works on electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices have been indispensable. Now, a significant amount of works (design and fabrication of electrode materials, electrolytes, separators, etc.) devoted to improving energy and power density, safety, and service life of EES devices are under way to meet the demand for various applications. However, besides the intrinsic factors, the service environments of EES devices, such as ultra-low or ultra-high temperatures, external magnetic field, external stress, severe radiation, and other factors (electric field, light, etc.) in practical applications, will greatly affect their performance, particularly when applied to aerospace, submarine, polar scientific research, and so on. Yet, research works on EES devices in the extreme environments are limited, and enormous efforts are highly needed to overcome the existing fundamental and technological barriers. Herein, we mainly focus on the EES devices under particular service environments.

On the other hand, a summary of recent progress in EES devices under particular service environments, including systematic experiments and simulations, is provided along with the well-established strategies/methodologies toward enhanced electrochemical properties under these external environments. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are proposed. The review is of enormous significance for the development of advanced EES devices especially under particular service environments.",Applied Physics Reviews
Designing Cathodes and Cathode Active Materials for Solid-State Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Energy Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Solid-state batteries (SSBs) currently attract great attention as a potentially safe electrochemical high-energy storage concept.

This perspective, gives a brief overview of the required properties and possible challenges for inorganic CAMs employed in SSBs, and describes state-of-the art solutions. In particular, the issue of tailoring CAMs is structured into challenges arising on the cathode-, particle-, and interface-level, related to microstructural, (chemo-)mechanical, and (electro-)chemical interplay of CAMs with SEs, and finally guidelines for future CAM development for SSBs are proposed.",Advanced Energy Materials
The Future for Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries: From Persisting Issues to Promising Solutions and Practical Applications,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries are emerging as promising candidates for stationary energy-storage systems, due to their high energy density, resource abundance, and environmental benignity. A better understanding of RT-Na/S batteries in the view of the whole battery components is of essential importance for fundamental research and practical applications. In particular, the components other than sulfur cathodes in preventing the migration of polysulfides and accelerating the reaction kinetics have been greatly overlooked. Such a biased research trend is also adverse to the broader applications for RT-Na/S batteries, which have long been ignored in previous reviews. Herein, approaches to the historical progress toward practical RT-Na/S batteries through a “teamwork” perspective are comprehensively summarized, and balanced research trends are encouraged to enable practical RT-Na/S batteries. In the meantime, the persisting issues, promising solutions, and practical applications of advanced sulfur host design, Na metal anode protection, electrolyte optimization, separator modification, and binder engineering are clearly emphasized. Finally, the device-scale evaluation in practical parameters and advanced characterization tools are thoroughly provided. This review aims to provide the “teamwork” perspective on the whole-cell design and fundamental guidelines that can shed light on research directions for practical RT-Na/S batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
High-Voltage Aluminium-Sulfur Batteries with Functional Polymer Membrane,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.A high-voltage aluminium-sulfur (Al-S) battery is developed by employing the reversible electrochemical oxidation of S, favoring a high discharge voltage of around 1.8 V (vs Al3+/Al). The reversible multiple-electron transformation between positive- and negative-valence S compounds is further realized for activating a high-capacity Al-S battery. The formation of sulfur chlorides as charge products of S, including S2Cl2(l) as the dominant one, has been clearly identified. Benefiting from a functional polymer membrane infiltrated with AlCl3/acetamide electrolyte, which can suppress unwanted electrolyte reactions, restrict the shuttling of sulfur chlorides across the separator, and stabilize the Al anode against degradation, the Al-S battery can deliver largely enhanced performance, with a capacity of 861 mAh g−1, capacity retentions of 92.1%/79.0% within 50/200 cycles, and durability of 490 cycles.

Efficient Sodium Storage in Selenium Electrodes Achieved by Selenium Doping and Copper Current Collector Induced Displacement Redox Mechanisms,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Selenium (Se), with its high specific volume capacity and high electronic and superior kinetics, is considered a promising electrode material with promising applications. However, the solvation and shuttle effects of polyselenides hinder their further application. The selenium/nitrogen-doped hollow porous carbon spheres (Se/NHPCs) are obtained using the sacrificial template and in situ gas-phase selenization methods. The Se species are doped into carbon matrixes in an adjustable amount to form Se-C(N) bonds during this process. Density functional theory calculations show that the Se-C(N) bond enhances the charge transfer between Na2Se and carbon matrix and binding energy, which improves rate performance and cycling stability. As expected, Se/NHPCs electrode exhibit high reversible capacity (480 mAh g–1 at 0.5 A g–1 after 200 cycles) and rate performance (311 mAh g–1 at 5 A g–1) as the anode for sodium-ion batteries. A series of ex situ characterization results show that Cu2Se produced by copper current collector induction is effective in the adsorption of polyselenides while enhancing the electrode conductivity. Since the lattice structures of Cu2Se and Na2Se are similar, this displacement reaction that does not involve lattice reconfiguration provides an effective strategy for the preparation of high-performance and low-cost electrode materials.",Advanced Functional Materials
Insight into the Fast-Rechargeability of a Novel Mo1.5W1.5Nb14O44 Anode Material for High-Performance Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Wadsley–Roth phased niobates are promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, while their inherently low electrical conductivity still limits their rate-capability. Herein, a novel doped Mo1.5W1.5Nb14O44 (MWNO) material is facilely prepared via an ionothermal-synthesis-assisted doping strategy. The detailed crystal structure of MWNO is characterized by neutron powder diffraction and aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscope, unveiling the full occupation of Mo6+-dopant at the t1 tetrahedral site. In half-cells, MWNO exhibits enhanced fast-rechargeability. The origin of the improved performance is investigated by ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, density functional theory (DFT) computation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, revealing that bandgap narrowing improves the electrical conductivity of MWNO. Furthermore, operando X-ray diffraction elucidates that MWNO exhibits a typical solid-solution phase conversion-based lithium-ion insertion/extraction mechanism with reversible structural evolution during the electrochemical reaction. The boosted lithium-ion diffusivity of MWNO, due to the Mo6+/W6+ doping effect, is confirmed by a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique and DFT. With the simultaneously enhanced electrical conductivity and lithium-ion diffusivity, MWNO successfully demonstrates its fast-rechargeability and practicality in the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4-coupled full-cells. Therefore, this work illustrates the potential of ionothermal synthesis in energy storage materials and provides a mechanistic understanding of the doping effect on improving material's electrochemical performance.",Advanced Energy Materials
Transition Metals Embedded Siloxene as Single-Atom Catalyst for Advanced Sulfur Host in Lithium–Sulfur Batteries: A Theoretical Study,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The practical applications of lithium–sulfur batteries are presently hindered by the shuttle effect, sluggish reaction kinetics, and poor electronic conductivity of sulfur. Siloxene, a new 2D nanomaterial with three types of structures (Weiss, chain like, and Kautsky), is regarded to be a promising cathode-supporting material for Li–S batteries. Herein, a series of 3d transition metal single-atom embedded siloxenes (TM-SA-siloxenes) is designed and their potential in Li–S batteries is evaluated by first-principles calculations. It is found that Weiss-siloxene shows the best polysulfide anchoring ability and lowest Gibbs free energy for the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR). Among a series of TM-SA-siloxenes, Co-SA-siloxene is identified as the optimal candidate. It shows moderate adsorption energies for polysulfides and outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for SRR and Li2S decomposition, as well as excellent electronic conductivity. It is also revealed that suitable d and p band center positions, obvious hybridization between Co–3d and S–3p orbitals, and more charge obtained from adsorbed polysulfides, contribute to the high redox kinetics of Co-SA-siloxene for the catalyzing conversion of polysulfides. These interesting results provide valuable theoretical guidance for the study of siloxene-based cathode host materials for Li–S batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials

Effect of pre-oxidation temperature and heating rate on the microstructure of lignin carbon fibers,"© 2022Lignin is a biopolymer with high carbon content, making lignin-based carbon fiber an important research direction. In the process of carbonization to prepare carbon fibers, lignin fibers are easily softened and fused, which destroys the microstructure of fibers, thereby reducing the quality of lignin-based carbon fibers. Therefore, it is non-negligible to pre-oxidize lignin fibers before carbonization to prevent fiber fusion and maintain fiber structure. Therefore, the effects of pre-oxidation temperature and heating rate on the structure of pre-oxidation lignin fibers with controllable diameter and thickness prepared by melt-blowing were studied in detail. During pre-oxidation, crosslinking and aromatization of lignin fibers occurred, and alkyl and benzene rings were mainly oxidized to form carbonyl groups. The aromatization degree of the pre-oxidized product was recorded at 280 °C and 0.25 °C/min, and the oxygen content reached 15 %–20 %, making it suitable for the preparation of bio-based carbon fibers. On this basis, carbon fibers with porous morphology can be prepared with a graphitization of 0.54 and a resistivity of 0.02 Ω cm−1. These materials are expected to be applicable in sensors, catalytic materials and other fields.",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules
Understanding the Cathode–Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The electrode–electrolyte interface is one of the major components enabling Li-ion batteries (LIBs) to function reversibly. Often, the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the anode is regarded as the key interface that determines the cycle life, capacity fade, and overall safety of batteries. There are a plethora of SEI literatures that exist; however, the cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI) remains relatively unexplored. Unlike in the case of SEI, a detailed understanding of CEI formation and its association with battery performance is not present. This review gives insight into the recent progress in understanding the CEI in LIBs. Though there is a relative dearth of literature, the CEI is generally considered as a heterogeneous multicomponent film formed due to the decomposition of electrolyte at the cathode surface. Besides understanding the thermodynamic properties and relevant kinetic reactions, one of the main challenges lies in developing and stabilizing the CEI layer due to its complex structural composition. Extensive research efforts to engineer a stable CEI are reviewed, including the use of electrolyte additives, artificial engineering, and heteroatom doping of cathode. Furthermore, promising characterization techniques and future outlook in forming a robust CEI for both existing LIB and post-LIB systems are highlighted.",Energy Technology

And asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) of NiCo2O4//activated carbon (AC) exhibit the energy density of 25.02 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 760 W kg−1. Furthermore, to investigate the impact of aging factors on the cycle life of ASCs, a new model for capacitance life prediction is established. The model takes the cycle times, temperature, current density, and potential window into account, which is based on the classic Eyring's law and the actual specific capacitance of ASCs. It forecasts that the ASCs will have a cycle life of 9750 cycles under ideal condition of 25 °C, 5 A g−1 current density, and 0–1.5 V potential range, with only a relative error of −0.09 % and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.47 %, compared to the actual life of 9759 cycles.

Diffusion mechanism in a sodium superionic sulfide-based solid electrolyte: Na11Sn2AsS12,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Recently, in all solid-state batteries, sulfide-based solid electrolytes have received increased attention due to their high ionic conductivity, good mechanical features, and better chemical stability. Therefore, in the present study, we have synthesized a novel sodium superionic conducting sulfide-based inorganic solid electrolyte (Na11Sn2AsS12) using a solid-state reaction method. The prepared solid electrolyte (Na11Sn2AsS12) is characterized by different techniques such as x-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and linear sweep voltammetry to study its various properties such as structure, surface morphology, thermal stability, dielectric properties, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical stability window for sodium ion battery (SIB) applications. The XRD analysis confirms two coexisting phases - tetragonal and cubic, with phase fractions of 0.69 and 0.31, respectively. The SEM study reveals the irregular shape and dense morphology of the solid electrolyte. On the other hand, TGA shows that the prepared solid electrolyte is suitable for high temperature battery applications.

"3-Trimethylsilyl-2-oxazolidinone, as a multifunctional additive to stabilize FEC-containing electrolyte for sodium metal batteries","© 2022 Elsevier LtdRechargeable sodium batteries have become an important complement to lithium secondary batteries and other energy devices due to their lithium-like operating mechanism and abundant sodium resources. Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) with high energy density can be applied in more aspects, but still faces more prominent challenges such as sodium dendrite growth and severe electrode-electrolyte interface reactions. Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive can effectively improve the stability of sodium metal anode due to the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interfacial (SEI) layer on sodium surface. However, the protective effect is not sufficient in suppressing sodium dendrite and corrosion of electrolyte as its easily ring-opening polymerization induced by Lewis acid (especially PF5) in carbonate electrolytes. Here, 3-Trimethylsilyl-2-oxazolidinone (TMSO) as a multifunctional additive that not only removes H2O and HF from the electrolyte, but also inhibits the decomposition of NaPF6 and improves the stability of FEC-containing electrolytes. Besides, TMSO can form a stable cathode electrolyte interfacial (CEI) layer on Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode surface, alleviating NVP cracking and structural pulverization and thus endowing the long-term cycling stability of NVP cathode with low interfacial resistance. Notably, with the optimized electrolyte, the Na||NVP metal battery exhibits stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 93.1% after 1400 cycles at room temperature and higher capacity retention of 96.6% for 270 cycles at 55 °C.",Electrochimica Acta
Recent advances in solid-state beyond lithium batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.As battery technologies are in continuous development, and especially due to the rapid growth in vehicle electrification, which requires large (e.g., 100 s of kg) battery packs, there has been a growing demand for more efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly materials. Solid-state post-lithium-ion batteries are considered a possible next-generation energy storage technology. One immediate advantage of these power sources over commercial lithium-ion batteries is the potential of solving the resource issues facing LIBs, especially as cost-effective alternatives. The second advantage is the removal of flammable liquid electrolytes. The solid electrolytes are more resistant to changes in temperature and physical damage, produce up to 80% less heat, and are able to handle more charge/discharge cycles before degradation makes them unusable. All these features point towards a longer battery life. Other immediate gains include the removal of the membrane and casing required for a liquid electrolyte. This may reduce the weight and volume of each cell, leading to an increase in the energy density of the battery. In this review, we describe recent achievements in the development of sodium, potassium, and magnesium solid-state batteries. It can be revealed that while the research community has progressed greatly towards solid-state alkali and alkaline-earth batteries, much more improvement in the room temperature ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes is required. For the practical applications of these systems, the stability and interfacial reactions of solid electrolytes should be explored in great depth.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry
Emerging low-nuclearity supported metal catalysts with atomic level precision for efficient heterogeneous catalysis,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs) have received enormous attention due to their high atom utilization efficiency, mass activity and excellent selectivity. Single-atom site catalysts (SACs) with monometal-center as the quintessential ADMCs have been extensively studied in the catalysis-related fields. Beyond SACs, novel atomically dispersed metal catalysts (NADMCs) with flexible active sites featuring two or more catalytically centers including dual-atom and triple-atom catalysts have drawn ever-increasing attention recently. Owing to the presence of multiple neighboring active sites, NADMCs could exhibit much higher activity and selectivity compared with SACs, especially in those complicated reactions with multi-step intermediates. This review comprehensively outlines the recent exciting advances on the NADMCs with emphasis on the deeper understanding of the synergistic interactions among multiple metal atoms and underlying structure–performance relationships. It starts with the systematical introduction of principal synthetic approaches for NADMCs highlighting the key issues of each fabrication method including the atomically precise control in the design of metal nuclearity, and then the state-of-the-art characterizations for identifying and monitoring the atomic structure of NADMCs are explored. Thereafter, the recent development of NADMCs in energy-related applications is systematically discussed. Finally, we provide some new insights into the remaining challenges and opportunities for the development of NADMCs. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano Research

Covalent encapsulation of sulfur in a graphene/N-doped carbon host for enhanced sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Application of emerging room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery is restrained by the poor conductivity, volume expansion of sulfur cathode and the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides in electrolytes. Herein, an N-doped two-dimensional (2D) carbon host was derived from the polydopamine coated graphene for sulfur storage. Different from the conventional used melt-diffusion method to integrate sulfur on graphene layer physically, we employed a vapor-infiltration method to realize the homogenous incorporation of sulfur in the graphene-based host via C-Sx-C bond. A polydopamine-derived N-doped carbon layer was further coated on graphene to confine the high-temperature-induced gas-phase sulfur, which effectively increase the covalently bonded sulfur content in the host. Moreover, based on Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurement, the C-S bonds are mainly formed beside N-doped carbon, being well explained by the stronger interaction between N-doped carbon and S4 (sulfur vapor) than that of pure carbon from density functional theory (DFT) calculation results. When tested as a cathode for RT Na-S battery, the obtained N-doped graphene/sulfur cathode shows superior cycle stability.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Nonflammable, robust and flexible electrolytes enabled by phosphate coupled polymer–polymer for Li-metal batteries","© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Liquid organic electrolytes commonly employed in commercial Li-ion batteries suffer from safety issues such as flammability and explosions. Replacing liquid electrolytes with nonflammable electrolytes has become increasingly attractive in the development of safe, high-energy Li-metal batteries (LMBs). In this work, nonflammable, robust, and flexible composite polymer–polymer electrolytes (PPEs) were successfully fabricated by flame-retardant solution casting with polyimide (PI) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The optimized nonflammable PPEs (e.g., PPE-50) demonstrate not only good mechanical properties (i.e., a high tensile strength of 29.6 MPa with an elongation at break of 87.2%), but also high Li salts dissolubility, the former of which ensures the suppression of Li dendrites, while the latter further improves the ionic conductivity (∼1.86 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C). The resulting symmetric cells (Li|PPE-50|Li) offer excellent Li stripping and plating stability for 1000 h at 0.5 mA cm−2/0.25 mAh cm−2 and 600 h at 2.0 mA cm−2/1.0 mAh cm−2. In addition, the LiFePO4|PPE-50|Li half cells show high cycling performance (e.g., a reversible discharge capacity of 135.9 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 1C) and rate capability (e.g., 117.2 mAh g−1 at 4C). The PPE-50 is also compatible with a high-voltage cathode (e.g., LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2), and the resulting batteries demonstrate long-term cycling stability with a high cut-off voltage of 4.5 V vs. Li/Li+. Because of the incorporation of a mechanically robust and thermally stable PI, a polar PVDF, and flame-retardant trimethyl phosphate (TMP) within PPEs, as well as the coordination between Li salts and TMP, and the interaction between Li salts and polymers (especially between Li bis(oxalato)borate) and PI, as well as the bis(oxalato)borate anion and PI), PPEs show great potential for practical and high-energy LMBs without safety concerns.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
A two-step strategy for constructing stable gel polymer electrolyte interfaces for long-life cycle lithium metal batteries,"© 2022 The Chinese Ceramic SocietyDue to the high reactivity between the lithium metal and traditional organic liquid electrolyte, the reaction of lithium metal electrode is usually uneven and there are also unexpected side reactions. Therefore, construction of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is highly essential to improve the performance of lithium metal anode. Herein, a sandwich-like gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is accurately prepared by in-situ polymerization of Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber membrane with trihydroxymethylpropyl trimethylacrylate (TMPTMA) and 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA). The resulting GPE with a tightly cross-linked gel skeleton exhibits high ionic conductivity and electrochemical window of 5.6 V versus Li/Li+. In particular, the pretreatment of Li metal anode can improve the interfacial wettability, and the synergy of the chemically pretreated Li metal anode surface and the GPE can electrochemically in situ generate SEI with compositionally stable and fluorine-rich inorganic components. Owing to these unique advantages, the interfacial compatibility between the GPE and lithium metal is greatly improved. Meanwhile, the formed SEI can inhibit the formation of lithium dendrites, and decomposition of GPE would be alleviated. The assembled Li-FEC|GPE|LiFePO4 full cell shows a high initial discharge capacity of 157.1 mA h g−1, and maintains a capacity retention of 92.3% after 100 cycles at 0.2C.",Journal of Materiomics
Ultrafine Fe3N nanocrystals coupled with N doped 3D porous carbon networks induced atomically dispersed Fe for superior sodium ion storage,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdFor conversion type Li/Na-ion batteries anode materials, constructing the nanocomposite with enough interface interaction is of great importance for enhancing the electrochemical reaction kinetics and keeping the integrity of the electrode structure even after a long-term cycle at a high current density. In addition, the highly reversible conversion of discharge product also plays a vital role in prolonging the cycling life of conversion type anode materials for Li/Na-ion batteries. In this work, a composite of isolated ultrafine Fe3N nanocrystals (<15 nm) strongly coupled with N doped 3D porous carbon networks (N-3DPCN) were successfully fabricated via salt template-assisted calcination strategy. Both experimental results and theoretical simulations have validated that the powerful interface interaction between ultrafine Fe3N nanocrystals (<15 nm) and N-3DPCN is bound up with the N-doping in 3DPCN, and the atomically dispersed metal Fe in the N-3DPCN (SAFe-N@3DPCN) formed during the discharge process of Fe3N can catalyze the reversible conversion of discharge product Na3N. Benefited from these advantages, the as-constructed Fe3N@N-3DPCN composite delivers excellent Li/Na ion storage performance. This work shed light on the composite design of conversion-type materials and carbon materials for applications in energy storage fields and beyond.",Carbon
Inhibiting the cyclization of PAN by carboxyl groups for carbon nanofibers with balanced Na+ storage performance and ICE,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Hard carbon nanofiber derived from electrospinning polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is regarded as the promising electrode featuring the low-cost and simple preparation advantages, while it possesses the low plateau capacity, limiting its application as anode for the sodium ion (Na+) storage technologies. The main obstacle is that the cyclization of PAN during stabilization leads to the formation of ordered carbon structures. Herein, nanofibers anodes with disordered structures and abundant internal nanopores are fabricated by using carboxyl-functionalized PAN. The cyan (–CN) of PAN turns to sodium carboxylate (–COONa) during the hydrolysis process in NaOH solution, so that the cyclization in stabilization process is limited and realizing disordered carbon structures. Meanwhile, the formation of –COONa can lead to hard carbon with abundant internal pores, thereby resulting in an extended plateau region during discharging. The optimized PCNFs2-700-1400 anode delivers a satisfactory reversible capacity of 286 mAh/g at 0.02 A/g with an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 73%. The larger plateau capacity of 183 mAh/g is ascribed to the filling of Na+ in the internal pores and insertion in the pseudo-graphitic. This strategy is expected to help enhance the understanding of Na+ storage “adsorption-insertion-pore filling” mechanism in PAN-derived hard carbon.",Applied Surface Science

High-sulfur-doped hard carbon for sodium-ion battery anodes with large capacity and high initial coulombic efficiency,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.As one of the most promising potential anodes for sodium ion batteries, hard carbon suffers from low specific capacity, which seriously hinders its further application. In the present work, a novel S-doped hard carbon material (SHC) with an ultrahigh S content of 15.91% is designed by a simple sulfonation treatment of terthiophene. Ex situ X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffractometer and Transmission Electron Microscope results demonstrate that the S atoms supply redox reaction sites with Na+ and lead to the formation of NaxS, thus endowing the SHC with superior Na storage performance. The SHC has a large reversible capacity of 777 mA h g−1, and it shows good cycling stability that a high capacity of 758 mA h g−1 is maintained after 1000 cycles, with no dramatic capacity loss. Meanwhile, it is notable that SHC-500 has a surprisingly high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 84.4%, demonstrating good potential in practical use. Kinetics analysis reveals that the S atoms store Na through a dominant fast surface reaction, and then the SHC has good high-rate performance, e.g., a capacity of 353 mA h g−1 is delivered at a large current density of 10 A g−1",Sustainable Energy and Fuels
Deciphering Fast Ion Transport in Glasses: A Case Study of Sodium and Silver Vitreous Sulfides,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.High-capacity solid-state batteries are promising future products for large-scale energy storage and conversion. Sodium fast ion conductors including glasses and glass ceramics are unparalleled materials for these applications. Rational design and tuning of advanced sodium sulfide electrolytes need a deep insight into the atomic structure and dynamics in relation with ion-transport properties. Using pulsed neutron diffraction and Raman spectroscopy supported by first-principles simulations, we show that preferential diffusion pathways in vitreous sodium and silver sulfides are related to isolated sulfur Siso, that is, the sulfur species surrounded exclusively by mobile cations with a typical stoichiometry of M/Siso ≈ 2. The Siso/Stot fraction appears to be a reliable descriptor of fast ion transport in glassy sulfide systems over a wide range of ionic conductivities and cation diffusivities. The Siso fraction increases with mobile cation content x, tetrahedral coordination of the network former and, in case of thiogermanate systems, with germanium disulfide metastability and partial disproportionation, GeS2 → GeS + S, leading to the formation of additional sulfur, transforming into Siso. A research strategy enabling to achieve extended and interconnected pathways based on isolated sulfur would lead to glassy electrolytes with superior ionic diffusion.",Inorganic Chemistry
Polydopamine as an interfacial layer to enhance mechanical and adhesive properties of the active materials in a sulfur cathode of sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Author(s)Room temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries are promising devices for energy storage system, but for practical applications volume expansion and detrimental shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode should be solved. Herein, we introduced a novel sulfur cathode system of using polydopamine (PDA) as an interlayer in between sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) active material and pullulan-graft-sodium polyacrylic acid (PuA) binder. Active NH and OH functional groups of PDA interlayer serve as facile hydrogen bonding (H bonding) and/or chemical reaction sites to various functional groups of SPAN and PuA, thus forming an intimately packed SPAN/PDA/PuA composite with sufficient mechanical and interfacial adhesive strengths to survive from the dimensional variation of sulfur cathode during charge/discharge cycling. Moreover, various functional groups of the SPAN/PDA/PuA are capable of absorbing polysulfides to limit the shuttle effect. Sulfur cathode derived from SPAN/PDA/PuA exhibited a high specific capacity of 1340 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. Without the PDA interlayer, sulfur cathode derived from SPAN/PuA exhibits a much lower capacity of 790 mAh g−1. The role of PDA in promoting the stability and electrochemical performance of sulfur cathode is thus verified in this study.",Chemical Engineering Journal Advances
An indirect detection strategy-assisted self-cleaning electrochemical platform for in-situ and pretreatment-free detection of endogenous H2S from sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB),"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can be adopted as an indicator for the indirect detection of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB), which considered to be closely related to pipeline corrosion and human intestinal health. Unfortunately, the in-situ detection of endogenous H2S from SRB in the complex culture medium still faces huge challenges. Besides nonspecific adsorption from the culture medium of SRB, the problem of electrode passivation by produced elemental sulfur during electrochemical detection processes of H2S cannot be ignored. To address these challenges, herein a synergistic sensing platform based on self-cleaning electrode interface and indirect detection strategy (specific H2S-induced chemical reaction) is developed. This indirect sensing strategy-assisted self-cleaning electrochemical platform showed a relatively good linear response toward H2S in the range of 0.5 − 5 μM, and the corresponding limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be 5.09 nM. More importantly, the satisfactory self-cleaning electrode interface in indirect detection system (with only a 4.10% decrease in signal over 50 electrochemical repeated cycles) showed the electrode surface not being disturbed by elemental sulfur. Furthermore, this good selectivity of the indirect detection strategy in combination with the reproducibility, stability, and antifouling activity of the self-cleaning interface, enabled a synergistic sensing platform to detect H2S directly in the complex culture medium of SRB without time-consuming sample pretreatments. Moreover, this proposed construction strategy of synergetic sensing platform could be explored to other endogenous molecules in complex environment based on different antifouling materials and specific reactions.",Journal of Hazardous Materials
Enhanced capacitive deionization by rGO@PEI/MoS2 nanocomposites with rich heterostructures,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Heterostructure electrodes prepared from the nanocomposite rGO/MoS2 have become one of the hot spots for capacitive deionization (CDI) research due to their excellent electrochemical properties. However, during the preparation process, the electrostatic repulsion by the electronegativity of graphene oxide (GO) and MoS2 precursor (molybdate ion) led to the undesirable combination of rGO and MoS2. Only a small amount of MoS2 existed on the surface of rGO, which was not conducive to the formation of heterostructures between rGO and MoS2. In this work, GO was modified by the positively charged polyethyleneimine (PEI), forming the GO@PEI with positively charged surfaces. Due to the electrostatic interaction with the precursors (Molybdate ions) of MoS2, the rGO@PEI/MoS2 composites with rich heterostructures were successfully prepared. As result, the rGO@PEI/MoS2 composites exhibited high specific capacitance, excellent cycle stability, and enhanced desalination performance. The rGO@PEI/MoS2 had a maximum specific capacitance of 212.53F/g, which was a 45% improvement over rGO/MoS2. The maximum electro-adsorption of the rGO@PEI/MoS2 electrode was about 24.13 mg/g with pole plate spacing of 1 mm at 1.0 V. The excellent electrochemical properties and desalination capability of the rGO@PEI/MoS2 composite were attributed to the synergistic effect generated by the rich heterostructure. The rich heterostructure formed between rGO and MoS2 through van der Waals forces and chemical bonding (Mo-N-C) perfectly combined their advantages and counteracted their disadvantages.",Separation and Purification Technology

Oxygen-Plasma-Treated Fe-N-C Catalysts with Dual Binding Sites for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Enhanced polysulfide conversion kinetics is essential for realizing lithium-sulfur batteries with high energy density and rate performance and promising cyclability. The modification of the local atomic structure of MNxactive sites in single-atom M-N-C catalysts was proposed to improve their electrocatalytic activity for demanding reactions by fine-tuning the interaction with reaction intermediates. Here, we demonstrate that engineering the binding geometry of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by introducing dual binding sites improves the LiPS conversion kinetics. We use mild oxygen plasma treatment to introduce oxygen species into the Fe-N-C catalyst. The plasma-treated Fe-N-C (pFeNG) catalyst with dual sulfiphilic (mononuclear iron) and lithiophilic (oxygen) binding sites has a lower polysulfide decomposition energy, especially for Li2S redox, which is known to be the most sluggish process. The pFeNG cathode shows significant improvement, especially at high C rates (916.3 mA h g-1at 5C), with promising cycling performance.",ACS Energy Letters
A Heterogeneous Oxide Enables Reversible Calcium Electrodeposition for a Calcium Battery,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Multivalent rechargeable metal batteries offer a safer, more sustainable, and higher energy density alternative to lithium-ion batteries, though several challenges remain. Recent demonstrations of room-temperature reversible electrodeposition and dissolution of Ca metal indicate that it is possible to stabilize metallic Ca anodes with spontaneously formed solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). However, further progress toward the goal of an energy-efficient, long cycle-life Ca anode requires correlating interphase identity with electrode performance. In this work, we demonstrate that the SEI formed from calcium borohydride solvated in tetrahydrofuran, an electrolyte that supports reversible Ca deposition, is a compositionally and structurally heterogeneous oxide, sufficiently thin to support Ca2+ cation transmission while stabilizing Ca from corrosive loss during long-term electrolyte contact. The significant advance demonstrated here is that ionically nonconductive materials, like calcium oxide, can form cation-transmissive interphases in which conductivity can be tailored through control of heterogeneity, providing an approach for stabilizing reactive metal electrodes.",ACS Energy Letters
Assessment on the Stable and High-Capacity Na−Se Batteries with Carbonate Electrolytes,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Factors affecting proper functioning of Na−Se system are investigated focusing on the polyselenide formation in ether- and carbonate-based electrolytes. To do so, Se cathode is prepared by ball milling with commercial carbon and selenium powders. It is revealed that the soluble polyselenide species form in ether while no signature in carbonates proven by the in-situ cyclic voltammetry and ex-situ ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy measurements as well as monitoring self-discharge behaviours. Different Se discharge mechanism is also highlighted by staircase potentio electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (SPEIS) that is an impedance measurement applied to each potential step. Volume expansion is targeted using different types of binders in which carboxyl methylcellulose-styrene butadiene rubber (CMC-SBR) delivers the highest reversible capacity and the best rate performance resulting from its high adhesion strength. To further improve the performances, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is used as a film forming additive that preserves Na metal integrity proven by the Na−Na symmetric cells and voltage relaxation upon cycling. As a whole, binders and electrolyte compositions are found to be the two crucial factors to obtain stable and high-capacity Na−Se cells. This study underlines that much effort needs to be put on the strategies to overcome volume expansion than that of Se confinement into porous cathode.",ChemElectroChem

In this study, a novel honeycomb-like nitrogen-doped porous carbon/graphitized carbon nitride (HPCG) heterojunction nanocatalyst is prepared using truncated rhombic dodecahedral zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (TRD-ZIF-8) nanoparticles as a synthesis template. A unique hierarchical porous structure and abundant active catalytic sites of HPCG can effectively immobilize polysulfides, accelerate long-chain polysulfide conversion and promote Li2S nucleation, thereby inhibiting the shuttle effect. HPCG cells exhibit good rate performance and excellent high-rate cycling stability with only 0.073% capacity decay per cycle after 1000 cycles at 5 C. Specifically, a cell with a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 9.6 µL mg−1 demonstrates stable operation over 300 cycles at 1C.

Herein, we report the synthesis of phosphorus-rich rod-like cobalt disphosphide with a carbon shell (CoP2@C) by thermal decomposition of polydopamine-coated cobalt oxalate in the presence of sodium hypophosphite. The as-obtained CoP2@C anode delivered a high sodium-ion storage capacity of ∼550 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1 due to its multi pseudocapacitive and intercalation charge storage mechanisms. These preliminary results show that CoP2@C hold a great promise for developing high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices based on sodium-ion as the charge carrier.",Electrochimica Acta
Zr doped NASICON-type LATP glass-ceramic as a super-thin coating onto deoxidized carbon wrapped CNT-S cathode for lithium-sulphur battery,"© 2022Rechargeable lithium–sulphur (Li–S) battery is one of the best candidates for the next generation of high-energy-storage systems. However, widespread application of Li–S battery is being restricted by the solubility and migration of the reaction intermediates in both discharge and charge processes. In this paper, we report a dual-phase electrolyte-based Li-S battery with high capacity and safety performance. With a lithium superionic conductor coating on the deoxidized carbon wrapped carbon nanotube-sulphur (CNT-S) cathode, there is no obvious decay in capacity during the long-term cycles for the assembled dual-phase electrolyte-based Li–S battery, and the discharge capacities achieved after the fortieth cycle are observed to return back to the level of the initial cycle. The sub-micron crystallized NASICON-type glass-ceramic powders with high purity are synthesized by a modified sol-gel method. Compared to the best value reported recently, an order of magnitude enhancement in total conductivity under room temperature is obtained in the doped sample using the process. By introducing this super high lithium-ion conductor to the particular battery architecture and combining it with the developed high-performance positive electrode, the assembled dual-phase electrolyte-based Li–S battery exhibits an efficient utilization of active materials and outstanding high-rate discharge ability, which is promising for possible commercial exploitation and practical applications.",Electrochimica Acta
Three-dimensional Au/carbon nanotube-graphene foam hybrid nanostructure for dendrite free sodium metal anode with long cycle stability,"© 2022Sodium metal anode has been attracting widely research attention due to its large capacity and low electrode potential as the anode of sodium-ion batteries. However, the uncontrollable growth of Na dendrite is one of the critical issues for its real applications. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure composed of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) supported on 3D carbon nanotube-graphene foam (3D CNT-GF) was designed and fabricated as the host of sodium metal anode. Na@3D Au/CNT-GF anode can deliver a Coulombic efficiency of 99.14% and stably cycle for 2600 h at 1 mA cm−2 with 1 mAh cm−2. It can cycle for 300 h at 5 mA cm−2 with 1 mAh cm−2. Detailed results indicate that its excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the unique macroporous structure and sodiophilic surface formed by Au NPs guiding the uniform sodium metal deposition enabled a dendrite-free morphology investigated by the ex-situ SEM and in-situ optical microscopy. At last, a full cell was assembled with Na@3D Au/CNT-GF as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)3@C as the cathode. It can deliver a capacity of 84.6 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 200 cycles. Our results demonstrate that 3D Au/CNT-GF is a promising sodium metal anode host.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
Electrically reading a light-driven molecular switch on 2D-Ti3C2Tx MXene via molecular engineering: towards responsive MXetronics,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The contemporary digital revolution, which demands for miniaturized electronics, has prompted the search for molecule-based nanomaterials that handle some of the computational logic functions—which relates the concept of zeros (0) and ones (1) in binary code—reached by mainstream silicon-based semiconductor technology. Herein, the feasibility of emerging 2D transition metal carbide (MXene) derivatives to write, erase and readout bistable molecular switches has been elucidated. As a first demonstration of applicability, 2D-Ti3C2Tx MXene has been covalently functionalized with an optically active molecule as azobenzene (AZO), in which the photo-driven inputs of the AZO isomerization (E-AZO@Ti3C2Tx ↔ Z-AZO@Ti3C2Tx) resulted in two distinguished electrical states when it was immobilized in an emerging 3D-printed transducer.

Sodium Borates: Expanding the Electrolyte Selection for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Angewandte Chemie International Edition published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising grid-level storage technology due to the abundance and low cost of sodium. The development of new electrolytes for SIBs is imperative since it impacts battery life and capacity. Currently, sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) is used as the benchmark salt, but is highly hygroscopic and generates toxic HF. This work describes the synthesis of a series of sodium borate salts, with electrochemical studies revealing that Na[B(hfip)4]⋅DME (hfip=hexafluoroisopropyloxy, OiPrF) and Na[B(pp)2] (pp=perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4) have excellent electrochemical performance. The [B(pp)2]− anion also exhibits a high tolerance to air and water. Both electrolytes give more stable electrode-electrolyte interfaces than conventionally used NaPF6, as demonstrated by impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, they give greater cycling stability and comparable capacity to NaPF6 for SIBs, as shown in commercial pouch cells.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition

However, most of the previous studies have been limited by applying pure oxygen in the cathode, without taking into consideration the effect of the catalyst, which plays a significant role in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Adsorption of oxygen on (110) Na-MO2is investigated, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which is important in the discharging and charging of Na-air batteries.

"Structural, Electronic, Mechanical, and Thermodynamic Properties of Na Deintercalation from Olivine NaMnPO4: First-Principles Study","© 2022 by the authors.The impact of Na atom deintercalation on olivine NaMnPO4 was investigated in a first-principle study for prospective use as cathode materials in Na-ion batteries. Within the generalized gradient approximation functional with Hubbard (U) correction, we used the plane-wave pseudopotential approach. The calculated equilibrium lattice constants are within 5% of the experimental data. The difference in equilibrium cell volumes for all deintercalated phases was only 6%, showing that NaMPO4 is structurally more stable. The predicted voltage window was found to be between 3.997 and 3.848 V. The Na1MnPO4 and MnPO4 structures are likely to be semiconductors, but the Na0.75MnPO4, Na0.5MnPO4, and Na0.25MnPO4 structures are likely to be metallic. Furthermore, all independent elastic constants for NaxMPO4 structures were shown to meet the mechanical stability requirement of the orthorhombic lattice system.",Materials
Unraveling the Anchoring Effect of MXene-Supported Single Atoms as Cathodes for Aluminum-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 ACS Materials Letters. All right reserved.As an alternative energy storage system, the stable cycle and high-rate performance of aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) batteries are increasingly affected by the dissolution of intermediate Al polysulfide (Al2Sn) into the electrolyte. Introducing anchoring materials that can promote Al2Snconversion is an effective way to solve this problem. However, the lack of an interaction mechanism between Al2Snand anchoring materials hinders the design of anchoring materials. Here, we used single-atom-loaded MXene (SA@MXene) as a representative anchoring material to systematically investigate the binding strength between SA@MXene and Al2Sn, the sulfur reduction process on MXene, and their geometric configurations, stabilities, and electronic structures. We evaluated the reaction activity of the various SA@MXene nanosheets and discovered four high-performance cathode candidates for Al-S batteries (SA = Y, Nb, Mo, Tc) with a minimum reaction energy barrier of 0.23 eV. Importantly, to unravel the interaction mechanism between Al2Snand the anchoring material, we proposed an activity volcano by consolidating the decisive S8*, Al2S8*, and Al2S12∗ binding strengths, which provides a significant roadmap for designing cathodes for Al-S batteries. The proposed study of the Al-S conversion process will benefit the understanding of sulfur chemistry and provide valuable inspiration for the design of other catalytic reaction processes.",ACS Materials Letters
Boosting the Rate Performance of Li–S Batteries via Highly Dispersed Cobalt Nanoparticles Embedded into Nitrogen-Doped Hierarchical Porous Carbon,"© 2022 CCS Chemistry. All rights reserved.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are one of the most promising alternatives to lithium–ion batteries because of the advantageous high energy density and low cost. However, the practical applications of Li–S batteries are hampered by a severe shuttle effect and sluggish polysulfide redox conversion. Herein, highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles (∼0.8 wt %) embedded into nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon (Co@N-HPC) are designed as an effective electrocatalyst for Li–S batteries, which exhibit a synergistic effect of anchoring and dual-directional catalytic conversion of polysulfides. The experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Co@N-HPC not only provides strong chemical affinity to polysulfides but also lowers the Li+ diffusion barrier and facilitates the precipitation and decomposition of Li2S, thus effectively inhibiting the shuttle effect and promoting the reaction kinetics of polysulfides. In addition, the well-dispersed Co nanoparticles in the three-dimensional carbon matrix guarantee the exposure of abundant polysulfide confining sites and catalytically active sites. Accordingly, the Li–S batteries assembled with Co@N-HPC functional separators harvest a high rate performance (808.4 mAh g−1 at 10 C), a long-lasting cycle stability (0.055% decay per cycle over 1000 cycles at 4 C), and a superior areal capacity retention (5.78 mAh cm−2 after 100 cycles with a high sulfur loading of 7 mg cm−2).",CCS Chemistry

However, they still suffer from huge volume expansion/contraction during cycling, leading to fast decay of the reversible capacity and poor cycle stability. In this work, a graded porous carbon matrix has been in situ constructed successfully to strengthen structural stability of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles via a facile and green low-temperature combustion method. The calcination temperature has a significant effect on the purity and electrochemical performances of the final NiFe2O4/C composites. NiFe2O4/C prepared at 350 °C shows a high first discharge capacity of 1385.8 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1, excellent cycle stability, and good rate capability. This excellent electrochemical performance may be attributed to its favorable graded porous structure. The carbon matrix can effectively protect the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles, buffer the surface stress caused by volume expansion/contraction, and facilitate the transmission of electrons and Li+ ions. The symbiotic relationship between NiFe2O4 active nanoparticles and graded porous carbon matrix strengthens the structural stability of the electrode, which expands the way of designing high-performance electrode materials for secondary rechargeable batteries.",Journal of Materials Science

Advanced Energy Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Sodium metal batteries are recognized as promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices, as a result of their high energy density, low redox potential, and cheap material price. Na metal anodes, however, generally exhibit notorious problems, including progressively thickened interfaces with active Na loss and Na metal dendrite growth with safety hazards. Herein, a lightweight aerogel consisting of MgF2 nanocrystals grown on a reduced graphene oxide (RGO) aerogel matrix (MgF2@RGO) is rationally designed as a multifunctional host material for Na metal anodes. The MgF2 nanocrystals can be electrochemically converted in situ into Mg and NaF nanograins during the first Na plating process, in which the Mg works as sodiophilic nucleation seeds for Na plating and NaF plays a key role in suppressing Na dendrite growth. Significantly, the Na metal anodes with the MgF2@RGO aerogel host deliver significantly enhanced Coulombic efficiency and dramatically improved cycling stability for more than 1600 h. The morphology evolution confirms the advantages of the Na metal anode with the MgF2@RGO host, which exhibits dense and flat interfaces. By pairing with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, the Na metal batteries achieve stable cycling and good rate capability, suggesting the potential of the Na/MgF2@RGO anode for practical applications.",Advanced Energy Materials

Among electrochemical energy storage devices, the lithium-ion battery (LIB) has dominated due to its high energy and power density. The success of LIBs has generated increased interest in sodium-ion battery (NaB) technology amid concerns of the sustainability and cost of lithium resources. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that sodium-ion solid-state electrolytes (NaSEs) have considerable potential to enable new cell chemistries that can deliver superior electrochemical performance to liquid-electrolyte-based NaBs.

Herein, theoretical calculations of interfacial interactions of catalysts and polysulfides in terms of the surface adsorption state, interfacial ions migration, and electronic concentration around the Fermi level are systematically proposed as guiding principles of catalyst selection for RT Na–S batteries. As a case, MoN catalyst is accurately selected from transition metal nitrides with different d orbital electrons, and for experiment, it is introduced into the carbon nanofibers as a dual-functioning host (MoN@CNFs). The MoN@CNFs can effectively anchor polysulfides and accelerate their conversion reaction. In addition, for the sodium anode, the MoN@CNFs can also induce uniform deposition of Na and inhibit dendrite growth, which are supported by in situ characterizations and finite element simulation technique. As a result, the as-prepared RT Na–S battery displays high reversible capacity of 990 mAh g–1 at 0.2 A g–1 after 100 cycles and long lifespan over 1500 cycles at 2 A g–1. Even with high S loading of 5 mg cm–2, the RT Na–S battery still exhibits a high areal capacity of 2.5 mAh cm–2.",Advanced Materials

Ultrathin Metallic NbS2 Nanosheets with Unusual Intercalation Mechanism for Ultra-Stable Potassium-Ion Storage,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show great potential as anodes for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity and relatively low working potential. However, usually the conversion mechanism seriously hinders the long-term cycle stability for PIBs due to the huge structural change. Herein, the synthesis of a class of ultrathin metallic 2H-phase NbS2 nanosheets with large expanded interlayer spacing of 0.65 nm and high conductivity for boosting the potassium ion storage is reported. It is demonstrated that the as-prepared NbS2 nanosheets show an unexpected intercalation mechanism for potassium ion storage, which is conceptually different from the well-known intercalation-conversion mechanism of typical TMDs. As a consequence, the ultrathin NbS2 nanosheets deliver superior rate capability (205.5 mAh g−1 at ultrahigh current density of 10 A g−1) and outstanding long-term cycling performance (169.5 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 4000 cycles with a very low decay rate of 0.005% per cycle), representing the most stable TMD-based anode materials for PIBs. Ex situ measurements and first-principles calculations disclose and interpret that NbS2 nanosheets store potassium ions through only the intercalation mechanism without any conversion reaction taking place in the potassiation/depotassiation process, which highly improves the structural stability of electrode materials, hence promoting the long-term cycle performance.",Advanced Functional Materials
Delocalizing the d-electrons spin states of Mn site in MnO2 for anion-intercalation energy storage,"© 2022MnO2 offers potentially the supercapacitors with high energy density due to its high theoretical capacity. However, the Na+ storage performance of MnO2 is challenged by the sluggish electron/ion transfer kinetics. Herein, we report the engineering of delocalized d-electrons spin states of Mn site through simple Ni doping in MnO2 (Ni-MnO2) to greatly boost its Na+ storage performance. Experimental results confirm that the obtained Ni-MnO2 exhibits a well-defined d-electrons configuration with delocalized spin states. Consequently, the Ni-MnO2 shows a high capacity of 327 F g−1 and an excellent rate capability of 240 F g−1 at 20 A g−1, apparently outperforming the counterpart of MnO2. Moreover, theoretical simulations suggest that the delocalization of d-electrons spin states of Mn site significantly lowers the Na+ transfer energy barrier and improves the electronic conductivity. The accelerated electron/ion transfer kinetics of Ni-MnO2 are further verified by assembling a Ni-MnO2-based asymmetric supercapacitor, which delivers a remarkable energy density of 70.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 3600 W kg−1. Our findings not only provide a rational strategy to boost the Na+ storage performance of MnO2 cathode, but also give a deep insight into the relationship of delocalized d-electrons spin states with the energy storage performance.",Nano Energy
High-density/efficient surface active sites on modified separators to boost Li-S batteries via atomic Co3+-Se termination,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Various and critical electrocatalytic processes are involved during the redox reactions in the Li-S batteries, which extremely depend on the surface structure and chemical state. Recently, single-atom concept unlocks a route to maximize the use of surface-active atoms, however, further increasing the density of active site is still strictly limited by the inherent structure that single-atoms are only highly-dispersed on substrate. Herein, we provide a viewpoint that an elaborate facet design with single-crystalline structure engineering can harvest high-density surface active sites, which can significantly boost the electrocatalyst performance for excellent Li-S batteries. Specifically, the single-crystal CoSe2 (scCS) exhibits three-types of terminated (011) facet, efficiently obtaining the surface with a high-rich Co3+—Se bond termination, in contrast with lots of surface grain boundaries and dangling bonds in polycrystalline CoSe2. Surprisingly, the surface active sites concentration can reach more than 69%. As anticipated, it can provide high-density and high-efficient active sites, enormously suppressing the shuttle effect and improving the reaction kinetics via accelerating the conversion and deposition of polysulfides and Li2S. This surface lattice strategy with element terminated mode is a promising approach for designing electrocatalyst effect-based energy system, not merely for Li-S batteries.

Stable Cycling of Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries Based on an In Situ Crosslinked Gel Polymer Electrolyte,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.High-temperature sodium-sulfur battery (HT Na–S) technology has attracted substantial interest in the stationary energy storage sector due to its low cost and high energy density. However, the currently used solid electrolyte (ß-alumina) is expensive and can only be operated at high temperatures, which compromises safety. On the other hand, liquid electrolytes in room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries (RT Na–S) are susceptible to dendrite formation and polysulfide shuttle. Consequently, an electrolyte with both solid (shuttle blocking) and liquid (ionic conductivity) properties to overcome the above-mentioned issues is highly desired. Herein, a high-performance quasi-solid state crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) prepared in situ using pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA) exhibiting high ionic conductivity of 2.33 mS cm−1 at 25 °C is presented. The GPE-based electrolyte shows high stability resulting in a high discharge capacity of >600 mAh gs−1 after 2500 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.91%. Density functional theory calculations reveal a weak interaction between the Na+ ions and the oxygen molecules of the PETA moiety, which leads to a facile cation movement. The crosslinked polymer network is tightly connected to the cathode and can confine sulfides, thereby facilitating the conversion process.",Advanced Functional Materials

Unfortunately, the practical development of sodium metal batteries is inherently plagued by challenges such as the side reactions and the growth of Na dendrites. Herein we report a highly stable Bi-based “sodiophilic” substrate to stabilize Na anode, which is created by in-situ electrochemical reactions of 3D hierarchical porous Bi2MoO6 (BMO) microspheres. BMO is initially transformed into the Bi “nanoseeds” embedded in the Na-Mo-O matrix. Subsequently, the Bi nanoseeds working as preferential nucleation sites through the formation of Bi-Na alloy enable the non-dendritic Na deposition. The asymmetric cells based on such BMO-based substrate can deliver a long-term cycling for 600 cycles at a large capacity of 4 mAh cm−2and for 800 cycles at a high current density of 10 mA cm−2. Even at a high depth of discharge (66.67%), the Na-predeposited BMO (Na@BMO) electrodes can cycle for more than 1600 h.

Here, a novel composite SE is proposed, with a high ionic conductivity, composed of Na3SbS4 (NSS) and oxysulfide glass. The study reveals that the P2S7-aOa and PS4-aOa units in oxysulfide play various roles: The former is deoxidized to release free O ions, which reacts with the anode via migrating to form oxides, favoring an improved interface stability. The latter is highly stable upon cycling, thereby maintaining an ion transport network. Meanwhile, NSS acts as a dendrite predator via reacting with penetrated Na. These advantages enable the resulting ASS Na battery with superior long-term cycling performance at a high current density at room temperature, one of the best results so far. This discovery sheds light on innovative advanced SE materials through an oxysulfide-based composite design.",Advanced Functional Materials

Like organic electrolyte, polysulfide dissolution is a primary obstacle in aqueous electrolyte due to the strong polarity and high activity of water. In this study, various electrochemical, spectroscopic and visualization studies provide an evidence that polysulfide dissolution is sensitive towardoperating time, C-rates, and depth of discharges, which can be tuned by increasing salt concentration and sluggish kinetics was enhanced by using MNC-600 host. Post analysis demonstrates that high cycling stability in WiSE is due to the formation of stable SEI, consisting of Na2CO3.

Improving thermal stability of sulfide solid electrolytes: An intrinsic theoretical paradigm,"© 2022 The Authors. InfoMat published by UESTC and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) have been widely acknowledged as the key next-generation energy storage technology/device, due to their high safety and energy density. Among all solid electrolytes (SEs) that have been studied for ASSBs, sulfide SEs represent the most promising technical route due to their ultra-high ionic conductivity and desirable mechanical property. However, few results have been reported to study the thermal stability/safety issue of sulfide SEs and ASSBs. Herein, we develop the first-of-its-kind theoretical paradigm and a new conceptual parameter Th to quantitatively calculate/predict the essential thermal stability of sulfide SEs. This theoretical paradigm takes all types of parameters (e.g. crystal structure, localized polyhedra configuration, bond energy, bond type, bond number, normalization factor, and the energy correction factor) into consideration, and more importantly, can be simplified into one straightforward equation for its convenient application in any crystalline systems. To prove its functionality, the typical experimental strategies (stoichiometric ratio control and elemental doping) are adopted for typical sulfide SEs (Li7P3S11, Li3PS4) to improve their thermal stabilities, based on the predictions obtained from the derived theory and equation. Moreover, the potential doping elements to improve thermal stability of sulfide SEs are screened throughout the whole periodic table, and the theoretically predicted trends correspond well with experimental evidence. This work may represent the most critical breakthroughs in the research field of thermal stability for sulfide SEs, not only because it fills the gap of this field, but also due to its precise and quantitative prediction based on a complete consideration of all parameters that determine their thermal stabilities. The handy model developed herein can also be applied to any crystalline materials. (Figure presented.).",InfoMat
Sphere-in-fiber hybrid of N-doped carbon/cerium dioxide as an interlayer material with superior electrocatalytic performance for lithium sulfide precipitation and conversion,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The inferior conductivity and infamous “shuttle effect” of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries lead to low sulfur utilization and undesired cycle stability, which both seriously affect their practical application. Here, a multifunctional nanofiber material based on cerium dioxide spheres embedded inside nitrogen-doped carbon fibers (denoted as NCF@CeO2) fabricated by electrospinning technology is used as an interlayer for high-performance Li-S batteries. The nitrogen-doped carbon fiber skeleton matrix provides a through-conducting grid to accelerate electron transfer at the interface of the nitrogen-doped carbon and the CeO2, and the large specific surface area guarantees a sufficient interfacial fast-redox reaction for sulfur species. CeO2 with a hollow structure provides strong physicochemical adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) to weaken the migration behavior, and abundant oxygen defects as catalytic active sites are conducive to lithium sulfide conversion. The “sphere in fiber” construction minimizes the direct contact between the catalyst and electrolyte, effectively avoiding side reactions. Based on the multiple functions of nitrogen-doped carbon fibers and CeO2, Li-S batteries with NCF@CeO2 interlayers exhibit superior electrochemical performances, including a high discharge specific capacity of 1072.9 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and a low capacity decay rate of only 0.063% per cycle after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the mechanisms of LiPSs adsorption-conversion and the quantification of the catalytic ability are elaborately clarified.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Immobilization of mercury in tailings originating from the historical artisanal and small-scale gold mining using sodium polysulfide,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.A series of sodium polysulfides (SPSs) with different sulfur indexes was prepared as stabilizers to amend elemental mercury-contaminated artisanal small-scale gold mine (ASGM) tailings in Hubei, China, by controlling the molar ratio of sulfur and sodium sulfides as 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 during the synthesis. XRD, XPS, and laser Raman spectroscopy all suggested that the synthesized SPSs were a mixture of multiple polysulfides, sulfur, sodium sulfides, and sodium thiosulfate. Based on toxicity characteristic leaching procedure test (TCLP), mercury stabilization efficiency of SPSs was evaluated and proved to be more superior than sulfur, sodium sulfide, and also calcium polysulfide, with an optimal stabilization efficiency of 97.16% at SPS/THg = 1:2, SPSs pH = initial pH, and liquid-to-solid ratio = 20:7. A pseudo-second-order kinetic model was able to interpret the stabilization kinetics and demonstrated that mercury stabilization rate increased with the sulfur index in the SPSs, but excess SPSs were potentially to inhibit the precipitation of mercury. Speciation analysis results determined with sequential extraction indicated that the unstable mercury, elemental mercury, and organic-bound mercury fractions decreased respectively by up to 88.6%, 53.5%, and 26.3%. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the mercury stabilization in the mine tailings amended with SPSs mainly occurs from the precipitation of the elemental mercury, and the organic mercury fraction reduction was correlated with the decrease of the unstable mercury.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research
Synthesis of Non-precious N-doped Mesoporous Fe3O4/CoO@NC Materials towards Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction for Microbial Fuel Cells,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.N-doped transition metal oxides are strategic materials towards the efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of microbial fuel cells (MFCs).

Fe3O4/CoO@NC-750 exhibits the best performance with an efficient four-electron transfer pathway. The optimal power density of MFCs by using Fe3O4/CoO@NC-750 as the cathode catalyst (1243.4 mW ⋅ m−2) is superior to that of the MFCs with commercial Pt/C catalyst (1080 mW ⋅ m−2), which shows an outstanding activity towards ORR. No significant decrease in output voltage results over 70 days, which shows an excellent electrochemical stability.",Electroanalysis
A bidirectional electrocatalyst for enhancing Li2S nucleation and decomposition kinetics in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Accelerating sulfur redox reactions and suppressing the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) are crucial for high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we develop a highly efficient bidirectional electrocatalyst (Ti3C2/(NiCo)0.85Se) consisting of 2D Ti3C2 nanosheets loaded with well-dispersed (NiCo)0.85Se nanoparticles. Based on electrochemical analysis and theoretical calculations, the Ti3C2/(NiCo)0.85Se heterostructure is demonstrated to provide abundant active sites for steady bidirectional electrocatalysis and abundant lithiophilic-sulfiphilic anchoring points for the immobilization of LiPSs. Ti3C2 promotes the reduction process of LiPSs to Li2S, and (NiCo)0.85Se enhances the decomposition of Li2S. Moreover, the (NiCo)0.85Se nanoparticles prevent the Ti3C2 nanosheets from aggregating, ensuring a hierarchical porous framework endowed with good structural robustness and fast electron/ion transportation. Li-S batteries with Ti3C2/(NiCo)0.85Se modified separators exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan with a capacity decay rate of only 0.03% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 1C and improved rate capability. When equipped with a high sulfur loading of 6.4 mg cm−2 and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 8 μL mg−1, the cell maintains a distinguished area capacity of 9.7 mA h cm−2. This work provides a general strategy for the design of bidirectional electrocatalysts for high-performance Li-S batteries with especially remarkable cycling stability.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Phase Engineering of Defective Copper Selenide toward Robust Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and the sluggish Li-S conversion kinetics are two main barriers toward the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, we propose the addition of copper selenide nanoparticles at the cathode to trap LiPS and accelerate the Li-S reaction kinetics. Using both computational and experimental results, we demonstrate the crystal phase and concentration of copper vacancies to control the electronic structure of the copper selenide, its affinity toward LiPS chemisorption, and its electrical conductivity. The adjustment of the defect density also allows for tuning the electrochemically active sites for the catalytic conversion of polysulfide. The optimized S/Cu1.8Se cathode efficiently promotes and stabilizes the sulfur electrochemistry, thus improving significantly the LSB performance, including an outstanding cyclability over 1000 cycles at 3 C with a capacity fading rate of just 0.029% per cycle, a superb rate capability up to 5 C, and a high areal capacity of 6.07 mAh cm-2 under high sulfur loading. Overall, the present work proposes a crystal phase and defect engineering strategy toward fast and durable sulfur electrochemistry, demonstrating great potential in developing practical LSBs.",ACS Nano
"Ionic Conductivity, Na Plating-Stripping, and Battery Performance of Solid Polymer Na Ion Electrolyte Based on Poly(vinylidene fluoride) and Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)","© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Solid-state sodium-ion batteries (ss-SIBs) are a promising alternative to commercially available lithium-ion batteries for next-generation energy storage applications due to the abundance and cost-effectiveness of sodium over lithium. Herein, using a facile solution casting process, a high sodium-ion conductive, filler-less composite solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) film based on poly(vinylidene fluoride) polymer, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) binder, and NaPF6salt for ss-SIB has been successfully fabricated. Total conductivities of 8.51 × 10-4and 8.36 × 10-3S cm-1at 23 and 83 °C, respectively, were observed from the SPE. A hybrid symmetric half-cell assembly using Na electrode and 1 M NaClO4in ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) (EC/PC = 1:1 wt %) electrolyte showed excellent Na plating-stripping performance at 10 mA cm-2at 23 °C. The study showed that PVP binder played an important role in achieving good Na ion conductivity and excellent Na plating-stripping performance, highlighting the applicability of the as-prepared SPE in next-generation high-power rechargeable SIBs. A full cell with an SPE, a Na anode, and a Na3V2(PO4)3cathode showed a discharge capacity of 93.2 mAh g-1at 0.1 C with 86% capacity retention and 99.68% Coulombic efficiency for 100 cycles.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Electrolyte Sieving Chemistry in Suppressing Gas Evolution of Sodium-Metal Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The sodium (Na)-metal batteries hold great promise as a sustainable technology owing to the high element abundance and low cost. However, the generally used carbonate electrolytes remain highly reactive towards Na metal, leading to flammable gas evolution. Here, we propose an electrolyte sieving strategy to separate anion-mediated ion-pairs from dilute electrolytes by introducing a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film. The anion-mediated ion-pair firstly weakens the electron-withdrawing property of the cation, which effectively suppresses the gassing. In addition, the sieved electrolyte promotes the formation of robust inorganic-dominated solid electrolyte interphases. Therefore, it contributes to stable Na plating/stripping in Na|Al half cells with Coulombic efficiency maintaining at 98.5 % and a long service life of 800 cycles in full cells. Moreover, the electrode stability is well preserved even under harsh conditions of high temperature and ester-based electrolytes with higher reactivity.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Rational Electrolyte Design toward Cyclability Remedy for Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Rechargeable room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries are a promising energy storage technology, owing to the merits of high energy density and low cost. However, their electrochemical performance has been severely hindered by the poor compatibility between the existing electrolytes and the electrodes. Here, we demonstrate that an all-fluorinated electrolyte, containing 2,2,2-trifluoro-N,N-dimethylacetamide (FDMA) solvent, 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether (MTFE) anti-solvent and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive, can greatly enhance the reversibility and cyclability of RT Na–S batteries. A NaF- and Na3N-rich cathode electrolyte interphase derived from FDMA and FEC enables a “quasi-solid-phase” Na–S conversion, eliminating the shuttle of polysulfides. The MTFE not only reduces polysulfide dissolution, but also further stabilizes the Na anode via a tailored solvation structure. The as-developed RT Na–S batteries deliver a high capacity, long lifespan, and enhanced safety.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Nickel-Copper Alloy Nanoparticles Embedded in N-Doped Porous Carbon Nanosheets for Supercapacitors and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Exploring high-performance and cost-affordable electroactive materials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and energy storage is of paramount importance to respond positively to the looming energy crisis. Here we report a nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanosheet decorated with nickel-copper alloy nanoparticles (NiCu@NHPC), which can be fabricated in large quantities using lactose and nitrate as precursors via a simple two-step carbonization strategy. No external template or pore-forming agent was used in the preparation process. The structural characterizations reveal that monodisperse NiCu alloy nanoparticles are tightly embedded into the porous carbon framework. Benefiting from its outstanding structure feature, the NiCu@NHPC hybrid exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance. Specifically, the NiCu@NHPC hybrid as supercapacitor electrode material displays a high specific capacity up to 1175 C g-1 at 1 A g-1 and a good rate performance. Meanwhile, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor device NiCu@NHPC//NHPC delivers a desirable energy density of 61.33 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 960 W kg-1 and a long-term cycle life. More importantly, the NiCu@NHPC hybrid also manifests a superior electrocatalytic activity for HER with an overpotential of 80 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a lower Tafel slope (76 mV dec-1), and good durability in acidic media. This work provides a facile but effective strategy for designing bimetallic alloy@carbon hybrids for application as high-performance supercapacitor electrode material and HER electrocatalyst.",ACS Applied Nano Materials
"Hierarchical MXene/transition metal oxide heterostructures for rechargeable batteries, capacitors, and capacitive deionization","© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.2D MXenes have attracted considerable attention due to their high electronic conductivity, tunable metal compositions, functional termination groups, low ion diffusion barriers, and abundant active sites. However, MXenes suffer from sheet stacking and partial surface oxidation, limiting their energy storage and water treatment development. To solve these problems and enhance the performance of MXenes in practical applications, various hierarchical MXene/transition metal oxide (MXene/TMO) heterostructures are rationally designed and constructed. The hierarchical MXene/TMO heterostructures can not only prevent the stacking of MXene sheets and improve the electronic conductivity and buffer the volume change of TMOs during the electrochemical reaction process. The synergistic effect of conductive MXenes and active TMOs also makes MXene/TMO heterostructures promising electrode materials for energy storage and seawater desalination. This review mainly introduces and discusses the recent research progress in MXene/TMO heterostructures, focusing on their synthetic strategies, heterointerface engineering, and applications in rechargeable batteries, capacitors, and capacitive deionization (CDI). Finally, the key challenges and prospects for the future development of the MXene/TMO heterostructures in rechargeable batteries, capacitors, and CDI are proposed.",Nanoscale
Controlled growth of 3D assemblies of edge enriched multilayer MoS2 nanosheets for dually selective NH3 and NO2 gas sensors,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Herein, we report on the successful controlled growth of edge enriched 3D assemblies of MoS2 nanosheets by adjusting the gas flow rate during atmospheric pressure CVD. The results revealed that 30 ml min−1 was the optimal flow rate, in which the growth direction shifts from in-plane nanosheets to out-of-plane 3D assemblies of MoS2 nanosheets. It is suggested that, at this flow rate, we have an ideal tradeoff between the surface interaction and the mass transport of precursor molecules. Morphological, structural and chemical composition analyses showed the formation of vertically oriented MoS2 nanosheets with MoO3−x impurities, resulting from the incomplete sulfurization during the synthesis. Based on the morphological evolution of the studied material, the growth mechanism was explored. The gas sensing properties of the as grown films were tested against NH3 and NO2. They exhibited stable and reproducible responses with excellent sensitivity to ppm-level NH3 (20% response to 2 ppm) and ppb-level NO2 (11% response to 20 ppb). Additionally, this nanomaterial showed dual selectivity towards NH3 at room temperature and NO2 at 100 °C. To the best of our knowledge, none of the reported studies on MoS2 based gas sensors have described this dual selectivity. The experimental detection limit was below 2 ppm for NH3 while it was below 20 ppb for NO2. Besides, the vertical growth of edge enriched MoS2 bestows the sensors with notable resilience against high levels of ambient humidity. The sensor response was only slightly increased (R = 70%) in a humid environment compared to a dry background (R = 65%) when measuring 800 ppb of NO2. Therefore, this paper shows for the first time that by adjusting the flow rate it is possible to tune the morphology of AP-CVD grown MoS2 for achieving a 3D sponge-like assembly of nanoflakes, showing high sensitivity to NO2 and NH3 and low humidity cross-sensitivity. In addition, the nanomaterial can be made quite specific for detecting NO2 or NH3 by selecting its operating temperature.",Journal of Materials Chemistry C
Research Progress and Perspective on Lithium/Sodium Metal Anodes for Next-Generation Rechargeable Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.With the development of consumer electronic devices and electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are vital components for high energy storage with great impact on our modern life. However, LIBs still cannot meet all the essential demands of rapidly growing new industries. In pursuance of higher energy requirement, metal batteries (MBs) are the next-generation high-energy-density devices. Li/Na metals are considered as an ideal anode for high-energy batteries due to extremely high theoretical specific capacity (3860 and 1165 mAh g−1 for Li and Na, respectively) and low electrochemical potential (−3.04 V for Li and −2.71 V for Na vs. standard hydrogen electrode). Unfortunately, uncontrolled dendrite growth, high reactivity, and infinite volume change induce severe safety concerns and poor cycle efficiency during their application. Consequently, MBs are far from commercialization stage. This Review represents a comprehensive overview of failure mechanism of lithium/sodium metal anode and its progress for rechargeable batteries through (i) electrolyte optimization, (ii) artificial solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formation, and (iii) nanoengineering at materials level in current collector, anode, and host. The challenges in current MBs research and potential applications of lithium/sodium metal anodes are also outlined and summarized.",ChemSusChem
A liquid cathode/anode based solid-state lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSolid-state lithium sulfur batteries constantly suffer from a poor interfacial compatibility between solid-state cathode/anode and electrolyte, and low critical current density of Li metal anode (< 3 mA cm−2). Here, a concept of a liquid cathode/anode based, room-temperature, solid-state lithium sulfur battery with low impedance electrode/electrolyte interfaces is presented. Due to an extremely stable liquid-solid interface with a high compatibility and unique properties of liquid alloy, the liquid Li-amalgam anode based symmetric cells show a superior electrochemical performance, and no internal short circuit occurs as they run at 55.6 mA cm−2 for 10,000 cycles. Liquid Li2S8 polysulfide catholyte can afford a high active material loading (≥135.2 mg mL−1) and has a good contact with the solid-sate electrolyte. The cathode/anode and electrolyte are tightly welded together by the liquid-solid interfaces, and the resulting cells show high performance and good structural stability during cycling.",Electrochimica Acta
Construction of Ni/Ni3N heterojunctions as reversible micro-reaction centers for lithium polysulfides,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are one of the most promising next-generation energy storage systems. However, some intractable issues such as “shuttle effect”, low electronic conductivity and large volume change of the S cathode seriously limit their application. In this work, a composite of Ni/Ni3N heterojunction-decorated hollow carbon nanotubes (Ni/Ni3N-CNT) was fabricated and used as a sulfur host, meanwhile, the mechanism of Ni/Ni3N heterojunctions in inhibiting the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) was investigated in detail. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental conclusions reveal that the Ni/Ni3N heterojunctions promote the nucleation and growth of Li2S2/Li2S and accelerate the redox process of LiPSs. Consequently, the Ni/Ni3N-CNT/S electrode demonstrates satisfactory electrochemical performance. It delivers a superior reversible capacity of 643.3 mA h g−1 at 5C rate with an average decay rate of 0.10% per cycle over 400 cycles. Besides it can present a specific capacity of 439.7 mA h g−1 with a high S loading of 5.0 mg cm−2 after 100 cycles. Most importantly, this work proposes a simple method for the preparation of Ni/Ni3N heterostructures which can be used as reversible catalytic micro-reaction centers for LiPSs. In particular, our results will provide an experimental and theoretical basis for the application of other metal/metal nitride heterostructures in LSBs.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Tröger's base polymer blended with poly(ether ketone cardo) for high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell applications,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing membrane electrolyte materials with high performance and low cost is a key factor in promoting the application and commercialization of the high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC). In this work, a Tröger's base (TB) polymer is synthesized from commercially available and low-cost 4,4′-diamine-3,3′-dimethyl-biphenyl (DMBP) and dimethoxy methane in trifluoroacetic acid via a one-pot TB polymerization reaction under mild conditions. The obtained polymer is composited by TB unit and DMBP moiety (named as DMBP-TB), which occupies a good organic solubility, high thermal stability and excellent chemical resistance. Due to the built-in bicyclic amine rings and intrinsic microporous structure, the pure DMBP-TB membrane exhibits a remarkable phosphoric acid (PA) doping content as high as 1077% in 85 wt% PA solution at room temperature. However, the excessive swelling and poor mechanical integrity hinder the PA doped DMBP-TB membrane as the HT-PEM. Thus, the commercial and low-cost engineering thermoplastic of poly(ether ketone cardo) (PEKC) is employed as the enhanced material to prepare DMBP-TB blend membranes. The DMBP-TB/50%PEKC/149%PA membrane displays an anhydrous conductivity of 0.061 S cm−1 at 180 °C and a tensile strength of 8.7 MPa at room temperature, which enables H2–O2 fuel cell with a peak power density of 536 mW cm−2 at 180 °C without backpressure, suggesting the utility for HT-PEMFCs.",Journal of Membrane Science
Ti3C2Tx aerogel with 1D unidirectional channels for high mass loading supercapacitor electrodes,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.As one of the typical MXenes materials, 2D Ti3C2Tx has attracted extensive attention in the field of energy storage. However, due to the restacking problem of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, the electrochemical performance of Ti3C2Tx is unsatisfactory. In this paper, a scheme is proposed to obtain 3D aerogel with 1D channels by directional freeze drying of Ti3C2Tx. With the help of the unidirectional channels, the 3D Ti3C2Tx/Sodium alginate (SA) aerogel can effectively solve the stacking problem of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, and it also accelerates the diffusion of ions. The Ti3C2Tx/SA-5 electrode can still reach the mass capacitance of 284.5 F g−1 and the areal capacitance of 4030.4 mF cm−2 at 2 mV s−1 when the loading is 14.2 mg cm−2 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, the electrode showed good cycling performance without capacitor degradation after 20,000 cycles at 50 mV s−1. These results suggest that by using the strategy of building special 3D structure of 2D MXene with 1D unidirectional channels, high performance supercapacitor electrodes with high mass loading can be realized.",Ceramics International

Composite of Ge and α-MnSe in carbon nanofibers as a high- performance anode material for LIBs,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Improving the performance of anode materials is of great importance for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Transition metal selenides compositing carbon and germanium (Ge) have attracted extensive attention. In this work, an anode material that integrates Ge and α-MnSe in carbon nanofibers (CNFs) was first synthesized by heat treatment after electrospinning. The coupling of Ge with α-MnSe and carbon can cause the growth process of α-MnSe to occur inside the CNFs, which can buffer the volume change, refine the grains and avoid particles protruding from the surface of CNFs. In addition, the interconnected conductive network of Ge/α-MnSe@CNFs can provide fast diffusion channels for Li ions and improve the electrical conductivity. Importantly, there is a synergistic effect of Ge, α-MnSe, and CNFs on the anode material for LIBs. As expected, Ge/α-MnSe@CNFs exhibited an excellent performance with a capacity of 1514.7 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 and 1030 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles even at 1 A g−1. Therefore, this new preparation strategy of Ge/α-MnSe@CNFs offers novel ideas to develop high-performance and long-life LIBs.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Room-temperature liquid metal engineered iron current collector enables stable and dendrite-free sodium metal batteries in carbonate electrolytes,"© 2022Metallic sodium (Na) is believed to be a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low electrochemical potential, high theoretical specific capacity, superior electrical conductivity, and so on. However, issues such as high chemical activity, the growth of Na dendrites, large volume change, and unstable interface impede its practical application. We design a cheap iron (Fe)-based substrate decorated by a thin liquid metal Ga layer for stable and dendrite-free Na metal anodes in low-cost carbonate electrolytes. The inherent mechanism of Ga-based liquid metal in inhibiting the growth of Na dendrites was revealed for the first time. Liquid metal Ga with sodiophilic property can act as nucleation seeds to decrease the nucleation barrier and induce homogeneous Na+ flux, resulting in uniform and dendrite-free Na deposition. Full cells with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode were also assembled to verify the practical application ability of the modified Na metal anode. Under the regulation of the liquid metal layer, the Coulombic efficiency, cycling life, and capacity of batteries are obviously enhanced. The strategy proposed here cannot only reduce the cost of batteries but also improve their electrochemical and safety performance.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology

The current status of sodium metal anodes for improved sodium batteries and its future perspectives,"© 2022 Author(s).Sodium-ion batteries with evident merits in resource abundance and expenditure are emerging as a more suitable alternative to lithium-ion batteries for fulfilling the voracious energy demand of human activities. As the integral component of the battery, the exploration of anode materials suited to the electrochemical system during the last few decades has been never suspended, and the sodium metal anode successfully stands out with its high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, a huge gap exists between the direct usage of the sodium metal anode and the large-scale applications, as the uncontrollable sodium dendritic growth during cycling brings about serious concerns (i.e. infinite volume change, unstable solid electrolyte interphase, and safety issues) on battery performance losses. Although a few review articles on high-performance sodium metal anode have been already published, new research on solving the aforementioned challenges is still in progress. Therefore, we herein summarize the recent progress on the high-energy sodium metal anode from four aspects (protective layers, electrolyte additives, three-dimensional framework current collectors, and alloy materials) together with the detailed discussion and analysis in this Perspective. Furthermore, the potential directions and prospects of future research on constructing high-performance sodium metal anodes are also proposed.",APL Materials
Stabilizing Metallic Na Anodes via Sodiophilicity Regulation: A Review,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This review focuses on the Na wetting challenges and relevant strategies regarding stabilizing sodium-metal anodes in sodium-metal batteries (SMBs). The Na anode is the essential component of three key energy storage systems, including molten SMBs (i.e., intermediate-temperature Na-S and ZEBRA batteries), all-solid-state SMBs, and conventional SMBs using liquid electrolytes. We begin with a general description of issues encountered by different SMB systems and point out the common challenge in Na wetting. We detail the emerging strategies of improving Na wettability and stabilizing Na metal anodes for the three types of batteries, with the emphasis on discussing various types of tactics developed for SMBs using liquid electrolytes. We conclude with a discussion of the overlooked yet critical aspects (Na metal utilization, N/P ratio, critical current density, etc.) in the existing strategies for an individual battery system and propose promising areas (anolyte incorporation and catholyte modifications for lower-temperature molten SMBs, cell evaluation under practically relevant current density and areal capacity, etc.) that we believe to be the most urgent for further pursuit. Comprehensive investigations combining complementary post-mortem, in situ, and operando analyses to elucidate cell-level structure-performance relations are advocated.",Materials

Despite the hype, SSBs are yet to surpass their liquid counterparts in terms of electrochemical performance. This is mainly due to challenges at both the materials and cell integration levels. Various strategies have been devised to address the issue of SSBs. In this review, we have explored the role of graphene-based materials (GBM) in enhancing the electrochemical performance of SSBs. We have covered each individual component of an SSB (electrolyte, cathode, anode, and interface) and highlighted the approaches using GBMs to achieve stable and better performance. The recent literature shows that GBMs impart stability to SSBs by improving Li+ ion kinetics in the electrodes, electrolyte and at the interfaces. Furthermore, they improve the mechanical and thermal properties of the polymer and ceramic solid-state electrolytes (SSEs). Overall, the enhancements endowed by GBMs will address the challenges that are stunting the proliferation of SSBs.",Nanomaterials

To achieve the large-scale application of SIBs, it is crucial to develop cost-effective anode materials with high Na-ion storage capacity. Herein two-dimensional (2D) conjugated covalent organic frameworks (cCOFs) with N-rich phthalocyanine (Pc) units fused via benzene moieties (named MPc-2D-cCOFs) were explored as the SIBs anode materials.

Ex situ X-ray photoelectron and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies together with theoretical calculations disclose the N atoms at the pore channels and conjugated pyrrole moieties of MPc-2D-cCOFs provide abundant Na-ion storage sites. This, in cooperation with the enhanced electrical conductivity owing to the 2D conjugated structure, contributes to the outstanding Na-ion storage capacity of MPc-2D-cCOFs.

MoC/Mo2C is in situ grown on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes in parallel with formation of extensive nanoporosity. Sulfur impregnation (50 wt% S) results in unique triphasic architecture termed molybdenum carbide–porous carbon nanotubes host (MoC/Mo2C@PCNT–S). Quasi-solid-state phase transformation to Na2S is promoted in carbonate electrolyte, with in situ time-resolved Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical analyses demonstrating minimal soluble polysulfides. MoC/Mo2C@PCNT–S cathodes deliver among the most promising rate performance characteristics in the literature, achieving 987 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, 818 mAh g−1 at 3 A g−1, and 621 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1.

High mass loading cathodes (64 wt% S, 12.7 mg cm−2) also show cycling stability. Density functional theory demonstrates that formation energy of Na2Sx (1 ≤ x ≤ 4) on surface of MoC/Mo2C is significantly lowered compared to analogous redox in liquid. Strong binding of Na2Sx (1 ≤ x ≤ 4) on MoC/Mo2C surfaces results from charge transfer between the sulfur and Mo sites on carbides’ surface.",Advanced Materials

Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.The shell structure design has been recognized as a highly efficient strategy to buffer the severe volume expansion and consecutive pulverization of conversion-type anodes. Nevertheless, construction of a functional shell with a stabilized structure that meets the demands of both high electronic conductivity and feasible pathways for Na+ ions has been a challenge so far. Herein, we design a two-in-one shell configuration for bimetal selenides to achieve fast sodium storage within broadened voltage windows. The hybridized shell, which benefits from the combination of titanium dioxide quantum dots and amorphous carbon, can not only effectively buffer the strain and maintain structural integrity but also allow facile and reversible transport of electrons and Na+ uptake for electrode materials during sodiation/desodiation processes, resulting in increased reaction kinetics and diffusion of sodium ions, conferring many benefits to the functionality of conversion-type electrode materials. As a representative material, Ni-CoSe2 with such structural engineering shows a reversible capacity of 515 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and a stable capacity of 416 mAh g−1 even at 6.4 A g−1; more than 80% of the capacity at 0.1 A g−1 could be preserved, so that this strategy holds great promise for designing fast-charging conversion-type anodes in the future.",Carbon Energy

Herein, we synthesize bio-waste-derived activated carbon (BAC) through a facile synthesis process followed by selenium loading (using melt-infusion method) to form BAC@Se composites. The synthesized BAC and its composite BAC@Se revealed excellent rate performance, great cycling stability, and good reversibility. The BAC revealed a maximum specific capacity of 257 mAh/g at 20 mA/g current density.

AIChE Journal published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Institute of Chemical Engineers.We investigate sulfur infiltration and formation of lower order allotropes in heated porous hosts during fabrication of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery cathodes. Sulfur existence in cathode ultramicropores has been an important question for Li-S batteries, as ultramicropores reduce the polysulfides “shuttle effect” but also delay sulfur dissolution and Li+ ion diffusion in the trapped solid sulfur. A novel continuum-level model is presented including heat transfer and sulfur infiltration, either from the top of a porous host or from the porous host particle surface, and taking into account the pore size distribution. A novel decay factor in modeling sulfur infiltration incorporates the pore wall repulsion energy and allotrope formation energy (predicted by density functional theory [DFT] simulations).

Sustainable cyanide-C60 fullerene cathode to suppress the lithium polysulfides in a lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-Sulfur batteries (LiSB) have attracted substantial interest because of their high theoretical specific energy and environmental friendliness. However, there is a problem that is known as the lithium polysulfides (LiPs) shuttle effect. Several adsorbents have been proposed experimentally and theoretically to suppress the LiPs shuttle. In particular, the use of adsorbents as a conductive material looks promising as it retains the conductivity of the sulfur cathode. Cyanide has shown very good binding towards metals and carbon materials and its functionalization onto carbon materials could be a promising material to not only facilitate the electrical conductivity required to design a cathode material for LiSB but also can suppress the notorious LiPs shuttle effect. Herein, to prepare a sustainable cathode material, we first investigate the functionalization of cyanide with C60 fullerene using the B3LYP-D density functional calculations. It is found that the cyanide (CN) binds upright on a carbon of the C60 fullerene in the most stable configuration. This sustainable cathode model was then used for an interaction study with the lithium polysulfide species at the level of -D3(BJ)/def-SVP method within acetone as the solvent. Results show that the C60 and C60-CN hybrid molecule can form covalent bonds with the S sites of the LiPs molecules. Finally, it is computationally demonstrated that the C60 fullerene can be used as an adsorbent for the removal of cyanide and the final structure can confine the LiPs species making it a promising carbon-based material for the design of a cathode electrode for use in a LiSB.",Sustainable Materials and Technologies

However, the sluggish electrochemical kinetics of sulfur reduction reactions, sulfide oxidation reactions in the sulfur cathode, and the lithium dendrite growth resulted from uncontrollable lithium behaviors in lithium anode have inhibited high-rate conversions and uniform deposition to achieve high performances.

Meanwhile, the anodic plating kinetic behaviors modulated by the catalysts tend to uniformize without dendrite growth. In this review, the various active catalysts in modulating lithium behaviors are summarized, especially for the defect-rich catalysts and single atomic catalysts. The working mechanisms of these highly active catalysts revealed from theoretical simulation to in situ/operando characterizations are also highlighted. Furthermore, the opportunities of future higher performance enhancement to realize practical applications of lithium–sulfur batteries are prospected, shedding light on the future practical development.",Energy and Environmental Materials

A series of characterization tests, such as SEM, XRD and Raman, were used to analyze the morphology, structure and composition, and the electrochemical performances of the material as the anode material of SIBs were tested by assembling the half-cells. The results show that the MoS2 nanosheets with extended layer-spacing of 0.98 nm are uniformly loaded on the layered-network skeleton of PC, together with the PPy coating layer forming the PC/MoS2@PPy composite. This layered sandwiched structure provides a large number of reactive sites for electrochemical sodium storage and effectively alleviates the volume variation of MoS2 in the long cycling process. The three-dimensional conductive network composed of biomass carbon skeleton and PPy also effectively improves the electrical conductivity of the electrodes and accelerates the reaction kinetics of the electrode material.

Published by American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are among the most promising candidates for next-generation high-energy-density batteries; however, the polysulfide shuttle represents a major drawback in their application. Here, we report on sulfurized poly(norbornadiene) (S/pNBD) and its analogue, sulfurized poly(dicyclopentadiene) (S/pDCPD), two polysulfide shuttle-free and cheap cathode materials with good performance in Li-S battery technology. Both S/pNBD and S/pDCPD can be prepared in a straightforward two-step procedure. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and cyclic voltammetry indicate that all sulfur in S/pNBD and S/pDCPD is covalently bound to the polymer matrix in the form of C-Sx-C units. Li-S cells based on an S/pNBD cathode exhibit a high discharge capacity up to 1050 mA h/g sulfur at 1 C with a good capacity retention of 62 % after 1900 cycles. The structurally similar analogue S/pDCPD shows comparable electrochemical performance, again with excellent capacity retention. The high reversibility and ultra-long cycle life of both, S/pNBD and S/pDCPD, are attributed to the covalent binding of sulfur to the polymer backbone.",ACS Applied Energy Materials

However, inevitable lithium polysulfide intermediates' dissolution and migration severely hamper their energy density and calendar life. Therefore, it is of significance to restrain the inevitable polysulfide shuttle effect in electrolytes. Herein, a new type of sulfur-containing polymeric cathode, poly(vinyl trimethoxysilane-co-sulfur) (PVTS), is successfully synthesized by an inverse vulcanization method to solve the polysulfide problem. The well-designed sulfur-containing polymer endows the Li-S battery with better performance, which has several features that are discussed below. First, the covalent bonding of the sulfur atom and the carbon atom of vinyl trimethoxysilane in PVTS effectually limits the polysulfide diffusion and further lessens the polysulfide dissolution, thereby preventing the loss of active materials. Second, a good liquid electrolyte wettability is conducive to the electrochemical reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In the end, a faster charge transfer rate and a favorable lithiation/delithiation kinetics facilitate the electrochemical process.

The high electronic conductivity and the substantial void spaces of the wrinkled N-rGO can improve the electrical conductivity of the active material and accommodate the volume evolution of GeSe2 nanosheets during the (de)lithiation processes, while GeSe2 nanosheets can reduce ion diffusion length effectively. Meanwhile, the unique layered structure is beneficial to the contact of the active material and electrolyte, and the reversibility of conversion reaction has also been improved. Furthermore, kinetics analysis reveals a pseudocapacitance-dominated Li+-storage mechanism at high rates. In-situ X-ray diffraction analysis discloses that the conversion reaction has played a certain part in Li+-storage. Thus, the GeSe2/N-rGO composite delivers excellent rate capability and good long-term stability with a high reversible capacity of 711.0 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1.",Chemistry - A European Journal

Inhibited shuttle effect by functional separator for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022According to a statistic, approximately 6 trillion cigarettes are smoked each year all over the world, which produces approximately 1.2 million tons of discarded cigarette butts. The discarded cigarette filters are non-biodegradable, thus they produce a mass of waste disposal and cause environmental pollution issue. For the purpose of transforming waste into wealth and reducing environmental pollution, nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon nanofiber/carbon black (N,S-CNF/CB) composite derived from the discarded cigarette filters is employed to modify glass fiber (GF) separator for the first time in this study. N,S-CNF improves binding ability towards sodium polysulfides (SPSs) by chemisorption. Non-polar CB limits the dissolution of SPSs in the liquid electrolyte by physisorption. The experiment and density functional theory calculation results indicate that a RT-Na/S battery with a N,S-CNF/CB+GF separator exhibits good cycling stability and rate performance. After 100 cycles at a low current rate of 0.1 C, a RT-Na/S battery with a sulfur mass fraction of 71% delivers a discharge capacity of 703 mAh g − 1. In addition, at a high current rate of 0.5 C, a discharge capacity of 527 mAh g − 1 is still maintained after 900 cycles with a very low capacity fading rate of 0.035% per cycle.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
A rational configuration for ultralong lifespan all-solid-state organic sodium-metal batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Organic sodium-metal batteries (OSMBs) have become one of the most promising contestants for use in energy storage systems. However, the practical applications of OSMBs are limited because the organic materials always suffer from dissolution in traditional liquid electrolytes. Using succinonitrile-based plastic crystal electrolytes (SN-based PCEs) has been proven to solve the dissolution issue. Herein, 5 mol% NaClO4/SN PCE was first selected to match the high theoretical specific capacity cathode pillar[5]quinone (P5Q) to assemble sodium-metal batteries. This electrolyte synergistically achieves high ion conduction and high decomposition voltage. In addition, the interfacial compatibility between the electrolyte and Na anode was improved by pretreatment. Benefitting from the rational configuration, the OSMB demonstrates a specific discharge capacity of 251 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 0.2C, corresponding to an excellent capacity retention rate of 61%. Even at a high current density of 1C, the capacity still remains at 210 mA h g−1. This work has realized the ultralong lifespan of OSMB, which has important practical significance.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Understanding the Electrochemical Performance of FeS2Conversion Cathodes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Conversion cathodes represent a viable route to improve rechargeable Li+battery energy densities, but their poor electrochemical stability and power density have impeded their practical implementation. Here, we explore the impact cell fabrication, electrolyte interaction, and current density have on the electrochemical performance of FeS2/Li cells by deconvoluting the contributions of the various conversion and intercalation reactions to the overall capacity. By varying the slurry composition and applied pressure, we determine that the capacity loss is primarily due to the large volume changes during (de)lithiation, leading to a degradation of the conductive matrix. Through the application of an external pressure, the loss is minimized by maintaining the conductive matrix. We further determine that polysulfide loss can be minimized by increasing the current density (>C/10), thus reducing the sulfur formation period. Analysis of the kinetics determines that the conversion reactions are rate-limiting, specifically the formation of metallic iron at rates above C/8. While focused on FeS2, our findings on the influence of pressure, electrolyte interaction, and kinetics are broadly applicable to other conversion cathode systems.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Here, one-step and space-confine pyrolysis strategy is demonstrated to in-situ construct ultrathin MoP-MoS2 heterostructure on N, P and S co-doped hollow carbon spheres (MoP-MoS2/HCSs) that present remarkable HER performance. The intimate contact among MoP outer-layer, MoS2 intermediate layer and N, P and S co-doped HCSs inner-layer facilitates the formation of triple-shelled heterogeneous nanoreactor. Benefiting from abundant active sites, high specific surface area, heteroatomic doping, intimate catalyst-substrate contact and ultrathin active heterostructure, the resulting MoP-MoS2/HCSs not only displays significant electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials (71 mV and 125 mV in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively) at current density of 10 mA cm−2, but exhibits outstanding stability toward HER process.

A bilayer solar evaporator with all-in-one design for efficient seawater desalination,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Bilayer solar evaporator combines high photothermal conversion capacity and low heat loss, has become the new darling in interfacial solar steam generation (ISSG). However, the bilayer structure generally achieved by introducing a photothermal coating on the substrate is not conducive to long-term use due to the poor stability of coating. Herein, a fully biomass-based bilayer evaporator is all-in-one designed, using chitosan (CS) as building blocks and CS derived N, S - doped porous carbon (NSPC) as fillers via pre-freezing and freeze-drying. This facile method could realise the quantitative addition of photothermal materials and controllably regulate the structure of the bilayer evaporator, making the structural optimisation readily available. The optimised evaporator exhibits a remarkable evaporation rate of 2.51 kg m−2h−1. After 1000 times of pressing, it still maintains at 2.42 kg m−2h−1. Additionally, the evaporator displays outstanding long-lasting stability, excellent salt-resistant and degradability. More importantly, a solar desalination device is fabricated for harvesting freshwater outdoor. The daily water production per unit area (4.55 kg) meets the consumption of two adults. This work provides a controllable synthesis strategy of bilayer evaporators for handling global freshwater shortages.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
In situ perfusing Sb particles into porous N-doped carbon microspheres and their electrochemical properties in potassium ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Antimony-based materials with low platform and high theoretical capacity have been considered as a promising candidate of anode material for economical and high-performance potassium ion batteries (PIBs) in the recent decades. Unfortunately, they are still affected by the sluggish kinetics and poor cycle stability, meanwhile, the large radius of the K+ ion leads to the aggregation of particles. Herein, we developed an in-situ perfusing method to construct Sb nanoparticles into the hierarchical porous N-doped carbon (HPNC) microspheres restriction structure, which was proved to be a reasonable and efficient way to enhance the electrochemical properties. Meanwhile, it was acknowledged that electrolyte optimization (KPF6 and KFSI) exerted significant influence on greatly enhancing the electrochemical performance. With the hierarchical porous structure and the electrolyte composition design, Sb@HPNC exhibits an outstanding reversible capacity of up to 507 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 over 100 cycles and excellent long-cycle stability of 262 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 over 700 cycles.

Scalable Composites Benefiting from Transition-Metal Oxides as Cathode Materials for Efficient Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. ChemElectroChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Composite materials achieved by including transition-metal oxides with different structures and morphologies in sulfur are suggested as scalable cathodes for high-energy lithium-sulfur (Li−S) batteries. The composites contain 80 wt.% sulfur and 20 wt.% of either MnO2 or TiO2, leading to a sulfur content in the electrode of 64 wt.% and revealing a reversible, fast, and lowly polarized conversion process in the cell with limited interphase resistance. The S−TiO2 composite exhibits an excellent rate capability between C/10 and 2C, and a cycle life extended over 400 cycles at 2C, owing to the effects of the nanometric TiO2 additive in boosting the reaction kinetics. Instead, the micrometric sized particles of MnO2 partially limit the electrochemical activity of S−MnO2 to the current rate of 1C. Nevertheless, both S−MnO2 and S−TiO2 withstand a sulfur loading up to values approaching 6 mg cm−2, and deliver an areal capacity ranging from about 4.5 to 5.5 mAh cm−2 at C/5. The excellent performances of the metal oxide-sulfur electrodes, even at high active material loading, and the possible scalability of the synthetic pathway adopted in the work suggest that the composites are viable cathodes for next-generation Li−S batteries with high energy density and efficient electrochemical process.",ChemElectroChem
Electrocatalysis for Continuous Multi-Step Reactions in Quasi-Solid-State Electrolytes Towards High-Energy and Long-Life Aluminum–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Aluminum–sulfur (Al−S) batteries of ultrahigh energy-to-price ratios are a promising energy storage technology, while they suffer from a large voltage gap and short lifespan. Herein, we propose an electrocatalyst-boosting quasi-solid-state Al−S battery, which involves a sulfur-anchored cobalt/nitrogen co-doped graphene (S@CoNG) positive electrode and an ionic-liquid-impregnated metal–organic framework (IL@MOF) electrolyte. The Co−N4 sites in CoNG continuously catalyze the breaking of Al−Cl and S−S bonds and accelerate the sulfur conversion, endowing the Al−S battery with a shortened voltage gap of 0.43 V and a high discharge voltage plateau of 0.9 V. In the quasi-solid-state IL@MOF electrolytes, the shuttle effect of polysulfides has been inhibited, which stabilizes the reversible sulfur reaction, enabling the Al−S battery to deliver 820 mAh g−1 specific capacity and 78 % capacity retention after 300 cycles. This finding offers novel insights to design Al−S batteries for stable energy storage.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
A Review on the Construction of Carbon-Based Metal Compound Composite Cathode Materials for Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2022 Wang, Guo, Yang, Jin, Chen and Wang.Room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries are one of the most attractive energy storage systems due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and ultra-high energy density.

Interfacial Engineering with a Nanoparticle-Decorated Porous Carbon Structure on β″-Alumina Solid-State Electrolytes for Molten Sodium Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.We present a novel anode interface modification on the β″-alumina solid-state electrolyte that improves the wetting behavior of molten sodium in battery applications. Heat treating a simple slurry, composed only of water, acetone, carbon black, and lead acetate, formed a porous carbon network decorated with PbOx(0 ≤ x ≤ 2) nanoparticles between 10 and 50 nm. Extensive performance analysis, through impedance spectroscopy and symmetric cycling, shows a stable, low-resistance interface for close to 6000 cycles. Furthermore, an intermediate temperature Na-S cell with a modified β″-alumina solid-state electrolyte could achieve an average stable cycling capacity as high as 509 mA h/g. This modification drastically decreases the amount of Pb content to approximately 3% in the anode interface (6 wt % or 0.4 mol %) and could further eliminate the need for toxic Pb altogether by replacing it with environmentally benign Sn. Overall, in situ reduction of oxide nanoparticles created a high-performance anode interface, further enabling large-scale applications of liquid metal anodes with solid-state electrolytes.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
A lignin-derived flexible porous carbon material for highly efficient polyselenide and sodium regulation,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Low-cost and sustainable sodium-selenium (Na-Se) batteries are promising energy storage media for the advancement of electromobility and large-scale energy storage. However, the sluggish kinetics of Se cathodes and the unpredictable metal electrodeposition of Na at the anode remain critical challenges. In this work, we reveal the catalytic effect of atomic Fe on the conversion of polyselenides (SPSs) to Na2Se by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Then, we prepare a lignin-derived flexible porous carbon matrix loaded with atomic Fe (Fe-BC/rGO, BC: lignin-derived porous carbon material; rGO: reduced graphene oxide) as a Se host to further verify the DFT calculation results. Due to the encapsulation of Se into the porous carbon matrix, the catalytic effect of atomic Fe on the conversion of SPSs to Na2Se and the continuous electron/ion transportation path, the prepared Se@Fe-BC/rGO cathode can deliver a high reversible capacity of 213 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1, which is much better than the electrochemical performance of a Se cathode without atomic Fe loading (Se@BC/rGO). In addition, we further reveal the advantageous effect of the presence of the Fe-BC/rGO film in regulating the interfacial Na electrodeposition at the anode. Due to the porous structure and the catalytic effect of atomic Fe, a very low nucleation overpotential of 15.3 mV is achieved at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, which is much lower than that of the BC/rGO film. Therefore, this work provides a low-cost and sustainable strategy for simultaneously solving the challenges of the Se cathode and the Na metal anode for future Na-Se batteries.",Nanoscale
Function-directed design of battery separators based on microporous polyolefin membranes,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Separators in batteries have a great influence on their performance and safety, where both the properties of the separator and the separator-electrode interfaces affect ion diffusion. Microporous polyolefin membranes (MPM) with excellent properties are widely used as separators in commercial lithium batteries. However, MPM separators still suffer from serious thermal shrinkage and poor wettability, which lead to safety hazards and poor electrochemical performances. Furthermore, MPM separators cannot meet the higher requirements of next-generation high-energy-density batteries. With the fast progress in battery studies, researchers have gradually recognized that the separator is a favorable platform to address the key challenges of batteries. In this review, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art research on the function-directed design of MPM separators. Firstly, we briefly present the challenges associated with conventional MPM separators. Then, we summarize the methods for the preparation of MPM-based functional separators. Subsequently, we highlight the main functions of MPM separators including improving the wettability of liquid electrolytes, enhancing the thermal stability, inhibiting the shuttling of intermediate products and stabilizing metal anodes. Finally, we present a summary and future outlook of MPM-based functional separators. Insights from this review show that MPM-based functional separators can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance and safety of batteries. Also, the rational design of advanced separators will play an increasingly important role in the future development of next-generation high-energy-density batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Nickel polyphthalocyanine with electronic localization at the nickel site for enhanced CO2 reduction reaction,"© 2022 The AuthorsNickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) can be at first glance a compelling catalyst for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) because of its Ni–N4 site. Unfortunately, the pristine NiPc possesses a low catalytic activity resulting from the poor CO2 adsorption and activation capabilities of the electron-deficiency Ni site. Herein, we develop nickel polyphthalocyanine (NiPPc) with extended conjugation to tailor the electronic density at the Ni active site. The enlarged π conjugation of NiPPc evokes the d-electrons localization, increasing the electronic density at the Ni site, which enhances its CO2 adsorption and activation. Consequently, NiPPc supported on carbon nanotubes (NiPPc/CNT) in a flow cell delivers an excellent activity of −300 mA cm−2 for CO2RR with the CO selectivity of 99.8%, which is much higher than that of NiPc dispersed on carbon nanotubes. NiPPc/CNT exhibits an outstanding stability for CO2RR of more than 30 h at a current density of −100 mA cm−2 with an ultrahigh selectivity for CO, exceeding 99.7%. This work showcases a new way of tuning the electronic density of catalytic sites.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

Improving Lithium-Sulfur Batteries' Performance via Inverse Vulcanization of Vinylene-Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with one-dimensional (1D) pores are capable of sulfur encapsulation; however, the physical absorption leads to an insufficient suppression on the shuttle of lithium polysulfides that ultimately cripples the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, we prepared two vinylene-linked COFs bearing different pores, denoted as COF-1 and COF-2. Interestingly, COF-1 can only physically isolate sulfur to give S-COF-1, while the polysulfide chains can be covalently linked to the framework of COF-2 via inverse vulcanization to produce S-COF-2. S-COF-1 and S-COF-2 deliver superior capacities of 1179 and 1293 mAh g-1 at 0.2C, an outstanding rate performance (331 and 692 mA h g-1 at 3C), and a prolonged cycling life span (a low declining value of 0.09% per cycle at 1C for S-COF-2). Due to the synergistic effect of covalent linking and physical confinement of sulfur, S-COF-2 features a superior LSBs performance compared to S-COF-1. Our studies provide a strategy for improving the performances of LSBs by combining the chemical and physical installation of sulfur.",Energy and Fuels

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Li-S batteries are ideal candidates to replace current lithium-ion batteries as next-generation energy storage systems thanks to their high specific capacity and theoretical energy density. Composite electrodes based on carbon microstructures are often used as a host for sulfur. However, sulfur lixiviation, insoluble species formation, and how to maximize the sulfur-carbon contact in looking for improved electrochemical performance are still major challenges. In this study, a nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon is used as a host for sulfur. The S/C composite electrodes are prepared by sulfur melting-diffusion process at 155◦ C. The effect of the sulfur melting-diffusion time [sulfur infiltration time] (1–24 h) and sulfur content (10–70%) is investigated by using XRD, SEM, TEM and TGA analyses and correlated with the electrochemical performance in Li-S cells. S/C composite electrode with homogeneous sulfur distribution can be reached with 6 h of sulfur melting-diffusion and 10 wt.% of sulfur content. Li-S cell with this composite shows a high use of sulfur and sufficient electronic conductivity achieving an initial discharge capacity of 983 mA h g−1 and Coulombic efficiency of 99% after 100 cycles.",Batteries
Recent Advancements in Chalcogenides for Electrochemical Energy Storage Applications,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Energy storage has become increasingly important as a study area in recent decades. A growing number of academics are focusing their attention on developing and researching innovative materials for use in energy storage systems to promote sustainable development goals. This is due to the finite supply of traditional energy sources, such as oil, coal, and natural gas, and escalating regional tensions. Because of these issues, sustainable renewable energy sources have been touted as an alternative to nonrenewable fuels.

To overcome these challenges, this paper reports an in situ approach to encapsulate the solid-state sulfur cathode with a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). The GPE is covalently bonded with the sulfide solid electrolyte and acts as a barrier that suppresses chemical decomposition between the sulfide solid electrolyte and cathode active material.

Conversion Kinetics and Ionic Conductivity in Na-β”-Alumina + YSZ (Naβ”AY) Sodium Solid Electrolyte via Vapor Phase Conversion Process,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Sodium ion batteries have been receiving increasing attention and may see potential revival in the near future, particularly in large-scale grid energy storage coupling with wind and solar power generation, due to the abundant sodium resources, low cost, and sufficiently high energy density. Among the known sodium ion conductors, the Na-β”-alumina electrolyte remains highly attractive because of its high ionic conductivity. This study focuses on the vapor phase synthesis of a Na-β”-Alumina + YSZ (Naβ”AY) composite sodium electrolyte, which has higher mechanical strength and stability than conventional single phase β”-Alumina. The objectives are the measurement of conversion kinetics through a newly developed weight-gain based model and the determination of sodium ionic conductivity in the composite electrolyte. Starting samples contained ~70 vol% α-Alumina and ~30 vol% YSZ (3 mol% Y2O3 stabilized Zirconia) with and without a thin alumina surface layer made by sintering in air at 1600◦C. The sintered samples were placed in a powder of Na-β”-alumina and heat-treated at 1250◦C for various periods. Sample dimensions and weight were measured as a function of heat treatment time. The conversion of α-Alumina in the α-Alumina + YSZ composite into Naβ”AY occurred by coupled diffusion of sodium ions through Na-β”-alumina and of oxygen ions through YSZ, effectively diffusing Na2O. From the analysis of the time dependence of sample mass and dimensions, the effective diffusion coefficient of Na2O through the sample, De f f, was estimated to be 1.74 × 10−7 cm2 s−1, and the effective interface transfer parameter, ke f f, was estimated as 2.33 × 10−6 cm s−1. By depositing a thin alumina coating layer on top of the bulk composite, the chemical diffusion coefficient of oxygen through single phase Na-β”-alumina was estimated as 4.35 × 10−10 cm2 s−1. An AC impedance measurement was performed on a fully converted Naβ”AY composite, and the conductivity of the composite electrolyte was 1.3 × 10−1 S cm−1 at 300°C and 1.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25°C, indicating promising applications in solid state or molten salt batteries at low to intermediate temperatures.",Membranes
Nanomaterials for next generation energy storage applications,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Materials Research Society.Storing energy in an efficient and convenient way is one of the main areas of research recently that attract the researchers around the globe. With the continuous emphasis on producing environmental friendly renewable energy from solar panels, wind power generators and heat sources, it is more important now to have more diversified and improved energy storage or converting devices to make the whole system more efficient and cost effective. With nanometer scale dimensions, unique optical and electronic properties and large electrochemically active surface, nanomaterials can be a suitable candidate for the next generation energy storage devices. High electronic and ionic conductivities combined with intrinsic strength and flexibility of low-dimensional materials allows ultrathin, flexible, and structural energy storage solutions. QDs have high specific surface area (SSA) due to which when embedded in other materials electrolytes can penetrate easily which is advantageous for high energy/power density applications. The Lithium Ion Batteries (LIBs) are first-class power source devices for electric energy storage and electric vehicles due to their high capacity, long cycle life, and environmental friendliness, however, they have intrinsic poor electrical conductivity, low Li+ diffusion rate in pure materials, and the endless generation and fracture of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). By decreasing the size of the anode to quantum dot scale the disadvantage of a long diffusion length of Li+ can be overcome. Metal oxide nanostructures such as SnO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles are promising alternate as electrode material for LIB. Si quantum dots with size below 5 nm and monodisperse characteristics are suitable materials for Si/C nanocomposites in LIBs. Apart from these several other QDs shows significant potential as important components for next generation energy storage applications.

Formation of Passivate Interphases by Na3BS3-Glass Solid Electrolytes in All-Solid-State Sodium-Metal Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Interphase formation at the interface between a solid electrolyte and negative electrode is one of the main factors limiting the practical use of all-solid-state sodium batteries. Sulfide-type solid electrolytes with group 15 elements (P and Sb) exhibit high ductility and ionic conductivity, comparable to those of organic liquid electrolytes. However, the electronically conductive interphase formed at the interface between Na3PS4and sodium metal increases the cell resistance and deteriorates its electrochemical properties. Contrarily, Na3BS3, containing boron as an electrochemically inert element, forms an electronically insulating thin passivate interphase, facilitating reversible sodium plating and stripping. Sodium-metal symmetric cells with Na3BS3exhibit steady operation over 1000 cycles. Thus, reduction-stable solid electrolytes can be developed by substitution with an electrochemically inert element versus sodium.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

In Situ Fabrication of Porous CoxP Hierarchical Nanostructures on Carbon Fiber Cloth with Exceptional Performance for Sodium Storage,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Superior high-rate performance and ultralong cycling life have been constantly pursued for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a facile strategy is employed to successfully synthesize porous CoxP hierarchical nanostructures supported on a flexible carbon fiber cloth (CoxP@CFC), constructing a robust architecture of ordered nanoarrays. Via such a unique design, porous and bare structures can thoroughly expose the electroactive surfaces to the electrolyte, which is favorable for ultrafast sodium-ion storage. In addition, the CFC provides an interconnected 3D conductive network to ensure firm electrical connection of the electrode materials. Besides the inherent flexibility of the CFC, the integration of the hierarchical structures of CoxP with the CFC, as well as the strong synergistic effect between them, effectively help to buffer the mechanical stress caused by repeated sodiation/desodiation, thereby guaranteeing the structural integrity of the overall electrode. Consequently, CoxP@CFC as an anode shows a record-high capacity of 279 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 with almost no capacity attenuation after 9000 cycles.",Advanced Materials
Regulating Dendrite-Free Zinc Deposition by Red Phosphorous-Derived Artificial Protective Layer for Zinc Metal Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Rational architecture design of the artificial protective layer on the zinc (Zn) anode surface is a promising strategy to achieve uniform Zn deposition and inhibit the uncontrolled growth of Zn dendrites. Herein, a red phosphorous-derived artificial protective layer combined with a conductive N-doped carbon framework is designed to achieve dendrite-free Zn deposition. The Zn–phosphorus (ZnP) solid solution alloy artificial protective layer is formed during Zn plating. Meanwhile, the dynamic evolution mechanism of the ZnP on the Zn anode is successfully revealed. The concentration gradient of the electrolyte on the electrode surface can be redistributed by this protective layer, thereby achieving a uniform Zn-ion flux. The fabricated Zn symmetrical battery delivers a dendrite-free plating/stripping for 1100 h at the current density of 2.0 mA cm–2. Furthermore, aqueous Zn//MnO2 full cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 200 mAh g–1 after 350 cycles at 1.0 A g–1.

Ten micrometer thick polyethylene separator modified by α-LiAlO2@γ-Al2O3 nanosheets for simultaneous suppression of Li dendrite growth and polysulfide shuttling in Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are of considerable interest for low-cost and high-density energy storage. However, the notorious polysulfide shuttling and the undesired Li dendrite growth impel the development of Li-S batteries. To simultaneously mitigate these problems, a thin (∼10 μm) separator is herein developed by coating α-LiAlO2@γ-Al2O3 (LAO) nanosheets on the dual sides of a commercial polyethylene (PE) separator. Owing to the high anion-anchoring capability and the polysulfide absorbing and catalytic effect of LAO, the LAO modified separator (LAOMS) not only suppresses the polysulfide shuttling, but also homogenizes Li+ flux and reduces concentration polarization. As a result, the Li-Li cell with LAOMS demonstrates an unprecedented stability over 2500 h when cycled at a high current density of 5 mA/cm2. In addition, the Li-S battery with LAOMS exhibits superior cycling lifespan with an ultra-low capacity decay of 0.037% per cycle over 1000 cycles even at 2 C, excellent rate performance, and superior anti-self-discharge capability. Our studies not only shed light on the rational design of functionalized separators for high-performance Li-S batteries, but also provide a thin separator with promising commercial perspective.",Materials Today Energy

Towards stable sodium metal battery with high voltage output through dual electrolyte design,"© 2022The application of sodium metal batteries (SMBs) is hindered by the notable challenges of side reactions between electrolyte and Na as well as the growth of Na dendrites. Herein, we report that a unique design of dual electrolytes within double separators, namely lean diglyme-based electrolyte hosted by the polypropylene separator together with sulfolane-based electrolyte hosted by the glass fiber separator (denoted as D-e@PP/S-e@GF), can effectively prevent Na dendrite growth and suppress side reactions. D-e@PP/S-e@GF ingeniously combines the advantages of D-e and S-e by using their wettability difference on separators. Finite element method (FEM) simulations and in-situ optical microscopy reveal that the D-e@PP layer promotes uniform deposition and significantly reduces side reactions. The S-e@GF layer can be paired with high voltage cathodes. D-e@PP/S-e@GF enables a high CE of Na plating/stripping as high as 97.22% over 560 cycles at 0.5 mAh cm−2 and ultra-long cycle life of more than 1900 h at 1 mAh cm−2 in Na||Na symmetric cell. Furthermore, this design also demonstrates excellent cycling stability of full cells using Na3V2(PO4) (NVP) and Prussian Blue (PB) as cathodes. The unique design of dual electrolytes within double separators provides a new and promising avenue to develop high-performance SMBs.",Energy Storage Materials
Comparative sustainability study of energy storage technologies using data envelopment analysis,"© 2022The transition to energy systems with a high share of renewable energy depends on the availability of technologies that can connect the physical distances or bridge the time differences between the energy supply and demand points. This study focuses on energy storage technologies due to their expected role in liberating the energy sector from fossil fuels and facilitating the penetration of intermittent renewable sources. The performance of 27 energy storage alternatives is compared considering sustainability aspects by means of data envelopment analysis. To this end, storage alternatives are first classified into two clusters: fast-response and long-term. The levelized cost of energy, energy and water consumption, global warming potential, and employment are common indicators considered for both clusters, while energy density is used only for fast-response technologies, where it plays a key role in technology selection. Flywheel reveals the highest efficiency between all the fast-response technologies, while green ammonia powered with solar energy ranks first for long-term energy storage. An uncertainty analysis is incorporated to discuss the reliability of the results. Overall, results obtained, and guidelines provided can be helpful for both decision-making and research and development purposes. For the former, we identify the most appealing energy storage options to be promoted, while for the latter, we report quantitative improvement targets that would make inefficient technologies competitive if attained. This contribution paves the way for more comprehensive studies in the context of energy storage by presenting a powerful framework for comparing options according to multiple sustainability indicators.",Energy Storage Materials
Effective design and synthesis of donor-acceptor covalent triazine polymers with boosted photocatalytic performance for Cr(VI) reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Two new donor–acceptor covalent triazine polymers (CTPs), namely Th-Trz (JOU-6) and Th-Ph-Trz (JOU-7), containing electron-donating thieno[2,3-b]thiophene (Th) units and electron-withdrawing triazine (Trz) units have been successfully constructed (Ph = benzene ring). The unique conjugated structure of the CTPs invokes wide absorption range and high charge transfer efficiency. Because of these advantages, the as-prepared CTPs are highly effective photocatalysts for Cr(VI) reduction. It is found that high acid concentration in the photocatalytic system may assist the protonation of triazine groups in CTPs, which not only can enhance their adsorption ability for Cr2O72−, but also can promote their charge transfer ability. Another important finding is that compared with JOU-6, JOU-7 shows more efficient charge separation owing to the introduction of benzene ring between the donor and acceptor units, inducing a spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and thereby giving a better photocatalytic performance. The spatial charge distribution of the CTPs was also investigated by theoretical calculation based on molecular orbital theory. Fascinatingly, Cr(VI) and organic pollutions can be simultaneously removed by JOU-7 without any sacrificial agents, oxidizer, or acid. This work provides a valuable strategy for the design and construction of effective photocatalysts for the removal of pollutants in wastewater.",Separation and Purification Technology
Na2S–NaI solid solution as positive electrode in all-solid-state Na/S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.All-solid-state sodium-sulfur (Na/S) batteries are promising next-generation batteries with high safety and high energy density. Sodium sulfide (Na2S) has application as active material in positive electrodes owing to its advantages such as low cost, low toxicity, and a large theoretical capacity. However, the electronic and sodium ion conductivities of Na2S are significantly low, and ascertaining the entire contribution of the active materials to cell capacities is challenging. Therefore, facilitating an electronic and ionic conduction path in the positive electrode is essential. In this study, Na2S was mixed with sodium iodide (NaI) via a mechanochemical process and was used as an active material in an all-solid-state Na/S battery. Consequently, a Na2S–NaI solid solution was formed, and the ionic conductivity of Na2S–NaI increased by five orders of magnitude compared to that of Na2S. Na2S–NaI showed large charge–discharge capacities and cycle capability. In particular, 90Na2S·10NaI showed a large capacity and high cycle efficiency, and 94% of Na2S acted as an active material. The result of this study leads to the development of all-solid-state Na/S batteries with high capacities, high rates, and high cycles.",Journal of Power Sources
Rationally designed alloy phases for highly reversible alkali metal batteries,"© 2022Alkali metal batteries (AMBs) have been recognized one of the most promising battery systems owing to the remarkable theoretical capacities and low redox potentials of alkali metals, enabling a high energy density of over 500 Wh kg−1. However, the problematic dendrite growth and huge volume variation during the iterative plating/stripping processes lead to inferior Coulombic efficiency, short lifespan, and even safety issues. Constructing metal alloy-based phases in the bulk or on the surface of alkali metals has been proved to be effective for improving the cyclic stability and longevity of AMBs. This review reports recent developments in the creation of alloy phases for reversible alkali metal plating/stripping.

Moreover, it can be extended to other polymer backbones and incorporated with other cathodes for improving battery performance.",Energy Storage Materials
Unlocking the Reversible Selenium Electrode for Non-Aqueous and Aqueous Calcium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Calcium-ion batteries (CIBs) have been considered promising multivalent ion battery systems due to the natural abundance and low redox potential of calcium. The practical realization is largely hampered by the lack of reliable electrode materials. Selenium is first explored as a new conversion-type electrode for both non-aqueous and aqueous CIBs. The selenium provides a specific capacity of 476 mAh g–1 with an average voltage of 2.2 V versus Ca/Ca2+ at a current density of 50 mA g–1, offering a higher energy density than other reported cathode materials. Long-term cyclic stability at a large current density of 500 mA g–1 has been achieved in non-aqueous electrolytes through encapsulating the selenium in mesoporous carbon. The spectroscopy analysis and density functional theory calculations suggest multi-step conversion processes involving CaSe4 and Ca2Se5 polyselenides intermediates before reaching the final CaSe phase, exhibiting a distinct reaction pathway from those in other metal-Se batteries. Furthermore, the application of selenium is extended to the aqueous electrolyte after expanding the electrochemical window. A 1.1 V class aqueous CIB is demonstrated by coupling with a Cu-based Prussian blue electrode. The discovery of reversible Ca–Se chemistry opens new opportunities for emerging CIBs.",Advanced Functional Materials

SILs are prepared by varying NaClO4 in triglyme (G3), immobilized in poly(vinylidene-fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) to yield SIL-GPEs as free-standing, flexible films. The morphology/structural and salt-glyme-polymer interactions in SIL-GPEs are studied from SEM, X-ray diffraction, FTIR/Raman and TG analyses.

It inherits the intrinsic merit of low lost, low toxicity and low energy consumption for recycling and delivers the theoretical capacity of 3350 mAh g−1 (based on the mass of sulfur) while its further development is restrained by copper-dendrite. We firstly take actions to protect Cu metal anode from dendrite guaranteeing the sustainability of delivering high capacity. Concretely, we apply three-dimensional carbon paper as substrate and then creatively introduce polyacrylonitrile on its surface to generate controllable C-N affinity coupling sites as verified by density functional theory. These active sites bring observable potential difference on carbon paper boosting uniform distribution of electric field and dendrite-free copper deposition. Applying this material as anode, aqueous Cu-S battery can achieve a discharge specific capacity of 2745.9 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 and still maintain the reversible capacity of 1303.3 mAh g−1 after 1200 cycles.",Energy Storage Materials
Theoretical evaluation and experimental design of nitrogen doped porous carbon from Cu-based metal-organic frameworks for lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022Carbon-based materials are potential alternatives to electrode materials of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). As defect sites in carbon materials greatly affect their physical and chemical properties, it's imperative to explore them in carbon-based electrodes. However, the influence mechanism of the influence of different defects in terms of lithium storage capacity is still elusive, which hinders the relevant development consequently. As such, this paper summarized the construction and adsorption of nitrogen-doped defects through a first-principles calculation system, and analyzed the mechanism of satisfactory performances of nitrogen-doped electrode materials by studying the adsorption energy, electron densities, and diffusion barrier characteristics of different types of defects. The results revealed that pyridine nitrogen and pyrrole nitrogen could improve the adsorption performance of lithium by altering the electron density of the graphene plane. Additionally, in this paper, Cu3(BTC)2 with an octahedron shape was utilized as the precursor to prepare un-doped and nitrogen-doped carbon materials respectively. Eventually, the MOF-derived carbon had a rich mesoporous structure, which was conducive to the migration and storage of Li+, and it was used to illustrate the accuracy of the calculation results.",Surfaces and Interfaces
Poly (vinyl ethylene carbonate)-based dual-salt gel polymer electrolyte enabling high voltage lithium metal batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Rechargeable lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have been regarded as one of the most promising next-generation energy-storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density. However, the practical application of LMBs is greatly impeded by poor high-voltage tolerance and safety concerns originated from flammable organic carbonate-based liquid electrolytes.

Stable interfacial layers are rich in B-, F-, components on both the Li metal anode and high-voltage LiCoO2 cathode, realizing excellent cycling stability in Li||Li symmetrical cells, and a capacity retention of 83.42% over 100 cycles with average Coulombic efficiency of 99.86% in Li||LiCoO2 cell.",Chemical Engineering Journal
In Operando Closed-cell Transmission Electron Microscopy for Rechargeable Battery Characterization: Scientific Breakthroughs and Practical Limitations,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdDevelopment of high-performance rechargeable batteries is hinged on a clear mechanistic understanding of the fundamental electrochemical processes. In operando transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provides a nanoscale insight into the dynamic microstructural evolution of battery components. The open-cell and closed-cell are the main configurations for in situ/operando TEM battery studies. While the open-cell configuration uses an ionic liquid or a solid electrolyte, the closed-cell configuration adopts a dynamic flow of a liquid electrolyte. As such, the processes observed in the closed-cell configuration more reliably reflect the electrochemical setup in most ion batteries under development. This also permits the observation of processes such as dendritic growth and solid electrolyte interphase formation, which cannot be observed in the open-cell configuration. However, the benefits of the closed-cell configuration come at the cost of imaging resolution. In this review, the opportunities and obstacles for current closed-cell in operando TEM systems is explored. This is done by highlighting and comparing the key findings between closed-cell and open-cell configurations where possible. These include Li-ion (LIBs) and the state-of-the-art Li-O2, Na-ion (NIBs), Na-O2 and Ca-ion batteries. Furthermore, the closed-cell in operando testing conditions are systematically consolidated including information on electrodes, electrolyte and flow parameters, TEM beam conditions and cell membrane thickness. This information is critical in ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of the experimental work. Finally, we address the challenges still faced with closed-cells and deliver future perspectives of in situ/operando TEM in rechargeable battery characterization.",Nano Energy
Atomically dispersed Sn incorporated into carbon matrix for stable electrochemical lithium storage,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Although possessing a high specific capacity, the practical implementation of SnO2 nanoparticles as a promising anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is hampered by their poor cyclability. This work demonstrates that incorporating single atomic Sn (SASn) species into a carbon matrix can address this issue effectively. The SASn/C composite was synthesized via polymerization of formaldehyde and 3-aminophenol in the presence of Tin(II) chloride, followed by pyrolysis. The SASn atoms were homogeneously dispersed in the carbon matrix. Each Sn atom coordinated with two O and two C atoms, forming the Sn-O-C and Sn-C bonds, providing channels for fast electron/ion transfer and boosting electrochemical kinetics. The SASn/C anode exhibited unique lithium storage behaviors, enhanced lithium storage capability, and excellent cyclic stability with a capacity fading rate of 0.0031% per cycle at 1000 mA g−1 after 7000 cycles. Density functional theory calculations reveal that one SASn atom can adsorb three Li+ ions at the fully discharged state during the discharging process. Subsequently, the Li+ ions are directly desorbed from the SASn atom, which is different from the traditional multi-step de-alloying process. This facile strategy represents a significant advancement in developing high-performance Sn-based anode materials for LIBs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Building ultra-stable K–Te battery by molecular regulation,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesTellurium (Te) is an ideal electrode for potassium ion batteries (PIBs) owing to its excellent electronic conductivity and high volumetric capacity. However, the Te electrode is prone to capacity fading as the shuttle effect. To address this challenge, we propose molecular regulated Se–Te solid solutions on N-doped porous carbon as the PIBs electrode. After optimizing the Se content in Se–Te solid solutions, the resultant SeTe6.8 on N-doped porous carbon (SeTe6.8@C) delivered a capacity of over 400 mAh g−1 with a flat plateau of 1.0 V at 500 mA g−1. It also achieved a superiorly long cycle life, running for more than 1600 cycles (over 7 months with 0.015% degeneration per cycle) at 100 mA g−1 and excellent rate performance (179.9 mAh g−1 at 10000 mA g−1). This remarkable electrochemical energy storage of the Te electorde likely arises from suppression of the shuttle effect after doping the Te with strongly electronegative Se atoms (forming K5Te3 which is not easily soluble in electrolyte). This study presents a fresh approach for designing and developing ultra-stable Te-based electrodes for PIBs and beyond.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

Understanding the interaction of N-doped graphene and sulfur compounds in a lithium-sulfur battery: a density functional theory investigation,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe generalized gradient approximation (GGA) density functional theory (DFT), Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh (PBE), and long-range corrected DFT (ωB97XD) were used to investigate the interaction between lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx, x = 2-8) and N-doped graphene to understand the adsorption mechanism and effect of catalytic conversion, including the reduction from S8 to Li2S and Li2S decomposition. The binding of Li2Sx to N-doped graphene was significantly stronger than that to solvents, such as 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), approximately by 0.5-3.0 eV, indicating that N-doped graphenes possessed the ability to trap soluble Li2Sx. The binding of Li2Sx to N-doped graphenes followed the order of pyrrolic N > pyridinic N > graphene > graphitic N. Among them, pyrrolic N exhibited the strongest anchoring effect mainly via forming the coordination bond of LiN3. In addition, in all the investigated systems, the van der Waals force also played an important role in binding. We comprehensively analyzed the micro-nano-scale theoretical data, including charge, bond distance, bond order, electron density difference, the electron localization function (ELF), and the independent gradient model (IGM) of the Li ion and N atom. The strength of the Li-N bond confirmed that the strongest anchoring occurred when the Li ion was trapped above the vacancy-forming coordination bond rather than a regular covalent bond. Although the strength of Li-N binding had a direct effect on the binding energy, other thermodynamic parameters (free energy and dissociation energy) of catalytic conversion and the energy barrier of Li2S phase transformation also showed a similar capacity.",New Journal of Chemistry
Effects of Flexible Group Length of Phosphonate Monomers on the Performance of Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Sodium-Ion Batteries with Ultralong Cycling Life,"© 2022 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.Using gel polymer electrolytes instead of liquid electrolytes is one of the methods to avoid safety hazards such as leakage, decomposition, and dendrite growth caused by conventional electrolytes. In this work, a series of functional monomers of methyl phosphonate with different flexible-group chain lengths are devised and synthesized. On the basis of these phosphonates, the gel copolymer electrolytes are obtained by in situ thermal copolymerization with trifluoroethyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate. All gel copolymer electrolytes have excellent thermal stabilities, wide electrochemical stable windows (≥5.0 V vs Na/Na+), and adequate ionic conductivities (>1.4 × 10-3 S cm-1), and the sodium ion conduction mechanism is discussed and supplemented by a theoretical calculation. The assembled Na3V2(PO4)3/Na batteries with gel copolymer electrolytes all have better ultralong cycling stabilities than liquid cells with higher capacity retentions above 76% after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the Na3V2(PO4)3/GPE1-GPE3/Na batteries with shorter lengths of flexible-group chains have much better cycling stabilities and much higher capacity retentions up to 87% after 5000 cycles, and the Na3V2(PO4)3/GPE1-GPE2/Na batteries with shorter lengths of flexible-group chains have better rate performance than GPE4-based batteries with longer chain lengths. In addition, the polarization properties, the interfacial compositions obtained by XPS, and the morphology characterizations of separators after cycling show that the gel polymer electrolytes with short-chain monomers have better interfacial stabilities and better capabilities of inhibiting decomposition of liquid electrolytes. In summary, the influence of multifunctional phosphonate monomers with different chain lengths on battery performance is studied in detail, and the structure-activity relationships of phosphonate-based gel polymer electrolytes are discussed. That provides a reference for the design and preparation of gel polymer electrolytes with better performance.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering

The studies are not only about the battery technology, the cathode materials that reveal these properties have also been getting great attention. Polyanionic compound-based electrodes offer a new perspective for improving and achieving higher capacity and energy/power density, safety, and long-life cycle stability of sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). However, in recent years, phosphate-based cathode compounds for NIBs have attracted great interest because of their improved structural diversity, stability, high ionic mobility, and better safety. This review article analyzes the recent advancements in the crystal structures of different explored Na-based phosphate compounds, their ion diffusion mechanisms, and the study of multi-electron reactions. The types of NASICONs Na-based phosphate compounds, which include orthophosphates, pyrophosphates, phosphates, and mixed phosphates, are also discussed with their drawbacks and benefits. The low electronic conductivity and moderately low-capacity performance of this class of materials are the major drawbacks to their advancement and application in NIBs.

The detailed analysis of crystal structures and the multi-electron reaction of phosphate-based materials are discussed. Different strategies have been discussed for enhancing their electrochemical properties, such as synthetic methodologies, compounding, and nano-structuring, which will provide insight into the important progress made in these materials and better guidance for polyanionic phosphate-based cathode materials for NIBs.",Sustainable Energy and Fuels

All rights reserved.Carbon materials with the merits of superior conductivity and wide available resources have emerged as promising anode candidates for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the inferior capacitance and the limited interlayer spacing restrain their practical application. Herein, we report an atom-adjustable doping strategy to fabricate the N/P dual-doped porous carbon nanosheet anodes (NP-PCN) via the in situ pyrolysis of supermolecules. Nitrogen atoms and phosphorus atoms are introduced to the skeleton with the monomers assembled incrementally.

Hierarchical Confinement Effect with Zincophilic and Spatial Traps Stabilized Zn-Based Aqueous Battery,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Zn-based aqueous batteries (ZABs) have been regarded as promising candidates for safe and large-scale energy storage in the ""post-Li"" era. However, kinetics and stability problems of Zn capture cannot be concomitantly regulated, especially at high rates and loadings. Herein, a hierarchical confinement strategy is proposed to design zincophilic and spatial traps through a host of porous Co-embedded carbon cages (denoted as CoCC). The zincophilic Co sites act as preferred nucleation sites with low nucleation barriers (within 0.5 mA h cm-2), and the carbon cage can further spatially confine Zn deposition (within 5.0 mA h cm-2). Theoretical simulations and in situ/ex situ structural observations reveal the hierarchical spatial confinement by the elaborated all-in-one network (within 12 mA h cm-2). Consequently, the elaborate strategy enables a dendrite-free behavior with excellent kinetics (low overpotential of ca. 65 mV at a high rate of 20 mA cm-2) and stable cycle life (over 800 cycles), pushing forward the next-generation high-performance ZABs.",Nano Letters

Herein, a novel composite electrolyte material comprising perovskite Li0.485La0.505TiO3 (LLTO), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and a barium titanate (BTO)-polyimide (PI) composite matrix has been successfully fabricated. Benefiting from the well-defined ion channels, the resulting BTO-PI@LLTO-PEO-FEC-LiTFSI (BP@LPFL) exhibits excellent cycling stability, low interfacial resistance, enhanced mechanical strength, and high ionic conductivity.

Enhanced catalysis of radical-to-polysulfide interconversion via increased sulfur vacancies in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is seriously hindered by severe lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling and sluggish electrochemical conversions. Herein, the Co9S8/MoS2 heterojunction as a model cathode host material is employed to discuss the performance improvement strategy and elucidate the catalytic mechanism. The introduction of sulfur vacancies can harmonize the chemisorption of the heterojunction component. Also, sulfur vacancies induce the generation of radicals, which participate in a liquidus disproportionated reaction to reduce the accumulation of liquid LiPSs. To assess the conversion efficiency from liquid LiPSs to solid Li2S, a new descriptor calculated from basic cyclic voltammetry curves, nucleation transformation ratio, is proposed.",Chemical Science

Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.Improving the flame retardant and electrochemical properties of electrolytes is of great significance to enhance the safety of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this work, the effect of cresyl diphenyl phosphate (CDP), dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP), trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPP) as flame retardant additives in the standard electrolyte on the performance of LiFePO4/Li cell are comprehensively studied. The results show that when the mass fraction of flame retardant is less than 20%, the purpose of flame retardant can be achieved in the electrolyte.

Phase Relations in a NaFeO2-SnO2 (0–50 mol.% SnO2) System and the Crystal Structure and Conductivity of Na0.8 Fe0.8 Sn0.2 O2,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.With the view of developing new materials for sodium and sodium-ion power sources, NaFeO2-SnO2 (0–50 mol.% SnO2) powders were synthesized using a solid state method, and their phase composition and crystal structure were studied. A phase of the Na0.8 Fe0.8 Sn0.2 O2 composition with a layered rhombohedral structure of the α-NaFeO2 type was found when the tin dioxide content was 20 mol.%. The phase produced was of an O3 structural type. O3-type phases have sufficiently good performance when used as cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries and, moreover, often have a rather high sodium-cation conductivity. A two-dimensional migration map was built using Voronoi– Dirichlet partition and TOPOS software package. The sodium-ion conductivity of Na0.8 Fe0.8 Sn0.2 O2 at room temperature was rated low (10−8 S × cm−1 at 20◦ C), which may be the result of channels too narrow for Na+ migration. The results obtained show that the application of the compound studied in this work as a solid electrolyte in sodium power sources is unlikely. It is the potential use of Na0.8 Fe0.8 Sn0.2 O2 as the active material of cathodes in Na and Na-ion power sources that presents practical interest.",Materials
Investigating the Origin of the Enhanced Sodium Storage Capacity of Transition Metal Sulfide Anodes in Ether-Based Electrolytes,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Although ether-based electrolytes have gradually been identified as a vital factor to achieving the excellent electrochemical performance observed in transition metal sulfide (TMS) anodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), there is still a lack of a fundamental understanding about the origin of the positive effect of ether-based electrolytes on TMS anodes. Herein, a microspherical CoS2 anode has been taken as a representative of TMS. It has been demonstrated that the sodiation process involves not only a traditional conversion reaction taking place between solid-state CoS2 and Na2S, but also a solid–liquid phase conversion process between active materials and soluble sodium polysulfide (Na2Sn, 2 < n < 8). More importantly, it is first revealed that the long-term stability and the reversibility of CoS2 anode are mainly due to the solid–liquid conversion behavior, which makes bulk CoS2 gradually develop into a stable porous structure with fast Na+ transport kinetics and small stress/strain during cycling. Consequently, the CoS2 electrode delivers remarkable long-cycle life with an ultrahigh capacity retention rate of 94.8% even after 1500 cycles at 2 A g−1 (only 2.13 mAh g−1 fading per 100 cycles) and high volumetric capacity of 949 mAh cm−3 at a high active material loading of 3.3 mg cm−2.",Advanced Functional Materials

Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, although a promising candidate of next-generation energy storage devices, are hindered by some bottlenecks in their roadmap toward commercialization. The key challenges include solving the issues such as low utilization of active materials, poor cyclic stability, poor rate performance, and unsatisfactory Coulombic efficiency due to the inherent poor electrical and ionic conductivity of sulfur and its discharged products (e.g., Li2S2 and Li2S), dissolution and migration of polysulfide ions in the electrolyte, unstable solid electrolyte interphase and dendritic growth on anodes, and volume change in both cathodes and anodes. Owing to the high specific surface area, pore volume, low density, good chemical stability, and particularly multimodal pore sizes, hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) materials have received considerable attention for circumventing the above problems in Li–S batteries. Herein, recent progress made in the synthetic methods and deployment of HPC materials for various components including sulfur cathodes, separators and interlayers, and lithium anodes in Li–S batteries is presented and summarized.

Unraveling the Conversion Evolution on Solid-State Na–SeS2 Battery via In Situ TEM,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.All-solid-state (ASS) Na–S batteries are promising for a large-scale energy-storage system owing to numerous merits. However, the high conversion reaction barrier impedes their practical application. In this work, the basic mechanism on how Se catalyzes the conversion reaction in the Na–S batteries is unraveled. The sodiation/desodiation of Na–SeS2 nanobatteries are systematically evaluated via in situ transmission electron microscopy (in situ TEM) with a microheating device. The real-time analyses reveal an amorphous Na–SexSy intermediate phase appears during the direct conversion from SeS2 to Na2S, and a reverse reaction succeeds at 100 °C with a prior formation of Se. The absence of polysulfides and a much lower desodiation temperature in contrast to Na–S nanobatteries demonstrate that the Se incorporation significantly lowers the conversion reaction barrier. According to these findings, the ASS SeS2 batteries using a Na3SbS4 solid electrolyte (SE) are assembled using various SE:C ratios in the composite cathodes to investigate the effect of the ion and electron transport on the electrochemical properties, including the effective transport properties, MacMullin number, and the tortuosity factor. The obtained results in turn confirm the findings from the in situ TEM. These findings are applicable to optimize other S-based active materials and improve their utilization.",Advanced Science

Dendrite-Free Lithium Deposition and Stripping Regulated by Aligned Microchannels for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Li metal is the ultimate choice for the anode in next-generation high energy density rechargeable batteries. However, undesired dendrite growth, dead Li formation, and a large volume change of the lithium metal anode lead to severe safety hazards such as short-circuiting, fire, or even explosion. Graphene oxide (GO) in large areas has been prepared as the Li metal host via a continuous centrifugal casting method. Aligned microchannels are then fabricated in it by a simple punching method using 3D printed templates. The GO matrix effectively regulates the lithium plating/stripping behavior while the aligned channels uniformly distributes the Li-ion flux and provides short Li-ion diffusion paths. The Li/ holey GO composite is flexible with a controllable thickness from 50 to 150 µm, which corresponds to capacities from 9.881 to 27.601 mAh cm−2. As a result, the anode has a low overpotential of 30 mV after 100 h, a high capacity of ≈3538 mAh g−1 (91.4% of the theoretical capacity), and a superior rate ability of up to 50 C with a LiFePO4 cathode.

Implanting Single Zn Atoms Coupled with Metallic Co Nanoparticles into Porous Carbon Nanosheets Grafted with Carbon Nanotubes for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is severely hindered by the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, an integrated composite catalyst consisting of Co nanoparticles and single-atom (SA) Zn co-implanted in nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets grafted with carbon nanotubes (Co/SA-Zn@N-C/CNTs) is rationally developed toward this challenge. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the synergistically dual active sites of Co and atomic Zn-N4 moieties with an optimal charge redistribution not only strongly confine the LiPSs but also effectively catalyze its conversion reactions by lowering the energy barrier from Li2S2 to Li2S while the N-doped porous carbon-grafted CNTs enables a large surface area for more active site exposure and provides a fast electron/ion pathway. Benefiting from synergies, Li-S batteries equipped with the Co/SA-Zn@N-C/CNTs-based sulfur cathode exhibit a high reversible capacity of 1302 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and a low capacity fading rate of 0.033% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C. Moreover, a high areal capacity of 4.5 mAh cm−2 at 0.2 C with the sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm−2 can be achieved.

Catalytic polysulfide conversion in lithium-sulfur batteries by platinum nanoparticles supported on carbonized microspheres,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) battery has attracted extensive attentions in the field of energy storage due to its high theoretical specific capacity and low cost. However, the shuttle effect restricts its energy density and cycle performance, that hinders the industrialization process of Li-S battery. The introduction of catalysis in conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is an effective strategy to suppress shuttle effect. Metal nanoparticles (NPs) are attractive catalysts due to excellent electrical conductivity and rapid electron transfer efficiency, therefore, metal NPs have great potential to be introduced in Li-S battery for studying and revealing elementary conversion reactions of LiPSs. Herein, based on the strategy of accelerating conversion of LiPSs integrated with physical confinement, we designed and synthesized Pt NPs supported on carbonized microspheres (Pt/CS composites). The catalytic conversion of LiPSs from charge transfer between Pt NPs and carbon matrix, combined with the strong physical confinement by surface pores of CS, result in upgraded electrochemical properties. It is demonstrated that the resulting Pt/CS cathode exhibits improved rate performance with specific capacity of 991.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, and maintains a fine cycling stability. This work provides a rational and facile route to construct metal supported catalytic electrode materials for Li-S battery.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Hypersensitized electrochemical detection of Hg(II) based on tunable sulfur-doped porous Co3O4 nanosheets: Promotion Co2+/Co3+ valence change cycle and adsorption via introducing S,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Doping can effectively improve the performance of materials used for electrochemical detection, but non-metallic doping is rarely used in this regard, and the related electroanalytical mechanism is still not clear. Herein, a sulfur-doped porous Co3O4 nanosheets is prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. By controlling the amount of doped S, the Co3O4 with 10 mg S-doping (named as SC10) shows rich surface defects and high ratio of Co2+/Co3+, and demonstrates an excellent detection performance toward mercury ion (Hg(II)). Decent structural features of abundant surface defects and porous sheet structure provide more active sites and help the adsorption of Hg(II). Moreover, strong interaction of S and Hg improves the combining of SC10 and Hg(II) to obtain more Hg(II) on the electrode surface additionally. Meanwhile, the facilitated Co2+/Co3+ valence change cycle could also enhance the redox of Hg(II) to Hg(0) in the square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) process. Consequently, the as-prepared SC10 modified electrode has an excellent sensitivity of 1027.46 μA μM−1 cm−2 and low LOD of 0.016 μM towards Hg(II). The SC10 shows excellent anti-interference and stability, as well as a satisfactory current response for actual water. This non-metal doped metal oxide is expected to become a promising electrode modification material.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Mixed-Valence iron phosphate as an effective catalytic host for the High-Rate Lithium-Sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur battery, one of the most attractive candidates for next-generation energy storage systems, commonly suffers from sluggish polysulfide conversion and detrimental shuttle mechanism. To solve these issues, finding novel catalytic hosts and strategies to facilitate polysulfide redox reaction is gaining much importance nowadays. Herein, we report oxidation-state-controlled amorphous FePO4 as an effective catalytic host for polysulfide conversion for the first time. For this study, we fabricated the FePO4-embedded 3D graphene composite by facile hydrothermal reaction and tailored the ratio of Fe2+/Fe3+ in the amorphous FePO4 by a thermal treatment in the reducing H2 atmosphere. A series of electrochemical tests showed that the mixed-valence FePO4 demonstrates enhanced catalytic ability than Fe3+-dominant FePO4. Surface and bandgap analyses indicate that such enhanced kinetics of mixed-valence FePO4 is attributed to the combined effects of promoted electron conduction and chemical interaction. By introducing mixed-valence FePO4 into the cathode, the battery showed robust cyclability delivering an excellent capacity of 784 mAh∙g−1 at 1C after 300 cycles (retained capacity of ∼ 78%) and superior rate performance exhibiting over 872 mAh∙g−1 at a high rate of 2C.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Synergistic Polarization Loss of MoS2-Based Multiphase Solid Solution for Electromagnetic Wave Absorption,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Given tunable hybridization structures in solid solutions, fascinating electromagnetic (EM) properties can be achieved for regulating EM wave (EMW) absorption. Herein, a novel metal–organic cooperative interactions method is proposed to manipulate the vacancy, interstitial, substitutional, and heterointerface structures in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) solid solution simultaneously, thence meeting the synergistic polarization loss on various point and face sites. Assisted by the coordination between Cu2+ and polydopamine (PDA), the effect of Cu modification on MoS2 is highly improved, which further lead to polarization loss on S vacancy, interstitial Cu, substitutional N, and heterointerface between carbon and MoS2. Contributing to the synergetic effect among multiple polarizations, the Cu/C@MoS2 solid solution exhibit ultrahigh EMW absorption performance, of which EMA with twice PDA delivers the effective absorption bandwidth of 7.12 GHz and minimum reflection loss of −48.22 dB (2.5 mm). The energy attenuation of Cu/C@MoS2 improved almost 266.7% and 222.2% than C@MoS2 and Cu@MoS2, respectively. Finally, this work reveals the structural dependency of solid solution materials of EMW absorption and establishes an entirely new polarization loss model.",Advanced Functional Materials
Driving the sodium-oxygen battery chemistry towards the efficient formation of discharge products: The importance of sodium superoxide quantification,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesSodium-oxygen batteries (SOBs) have the potential to provide energy densities higher than the state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries. However, controlling the formation of sodium superoxide (NaO2) as the sole discharge product on the cathode side is crucial to achieve durable and efficient SOBs. In this work, the discharge efficiency of two graphene-based cathodes was evaluated and compared with that of a commercial gas diffusion layer. The discharge products formed at the surface of these cathodes in a glyme-based electrolyte were carefully studied using a range of characterization techniques. NaO2 was detected as the main discharge product regardless of the specific cathode material while small amounts of Na2O2⋅2H2O and carbonate-like side-products were detected by X-ray diffraction as well as by Raman and infrared spectroscopies. This work leverages the use of X-ray diffraction to determine the actual yield of NaO2 which is usually overlooked in this type of batteries. Thus, the proper quantification of the superoxide formed on the cathode surface is widely underestimated; even though is crucial for determining the efficiency of the battery while eliminating the parasitic chemistry in SOBs. Here, we develop an ex-situ analysis method to determine the amount of NaO2 generated upon discharge in SOBs by transmission X-ray diffraction and quantitative Rietveld analysis. This work unveils that the yield of NaO2 depends on the depth of discharge where high capacities lead to very low discharge efficiency, regardless of the used cathode. We anticipate that the methodology developed herein will provide a convenient diagnosis tool in future efforts to optimize the performance of the different cell components in SOBs.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Macromolecular antioxidants for chemically durable polymer electrolyte fuel cell membranes,"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.We investigated macromolecular antioxidants to improve the stabilities of polymer electrolyte membranes during fuel cell operation. Fenton's oxidative test was conducted to screen the scavenging activities of five different antioxidants, and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy and fluoride emission, conductivity, and tensile strength analyses were employed to monitor their effects on membrane degradation. The proton conductivities and water absorption of the composite membranes were comparable to those of the pristine membrane, which may overcome issues with metal antioxidants. Moreover, open-circuit voltage (OCV) studies confirmed their positive effects during fuel operation. The OCV study showed that the membrane containing macromolecular antioxidants maintained a higher OCV than the pristine Nafion membrane, as verified by in situ analysis. Therefore, macromolecular antioxidants are useful for increasing the chemical durabilities of fuel cell membranes.",International Journal of Energy Research

The sheet-like morphology of rGO was found in the composites by FESEM images. Particles distribution was confirmed by HR-TEM. The electrochemical properties of the pure NiMoS2 and NiMoS2–rGO composites have been studied by cyclic voltammetry analysis. The results revealed that the NiMoS2/5% rGO nanocomposites exhibit high specific capacitance compared to pure NiMoS2 due to the synergistic effects of NiMoS2 and rGO in the composite material. The photocatalytic behavior of the prepared nanocomposites for dye degradation was tested. The quantity of rGO has significantly improved the photocatalytic behavior of NiMoS2/rGO composites.

The nature of electrolyte composition in terms of interaction is characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) technique. Lowering and shifting in the intensity of the bands are observed with increasing the quantity of glycerol as a plasticizer, confirming complexation between electrolyte components. Ion transport parameters are determined using both of the methods of EIS and FTIR where the parameters are found to be increased with glycerol concentration.

The maximum DC ionic conductivity value is achieved that found to be 1.63 × 10−3 S cm−1. The ESR values are ranged from 300 to 580 Ω throughout 450 cycles. The technique of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) shows the electrochemical stability window of 2 V for the conducting samples. The response of cyclic voltammetry (CV) shows an almost rectangular shape without Faradaic peaks.

In-situ observation of electrolyte-dependent interfacial change of the graphite anode in sodium-ion batteries by atomic force microscopy 原位AFM探索钠离子电池溶剂依赖型石墨界面演绎过程,"Copyright ©2022 NEW CARBON MATERIALS. All rights reserved.Graphite has proved to be inactive for Na+ storage in ester-based electrolytes when used as the anode material. Recent studies have shown the feasibility of a graphite anode for Na+ storage with a large capacity and a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) in linear ether-based electrolytes. Understanding such solvent-dependent electrochemical behavior at the nanometer scale is essential but has remained elusive, especially the direct visualization of the graphite/electrolyte interface. We report the in-situ observation by atomic force microscopy of a working battery that allowed us to monitor and visualize the changes of the graphite/electrolyte interface in both linear ether and ester-based electrolytes. Results indicate that there is no solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation in the linear ether-based electrolytes and the co-intercalation is reversible and stable in the following cycles, which are responsible for the relatively high ICE, large capacity and excellent stability. In the ester-based electrolytes, SEI deposition is obvious during the sodiation process, but not in the desodiation process, leading to a serious consumption of the electrolyte, and thus a low ICE and irreversible Na+ storage. Our findings provide insights into the dynamics of changes in the graphite/electrolyte interface and reveal the solvent-dependent Na+ storage at the nanometer scale, paving the way to develop high-performance Na+ batteries.",Xinxing Tan Cailiao/New Carbon Materials
Tuning the interfacial chemistry for stable and high energy density aqueous sodium-ion/sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryLow cost, highly safe, and environmentally benign aqueous rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (ARSIBs) are promising energy storage devices for the future. However, low cell voltage, low energy density, and inadequate cycling stability associated with low-capacity electrode materials, the restricted water stability window (1.23 V), and the inability of aqueous electrolyte to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is a major concern. In the present work, we have designed an aqueous rechargeable Na-ion/S battery, using a S@CoWO4 anode coupled with a Na-W-U-D electrolyte prepared by mixing NaClO4, urea, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in water, that exhibits a remarkable stability window of 3.1 V due to reduced water activity and stable SEI formation. The excellent anchoring ability and accelerated polysulfide redox kinetics of CoWO4 coupled with the high stability of Na-W-U-D electrolyte results in a very high capacity of 834 mA h g−1 (w.r.t sulfur) at 0.5C with 88% retention after 500 cycles. Post stability XPS and SEM studies provide evidence of a smooth and stable SEI consisting of Na2CO3, polyurea, and reduced products of DMF, which prevent polysulfide dissolution and side reactions due to water electrolysis electrolyte evaporation and dissolved oxygen. Further, a full cell assembled by integrating the S@CoWO4 anode and Na0.44MnO2 cathode in the Na-W-U-D electrolyte shows remarkable durability and delivers an energy density of 119.0 W h kg−1, demonstrating the excellent potential of the cell for scale-up and manufacturing.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
High-performance aqueous sodium-ion/sulfur battery using elemental sulfur,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Despite a promising outlook, the large-scale application of aqueous rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (ARSIBs) was impeded due to low-capacity electrode materials. Herein, we report a high capacity elemental sulfur-anode (S@NiVP/Pi-NCS) for aqueous rechargeable sodium ion/sulfur batteries using 70% of elemental sulfur, which delivers an outstanding capacity of 826 mA h g−1 at 0.5C with an excellent cycling stability even at 10C and a negligible capacity decay with 0.03% sulfur loss per cycle even after 400 cycles. The NiVP/Pi-NCS host combines the merits of fast anchoring and high conductivity of the composite to achieve smooth anchoring-diffusion and conversion of sodium polysulfide. The superior anchoring and accelerated polysulfides redox kinetics were confirmed by various electrochemical studies and in situ spectro-electrochemical analysis. Chemical interaction with vanadium provides faster redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion and efficient anchoring as revealed by XPS and was further supported by XANES and EXAFS studies wherein the distortion at the V site and overlapping electronic states in the NiVP/Pi catalyst were observed. Further, a full cell battery assembled using S@NiVP/Pi-NCS anode and Na0.44MnO2 cathode demonstrates an excellent initial capacity of 756 mA h g−1 based on S loading and 98.3 mA h g−1 based upon total electrode weight with 95% of capacity retention even after 600 cycles and a remarkable energy density of 84 W h kg−1 at 0.5C.

Nanostructure Engineering Strategies of Cathode Materials for Room-Temperature Na-S Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries are considered to be a competitive electrochemical energy storage system, due to their advantages in abundant natural reserves, inexpensive materials, and superb theoretical energy density. Nevertheless, RT Na-S batteries suffer from a series of critical challenges, especially on the S cathode side, including the insulating nature of S and its discharge products, volumetric fluctuation of S species during the (de)sodiation process, shuttle effect of soluble sodium polysulfides, and sluggish conversion kinetics.

However, the poor K+ electrochemical performance of battery-type anodes remains a challenge due to the inherent insulating property and the poor ion-transport kinetic of the anode materials. Herein, we report an integrated photoelectrode to achieve significantly enhanced K+ storage performance. The electron-hole pairs generated by the integrated photoelectrode under light-irradiation synergistically enhance the electrochemical adsorption of K+ and reversible ion-transport kinetics. Specifically, in the presence of Z907 dye that matches the energy level of the FeSe2 integrated anode, the reaction energy barrier during illumination was significantly reduced by 35.7% (∼0.05 eV). A remarkable increase in capacitance is therefore achieved to 23.8% at 3 A g−1 (under light).

Boosting electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries by cerium-based MOFs coated with polypyrrole,"© 2022Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are a promising next-generation energy storage technology due to high theoretical energy density, low cost and abundant reserves. However, the poor electronic conductivity of sulfur and huge volume change hindered their commercial applications. In this paper, selected as a cathode host of Li-S batteries from two Ce-MOFs with dissimilar open metal sites for the first time, Ce-MOF-808 was synthesized and then coated with a Polypyrrole (PPy) layer (Ce-MOF-808@S/PPy). Material characterization and electrochemical performance tests were conducted. Results show that Ce-MOF-808@S/PPy has a high specific surface area of 437.491 m2 g−1, with special micro-mesoporous structures. Ce-MOF-808@S/PPy composite possesses the initial discharge specific capacity of 1612.5 mA h g−1 and discharge specific capacity of 771.9 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C after 100 cycles. Additionally, the battery still maintains a reversible specific capacity above 470 mAh g−1 with 40% capacity retention rate at a rate of 2 C after 200 cycles of charge and discharge. Improved electrochemical performances are mainly attributed to the Ce-MOFs with special micro-mesoporous structures and high specific surface area conducive to inhibiting the shuttle effect and volume expansion through physical adsorption and stable channel structures, the Ce sites with unique adsorption and catalytic effect, and the PPy coating layer adsorbing the polysulfide and acting as charge collectors to enhance conductivity.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Quasi-Solid-State Conversion Mechanism for Sulfur Cathodes 准固相转化机制硫正极,"© 2022, Editorial Office of Progress in Chemistry. All right reserved.With the rapid development of electric vehicles and portable electronic products, the demand for high-energy-density battery systems is becoming more and more urgent. However, the energy density of traditional lithium-ion battery cathode materials is approaching the theoretical limit, thus it is urgent to develop the next-generation battery system with higher energy density. Sulfur cathodes possess lots of advantages, such as high energy density, natural abundance, and low cost, achieving extensive research attention. For the conventional dissolution-deposition mechanism, sulfur cathodes suffer from ""shuttle effect"", resulting in irreversible loss of active material, low coulomb efficiency, and poor cycle life. To alleviate the ""shuttle effect"", a series of strategies are usually adopted, for instance, physical confinement, chemical adsorption, and reaction accelerators, but none of them can fundamentally solve these problems. Recently, the quasi-solid-state conversion reaction of sulfur cathodes has attracted wide attention. This review discusses these approaches for constructing quasi-solid-state conversion reaction of sulfur cathodes, including the designs of microporous carbon structure, the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the sulfur surface, and electrolyte engineering. The research significance is highlighted and electrochemical behaviors of the quasi-solid-state conversion reaction of sulfur cathodes are summarized. Enhancing the reactivity of sulfur cathode is an effective strategy to alleviate the intrinsic sluggish kinetics of sulfur cathodes. These strategies for quasi-solid-state conversion mechanism of sulfur cathodes are beneficial to cyclability, enabling the practical development of high-performance Li-S batteries.",Progress in Chemistry
Multivalent cationic and anionic mixed redox of an Sb2S3 cathode toward high-capacity aluminum ion batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe conventional cationic redox centers of transition-metal-based cathodes are reaching their theoretical capacity limit, which cannot match the ultra-high specific capacity contributed by the three-electron transfer reaction of an Al anode (2980 mA h g−1, 8056 mA h cm−3), severely restraining the development of high-energy rechargeable Al-ion batteries (RAIBs). In this work, we propose the multivalent cationic and anionic mixed redox chemistry of Sb2S3 as a promising way out of this problem. The energy storage is induced by the cumulative Sb-related cationic (Sb(+3) ⇔ Sb(+5)) and S-related anionic (S(−2) ⇔ S(0)) mixed 10-electron transfer reversible redox reaction during the charge/discharge process, which has been elucidated here by extensive electrochemical measurements and characterizations. Furthermore, excellent electrochemical performances are realized due to the carbon-based interlayer effectively blocking the charging products of the Sb-based cationic cluster (SbCl4+), by a dual defense mechanism that integrates the physical barrier of the porous structure and the powerful chemical adsorption ability of the oxygen groups. The Sb2S3 cathode could deliver a discharge specific capacity of 756 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1.

Delicately Tailored Ternary Phosphate Electrolyte Promotes Ultrastable Cycling of Na3V2(PO4)2F3-Based Sodium Metal Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.High-voltage sodium metal batteries are a highly intriguing battery technology in view of their resource sustainability, cost efficiency, and ultrahigh energy density. However, developing a high-performance electrolyte, compatible with both high-voltage cathodes and highly reactive sodium metal anodes, is extremely challenging. In this work, we delicately formulate a ternary phosphate electrolyte, composing of a cost-effective sodium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide salt, a nonflammable triethyl phosphate (TEP) solvent, and a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) co-solvent. By rationally tailoring the TEP/FEC ratio, the ternary phosphate electrolyte displays a well-balanced performance, not only enabling highly efficient sodium deposition (an average Coulombic efficiency of 95.7% for Na//Cu cells) but also inheriting the intrinsic anodic stability (≥4.5 V vs Na+/Na) and nonflammability of phosphates.

Synergistic improvement of the overall performance of lithium-sulfur batteries 锂硫电池综合性能协同提升策略,"© 2022, Science Press. All right reserved.As one of the most promising next generation secondary battery systems, lithium-sulfur battery has the advantages of high energy density, low cost, and environmental friendliness. But its commercial application still faces several challenges, such as the intrinsic insulation of sulfur, the shuttle effect of the intermediate lithium polysulfide, and the growth of lithium dendrites. In recent years, our research group has systematically investigated the electrode materials, performance and mechanism for Li-S batteries. We have realized the solid-solid conversion of sulfur via micropore limitation, and rational cathode-electrolyte interface construction. Different from the conventional solid-liquid-solid cathode process, solid-solid conversion of sulfur can not only avoid the diffusion of the soluble intermediate lithium polysulfide and the ""shuttle effect"", but also effectively reduce the electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S) and therefore enhance the energy density of battery. In addition, we have also realized high surface capacity of the Li-S battery through structural design, and effectively inhibited the shuttle effect of polysulfide by constructing a functional intermediate layer. For lithium metal anode protection, we have designed and constructed kinds of three-dimensional current collection, which can effectively inhibit the formation of lithium dendrite, and hence comprehensively improve the safety and cyclability. We have also improved the air stability and moisture resistance of lithium metal by artificial solid electrolyte interface construction and interface modification. In addition, due to the low room-temperature conductivity and weak mechanical strength of polymer electrolytes commonly used in solid state electrolytes, we have successfully improved the mechanical property and flame resistance of polymer electrolytes by modification. Finally, we put forward a prospect for promoting the practical application of Li-S batteries with the goal of high energy, high safety and long cycle life.",Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin
Highly efficient interface stabilization for ambient-temperature quasi-solid-state sodium metal batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Solid-state sodium (Na) batteries (SSSBs) using sulfide-based solid electrolytes (SSEs) hold tremendous promise due to their high theoretical specific capacity, enhanced safety and abundant resources. However, detrimental interfacial issues between SSEs and Na metal present a major challenge to the advancement of sulfide-based SSSBs. To address interfacial issues, we demonstrate an efficient approach by incorporating an ionic liquid electrolyte ((PYR/Na)TFSI) as interlayer to stabilize the Na metal/SSE interface. The presence of the (PYR/Na)TFSI interlayer enables the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to prevent the harmful reactions and inhibit Na dendrites. Combination of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveale that this stable SEI is largely composed of reduced products of TFSI−, such as NaF and CF3. As a result, the symmetric cells exhibited stable Na plating/striping cycling for 300 h at 0.1 mA cm−2. In addition, FeS2||Na quasi-solid-state batteries delivered an impressive specific capacity of over 300 mAh g−1 under the current density of 20 mA g−1 at room temperature. Under a higher current density (100 mA g−1), such batteries performed with long-term cycling stability and maintained a specific capacity of around 103 mAh g−1 after 330 cycles. This work demonstrates the novel perspective of using an ionic liquid interlayer to address interfacial issues, contributing to the advancement of high-performance SSSBs for the next-generation energy storage systems.",Chemical Engineering Journal

However, the complexity of synthesis and safety issues caused by harmful dopant precursors must be overcome. Herein, a one-step plasma-in-liquid process is adopted to synthesize N and S co-doped carbon-based anode material (NS/C) for SBBs. NS/C exhibits a large specific surface area (476.8 m2 g−1) and abundant active sites on its surface owing to its void structure. Owing to the advantages of this structure, NS/C evidently caused a co-intercalation reaction in an ether-based electrolyte while avoiding solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer formation on the anode surface. Transmission electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method with a novel analysis method using terahertz waves are employed to prove that no SEI formed on the anode surface.

A long-standing polarized electric field in TiO2@BaTiO3/CdS nanocomposite for effective photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdFerroelectrics have the advantage of spatially separating the photogenerated charge carriers via the spontaneous polarized electric field, although the strength of the polarized electric field may suffer from the influence of the electrostatic shielding effect, which could reduce the charge carrier separation without mechanical stress. Herein, we developed a novel CdS decorated TiO2@BaTiO3 core–shell nanocomposite, where the optimal ratio of TiO2, BaTiO3 and CdS are 53.43, 37.37 and 9.20 wt%, respectively, for the best photocatalytic activity. The TiO2@BaTiO3/CdS nanocomposite reported in this work offers a persistent electric field in the ferroelectric BaTiO3 shell, due to the limited shielding effect in an asymmetrically polarized field. With the built-in electric field as the driving force, the photogenerated electrons and holes flowed into the CdS surface and the TiO2 core, respectively, with improved charge separation to participate in water-splitting reactions. The measured charge carrier lifetime of TiO2@BaTiO3/CdS nanocomposite via transient fluorescence spectrum is 0.42 ns, which is much longer than the TiO2 (0.25 ns) and TiO2@BaTiO3 (0.31 ns) samples. The TiO2@BaTiO3/CdS nanocomposite shows an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 13.22 mmol/g∙h under visible light illumination with an AQE of 52.50 % at 405 nm monochromatic light. This is much better than their components and binary composites, including TiO2/Pt (0.63 mmol/g∙h), CdS (1.23 mmol/g∙h), TiO2@BaTiO3 (0.03 mmol/g∙h), TiO2/CdS (0.53 mmol/g∙h), and BaTiO3/CdS (2.62 mmol/g∙h). This work provides an effective strategy for the construction of a ferroelectric photocatalyst with much-improved charge separation by the permanent internal electric field.",Fuel
Role of Ferroelectric In2Se3in Polysulfide Shuttling and Charging/Discharging Kinetics in Lithium/Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) and sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries, with the advantages of ultrahigh energy density, natural abundance, and ecofriendliness, are regarded as next-generation rechargeable batteries. However, polysulfide shuttling and sluggish charging/discharging kinetics in sulfur cathodes severely hamper their practical applications. In this study, via employing first-principles calculations, we investigate two-dimensional ferroelectric In2Se3as a promising additive to overcome these obstacles. Our studies reveal the following findings: (1) the In2Se3monolayer has a modest adsorption strength to soluble polysulfides, which not only eliminates the notorious shuttle effect but also prevents polysulfide dissolution; (2) In2Se3is able to significantly reduce the free energy barriers of sulfur reduction reaction and the decomposition barriers of Li2S and Na2S, thus greatly enhancing the charging and discharging efficiency; and (3) due to the strong binding ability, the polarization downward (P↓) surface always outperforms the polarization upward (P↑) surface during charging/discharging processes, enabling the effective control of battery performance by ferroelectric switching. Given these advantages, it is expected that ferroelectric In2Se3and similar ferroelectric additives will open a new route to enhance Li-S and Na-S battery performance.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Influence of Porosity of Sulfide-Based Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphases on Their Performance with Liquid and Solid Electrolytes in Li and Na Metal Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Realization of all-solid-state batteries combined with metallic Li/Na is still hindered due to the unstable interface between the alkali metal and solid electrolytes, especially for highly promising thiophosphate materials. Artificial and uniform solid-electrolyte interphases (SEIs), serving as thin ion-conducting films, have been considered as a strategy to overcome the issues of such reactive interfaces. Here, we synthesized sulfide-based artificial SEIs (LixSyand NaxSy) on Li and Na by solid/gas reaction between the alkali metal and S vapor. The synthesized films are carefully characterized with various chemical/electrochemical techniques. We show that these artificial SEIs are not beneficial from an application point of view since they either contribute to additional resistances (Li) or do not prevent reactions at the alkali metal/electrolyte interface (Na). We show that NaxSyis more porous than LixSy, supported by (i) its rough morphology observed by focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy, (ii) the rapid decrease of Rinterface(interfacial resistance) in NaxSy-covered-Na symmetric cells with liquid electrolyte upon aging under open-circuit potential, and (iii) the increase of Rinterfacein NaxSy-covered-Na solid-state symmetric cells with Na3PS4electrolyte. The porous SEI allows the penetration of liquid electrolyte or alkali metal creep through its pores, resulting in a continuous chemical reaction. Hence, porosity of SEIs in general should be carefully taken into account in the application of batteries containing both liquid electrolyte and solid electrolyte.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Multifunctional Carbon Fibers from Chemical Upcycling of Mask Waste,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Over the past years, disposable masks have been produced in unprecedented amounts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Their increased use imposes significant strain on current waste management practices including landfilling and incineration. This results in large volumes of discarded masks entering the environment as pollutants, and alternative methods of waste management are required to mitigate the negative effects of mask pollution. While current recycling methods can supplement conventional waste management, the necessary processes result in a product with downgraded material properties and a loss of value. This work introduces a simple method to upcycle mask waste into multifunctional carbon fibers through simple steps of thermal stabilization and pyrolysis. The pre-existed fibrous structure of polypropylene masks can be directly converted into carbonaceous structures with high degrees of carbon yield, that are inherently sulfur-doped, and porous in nature. The mask-derived carbon product demonstrates potential use in multiple applications such as for Joule heating, oil adsorption, and the removal of organic pollutants from aqueous environments. We believe that this process can provide a useful alternative to conventional waste management by converting mask waste generated during the COVID-19 pandemic into a product with enhanced value.",ACS Omega
Structure Engineering of BiSbSx Nanocrystals Embedded within Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Fibers for High Performance of Potassium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are regarded as promising candidates in next-generation energy storage technology; however, the electrode materials in PIBs are usually restricted by the shortcomings of large volume expansion and poor cycling stability stemming from a high resistance towards diffusion and insertion of large-sized K ions. In this study, BiSbSx nanocrystals are rationally integrated with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) fibres through electrospinning technology with an annealing process. Such a unique structure, in which BiSbSx nanocrystals are embedded inside the SPAN fibre, affords multiple binding sites and a short diffusion length for K+ to realize fast kinetics. In addition, the molecular structure of SPAN features robust chemical interactions for stationary diffluent discharge products. Thus, the electrode demonstrates a superior potassium storage performance with an excellent reversible capacity of 790 mAh g−1 (at 0.1 A g−1 after 50 cycles) and 472 mAh g−1 (at 1 A g−1 after 2000 cycles). It's one of the best performances for metal dichalcogenides anodes for PIBs to date. The unusual performance of the BiSbSx@SPAN composite is attributed to the synergistic effects of the judicious nanostructure engineering of BiSbSx nanocrystals as well as the chemical interaction and confinement of SPAN fibers.",Chemistry - A European Journal
Streamline Sulfur Redox Reactions to Achieve Efficient Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.It is vital to dynamically regulate S activity to achieve efficient and stable room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT/Na−S) batteries. Herein, we report using cobalt sulfide as an electron reservoir to enhance the activity of sulfur cathodes, and simultaneously combining with cobalt single atoms as double-end binding sites for a stable S conversion process. The rationally constructed CoS2 electron reservoir enables the straight reduction of S to short-chain sodium polysulfides (Na2S4) via a streamlined redox path through electron transfer. Meanwhile, cobalt single atoms synergistically work with the electron reservoir to reinforce the streamlined redox path, which immobilize in situ formed long-chain products and catalyze their conversion, thus realizing high S utilization and sustainable cycling stability. The as-developed sulfur cathodes exhibit a superior rate performance of 443 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 with a high cycling capacity retention of 80 % after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Designing Nanoconfined LiBH4 for Solid-State Electrolytes,"Copyright © 2022 Suwarno, Nale, Suwarta, Wijayanti and Ismail.Solid-state electrolytes are necessary for high-density and safe lithium-ion batteries. Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is one of the hydride compounds that shows promising candidates for solid-state electrolytes and enables all-solid-state batteries. LiBH4 has good wetting properties and preferable mechanical properties when used in battery cells. The Li-ion conduction in LiBH4 can be modified with nanoconfinement as a result of distinct properties on the interfaces. The ion conductivities can be modified further by choosing property support materials, i.e., composition, textural properties, and surface chemistry. The present work briefly reviews the Li-ion conduction in nanoconfined LiBH4. A future perspective on the development of LiBH4 as a solid-state electrolyte is further elaborated in the last section.",Frontiers in Chemistry
In Situ Growth of CoS2/ZnS Nanoparticles on Graphene Sheets as an Ultralong Cycling Stability Anode for Potassium Ion Storage,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Metal sulfides are promising anodes for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity and abundant active sites; however, their intrinsic low conductivity and poor cycling stability hampered their practical applications. Given this, the rational design of hybrid structures with high stability and fast charge transfer is a critical approach. Herein, CoS2/ZnS@rGO hybrid nanocomposites were demonstrated with stable cubic phases. The synergistic effect of the obtained bimetallic sulfide nanoparticles and highly conductive 2D rGO nanosheets facilitated excellent long-term cyclability for potassium ion storage. Such hybrid nanocomposites delivered remarkable ultrastable cycling performances in PIBs of 159, 106, and 80 mA h g-1at 1, 1.5, and 2 A g-1after 1800, 2100, and 3000 cycles, respectively. Moreover, the full-cell configuration with a perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride organic cathode (CoS2/ZnS@rGO∥PTCDA) exhibited a better electrochemical performance. Besides, when the CoS2/ZnS@rGO nanocomposites were applied as an anode for sodium-ion batteries, the electrode demonstrated a reversible charge capacity of 259 mA h g-1after 600 cycles at 2 A g-1. In situ X-ray diffraction and ex situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy characterizations further confirmed the conversion reactions of CoS2/ZnS during insertion/desertion processes. Our synthesis strategy is also a general route to other bimetallic sulfide hybrid nanocomposites. This strategy opens up a new roadmap for exploring hybrid nanocomposites with feasible phase engineering for achieving excellent electrochemical performances in energy storage applications.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Trends in the Development of Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.This review examines research reported in the past decade in the field of the fabrication of batteries based on the sodium–sulfur system, capable of operating at an ambient temperature (room-temperature sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries). Such batteries differ from currently widespread lithium-ion or lithium–sulfur analogs in that their starting materials are cheaper and more readily available. One of the key problems to be resolved on the way to room-temperature Na–S batteries with high energy density and long-term cycling stability is transport of cell reaction products (sodium polysulfides) to the opposite electrode, which leads to an appreciable battery self-discharge and loss of the active material as a result of redox reactions that are not accompanied by energy generation. This review is aimed at examining approaches to improving the electrochemical performance of the room-temperature Na–S batteries. Particular attention is paid to potential applications of cation-exchange materials capable of suppressing polysulfide anion transport, with a high sodium cation transport rate retained.",Inorganic Materials

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Real-time structural changes in Na-β”-alumina were observed in situ using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with electron beam irradiation. Na-β”-alumina has been widely investigated as a solid electrolyte material for sodium–sulfur secondary batteries owing to its high ionic conductivity. This high conductivity is known to be due to the Na+ ions on the loosely packed conduction planes of Na-β”-alumina. In the present study, we acquired real-time videos of the generation of spinel blocks caused by the conduction of Na+ ions. In addition, by observing Na extraction during electron beam irradiation, we experimentally confirmed that spinel block generation originates from the Na+ ion conduction, which has been a subject of recent debate.",Materials
Engineering Sodium Metal Anode with Sodiophilic Bismuthide Penetration for Dendrite-Free and High-Rate Sodium-Ion Battery,"© 2022 THE AUTHORSSodium (Na) metal batteries with a high volumetric energy density that can be operated at high rates are highly desirable. However, an uneven Na-ion migration in bulk Na anodes leads to localized deposition/dissolution of sodium during high-rate plating/stripping behaviors, followed by severe dendrite growth and loose stacking. Herein, we engineer the Na hybrid anode with sodiophilic Na3Bi-penetration to develop the abundant phase-boundary ionic transport channels. Compared to intrinsic Na, the reduced adsorption energy and ion-diffusion barrier on Na3Bi ensure even Na+ nucleation and rapid Na+ migration within the hybrid electrode, leading to uniform deposition and dissolution at high current densities. Furthermore, the bismuthide enables compact Na deposition within the sodiophilic framework during cycling, thus favoring a high volumetric capacity. Consequently, the obtained anode was endowed with a high current density (up to 5 mA∙cm−2), high areal capacity (up to 5 mA∙h∙cm−2), and long-term cycling stability (up to 2800 h at 2 mA∙cm−2).",Engineering

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This study aims to design a new nanocomposite as a supporting material for wiring the enzyme to develop a bioanode in the enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC). In this work, polyaniline-based nanocomposite was synthesized by in situ polymerization of aniline monomer. The zeta potential study of the nanofillers was carried out, which reveals the interaction between the nanofillers. The synthesized nanocomposite (MWCNT/ZnS/AgNWs/PANI) was characterized by analytical techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD). Furthermore, the surface morphology and the in-depth information of the synthesized nanocomposite were displayed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. In addition, the as-synthesized nanocomposite and the designed bioanode underwent the electrochemical assessment using different electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) for evaluating the electrochemical behavior of the fabricated anodes. The electrochemically regulated bioanode (MWCNT/ZnS/AgNWs/PANI/Frt/GOx) obtained an open-circuit voltage of 0.55 V and produced a maximal current density of 7.6 mA cm−2 at a glucose concentration of 50 mM prepared in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (pH 7.0) as a supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.",Polymers
High electrochemical activity of Li2S2 linking two-dimensional tungsten boride nanosheet enables high-loading and long-lasting lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe Li2S-based cathodes with a high theoretical capacity of 1,166 mAh/g are regarded as the commercially available lithium-sulfur battery that can be coupled with Li-free anodes to avoid the safety concern of lithium metal. However, the instinct Li2S passivation leads to a high activation potential and low sulfur utilization with the notorious polysulfide migration. Herein, the single-atom tailoring strategy in designing liquid Li2S2 catholyte is created without the use of any complicated manufacturing processes or additives, where the Li2S2 cell enables the 3.0 V activation voltage without potential barrier. Meanwhile, the conductive and polar tungsten boride offer the active center to anchor polysulfides migration. As expected, the tungsten boride-Li2S2 cathode exhibits excellent cycling stability, impressive cycling performance without initial potential barrier.",Materials Today Energy
Nitrogen-doped hollow carbon boosting the anchoring of sulfur capacity for high-loading lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.As one of the best candidates, lithium sulfur battery (Li–S) is extensively explored due to the high theoretical capacity and abundant sources of sulfur. Carbon-based materials take an important role as a host for sulfur in the cathode. In this paper, a nitrogen-doped hollow carbon for sulfur cathode (NHC–S) with high sulfur loading of 92% is studied for Li–S batteries. The structural characterization demonstrates that the N-doping can improve the graphitization of the hollow carbon material, which increases the electrical conductivity. The catalytic and deposition nucleation tests indicate that the N doping can increase the nucleation rate of Li2S, which is also illustrated by the larger binding energies of Li2S on N-doping substrates than on carbon via density functional theory (DFT) analysis. The initial specific capacity of NHC–S is 864.8 mAh g−1 at the current density of 0.2 C, and 460.8 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles. When the sulfur content loading was up to 2.8 mg cm−2, the electrode material could achieve 85% capacity retention after 100 reversible cycles.",Microporous and Mesoporous Materials

ChemNanoMat published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Li−S battery has been considered as the next-generation energy storage device, which still suffers from the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). In this work, mesoporous hollow carbon-coated MnO nanospheres (C@MnO) have been designed and synthesized using spherical polyelectrolyte brushes (SPB) as template, KMnO4 as MnO precursor, and polydopamine as carbon source to improve the electrochemical performance of Li−S battery. The hollow C@MnO nanospheres enable the combination of physical confinement and chemical adsorption of the LiPSs.

Sodium-ion nanoionic hybrid solid electrolyte: Extended study on enhanced electrical and electrochemical properties,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A hybrid solid electrolyte (HSE) was successfully synthesised by infusing a novel ceramic halloysite-based Na2ZnSiO4 (Clay-NZS) with ionic liquid solution of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Py14TFSI IL) and sodium trifluoromethanesulfonimide (NaTFSI salt) to form Clay-NZS:IL:xSalt, where x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. Microscopic images and porosity study show that the infused ionic liquid solution fill up the pores of Clay-NZS ceramic host at a maximum of 20 wt% of the sample pellet. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray show that Na+ from NaTFSI displaces Py14+ in Py14TFSI as the salt concentration increases, accounting for slower ionic transport in the HSE. Impedance spectroscopy shows the highest conductivity to be in Clay-NZS:IL:0.1Salt HSE with σ = (1.1 ± 0.2) × 10−3 S cm−1 at 300 °C indicate there is a dynamic interaction between Clay-NZS ceramic host and the ionic liquid solution in an HSE setup. Its Na-ion transference number is t+ = 0.506, indicating that Na+ is the majority charge carrier in the HSE. Linear sweep voltammetry shows electrochemical stability window of up to 4.32 V at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry showcases reversible redox reactions in the HSE. Notwithstanding, the HSE carries the potential to be an electrolyte in a rechargeable sodium-ion battery.",Solid State Ionics
Introducing the Solvent Co-Intercalation Mechanism for Hard Carbon with Ultrafast Sodium Storage,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.As the most successful anode material for sodium-ion batteries, hard carbon has attracted extensive attention from researchers. However, its storage mechanism is still controversial. In this paper, a solvent co-intercalation mechanism into hard carbon is proposed and is proved by in situ XRD and ex situ TEM XPS results successfully. Thanks to the co-intercalation of solvent, the platform capacity of hard carbon maintains well at very high current densities. It can even exhibit 245 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1, which is the best rate performance obtained for hard carbon anode as far as it is known. The full battery assembled with Na3V2(PO4)3 has a high energy density of 157 Wh kg−1 at 3800 W kg−1 (relative to the electrode). This finding brings new insights with regard to the design of hard carbon materials and sodium storage mechanisms.",Small
A High-Efficiency Mo2C Electrocatalyst Promoting the Polysulfide Redox Kinetics for Na–S Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries, as promising next-generation energy storage candidates, are drawing more and more attention due to the high energy density and abundant elements reserved in the earth. However, the native downsides of RT Na-S batteries (i.e., enormous volume changes, the polysulfide shuttle, and the insulation and low reactivity of S) impede their further application. To conquer these challenges, hierarchical porous hollow carbon polyhedrons embedded with uniform Mo2C nanoparticles are designed deliberately as the host for S. The micro- and mesoporous hollow carbon indeed dramatically enhances the reactivity of the S cathodes and accommodates the volume changes. Meanwhile, the highly conductive dispersed Mo2C has a strong chemical adsorption to polysulfides and catalyzes the transformation of polysulfides, which can effectively inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides and accelerate the reaction kinetics. Thus, the as-prepared S cathode can display a high reversible capacity (1098 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 120 cycles) and superior rate performance (483 mAh g−1 at 10.0 A g−1). This work provides a new method to boost the performance of RT Na–S batteries.",Advanced Materials
Synergetic Anion Vacancies and Dense Heterointerfaces into Bimetal Chalcogenide Nanosheet Arrays for Boosting Electrocatalysis Sulfur Conversion,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Vacancy and interface engineering are regarded as effective strategies to modulate the electronic structure and enhance the activity of metal chalcogenides. However, the practical application of metal chalcogenides in lithium−sulfur (Li−S) batteries is limited by their low conductivity, rapid decline in catalytic activity, and large volume variation during the discharging/charging process. Herein, bimetal sulfide (CoZn-S) nanosheet arrays with sulfur vacancies and dense heterointerfaces are proposed to accelerate sulfur conversion and improve the performance of Li−S batteries. Systematic investigations reveal that sulfur-vacancy and build-in interfacial field in CoZn-S facilitate the electron transfer and regulate the electronic structure. The well-designed 3D nanosheet array structures shorten the ion-transport pathway and inhibit the volume fluctuation of CoZn-S during the electrocatalysis process. Density functional theory studies confirm that the built-in interfacial field and sulfur vacancy can promote the thermodynamic formation and decomposition of Li2S, thus improving their intrinsic activity.",Advanced Materials
Investigating MCM-41/metal-organic framework nanocomposites as silicon-containing electrodes for supercapacitor,"© 2022For both batteries and supercapacitors, developing electrodes based on Silicon is of enormous interest. The purpose of this study was to prepare two nanocomposites, MZ8 (MCM-41/ZIF-8) and MU66 (MCM-41/UiO-66), that have been specifically designed to function as electrode materials. The cyclic voltammograms showed enlarged potential window and galvanostatic charge-discharge by confirming the samples' successful synthesis process and morphological structure via XRD, FT-IR, TGA, BET, TEM, and FESEM plots gave excellent specific capacitance. MU66 with spherical morphology and average particle size around 50 nm creates more appropriate pores, and more accessible pathways showed higher capacitance (992 F g − 1 @ 0.5 Ag−1), while MZ8 (351 F g − 1 @ 0.5 Ag−1) with hexagonal morphology and average particle size around 350 nm stands more durable (100%) after 4000 cycles. MZ8 displayed an EDLC with semi-rectangular CV and symmetric charge-discharge graphs, while MU66 showed inflation at lower sweep rates and lowered current densities, representing a hybrid charge mechanism. Based on the EIS test, MZ8 showed lower charge resistance and was more conducive to taking the barriers of the low capacitance of Si-based electrodes. We believe that the fabrication of Si-containing materials into MOFs can protect Si from swelling-shrinking and maintain close contact between Si and electrolyte to use both merits of MOF structures and Si capacity.",Surfaces and Interfaces
Tungsten Nanoparticles Accelerate Polysulfides Conversion: A Viable Route toward Stable Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries are arousing great interest in recent years. Their practical applications, however, are hindered by several intrinsic problems, such as the sluggish kinetic, shuttle effect, and the incomplete conversion of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs). Here a sulfur host material that is based on tungsten nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene is reported. The incorporation of tungsten nanoparticles significantly accelerates the polysulfides conversion (especially the reduction of Na2S4 to Na2S, which contributes to 75% of the full capacity) and completely suppresses the shuttle effect, en route to a fully reversible reaction of NaPSs. With a host weight ratio of only 9.1% (about 3–6 times lower than that in recent reports), the cathode shows unprecedented electrochemical performances even at high sulfur mass loadings. The experimental findings, which are corroborated by the first-principles calculations, highlight the so far unexplored role of tungsten nanoparticles in sulfur hosts, thus pointing to a viable route toward stable Na–S batteries at room temperatures.",Advanced Science
Sodiated Nafion membranes for sodium metal aprotic batteries,"© 2022The expansion of the use of renewable energy sources replies on the availability soon of cheap, safe and suitable energy storage systems. In this respect batteries can be a pivotal solution. Among the available battery chemistries, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently the state-of-the-art coupling excellent performance, minimal self-discharge, and technological readiness. However, costs and sustainability together with safety are hindering the booming of LIBs. Aprotic sodium ion and sodium metal batteries are similar technological options with more balanced figures in terms of performance/sustainability compared to LIBs. Focusing on safety, for both LIBs and NIBs hazards are originated by liquid electrolytes that are flammable, volatile and contain fluorinated salts. Thus, technological improvements on the electrolyte side are the key also for the commercial exploitation of NIBs. Here we propose and demonstrate for the first time in the literature the use of a sodiated Nafion membrane as a single-ion conductor electrolyte for sodium-ion batteries.",Electrochimica Acta
Highly uniform lithiated nafion thin coating on separator as an artificial SEI layer of lithium metal anode toward suppressed dendrite growth,"© 2022A lithiated Nafion (Li+-Nafion) thin coating on lithium (Li) metal anode has been evidenced to be capable of inhibiting Li dendrite growth. However, shortcomings of Li metal such as poor stability in air and high reactivity with water bring inconvenience in the coating preparation. To address this issue, a highly uniform Li+-Nafion thin layer coated commercial polypropylene (PP) separator is fabricated via an ultrasonic spray method. In cells, the Li+-Nafion thin coating faces and contacts with Li metal anode to act as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer of the anode. The addition of N,N-Dimethylformamide in sprayed aqueous Li+-Nafion solution is crucial for the highly uniform deposition of Li+-Nafion thin coating with a thickness of 0.8 μm due to the improved wettability of the sprayed Li+-Niafion solution with the PP separator. The uniform Li+-Nafion thin coating significantly increases the Li+ transference number (tLi+) of the PP separator from 0.34 to 0.76. The improved tLi+ and the high uniformity of the Li+-Nafion thin coating enable the coated PP separator to suppress Li dendrite growth, and consequently to promote the cycle performance of lithium-sulfur cells. This work proposes an implantation approach for artificial SEI layers employed in Li metal batteries.",Electrochimica Acta

Holdups in Nitride MXene's Development and Limitations in Advancing the Field of MXene,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.As nanomaterials are becoming a key component in various electronics, 2D nanomaterials are emerging and attracting tremendous attention in the scientific community due to their unique physical, chemical, and structural properties. In recent years, a new family of 2D carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, has become the center of attention for many electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems. While nitride MXenes have some publications centered around them, the overwhelming majority revolve around carbide and their direct application to systems without understanding the underlying mechanism behind their performance. The lack of publications in both of these fields, nitrides and mechanistic understanding, causes a major stopgap in MXene research and needs to be remedied in order to truly utilize their potential for future electronics and energy conversion systems. In this work, the limited works on nitride MXenes and the applications of in situ/operando characterization techniques in understanding the underlying mechanisms of energy storage and conversion in MXenes are reviewed, major progress and remaining challenges in both fields are identified, recommendations on how to circumvent the challenges and limitations are provided, and finally, new research directions that must be performed to advance the field of 2D carbide and nitride MXenes are proposed.",Small
Sodium-rich NASICON-structured cathodes for boosting the energy density and lifespan of sodium-free-anode sodium metal batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. InfoMat published by UESTC and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Rechargeable sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have emerged as promising alternatives to commercial Li-ion batteries because of the natural abundance and low cost of sodium resources. However, the overuse of metallic sodium in conventional SMBs limits their energy densities and leads to severe safety concerns. Herein, we propose a sodium-free-anode SMB (SFA-SMB) configuration consisting of a sodium-rich Na superionic conductor-structured cathode and a bare Al/C current collector to address the above challenges. Sodiated Na3V2(PO4)3 in the form of Na5V2(PO4)3 was investigated as a cathode to provide a stable and controllable sodium source in the SFA-SMB. It provides not only remarkable Coulombic efficiencies of Na plating/stripping cycles but also a highly reversible three-electron redox reaction within 1.0–3.8 V versus Na/Na+ confirmed by structural/electrochemical measurements. Consequently, an ultrahigh energy density of 400 Wh kg−1 was achieved for the SFA-SMB with fast Na storage kinetics and impressive capacity retention of 93% after 130 cycles. A narrowed voltage window (3.0–3.8 V vs. Na/Na+) further increased the lifespan to over 300 cycles with a high retained specific energy of 320 Wh kg−1. Therefore, the proposed SFA-SMB configuration opens a new avenue for fabricating next-generation batteries with high energy densities and long lifetimes. (Figure presented.).",InfoMat
Recent advances in the modeling of fundamental processes in liquid metal batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLiquid Metal Batteries (LMBs) have a potential to emerge as a cost-effective solution for grid-scale energy storage to overcome the intermittency of renewable energy generation and to facilitate the management of peak loading requirements. They have significant advantages over other battery types such as high-power density and cyclability, use of earth-abundant materials, self-healing capability, high coulombic efficiency, and ease of scalability. The successful adoption of LMBs for grid storage requires a thorough understanding of the underlying processes that govern the performance of LMBs to prevent any detrimental effects at higher storage capacities. However, most of the research work in this relatively new field has focused on developing new electrode materials to achieve higher performance and lower operating temperature. In this review, we focus on other critical aspects such as heat and mass transfer, electric potential, instabilities, high temperature sealing and state of charge, which are vital to the functioning of LMBs. The models that have been developed to study these processes and attributes of LMBs, and their learning advancements have been summarized. Moreover, the challenges and outlook of research on modeling of LMBs are presented which are expected to significantly contribute to the development of a comprehensive model combining these effects that will offer insights into optimization of design and operating conditions of LMBs resulting in accelerated scaling and commercialization.",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
A polymer organosulfur redox mediator for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Commercial application of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) largely depends on precise regulation of complex sulfur redox reactions. Herein, polymer organosulfur compounds (POCs) are designed as promising redox mediators for the first time. The mesoporous yolk-shell POCs with covalently linked short-chain sulfur are coated on commercial PP separators to regulate the redox behavior of sulfur. The short-chain sulfur could spontaneously interact with polysulfides to reversibly regulate the electrochemical conversions of polysulfides, afford faster sulfur redox kinetics and improve the deposition of Li2S. POCs could also interact with lithium ions to stabilize the lithium-metal anode. Hence, the POC endows the commercial sulfur cathode with an outstanding rate performance of 790 mA h g−1 at 4.0 C and a higher capacity retention up to 87% within 1000 cycles at 2.0 C. The LSB with a high-sulfur-loading of 6.8 mg cm−2 and a small electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5.6 uL mg[S]−1 is also synthesized, achieving an excellent capacity of 5.9 mA h cm−2 after cycling.",Energy Storage Materials
Enhanced redox kinetics based on Mo2C-C/Fe3C electrocatalyst for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Due to high energy density and theoretical capacity, lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for next-generation secondary batteries.

A hybrid dual-salt polymer electrolyte for sodium metal batteries with stable room temperature cycling performance,"© 2022Sodium metal batteries (NMBs) are among the most promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries. However, the thermal instability, potential leakage, and dendrite growth typical of NMBs with organic liquid electrolytes still pose severe limitations to this technology. These challenges can be overcome by replacing the organic liquid electrolytes with solids or gels. In this study, a hybrid dual-salt polymer electrolyte (DSPE), comprising sodium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) and sodium difluoro(oxalate)borate (NaDFOB) salts is reported. The two salts work synergistically: NaTFSI enhances ionic conductivity and thermal stability, while NaDFOB extends the electrochemical window and inhibits the corrosion of the Al current collectors caused by NaTFSI. Furthermore, the DSPE with a NaDFOB/NaTFSI optimized molar ratio of 20% delivers a high ionic conductivity of 0.31 mS cm−1 at 23 °C. At this temperature, the NMB with a Na3V2(PO4)3@carbon positive electrode has excellent cycling performance (104.0 mAh g − 1 at 1 C with 92.4% capacity retention over 300 cycles) and rate capability (93.5 mAh g − 1 at 5 C). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) characterizations, together with ab initio calculations reveal that stable battery performance is linked to the formation of a NaxBOyFz-containing protective cathode-electrolyte interphase layer. Leveraging the synergistic combination of two salts, this new DSPE formulation opens a new path for next-generation, high-performance NMBs.",Energy Storage Materials
NiS2 nanosheet arrays on stainless steel foil as binder-free anode for high-power sodium-ion batteries,"© 2022, Youke Publishing Co.,Ltd.Owing to the wide range and low cost of sodium resources, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received extensive attention and research. Metal sulfides with high theoretical capacity are used as promising anode materials for SIBs. This paper presents the electrochemical performance of the binder-free NiS2 nanosheet arrays grown on stainless steel (SS) substrate (NiS2/SS) using an in situ growth and sulfidation strategy as anode for sodium ion batteries. Owing to the close connection between the NiS2 nanosheet arrays and the SS current collector, the NiS2/SS anode demonstrates high rate capability with a reversible capacity of 492.5 mAh·g−1 at 5.0C rate. Such rate capability is superior to that of NiS2 nanoparticles (NiS2/CMC: 41.7 mAh·g−1 at 5.0C, NiS2/PVDF: 7.3 mAh·g−1 at 5.0C) and other Ni sulfides (100–450 mAh·g−1 at 5.0C) reported. Furthermore, the initial reversible specific capacity and Coulombic efficiency of NiS2/SS are 786.5 mAh·g−1 and 81%, respectively, demonstrating a better sodium storage ability than those of most NiS2 anodes reported for SIBs. In addition, the amorphization and conversion mechanism during the sodiation/desodiation process of NiS2 are proposed after investigation by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of intermediate products at successive charge/discharge stages.

How to better share energy towards a carbon-neutral city? A review on application strategies of battery energy storage system in city,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdDespite the recent market growth and price reduction of technologies for a battery energy storage system (BESS), many technological, operational, and managerial challenges still need to be overcome to improve the system's feasibility and commercialization. Many studies suggested various solutions for applying BESS to the grid system, yet the existing literature is dispersed across different scopes, scales, and levels. Previous studies also lack a comprehensive overview of different application strategies of BESS within the urban landscape. Therefore, this study aimed to broaden our perspective and implement the concept of “BESS-based energy sharing” for carbon-neutrality at the urban level. Towards this end, this study investigated the key factors and main technologies for BESS application in the city through a comprehensive literature review. These results indicated that the limitations of current application technologies of the BESS and energy sharing using BESS should be overcome in the carbon-neutral city. As a result, this study proposed future direction of the BESS application strategies towards smart energy sharing in cities, as follows: (i) bi-directional interactions across hierarchical levels of the city; (ii) integrated management for high connectivity of distributed generation; and (iii) development of a BESS-based energy management system. This study would allow scholars, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to better understand the energy sharing mechanism within the city and provide systematic guidelines and pathways towards smart energy sharing with the advanced energy infrastructure using BESS from a bi-directional perspective across different hierarchical levels of the city.",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
Heterointerface synergistic Na+ storage fundamental mechanism for CoSeO3 playing as anode for sodium ion batteries/capacitors,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The transition metal selenite CoSeO3 single crystal nanoparticles with primary particle size distribution ranging from 80 to 200 nm is systematically investigated as anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs)/capacitors (SICs). It achieves stable Na+ storage capacity of 280 mAh g−1 at a high current density of 10 A g−1 in CoSeO3||Na SIBs. Furthermore, the corresponding CoSeO3||Activated carbon (AC) SICs also presents a high energy density of 51 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 2 kW kg−1, along with 72% energy retention after 3000 cycles at 1 A g−1. Combining advanced microscopy (HRTEM, SEM), density functional theory (DFT) calculations and surface science (XPS), it is demonstrated that the CoSeO3 in-situ transform into binary oxides CoO/SeO2 and form heterointerfaces during the initial discharge/charge cycle. The coupled heterointerfaces between CoO and SeO2 could construct strong internal electric field, accelerating the electron/Na+ diffusion kinetics during the subsequent charge–discharge process and boosting Na+ pseudocapacitance storage. The finding of heterointerfaces synergistic sodium-ion storage fundamental mechanism of transition metal selenite might provide inspiration for the development of new anode material for sodium-based storage devices.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Regulating Na deposition by constructing a Au sodiophilic interphase on CNT modified carbon cloth for flexible sodium metal anode,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Na metal anode has attracted increasing attentions as the anode of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity, low redox potential and high abundance. However, the formation of uncontrollable Na dendrite during repeated plating/stripping cycles hinders its further development and application. Herein, a sodiophilic Na metal anode host is developed by sputtering gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) into interconnected carbon nanotube modified carbon cloth (CNT/CC) to form a Au-CNT/CC architecture. Sodiophilic Au NPs effectively guide the Na metal uniform deposition and three-dimensional (3D) microporous structure offers a large surface area for nucleation and reducing the current densities. The regulated uniform Na metal deposition mechanism is investigated by the in-situ optical microscopy and simulation analysis. As a result, Au-CNT/CC electrode exhibits a low nucleation overpotential (2.2 mV) and stable cycle performance for 1600 h at 1 mA cm−2 with 2 mAh cm−2. Moreover, it even exhibits a long cycle stability for more than 800 h at 5 mA cm−2 with 2 mAh cm−2. To explore its application, a full cell coupled with a sodium vanadium phosphate coated with carbon layer (NVP@C) cathode is assembled and delivers an average discharge capacity of 80.6 mAh g−1 and coulombic efficiency of 99.6% for 400 cycles at 100 mAh g−1. Furthermore, a flexible pouch cell with Na@Au-CNT/CC as the anode is fabricated and demonstrated good flexibility and future application of wearable electronics.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Engineering Pocket-Like Graphene–Shell Encapsulated FeS2: Inhibiting Polysulfides Shuttle Effect in Potassium-Ion Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Resource-rich FeS2 is a promising anode for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). However, polysulfides emerge due to FeS2 conversion during discharging, which dissolve into the ether-based electrolyte and cause the continuous capacity degradation in PIBs. To address the polysulfides dissolution in PIBs, a graphene–shell-encapsulated FeS2 is fabricated and embedded in N/S codoped 3D hollow carbon spheres. As a protective pocket, the graphene–shell can effectively accommodate polysulfides inside the core–shell, inhibiting the polysulfides shuttle effect to enhance cycle stability of electrode. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that graphene–shells have a strong adsorption capacity for polysulfides, and the interfacial interaction between KFeS2 and graphene–shell can boost the K ion mobility. As a result, the composite exhibits superior-rate properties (524 and 224 mA h g−1 at 0.1 and 8 A g−1, respectively) and long-term cycle stability. This work demonstrates the promotion and protective effect of the graphene–shell for the FeS2 to storage K from both experimental and computational perspectives. These research outputs can provide guidance for designing other metal-based sulfide electrodes for PIBs.",Advanced Functional Materials

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted scientific interest as electrode materials for LIBs, while the utilization of pristine MOFs is hindered by limited conductivity and stability, partly due to their lack of hierarchically structured pores. Herein a hydrothermal-mechanical synthesis is reported by combining the one-pot chemical fabrication of Ni3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)2 sheets and particles, and the mechanical assembly of these building blocks to improve electrical conductivity is also described. The as-prepared ensemble (denoted as NHM) exhibits a Tostadas-shaped structure with enriched ultramicropores and micropores. The charge-discharge profile of NHM gives a superior reversible capacity of 1280 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at the rate of 0.1 A g−1, surpassing the state-of-art pristine MOFs-based anodes. Moreover, NHM is capable of maintaining 392 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles, the completion of a stability test in coin cell-powered light emitting diodes further visualizes the remitted capacity fading of NHM. This work breaks through the limitation of capacity for pristine MOFs, providing a new pathway for achieving better energy conversion and storage.",Advanced Functional Materials

Herein, a novel multi-phase interface structure of embedded CoP and Co2P nanoparticles (CoxP NPs) on hollow N-doped carbon substance (CoxP/NC) was successfully fabricated by the in-situ conversion of ZIF-67@ZIF-8 dual templates. The abundant multi-phase interfaces on CoxP/NC enabled efficient lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) capture, accelerated Li-ion diffusion, and boosted LiPSs conversion, thus forming a rapid and robust “adsorption-diffusion-conversion” network. Moreover, the well-defined hollow carbon polyhedrons physically inhibit the LiPSs diffusion and provide superior conductivity. As a result, the assembled S@CoxP/NC cathode with a high sulfur loading of 82% delivers an excellent rate capability (617.7 mAh g−1 at 3C), impressive stability (a small capacity decay of 0.053% per cycle over 1250 cycles at 1C), and favorable durability of thick sulfur cathodes (with a high areal sulfur loading of 4.68 mg cm2 over 300 cycles).",Chemical Engineering Journal

Isolated Co single atoms in nitrogen-doped graphene for aluminum-sulfur batteries with enhanced kinetic response,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesAl-S batteries are promising next generation energy storage devices due to their high theoretical energy density (1340 Wh kg−1), low cost, and safe operation. However, the electrochemical performance of Al-S batteries suffers poor reversibility owing to slow kinetic processes determined by the difficulty of reversible conversion between Al and S. Here, we proposed a single-atom catalysts comprising Co atoms embedded in a nitrogen-doped graphene (CoNG) as an electrochemical catalyst in the sulfur cathode that renders a reduced discharge-charge voltage hysteresis and improved sulfur utilization in the cathode. The structural and electrochemical analyses suggest that the CoNG facilitated both the formation and oxidation of AlSx during the electrochemical reactions of the sulfur species. Consequently, the CoNG-S composite can deliver a considerably reduced voltage hysteresis of 0.76 V and a reversible specific capacity of 1631 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 with a sulfur utilization of more than 97%.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

Strategies for Harnessing High Rate and Cycle Performance from Graphite Electrodes in Potassium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have been lauded as the next-generation energy storage systems on account of their high voltage capabilities and low costs and the high abundance of potassium resources. However, the practical utility of PIBs has been heavily encumbered by severe K metal dendrite formation, safety issues, and insufficient electrochemical performance during operations─indeed critical issues that underpin the need for functional electrolytes with high thermal stability, robust solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI)-forming capabilities, and high electrochemical performance. In a bid to establish a knowledge framework for harnessing high rate capabilities and long cycle life from graphite negative electrodes, this study presents the physical properties and electrochemical behavior of a high K+ concentration inorganic ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte, K[FSA]-Cs[FSA] (FSA- = bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide) (54:46 in mol), at an intermediate temperature of 70 °C. This IL electrolyte demonstrates an ionic conductivity of 2.54 mS cm-1 and a wide electrochemical window of 5.82 V. Charge-discharge tests performed on a graphite negative electrode manifest a high discharge capacity of 278 mAh g-1 (0.5 C) at 70 °C, a high rate capability (106 mAh g-1 at 100 C), and a long cyclability (98.7% after 450 cycles). Stable interfacial properties observed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy during cycling are attributed to the formation of sulfide-rich all-inorganic SEI, which was examined through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The performance of the IL is collated with that of an N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium-based organic IL to provide insight into the synergism between the highly concentrated K+ electrolyte at intermediate temperatures and the all-inorganic SEI during electrochemical operations of the graphite negative electrode.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Boosting the transport kinetics of free-standing SnS2@Carbon nanofibers by electronic structure modulation for advanced lithium storage,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryTin-based materials with high capacity and long life are significant to the development of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, free-standing Mg doped SnS2/CNF (Mg-SnS2/CNFs) composites are prepared via electrospinning and subsequent carbonization and sulfidation. Mg-doping promotes the Li-ion diffusion kinetics of SnS2 by decreasing the activation energy and improving the pseudocapacitance contribution. The inhibition of pulverization ensures high reversibility and good cycling stability of the Mg-SnS2/CNF anode. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Mg doping effectively induces the redistribution of electrons to generate internal electrical fields, accelerating the transport kinetics of Li ions and electrons at interlayers. The excellent ion transport kinetics endows Mg-SnS2/CNF electrodes with an excellent rate capacity (354.7 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1 and 207.1 mA h g−1 at 30 A g−1) and an outstanding cyclability (792.5 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 for 1000 cycles) in LIBs.

Growing Mechanism of Polysulfides and Elemental Sulfur Formation: Implications to Hindered Chalcopyrite Dissolution,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Metal-deficient polysulfides have been argued for a long time to be responsible for the low kinetics of chalcopyrite leaching to extract copper. It has been shown that chalcopyrite surfaces are the source of sulfur that is oxidized to form polysulfides and elemental sulfur. Electronic structure calculations were performed for HxSnx-2 (x = 0, 1, 2 and n = 1...20), aiming to understand the effect of the pH on the growing chains and the formation of elemental sulfur. The estimated pKa1 of the H2Sn polysulfides converges from 4.2 (n = 3) to 3.4 (n ≥ 8), and the estimated pKa2 converges from 7.6 (n = 3) to 4.1 (n ≥ 8). The initial steps of the formation of polysulfide chains are more favored for protonated species. The elemental sulfur formation due to the decomposition of polysulfides to form smaller chains is mostly favored for protonated species with n smaller than 12. For larger chains, the decomposition is thermodynamically favored for polysulfides with any degree of protonation. The consequences of these results to the understanding of the mechanism of the chalcopyrite leaching process are discussed with the focus on the pH effect and the formation of elemental sulfur.",Journal of Physical Chemistry A
Fe Nanoparticle Size Control of the Fe-MOF-Derived Catalyst Using a Solvothermal Method: Effect on FTS Activity and Olefin Production,"© 2022 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.The design of a highly active Fe-supported catalyst with the optimum particle and pore size, dispersion, loading, and stability is essential for obtaining the desired product selectivity. This study employed a solvothermal method to prepare two Fe-MIL-88B metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived catalysts using triethylamine (TEA) or NaOH as deprotonation catalysts. The catalysts were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, N2-physisorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, H2 temperature-programed reduction, and thermogravimetric analysis and were evaluated for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis performance. It was evident that the catalyst preparation in the presence of TEA produces a higher MOF yield and smaller crystal size than those produced using NaOH. The pyrolysis of MOFs yielded catalysts with different Fe particle sizes of 6 and 35 nm for the preparation in the presence of TEA and NaOH, respectively. Also, both types of catalysts exhibited a high Fe loading (50%) and good stability after 100 h reaction time. The smaller particle size TEA catalyst showed higher activity and higher olefin yield, with 94% CO conversion and a higher olefin yield of 24% at a lower reaction temperature of 280 °C and 20 bar at H2/CO = 1. Moreover, the smaller particle size TEA catalyst exhibited higher Fe time yield and CH4 selectivity but with lower chain growth probability (α) and C5+ selectivity.",ACS Omega

An exquisite yolk-shell structured bimetallic sulfide NiCo2S4 synthesized via a two-step solvothermal hydrothermal method is investigated as a cathode material for rechargeable Mg batteries. With the bimetallic strategy and well-designed architecture, the as-synthesized yolk-shell NiCo2S4 exhibits outstanding Mg-storage performance, demonstrating a superior reversible capacity (270 mA h g−1 at 50 mA h g−1), a high rate capability, and a specific capacity retention of 91% over 400 cycles (2.2% capacity decay per cycle). The in-depth mechanism investigation reveals the two-step conversion reaction process and the bimetallic synergistic effect in the Mg-storage process. Based on DFT calculations and kinetic investigations, the bimetallic synergistic effect effectively alleviates the Jahn-Teller effect and distortion in the crystal lattices and increases active reaction sites, thus largely enhancing the electrochemical Mg-storage performance. The superior electrochemical performance of NiCo2S4 not only demonstrates the viability of the bimetallic strategy but also sheds light on the use of nanostructure design for high-performance cathode research.",Nanoscale
One-pot synthesis of SnS2 Nanosheets supported on g-C3N4 as high capacity and stable cycling anode for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Despite being established as the most popular commercial energy storage system (ESS), lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are still facing practical issues due to their high cost and limited availability of the lithium source. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), which have economic and environmental costs, but on-par performance compared to LIBs, are now being considered as the next-generation ESS. Herein, we report a facile and mass-scalable synthesis of SnS2 nanosheets grafting on porous g-C3N4 via direct solid-state reaction from tin (IV) acetate and thiourea as precursors. The synthesized SnS2@g-C3N4 composites served as an anode active material for SIBs with outstanding performances in terms of high capacity and ultralong cycling stability. The optimum anode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1350.7 mAh g−1 and the first coulombic efficiency of 55.13%. However, this composite can offer a remarkable charge capacity of 919.6 and 602.7 mAh g−1 after 400 and 3000 cycles at specific currents of 500 and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. The enhancement in the cyclability of the obtained composites is attributed to the presence of g-C3N4 as a scaffolding material effectively relieving serious strains induced by the volume variation of SnS2 during sodium storage. The high exfoliation of SnS2 nanosheets with larger interlayer spacing as well as the presence of a self-induced internal electric field formed at the heterointerface of SnS2 and g-C3N4 enables the enhanced transport of electrons and sodium ions, accompanied by the improvement in their electrochemical performance.",International Journal of Energy Research

To improve the efficiency of multicarbon products in Cu-based catalysts, optimizing the *CO adsorption and reducing the energy barrier for carbon-carbon (C-C) coupling are essential features. In this work, a strong local electric field is obtained by regulating the arrangement of Cu nanoneedle arrays (CuNNAs). CO2 reduction performance tests indicate that an ordered nanoneedle array reaches a 59% Faraday efficiency for multicarbon products (FEC2) at −1.2 V (vs RHE), compared to a FEC2 of 20% for a disordered nanoneedle array (CuNNs). As such, the very high and local electric fields achieved by an ordered Cu nanoneedle array leads to the accumulation of K+ ions, which benefit both *CO adsorption and C-C coupling. Our results contribute to the design of highly efficient catalysts for multicarbon products.",Nano Letters

Alternately Intercalated Superstructure of MoS2and C Monolayers for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Energy Storage and Efficient Removal of Cr(VI),"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Two-dimensional layered materials with a rational design have displayed great promise for applications of energy storage and removal of Cr(VI) from an aqueous environment. Herein, we report an ultrathin-layered MoS2-based hybrid with an interlayer-expanded structure by inserting a N-doped carbon layer into adjacent MoS2monolayers. The superstructure not only shortens the Na+diffusion pathway and provides abundant channels for Na+diffusion but also elevates the electrical conductivity of the material significantly. When applied as a negative electrode in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the as-prepared MoS2/carbon hybrid delivers an outstanding cycle performance of 338.31 mAh g-1at 1000 mA g-1after 3000 cycles. In addition, due to the abundant pore structure and adsorption sites, the composite delivers an excellent adsorption performance of 128.80 mg g-1for Cr(VI). This study may inspire developments of SIBs and adsorbent materials.",Energy and Fuels
Tessellated N-doped carbon/CoSe2 as trap-catalyst sulfur hosts for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe construction of highly conductive structures with excellent adsorption-catalytic properties to accelerate electron transfer and suppress polysulfide shuttle is considered as an effective strategy to achieve well-performing sodium-sulfur batteries. Herein, a self-supported tessellated N-doped carbon/CoSe2 (NCCS) is developed as a sulfur host for sodium-sulfur batteries by a simple deposition-selenization of lyophilized bacterial cellulose (BC), where NC acts as a conductive network to ensure the rapid initiation of efficient catalytic reactions at the tessellated CoSe2 interface and maintain good structural stability. The CoSe2 nanoparticles provide strong ability in anchoring, trapping and catalyzing polysulfides. As a result, the prepared tessellated NCCS@S cathode demonstrates a high initial discharge specific capacity of 871.3 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 0.1C and good electrochemical stability for up to 500 cycles at 1C.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers
Elucidating Synergistic Mechanisms of Adsorption and Electrocatalysis of Polysulfides on Double-Transition Metal MXenes for Na-S Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Multiple unfavorable features, such as poor electronic conductivity of sulfur cathodes, the dissolution and shuttling of sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn) in electrolytes, and the slower kinetics for the decomposition of solid Na2S, make sodium-sulfur batteries (NaSBs) impractical. To overcome these obstacles, novel double-transition metal (DTM) MXenes, Mo2TiC2T2, (T = O and S) are studied as an anchoring material (AM) to immobilize higher-order polysulfides and to expedite the otherwise slower kinetics of insoluble short-chain polysulfides. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are carried out to justify and compare the effectiveness of Mo2TiC2S2and Mo2TiC2O2as AMs by analyzing their interactions with S8/Na2Sn(n = 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8). Mo2TiC2S2provides moderate adsorption strength compared to Mo2TiC2O2, therefore, it is expected to effectively inhibit Na2Sndissolution and shuttling without causing decomposition of Na2Sn. The calculated Gibbs free energies of the rate-determining step for sulfur reduction reactions (SRR) are found to be significantly lower (0.791 eV for S and 0.628 eV for O functionalization) than that in vacuum (1.442 eV), suggesting that the SRR is more thermodynamically favorable on Mo2TiC2T2during discharge. Additionally, both Mo2TiC2S2and Mo2TiC2O2demonstrated effective electrocatalytic activity for the decomposition of Na2S, with a substantial reduction in the energy barrier to 1.59 eV for Mo2TiC2S2and 1.67 eV for Mo2TiC2O2. While Mo2TiC2O2had superior binding properties, structural distortion is observed in Na2Sn, which may adversely affect cyclability. On the other hand, because of its moderate binding energy, enhanced electronic conductivity, and significantly faster oxidative decomposition kinetics of polysulfides, Mo2TiC2S2can be considered as an effective AM for suppressing the shuttle effect and improving the performance of NaSBs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Supramolecular Thixotropic Ionogel Electrolyte for Sodium Batteries,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Owing to the potential of sodium as an alternative to lithium as charge carrier, increasing attention has been focused on the development of high-performance electrolytes for Na batteries in recent years. In this regard, gel-type electrolytes, which combine the outstanding ionic conductivity of liquid electrolytes and the safety of solid electrolytes, demonstrate immense application prospects. However, most gel electrolytes not only need a number of specific techniques for molding, but also typically suffer from breakage, leading to a short service life and severe safety issues. In this study, a supramolecular thixotropic ionogel electrolyte is proposed to address these problems. This thixotropic electrolyte is formed by the supramolecular self-assembly of D-gluconic acetal-based gelator (B8) in an ionic liquid solution of a Na salt, which exhibits moldability, a high ionic conductivity, and a rapid self-healing property. The ionogel electrolyte is chemically stable to Na and exhibits a good Na+ transference number. In addition, the self-assembly mechanism of B8 and thixotropic mechanism of ionogel are investigated. The safe, low-cost and multifunctional ionogel electrolyte developed herein supports the development of future high-performance Na batteries.",Gels

Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.Selenium-sulfur(SexSy) composites can be used as energy storage materials for lithium batteries benefit from their integration of the high capacity of sulfur and the high conductivity of selenium. Herein, we prepared amorphous three dimensional reduced graphene oxide/selenium sulfide(a-3DG/Se4.7S3.3) composites and crystalline 3DG/Se4.7S3.3(c-3DG/Se4.7S3.3) composites by in situ synthesis and hydrothermal methods, respectively, in order to research the effect of different morphologies of 3DG/Se4.7S3.3 composites on the electrochemical properties of all-solid-state lithium batteries. Our study found that the a-3DG/Se4.7S3.3 cathodes displayed greater capacity and outstanding rate performance, with an initial discharge capacity of 926 mAh g-1 and utilization rate of 103% at 1/2C. And a first discharge capacity of up to 706 mAh g-1 at 7 C. Although the first discharge capacity of c-3DG/Se4.7S3.3 was 523 mAh g-1, its cycling stability was significantly improved compared with that of a-3DG/Se4.7S3.3 cathodes, and the Coulombic efficiency remained above 97% after 60 cycles at ½ C.

"Size-controlled, hollow and hierarchically porous Co2Ni2alloy nanocubes for efficient oxygen reduction in microbial fuel cells","© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Uniform, hollow-structure and hierarchically porous materials often exhibit surprisingly outstanding electrocatalytic performance. However, fabrication of highly active and stable non-noble metal-based alloys remains a huge challenge. Herein, a facile synthetic strategy that allows two-step fabrication of size-controllable Co2Ni2 hierarchical alloy nanocubes (HANCs) with a uniform composition and hollow structure is proposed. The as-fabricated Co2Ni2 HANCs exhibit an ultrahigh surface area and a hierarchical porous structure owing to co-reduction deposition of metal particles. The uniform hollow structure is produced by etching with the assistance of weak organic acids to further expand the inner space of the nanocubes. The size of the Co2Ni2 HANCs can be precisely controlled by regulating the added content of the structure-directing modulator urea with positive correlation. The Co2Ni2 HANCs possess a four-pointed star-like interior cavity and a marginal oxide layer with a thickness of 7 nm. Experimental and theoretical studies straightforwardly show that the hierarchically porous hollow Co-Ni alloy can reduce the energy barrier, accelerate the ORR kinetics, and greatly promote the improvement of electrocatalytic activity.",Reaction Chemistry and Engineering
Preparation and Electrocatalytic Activity of a Cobalt Mixed Nitrogen 3D Carbon Nanostructure @ Carbon Felt toward an All-Vanadium Redox Flow Battery,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.All-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), with good operation flexibility and scalability, have been regarded as one of the most competitive substitutes for large-scale energy storage. However, because of the low electrochemical activities of traditional electrodes such as carbon felt and graphite felt, they will impede the interfacial charge transfer processes and decrease the efficiencies of VRFBs. In this work, Co-MOF (ZIF-67) was prepared as a precursor, and a cobalt mixed nitrogen 3D carbon nanostructure and carbon felt (Co-CN@CF) was prepared by chemical reaction and used in VRFBs as electrodes. With the unique structure and high efficiency catalyst on the carbon felt, the Co-CN@CF exhibited excellent electrochemical activity toward the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple in the VRFB, with an average cell voltage efficiency (VE) of 86% and an energy efficiency (EE) of 82% at 80 mA cm−2, which was increased by more than 10% compared with the traditional carbon felt. VRFBs with a Co-CN@CF electrode also showed much better long-term stability (over 1000 cycles) compared with the battery with a pristine CF electrode.",Applied Sciences (Switzerland)
Synthesis of granulated Li/Al-LDHs adsorbent and application for recovery of Li from synthetic and real salt lake brines,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Powder Li/Al-layered double hydroxides (LDHs) of Li2Al4(CO3)(OH)12·3H2O were hydrothermally synthesized in one pot with sodium alginate as a structure modifier and granulated by crosslinked sodium alginate. The powder and granulated Li/Al-LDHs lithium adsorbents were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, and porosity. The adsorption-desorption performance of the granulated Li/Al-LDHs adsorbents was evaluated. Adsorption isotherm, adsorption kinetics, adsorption thermodynamics were investigated. The effects of solution pH, temperature, and the electrolytes (NaCl, Na2SO4, MgCl2, and KCl) on lithium adsorption, and the dissolution of granulated Li/Al-LDHs adsorbents after cyclic adsorption-desorption were also investigated. The granulated Li/Al-LDHs adsorbed 14.5 mg/g of lithium from the brine of East Taigener Salt Lake with a lithium concentration of 1400 mg/L. The granulation of powder Li/Al-LDHs by crosslinked alginate greatly reduced the dissolution of powder Li/Al-LDHs.

A family of MOFs@Wood-Derived hierarchical porous composites as freestanding thick electrodes of solid supercapacitors with enhanced areal capacitances and energy densities,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdA general strategy is developed to synthesize a family of metal-organic frameworks decorated on wood (MOFs@Wood, MOFs = ZIF-8, ZIF-67, MOF-74, or MOF-199) composite materials. The carbonized/activated MOFs@Wood derived hierarchical porous composites (C-MOFs@ACW) can be directly used as freestanding thick electrodes of solid symmetric supercapacitors (SSSCs) with enhanced areal capacitances and energy densities. This can be attributed to the combination of the three-dimensional (3D) porous network structure of natural wood and the microporous/mesoporous property of MOFs nanocrystals. Notably, the C-ZIF-8@ACW electrode displays high areal specific capacitances of 12.52 and 8.95 F/cm2 at the current densities of 1 and 20 mA/cm2, respectively. Moreover, a SSSC assembled by two identical C-ZIF-8@ACW electrodes delivers a superior energy density of 0.55 mWh/cm2 at a power density of 0.5 W/cm2, while maintaining 96.8% of initial capacitance over 10,000 cycles.",Materials Today Energy
Hierarchical conformal coating enables highly stable microparticle Si anodes for advanced Li-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMicrosized silicon powders have great potential for high capacity anode materials in next-generation lithium ion batteries, because of the high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities, ease of mass production and low costs. However, large volume change and consequently rapid capacity fading upon lithiation and delithiation prevent its practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate an effective hierarchical conformal coating strategy for high-performance microsized Si anodes. The Si-based composites consist of an amorphous Li-Si-O inner coating layer and a graphene outer encapsulation layer, which are prepared by coupling reactive milling with electrostatic self-assembly. This unique hierarchical conformal coating structure not only strengthens the mechanical property (31.8 GPa for the elastic modulus) and promotes the ionic diffusion (2.03 × 10−10 cm2 s−1) of Si anode, but also effectively stabilizes the electrode/electrolyte interfaces and increases the electronic conductivity. As a result, a high reversible capacity (1450 mA⋅h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), good cycling stability (97.7% of capacity retention from the 2nd to the 310th cycle at 0.5 A g−1), and high rate capability (703 mA⋅h g−1 at 5 A g−1) have been successfully achieved. These findings provide new insights into the improvement of electrochemical properties of microsized Si composite anodes for high-performance Li-ion batteries.",Applied Materials Today
CO2 reduction reaction pathways on single-atom Co sites: Impacts of local coordination environment,"© 2022 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of SciencesSingle-atom catalysts have been proposed as promising electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). Co-N4 active sites have attracted wide attention owing to their excellent CO selectivity and activity. However, the effect of the local coordination environment of Co sites on CO2 reduction reaction pathways is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the CO2 reduction reaction pathways on Co-N4 sites supported on conjugated N4-macrocyclic ligands with 1,10-phenanthroline subunits (Co-N4-CPY) by density functional theory calculations. The local coordination environment of single-atom Co sites with N substituted by O (Co-N3O-CPY) and C (Co-N3C-CPY) was studied for comparison. The calculation results revealed that both C and O coordination break the symmetry of the primary CoN4 ligand field and induce charge redistribution of the Co atom. For Co-N4-CPY, CO was confirmed to be the main product of CO2RR. HCOOH is the primary product of Co-N3O-CPY because of the greatly increased energy barrier of CO2 to *COOH. Although the energy barrier of CO2 to *COOH is reduced on Co-N3C-CPY, the desorption process of *CO becomes more difficult. CH3OH (or CH4) are obtained by further *CO hydrogenation reduction when using Co-N3C-CPY. This work provides new insight into the effect of the local coordination environment of single-atom sites on CO2 reduction reaction pathways.",Chinese Journal of Catalysis
Long Cycle Life and High-Rate Sodium Metal Batteries Enabled by Regulating 3D Frameworks with Artificial Solid-State Interphases,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe major challenge for sodium metal anodes is Na dendrite growth owing to the unstable and fragile solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI), leading to terrible cycle life and safety hazards. Constructing a robust SEI around a 3D porous host is considered to be a facile and efficient approach to stabilize Na metal anodes. Here, a durable 3D porous SnCl4@Na–rGO metal anode is fabricated by the in situ chemical reaction of SnCl4-containing carbonate electrolyte with Na–rGO. Attributed to the robust SEI and the stereoscopic structure, the symmetric cells achieve a prolonged cycle life of 500 h without voltage fluctuation at 2 mA cm−2 and 2 mAh cm−2.

One-step in-situ synthesis of Sn-nanoconfined Ti3C2Tx MXene composites for Li-ion battery anode,"© 2022Benefiting from the unique chemical properties and the adjustable layered spacing, MXenes have been paid more attention to the field of energy storage and conversation, especially towards constructing hybrid structure for the use of Li-ion battery anodes. However, most MXene-based composites are achieved by the ex-situ mixing method on the basis of acid-etched MXene, which makes it extremely hard to maintain a good structural stability in the service process. Herein, we proposed a novel one-step in-situ strategy, i.e. SnCl2 molten salt reaction with Ti3AlC2 for synthesizing Sn-nanoconfined Ti3C2Tx MXene composites. During the synthesis process, SnCl2 not only executed as the Lewis acid to etch Ti3AlC2 for obtaining Ti3C2Tx MXene, but could also be in-situ transformed to Sn nanoparticles confined between the Ti3C2Tx MXene layers. The 2D layer-confined effect inhibited the spontaneous coarsening of metal Sn at high temperature as well as the huge volume expansion during the electrochemical cycles. Meanwhile, the in-situ formed Sn nanoparticles as pillar played a decisive role in enlarging interlayered active spacing of Ti3C2Tx MXene for Li-storage. As a result, the surprising enhancement of electrochemical Li-storage performances could be achieved during long-term cycling. This work provides a novel route to explore the application of MXene based on the molten salt methods.",Electrochimica Acta

Herein, a palladium-magnetic iron/poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid)/nitrogen and sulfur co-doped titanium carbide (Pd-Fe3O4/PEDOT:PSS/NS-Ti3C2Tx) composite frameworks was fabricated, hoping to provide an interesting strategy for the design of PM sensor. First, the NS-Ti3C2Tx was synthesized through N and S co-doped modification of Ti3C2Tx to improve its electrical properties. The hierarchical PEDOT:PSS/NS-Ti3C2Tx composite, as catalytic supports of Pd-Fe3O4, was constructed with PEDOT:PSS inserting between the NS-Ti3C2Tx nanolayers to enhance the dispersibility and continuity of the layers. The components and structure of composites were well identified by various characterization and analysis methods. More importantly, the Pd-Fe3O4/PEDOT:PSS/NS-Ti3C2Tx/GCE sensing platform indicates an outstanding electrocatalytic activity in the electro-reduction of PM with sensitivity of 517.08 μA mM−1 cm−2, linear detection range of 0.01–140 μM, limit of detection as 3.3 nM, and ks as 3.585 s−1.

FTIR investigations demonstrate significant changes in characteristic bands, while XRD observations indicate prominent structural variation in terms of merger/suppression of phases when NaClO4, Mg(ClO4)2 and LiClO4 salts are immobilized in the PVdF-HFP/TEGDME matrix. The highest room temperature ionic conductivity of 1.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 with high dielectric constant value has been obtained for the Li+ conducting electrolyte composition due to its superior electrochemistry and ion-conduction behavior as compared to its Na+ and Mg2+ counterparts. In the low-frequency region, modulus curves reveal polarizing effects with long-range mobility/migration of Na/Mg/Li ions, while in the high-frequency region, a peak onset relating the translational ion dynamics and conductivity relaxation is observed. The reported polymer gel electrolytes may be employed as electronic materials for developing next-generation flexible electrochemical devices.",Journal of Electronic Materials

However, to obtain all-solid-state sodium secondary batteries with high-energy density, it is necessary to develop a high-capacity positive electrode material. In this study, two types of amorphous (a-)MoSx (x ≃ 6) active electrode materials were prepared using a mechanochemical (MC) process and through the thermal decomposition (TD) of (NH4)2Mo2S12·2H2O. Herein, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted, and the results revealed significantly different local structures of a-MoSx (MC) and a-MoSx (TD).

Ultrastable sodium metal plating/striping by engineering heterogeneous nucleation on TiO2 nanotube arrays,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Sodium metal is considered as an excellent anode material for sodium-based energy storage devices with both high energy density and low cost, but the uncontrollable growth of sodium metal seriously limits its application. Herein, we firstly propose 3D spaced TiO2 nanotube arrays (STNTs) uniformly coated with ultra-fine metal (Ag, Cu) nanocrystals as a substrate with absorption-diffusion regulation strategy to control the sodium metal deposition behavior. TiO2 has a higher sodiophilic activity with larger Na absorption energy than the traditional copper substrate. Moreover, it is found by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations that it is much easier for Na to spread upon the surface of silver compared to copper, and thus forming a mixed Na-Ag layer at the interface. As a result, sodium metal is inclined to deposit inside or along the nanotube in STNTs-Ag in nanoscale. Finally, STNTs-Ag||Na half-cell displays a high Coulombic efficiency ∼99.5% even after 500 cycles with 1 mAh cm−2. Symmetric cell of STNTs-Ag-Na exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 4 mV and a long-term cycling life over 1400 h. Moreover, STNTs-Ag-Na anode coupling with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibits a significantly reduced polarization voltage with 22 mV and improved rate performance with 110 mAhg−1 at 10 C.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"V2O3-decorated carbon nanofibers as a robust interlayer for long-lived, high-performance, room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.We developed a V2O3 nanoparticle–decorated carbon nanofiber (V2O3@CNF) interlayer for room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries (RT/NaSBs), inserted on the cathode side of the separator to inhibit the shuttling of sodium polysulfides, i.e., their migration to the sodium anode, and thus realize high-performance RT/NaSBs. The V2O3 adsorbs polysulfides and catalytically promotes polysulfide trapping, while the CNFs provide conductive channels that facilitate ion transport and accelerate reaction kinetics. The electrochemical performance of the resulting Na–S cells are superior to those of cells with a CNF interlayer and without an interlayer. A cell with a V2O3@CNF interlayer utilizes almost 70% of its active material at 0.1C, while cells with a CNF interlayer and without an interlayer utilize 54 and 33%, respectively. It demonstrates superior rate performance, achieving a capacity of 268 mA h g−1 at 2.0C, and its diffusion coefficient (∼10−11cm2 s−1) is an order of magnitude higher than those of cells with a CNF interlayer or without an interlayer (∼10−12 cm2 s−1), indicating fast reaction kinetics. Moreover, it delivers a discharge capacity of 406 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1.0C with a high coulombic efficiency of 100%. Even at a high C-rate of 2.0C, the capacity of the cell decays at a low rate of 0.076% per cycle over 1000 cycles, indicating exceptional capacity retention. The outstanding electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the effective sodium polysulfide confinement, improved active material utilization, and accelerated reaction kinetics associated with the V2O3@CNF interlayer.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Interfacial-engineering-enabled practical low-temperature sodium metal battery,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.Solid-state sodium (Na) batteries have received extensive attention as a promising alternative to room-temperature liquid electrolyte Na-ion batteries and high-temperature liquid electrode Na–S batteries because of safety concerns. However, the major issues for solid-state Na batteries are a high interfacial resistance between solid electrolytes and electrodes, and Na dendrite growth. Here we report that a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-enhanced beta-alumina solid electrolyte (YSZ@BASE) has an extremely low interface impedance of 3.6 Ω cm2 with the Na metal anode at 80 °C, and also exhibits an extremely high critical current density of ~7.0 mA cm–2 compared with those of other Li- and Na-ion solid electrolytes reported so far. With a trace amount of eutectic NaFSI–KFSI molten salt at the electrolyte/cathode interface, a quasi-solid-state Na/YSZ@BASE/NaNi0.45Cu0.05Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 full cell achieves a high capacity of 110 mAh g–1 with a Coulombic efficiency >99.99% and retains 73% of the cell capacity over 500 cycles at 4C and 80 °C. Extensive characterizations and theoretical calculations prove that the stable β-NaAlO2-rich solid–electrolyte interphase and strong YSZ support matrix play a critical role in suppressing the Na dendrite as they maintain robust interfacial contacts, lower electronic conduction and prevent the continual reduction of BASE through oxygen-ion compensation.",Nature Nanotechnology

However, the solid electrolytes have a low ionic conductivity and poor interface properties, so it is difficult for them to reach the level of conventional liquid electrolyte systems. We have now built an adjustable porous 3D network structure by contacting PVDF-HFP and SnO2, and optimized the ion conductive path in the gel polymer electrolyte by adding 1-(4-cyanophenyl)-guanidine. PVDF-HFP with a 3D network structure provides a channel for storing and transporting sodium ions, and the imino nitrogen atom of 1-(4-cyanophenyl)guanidine can form a ligand with sodium ions to enhance the conduction of Na+. The gel polymer electrolyte (PSGGSE) thus obtained has an ion conductivity of 0.232 mS cm−1 at 70 °C, and is easy to form a stable interface layer with the anode. Further experiments showed that compared with liquid electrolytes, a more stable interface was formed between PSGGSE and the anode. Cycling tests of Na/PSGGSE/Na symmetric batteries under different current densities showed that no short circuit occurred after 400 h, indicating that the battery could not be short-circuited, and PSGGSE can effectively inhibit the growth of Na dendrites. In addition, the Na/PSGGSE/NiMoO4 battery has an excellent cycling stability at the current density of 100 mA g−1, and still maintains a high capacity of 150 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles, which is much higher than that of liquid electrolytes.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Thiophene-incorporated CTFs with boosted intramolecular charge transfer and defect-abundant networks for potent photosensitized oxidation of organics,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Simultaneously modulating the adsorption and electronic properties of pure conjugated polymers for efficient photosensitized oxidation of organics is environmentally desirable but still challenging. Of interest to us in this work was to construct artificial defective donor-sensitizer-acceptor covalent triazine framework (CTF) and probe how the transformation of barely active pure polymers into high-efficiency photosensitizer occurred. The thiophene/cyano (–Th/–CN) donor–acceptor (D–A) configurations in the structural terminations were facilely formed by incorporating thiophene units into CTF (denoted as CTF-xTh), which simultaneously induced plenty of defect sites spread over the polymer networks. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the incorporated D–A dyads could serve as charge delivery channels for intramolecular charge transfer transition and render the photogenerated charges spatially delocalized at the –Th/–CN terminated edge sites, which impels the proceeding of photoactivation reaction with oxyanions (represented by HSO5−). Moreover, the edge defects could serve as high-energy adsorption sites for enriching organics (represented by bisphenol-A (BPA)), which enables the generated reactive species to be in close proximity to contaminants to have greater chances of attacking these molecules. With these merits, a 4-fold enhancement of HSO5− conversion and a 10-fold improvement of BPA adsorption were found in Vis/ HSO5−/CTF-5Th system as compared with corresponding pristine CTF system, and thus the overall BPA removal increased by 8 times. This work demonstrated the first instance of using D-A tailored CTF for photosensitized oxidation of organics and provided new opportunities toward designing of novel polymers for visible-light-driven photocatalysis.",Chemical Engineering Journal

"An interface-free integrative graphitic carbon network film with defective and S/O-Codoped hollow units for voltage-stable, Ultra-fast and long-life potassium ion storage","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In the K-storage process, graphitic carbon exhibits unique practical plateau potential but suffers terrible rate and cycle performance, because its perfect long-range ordered carbon structure, small lattice space and high contact/interface resistance are still bottlenecks to limit the kinetics and structural stability. Herein, we prepare a novel interface-free integrative graphitic carbon network film on a large scale, and enlarged its lattice distance and reasonably introduce defects (ED-IGCN) to boost kinetics and cyclability via a plasma-enhanced etching/S-doping process. Typically, the ED-IGCN entails ultra-thin hollow graphitic units (diameter ∼ 10 nm, shell wall ∼ 1 nm) interconnected by sp2 hybrid covalent bonds, providing an interface-free highly conductive network. Additionally, the defective long-range ordered carbon arrangement and enlarged lattice distance ensured numerous open channels and shortened pathways with low diffusion barrier for boosting the fast (de)potassiation kinetics. When applied in PIB, the ED-IGCN anodes delivered a high reversible capacity of 408 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1, and ultra-high rate and long-term cyclability without expensing its unique discharge plateau. The capacity maintained up to 91.1 mA h g−1 after 10,000 cycles at 5 A g−1 with a capacity retention of ∼ 60% (∼51% after 11,000 cycles), which is not inferior to that of any graphitic carbon reported previously. We separated the diffusive capacity, and pseudo-/double-layer capacitive contributions, and verified that the plasma treating process enhanced the capacitive K-storage mechanism which give great contribution to the fast kinetics. A full-cell based on potassium Prussian blue (KPB) cathode and ED-IGCN anode delivered an initial reversible capacity of 177 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1, and retained ∼ 70% after 50 cycles, further demonstrating the ultra-high rate capability of ED-IGCN in practical application. The results provide new insights into the design and structure regulations of graphitic carbon for fast-charging batteries with stable working voltages and an understanding of the diffusion acceleration mechanism in graphitic carbon materials.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Architecture design principles for stable electrodeposition behavior-towards better alkali metal (Li/Na/K) anodes,"© 2021Alkali (Li/Na/K) metal anodes (AMAs), because of their remarkably high energy density and low redox potential, are considered as the most promising anodes for next-generation high-energy battery systems. Nevertheless, high reactivity and uncontrollable volume change of metal anodes during plating/striping inevitably generate dendritic metal and unstable solid electrolyte interphase, inducing low Coulombic efficiency, inferior cycling stability and even safety issues. Architecture design is emerged as an effective approach to address these fatal issues and plenty of attempts have been conducted so far. Instead of simply summarizing the structure-designing strategies to modify AMAs, the review is dedicated to overviewing and categorizing the strategies of architecture design towards the challenges of AMAs by their fundamental design principles from the perspective of electrochemical reaction. Besides, the similarities and differences of three types of alkali metals, in terms of mechanical and chemical properties, have been systematically discussed. Finally, we overviewed the existing challenges, perspectives on further development direction, and outlook for practical applications for AMAs.",Energy Storage Materials
Ligand Engineering in Nickel Phthalocyanine to Boost the Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbHDesigning and synthesizing efficient molecular catalysts may unlock the great challenge of controlling the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with molecular precision. Nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) appears as a promising candidate for this task due to its adjustable Ni active-site. However, the pristine NiPc suffers from poor activity and stability for CO2RR owing to the poor CO2 adsorption and activation at the bare Ni site. Here, a ligand-tuned strategy is developed to enhance the catalytic performance and unveil the ligand effect of NiPc on CO2RR. Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that NiPc with electron-donating substituents (hydroxyl or amino) can induce electronic localization at the Ni site which greatly enhances the CO2 adsorption and activation. Employing the optimal catalyst—an amino-substituted NiPc—to convert CO2 into CO in a flow cell can achieve an ultrahigh activity and selectivity of 99.8% at current densities up to −400 mA cm−2. This work offers a novel strategy to regulate the electronic structure of active sites by ligand design and discloses the ligand-directed catalysis of the tailored NiPc for highly efficient CO2RR.",Advanced Functional Materials
An overview of the key challenges and strategies for lithium metal anodes,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdAnode materials play a significant role in the batteries system. Li metal has emerged as the promising anode material owing to their vital well-known merits, such as high theoretical specific capacity (about 3860 mAh g−1), the most negative potential (-3.040 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode).

An elemental sulfur/CoS2- ionic liquid based anode for high-performance aqueous sodium-ion batteries,"© 2021Despite having advantages of safety and dominating consumer and electric vehicle market, the progress of aqueous rechargeable battery research is hindered by low capacity anode materials. A game-changing strategy is to use an environmentally benign aqueous electrolyte with earth abundance Na-ion and sulfur. Sulfur promises to be a next-generation electrode material due to its high theoretical capacity and energy density. But the practical application of elemental sulfur in aqueous electrolyte suffer from sharp capacity decay due to the dissolution of polysulfides. Herein, we report 70 % elemental sulfur along with CoS2 and 1‑butyl‑3-methylimidazolium o,o-bis(2-ethylhexyl) dithiophosphate (BMIm-DDTP) ionic liquid (IL) as anode (S@CoS2-IL) for aqueous rechargeable sodium-ion/sulfur batteries (ARSSB) in 2 M aq. Na2SO4 electrolyte.The S@CoS2-IL anode delivers an outstanding capacity of 977 mA h g−1 (> 91 % of the theoretical capacity of elemental sulfur i.e. 1070 mA h g−1), at 0.5 C with a stable cycling performance over 100 cycles with > 98 % of capacity retention at 2 C with 100 % of coulombic efficiency. A negligible loss of S was confirmed by UV–Vis spectroscopy and potentiometric titration and anchoring of polysulfide at S@CoS2-IL anode were evidenced by NMR, ESI-mass, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The synergy between highly active CoS2 and BMIm-DDTP IL from the dynamic coordination of dithiophosphate with CoS2 provides easy access for polysulfides anchoring and fast reaction kinetics which effectively suppresses the dissolution of discharge polysulfides and HS−. The full cell studies using S@CoS2-IL anode with standard Na0.44MnO2 cathode demonstrate an outstanding capacity of 778 mA h g−1 w.r.t the weight of S and 104.98 mA h g−1 (of total electrodes weight), which is close to the theoretical capacity of 109 mA h g−1 with 100 % coulombic efficiency and 91.8 % capacity retention over 400 cycles at 2 C. The excellent performance of this aqueous battery chemistry shows that S@CoS2-IL anode has great potential towards practical application in ARSSB.",Energy Storage Materials

Single-Atom Catalysts: Advances and Challenges in Metal-Support Interactions for Enhanced Electrocatalysis,"© 2021, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University.Single-atom catalysts (SACs), which contain a single metal atom supported on a well-confined substrate, are among the most promising heterogeneous catalysts owing to their unique advantages, such as high intrinsic activity and selectivity, tunable bonds and coordination, abundant metal-containing active sites, and atomic economy. Since metal-support interactions (MSIs) in SACs exert a substantial influence on the catalytic properties, gaining a profound understanding and recognition of catalytic reactions depends greatly on investigating MSIs both experimentally and computationally. Hence, the engineering and modulation of MSIs are regarded as one of the most efficient methods to rationally design SACs with disruptively enhanced catalytic properties. In this review, we track the recent advances in SACs from an MSI perspective. We then discuss the existing MSIs in SACs and elucidate the significant role of strong MSIs in catalytic properties and mechanisms. The challenges hindering the rational design of supported SACs with strong MSIs, which are currently still far from being completely understood and overcome, are described. In addition, the correlation between strong MSIs and electrocatalytic activities in SACs, including an outlook to increase our understanding of MSIs, is discussed. Finally, the present review provides some perspectives and an in-depth understanding of strong MSIs to advance high-performing SACs.

A model cathode for mechanistic study of organosulfide electrochemistry in Li-organosulfide batteries,"© 2021 Science PressOrganosulfides offer new opportunities for high performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries because of materials abundance, versatile structures and unique properties. Yet, their redox kinetics as well as cycling performance need to be further improved. Employing redox mediators is a highly effective strategy to address above challenges. However, the underlying mechanism in this chemistry is so far insufficiently explored. Here, phenyl disulfide (PhS–SPh) and phenyl diselenide (PhSe–SePh) are used as a model system for mechanistic understanding of organosulfide electrochemistry, particularly the rate acceleration. Profiling the reaction thermodynamics and charge-discharge process reveals redox of both S–S and C–S bonds, as well as that the coupling between radical exchange and electrochemical redox is the key to enhance the sulfur kinetics. This study not only establishes a basic understanding of orgaonsulfide electrochemistry in Li-S batteries, but also points out a general strategy for enhancing the kinetics of sulfur electrodes in electrochemical devices.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

Metallic phase W0.9Mo0.1S2 for high-performance anode of sodium ion batteries through suppressing the dissolution of polysulfides,"© 2021 Science PressWS2 with layered graphite-like structure as anode for sodium ion batteries has high specific capacity. However, the poor cycling performance and rate capability of WS2 caused by the low electronic conductivity and structure changes during cycles inhibit its practical application. Herein, metallic phase (1T) WxMo1−xS2 (x = 1, 0.9, 0.8 and 0.6) with high electronic conductivity and expanded interlayer spacing of 0.95 nm was directly prepared via a simple hydrothermal method. Specially, 1T W0.9Mo0.1S2 as anode for sodium ion batteries displays high capacities of 411 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 180 cycles and 262 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 280 cycles and excellent rate capability (245 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1). The full cell based on Na3V2(PO4)2O2F/C cathode and 1T W0.9Mo0.1S2 anode also exhibits high capacity and good cycling performance. The irreversible electrochemical reaction of 1T W0.9Mo0.1S2 with Na ions during first few cycles results in the main products of W-Mo alloy and S. The strong adsorption of W-Mo alloy with polysulfides can effectively suppress the dissolution and shuttle effect of polysulfides, which ensures the excellent cycling performance of 1T W0.9Mo0.1S2.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Stabilizing sodium metal anode through facile construction of organic-metal interface,"© 2021Implementation of sodium metal anode is highly desired for sodium batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. Unfortunately, formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and uncontrollable growth of dendrites during charge/discharge cycles greatly hinder the practical application of sodium metal anode. In this study, an organic-metal artificial layer made of PVdF and Bi was constructed to protect Cu current collector via a facile coating method, leading to smooth and dense sodium plating/stripping, which in retern enables stable cycling and high coulombic efficiency (CE). At 1 mA cm−2, PB@Cu current collector presents extended lifetime of ~2500 h with high sodium utilization of 50%, which is approximately six times higher than Cu current collector. PB@Cu electrode also displays high average CE of 99.92% and 99.95% over 2500 and 1300 cycles at 1 and 2 mA cm−2 respectively, which is in sharp contrast to the low and tremendously fluctuant CE gained from bare Cu electrode. Moreover, stable capacity of > 90 mAh g−1 over 150 cycles is realized for PB@Cu-based full cell assembled with NVP cathode at a low negative-positive capacity ratio of ~3.5, which is significantly higher than 37.2 mAh g−1 obtained from NVP/Cu at 150th cycle. The superior electrochemical performance of PB@Cu current collector is revealed to originate from the alloyed Na3Bi phase with high sodium conductivity and robust mechanical strength as well as the formation of NaF-rich SEI with fast sodium ion migration, which enable dendrite-free morphology during plating/stripping cycles.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

On the anode side, metallic sodium, with an ultra-high theoretical capacity and a low redox potential, has been considered the most promising material for batteries with a high energy density. However, the use of a sodium metal anode has met some challenging problems, such as the growth of sodium dendrites, side reactions between sodium metal and the electrolyte, and large volume changes during charge and discharge.

Evaluating the effectiveness of in situ characterization techniques in overcoming mechanistic limitations in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Advanced energy storage systems require high energy and power densities, abundant availability of raw materials, low cost, reasonable safety, and environmental benignancy. Owing to their exceptionally high theoretical gravimetric energy density (2600 W h kg−1) and specific capacity (1675 mA h g−1), lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs) are considered a promising candidate for next-generation energy storage systems. However, low sulfur loading, rapid capacity depletion, poor coulombic efficiency, and unstable cyclability have so far prevented their commercialization. These issues mainly originate from the lack of knowledge about the mechanisms taking place during the redox reactions involved in the complex conversion chemistry that LSBs rely on. In situ characterization techniques have long been sought to help answer questions regarding these mechanisms. Herein, we review the major advancements in the field of LSBs with a particular focus on the role of in situ methodology. In situ methods often require adapted cell designs and significant resources to achieve useful results. It is, therefore, an opportune time to take stock as to what advancements have been made in LSBs thanks to in situ methods, where all previous ex situ methods have failed. The important details regarding implementing in situ characterization techniques to properly understand the mechanisms of LSBs are discussed, as are the major challenges associated with these methods.

High-performance all-solid-state electrolyte for sodium batteries enabled by the interaction between the anion in salt and Na3SbS4,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryAll-solid-state sodium batteries with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based electrolytes have shown great promise for large-scale energy storage applications. However, the reported PEO-based electrolytes still suffer from a low Na+ transference number and poor ionic conductivity, which mainly result from the simultaneous migration of Na+ and anions, the high crystallinity of PEO, and the low concentration of free Na+. Here, we report a high-performance PEO-based all-solid-state electrolyte for sodium batteries by introducing Na3SbS4 to interact with the TFSI− anion in the salt and decrease the crystallinity of PEO. The optimal PEO/NaTFSI/Na3SbS4 electrolyte exhibits a remarkably enhanced Na+ transference number (0.49) and a high ionic conductivity of 1.33 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 45 °C. Moreover, we found that the electrolyte can largely alleviate Na+ depletion near the electrode surface in symmetric cells and, thus, contributes to stable and dendrite-free Na plating/stripping for 500 h. Furthermore, all-solid-state Na batteries with a 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride cathode exhibit a high capacity retention of 84% after 200 cycles and superior rate performance (up to 10C).

Memory Effects' Mechanism in the Intercalation Batteries: The Particles' Bipolarization,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.To develop energy-storage devices, understanding their charge-discharge behaviors and their underlying mechanisms is mandatory. Memory effect (ME) is among the most important behaviors that should be understood, influencing the batteries' applications. In this paper, the intercalation batteries' ME and their features are justified and explained by employing the particles' bipolarization mechanism. Diffuse regions, located in both sides of the reactant/product phases, turn the particles into dipoles (bipolarized particles) during/after the processes. This bipolarization and subsequent neutralization can explain many charge-discharge behaviors, including the ME. Here, the mechanism explains and justifies all the known features and some aspects of the phenomena which have not been considered so far. According to the proposed mechanism, the aged-neutralized particles react later and in a higher voltage than the fresh-neutralized particles, causing a bump in the curve called the ME. It is the same mechanism that causes the increase in the charge voltage by increasing the open-circuit voltage rest time. Our experiments sufficiently verified the mechanism. In the paper, impacts of the average particle size, relaxation/rest time, discharge cutoff voltage of the memory-writing cycle (MWC), Li-mobility kinetics, current rate, state of charge, depth of discharge of the MWC, boundaries of the charge-discharge curve, and so forth are considered, and their influences on the ME are explained. This mechanism sheds light on the relevant characteristics of the batteries and helps design, tune, control, and engineer the behaviors.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Size Effect of MgO on the Ionic Conduction Properties of a LiBH4·1/2NH3-MgO Nanocomposite,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.A solid-state electrolyte (SSE) is the core component for fabricating solid-state batteries competitive with the currently commercial Li-ion batteries. In the present study, a LiBH4·1/2NH3-MgO nanocomposite has been developed as a fast Li-ion conductor. The conductive properties depend strongly on the size of MgO nanopowders. By adding MgO nanoparticles, the first-order transition at 55 °C observed in the crystalline LiBH4·1/2NH3is suppressed due to the conversion of LiBH4·1/2NH3into the amorphous state. When the size of MgO decreases from 163.6 to 13.9 nm, the MgO amount required for the phase-Transition suppression of LiBH4·1/2NH3decreases linearly from 92 to 75 wt %, accompanied by a significant enhancement of ionic conductivity. The optimized nanocomposite with 75 wt % MgO of size 13.9 nm exhibits a pronouncedly high conductivity of 4.0 × 10-3S cm-1at room temperature, which is 20 times higher than that of the crystalline LiBH4·1/2NH3. Furthermore, a smaller size MgO contributes to a higher electrochemical stability window (ESW) owing to the stronger interfacial interaction via B-O bonds, i.e., an ESW of 4.0 V is achieved with the addition of 75 wt % MgO of size 13.9 nm.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Moreover, implementing favorable areal capacity and longevous cycling of a high-loading K-Se battery remains a daunting challenge facing commercial applications. Herein, we devise a Se and CoNiSe2 coembedded nanoreactor (Se/CoNiSe2-NR) affording low carbon content as an advanced cathode for K-Se batteries. We systematically uncover the enhanced K2Se2/K2Se adsorption and promoted K+ diffusion behavior with the incorporation of Co throughout theoretical simulation and electrokinetic analysis. As a result, Se/CoNiSe2-NR harvests high cycling stability with a capacity decay rate of 0.038% per cycle over 950 cycles at 1.0 C. More encouragingly, equipped with a 3D-printed Se/CoNiSe2-NR electrode with tunable Se loadings, K-Se full batteries enable steady cycling at an elevated Se loading of 3.8 mg cm-2.

Emergence of long afterglow and room temperature phosphorescence emissions from ultra-small sulfur dots,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sulfur dots (S-dots) are one of the most recently developed non-metallic luminescent nanomaterials and possess several advantages over traditional inorganic quantum dots (QDs). Here, we have synthesized highly luminescent ultra-small S-dots using a facile single-step mechanical grinding-assisted technique without consuming additional energy in terms of heat, time, pressure, and harsh chemical treatment. The morphological features are characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and are further correlated with elemental analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results suggest the formation of highly homogenous ultra-small S-dots with specific functional groups on the surface. The photophysical properties of the as-synthesized S-dots are characterized by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Furthermore, a temperature-dependent PL study has been carried out and it is correlated with the structural features of S-dots. Finally, these ultra-small S-dots show efficient room-temperature phosphorescence and long-term afterglow (up to 5 s) while embedded into B2O3 and biuret matrixes. The mechanistic insight behind the phosphorescence emission, the kinetics of phosphorescence, and furthermore their correlation with elemental/structural features has been investigated in depth.

Anthozoan-like porous nanocages with nano-cobalt-armed CNT multifunctional layers as a cathode material for highly stable Na-S batteries,"© the Partner Organisations.The capacity decay of room temperature Na-S batteries is mainly caused by the poor electronic conductivity, shuttle effect, and volume expansion of sulfur/polysulfides (NaPSs). Herein, anthozoan-like nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanocages with a nano-Co-armed carbon nanotube (CNT) multifunctional layer are proposed to improve the stability of Na-S batteries effectively. In this unique structure, the nano-Co-armed CNT functional layer not only enhances the adsorption of soluble NaPSs through Co-S bonding but also efficiently catalyzes their conversion to Na2Sx (2 ≤ x ≤ 6). The hollow and porous nanocages provide a buffer space for volume expansion of the electrode material during the cycle. The nitrogen-doped highly graphitized carbon has high electronic conductivity. As the cathode material in room temperature (RT) Na-S batteries, the proposed material with a nano-Co-armed CNT functional layer delivered an improved stable electrochemical performance and achieved 314.8 mA h g-1 at 0.5 C with a 0.025% decay rate per cycle for 1000 cycles, high coulombic efficiency (∼100%), and excellent capacity rate (426.1 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C, 351.8 mA h g-1 at 0.5 C, and 411.9 mA h g-1 when back to 0.1 C).",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers
"Understanding sodium storage properties of ultra-small Fe3S4nanoparticles-a combined XRD, PDF, XAS and electrokinetic study","© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Various electrode materials are considered for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and one important prerequisite for developments of SIBs is a detailed understanding about charge storage mechanisms. Herein, we present a rigorous study about Na storage properties of ultra-small Fe3S4 nanoparticles, synthesized applying a solvothermal route, which exhibit a very good electrochemical performance as anode material for SIBs. A closer look into electrochemical reaction pathways on the nanoscale, utilizing synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption techniques, reveals a complicated conversion mechanism. Initially, separation of Fe3S4 into nanocrystalline intermediates occurs accompanied by reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ cations. Discharge to 0.1 V leads to formation of strongly disordered Fe0 finely dispersed in a nanosized Na2S matrix. The resulting volume expansion leads to a worse long-term stability in the voltage range 3.0-0.1 V. Adjusting the lower cut-off potential to 0.5 V, crystallization of Na2S is prevented and a completely amorphous intermediate stage is formed. Thus, the smaller voltage window is favorable for long-term stability, yielding highly reversible capacity retention, e.g., 486 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles applying 0.5 A g-1 and superior coulombic efficiencies >99.9%. During charge to 3.0 V, Fe3S4 with smaller domains are reversibly generated in the 1st cycle, but further cycling results in loss of structural long-range order, whereas the local environment resembles that of Fe3S4 in subsequent charged states. Electrokinetic analyses reveal high capacitive contributions to the charge storage, indicating shortened diffusion lengths and thus, redox reactions occur predominantly at surfaces of nanosized conversion products.",Nanoscale
Evolution of “adsorption-insertion” K+ storage behaviors in flower-like carbons with tunable heteroatom doping and graphitic structures,"© The Royal Society of ChemistryExpanding the graphitic interlayer spacing and introducing heteroatoms into the carbon structure are the two key strategies for boosting the potassium storage performance. To fundamentally clarify the relation of graphitic structures and heteroatom-doping in carbon with the potassium storage behavior, carbons with diverse heteroatom-doping levels and microstructures (N,S-CNSs) are produced. It has been recognized that the potassium storage mechanism in N,S-CNSs can be described as an “adsorption-insertion” mechanism: the highly disordered/pseudo-graphitic carbon structure with rich defective sites contributing to a high-potential sloping region by “adsorption” and the graphitic carbon structure contributing to a low-potential plateau region by “insertion”. By tuning the “adsorption” and “insertion” mechanisms, N,S-CNS-1200 with a highly developed graphitic structure can provide a satisfactory reversible specific capacity of ∼300 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 44.9%, a high “insertion” capacity contribution of 57.9%, and a high capacity retention ratio of 81.9% after 1000 cycles. Moreover, kinetic analysis and ex situ XRD studies show that the kinetic diffusion of K+ in N,S-CNS-1200 is more advantageous. This work clearly clarifies the pivotal role of tuning the heteroatom doping and graphitic structure of carbons for realizing highly accessible graphitic structures for advanced potassium ion batteries.",Sustainable Energy and Fuels
Dual-role magnesium aluminate ceramic film as an advanced separator and polysulfide trapper in a Li-S battery: experimental and DFT investigations,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche ScientifiqueDeveloping an advanced separator that can stop polysulfide shuttling remains a work-in-progress in the Li-S battery domain. Most of the work reported so far concentrates on functionalizing the commercial Celgard® separator such that it can trap polysulfides, preventing their shuttling to Li anode. In this study, we have developed a flexible MgAl2O4 (MAO) separator, which plays a dual role as separator and polysulfide adsorber. To effectively utilize the adsorbed polysulfide on MAO, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were coated on MAO, which slows down the capacity decay of the Li-S battery. As a result, the Li-S cell with MAO/MWCNT separator delivers a stable capacity of ∼500 mA h g−1 for 250 cycles, higher than the capacity delivered by the Li-S cell with Celgard® separator. Furthermore, UV-Visible spectroscopy of the polysulfide solution exposed to MAO demonstrates polysulfide's binding ability with MAO. Furthermore, our density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the adsorption of polysulfides on the MAO.",New Journal of Chemistry
Connecting battery technologies for electric vehicles from battery materials to management,"© 2022 The Author(s)Vehicle electrification has always been a hot topic and gradually become a major role in the automobile manufacturing industry over the last two decades. This paper presented comprehensive discussions and insightful evaluations of both conventional electric vehicle (EV) batteries (such as lead-acid, nickel-based, lithium-ion batteries, etc.) and the state-of-the-art battery technologies (such as all-solid-state, silicon-based, lithium-sulphur, metal-air batteries, etc.). Battery major component materials, operating characteristics, theoretical models, manufacturing processes, and end-of-life management were thoroughly reviewed. Different from other reviews focusing on theoretical studies, this review emphasized the key aspects of battery technologies, commercial applications, and lifecycle management. Useful battery managing technologies such as health prediction, charging and discharging, as well as thermal runaway prevention were thoroughly discussed. Two novel hexagon radar charts of all-round evaluations of most reigning and potential EV battery technologies were created to predict the development trend of the EV battery technologies. It showed that lithium-ion batteries (3.9 points) would be still the dominant product for the current commercial EV power battery market in a short term. However, some cutting-edge technologies such as an all-solid-state battery (3.55 points) and silicon-based battery (3.3 points) are highly likely to be the next-generation EV onboard batteries with both higher specific power and better safety performance.",iScience
Fabrication and Porous Architecture of Crosslinked Polyimides for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries and Their Electrochemical Properties,"© 2022 American Chemical SocietyPorous organic polymers (POPs) as lithium-sulfur battery cathode hosts have acquired comprehensive interest owing to various fabrication strategies and multifunctions (tuned porous confinement and intense chemisorption anchoring) for the improved battery performance. Currently, the exploitation of POPs with well-constructed porous frameworks and adequate polar substances is reviewed as an efficient approach. Herein, we provide crosslinked porous polyimides (CR-PPIs) on the basis of traditional polymerization and crosslinking reaction. These materials give adequate space for accommodating LiPSs and relieve shuttle behaviors through the coordinated function of physical confinement (hierarchical micropores) and intense chemisorption anchoring (high-content polar heteroatom N). CR-PPIs composited with carbon nanotubes expedite charge/ion migration through the valid storage method and transport pathway. Moreover, benefiting from the high-content pyrrolic and pyrrolic N species, S/CR-PPI-PE has superior electrochemical properties between these composites.",Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research
Unveiling the Electrochemical Mechanism of High-Capacity Negative Electrode Model-System BiFeO3in Sodium-Ion Batteries: An in Operando XAS Investigation,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Careful development and optimization of negative electrode (anode) materials for Na-ion batteries (SIBs) are essential, for their widespread applications requiring a long-term cycling stability. BiFeO3 (BFO) with a LiNbO3-type structure (space group R3c) is an ideal negative electrode model system as it delivers a high specific capacity (770 mAh g-1), which is proposed through a conversion and alloying mechanism. In this work, BFO is synthesized via a sol-gel method and investigated as a conversion-type anode model-system for sodium-ion half-cells. As there is a difference in the first and second cycle profiles in the cyclic voltammogram, the operating mechanism of charge-discharge is elucidated using in operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In the first discharge, Bi is found to contribute toward the electrochemical activity through a conversion mechanism (Bi3+ → Bi0), followed by the formation of Na-Bi intermetallic compounds. Evidence for involvement of Fe in the charge storage mechanism through conversion of the oxide (Fe3+) form to metallic Fe and back during discharging/charging is also obtained, which is absent in previous literature reports. Reversible dealloying and subsequent oxidation of Bi and oxidation of Fe are observed in the following charge cycle. In the second discharge cycle, a reduction of Bi and Fe oxides is observed. Changes in the oxidation states of Bi and Fe, and the local coordination changes during electrochemical cycling are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the optimization of cycling stability of BFO is carried out by varying binders and electrolyte compositions. Based on that, electrodes prepared with the Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder are chosen for optimization of the electrolyte composition. BFO-CMC electrodes exhibit the best electrochemical performance in electrolytes containing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the additive. BFO-CMC electrodes deliver initial capacity values of 635 and 453 mAh g-1 in the Na-insertion (discharge) and deinsertion (charge) processes, respectively, in the electrolyte composition of 1 M NaPF6 in EC/DEC (1:1, v/v) with a 2% FEC additive. The capacity values stabilize around 10th cycle and capacity retention of 73% is observed after 60 cycles with respect to the 10th cycle charge capacity.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Robust nanocube framework CoS2-based composites as high-performance anodes for Li- and Na-ion batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdRobust hierarchical nanocube framework CoS2-based composites comprising of nanocrystalline CoS2 (∼8–10 nm) encapsulated in a robust carbon-core matrix entangled in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were synthesized, and their performance as electrodes for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and Na-ion batteries (NIBs) was evaluated. The robust nanocube framework CoS2-C-CNT composites were synthesized from Co-based metal-organic frameworks by an efficient two-step synthesis process of carbonization and sulfidation. The structural phase change mechanism of CoS2 was systematically characterized by ex situ analysis tools, which revealed that it involved a conversion during Li/Na-insertion and a recombination reaction during Li/Na-extraction. The unique structural characteristics of the nanocube framework CoS2-C-CNT composites and the unique structural phase change mechanism of CoS2 are attributed to the superior Li/Na-storage performances. The nanocube framework CoS2-C-CNT composites delivered a large reversible capacity (LIB: 770 mAh g−1 and NIB: 629 mAh g−1), excellent cycling (LIB: 726 mAh g−1 after 250 cycles and NIB: 531 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles), and fast rate behavior (LIB: 613 mAh g−1 at 3C and NIB: 391 mAh g−1 at 2C rates). This remarkable robust nanocube framework composite structure is highly applicable to various LIB/NIB electrode materials owing to their excellent Li/Na-ion storage characteristics.",Composites Part B: Engineering
"Nanoribbons of 2D materials: A review on emerging trends, recent developments and future perspectives","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The exclusive characteristic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials have enticed most of the researchers and scientific community to employ a plethora of pioneering stratagems in order to puzzle out modern-day problems. Some of the possibilities are currently are at theoretical phases, while some of them are well-explored experimentally. Nanoribbon-like structures of the 2D materials are ancillary entrants for 2D nanosheets with tunable and enhanced properties. Protuberant properties like abundant and highly exposed active sites on the edges facilitated electron transfer, and superior charge mobility, etc. make them poles apart from their bulk counterparts.

"Encapsulation of selenium in MOF-derived N,O-codoped porous flower-like carbon host for Na-Se batteries","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Na-Se batteries have their drawbacks such as large volumetric expansion and shuttle effect related to generation of soluble sodium polyselenides. To address these issues, a nitrogen and oxygen codoped flower-like porous carbon host is derived from a Ni-based metal–organic framework (MOF) for Se storage. The use of 4,4′-oxybisbenzoic acid and 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridyl ligands ensure the in-situ doping of the carbon host with oxygen and nitrogen upon carbonization of MOF, which increases its polarity and restricts the diffusion of selenium. Highly porous microflower-like carbon morphology provides sufficient space for Se storage. To avoid undesirable aggregation of Se particles which happens when using conventional melt-diffusion method, we employed a vapor-infiltration method for Se loading, which ensures the homogeneous dispersion of selenium and high utilization of pores in the carbon host. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that the increased polarity of the carbon host due to N,O codoping promotes the adsorption of polyselenides. When tested as a cathode for sodium-selenium battery, the optimized carbon/selenium composite shows an excellent electrochemical performance.",Chemical Engineering Journal
BiOI nanosheets-wrapped carbon fibers as efficient electrocatalyst for bidirectional polysulfide conversion in Li–S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries involve intricate electrochemical processes containing the formation and conversion of polysulfides, in which the shuttle effect and slow reaction kinetics impair its practical performance. Exploring new electrocatalyst with strong catalytic ability can greatly accelerate the conversion of polysulfides in Li-S batteries. Herein, BiOI/carbon fibers (BiOI/CFs) core–shell composite has been prepared by a facile electrospinning combined with solvothermal method and used as a promising electrocatalyst. The BiOI nanosheets are cross-linked to form a porous three-dimensional network on the surface of carbon fibers. This architecture not only has the advantage of large aspect ratio, but also has a high specific surface area, which provides abundant active sites and ensures high electron/ion transfer for the electrocatalysis of lithium polysulfides. As expected, BiOI/CFs electrode presents a superior bidirectional oxidation–reduction ability for polysulfides. The first-principles calculations also prove the strong interaction between BiOI and polysulfides. Due to these advantages, BiOI/CFs can effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides, and possesses excellent electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries. The specific capacity of the BiOI/CFs-S electrode is stable at 1020 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.2C and 598 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5C. This work provides new insights for the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for polysulfide conversion.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"High-capacity, low-tortuosity LiFePO4-Based composite cathode enabled by self-supporting structure combined with laser drilling technology","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.A thick electrode with high areal capacity is a promising way to improve the energy density of batteries, but the development of a thick electrode is limited by poor mechanical stability and sluggish ion and electron transport. Here, we design a self-supporting cathode that consists of cellulose nanofibers, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and introduce a uniform microchannel structure to the cathode by laser drilling technology. The cellulose nanofibers and multi-walled carbon nanotubes construct a conductive network. The microchannel structure enables outstanding ion and electron transport and significantly improves the rate capability of the electrode. Meanwhile, the local heat by the laser produces an amorphous carbon layer on the inner surface of the microchannel, which helps form a stable cathode-electrolyte interface and enhances the capacity retention of the thick electrode. Notably, the drilled thick cathode with an LFP load of 40 mg cm−2 and an areal capacity of 5.33 mAh cm−2 exhibits substantially improved cycling stability at 0.5C than the undrilled samples. This work demonstrates a promising design concept for thick electrodes to high-performance energy storage devices.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Direct confirmation of confinement effects by NiO confined in helical SnO2nanocoils and its application in sensors,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Confinement effects in space-confined catalysts are attracting attention due to their advantages, like size control, unique nanoscale chemical environments and designable nature of the active sites. There are rarely works on the direct confirmation of confinement effects because of restrictions of nanoscale confined space. Herein, we report the fabrication of a novel structure that is composed of NiO nanoparticles confined in SnO2 nanocoils (I-NiSnNCs) via atomic layer deposition (ALD). The I-NiSnNCs displayed higher sensing performance towards hydrogen than the NiO-SnO2 film, NiO outside NiSnNC and NiO both outside and inside NiSnNC sensors. The I-NiSnNC sensor shows a response to about 7 to 50 ppm H2 with a 2.4 s response time and 4.2 s recovery time at 260 °C and excellent repeatability. The synergistic effect of interfacial sites is attributed to the reaction between adsorbed H on NiO and adsorbed O at interfacial active sites. The ""funneling effect""formed because the enrichment effect of hydrogen on the NiO surface is higher than that of the gas state as the adsorbed H quickly reacts at interfacial active sites. The enrichment effects of H2 lead to high sensing performance to H2, and the high reactivity of H2 at interfacial active sites leading to rapid transfer of electrons is responsible for the high response/recovery performance. The gas sensor offers a new way to directly confirm the confinement effect. And the confinement effects in return give a novel way to design sensing materials.

Electrocatalytic Activity of Polyaniline in Magnesium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Rechargeable magnesium-sulfur (Mg-S) batteries offer the potential for inexpensive energy storage alternatives to other metal-ion batteries for the grid scale and household applications. Despite all economic and resource advantages, Mg-S battery chemistry suffers from a complicated reaction mechanism and extremely slow reaction kinetics. To improve the kinetics, we improvise a new electrode architecture where a conductive polymer is used along with a carbon network. This report will bring an important insight of electrocatalytic activity of polyaniline, on the basis of free-radical coupling and is a completely new concept in Mg-S battery chemistry. By the combined electron spin resonance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and fluorescence lifetime measurements, we perceived that the polyaniline anchors the S3•- species from the electrolyte/catholyte through a free-radical-coupling process and thus promotes the reduction to end-discharged products, via a chemical adduct. The concept of free-radical catalysis in Mg/S batteries will open a new knowledge to enhance the active material utilization in the Mg-S batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters
Three-dimensional nitrogen-doped dual carbon network anode enabling high-performance sodium-ion hybrid capacitors,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdIt is urgent for sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) to exploit a porous carbon anode that integrates high reversible specific capacity, rapid kinetics and superb cyclability. Herein, a three-dimensional dumpling-like glyururil-derived porous carbon@RGO composite (GLCG) constructed from nitrogen-doped (10.29 at.%) hierarchical porous carbon filling and highly conductive flexible RGO wrapper is synthesized. As for the Na half-cell, GLCG anode delivers high reversible specific capacity (282 mAhg-1 at 0.05 Ag−1) as well as superb rate capability (122.8 mAhg-1 at 10 Ag−1) and lifespan (3000 cycles at 2 Ag−1). Moreover, the origin of the excellent sodium-ion storage properties of GLCG is revealed by in-depth mechanism analysis. Consequently, a SIHCs with GLCG anode is constructed, which displays high energy density of 108 Wh kg−1, high power density of 14.2 kW kg−1 and long lifespan of 66% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 2 Ag−1. This work provides an alternative avenue for the exploitation of high-performance carbon-based SIHCs anode.",Electrochimica Acta
Effect of Mg Cation Diffusion Coefficient on Mg Dendrite Formation,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Dendrite formation is an important issue for the metal anode-based battery system. The traditional perception that Mg metal anode does not grow dendrite during operation has been challenged recently. Herein, we investigate the Mg electrodeposition behavior in a 0.3 M all-phenyl-complex (APC) electrolyte and confirm that Mg dendrites are readily formed at high current densities. A semiquantitative model indicates that the Mg-ion concentration on the electrode surface, limited by the intrinsic diffusion coefficient of the Mg cation group, decreases with increasing current density, resulting in an extra concentration polarization. However, Mg deposition at the tip of a protrusion on the electrode surface is hardly affected by the concentration polarization, and thus dendrite growth is more prone to occur at the tips. We find that the addition of LiCl in conventional APC electrolytes can suppress the Mg dendrite formation, mainly as a result of the enhanced Mg cation diffusion coefficient due to the influence of the LiCl additive, rather than the less pronounced electrostatic shield effect provided by Li cations.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Stable Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries in Ether-Based Electrolytes Enabled by the Fluoroethylene Carbonate Additive,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Because of its high energy density and low cost, the room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery is a promising candidate to power the next-generation large-scale energy storage system. However, its practical utilization is hampered by the short life span owing to the severe shuttle effect, which originates from the ""solid-liquid-solid""reaction mechanism of the sulfur cathode. In this work, fluoroethylene carbonate is proposed as an additive, and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether is used as the base solvent. For the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode, a robust F-containing cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) forms on the cathode surface during the initial discharging. The CEI prohibits the dissolution and diffusion of the soluble intermediate products, realizing a ""solid-solid""reaction process. The RT Na-S cell exhibits a stable cycling performance: a capacity of 587 mA h g-1 is retained after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Toward Theoretical Capacity and Superhigh Power Density for Potassium-Selenium Batteries via Facilitating Reversible Potassiation Kinetics,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Potassium-selenium (K-Se) batteries attract tremendous attention because of the two-electron transfer of the selenium cathode. Nonetheless, practical K-Se cells normally display selenium underutilization and unsatisfactory rate capability. Herein, we employ a synergistic spatial confinement and architecture engineering strategy to establish selenium cathodes for probing the effect of K+ diffusion kinetics on K-Se battery performance and improving the charge transfer efficiency at ultrahigh rates. By impregnating selenium into hollow and solid carbon spheres with similar diameters and porous structures, the obtained parallel Se/C composites possess nearly identical selenium loadings, molecular structures, and heterogeneous interfaces but enormously different paths for K+ diffusion. Remarkably, as the solid-state K+ diffusion distance is significantly reduced, the K-Se cell achieves 96% of 2e- transfer capacity (647.1 mA h g-1). Reversible capacities of 283.5 and 224.1 mA h g-1 are obtained at 7.5 and 15C, respectively, corresponding to an unprecedented high power density of 8777.8 W kg-1. Quantitative kinetic analysis demonstrated a twofold higher capacitive charge storage contribution and a 1 order of magnitude higher K+ diffusion coefficient due to the short K+ diffusion path. By combining the determination of potassiation products by ex situ characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is identified that the kinetic factor is decisive for K-Se battery performances.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Stabilizing Sodium Metal Anodes with Surfactant-Based Electrolytes and Unraveling the Atomic Structure of Interfaces by Cryo-TEM,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Sodium (Na) metal batteries are promising as next-generation energy storage systems due to the high specific capacity of the Na metal anode as well as rich natural abundance and low cost of Na resources. Nevertheless, uncontrolled growth of dendritic/mossy Na arising from the unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) leads to rapid electrode degradation and severe safety issues. In this work, we introduce cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as an electrolyte additive that enables a synergistic effect from both the CTA+ cation and Br- anion in stabilizing the Na metal anode. Notably, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy is utilized to investigate the effect of the additive, revealing the critical morphology and structure of the SEIs and Na electrodes at the nano/atomic scale. Benefiting fromthe additive, a stable Na anode can be realized at an ultrahigh capacity of 30 mAh cm-2 at 10 mA cm-2 over 400 h.",Nano Letters
Nominally stoichiometric Na3(WxSixSb1−2x)S4 as a superionic solid electrolyte†,"This journal is © the Partner OrganisationsNa3MX4 (M = P, Sb and X = S, Se) and its doped analogues are considered as a promising material in room-temperature (RT) Na+-conducting solid electrolytes. Herein, we first report that stoichiometric Na3(WxSixSb1−2x)S4 with no nominal vacancies shows significantly high ionic conductivity at RT (σRT) when compared with Na3SbS4. The σRT increases continuously with increases in ‘x’, revealing the highest σRT of 13.2 mS cm−1 and the lowest activation of 0.16 eV in cubic Na3(W0.2Si0.2Sb0.6)S4. Further increases in ‘x’ result in the formation of a glassy phase and a reduction in σRT. The σRT of Na3(W0.2Si0.2Sb0.6)S4 is the highest in stoichiometric Na3MX4 known to date and suggests that the Na+ diffusion is influenced by the dopant types as well as structural defects. Ab initio molecular dynamics also reveal the improvement of σRT with increases in ‘x’, but the presence of naturally formed vacancies that are commonly observed in Na3MX4. The electronic conductivity of Na3(W0.2Si0.2Sb0.6)S4 is also low (ca. 10−6 mS cm−1). However, the cathodic stability is insufficient when W6+ and/or Si4+ are doped. Therefore, a solid-state cell (Na15Sn4∥TiS2) is fabricated with an interlayer of Na3SbS4 between Na15Sn4 and Na3(W0.2Si0.2Sb0.6)S4, and its excellent compatibility with a cathode is demonstrated.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers
Porous graphene-like MoS2/carbon hierarchies for high-performance pseudocapacitive sodium storage,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Layered MoS2 has been considered as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but it suffers from low electric/ionic conductivity as well as severe volume variation upon ion insertion/extraction, which leads to poor electrochemical performance. To address this issue, we demonstrate a facile synthesis of graphene-like MoS2/carbon (denoted as MoS2/C) with porous hierarchical nanostructures, in which few-layered MoS2 with expanded (002) planes is successfully hybridized/doped with N,S-codoped carbon species, via a template-assisted nanocasting method. The simultaneous thermal decomposition of the Mo/S source (i.e., (NH4)2MoS4) and the N/C source (i.e., polyvinyl pyrrolidone, PVP) within the confined spaces constructed by the removable template (i.e., CaCO3) leads to the straightforward hybridization/doping of MoS2/C, and the carbon content can be readily controlled by adjusting the amount of PVP introduced, which greatly affects the sodium storage performance of the electrodes. After template removal, the as-prepared porous MoS2/C hierarchies constructed by graphene-like nanosheets display a large pore volume and highly exposed active surface, which efficiently enhance the electrical conductivity and the ion diffusivity. When evaluated as an anode material for SIBs, the optimized MoS2/C electrode demonstrates predominantly pseudocapacitive sodium storage behavior (with a high contribution of 89.9% at 1.2 mV s-1), delivering high reversible capacities of 397 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 300 cycles and 370 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles.

Boundaries of charge-discharge curves of batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Understanding the underlying mechanisms of the charge-discharge behaviour of batteries, especially Li-ion and Na-ion intercalation ones, is obligatory to develop and design energy storage devices. The behaviour of the voltage-capacity/time (V-C/T) diagram is one of the most critical issues which should be understood. This paper aims to elucidate the boundaries of the charge-discharge V-C/T curves, i.e. their beginning and end arches. By reviewing the literature, it can be found that the shape of the beginning arch of the V-C/T curves under (dis)charge seems to remain almost unchanged upon changing some conditions such as charging or discharging, additives, morphologies, heat treatments, number of cycles, operation temperature, and even current rate. In contrast, the curves' end arch changes with the conditions. The phenomenon is explained based on the bipolarization of the cathode particles' mechanism. Influences of the current rate and particle size on the V-C/T curves are investigated. Accordingly, a general mathematical relationship is proposed here for the V-T curves' boundaries. The relationship is in good agreement with experimental data of various Li/Na-ion cathode materials (as case studies) taken from the literature for various conditions, cells, and cathode powders. Moreover, it is established that the relationship can predict (dis)charge time as a function of rate for both intercalation and conversion rechargeable batteries, including Li-ion, Na-ion, Li-S, Na-S, NiMH, and lead-acid batteries. It seems to be a key parameter to link various kinds of battery. The mechanism and its relative relationship provide new insights, and open new landscapes and evaluation fields for batteries' relevant characteristics, and help to understand, design, tune, control, and engineer behaviours.

Stainless steel mesh coated with defect engineered ZIF-67 toward pH-switchable wettability and efficient organic liquids separation,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In this work, stainless steel mesh coated with stearic acid and tetradecanedioic acid modulated ZIF-67 (SA+TDA/mZIF-67@SSM) was prepared via facile electrodeposition. The composite modulators supply defect engineering on the MOFs, endowing the as-prepared meshes with pH-switchable wettability. The ratio of modulators significantly affected the crystal morphology and wetting property of SA+TDA/mZIF-67@SSM, resulting from the competitive coordination between the modulation and crystal growth process. The SA+TDA/mZIF-67@SSM exhibited highly hydrophobic, while it became amphiphilic after soaked in alkaline solution because some exposed carboxylic acid groups on the mesh were deprotonated. The SA+TDA/mZIF-67@SSM achieved efficient and adjustable organic liquids separation, with the separation efficiency both up to 98% before and after the wettability transition. In addition, the SA+TDA/mZIF-67@SSM could realize the separation of oil/water/oil mixtures, with the separation efficiency larger than 98%. This work introduces a new technique of modulated MOFs coated mesh with pH-responsivity for separating organic liquids based on defect engineering.",Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects

Review - Contemporary Progresses in Carbon-Based Electrode Material in Li-S Batteries,"© 2022 Electrochemical Society Inc.. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur batteries are among the rising rechargeable batteries due to their high energy density, theoretical capacity, and low cost. However, their large-scale application is delayed by several challenges, such as degradation due to polysulfide dissolution, low conductivity, and other restricting factors. Li-S batteries have undergone decades of development aimed at improving battery performance by altering the electrode material to overcome these challenges. In the meantime, due to the depletion of fossil fuels and growing energy demand, the need for changes in processes to improve battery performance is now more urgent than ever. Carbon-based materials like conducting polymers, carbon nanotubes, Graphene, and activated Carbon have gained extensive attention due to their low cost, easy availability, good cycling stability, and exceptional electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. Here, we summarize recent progress in carbon-based electrode material in Li-S batteries, the development of electrolytes, and progress in adopting lithium-sulfur batteries as flexible devices. Furthermore, a comparison of Li-S batteries based on similar parameters with its rechargeable battery competitors is discussed and a comparison with other non-carbon-based electrodes used in the lithium-sulfur battery is also examined. Finally, a general conclusion and future directions are given.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
Towards autonomous high-throughput multiscale modelling of battery interfaces,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.To date, battery research largely follows an ""Edisonian""approach based on experimental trial-and-error in contrast to a systematic strategy of design-of-experiments. Battery interfaces are arguably the most important yet the least understood components of energy storage devices. To transform the way we perform battery research, theory and computations can be used simultaneously to understand and guide the design of meaningful and targeted experiments. However, it is well known that modelling of battery interfaces is computationally prohibitive in terms of both resources and time due to the large size of systems to provide realistic and descriptive models. Recently, automated and intelligent in silico tools have been developed to accelerate the description of materials, such as workflows designed to generate, handle and analyse hundreds of thousands of materials data and at different scales. Here, we assess the latest computational strategies, outline unresolved questions, and propose future directions that will guide and drive future developments of interfaces in energy storage devices. The future directions include the development of complementary experimental techniques, such as high-throughput automated materials synthesis, operando characterization, cell assembly and integrated platforms for device testing.",Energy and Environmental Science
Two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3C2T: X ) MXenes to inhibit the shuttle effect in sodium sulfur batteries,"© the Owner Societies.Room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries (RT-NSBs) are among the promising candidates for large-scale energy storage applications because of the natural abundance of the electrode materials and impressive energy density. However, one of the main technical challenges of RT-NSBs is the shuttle effect by which active redox intermediates (i.e., sodium polysulfides Na2Sn, n = 1-8) are dissolved in electrolytes, which hamper the battery reversibility. The interfacial interplays between Na2Sn and the electrodes (or electrolytes) at the atomic level thus play an intrinsic role in elucidating the shuttle effect. This work reports the ab initio calculations to unravel the suppression of the shuttle effect using titanium carbide MXenes (Ti3C2Tx, Tx = F, O) as the cathode additives. The findings reveal that the shuttle phenomenon is efficiently resolved because the immense chemical bonding of Na2Sn-Ti3C2Tx interfaces competitively surpasses the binding magnitudes of Na2Sn-electrolyte interaction. The analysis of the electronic density of states and charge density further manifests that there is charge donation from the Na-3s orbital of Na2Sn to the unfilled F(O)-2p orbitals of metallic Ti3C2Tx. The metallicity of the Ti3C2Tx remains preserved during the entire course of the redox process, ensuring the rapid electrochemical kinetics. Furthermore, the presence of Ti3C2Tx additives drastically reduces the dissociation barrier of the final redox product Na2S, yielding the efficient utilization of sulfur during the discharge process. This work has proposed the unexplored functionality of Ti3C2Tx as the anchoring materials for RT-NSBs.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
The chemical evolution of solid electrolyte interface in sodium metal batteries,"Copyright © 2022 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. Distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial License 4.0 (CC BY-NC).The solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formed on the anode is one of the key factors that determine the life span of sodium metal batteries (SMBs). However, the continuous evolution of SEI during charging/discharging processes complicates the fundamental understanding of its chemistry and structure. In this work, we studied the underlying mechanisms of the protection effect offered by the SEI derived from sodium difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB). In situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shows that the prior reduction of DFOB anion contributes to the SEI formation, and it suppresses the decomposition of carbonate solvents. Depth-profiling x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution solid-state NMR reveal that the DFOB anion is gradually turned into borate and fluoride-rich SEI with cycling. The protection effect of SEI reaches the optimum at 50 cycles, which triples the life span of SMB. The detailed investigations provide valuable guidelines for the SEI engineering.",Science Advances
Single-atom catalysts for lithium sulfur batteries via atomic layer deposition process,"© 2022 The Author(s)Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) has emerged as one of the foremost intriguing energy storage systems in the last decade, due to its higher energy density (ED), less expensive, and more environmentally friendly. However, the interface chemistries of electrode–electrolyte such as the shuttling effect of polysulfide and inadequate dynamic sulfur use have not yet been completely understood and managed when in operations, thus the employment of single-atom catalysts (SACs) provides the possibility to address these problems through the proper identification of structure–activity connexions and the chemical reaction processes at the atomic level. In this mini review, the usage of incredibly active SACs is examined with applications in long-lifecycle, higher-energy LSBs, as well as the possibility of SAC preparation using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to boost efficiency. Conclusively, the significant problems and future prospects for enhanced SACs via ALD in LSBs development are also discussed.",Electrochemistry Communications
Continuous Carbon Channels Enable Full Na-Ion Accessibility for Superior Room-Temperature Na–S Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHPorous carbon has been widely used as an efficient host to encapsulate highly active molecular sulfur (S) in Li–S and Na–S batteries. However, for these sub-nanosized pores, it is a challenge to provide fully accessible sodium ions with unobstructed channels during cycling, particularly for high sulfur content. It is well recognized that solid interphase with full coverage over the designed architectures plays critical roles in promoting rapid charge transfer and stable conversion reactions in batteries, whereas constructing a high-ionic-conductivity solid interphase in the pores is very difficult. Herein, unique continuous carbonaceous pores are tailored, which can serve as multifunctional channels to encapsulate highly active S and provide fully accessible pathways for sodium ions. Solid sodium sulfide interphase layers are also realized in the channels, showing high Na-ion conductivity toward stabilizing the redox kinetics of the S cathode during charge/discharge processes. This systematically designed carbon-hosted sulfur cathode delivers superior cycling performance (420 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 2000 cycles), high capacity retention of ≈90% over 500 cycles at current density of 0.5 A g−1, and outstanding rate capability (470 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1) for room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries.",Advanced Materials
Electrolytes/Interphases: Enabling Distinguishable Sulfur Redox Processes in Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHSodium and sulfur offer a promising application in rechargeable batteries due to their low cost, abundant resources and high energy density. Room-temperature (RT) Na–S batteries have been proposed by paring S cathodes with Na anodes in non-aqueous liquid electrolytes. Over decades, researchers have mainly focussed on the development of superior electrodes by nano-engineering efficient S cathodes and stable Na anodes. These studies have effectively improved the electrochemical performance of RT Na–S batteries, validating their bright prospects as stationary energy storage devices for the modern renewable energy trajectory. In comparison, the research on electrolytes receives much less attention, and there is a lack of understanding regarding the impacts of different electrolytes on electrode interfaces and overall battery mechanisms. In this review, multiple-kinds of electrolytes and the interfaces between electrolytes and electrodes in RT Na–S batteries are comprehensively discussed. Challenges and recent progress are presented in terms of the sulfur electrochemical mechanisms: The solid-solid and solid-liquid conversions.

Sulfurized Carbon Composite with Unprecedentedly High Tap Density for Sodium Storage,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHA novel sulfurized carbon decorated by terephthalic acid (TPA) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN), with unprecedently high tap density (≈1.02 g cm−3), is investigated. Room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries offer high energy density; however, the dissolution of the polysulfide is a major factor hindering their commercialization. This dissolution problem can be tolerated by inhibiting the formation of polysulfide through binding sulfur to the carbon structure of PAN. Low sulfur content and low volumetric energy density in the composite are other drawbacks to be resolved. Heat-treated TPA induces a high-density carbonaceous material with high conductivity. This TPA is partly replaced by PAN, and the produced carbon and sulfur are composited with dehydrated polyacrylonitrile (CS–DPAN), which exhibits higher conductivity and surface area than the sulfurized dehydrated polyacrylonitrile (S–DPAN). The CS–DPAN composite electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, and the resulting volumetric capacity is also superior to that of the S–DPAN material electrode. Operando Raman and operando X-ray diffraction analyses confirm that the increased capacity is realized via the avoidance of parasitic C60Na3 formation formed below 1 V, by adjusting the operation voltage range. This finding demonstrates the feasibility of carbon–sulfur composites as a high-energy electrode material for rechargeable sodium batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials

Construction of Large Non-Localized π-Electron System for Enhanced Sodium-Ion Storage,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Organic electrode materials with the advantages of renewability, environment-friendliness, low cost, and high capacity have received widespread attention in recent years for sodium-ion batteries. However, small molecular organic materials suffer from issues such as low conductivity and the high dissolution rate in electrolytes. Herein, a phthalocyanine derivative (TPcDS) with a large non-localized π-electron system, obtained through thermodynamic polymerization of 4-aminophthalonitrile (AP) monomers, is designed to address these issues. According to the density function theory calculation, six sodium ions can be attracted by one polymer molecule, indicating a high theoretical capacity of 375 mA h g-1. The TPcDS molecule realizes sodium storage through a non-localized π-electron system of phthalocyanine macrocycles. When employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the functional groups of phthalocyanine macrocycles, such as C-N groups in TPcDS, experience obviously reversible structural variation upon discharge/charge. A high reversible capacity of 364 mAh g-1 is achieved at a current density of 0.05 A g-1, and a charge capacity of as high as 246 mAh g-1 is still maintained after 500 cycles at 0.1 A g-1.

Manganese oxide as an effective electrode material for energy storage: a review,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Efficient materials for energy storage, in particular for supercapacitors and batteries, are urgently needed in the context of the rapid development of battery-bearing products such as vehicles, cell phones and connected objects. Storage devices are mainly based on active electrode materials. Various transition metal oxides-based materials have been used as active materials to produce electrodes. For instance, manganese-based oxides (MnxOy) have been used extensively as an electrode material due to higher specific capacitance, large potential range, and various crystal structures. Manganese (III) oxide (Mn2O3) has not been extensively explored as electrode material despite a high theoretical specific capacity value of 1018 mAh/g and multivalent cations: Mn3+ and Mn4+. Here, we review Mn2O3 strategic design, construction, morphology, and the integration with conductive species for energy storage applications. Improving the performance of Mn2O3-based electrodes requires the formation of nanostructure and blending with electrically-conductive matrices, and adjusting the morphology of the Mn2O3. Some issues of structural design for volume change, poor cyclic stability, characterization and understanding of ions transfer and transport within the Mn2O3-based electrodes are still unanswered.",Environmental Chemistry Letters
Effects of pressure on the chemical looping combustion of coal with CuFe2O4 combined oxygen carrier,"© 2021 Energy InstituteChemical looping combustion (CLC) has fast developed as an attractive technology for clean utilization of coal as well as inherent CO2 separation at the low energy penalty. Increase of the system pressure has been acknowledged as one of the effective measures in CLC for sufficient conversion of coal along with affiliated benefits for CO2 sequestration, but the complex consequences as incurred should be well considered. In this research, reaction of a typical Chinese bituminous coal of high sulfur content (designated as LZ) with CuFe2O4 combined oxygen carrier (OC) within 0.1–3.0 MPa in the CO2 atmosphere was systematically investigated, with focus on the effect of the system pressure to the conversion of LZ coal, transfer of the oxygen involved in CuFe2O4, sulfur evolution and redistribution. Sequential reactions of CuFe2O4 with the volatiles emitted from pyrolysis of LZ coal and further reaction with the released gasification products and residual char were accomplished, which was beneficial to overcome the mass transfer limitation of the reducing gases evolved from LZ coal to OC under the pressurized conditions and alleviate the inhibition effect resulting from accumulation of the transferred reactive gases around the surroundings of OC. And thus, under the pressurized conditions, improved conversion of LZ coal was reached by oxidization of more intractable C-C/C-H groups to oxygen bound carbon groups. Meanwhile, deep reduction of the added CuFe2O4 occurred with deficient Fe3O4 at the lower valence being formed, which would interact with the silicon minerals present in LZ coal to form various iron silicates. Furthermore, sulfur evolution from coal was found to directionally interact with the reduced CuFe2O4 to mainly form solid Cu2S due to their high combination potential. And deeper reduction of Cu2S was instigated especially at 3.0 MPa with Cu1.8S formed, and the total solid sulfur fraction was increased with the elevated system pressure. Overall, comprehensive information on the interaction of coal of high sulfur content with CuFe2O4 under the extended pressurized conditions around 0.1–3.0 MPa was provided, which would be meaningful for the realistic pressurized CLC in the future.",Journal of the Energy Institute
Nitrogen-doped ordered multi-hollow layered carbon embedded with Mo2C as lithium polysulfide restrained cathode for Li-S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are constrained due to the poor electrical conductivity of sulfur, the shuttle effect, and the volume expansion during the cycle. In this study, N-doped ordered multi-hollow layered carbon embedded with Mo2C is successfully prepared (Mo2C@NC-NaCl) under the co-regulation of dicyandiamide and sodium chloride on the carbon material. In the carbon material, the multi-hollow layered carbon skeleton derived from biomass acts as an advanced sulfur host, which can accelerate electron transportation and buffer volume changes. The synergistic effect of Mo2C nanoparticles and pyridine N anchors lithium polysulfides and realizes fast sulfur electrochemistry. Benefiting from the above advantages, Mo2C@NC-NaCl with a sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm−2 delivers a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1226.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C. Even at a high rate of 1 C, the battery still achieves an initial capacity of 853.7 mAh g−1 and the average capacity decay rate per cycle is 0.065% over 500 cycles. It is expected this work provides a new perspective for large-scale production of cathode materials for Li-S batteries.",Applied Surface Science
Vacancy and architecture engineering of porous FeP nanorods for achieving superior Li+ storage,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.With high theoretical capacity (926 mAh g−1) and safer voltage platform, Iron phosphide (FeP) as an anode material for lithium ion batteries has attracted a lot of attention. However, FeP also suffers serious capacity fading and unsatisfied rate capability, which are triggered by inferior intrinsic conductivity and large volume expansion. Herein, oriented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, MOF-derived porous FeP nanorods modified by abundant P vacancies (denoted as V-FeP) were ingeniously designed via a simplified approach to alleviate the above obstacles. As a result, the V-FeP nanorods electrode delivered extraordinary specific capacity (1228.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 120 cycles) and long-cyclic performance (590.7 mAh g−1 at 2.0 A g−1 after 1000 cycles). Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption fine structure, electron paramagnetic resonance and so on were used to character the V-FeP nanorods. The results indicated the supernormal electrochemical performances of V-FeP nanorods were originated from abundant P vacancies and good distribution of FeP nanoparticles in conductive carbon network, which enhanced electrical conductivity, provided more active sites, shortened the diffusion distances of Li ions and relieved the volume variations. The strategy demonstrates a further direction to effectively improve the lithium storage performance of transition metal phosphides.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Regulating the Deposition of Insoluble Sulfur Species for Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021, Jilin University, The Editorial Department of Chemical Research in Chinese Universities and Springer-Verlag GmbH.Room temperature sodium-sulfur(RT-Na-S) batteries are regarded as promising candidates for next-generation high-energy-density batteries. However, in addition to the severe shuttle effect, the inhomogeneous deposition of the insoluble sulfur species generated during the discharge/charge processes also contributes to the rapid capacity fade of RT-Na-S batteries. In this work, the deposition behavior of the insoluble sulfur species in the traditional slurry-coated sulfur cathodes is investigated using microporous carbon spheres as model sulfur host materials. To achieve uniform deposition of insoluble sulfur species, a self-supporting sulfur cathode fabricated by assembling microporous carbon spheres is designed. With homogeneous sulfur distribution and favorable electron transport pathway, the self-supporting cathode delivers remarkably enhanced rate capability(509 mA·h/g at 2.5 C, 1 C=1675 mA·h/g), cycling stability(718 mA·h/g after 480 cycles at 0.5 C) and areal capacity(4.98 mA·h/cm2 at 0.1 C), highlighting the great potential of manipulating insoluble sulfur species to fabricate high-performance RT-Na-S batteries.",Chemical Research in Chinese Universities
Graphene-Supported Atomically Dispersed Metals as Bifunctional Catalysts for Next-Generation Batteries Based on Conversion Reactions,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHNext-generation batteries based on conversion reactions, including aqueous metal–air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal-O2 and -CO2 batteries, alkali metal-chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal-ion batteries have attracted great interest. However, their use is restricted by inefficient reversible conversion of active agents. Developing bifunctional catalysts to accelerate the conversion reaction kinetics in both discharge and charge processes is urgently needed. Graphene-, or graphene-like carbon-supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G-ADMCs) have been demonstrated to show excellent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions, making them promising candidates. Different from G-ADMCs for catalysis, which only require high activity in one direction, G-ADMCs for rechargeable batteries should provide high activity in both discharging and charging. This review provides guidance for the design and fabrication of bifunctional G-ADMCs for next-generation rechargeable batteries based on conversion reactions. The key challenges that prevent their reversible conversion, the origin of the activity of bifunctional G-ADMCs, and the current design principles of bifunctional G-ADMCs for highly reversible conversion, have been analyzed and highlighted for each conversion-type battery. Finally, a summary and outlook on the development of bifunctional G-ADMC materials for next-generation batteries with a high energy density and excellent energy efficiency are given.",Advanced Materials
Recent Advanced Development of Artificial Interphase Engineering for Stable Sodium Metal Anodes,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHA solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on a sodium (Na) metal anode strongly affects the Na deposition morphology and the cycle life of Na metal batteries (SMBs). SMB applications are hindered by an unstable SEI and dendrite growth on the Na anode surface, which directly cause low coulombic efficiency and can even lead to safety issues. An artificial interface layer can stabilize Na metal anodes, be easily tailored, and is barely affected by electrochemical processes. In this review, recent advances that support the stability of working Na metal anodes are focused via artificial interphase engineering of inorganic materials, organic materials, and organic–inorganic composite materials, with an emphasis on the significance of interface engineering in SMBs. Fundamental investigations of artificial interphase engineering are also discussed on Na metal anodes and some recent research is summarized to enhance the interface between Na metal and electrolytes using an artificial interface layer. The prospects for interphase chemistry for Na metal anodes are provided to open a way to safe, high-energy, next-generation SMBs.",Small
Influence of microstructure and crystalline phases on impedance spectra of sodium conducting glass ceramics produced from glass powder,"© 2021, The Author(s).Crystallization of highly ionic conductive N5 (Na5YSi4O12) phase from melted Na3+3x-1Y1-xPySi3-yO9 parent glass provides an attractive pathway for cost-effective manufacturing of Na-ion conducting thin electrolyte substrates. The temperature-dependent crystallization of parent glass results in several crystalline phases in the microstructure (N3 (Na3YSi2O7), N5 and N8 (Na8.1Y Si6O18) phases) as well as in rest glass phase with temperature dependent viscosity. The electrical properties of dense parent glass and of compositions densified and crystallized at 700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C, 1000 °C, and 1100 °C are investigated by impedance spectroscopy and linked to their microstructure and crystalline phase content determined by Rietveld refinement. The parent glass has high isolation resistance and predominantly electrons as charge carriers. For sintering at ≥ 900 °C, sufficient N5 phase content is formed to exceed the percolation limit and form ion-conducting pathways. At the same time, the highest content of crystalline phase and the lowest grain boundary resistance are observed. Further increase of the sintering temperature leads to a decrease of the grain resistance and an increase of grain boundary resistance. The grain boundary resistance increases remarkably for samples sintered at 1100 °C due to softening of the residual glass phase and wetting of the grain boundaries. The conductivity of fully crystallized N5 phase (grain conductivity) is calculated from thorough impedance spectra analysis using its volume content estimated from Rietveld analysis, density measurements and assuming reasonable tortuosity to 2.8 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. The excellent conductivity and easy processing demonstrate the great potential for the use of this phase in the preparation of solid-state sodium electrolytes.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry
Urea-assisted ion-transport behavior in magnesium ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte membranes intended for magnesium batteries,"© 2021, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.In this paper, performance enhancement of magnesium ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte has been investigated with the incorporation of urea in it. The standard solution casting technique has been adopted to fabricate solid polymer electrolyte consisting of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) polymer, magnesium triflate (MgTf2) salt and urea. Measurement on conductivity, dielectric and modulus is carried out on the electrolyte films as a function of frequency at various temperatures. On the introduction of urea in PEO/MgTf2 matrix, the ionic conductivity improves by an order of magnitude and the relaxation time decreases from 0.45 to 0.16 µs. The highest conductivity of 6.3 × 10–5 S cm−1 has been recorded for PEO/MgTf2/Urea polymer electrolyte system. The ionic conductivity versus temperature plots suggests the Arrhenius behavior within the electrolyte compositions. The number density of the free ions increases by an order of magnitude from 1020 to 1021 on the addition of urea in PEO/MgTf2 matrix without any significant change in mobility values. The conductivity, dielectrics, surface morphology and X-ray diffraction studies reveal that urea is not only improving the porous structure but also interacting with the PEO/MgTf2 matrix to improve the ion dynamics. This approach toward improved ion-transport behavior may be utilized in fabricating high-performance electrolytes, especially for magnesium batteries.",Chemical Papers
Review on recent progress in Manganese-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The emerging sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries have drawn great attention as alternative means of energy storage because of their low cost and resource availability. However, designing electrode materials with outstanding performances and excellent cycling efficiency remains a significant obstacle because of the substantial mass and large radius of Na-ions. Because of their high theoretical specific capacity and low cost, manganese (Mn)-based materials have greater potential to be explored compared with other transition-metal oxide anodes. From their current state of the art, the utilisations of Mn-based anode materials, including MnO, MnO2, Mn2O3, Mn3O4, MnCo2O4, MnFe2O4 and MnS and their carbonaceous composites/oxides supported with different morphologies and compositions are still far from meeting the expected target of applications. Thus, comprehensive analyses and researches to tailor the interactions between the structural, morphology and electrochemical properties of the Mn-based anode materials are crucial to enable the success of the commercialisation of Na-ion batteries through material engineering strategies. In this review, we focus on the recent developments in Mn-based materials utilised as an anode for Na-ion batteries. The remaining problems along with the perspectives on the future development of this type of materials are also discussed.",International Journal of Energy Research
Sulfur encapsulation into yolk-shell Fe2N@nitrogen doped carbon for ambient-temperature sodium-sulfur battery cathode,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na-S) battery represents an advanced energy storage technology because of low cost and large theoretical energy density. However, RT-Na-S battery technology is facing severe challenges such as dissolution of sodium polysulfide, loss of active material on the surface of anode, serious shuttle effect and poor cycle stability. Herein, we synthesis hollow polar iron nitride nanoparticle encased N-doped carbon yolk shell (YS-Fe2N@NC) as sulfur carrier. The synergistic effect of YS-Fe2N@NC as well as wide void can be effectively trap polysulfides and improve the conductivity of sulfur-based cathode. The reversible reaction mechanism of Na-S battery is studied by in/ex-situ characterizations, catalytic behaviour of YS-Fe2N@NC and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The as made S/YS-Fe2N@NC composite exhibit promising specific capacity of 1123 mAh g−1 at the rate of 1C for the initial cycle, good rate capability (845 mAh g−1 at 2C) and ultra-stable cycling performance with an ultra-low capacity decay of 0.0724% per cycle.

Bimetallic nitride modified separator constructs internal electric field for high-performance lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2021Due to higher theoretical capacity and lower cost, the lithium-sulfur battery gradually replaces the traditional lithium-ion battery. Unfortunately, the shuttle effect of lithium-sulfur batteries is an important factor that hinders their marketization inputs. In this article, we propose an in-situ extrinsic metal etching strategy to activate inert single-metal nitrides through doping methods. The construction of the functional layer on the diaphragm results in an internal electric field directed to the negative electrode between the diaphragm and the negative electrode. The construction of the internal electric field is benefit for the moving of the anions and cations, thereby reducing the dissolution of the polysulfides. Moreover, it is found that the initial capacity reaches 1421 mAh g−1 and the utilization of sulfur reaches 84.83% at 0.1C. The initial capacity is 1280.8 mAh g−1, and there is 466.4 mAh g−1 specific capacity remaining after 1400 cycles and the decay rate is 0.045% at the rate of 1C. Even at the high rate of 5C, the initial capacity is 1097.2 mAh g−1 and the specific capacity of 379.4 mAh g−1 remains after 800 cycles.",Chemical Engineering Journal
An integrated strategy based on Schiff base reactions to construct unique two-dimensional nanostructures for intrinsic pseudocapacitive sodium/lithium storage,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Combining electrode materials with low-dimensional carbonaceous materials such as graphene is an effective way to improve the electrochemical performance of sodium/lithium-ion batteries (SIBs/LIBs). A common drawback of these recombinant hybrids is the weak interaction between the active component and graphene, resulting in poor structural stability and high resistance to diffusion of Na+/Li+ and electrons diffusing between phase boundaries during charging and discharging, thus leading to capacity decay and low rate capability of these hybrids. Here, a facile integrated construction strategy based on Schiff base reactions is developed to build a nitrogen and sulfur co-doped flexible lotus-leaf-like carbon and FeS nanosheets (FeS@N,S-CNSs). This structure takes full advantage of the high conductivity and mechanical flexibility of carbon nanosheets, and the high theoretical capacity of FeS. Together with the co-doping effects, the nanoscale size of FeS, and the robust connection between the in-situ generated FeS nanocrystals and carbon nanosheets, the FeS@N,S-CNSs outputs excellent electrochemical performance in both of SIBs and LIBs. Impressively, experimental results and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the charging/discharging process is essentially dominated by pseudocapacitive behavior, this intrinsic feature gives FeS@N,S-CNSs electrode exceptional rate capability (∼50% capacity retention even at 100 A g−1 in SIBs).",Chemical Engineering Journal
Recent Developments of Antimony-Based Anodes for Sodium- and Potassium-Ion Batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s).The development of sodium-ion (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) has increased rapidly because of the abundant resources and cost-effectiveness of Na and K. Antimony (Sb) plays an important role in SIBs and PIBs because of its high theoretical capacity, proper working voltage, and low cost. However, Sb-based anodes have the drawbacks of large volume changes and weak charge transfer during the charge and discharge processes, thus leading to poor cycling and rapid capacity decay. To address such drawbacks, many strategies and a variety of Sb-based materials have been developed in recent years. This review systematically introduces the recent research progress of a variety of Sb-based anodes for SIBs and PIBs from the perspective of composition selection, preparation technologies, structural characteristics, and energy storage behaviors. Moreover, corresponding examples are presented to illustrate the advantages or disadvantages of these anodes. Finally, we summarize the challenges of the development of Sb-based materials for Na/K-ion batteries and propose potential research directions for their further development.",Transactions of Tianjin University
Thermotolerant and fireproof gel polymer electrolyte toward high-performance and safe lithium-ion battery,"© 2021 Science PressPoly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and its derivatives based gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are severely limited in advanced and safe lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to the intrinsically high flammability of liquid electrolytes and PEO. Directly adding flame retardants to the GPEs can suppress their flammability and thus improve the safety of LIBs, but results in deteriorative electrochemical performance. Herein, a novel GPE with chemically bonded flame retardant (i.e. diethyl vinylphosphonate) in cross-linked polyethylene glycol diacrylate matrix, featuring both high-safety and high-performance, is designed. This as-prepared GPE storing the commercial 1 mol L−1 LiPF6 electrolyte resists high temperature of 200 °C and cannot be ignited as well as possesses a high ionic conductivity (0.60 mS cm−1) and good compatibility with lithium. Notably, the LiFePO4/Li battery with this GPE delivers a satisfactory capacity of 142.2 mA h g−1 and a superior cycling performance with a capacity retention of 96.3% and a coulombic efficiency of close to 100% for 350 cycles at 0.2 C under ambient temperature. Furthermore, the battery can achieve steady charge–discharge for 100 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 99.5% at 1 C under 80 °C and run normally even at a high temperature of 150 °C or under the exposure to butane flame. Differential scanning calorimetry manifests significantly improved battery safety compared to commercial battery systems. This work provides a new pathway for developing next-generation advanced LIBs with enhanced performance and high safety.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
One-Step Synthesis of Na-Sn Alloy with Internal 3D Na15Sn4Support for Fast and Stable Na Metal Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Na metal batteries are promising next-generation batteries but are constrained by the high reactivity of metallic Na. Here, we address this challenge by using a one-step-synthesized Na-Sn alloy anode with 1.6 at. % Sn. This anode has interconnected and sodiophilic Na15Sn4 backbones, which structurally support Na, enable faster Na+/Na redox kinetics, and guide dendrite-free Na plating with more stable solid-electrolyte interfaces. The composite Na@Na15Sn4 anode enabled very stable cycling of symmetric cells even at 5.0 mA cm-2 and improved the stability of full cells coupled with 3.0 mAh cm-2 Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes to >90% capacity retention for 300 cycles.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Diglyme-Incorporated Gelled Polymer: An Efficient Quasi-Solid-State Electrolyte for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Glyme-based electrolytes have been gaining increasing attention in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) for their attractive electrochemistry involving good complexation ability with Na-ions, high electrochemical stability, good transport characteristics, low volatility, and high safety. Here, we report a flexible and freestanding sodium-ion conducting gel polymer electrolyte containing an equimolar ratio of Na-salt NaTFSI and diglyme (G2), referred to as a solvate ionic liquid (SIL), immobilized inside host polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman analyses are employed to investigate the conformational evolutions in PVdF-HFP on incorporating G2 and NaTFSI, whereas structural changes are observed using X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical investigations on the electrolyte revealing a wide electrochemical stability window (∼5.2 V) versus Na/Na+, high room-temperature ionic conductivity (∼1.12 × 10-3 S cm-1), and a large Na+ transference number (tNa+ ∼0.58) along with thermal stability up to ∼100 °C render the electrolyte suitable for Na-storage applications. The Na deposition/extraction tests over a long period indicate excellent cyclic stability of the cells, revealing low and stable polarization with values limited to ±19 mV at a current density of 0.01 mA cm-2. Further, the prepared solvate ionic liquid-incorporated gel polymer electrolyte (SIL-GPE) is tested in Na-ion battery cells comprising Na0.7CoO2 cathode using galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling, with a first discharge capacity of ∼91.76 mA h g-1 at a 0.05C rate. Studies indicate a class of gel polymer electrolytes based on solvate ionic liquids, suitable for Na-storage applications.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
"One-pot solvothermal synthesis of mononuclear and oxalate-bridged binuclear nickel compounds: Structural analyses, conformation alteration and magnetic properties","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Two new discrete compounds with the formula [Ni(3,5,6-tcpa)(2,2′-bipy)Cl] (1) and [Ni2(3,5,6-tcpa)2(2,2′-bipy)2(ox)]·2EtOH (2) (3,5,6-Htcpa = 2-((3,5,6-trichloro pyridin-2-yl)oxy)acetic acid, 2,2′-bipy = 2,2′-bipyridine, ox = oxalate dianion) have been co-synthesized under solvothermal conditions in the same medium. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that both 1 and 2 have crystallized in triclinic system, space group P 1¯ and the central NiII ions are both in deformed square–pyramids. The NiII ion in 1 was bonded by one chloride ion (Cl-), one bidentate chelate 3,5,6-tcpa anion and one 2,2′-bipy to give a mononuclear complex 1. While for 2, the NiII ion was coodinated with one monodentate 3,5,6-tcpa, one oxalate anion and one 2,2′-bipy. The oxalate anion linked two equivalent NiII ions to form the binuclear cluster 2. The Cl···Cl halogen bonds, π···π stacking interactions and/or O[sbnd]H···O hydrogen bonds play an important part in the crystal packing for 1 and 2. Their deeply structural analyses revealed that the similar structure features and conformation alteration of 3,5,6-tcpa may be responsible for the cocrystallization phenomenon of 1 and 2. The magnetic measurements indicated the presence of intramolecular weak ferromagnetic coupling with J = 1.02 cm−1 in 2.",Inorganica Chimica Acta
A flame-retardant polyimide interlayer with polysulfide lithium traps and fast redox conversion towards safety and high sulfur utilization Li-S batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.In recent years and following the progress made in lithium-ion battery technology, substantial efforts have been devoted to developing practical lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries for next-generation commercial energy storage devices. The practical application of Li-S batteries is still limited by dramatically reduced capacities, cycling instabilities, and safety issues arising from flammable components. In this study, we designed and fabricated a flame-retardant, multifunctional interlayer which integrated electroconductive networks, lithium polysulfide (LiPS) traps and catalysts to significantly elevate the electrochemical performance and safety of pristine Li-S batteries. The LiPS adsorptive polymer polyimide (PI) constrains polysulfides to the cathode region and effectively suppresses the shuttle effect. Coralloid PI/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MCNT) compounds provide plentiful reaction sites for active materials. The catalytic Ni on the metal skeleton surface notably promotes Li+ diffusion, lowers the redox overpotential and accelerates LiPS conversion, which improves the redox kinetics associated with sulfur-related species and significantly elevates sulfur utilization. At different current densities of 0.2 C and 0.5 C, impressive initial discharge capacities of 1275.3 mA h g-1 and 1190.9 mA h g-1 are attainable respectively, with high capacity retentions of 80.3% and 78.6% over 600 cycles. Besides, the multifunctional interlayer can also act as a flame-retardant layer to promote the safety of Li-S batteries by inhibiting the spread of fire. This study provides a feasible and prospective strategy that adopts a multifunctional interlayer to develop Li-S batteries with higher capacities, longer cycling lives and safer working conditions.

Efficient production of hydrogen from H2S via electrolysis using a CoFeS2 catalyst,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryTransformation of noxious and undesirable industrial waste H2S into hydrogen (H2) via electrolysis will be a game-changing strategy. Herein, we have developed a cost-effective and highly stable nanorod embedded wheat grain CoFeS2 in conjugation with a nitrogen containing carbon framework for pure H2 production from H2S by reduction at the cathode and the sulfide oxidation reaction (SOR) at the anode. The proposed catalyst exhibits the lowest onset potential of 0.23 V vs. RHE to drive H2S electrolysis which is 1.0 V lower than the thermodynamic potential of electrochemical water splitting (1.23 V). Moreover, it demonstrates 97.8% H2 faradaic efficiency with remarkable durability up to 120 h.

Enhanced electrochemical performance enabled by ionic-liquid-coated Na3SbS4 electrolyte encapsulated in flexible filtration membrane,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Na3SbS4-based solid electrolytes show the merits of a high ionic conductivity and aqueous-processible syntheses. However, Na3SbS4 (NSS) is incompatible with metallic Na and Na alloys. Incorporation of an ionic liquid can solve this issue, but it is hard to coat it on sulfide powders homogeneously in a minimal quantity. Herein, a facile preparation is realized by using a PVDF filtration membrane with submicro-size vertical channels to constrain the flow of the liquid. By this constraint effect, the well mixed BMPTFSI and a NSS aqueous solution are soaked by the vertical channels and inhibited the segregation. Homogeneous BMPTFSI coating layers on NSS particles with a thickness less than 500 nm are encapsulated in the vertical channels after evaporating the water. The coating layers not only improve the physical contact of the NSS particles for enhanced ion transport, but more importantly effectively stabilize the interface between NSS and the metallic Na. The Na3V2(PO4)3||Na half cells with this composite electrolyte demonstrate superior cycling stability and good rate capability. This green method provides a facile way to optimize the interfacial performance for solid state batteries using ionic liquid.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Electrochemical characterization shows that the high performance is attributed to higher electronic conductivity of the coating, continuous compensation of the loss of LiF product through the coating, higher ionic conductivity of both the coating and the electrolyte, and higher stability of the electrolyte.",ACS Omega
Understanding the Oxidation and Reduction Reactions of Sulfur in Rechargeable Aluminum-Sulfur Batteries with Deep Eutectic Solvent and Ionic Liquid Electrolytes,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHAl-based batteries are promising next-generation rechargeable batteries owing to the abundance of raw materials and their high potential energy density. The Al−S system has attracted considerable attention because of its high energy density and low cost. However, its low discharge voltage plateau (0.6–1.2 V) hampers its practical application. Herein, eight ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents were studied as electrolyte candidates for an Al−S cell. This was the first study to demonstrate that an Al−S cell based on an AlCl3/acetamide electrolyte (1.3 molar ratio) showed high discharge voltage plateaus (1.65–1.95 V) and a charging cut-off voltage of 2.5 V in Al−S cells. An Al−S cell of 0.33 mAh capacity with the AlCl3/acetamide electrolyte successfully lit up a red LED (forward voltage 1.6–2.0 V) for around 2 h.

Iron Porphyrin Organic Frameworks Derived Bionic-Tree-Nodule-like Fe7S8with Ultralong Potassium Ion Storage,"© Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) serve as anodes for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) because of their high conductivity, high capacity, and requirement of cheap raw materials. However, their volume expansion, agglomeration, and crushing often lead to limited cycle life and inferior structural stability. Here, inspired by biological tree nodules, S, N-codoped carbon-coated Fe7S8 particles (Fe7S8@SNC) originated from metalloporphyrins and were rationally designed for PIBs after being vulcanized by a one-pot method. Fe7S8@SNC as an anode delivered a high reversible capacity of 410 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, an extremely long cycle up to 2000 cycles with a capacity of 214 mAh g-1 maintained at 1000 mA g-1, and excellent rate performances (287 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1 and 181 mAh g-1 at 2000 mA g-1). Significantly, ex situ TEM can still capture the stable structure of Fe7S8 after 500 cycles. In this unique structure, prominent Fe7S8 particles reduce the mechanical stress and shorten the transport path of K+, alleviating the pulverization during repeated insertion/extraction of K+. The S, N-codoped carbon decoration protects the structural stability and inhibits the agglomeration of internal Fe7S8, alleviates the volume change caused by the K+ reaction, and greatly improves the stability of PIBs. This study provides a new strategy for the realization of TMSs with ultralong cycling stability and lays a foundation for the commercial application of PIBs.",Energy and Fuels
Co-Intercalation Batteries (CoIBs): Role of TiS2 as Electrode for Storing Solvated Na Ions,"© 2022 The Authors. Advanced Energy Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.The co-intercalation of solvent molecules along with Na+ into the crystal lattice of electrode materials is an undesired process in sodium batteries. An exception is the intercalation of ether solvated alkali ions into graphite, a fast and highly reversible process. Here, reversible co-intercalation is shown to also be possible for other layered materials, namely titanium disulfide. Operando X-ray diffraction and dilatometry are used to demonstrate different storage mechanisms for different electrolyte solvents. Diglyme is found to co-intercalate into the TiS2 leading to a change in the voltage profile and an increase in the interlayer spacing (≈150%). This behavior is different compared to other solvents, which expand much less during Na storage (24% for tetrahydrofuran [THF] and for a carbonate mixture). For all solvents, specific capacities (2nd cycle) exceed 250 mAh g−1 whereas THF exhibited the best stability after 100 cycles. The solvent co-intercalation is rationalized by density functional theory and linked to the stability of the solvation shells, which is largest for diglyme. Finally, the TiS2 electrode with diglyme electrolyte is paired with a graphite electrode to realize the first proof-of-concept solvent co-intercalation battery, that is, a battery with two electrodes that both rely on reversible co-intercalation of solvent molecules.",Advanced Energy Materials
Opportunities of Flexible and Portable Electrochemical Devices for Energy Storage: Expanding the Spotlight onto Semi-solid/Solid Electrolytes,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The ever-increasing demand for flexible and portable electronics has stimulated research and development in building advanced electrochemical energy devices which are lightweight, ultrathin, small in size, bendable, foldable, knittable, wearable, and/or stretchable. In such flexible and portable devices, semi-solid/solid electrolytes besides anodes and cathodes are the necessary components determining the energy/power performances. By serving as the ion transport channels, such semi-solid/solid electrolytes may be beneficial to resolving the issues of leakage, electrode corrosion, and metal electrode dendrite growth. In this paper, the fundamentals of semi-solid/solid electrolytes (e.g., chemical composition, ionic conductivity, electrochemical window, mechanical strength, thermal stability, and other attractive features), the electrode-electrolyte interfacial properties, and their relationships with the performance of various energy devices (e.g., supercapacitors, secondary ion batteries, metal-sulfur batteries, and metal-air batteries) are comprehensively reviewed in terms of materials synthesis and/or characterization, functional mechanisms, and device assembling for performance validation. The most recent advancements in improving the performance of electrochemical energy devices are summarized with focuses on analyzing the existing technical challenges (e.g., solid electrolyte interphase formation, metal electrode dendrite growth, polysulfide shuttle issue, electrolyte instability in half-open battery structure) and the strategies for overcoming these challenges through modification of semi-solid/solid electrolyte materials. Several possible directions for future research and development are proposed for going beyond existing technological bottlenecks and achieving desirable flexible and portable electrochemical energy devices to fulfill their practical applications.

A smelting-rolling strategy for ZnIn bulk phase alloy anodes,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Reversibility and stability are considered as the key indicators for Zn metal anodes in aqueous Zn-ion batteries, yet they are severely hindered by uncontrolled Zn stripping/plating and side reactions. Herein, we fabricate a bulk phase ZnIn alloy anode containing trace indium by a typical smelting-rolling process. A uniformly dispersed bulk phase of the whole Zn anode is constructed rather than only a protective layer on the surface. The Zn deposition can be regarded as instantaneous nucleation due to the adsorption of the evenly dispersed indium, and formation of the exclusion zone for further nucleation can be prevented at the same time. Owing to the bulk phase structure of ZnIn alloy, the indium not only plays a crucial role in Zn deposition, but also improves the Zn stripping. Consequently, the as-designed ZnIn alloy anode can sustain stable Zn stripping/plating for over 2500 h at 4.4 mA cm−2 with nearly 6 times smaller voltage hysteresis than that of pure Zn. Moreover, it enables a substantially stable ZnIn//NH4V4O10 battery with 96.44% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1. This method of regulating the Zn nucleation by preparing a Zn-based alloy provides a potential solution to the critical problem of Zn dendrite growth and by-product generation fundamentally.",Chemical Science
3D Sodiophilic Ti3C2MXene@g-C3N4Hetero-Interphase Raises the Stability of Sodium Metal Anodes,"© Owing to several advantages of metallic sodium (Na), such as a relatively high theoretical capacity, low redox potential, wide availability, and low cost, Na metal batteries are being extensively studied, which are expected to play a major role in the fields of electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to utilizing MXene-based materials for suppressing Na dendrites, achieving a stable cycling of Na metal anodes remains extremely challenging due to, for example, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) caused by the severe side reactions. Herein, a g-C3N4 layer was attached in situ on the Ti3C2 MXene surface, inducing a surface state reconstruction and thus forming a stable hetero-interphase with excellent sodiophilicity between the MXene and g-C3N4 to inhibit side reactions and guide uniform Na ion flux. The 3D construction can not only lower the local current density to facilitate uniform Na plating/stripping but also mitigate volume change to stabilize the electrolyte/electrode interphase. Thus, the 3D Ti3C2 MXene@g-C3N4 nanocomposite enables much enhanced average CEs (99.9% at 1 mA h cm-2, 0.5 mA cm-2) in asymmetric half cells, long-term stability (up to 700 h) for symmetric cells, and stable cycling (up to 800 cycles at 2 C), together with outstanding rate capability (up to 20 C), of full cells. The present study demonstrates an approach in developing practically high performance for Na metal anodes.",ACS Nano
Aliovalent doping engineering enables multiple modulations of FeS2 anodes to achieve fast and durable sodium storage,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Metal sulfide anodes have trigged extensive academic progress in high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, their poor electronic conductivity and slack diffusion kinetics severely hinder their practical application. Herein, an efficient strategy to overcome the above-mentioned issues via heteroatom doping is proposed. As a demonstration, phosphorus-doped FeS2 nano-spindles encapsulated by a carbon layer (P-FeS2@C) are produced and investigated as an anode material for SIBs. As expected, the as-designed P-FeS2@C electrode presents a remarkably high specific capacity (624.4 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 after 100 cycles), admirable rate performance (401.2 mA h g−1 at 10.0 A g−1), and impressive cycling stability (285.4 mA h g−1 at 20.0 A g−1 over 4000 cycles). Furthermore, reaction kinetic analysis shows that the P-FeS2@C anode presents a high capacitive contribution ratio and large diffusion coefficient of Na+ during the sodium storage process compared with the undoped FeS2@C. Simultaneously, density functional theory validates that P doping ameliorates the electronic structure of FeS2 and induces the formation of a local built-in electric field around the doping sites, reducing the diffusion energy carriers of Na+ and accelerating the charge transport.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Trimodal hierarchical porous carbon nanorods enable high-performance Na-Se batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Technical bottlenecks of polyselenide shuttling and material volume variation significantly hamper the development of emerging sodium-selenium (Na-Se) batteries. The nanopore structure of substrate materials is demonstrated to play a vital role in stabilizing Se cathodes and approaching superior Na-ion storage properties. Herein, an ideal nanorod-like trimodal hierarchical porous carbon (THPC) host is fabricated through a facile one-step carbonization method for advanced Na-Se batteries. The THPC possesses a trimodal nanopore structure encompassing micropores, mesopores, and macropores, and functions as a good accommodator of Se molecules, a reservoir of polyselenide intermediates, a buffer for volume expansion of Se species during sodiation, and a promoter for electron/ion transfer in the electrochemical process. As a result, Na-Se batteries assembled with the Se-THPC composite cathode realize high utilization of Se, fast redox kinetics, and excellent cyclability. Furthermore, the Na-ion storage mechanism of the well-designed Se-THPC composite is profoundly revealed by in situ visual characterization techniques.",Chemical Science
Rational Design of an Artificial SEI: Alloy/Solid Electrolyte Hybrid Layer for a Highly Reversible Na and K Metal Anode,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.The practical application of a Na/K-metallic anode is intrinsically hindered by the poor cycle life and safety issues due to the unstable electrode/electrolyte interface and uncontrolled dendrite growth during cycling. Herein, we solve these issues through an in situ reaction of an oxyhalogenide (BiOCl) and Na to construct an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer consisting of an alloy (Na3Bi) and a solid electrolyte (Na3OCl) on the surface of the Na anode. As demonstrated by theoretical and experimental results, such an artificial SEI layer combines the synergistic properties of high ionic conductivity, electronic insulation, and interfacial stability, leading to uniform dendrite-free Na deposition beneath the hybrid SEI layer. The protected Na anode presents a low voltage polarization of 30 mV, achieving an extended cycling life of 700 h at 1 mA cm-2 in the carbonate-based electrolyte. The full cell based on the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode and hybrid SEI-protected Na anode shows long-term stability. When this strategy is applied to a K metal anode, the protected K anode also reaches a cycling life of over 4000 h at 0.5 mA cm-2 with a low voltage polarization of 100 mV. Our work provides an important insight into the design principles of a stable artificial SEI layer for high-energy-density metal batteries.",ACS Nano
Electrodeposited amorphous nickel–iron phosphide and sulfide derived films for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution,"© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCThe preparation of inexpensive and efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial in the widespread application of water electrolyzers. A simple one-step aqueous electrodeposition method is utilized to prepare amorphous nickel-iron sulfide (Ni–Fe–S) and phosphide (Ni–Fe–P) films on Ni foam. The deposited films are highly porous, and can convert to active electrocatalysts for OER. In 1 M KOH, the Ni–Fe–S shows the highest OER activity, and requires only 230 mV overpotential to reach 0.05 A cm−2 OER current densities. The Fe–Ni–S also sustains the 30 h 0.05 A cm−2 galvanostatic OER test. Ex-situ characterizations show that sulfur in the Fe–Ni–S is oxidized and leached into the solution during OER, and that (oxy)hydroxide layer is formed at the surface. The adsorption energy of the hydroxyl group, an OER intermediate, is tuned by the electron interaction between the Ni and Fe, and the Ni–Fe–S exhibits the optimum hydroxyl group adsorption energy and the most facile OER kinetics. Also, higher intrinsic OER activity is observed for the electrodeposited amorphous nickel phosphide-derived film than the amorphous nickel sulfide-derived film.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy

Binary Metal Single Atom Electrocatalysts with Synergistic Catalytic Activity toward High-Rate and High Areal-Capacity Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries with high theoretical energy density have been long considered as an alternative energy storage device to lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the polysulfide shuttle effects trigger fast capacity decay and short battery lifespan, severely hampering their practical utilizations. Herein, an efficient electrocatalyst comprising of nitrogen (N)-coordinated binary metal single atoms (SAs) implanted within a hierarchical porous carbon skeleton (Fe/Co-N-HPC) is constructed to trap and catalyze polysulfides conversion through a separator coating strategy. It is demonstrated that the introduction of Co atom can enrich the electron number of Fe active center, thereby realizing the distinct synergistic catalytic effect of binary metal SAs and improving the bidirectional catalysis of Li–S redox reaction. As a result, Li–S batteries with the Fe/Co-N-HPC-modified separator exhibit outstanding rate capability (740 mAh g−1 at 5.0 C), and superior long-term cyclic stability (694 mAh g−1 after 600 cycles at 1.0 C). Increasing the sulfur loading to 4.8 mg cm−2, a remarkable areal capacity of 6.13 mAh cm−2 is achieved. Furthermore, in situ X-ray diffraction and theoretical simulation results verify the catalysis mechanism of binary metal SAs by changing the rate-determining steps, providing new directions for constructing high-performance Li–S batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials

Sb particles embedded in N-doped carbon spheres wrapped by graphene for superior K+−Storing performances,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Antimony (Sb)-based nanocomposites have emerged as an attractive class of anode materials for potassium ion batteries as they exhibit large theoretical capacity and impressive working voltage. However, the tardy potassium ion diffusion characteristic, unstable Sb/electrolyte interphase, and huge volume variation pose a grand challenge that hinder the practical use of Sb-based anodes for potassium ion batteries.

MOFs-based nanomaterials for metal-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Rechargeable metal-sulfur batteries particularly Li-S batteries have gained huge interest over the last decades as one of the most promising alternatives to that of metal ion batteries. This is due to the high theoretical capacity of the sulfur (∼1675mAhg−1), abundance, and low cost. However, the sulfur cathodes encounter severe issues associated with its insulating nature, pulverization during charge discharge (80%), and more importantly the polysulfide shuttling, which causes huge irreversible capacity loss resulting in poor cycle stability. Thus, designing high-performance sulfur-based cathodes require a multifunctional host with high conductivity for charge transport and for high sulfur loading, high flexibility to buffer the structural strain during cycling, and multidentate interaction sites with polar polysulfides to prevent the polysulfide shuttling. Metal-organic frameworks a novel class of organic-inorganic hybrid materials and their derivatives, have shown promising features to act as multifunctional host for sulfur due to their unique characteristics like, high surface area for improving sulfur loading, high porosity to improve the electrode wetting, high conductivity to improve the sulfur utilization and charge transport and, tunable ligands and functionalities to hold polysulfides within cathode.

Assessment of ionic liquid electrolytes for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries using machine learning,"© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.To realize the full potential of the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, the shuttling of the polysulfide (PS) intermediates between the electrodes should be prevented. Moreover, inactive material mass in the battery pack should be minimized to increase the system-level energy density. In this respect, ionic liquids (IL) are getting increasing attention as they can reduce the PS shuttle mechanism with their limited PS solubility and functionality in lean electrolyte conditions. In this work, a dataset is constructed from the experimental literature data, which uses ILs as their electrolytes, to analyze the important cell variables and promising ILs for high cell- and system-level performances using association rule mining. The study reveals that with the help of ILs, high-performance cells with high sulfur loadings and low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratios can be attained. It is found that 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EMI_TFSI) or ionic liquids with the n-methyl-n-propylpyrrolidinium (P13) cation lead to higher cell capacities, whereas Li(tetraglyme) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li[G3]_TFSI) is found promising for high system-level energy densities. Highlights: Machine learning method of association rule mining is used to investigate the effect of critical materials and cell design factors on the performance of Li-S batteries using ionic liquid electrolytes. ARM was employed first for the experimental peak discharge capacity data and then for energy densities and specific energies predicted by a proposed system-level performance model. IL electrolytes show promising results in peak discharge capacities at high sulfur loadings and low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratios; however, their cycling performance at high C-rates needs to be improved.",International Journal of Energy Research

ChemElectroChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Sodium-ion batteries are promising candidates for post-lithium-ion batteries. While sodium has a less negative standard electrode potential compared to lithium, it is still a strong reducing agent. Ionic liquids are suitable solvents for sodium metal batteries, since metallic sodium is very reactive, particularly with water and molecules containing acidic hydrogen atoms.

All rights reserved.An in-situ nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon material was prepared via a simultaneous activation/carbonization process using biomass passiflora edulis peel and KHCO3 as carbon source and activator, respectively. The as-prepared porous carbon was composited with elemental sulfur to obtain the porous carbon/sulfur cathode material. The phase composition, microstructure, specific surface area, and pore structure of the as-prepared materials were investigated by these characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and so on. Also, the adsorption effect of polysulfides using porous carbon as an adsorbing material was studied by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances of porous carbon/sulfur composite cathodes with different sulfur content from 60% to 80% were studied by galvanostatic charge/discharge test. Results showed that the as-prepared material was amorphous porous carbon with a high specific surface area of 1 093 m2·g-1 and pore volume of 0.63 cm3·g-1. The physicochemical synergistic adsorption of polysulfides through abundant porous structure and in-situ nitrogen doping effectively suppresses the“shuttle effect”of lithium-sulfur batteries, whilst improving the discharge capacity and cycle performance. Consequently, the porous carbon/sulfur composite cathode with a sulfur content of 60% delivered high initial discharge capacities of 1 057.7 and 763.4 mAh·g-1 at 0.05C and 0.2C, respectively. At a high current rate of 1C, a long life of 300 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 75% can be achieved.",Chinese Journal of Inorganic Chemistry

Selective sulfur conversion with surface engineering of electrocatalysts in a lithium–sulfur battery,"© 2022 The Authors. Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.The sluggish kinetics of multiphase sulfur conversion with homogeneous and heterogeneous electrochemical processes, causing the “shuttle effect” of soluble polysulfide species (PSs), is the challenges in terms of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). In this paper, a Mn3O4−x catalyst, which has much higher activity for heterogeneous reactions than for homogeneous reactions (namely, preferential-activity catalysts), is designed by surface engineering with rational oxygen vacancies. Due to the rational design of the electronic structure, the Mn3O4−x catalyst prefers to accelerate the conversion of Li2S4 into Li2S2/Li2S and optimize Li2S deposition, reducing the accumulation of PSs and thus suppressing the “shuttle effect.” Both density functional theory calculations and in situ X-ray diffraction measurements are used to probe the catalytic mechanism and identify the reaction intermediates of MnS and LiyMnzO4−x for fundamental understanding. The cell with Mn3O4−x delivers an ultralow attenuation rate of 0.028% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 2.5 C. Even with sulfur loadings of 4.93 and 7.10 mg cm−2 in a lean electrolyte (8.4 µL mg s−1), the cell still shows an initial areal capacity of 7.3 mAh cm−2. This study may provide a new way to develop preferential-activity heterogeneous-reaction catalysts to suppress the “shuttle effect” of the soluble PSs generated during the redox process of LSBs.",Carbon Energy

Recently, engineering polysulfide redox catalysts (PSRCs) to stabilize and catalytically convert polysulfide intermediates is proposed as an effective strategy to address the grand challenge of “shuttle effects” in the cathode. Therefore, modulating the bond interactions and interface microenvironments and disclosing the structure–performance correlations between polysulfide and catalysts are essential to guide the future cathode design in MSBs.

Advances in understanding and regulation of sulfur conversion processes in metal-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have attracted intensive attention as promising next-generation energy storage systems, due to the high energy density and low cost of sulfur cathodes. Despite the substantial progress in improving LSBs’ performance, their wide implementation still suffers from great challenges, including the difficulties in achieving practically high energy density with long cycle life and the concerns about the limited lithium resources. The former issue mainly arises from the insufficient understanding of the mechanics of the complex lithium-sulfur redox reactions, while the latter trigger the exploration of a range of new metal-sulfur systems, such as sodium-sulfur, potassium-sulfur, magnesium-sulfur, calcium-sulfur, and aluminum-sulfur batteries. These lithium-free metal-sulfur batteries (MSBs) have the potential to offer higher energy density or/and lower battery costs. The fundamental understanding and rational regulation of effective metal-sulfur conversion reactions are crucial for developing advanced and emerging MSBs. Herein, this work aims to overview the state-of-the-art progress in circumventing these issues of MSBs, in terms of working mechanisms, key factors determining the electrochemical behavior and battery performance. Advanced in situ characterization techniques used to disclose the sulfur conversion mechanisms are also elaborately discussed.

Recent advanced development of stabilizing sodium metal anodes,"© 2022 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of SciencesAs the application of next-generation energy storage systems continues to expand, rechargeable secondary batteries with enhanced energy density and safety are imperative for energy iteration. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted extensive attention and are recognized as ideal candidates for large-scale energy storage due to the abundant sodium resources and low cost. Sodium metal anodes (SMAs) have been considered as one of the most attractive anode materials for SIBs owing to their high specific capacity (1166 mAh g−1), low redox potential, and abundant natural resources. However, the uncontrollable dendrite growth and inevitable side reactions on SMA lead to the continuous deterioration of the electrochemical performance, causing serious safety concerns and limiting their practical application in the future. Therefore, the construction of stable dendrite-free SMAs is a pressing problem for advanced sodium metal batteries (SMBs). In this review, we comprehensively summarize the research progress in suppressing the formation of sodium dendrite, including artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), liquid electrolyte modification, three-dimensional (3D) host materials, and solid-state electrolyte.

Double-Enhanced Core-Shell-Shell Sb2S3/Sb@TiO2@C Nanorod Composites for Lithium- and Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.For most alloying- and conversion-type anode materials, a huge volume expansion and structure degradation of the electrodes always hinder their applications. In this work, a novel core-shell-shell Sb2S3/Sb@TiO2@C nanorod composite has been designed layer by layer, which includes an inner Sb2S3/Sb heterostructure core protected by an oxygen-deficient TiO2 shell and a conductive carbon shell. It is interesting to observe that, during the carbothermic reduction process, the previous Sb2S3 nanorod cores are partially reduced into a metallic Sb phase and the reduced TiO2 also creates many oxygen vacancies, which can greatly enhance the conductivity of the semiconductor Sb2S3. Thanks to the double effects of the TiO2 middle shell and carbon outer shell, the unique double-shelled structure design creates an enhanced dual protection, which can better accommodate the volume-expansive deformation and preserve the structural integrity of the active Sb2S3/Sb core. Especially, the TiO2 middle layer is self-assembled by numerous nanoparticles acting as a nanopillar backbone, which supports between the nanorod core and outer carbon shell to better buffer the volume changes. As a result, the core-shell-shell Sb2S3/Sb@TiO2@C anode shows lithium and sodium storage performances superior to those of the pristine Sb2S3 and core-shell Sb2S3@TiO2 electrodes. For lithium-ion batteries, the Sb2S3/Sb@TiO2@C nanorod composite achieves an initial discharge/recharge capacity of 1244.9/1005.1 mAh g-1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of about 80.7%, an enhanced rate capability with a capacity of 593.2 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1, and prolonged cycling life for 500 cycles with a reversible capacity of 495.8 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1. For sodium-ion batteries, the nanorodalso exhibits an improved performance with an initial discharge/recharge capacity of 781.4/574.0 mAh g-1 (initial Coulombic efficiency of about 73.46%) and cycling for 400 cycles with a reversible capacity of 422.6 mAh g-1 at 0.8 A g-1. This research sheds light upon double-shell structure designs with an effective middle shell to enhance the energy storage performance of electrode materials.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Progress in the development of solid-state electrolytes for reversible room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Author(s).Proliferation in population with booming demand for viable energy storage solutions led to the exploration of storage technology beyond lithium-ion batteries. Sodium-sulfur batteries are potential candidates for post-lithium-ion energy storage courtesy of their high theoretical specific capacity and energy with lower material cost and abundance. However, their general consideration is significantly slowed down by the safety concerns, sodium polysulfide dissolution, and subsequent shuttling in liquid electrolytes, which negatively lower the electrochemical performance and shorten the cycle life. Room-temperature solid-state sodium-sulfur batteries with high electrochemical performances and enhanced safety are excellent analogs based on leakage-free modified electrolytes. However, developments in solid-state electrolytes are in their infancy, with issues such as lower ionic conduction, interfacial instability, and lower capacity retention. This review summarizes developments in room-temperature solid-state sodium-sulfur batteries, focusing on various methods to improve ionic conduction while ensuring interfacial stability and enhancing the overall electrochemical properties. From a combined physico-electro-chemical approach, bifurcation based on the electrolyte material, classified as an inorganic and organic solid polymer electrolyte, has been discussed with its merits and demerits.

Batteries & Supercaps published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Among ‘beyond lithium ion’ energy storage, lithium sulfur (Li−S) batteries are one of the most promising technologies, as a result of the potential for high theoretical energy capacity at low cost.

Carbonyl-based organic salt-disodium rhodizonate (Na2C6O6) with high theoretical specific capacity (501 mAh·g−1) is considered as a promising cathode material for SIBs. However, the dissolution of active material in electrolyte and low electronic conductivity lead to rapidly capacity decay and poor rate performance. Herein, a simple method is designed to construct free-standing and flexible Ti3C2Tx Na2C6O6/MXene paper via vacuum-assisted filtration and antisolvent approach. The MXene can form an electronic conductive network, adsorb the active materials, and offer additional active sites for Na storage.

Synthesis and electrochemical properties of nickel sulfide/carbon composite as anode material for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries,"© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Transition metal sulfides have been considered a novel anode material for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). However, their practical applications have been limited by their relatively poor cyclic stabilities and low rate performances. This work synthesized carbon-coated nickel sulfide (NiS) composites with a core-shell structure for high-performance LIBs and SIBs by a solvothermal method. The one-step synthesis of nickel sulfide and carbon at a low temperature can affect the thin homogeneous carbon coating, the buffer volume, and the sulfur dissolution of NiS nanoparticles. Due to small particle size dominance, desirable structural flexibility, and core-shell architecture, the as-prepared nickel sulfide/carbon composites showed substantial enhancement in LIBs and SIBs. The nickel sulfide/carbon composite electrodes displayed a high reversible discharge capacity of around 500 and 360 mAh/g after 50 cycles for LIBs and SIBs. The prepared NiS anode materials deliver the enormous potential for developing huge lithium/sodium storage.",International Journal of Energy Research
Atomic-Scale Insights into Comparative Mechanisms and Kinetics of Na-S and Li-S Batteries,"© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The Na-S and Li-S batteries are in the forefront to supplant ubiquitously used lithium-ion batteries. The understanding of mechanistic differences between Na-S and Li-S is critical to enable the inter-transfer of developed technologies toward designing high-performance cathode materials. The anchoring materials (AMs) are required to overcome the performance-limiting factors such as sluggish kinetics of metal polysulfides' (M2Sn, M = Na and Li, n = 1-8) conversion reactions and their dissolution into electrolytes. This study undertakes the challenges to critically understand the role of AMs on the polysulfide chemistry in both the batteries. We employ first-principles density functional theory simulations to comprehensively examine the adsorption mechanisms of M2Sn and the kinetics of sulfur reduction reactions (SRRs) and the catalytic decomposition of short-chain polysulfides across Na-S and Li-S batteries on pristine and vanadium (V) single-atom catalyst embedded WSe2 (V@WSe2) substrates. We found that pristine WSe2 cannot immobilize the higher-order M2Sn; however, V@WSe2 endows adequate binding energies to trap the higher-order M2Sn. The degree of M2Sn adsorption strengths and the effectiveness of the V@WSe2 varies between Na-S and Li-S systems. We elucidate the underlying mechanistic details with the aid of charge transfer, bond strength, and density of state analysis. Importantly, our simulations reveal that, in V@WSe2, the rate-limiting step of the SRR is kinetically faster in Li-S, whereas the oxidative decomposition of the discharge end product M2S exhibits accelerated kinetics in Na-S batteries. These findings are pivotal to understand the role of AMs in the design of cathode materials for addressing the performance-limiting factors in Na-S and Li-S batteries, in particular, and metal-sulfur batteries, in general.",ACS Catalysis

Herein, we report a vacancy engineering strategy for preparing a class of Te-doped 1T’-ReSe2 anchored onto MXene (Te-ReSe2/MXene) as an advanced anode for KIBs with high performance. By taking advantage of the synergistic effects of the defective Te-ReSe2 arrays with expanded interlayers and the elastic MXene nanosheets with self-autoadjustable function, the Te-ReSe2/MXene superstructure exhibits boosted K+ ion storage performance, in terms of high reversible capacity (361.1 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 over 200 cycles), excellent rate capability (179.3 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1), ultra-long cycle life (202.8 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 over 2000 cycles), and steady operation in flexible full battery, presenting one of the best performances among the TMDs-based anodes reported thus far. The kinetics analysis and theoretical calculations further indicate that satisfactory pseudocapacitive property, high electronic conductivity and outstanding K+ ion adsorption/diffusion capability corroborate the accelerated reaction kinetics. Especially, structural characterizations clearly elaborate that the Te-ReSe2/MXene undergoes reversible evolutions of an initial insertion process followed by a conversion reaction.",Science China Materials

Among various polymer hosts, developed so far, polycaprolactone (PCL) is attractive for its biodegradable and biocompatible nature. In this report, we demonstrate a novel GPE composition incorporating a liquid electrolyte 1 M sodium triflurosulfonate (NaTf) in ethylene carbonate (EC):propylene carbonate (PC) mixture, immobilized in PCL as the host polymer in the form of mechanically stable, free-standing and flexible thick films.

Enhanced interphasial stability of hard carbon for sodium-ion battery via film-forming electrolyte additive,"© 2022, Tsinghua University Press.Although the operating mechanism of sodium-ion battery (SIB) resembles that of lithium-ion battery, common film-forming additive for lithium-ion battery does not play its role in SIB. Therefore, it is essential to tailor new additives for SIB. Hard carbon (HC), as the most used anode material of SIB, has the disadvantage of interphasial instability, especially under the condition of long-term cycling. The incessant accumulation of electrolyte decomposition products leads to a significant increase in interphasial impedance and a sharp decline in discharge capacity. In this work, N-phenyl-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) (PTFSI) was proposed as a novel film-forming electrolyte additive, which effectively enhances the long-term cycling performance for HC anode in SIB. The passivation film generated from the preferential reduction of PTFSI improves the capacity retention of HC/Na half-cell from 0% to 68% after 500 cycles. Profoundly, the enhanced interphasial stability of HC anode results in a 52% increase in capacity retention of HC/Na3V2(PO4)3 full-cells after 100 cycles.

Soluble Electrolyte-Coordinated Sulfide Species Revealed in Al-S Batteries by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,"© 2022 American Chemical Society.Rechargeable aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) batteries have recently garnered significant interest to the low cost, earth abundance, safety, and high theoretical capacity of the electrode materials. However, Al-S batteries exhibit many challenges that plague other metal-sulfur battery systems, including significant capacity fade of the sulfur electrode due to the formation of electrolyte-soluble reaction intermediates. Here, Al-S cells using chloroaluminate-containing ionic liquid electrolytes were investigated up from the molecular level using multidimensional solid-state 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical measurements. Solid-state 27Al single-pulse NMR measurements acquired on cycled sulfur electrodes containing electrolyte-soaked separator revealed multiple discharge products, which were distinguished into liquid- and solid-phase products based on 27Al chemical exchange and nutation NMR experiments. During discharge, electrolyte-soluble sulfide species form that coordinate with the AlCl4- chloroaluminate anions, resulting in (SxAlCl4)y- electrolyte complexes. These electrolyte-coordinated sulfide species persist upon charge, resulting in the loss of active mass that explains the significant capacity fade observed upon galvanostatic cycling. XPS, XRD, and solid-state 27Al NMR measurements reveal that solid amorphous Al2S3 forms reversibly upon discharge. The results highlight the technological importance of understanding how electrolyte-soluble sulfide species coordinate with the complex electroactive species used in multivalent metal-sulfur batteries, which can affect their reversibility and electrochemical properties.",Chemistry of Materials

However, their commercial viability is seriously challenged by serious polysulfide shuttle effect, sluggish sulfur kinetics, and uncontrollable dendritic Li growth. Herein, a dual-functional electrolyte additive, diphenyl ditelluride (DPDTe) is reported for Li–S battery. For sulfur cathodes, DPDTe works as a redox mediator to accelerate redox kinetics of sulfur, in which Te radical-mediated catalytic cycle at the solid–liquid interface contributes significantly to the whole process. For lithium anodes, DPDTe can react with lithium metal to form a smooth and stable organic–inorganic hybrid solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), enabling homogeneous lithium deposition for suppressing dendrite growth. Consequently, the Li–S battery with DPDTe exhibits remarkable cycling stability and superb rate capability, with a high capacity up to 1227.3 mAh g−1 and stable cycling over 300 cycles. Moreover, a Li–S pouch cell with DPDTe is evaluated as the proof of concept.

Sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Rechargeable sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries are regarded as a promising alternative for lithium-ion batteries due to high energy density and low cost. Although high-temperature (HT) Na-S batteries with molten electrodes and a solid beta-alumina electrolyte have been commercially used for large-scale energy storage, their high working temperature (300-350°C) increases operating cost and causes safety concerns. In recent years, increasing research attention has been devoted to developing room temperature (RT) Na-S batteries with higher capacity, lower maintenance cost, and improved safety. Herein, the working principles and the advances in the battery components including cathode, anode, electrolyte, and cell configuration of RT Na-S batteries are summarized in this chapter.",Storing Energy: with Special Reference to Renewable Energy Sources
A novel molecular synthesis route to Li2S loaded carbon fibers for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The synthesis of a novel air-stable molecular precursor (LiSC2H4)2NMe enables the formation of the desired 1D lithium sulfide (Li2S) via the electrospinning method under ambient conditions. The solubility of the precursor in polar solvents combined with a common polymer (PVP) allowed a suitable spinning solution to obtain ideal green Li2S loaded fibers. 3D fiber mats of the calcined homogeneous 1D electrospun Li2S/C fibers were characterized by electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction analysis. Direct integration of Li2S in an electronically conductive carbon matrix as the cathode obviates the need of elemental lithium as the anode, which is a great advantage against the reported lithium-sulfur batteries. An initial capacity of about 870 mA h g−1 at C/20, a capacity retention of 73% after 100 cycles at C/10 and a capacity of about 400 mA h g−1 at 1C were observed for the presented system.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
"Affinity-Engineered Flexible Scaffold toward Energy-Dense, Highly Reversible Na Metal Batteries","© 2022 Zhengzhou University.The practical deployment of metallic anodes in the energy-dense batteries is impeded by the thermodynamically unstable interphase in contact with the aprotic electrolyte, structural collapse of the substrates as well as their insufficient affinity toward the metallic deposits. Herein, the mechanical flexible, lightweight (1.2 mg cm−2) carbon nanofiber scaffold with the monodispersed, ultrafine Sn4P3 nanoparticles encapsulation (Sn4P3NPs@CNF) is proposed as the deposition substrate toward the high-areal-capacity sodium loadings up to 4 mAh cm−2. First-principles calculations manifest that the alloy intermediates, namely the Na15Sn4 and Na3P matrix, exhibit the intimate Na affinity as the “sodiophilic” sites. Meanwhile, the porous CNF regulates the heterogeneous alloying process and confines the deposit propagation along the nanofiber orientation. With the precise control of pairing mode with the NaVPO4F cathode (8.7 mg cm−2), the practical feasibility of the Sn4P3 NPs@CNF anode (1* Na excess) is demonstrated in 2 mAh single-layer pouch cell prototype, which achieves the 95.7% capacity retention for 150 cycles at various mechanical flexing states as well as balanced energy/power densities.",Energy and Environmental Materials
Ion dynamics in PEO/PVP blend added with sodium triflouromethane sulphonate,"© 2021The solid polymer electrolyte membranes are required to fabricate safe and low-cost sodium batteries. This paper reports ion-dynamics studies on solid polymer electrolyte consisting of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as polymer blend and sodium triflate (NaCF3SO3) as sodium ion conducting salt. The solid polymer electrolytes PEO/PVP/NaCF3SO3 have been prepared using solution cast techniques. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been utilized to study the role of incorporating NaCF3SO3 in varying amounts within PEO/PVP polymer blend. The optimized solid polymer electrolyte with 10 wt% NaCF3SO3 salt reports an ionic conductivity of 2.2 × 10-9 Scm−1 at room temperature. The ionic conductivity versus frequency plots indicates an increase in ionic conductivity values as the frequency increases. In order to explore the ion-dynamics the dielectric and modulus formulation has been adopted. The dielectric constant plots indicate polarizing effects at low frequencies and tangent loss curves shows presence of a relaxation peak. The frequency and relaxation time corresponding to the relaxation peak for optimized solid polymer electrolyte gives relaxation time of 2.69 × 10-3 s, charge carrier density of 1.18 × 1012 cm−3 and mobility of 0.01169 cm2 V−1 s−1.

Cellulose nanofiber-derived carbon aerogel for advanced room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022 The Authors. Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT/Na–S) batteries are regarded as promising large-scale stationary energy storage systems owing to their high energy density and low cost as well as the earth-abundant reserves of sodium and sulfur. However, the diffusion of polysulfides and sluggish kinetics of conversion reactions are still major challenges for their application. Herein, we developed a powerful and functional separator to inhibit the shuttle effect by coating a lightweight three-dimensional cellulose nanofiber-derived carbon aerogel on a glass fiber separator (denoted NSCA@GF). The hierarchical porous structures, favorable electronic conductivity, and three-dimensional interconnected network of N,S-codoped carbon aerogel endow a multifunctional separator with strong polysulfide anchoring capability and fast reaction kinetics of polysulfide conversion, which can act as the barrier layer and an expanded current collector to increase sulfur utilization. Moreover, the hetero-doped N/S sites are believed to strengthen polysulfide anchoring capability via chemisorption and accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion, which is confirmed from experimental and theoretical results. As a result, the assembled Na–S coin cells with the NSCA@GF separator showed a high reversible capacity (788.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C after 100 cycles) and superior cycling stability (only 0.059% capacity decay per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C), thereby demonstrating the significant potential for application in high-performance RT/Na–S batteries.",Carbon Energy

The Na-CO2 battery made with cheap alkali metal sodium and greenhouse gas CO2 is an effective strategy to consume CO2 and store clean renewable energy. However, the liquid electrolyte volatilization in the open battery system and inevitable dendrite growth restrict the application of Na-CO2 batteries. In this work, magnesium-doped Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) was studied as a solid electrolyte for solid-state Na-CO2 batteries. The ionic conductivity of Na3.2Zr1.9Mg0.1Si2PO12 reaches 1.16 mS cm−1 at room temperature by replacing Zr ions in Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with Mg ions, and the structural changes are analyzed by neutron powder diffraction.

Tuning active sites of N-doped porous carbon catalysts derived from vinasse for high-performance electrochemical sensing,"© 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.N-doped biomass-derived porous carbon was synthesized by the pyrolysis of sugarcane-vinasse to develop a novel metal-free catalyst in electrochemical sensing. Vinasse samples were subjected to different pyrolysis temperatures under nitrogen flow to investigate the effect of the pyrolysis temperature on the physical properties of the biomass-derived products. The XPS results displayed that as-pyrolyzed samples contain N atoms with an atomic ratio of 3.02%. While a low surface area of 1.5 m2/g was measured from the sample pyrolyzed at 600 °C, the increase in the temperature yielded a large surface area of 620 m2/g. Additional heat treatment was implemented to tailor N-binding sites. Samples were then used as electroactive catalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrochemical sensing.

Key to intimately coupling metal chalcogenides with a carbon nanonetwork for potassium-ion storage,"© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryIntimately coupling metal chalcogenides (MCs) with carbon materials is critical for boosting their application performances. However, since MCs and carbon materials are usually two types of incompatible materials, a non-uniform carbon/MC interface is easily formed, especially for multidimensional nanostructures. Herein, we propose an interfacial engineering strategy to enhance the interaction between a three-dimensional nanonetwork-structured carbon aerogel (CA) and MCs. The key to this strategy is the introduction of substantial oxygen-containing functional groups into the CA, which greatly improves its compatibility with MC precursors, and thus enables MCs to grow on the CA framework homogeneously. The optimized CA/MC interface enables extremely compact bonding interaction between the CA and MC nanosheets. Benefitting from a well-organized structure, the synthesized CA@MC composites show remarkable potassium-ion storage performances and electrochemical kinetic properties. As a demonstration, the CA@MoS2 composites show high reversible capacity (389 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1), excellent rate performance (capacity retention exceeds 40% with a 5-fold increase of the current density) and an enhanced ion diffusion rate when used as an anode material for potassium-ion batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Challenge and Strategies in Room Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries: A Comparison with Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Metal–sulfur batteries exhibit great potential as next-generation rechargeable batteries due to the low sulfur cost and high theoretical energy density.

Higher earth abundance, similar electrochemistry as lithium, and cost-effectiveness have driven the research focused on building better SIBs. Solid inorganic and polymer electrolytes (PEs) are prevailing electrolyte candidates for SIBs. The bottleneck of both the electrolytes, such as low ionic conductivity, poor mechanical and thermal stability, and high interfacial charge resistance, has retarded the rate of their commercial acceptance for futuristic energy devices. To tackle these burning issues, strategies to couple inorganic and polymer electrolytes as composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) are drawing immense interest in academia and industry. The present review discusses the state-of-the-art composite polymer electrolytes for SIBs. It comprises three parts. The first part briefs about the introduction and performance index of CPEs to assess the importance of CPEs over existing electrolytes. In the second part, various synthesis methods for CPEs preparations are encapsulated. The third part is focused on the role of extrinsic fillers (active and passive) and the corresponding mechanism involved in ionic transport in CPEs by recently reported works. The role of filler engineering in addressing the remedies of CPEs is also intensely scrutinized. Finally, this review is concluded with the perspective of CPEs toward the future of SIB development.

Robust Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries Enabled by a Sandwich-Structured MXene@C/Polyolefin/MXene@C Dual-functional Separator,"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na-S) batteries are attracting increased attention due to their high theoretical energy density and low-cost. However, the traditional RT-Na-S batteries assembled with glass fiber (GF) separators are still hindered by the polysulfide shuttle effect and sodium dendrite growth, limiting the battery's capacity and cycling stability. Here, a facile and effective method toward commercial polyolefin separators for constructing stable RT-Na-S batteries is presented. By coating commercial polypropylene membrane with core-shell structured MXene@C nanosheets, a powerful dual-functional separator with improved electrolyte wettability that can inhibit polysulfide migration and induce uniform sodium disposition is developed. More importantly, the modified separator can also accelerate the conversion kinetics of sodium polysulfides. Benefiting from these characteristics, the as-prepared RT-Na-S battery exhibits a remarkably enhanced capacity (1159 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C) and excellent cycling performance (95.8% of capacity retention after 650 cycles at 0.5 C).

Modification of NASICON Electrolyte and Its Application in Real Na-Ion Cells,"© 2021 THE AUTHORSThe low ionic conductivity of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) and the inferior interfacial reliability between SSEs and solid-state electrodes are two urgent challenges hindering the application of solid-state sodium batteries (SSSBs). Herein, sodium (Na) super ionic conductor (NASICON)-type SSEs with a nominal composition of Na3+2xZr2–xMgxSi2PO12 were synthesized using a facile two-step solid-state method, among which Na3.3Zr1.85Mg0.15Si2PO12 (x = 0.15, NZSP-Mg0.15) showed the highest ionic conductivity of 3.54 mS∙cm−1 at 25 °C. By means of a thorough investigation, it was verified that the composition of the grain boundary plays a crucial role in determining the total ionic conductivity of NASICON. Furthermore, due to a lack of examination in the literature regarding whether NASICON can provide enough anodic electrochemical stability to enable high-voltage SSSBs, we first adopted a high-voltage Na3(VOPO4)2F (NVOPF) cathode to verify its compatibility with the optimized NZSP-Mg0.15 SSE. By comparing the electrochemical performance of cells with different configurations (low-voltage cathode vs high-voltage cathode, liquid electrolytes vs SSEs), along with an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy evaluation of the after-cycled NZSP-Mg0.15, it was demonstrated that the NASICON SSEs are not stable enough under high voltage, suggesting the importance of investigating the interface between the NASICON SSEs and high-voltage cathodes. Furthermore, by coating NZSP-Mg0.15 NASICON powder onto a polyethylene (PE) separator (PE@NASICON), a 2.42 A∙h non-aqueous Na-ion cell of carbon|PE@NASICON|NaNi2/9Cu1/9Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 was found to deliver an excellent cycling performance with an 88% capacity retention after 2000 cycles, thereby demonstrating the high reliability of SSEs with NASICON-coated separator.",Engineering
Elution of Sulfuric Compounds from Na-sulfide Waste for Stable Management at a Disposal Site: an Experimental Investigation,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.We investigated the dissolution and oxidation behaviors of sulfuric waste from secondary batteries by reacting the waste with synthetic rainwater to examine the optimal management of this waste at a disposal site. Morphological observation and chemical analysis of bulk sulfur (S) wastes revealed heterogeneous distributions of sodium sulfide (NaS) and thiosulfate (Na2S2O3). Leaching experiments using crushed S-waste samples with oxygenated synthetic rainwater for 144 h showed that sulfide ion was the dominant eluent from the less-oxidized sample, whereas sulfate (SO4) and S2O3 ions were released from the well-oxidized sample (left for 6 months). An atmospheric oxidation experiment of S-waste was carried out to elucidate the relationship between sulfide oxidation on the S-waste surface and eluted species. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed rapid oxidation of NaS to Na2S2O3 within the first 72 h, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry revealed that the sulfide-oligomers species (S3 and S4) formed after reaction for 336 h. The kinetic analysis indicates that NaS was easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. The oxidation rate was 10–100 times higher than that of pyrite. The NaS oxidation and the formation of sulfide oligomer species inhibited the rapid dissolution of sulfuric components from a well-oxidized sample. Most S-waste could be exposed to atmospheric air before disposal; therefore, the main concern for this waste disposal could be SO4 and S2O3 ion dissolution and interaction (redissolution) with toxic compounds such as enhancement of leaching rate of heavy metals due to complex ion formulation.","Water, Air, and Soil Pollution"
The Effect of Sulfated Zirconia and Zirconium Phosphate Nanocomposite Membranes on Fuel-Cell Efficiency,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.To investigate the effect of acidic nanoparticles on proton conductivity, permeability, and fuel-cell performance, a commercial Nafion® 117 membrane was impregnated with zirconium phosphates (ZrP) and sulfated zirconium (S-ZrO2 ) nanoparticles. As they are more stable than other solid superacids, sulfated metal oxides have been the subject of intensive research. Meanwhile, hydrophilic, proton-conducting inorganic acids such as zirconium phosphate (ZrP) have been used to modify the Nafion® membrane due to their hydrophilic nature, proton-conducting material, very low toxicity, low cost, and stability in a hydrogen/oxygen atmosphere. A tensile test, water uptake, methanol crossover, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to assess the capacity of nanocomposite membranes to function in a fuel cell. The modified Nafion® membrane had a higher water uptake and a lower water content angle than the commercial Nafion® 117 membrane, indicating that it has a greater impact on conductivity. Under strain rates of 40, 30, and 20 mm/min, the nanocomposite membranes demonstrated more stable thermal deterioration and higher mechanical strength, which offers tremendous promise for fuel-cell applications. When compared to 0.113 S/cm and 0.013 S/cm, respectively, of commercial Nafion® 117 and Nafion® ZrP membranes, the modified Nafion® membrane with ammonia sulphate acid had the highest proton conductivity of 7.891 S/cm.

MXenes@Te as a composite material for high-performance aluminum batteries MXenes@Te作为高性能铝电池复合正极材料,"© 2021, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials, MXenes, play an important role in various fields of energy storage and exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. Herein, we prepared few-layered MXenes (F-Ti3C2Tx) and loaded Te on the surface of F-Ti3C2Tx by using a simple high-temperature evaporation method. In addition, the electrochemical performance of the aluminum battery with F-Ti3C2Tx as support material was studied. The initial charge/discharge specific capacities are 987/1096 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. An obvious discharge voltage plateau of about 1.3 V appears at various current densities. The specific capacity is about 258 mA h g−1 with MXenes@Te as the active material in the aluminum battery, which benefits from the excellent electronic conductivity of the MXenes and their 2D layered structure. Density functional theory calculations were carried out to explore the mechanism. Ti3C2O2@Te is more inclined to adsorb [AlCl4]− than Ti3C2O2. Furthermore, the valence change behavior of element Te was studied by using thermodynamic calculation (FactSage 7.1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that when the battery is fully charged to 2.4 V element Te and Ti ions (Ti3+, Ti2+) are oxidized to Te4+ and Ti4+. In contrast to the charging process, the high-valence Te4+ and Ti4+ are reduced again during discharging. Element Te is reduced to lower-valence Te2− when the discharge voltage is lower than 0.6 V, and a higher charge voltage (2.56 V) is required for Te to be oxidized to Te6+.",Science China Materials
Characterizing the Chemical Structure of Ti3C2Tx MXene by Angle-Resolved XPS Combined with Argon Ion Etching,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Angle-resolved XPS combined with argon ion etching was used to characterize the surface functional groups and the chemical structure of Ti3C2Tx MXene. Survey scanning obtained on the sample surface showed that the sample mainly contains C, O, Ti and F elements, and a little Al element. Analyzing the angle-resolved narrow scanning of these elements indicated that a layer of C and O atoms was adsorbed on the top surface of the sample, and there were many O or F related Ti bonds except Ti–C bond. XPS results obtained after argon ion etching indicated staggered distribution between C–Ti–C bond and O–Ti–C, F–Ti bond. It is confirmed that Ti atoms and C atoms were at the center layer of Ti3C2Tx MXene, while O atoms and F atoms were located at both the upper and lower surface of Ti3C2 layer acting as surface functional groups. The surface functional groups on the Ti3C2 layer were determined to include O2−, OH−, F− and O−–F−, among which F atoms could also desorb from Ti3C2Tx MXene easily. The schematic atomic structure of Ti3C2Tx MXene was derived from the analysis of XPS results, being consistent with theoretical chemical structure and other experimental reports. The results showed that angle-resolved XPS combing with argon ion etching is a good way to analysis 2D thin layer materials.",Materials

The porous P,N-doped C skeleton not only facilitates the ion transport and penetration of electrolyte, but also alleviates the volume expansion and agglomeration of SiOx particles. The P and N co-doping can generate additional defective sites on the C matrix surface, which enhances electronic conductivity and energy storage performance. Due to the above advantages, the optimized PN@C/SiOx composite as anode of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) presents an excellent reversible specific capacity of 1078 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and improved initial coulombic efficiency (CE) of 73.6%. Even at 1.0 A/g, a steady specific capacity of 622 mAh/g still could be achieved after 1000 cycles. It is believed that this strategy has great potential in large-scale production of new energy materials for future practical applications.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
An experimental investigation of cylindrical shaped thermal storage unit consisting of phase change material based helical coil heat exchanger,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdPhase change materials (PCMs) have an enormous potential to store energy in the form of latent heat. The organic phase materials show more efficiency and stability in charging and discharging activities. The present work details an experimental investigation of a thermal storage unit consisting of a PCM-based helical coil heat exchanger with winded copper wires. The experimental investigation of PCM-based helical heat exchanger shows that the PCM maximum charging time in PCM-based helical coil heat exchanger for the flow rate of 15.83 ml/s, 20.00 ml/s, and 33.33 ml/s are recorded as 1370, 1290, and 1090 s, respectively. The discharging time of PCM in PCM based helical coil at top helix from 39.90 °C to 35.90 °C is 11090s while the discharging time for PCM at bottom helix from 38.93 °C to 35.92 °C is also 11,010 s. The discharging time of tap water with a PCM-based helical coil heat exchanger is found to be 12,480 s while discharging time of tap water for a simple helical coil heat exchanger is found to be 7210 s. Also, the instantaneous effectiveness of the thermal storage unit for the flow rate of 33.33 ml/s changes between 0.6023 to 0.4012. This study shows that the instantaneous effectiveness of thermal storage units is maximum for low flow rate while the minimum for higher flow rate.",Journal of Energy Storage
Gamma radiation-induced crosslinking of Ca2+ loaded poly(acrylic acid) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate networks for polymer gel electrolytes,"© 2021 The Author(s)Gel electrolytes based on poly(acrylic acid) and poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate (PAA-PEGDA-Ca2+) loaded with Ca2+ ions were successfully prepared using gamma irradiation. The use of radiation provides benefits, such as solventless preparation without byproducts. The obtained gel fraction, porosity, and swelling ratio were in the range of 60–90%, 11–60%, and 4–12 g/g, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the successful crosslinking between PAA and PEGDA. Crystallinity remained unaffected by the incorporation of Ca2+ ions. The thermal decomposition of the gels started at 200°C. The morphology was reported to have a spherical shape. 0.36–0.74 wt.% of Ca2+ was uniformly distributed on the gel electrolyte surface. In the presence of Ca2+ ions, the ionic conductivity of the gels improved by ∼2 times, whereas compressive strength slightly dropped to the range of 6–12 MPa.

Bench-scale demonstration of thermochemical energy storage using the Magnesium-Manganese-Oxide redox system,"© 2021 The AuthorsLow-cost, large-scale energy storage for 10 to 100 h is a key enabler for transitioning to a carbon neutral power grid dominated by intermittent renewable generation via wind and solar energy. High temperature thermochemical Magnesium-Manganese-Oxide (Mg-Mn-O) redox storage in conjunction with gas turbine generators has been identified as a promising candidate for grid-scale storage applications. The excellent redox cyclability of Mg-Mn-O has been demonstrated in earlier work using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and tube furnace experiments. However, in order to implement this storage technology at scale, a range of technical challenges associated with containing the 1500 °C storage medium under turbine inlet pressures (4-20 bar) have to be overcome. The current paper, for the first time demonstrates the technical feasibility of Mg-Mn-O redox thermochemical storage in an internally heated and insulated pressure vessel configuration that closely approximates a realistic engineering implementation of a redox storage module and only uses pressurized air for oxidation and suction for oxygen removal during reduction. We have constructed and tested a 1 kW/0.1 kWh bench-scale storage prototype. It consists of a cylindrical 20 bar steel pressure vessel internally insulated with open-pore high-temperature alumina. A packed bed of Mg-Mn-O pellets with an embedded Molybdenum Disilicide heater is located at the center of the storage unit. The system is charged electrically by resistive heating of the bed to 1500 °C at absolute pressures around 0.1 bar, driving the endothermic thermal reduction of Mg-Mn-O. Energy is recovered by oxidation when passing pressurized air through the porous reactive bed. The energy released heats up the air, which, in a large scale implementation, can then be expanded in the turbine section of a turbo-generator. Five consecutive reduction-oxidation cycles between 1000 to 1500 °C and 0.18 to 11 bar are carried out over 24 h. The average energy storage density is 2428 ± 469 MJ/m3. We encountered no technical problems during testing, demonstrating that a realistic engineering implementation of the Mg-Mn-O storage concept, using standard, low-cost, internally insulated carbon steel pressure vessels with heating elements embedded in a packed bed of redox pellets and only using pressurized air and suction for oxidation and reduction, respectively, is feasible meriting further scale-up of the concept.",Journal of Energy Storage
An in-situ alloyed Ni-Fe Co-reaction electrode for high-stability and high-rate Na-metal halide batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdNa-metal halide batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for large-scale energy storage systems owing to their high energy density and high safety. However, the problems of low kinetics and poor stability caused by the low-conductive chlorides have restricted the development of Na-metal halide batteries. Here, we design a facile approach that combines electrospinning and electrodeposition to prepare electrodes with a nanostructured composite containing carbon nanofibers and Ni-Fe alloy (CNF@Ni-Fe alloy). It is confirmed that the Ni-Fe alloy can stably be oxidized and reformed when discharges from 2.36 V to 2.32 V. Benefiting from the unique nanoscale arrangement of Ni-Fe, the heterogeneous distribution of FeCl2 and NiCl2 effectively overcomes the block of low-conductive chlorides. Furthermore, the coreaction of Ni2+and Fe2+ directly decreases the polarization potential, resulting in the improvement of reaction kinetics. Notably, batteries with the CNF@Ni-Fe alloy display a high specific capacity of 199.7 mAh g−1 and a capacity retention rate of 99% after 50 cycles at 0.6 C. The CNF@Ni-Fe alloy cathodes also deliver long-term stability with 104.5 mAh g−1 capacity retention after 600 cycles at 2 C and a good rate capability of 5 C.",Materials Today Energy
Potassium hydroxide activated carbon derived from albumen as an efficient sulfur host for room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021The room temperature sodium–sulfur (RT/NaS) battery provides a potential energy storage technology with high theoretical capacity and low cost. However, the gap between its practical performance and theoretical expectation confines its comprehensive implementation. In this work, a simple annealing process successfully synthesized a hierarchical micro/mesoporous egg carbon with KOH activation (ECK) from albumen as sulfur hosting for RT/NaS batteries. KOH activation plays a vital role in enhancing conductivity, surface area, and porosity. Elemental sulfur was loaded to the ECK through simple heat evaporation to form an ECK@S composite. Even at the high rate of 1 C, the discharge capacity of the ECK@S electrode reached 473 mAh/g and maintained 202 mAh/g after 800 cycles, representing an outstanding performance. Therefore, preparing micro/mesoporous egg carbon by KOH activation creates a promising electrode material for RT/NaS batteries.",Journal of Energy Storage

Binder-Free and High-Loading Cathode Realized by Hierarchical Structure for Potassium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHPotassium–sulfur batteries have attracted significant research attention owing to the naturally abundant resources of potassium and sulfur, and have promising applications in large-scale energy storage systems. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of K+, low reaction activity of sulfur species, shuttling effect of polysulfides, and large volume change impede the development of these batteries. Moreover, the conventional electrode fabrication method with binders and current collectors renders it difficult to improve the areal sulfur loading and energy density. In this study, a binder-free and freestanding sulfur cathode is prepared by phase inversion and sulfurization of polyacrylonitrile. This sulfur cathode, with a hierarchically porous network, enables a high reversible capacity of 1345 mAh g−1 and a stable cycling performance with a capacity decay of 0.15% per cycle. Importantly, areal capacities of 3.1 and 4.2 mAh cm−2 are achieved even at high sulfur loadings of 3 and 7 mg cm−2, owing to the favorable electron/ion transport in the cathode. The facile preparation method and excellent electrochemical properties reported herein can pave the way for developing high-performance K-S batteries.",Small Methods
In-situ construction of a NaF-rich cathode–electrolyte interface on Prussian blue toward a 3000-cycle-life sodium-ion battery,"© 2021As a kind of high-voltage cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the instability of a cathode–electrolyte interface (CEI) of Prussian blue (PB) results in the consumption of electrolyte and poor cycling life. Herein, an artificial NaF-rich CEI is in-situ designed on a PB cathode via a chemically presodiated strategy to remarkably prolong the cycling life of SIBs. Based on a spontaneous redox reaction between a chemical presodiation solvent and a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder, a homogeneous, thin, and NaF-rich CEI is conformally coated on the surface of PB, forming CEI@PB. The components of CEI within CEI@PB mainly comprise inorganic Na-salts (NaF, Na2CO3, and NaHCO3) and organic Na-based species (R-O-Na, R–CO–Na, and R–O2CO–Na), which can ensure the rapid transport of Na+ ions while effectively preventing CEI@PB against the attack of organic solvent and improving its cycling stability. Besides, density functional theory calculations also reveal that NaF is a good electronic insulator and ionic conductor, which is suitable as a stable CEI. Benefiting from the aforementioned merits, the CEI@PB cathode with a high areal capacity of 0.61 mAh cm−2 delivers an ultra-long cycling life of 3000 cycles. More importantly, the concept of in-situ CEI can be extended to other cathodes beyond Na batteries discussed herein.",Materials Today Energy
Recent Progress on Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks and Their Derivatives in Alkali Metal–Chalcogen Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe commercialization of high-energy-density alkali metal (Li, Na, and K)–chalcogen (S, Se, and Te) batteries (AMCBs) has been primarily hindered by the volume expansion of chalcogen cathodes during repeated charging/discharging cycles, the shuttling effect of intermediates in the electrolytes, and unstable alkali metal anodes. Owing to their unique structural and physicochemical characteristics, including high specific surface areas, self-doped N atoms, open pore structure, versatile compositions, and favorable chemical stability, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and their derivatives have been widely used in different battery components, such as cathodes, anodes, separators, and interlayers, to resolve these issues simultaneously.

"Catalytic materials for lithium-sulfur batteries: mechanisms, design strategies and future perspective","© 2021 Elsevier LtdLithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are attractive candidates for post-lithium-ion battery technologies because of their ultrahigh theoretical energy density and low cost of active cathode materials. However, the commercialization of LSBs remains extremely challenging primarily due to poor cycling performance and safety concerns, which are inherently caused by low conductivity of S8 and Li2S, severe polysulfide shuttling, and high polarization by solid Li2S2/Li2S deposition. Catalytic materials could facilitate the large-scale practical application of LSBs by overcoming all these challenges. In this review, we investigate the sulfur species evolution in LSBs and explore the roles of catalytic materials in charge/discharge processes, highlighting the catalysis of solid S8 to liquid polysulfides and solid Li2S2 to Li2S. Furthermore, we offer systematic strategies from atomic to macro levels, including defect engineering, morphology engineering and catalyst compositing, to enhance catalysis efficiency in terms of sulfur supercooling, fast charge transfer, thiosulfate generation, disulfide bond cleavage, tuneable Li2S growth and Li2S decomposition enhancement. The design and availability of the proposed catalytic materials will further advance LSB technology from coin cells and pouch cells to the subsequent commercialization scale.",Materials Today
A Sodium–Antimony–Telluride Intermetallic Allows Sodium-Metal Cycling at 100% Depth of Discharge and as an Anode-Free Metal Battery,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHRepeated cold rolling and folding is employed to fabricate a metallurgical composite of sodium–antimony–telluride Na2(Sb2/6Te3/6Vac1/6) dispersed in electrochemically active sodium metal, termed “NST-Na.” This new intermetallic has a vacancy-rich thermodynamically stable face-centered-cubic structure and enables state-of-the-art electrochemical performance in widely employed carbonate and ether electrolytes. NST-Na achieves 100% depth-of-discharge (DOD) in 1 m NaPF6 in G2, with 15 mAh cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.4%, for 1000 h of plating/stripping. Sodium-metal batteries (SMBs) with NST-Na and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) or sulfur cathodes give significantly improved energy, cycling, and CE (>99%). An anode-free battery with NST collector and NVP obtains 0.23% capacity decay per cycle. Imaging and tomography using conventional and cryogenic microscopy (Cryo-EM) indicate that the sodium metal fills the open space inside the self-supporting sodiophilic NST skeleton, resulting in dense (pore-free and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)-free) metal deposits with flat surfaces. The baseline Na deposit consists of filament-like dendrites and “dead metal”, intermixed with pores and SEI. Density functional theory calculations show that the uniqueness of NST lies in the thermodynamic stability of the Na atoms (rather than clusters) on its surface that leads to planar wetting, and in its own stability that prevents decomposition during cycling.",Advanced Materials
Rational construction of thermally stable single atom catalysts: From atomic structure to practical applications,"© 2022 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of SciencesAs a new frontier in catalysis field, single-atom catalysts (SACs) hold unique electronic structure and high atom utilization, which have displayed unprecedented activity and selectivity toward a wide range of catalytic reactions. However, many reported SACs are susceptible to Ostwald ripening process in high temperature environment or long-term catalytic application, which will cause sintering and deactivation. This is due to the weak interaction between the metal atom and supports. The regeneration and recycling of deactivated catalysts will greatly increase the time and economic cost of industrial production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop SACs with excellent thermal stability to meet the industrial demands. Here, we discuss the fundamental comprehension of the stability of thermally stable SACs obtained from different synthesis methods. The influences of the speciation of metal centers and coordination environments on thermal stability are summarized. The importance of using novel in situ and operando characterizations to reveal dynamic structural evolution under synthesis and reaction conditions and to identify active sites of thermally stable SACs is highlighted. The mechanistic understanding of the unique role of thermally stable SACs in thermocatalytic application is also discussed. At last, a brief perspective on the remaining challenges and future directions of thermally stable SACs is presented.",Chinese Journal of Catalysis
NaF-rich solid electrolyte interphase for dendrite-free sodium metal batteries,"© 2021Na metal is a promising candidate as anode material owing to its high theoretical energy density and abundance on earth, but suffers from dendrite growth, extremely large volume change, and poor Coulombic efficiency. Herein, a low-cost and effective strategy is developed to discourage the dendrite growth by in situ formation of an artificial NaF-rich protective layer on Na metal. The protective layer facilitates the formation of highly stable, NaF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) capable of preventing continuous electrolyte depletion during charge/discharge cycles. The depth profiling experiment confirms functional gradient of SEI through its thickness with wealthier NaF species towards the Na metal. The symmetric cells assembled using the Na anode with a protective layer exhibit excellent cyclic stability with low overpotentials of 8, 50, and 70 mV, at areal currents of 1, 5 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively, thanks to its high dendrite suppression ability as proven by theoretical calculations. The full battery prepared with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode delivers 99% retention of Coulombic efficiency after 400 and 600 cycles at 1C in ether- and carbonate-based electrolytes, respectively. The SEI layer design strategy presented here can shed some important insights into the development of high-performance dendrite-free Na metal batteries and interface engineering for solid electrolytes.",Energy Storage Materials

"Theory of soft solid electrolytes: Overall properties of composite electrolytes, effect of deformation and microstructural design for enhanced ionic conductivity","© 2021 Elsevier LtdRe-chargeable batteries are an important element in the solution to the future of portable energy storage. In that context, electrolytes play a critical role in the adjudication of a battery's capacity, efficiency and operation. In most current embodiments of rechargeable batteries, including the widely researched lithium-ion system, electrolytes are liquid. That said, the use of solid electrolytes in lieu of their liquid counterparts is being increasingly explored. Solid electrolytes offer increased stability and improved safety and (specifically polymers) are also ideal candidates in the context of stretchable and flexible electronics. Unfortunately, most solid polymer electrolytes possess ionic conductivity that is orders of magnitude lower than typical liquid electrolytes. In this work, we explore the possibility of microstructure design to enhance the effective ionic conductivity of composite polymer electrolytes. We develop a theoretical framework, grounded in thermodynamics and principles of continuum mechanics, to model the coupled deformation, electrostatics and diffusion in heterogeneous electrolytes. Guided by numerical thought experiments, we establish a homogenization procedure that significantly reduces the complexity of the original non-linear problem and derive general analytical expressions for the effective behavior of electrolytes and closed-form solutions for specific microstructures. Using insights from our model, in addition to proposing suggestions for improving the ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes, we are also able to explain several perplexing experimental observations and address questions such as: (i) Why do some experiments show a dramatic improvement in the ionic conductivity of nanoparticle-impregnated polymers while others yield a decrease? (ii) What is the effect of deformation on ionic conductivity?",Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids
Engineering zincophilic sites on Zn surface via plant extract additives for dendrite-free Zn anode,"© 2021Aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage owing to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, the formation of Zn dendrite caused by uneven deposition on Zn anode severely impedes the lifespan of AZIBs. Herein, we propose a green and low-cost additive, nettle extract (NE), to guide the uniform Zn deposition via in-situ engineered zincophilic sites. We show by both experiments and theoretical calculations that the zincophilic molecules contained in NE can adsorb on Zn anode surface to offer more effective sites for Zn nucleation, thus effectively suppressing the dendrite growth. Significantly, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell with NE can stably cycle over 2200 h at 5 mA cm−2 with 5 mAh cm−2 capacity. A Zn||polyaniline/carbon felt full cell also gains 84.9% capacity retention after 1500 cycles.

"A Self-Healable Sulfide/Polymer Composite Electrolyte for Long-Life, Low-Lithium-Excess Lithium-Metal Batteries","© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSolid electrolyte-protected lithium-metal anodes promise energy-dense, safe cells. While sulfide solid electrolytes enable facile processability and fast ion transport, they suffer from complex chemo-mechanical issues, including Li plating-induced fracture and Li stripping-induced contact loss. To address these issues, a grafting approach is implemented to functionalize the sulfide solid electrolyte (Li3,85Sn0.85Sb0.15S4) with a self-healing unit. This leads to a dynamic bonding between the solid electrolyte network and a mechanically robust polymer scaffold, which reversibly accommodates the volume changes of the lithium-metal anode. Moreover, the approach improves the interfacial contact between the lithium-metal anode and the composite electrolyte, enabling stable cycling at a mild stack pressure (160 kPa). With a negative to positive capacity ratio equals to 1, pouch full cells with a high-nickel cathode (nickel content > 90%) and lithium-metal anode display 92% capacity retention for 140 cycles.

A ketone-containing all-solid-state polymer electrolyte with rapid Li-ion conduction for lithium metal batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Solid-state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have gained considerable attention in the application of all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), but the low ionic conductivity at room temperature and inferior interfacial compatibility largely drag the practical development of SPEs. Herein, a ketone-containing poly(allyl acetoacetate) (PAAA) based polymer electrolyte is designed and prepared for the first time. The structure of ester and ketone groups provides PAAA polymers with not only strong dissociation of lithium salts but also weak coordination interactions with Li+ ions. Thus the prepared PAAA polymer electrolytes show excellent ion conductive behavior with ionic conductivity as high as 1.1 × 10-4 S cm−1 at 30 °C. Moreover, the PAAA polymer electrolytes still maintain superior viscoelasticity without compromising mechanical integrity. When assembling cells, the reduction-tolerant poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) polymer electrolytes are employed as interlayers between the PAAA SPEs and lithium electrodes in order to improve interfacial stability. As a result, the hierarchical polymer electrolytes possess wide electrochemical window above 4.8 V, thus matching well with LiFePO4 or Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 high-voltage cathode. The hierarchical structure does not affect interfacial contact, and the Li/PEO-PAAA-PEO/Li cells show low interfacial resistance and stable striping/plating behavior for at least 500 h at 0.2 mA cm−2 and 60 °C. This study enriches carbonyl-based polymer electrolytes by allying ketone with ester groups, and provides guidance for designing novel high-performance polymer electrolytes for practical application.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Analysis of process parameters affecting the crystal orientation of Na+-β″-Al2O3 solid electrolyte in one-step synthesis cum sintering process,"© 2021Na+-ion conducting Na+-β""-Al2O3 solid electrolyte has been prepared by a one-step synthesis cum sintering process as an alternative to the conventional solid-state reaction process, and the degree of crystal orientation was evaluated by the Lotgering factor with XRD Cu-Kα radiation source. In order to analyze the process parameters which affect the value of Lotgering factor, two experiments were carried out separately, i.e. on dwelling at various temperatures before sintering and different granule sizes selected in the press-forming. The Na+-β""-Al2O3 fabricated by one-step synthesis cum sintering process fully crystalized without any secondary phase. As a result, lower values of Lotgering factor indicated a higher ionic conductivity of Na+-β""-Al2O3. Among the processes including the heat treatment step, the smallest Lotgering factor was observed in the dwelling temperature of 1000 °C for 2 h. In terms of granule size, the smaller grain size showed the lower Lotgering factor.",Materials Research Bulletin
Effective resistance to dendrite growth of NASICON solid electrolyte with lower electronic conductivity,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The interface resistance, relative density and electronic conductivity of ceramic electrolytes show great influences on the formation of dendrites, which is the dominant challenge of solid-state lithium/sodium batteries in the practical application. In this work, NASICON electrolytes (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) with enhanced ionic conductivity, improved relative density and lowered electronic conductivity were demonstrated through doping lanthanide ions (Pr3+, Eu3+ and Lu3+). The influences of lanthanide ions doping on the crystalline structure, density, ionic/electronic conductivity and the application performances especially for the resistance to dendrite growth were investigated in detail. The ionic conductivity and relative density were promoted whereas the electronic conductivity was reduced obviously for the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 electrolyte with the presence of lanthanide ions with low electronegativity, resulting in the promoted resistance to dendrite growth. Among the three types of rare earth ions, highest critical current density (CCD) of 0.9 mA/cm2 at RT was recorded for the Pr3+ doped Na3Zr2Si2PO12 electrolyte due to its compact microstructure and low electronic conductivity, owing to the substitution of Zr4+ ions by the Pr3+ ions with smallest electronegativity and largest ion radius. The presented results proved that the doping of appropriate rare earth ions can significantly decrease the electronic conductivity, resulting in the resistance to sodium dendrite for NASICON solid electrolyte.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Herein, we further research sulfurized-pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile (S@pPAN) composite containing 47.3 wt% sulfur as cathode of Mg-S batteries with nucleophilic (PhMgCl)2-AlCl3 + LiCl/THF electrolyte. Except a significant restraint of the reaction between the nucleophilic electrolyte and the electrophilic sulfur, polysulfide dissolution and shuttle are effectively suppressed. Electrochemical performance is further enhanced using MBA-(MgCl2)2-(AlCl3)2 + LiCl/THF non-nucleophilic electrolyte with 677.9 mAh g−1 specific capacity and 75.9% cycling stability after 85 cycles at 0.1C.

Multivalent metal–sulfur batteries for green and cost-effective energy storage: Current status and challenges,"© 2021 Science PressMultivalent metal–sulfur (M-S, where M = Mg, Al, Ca, Zn, Fe, etc.) batteries offer unique opportunities to achieve high specific capacity, elemental abundancy and cost-effectiveness beyond lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the slow diffusion of multivalent-metal ions and the shuttle of soluble polysulfide result in impoverished reversible capacity and limited cycle performance of M−S (Mg–S, Al–S, Ca–S, Zn–S, Fe–S, etc.) batteries. It is a necessity to optimize the electrochemical performance, while deepening the understanding of the unique electrochemical reaction mechanism, such as the intrinsic multi-electron reaction process, polysulfides dissolution and the instability of metal anodes. To solve these problems, we have summarized the state-of-the-art progress of current M−S batteries, and sorted out the existing challenges for different multivalent M−S batteries according to sulfur cathode, electrolytes, metallic anode and current collectors/separators, respectively. In this literature, we have surveyed and exemplified the strategies developed for better M−S batteries to strengthen the application of green, cost-effective and high energy density M−S batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Ultrastable Na-TiS2 battery enabled by in situ construction of gel polymer electrolyte,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Sodium (Na) metal batteries are low-cost, high-capacity alternatives for lithium-ion batteries. However, the safety concerns brought by the metallic Na hinder the development of Na metal batteries. Herein, we in situ construct a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) under mild condition for Na-TiS2 battery to diminish the safety hazard. The room-temperature ionic conductivity of the GPE reaches 3.66 × 10−4 S cm−1. The transference number of Na+ is 0.66 and the excellent stability with Na metal anode is achieved. The in situ formed GPE can minimize the side reactions between Na metal anode and the electrolyte, and simultaneously the lower fluidity can hinder the shuttle effect of pulverized TiS2 cathode during cycling, significantly improving the cycling performance. The Na|Na symmetric cell shows stable cycling over 1300 h at 1.0 mA cm−2. The Na|TiS2 cell illustrates an ultralong cycle life of more than 6100 h at 50 mA g−1 with the reversible capacity of 371 mAh g−1. The cell can also be cycled 1000 times with the reversible capacity of 321 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1. We believe the work can inspire the development of the high-safety, low-cost, and long-cycle-life sodium batteries as energy storage systems.",Journal of Power Sources
An Efficient Strategy toward Multichambered Carbon Nanoboxes with Multiple Spatial Confinement for Advanced Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Intricate hollow carbon structures possess vital function for anchoring polysulfides and enhancing the utilization of sulfur in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. However, their synthesis is extremely challenging due to the complex structure. Here, a facile and efficient strategy is developed for the controllable synthesis of N/O-doped multichambered carbon nanoboxes (MCCBs) by selective etching and stepwise carbonization of ZIF-8 nanocubes. The MCCBs consist of porous carbon shells on the outside and connected carbon grids with a hollow structure on the inside, bringing about a MCCBs structure. As a sulfur host, the multichambered structure has better spatial encapsulation and integrated conductivity via the inner interconnected carbon grids, which combines the characteristics of short charge transfer path and superb physicochemical adsorption along with mechanical strength. As expected, the S@MCCBs cathode realizes decent cycle stability (0.045% capacity decay per cycle over 800 cycles at 5 A g-1) and enhanced rate performance (328 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1). Furthermore, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation confirms the good structural stability of the S@MCCBs during the (de)sodiation process. Our work demonstrates an effective strategy for the rational design and accurate construction of intricate hollow materials for high-performance energy storage systems.",ACS Nano
Achieving F-doped porous hollow carbon nanospheres with ultrahigh pore volumeviaa gas-solid interface reaction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Finding a tunable and facile method to make functional porous hollow carbons with ultrahigh-pore-volume hierarchical porous structures and well-designed functionalities has been challenging. Herein, we present a gas-solid interface reaction approach for one-step synthesis of fluorine-doped hierarchical porous hollow carbon nanospheres (FPHCs) controlled by employing SiO2or Si spheres as a sacrificial template, and Teflon as a carbon, fluorine, and etching gas source. The afforded FPHCs feature an ultrahigh pore volume of up to 7.16 cm3g−1, which is the highest pore volume for porous hollow carbons reported so far, tunable hierarchical pore sizes, and a high fluorine-doping content, endowing them with excellent electrochemical performance in high-sulfur-content Li-S batteries. This novel approach may open up new horizons to construct ultrahigh-pore-volume functional porous hollow carbons for sustainable energy applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
High-performance lithium-sulfur battery enabled by jointing cobalt decorated interlayer and polyethyleneimine functionalized separator,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is considered as one of the most promising alternatives for next-generation electrochemical energy storage systems due to its high energy density and low cost. Unfortunately, several issues of Li-S battery, such as sluggish reaction kinetics, severe polysulfides shuttle effect and volume expansion, still hinder the commercialization of Li-S battery. Herein, a synergistic strategy is proposed, which comprises polyethyleneimine (PEI)-multi-walled carbon nanotube-Super P (PMS) coating modified on PP separator and uniformly distributed cobalt nanocrystals in N-doped porous carbon nanofiber (Co/PCNF) as a freestanding interlayer in the cathodic side of Li-S battery. Benefiting from abundant amino/imine groups of protonated PEI and catalytic Co active sites in conductive porous carbon skeleton, the Co/PCNF-PMS bilayer architecture can not only intensely anchor the negatively charged polysulfides via electrostatic interaction but also fast electrocatalyze the sulfur redox reaction. The synergistic effect of the Co/PCNF-PMS bilayer enable the Li-S battery with a high initial capacity of 1537 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1, extended cycling stability of only 0.06% per cycle capacity fade over 300 cycles at 2000 mA g−1 and outstanding performance under high raised sulfur loading up to 6 mg cm−2.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Sulfurized Cyclopentadienyl Nanocomposites for Shuttle-Free Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyA major challenge hindering the practical adoption of room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries (NaSBs) is polysulfide dissolution and shuttling, which results in irreversible capacity decay and low Coulombic efficiencies. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time NaSBs using a ferrocene-derived amorphous sulfurized cyclopentadienyl composite (SCC) cathode. Polysulfide dissolution is eliminated via covalent bonding between the insoluble short-chain sulfur species and carbon backbone. Control experiments with a metal-free composite analogue determined that the iron species in the SCC does not have a significant role in polysulfide anchoring. Instead, the superior electrochemical performance is attributed to sulfur covalently bonded to carbon and the uniform nanoparticulate morphology of the SCC composite. In the carbonate-based electrolyte, a discharge capacity of 795 mAh g(S)–1 was achieved during early cycling at 0.2 C, and high Coulombic efficiencies close to 100% were maintained with capacity retention of 532 and 442 mAh g(S)–1 after 100 and 200 cycles, respectively.",Nano Letters

Studies using in/ex situ characterization and electrode kinetics are implemented to reveal the possible reasons for the stability and electrochemical activity of NVPFCl. This work may provide a pathway for the development of all-climate and storage-stable SIB cathode materials.",Cell Reports Physical Science
An optimized combination inspired by the wooden-barrel effect for Li-S pouch cells,"© 2021 The Author(s)Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising alternatives for next-generation energy storage and conversion due to the low cost of raw materials and high theoretical energy density.

In recent years, many advanced components have been reported, but few have been applied in practical Li-S batteries. Inspired by the wooden-barrel effect, in this perspective, we propose an optimized combination that integrates all advanced components into one system.

Highly Stable Lithium/Sodium Metal Batteries with High Utilization Enabled by a Holey Two-Dimensional N-Doped TiNb2O7 Host,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyLithium/sodium metal batteries have attracted enormous attention as promising candidates for high-energy storage devices. However, their practical applications are impeded by the growth of dendrites upon Li/Na plating. Here, we report that holey 2D N-doped TiNb2O7 (N-TNO) nanosheets with high electroactive surface area and large amounts of lithiophilic/sodiophilic sites can effectively regulate Li/Na deposition as an interfacial layer, leading to an excellent cycling stability. The N-TNO interfacial layer enables the Li||Li symmetric cell to sustain stable electrodeposition over 1000 h as well as the Na||Na cell to stably cycle for 2400 h at 1 mA cm–2 and 3 mA h cm–2 with a depth of discharge as high as 50%. The full cells of the Li/Na anodes based on the N-TNO layer paired with the LiFePO4 and NaTi2(PO4)3 cathodes, respectively, show a very stable cycling over 1000 cycles at a negative-to-positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio up to 3.",Nano Letters
Artificial interphase engineering to stabilize aqueous zinc metal anodes,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Aqueous Zn-ion system combining the advantages of energy density, intrinsic safety, and environmental benignity, has been regarded as a promising power source for future electronics. Besides cathodes and electrolytes, more attention should be paid to stabilizing zinc metal anodes since the main challenges in current aqueous Zn-ion batteries are still the hydrogen evolution and dendrite growth of the zinc anode. Thereupon, artificial interphase engineering that integrates the highly tunable, selectable, and controllable characteristics becomes one of the most effective ways to stabilize zinc anodes. In this mini-review, state-of-the-art knowledge on the rational interphase engineering of aqueous zinc metal anodes in the functional layer coating and in situ solid electrolyte interphase formation are covered.

Design Principles of Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Engineered Interfaces in Na–S Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyThe shuttling of soluble sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn) and sluggish conversion kinetics are major roadblocks toward the practical realization of sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries. To undertake the challenges, we use first-principles calculations to design bifunctional electrocatalysts to achieve engineered interfaces with sulfur-based cathode materials. We illustrate the detailed behavior of Na2Sn adsorption, sulfur reduction reactions (SRRs), and catalytic decomposition on transition-metal (TM)-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) embedded on MoS2 substrates (SACs@MoS2). We observe that SACs doped on sulfur substitution and molybdenum top sites result in adequate binding energies to immobilize higher-order Na2Sn species. We found the d-band center as an important “descriptor” in dictating polysulfide adsorption energies and catalytic activities on SACs@MoS2. We elucidate that the larger upward shift of the d-band center toward the Fermi level and the involved higher number of vacant antibonding states are directly correlated to the adsorption strength of the Na2Sn. The V and Ni SACs are found to exhibit higher and lower binding energies, respectively, consistent with the d-band theory. Furthermore, the SACs that are electron-deficient sites demonstrate bifunctional electrocatalytic activity through reduced free energy for SRR and lower the barrier for Na2S decomposition in favor of accelerated electrode kinetics during discharge and charge processes, respectively. The electronic structure calculations reveal a significantly reduced band gap of the pristine and Na2Sn-adsorbed SACs@MoS2 due to mid-gap states, majorly stemming from TM-d orbitals, thus expected to improve the electronic conductivity of the substrates. The insight developed on the role of SACs in tailoring the polysulfides’ chemistry at the interfaces in relation to their d-band center is an important step toward the rational design of cathode materials for high-performance Na–S batteries.",ACS Catalysis
Performance enhancement of rechargeable magnesium–sulfur batteries based on a sulfurized poly(acrylonitrile) composite and a lithium salt,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Research on magnesium-sulfur (Mg–S) batteries has gained great attention due to the high theoretical gravimetric and volumetric energy densities (1700 Wh kg−1 and 3200 Wh L−1), as well as because of their economic, ecologic and safety advantages. In this study, we present room-temperature Mg–S batteries with a sulfurized poly(acrylonitrile) composite (SPAN) cathode and a Mg2+/Li+ hybrid electrolyte (magnesium trifluoromethanesulfonate, (CF3SO3)2Mg), lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate, MgCl2 and AlCl3 in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME)). These cells deliver high discharge capacities and energy densities of 1100 mAh gs−1 and 700 Wh kgs−1 at 1 C, respectively, with >99.9% Coulombic efficiency. Electrochemical and kinetic measurements as well as post-mortem analysis revealed that utilization of SPAN and a lithium salt in the electrolyte is crucial and beneficial for the prevention of the polysulfide shuttle. It also dramatically reduces the cell resistance and the overpotential via the formation of MgLiSx species. Concomitantly, this system supports the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which greatly improves the reaction kinetics of the Mg2+ ions and the cycle performance.",Journal of Power Sources
Advanced opportunities and insights on the influence of nitrogen incorporation on the physico-/electro-chemical properties of robust electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic energy conversion,"© 2021The use of a wide range of methods for incorporating nitrogen atoms on robust catalysts has given rise to fundamental advances in the field of energy conversion and storage. Recently, nitrogen incorporation has proven to be able to fine-tune the electron densities of exposed active sites to create high-performance electrocatalysts. The preservation of a strong interface between the local atomic coordination of nitrogen atoms on bare carbon, single metal atoms, transition metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, and MXenes during synthesis plays an important role in producing an efficient electrocatalysts.

Lithium anode in carbonate-based electrolyte: High-performance by self-protected solid-electrolyte-interphase,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Lithium metal is considered as the ultimate negative electrode for future high-energy batteries because of its lowest electrode potential and very high theoretical capacity. However, its practical application is severely plagued by the hazardous lithium dendritic growth upon charge and low coulombic efficiency resulting from the inhomogeneous mass and charge transfers across the Li/electrolyte interface. Herein we report an economical and effective approach to step out of this dilemma, using self-protected Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in carbonate-based electrolyte with Vinylethylene carbonate (VEC) additive. VEC as a sacrificing material can prevent the Li salts and solvent decomposition, and further free radical reaction of VEC decomposition products in-situ form self-protected highly uniform and mechanical strength SEI layer on Li metal surface. The versatile effects of this unique SEI layer are demonstrated by the uniform lithium plating/stripping and very high Coulombic efficiency (up to 96% after 150 cycles at 1 mA cm−2 with 1 mAh cm−2). Lithium metal batteries, employing the self-protected Li metal negative electrode coupled with LiFePO4, exhibit excellent performance in both cycling stability and rate capability. Even the anode free cell Cu|NMC811, an impressive high initial coulombic efficiency of 92.5% and promising improvement of cycling performance are achieved.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Enhanced reversible capacity of sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode for room-temperature Na/S batteries by electrochemical activation,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Low costs and high theoretical energy densities make room-temperature Na/S batteries attractive for large-scale applications. However, obtaining sulfur cathodes with high reversible capacities remains challenging. For sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathode, we found the reaction mechanism between sodium and sulfur, and then developed a method to obtain high reversible capacity by electrochemical activation. During the first discharge (sodiation), one sodium per sulfur atom reacts irreversibly with the conjugated carbon backbone, which reduces the resistance of SPAN. Upon further sodiation, sodium reversibly reacts with free sulfur generated by cleaving C–S and S–S bonds in SPAN to form Na2S. After simple activation, i.e. further sodiation, 1.8 sodium atoms per sulfur atom, the reversible discharge capacity reaches 1502 mAh g−1-sulfur, similar to the theoretical capacity of Na2S, which is the highest value ever reported. After 100 cycles, the capacity remains at 1405 mAh g−1-sulfur; thus, the energy density of SPAN is 543 Wh kg−1, much higher than the theoretical value for lithium-ion batteries. The reported reaction mechanism and activation process provide new strategies for room-temperature Na/S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Investigation of alkali and alkaline earth solvation structures in tetraglyme solvent,"© the Owner Societies.This study compares molecular calculations performed with molecular and periodic codes through an investigation of the solvation structures of alkali and alkaline earth metal ions in tetraglyme solution. The two codes are able to produce equivalent structural and energetic information at the same level of theory, and in the presence of the implicit solvation model or not. This comparison reveals that molecular optimisations can be performed with periodic codes and used directly as input models for interface or electrochemistry calculations in order to preserve the solvent-solute interaction and the cavitation energy. By a rigorous comparison, we have demonstrated that equivalent energetic values can be obtained with the conventional PBE-D3 and the newly developed SCAN-rVV10 functionals. Nevertheless, as far as the vibrational features are concerned and when the molecule possesses a highly conjugated system, the SCAN-rVV10 functional is required to describe the vibrational modes properly. The computed IR/Raman spectra can thus be used as essential information to determine the first solvation shell of metal ions in glyme-based solutions. In tetraglyme solution, the alkali and alkaline earth metal ions exhibit a diverse solvation structure. Small ions like Li+ and Mg2+ tend to adopt a coordination number of five or six, while larger ions, Na+, K+, and Ca2+, prefer an eight-coordinated environment, and the metal-ligand interaction increases in the order K+-O < Na+-O < Li+-O < Ca2+-O < Mg2+-O. The solvation spheres play a significant role in the stability and the reactivity of the solvated ions, and can thus be used as input models to construct the solvation structure in more sophisticated electrolytes, such as polyethylene oxide, or perform electrochemical calculations.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Stable Dendrite-Free Sodium-Sulfur Batteries Enabled by a Localized High-Concentration Electrolyte,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Ambient-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries are an appealing, sustainable, and low-cost alternative to lithium-ion batteries due to their high material abundance and specific energy of 1274 W h kg-1. However, their viability is hampered by Na polysulfide (NaPS) shuttling, Na loss due to side reactions with the electrolyte, and dendrite formation. Here, we demonstrate that a solid-electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic components can be realized at both the sulfur cathode and the Na anode by tweaking the solvation structure of the electrolyte. This transforms the sulfur redox process from conventional dissolution-precipitation chemistry into a quasi-solid-state reaction, which eliminates NaPS shuttling and facilitates dendrite-free Na-metal plating and stripping. With the solvated ionic liquid electrolyte structure, a high initial capacity of 922 mA h g-1 with a capacity fade of as low as 0.10% per cycle over 300 cycles was achieved. The scalability of this approach to pouch cells with practically necessary parameters demonstrates its potential for practical viability.",Journal of the American Chemical Society

All rights reserved.Functional mesoporous materials have gained tremendous attention due to their distinctive properties and potential applications. In recent decades, the self-assembly of micelles and framework precursors into mesostructures on the liquid-solid, liquid-liquid, and gas-liquid interface has been explored in the construction of functional mesoporous materials with diverse compositions, morphologies, mesostructures, and pore sizes. Compared with the one-phase solution synthetic approach, the introduction of a two-phase interface in the synthetic system changes self-assembly behaviors between micelles and framework species, leading to the possibility for the on-demand fabrication of unique mesoporous architectures. In addition, controlling the interfacial tension is critical to manipulate the self-assembly process for precise synthesis. In particular, recent breakthroughs based on the concept of the ""monomicelles""assembly mechanism are very promising and interesting for the synthesis of functional mesoporous materials with the precise control. In this review, we highlight the synthetic strategies, principles, and interface engineering at the macroscale, microscale, and nanoscale for oriented interfacial assembly of functional mesoporous materials over the past 10 years. The potential applications in various fields, including adsorption, separation, sensors, catalysis, energy storage, solar cells, and biomedicine, are discussed.

Turning the Byproduct Zn4(OH)6SO4· xH2O into a Uniform Solid Electrolyte Interphase to Stabilize Aqueous Zn Anode,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Aqueous Zn anodes suffer from continuous side reactions and severe dendrite growth upon Zn plating and stripping, mainly due to the lack of an efficient protective layer. Herein, we report a facile approach to turn the byproduct Zn4(OH)6SO4·xH2O (ZHS) into a uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) by simply introducing a small amount Zn(OH)2 into the ZnSO4 electrolyte. It is revealed that the uniform ZHS-based SEI possesses low electronic conductivity, high Zn2+ ion conductivity, and high zincophobicity, which could significantly restrain the dendrite growth and side reactions. Specifically, the designed electrolyte (1.98 M ZnSO4 + 0.02 M Zn(OH)2) enables the Zn∥Zn symmetric cell to deliver a long lifetime of 1190 h under 2 mA cm-2 with 2 mAh cm-2, and the Zn∥Ti asymmetric cell to achieve a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.2%. This control of byproducts to construct the SEI proposes new insights and design ideas for stabilizing aqueous metal anodes.",ACS Materials Letters

Two heavily W-doped sodium thioantimonate SSEs, Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 and Na2.7W0.3Sb0.7S4 are designed, both exhibiting exceptionally low activation energy and enhanced room temperature (RT) ionic conductivity; 0.09 eV, 24.2 mS/cm and 0.12 eV, 14.5 mS/cm. At −15 °C the Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 displays a total ionic conductivity of 5.5 mS/cm. The 30 % W content goes far beyond the 10–12 % reported in the prior studies, and results in novel pseudo-cubic or orthorhombic structures.

However, the shuttle effect caused by the dissolution of polysulfides leads to irreversible loss of capacity. Herein, we prepare a S0.96Se0.04@CMK3 composite (with a high S + Se content of 82.6 wt %) and employ the composite material as a cathode for Mg batteries with easily prepared hybrid electrolytes. The electronic conductivity of the cathode material increases by 18 orders of magnitude after Se doping, from 5 × 10-28 to 6.5 × 10-10 S m-1. Compared with S@CMK3, doped Se in S0.96Se0.04@CMK3 plays an important role in maintaining capacity stability by lowering polarization, facilitating electron transport, and improving reaction kinetics. The S0.96Se0.04@CMK3 cathode delivers a stable and reversible capacity of 492.9 mAh g-1 after 110 cycles, which is almost twice that of the S@CMK cathode without Se doping, and better rate performance. This Se-doping strategy proposes an effective method to exploit high-performance cathodes for Mg-S batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C

Here, a side-by-side comparison of the processes at the two metal anodes and at the sulfur cathode in Li+- or Mg2+-based electrolytes highlights how most of the challenges facing magnesium-sulfur batteries are intrinsically rooted in the nature of the magnesium species, requiring different research directions than lithium-sulfur batteries.

"Insight into the Anchoring Effect of Two-Dimensional TiX2(X = S, Se, Te) Materials for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: A DFT Study","© 2021 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS""). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.It is desirable to develop suitable anchoring materials to refrain the notorious shuttle phenomenon in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs), especially TiS2, with excellent physicochemical properties have attracted much attention. Here, in this work, density functional theory (DFT) computations were performed to systematically explore the adsorption behaviors of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) over TiX2 (X = S, Se, Te) monolayer. It is concluded that TiS2 shows the best anchoring effect owing to the strongest adsorption energy. And it's found that the intrinsic structures of LiPSs after adsorption could be preserved by calculating the decomposition energy. Moreover, the low diffusion energy barrier of Li2S on TiS2 surface is expected to accelerate the kinetics during the charge/discharge process. Based on a series of calculations and discussion, we can theoretically demonstrate that TiS2, as an anchoring material, has advantages over TiSe2 and TiTe2 in enhancing Li-S batteries performance.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
Coupling two-dimensional fillers with polymer chains in solid polymer electrolyte for room-temperature dendrite-free lithium-metal batteries,"© 2021The urgent demand for high security and high energy density all-solid-state batteries has generated a strong interest in polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based solid polymer electrolyte (SPE). However, devising a SPE with a high ionic conductivity without sacrificing mechanical properties remains a critical challenge. Herein, an interpenetrating polymer network electrolyte is designed by chemical grafting coupling, where 2D boron nitride nanosheets and poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate were coupled by a silane coupling agent. A considerable intensification of mechanical strength has been achieved for the SPE via the graft-coupling strategy, and the interpenetrating network with BNNs leads to the generation of amorphous regions for fast Li-ion immigration. The electrolyte integrates high mechanical strength with enhanced room-temperature ionic conductivity, enabling a long-cycle stability dendrite-free Li||Li symmetrical cell, and prominent cyclic performance is demonstrated in full cells at room temperature. Our approach provides a broader promise for the practical applications of solid-state batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
A Mo5N6 electrocatalyst for efficient Na2S electrodeposition in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s).Metal sulfides electrodeposition in sulfur cathodes mitigates the shuttle effect of polysulfides to achieve high Coulombic efficiency in secondary metal-sulfur batteries. However, fundamental understanding of metal sulfides electrodeposition and kinetics mechanism remains limited. Here using room-temperature sodium-sulfur cells as a model system, we report a Mo5N6 cathode material that enables efficient Na2S electrodeposition to achieve an initial discharge capacity of 512 mAh g−1 at a specific current of 1 675 mA g−1, and a final discharge capacity of 186 mAh g−1 after 10,000 cycles. Combined analyses from synchrotron-based spectroscopic characterizations, electrochemical kinetics measurements and density functional theory computations confirm that the high d-band position results in a low Na2S2 dissociation free energy for Mo5N6.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The increase of electric vehicles (EVs), environmental concerns, energy preservation, battery selection, and characteristics have demonstrated the headway of EV development. It is known that the battery units require special considerations because of their nature of temperature sensitivity, aging effects, degradation, cost, and sustainability. Hence, EV advancement is currently concerned where batteries are the energy accumulating infers for EVs. This paper discusses recent trends and developments in battery deployment for EVs. Systematic reviews on explicit energy, state-of-charge, thermal efficiency, energy productivity, life cycle, battery size, market revenue, security, and commerciality are provided. The review includes battery-based energy storage advances and their development, characterizations, qualities of power transformation, and evaluation measures with advantages and burdens for EV applications. This study offers a guide for better battery selection based on exceptional performance proposed for traction applications (e.g., BEVs and HEVs), considering EV’s advancement subjected to sustainability issues, such as resource depletion and the release in the environment of ozone and carbon-damaging substances. This study also provides a case study on an aging assessment for the different types of batteries investigated. The case study targeted lithium-ion battery cells and how aging analysis can be influenced by factors such as ambient temperature, cell temperature, and charging and discharging currents. These parameters showed considerable impacts on life cycle numbers, as a capacity fading of 18.42%, between 25–65◦C was observed.

Construction of kb@zif-8/pp composite separator for lithium–sulfur batteries with enhanced electrochemical performance,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) have attracted wide attention, but the shuttle effect of polysulfide hinders their further practical application. Herein, we develop a new strategy to construct a Ketjen black@zeolite imidazole framework-8/polypropylene composite separator. Such a separator consists of Ketjen black (KB), zeolite imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) and polypropylene (PP) with a low coating load of 0.06 mg cm−2 and is denoted as KB@ZIF-8/PP. KB@ZIF-8/PP can absorb polysulfides because of the Lewis acid-base interaction between ZIF-8 and polysulfides. This interaction can reduce the dissolution of polysulfides and suppress the shuttle effect, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of the battery. When tested at a current density of 0.1 C, an LSB with a KB@ZIF-8/PP separator exhibits low polarization and achieves a high initial capacity of 1235.6 mAh/g and a high capacity retention rate of 59.27% after 100 cycles.",Polymers
Tuning the electron structure enables the NiZn alloy for CO2 electroreduction to formate,"© 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesFormate is an important liquid chemical, which can be produced by electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Most of the metal catalysts for CO2RR to formate are toxic or noble metals, such as Cd, Hg, Pb and Pd, leading to the environmental pollution or increased production costs. Herein, we develop an environmentally friendly and low-cost NiZn alloy catalyst for CO2RR to formate. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirm the alloy structure of the prepared NiZn catalyst. As for a catalyst for CO2RR, the NiZn alloy exhibits the FEHCOO- (Faraday efficiency of HCOO–) of 36 ± 0.7% at − 0.9 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KHCO3, and remarkable stability for 40,000 s at − 0.8, −0.9, −1.0 and − 1.1 V vs. RHE, respectively. Theoretical calculation results indicate that the NiZn alloy exhibits the middle valence electron structure between the Zn and Ni metal, resulting in the favorable pathway for HCOOH formation but unfavorable for the hydrogen evolution reaction and CO production. The Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy results verify the modulated valence electron structure for NiZn alloy as compared to Ni and Zn, consistent with the theoretical calculation results. This work provides new insights into design of alloy catalysts for CO2RR to formate.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

A Fe3N/carbon composite electrocatalyst for effective polysulfides regulation in room-temperature Na-S batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s).The practical application of room-temperature Na-S batteries is hindered by the low sulfur utilization, inadequate rate capability and poor cycling performance. To circumvent these issues, here, we propose an electrocatalyst composite material comprising of N-doped nanocarbon and Fe3N. The multilayered porous network of the carbon accommodates large amounts of sulfur, decreases the detrimental effect of volume expansion, and stabilizes the electrodes structure during cycling. Experimental and theoretical results testify the Fe3N affinity to sodium polysulfides via Na-N and Fe-S bonds, leading to strong adsorption and fast dissociation of sodium polysulfides. With a sulfur content of 85 wt.%, the positive electrode tested at room-temperature in non-aqueous Na metal coin cell configuration delivers a reversible capacity of about 1165 mA h g−1 at 167.5 mA g−1, satisfactory rate capability and stable capacity of about 696 mA h g−1 for 2800 cycles at 8375 mA g−1.",Nature Communications
Thermal management of a high temperature sodium sulphur battery stack,"© 2021The sodium sulfur battery is an advanced secondary battery with high potential for grid-level storage due to their high energy density, low cost of the reactants, and high open-circuit voltage. However, as the operating temperature of the battery is high (about 300 °C), effective thermal management is required to prevent thermal runaway under high current density operation. To develop efficient thermal management strategies, a detailed, thermo-electrochemical, non-isothermal, distributed dynamic model of a sodium-sulfur battery stack is developed. Models of three thermal management strategies are developed and analyzed in this work: active cooling, passive cooling, and hybrid cooling. The active cooling strategy uses air as the cooling medium whereas, the passive cooling strategy uses a phase change material. In the hybrid cooling strategy, both active and passive cooling strategies are used. Due to the high operating temperature of the sodium sulfur batteries, the rejected heat can be utilized effectively and consequently a high variability in the heat rejection rate may not be acceptable. Performance of these strategies is analyzed under high current density operation by evaluating the variability in the cell temperature during charge/discharge cycles, temperature difference between the cells based on their locations, and variability in the heat rejection rate. The phase change-based hybrid thermal management strategy with an embedded controller maintained the temperature variation within ±/- 2.8 °C. Considering the tradeoff between the capital cost for PCM, fan power requirement, and variability in the heat rejection rate, the optimal quantity of the PCM and the maximum air velocity for the maximum current density of 260 mA/cm2 (0.55 C-rate) were found be 0.74 g/Wh and 3 m/s, respectively.",International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer
The Dual Functions of Defect-Rich Carbon Nanotubes as Both Conductive Matrix and Efficient Mediator for Li-S Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHLi-S batteries are considered a promising energy storage system owing to the great abundance of sulfur and its high specific capacity. Polysulfide shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics in sulfur cathodes significantly degrade the cycle life of Li-S batteries. A modified method is employed to create defects in carbon nanotubes (CNTs), anchoring polysulfides, and accelerating electrochemical reactions. The defect-rich CNTs (D-CNT) enable dramatic improvement in both cycling and rate performance. A specific capacity of 600 mAh g−1 with a current density of 0.5 C is achieved after 400 cycles, and even at a very high current density (5.0 C), a specific capacity of 434 mAh g−1 is observed. Cycling stability up to 1000 cycles is also achieved under the conditions of high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte. Theoretical calculations revealed that the improvement is mainly attributable to the electronic structure of defect-rich carbon, which has higher binding energy with polysulfides because of the upshift of the p-band center. Furthermore, rotating disk electrode measurements demonstrate that the defect-rich carbon can accelerate the polysulfide conversion process. It is anticipated that this new design strategy can be the starting point for mediator-like carbon materials with good conductivity and high catalytic activity for Li-S batteries.",Small

In this study, a novel MoS2/MoN heterostructure synthesized via NH3 annealing was introduced as an electrocatalyst into RT/Na–S batteries to promote the evolution of polysulfides in the catholyte with an initial specific capacity of 703 mA h g−1 and retains 392 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles. The density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, ex-situ XPS and Raman spectra were utilized to reveal moderate anchoring and the fast redox kinetics of polysulfides, significantly enhancing the cycling performance and electrochemical performance of the RT-Na/S batteries when compared with those of the RT-Na/S batteries containing pure MoS2 or MoN as the catalyst. The work provides a new strategy for guiding the design of high‐performance catalysts with manipulated chemical components and optimized adsorption ability.",Nano Energy

Fast ion diffusion kinetics based on ferroelectric and piezoelectric effect of SnO2/BaTiO3 heterostructures for high-rate sodium storage,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdAcceleration of reaction kinetics is urgently pursued for high-rate sodium ion batteries, while the utilization of ferroelectric and piezoelectric effect to form local micro electric field to facilitate ion transport has rarely been reported. Herein, a coherent tin oxide/barium titanate heterostructure encapsulated inside nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (SnO2/BaTiO3@NCNF) is introduced as sodium ion battery anode, exhibiting high capacity retention (82% over 2000 cycles at 2 A g[sbnd]1) and stunning long-term cyclability (183.4 mAh g[sbnd]1 after 10,000 cycles at 5 A g[sbnd]1). The local potential produced by piezoelectric and ferroelectric effect of BaTiO3 (BTO) can boost sodium ion diffusion kinetics and promote rate performance of SnO2 anode. The piezoelectric effect is initiated from exploiting the drawback of volume expansion of SnO2, while the ferroelectric effect is originated from the charge separation of polarized BTO particles under external electric field. Such principle is instructive for alloying-type and convention-type anodes of alkali-ion batteries.",Nano Energy
A synergistic exploitation to produce high-voltage quasi-solid-state lithium metal batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s).The current Li-based battery technology is limited in terms of energy contents.

Here, we report the combination of a heteroatom-based gel polymer electrolyte with a hybrid cathode comprising of a Li-rich oxide active material and graphite conductive agent to produce a high-energy “shuttle-relay” Li metal battery, where additional capacity is generated from the electrolyte’s anion shuttling at high voltages. The gel polymer electrolyte, prepared via in situ polymerization in an all-fluorinated electrolyte, shows adequate ionic conductivity (around 2 mS cm−1 at 25 °C), oxidation stability (up to 5.5 V vs Li/Li+), compatibility with Li metal and safety aspects (i.e., non-flammability). The polymeric electrolyte allows for a reversible insertion of hexafluorophosphate anions into the conductive graphite (i.e., dual-ion mechanism) after the removal of Li ions from Li-rich oxide (i.e., rocking-chair mechanism).",Nature Communications
Achieving stable Na metal cycling via polydopamine/multilayer graphene coating of a polypropylene separator,"© 2021, The Author(s).Sodium metal batteries are considered one of the most promising low-cost high-energy-density electrochemical energy storage systems. However, the growth of unfavourable Na metal deposition and the limited cell cycle life hamper the application of this battery system at a large scale.

The oxygen- and nitrogen- containing moieties as well as the nano- and meso- porous network of the coating allow cycling of Na metal electrodes in symmetric cell configuration for over 2000 h with a stable 4 mV overpotential at 1 mA cm−2. When tested in full Na || Na3V2(PO4)3 coin cell, the coated separator enables the delivery of a stable capacity of about 100 mAh g−1 for 500 cycles (90% capacity retention) at a specific current of 235 mA g−1 and satisfactory rate capability performances (i.e., 75 mAh g−1 at 3.5 A g−1).",Nature Communications
Molecular Cleavage of Metal-Organic Frameworks and Application to Energy Storage and Conversion,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe physicochemical properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) significantly depend on composition, topology, and porosity, which can be tuned via synthesis. In addition to a classic direct synthesis, postsynthesis modulations of MOFs, including ion exchange, installation, and destruction, can significantly expand the application. Because of a limitation of the qualitative hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory, posttreatment permits regulation of MOF structure by cleaving chemical bonds at the molecular level. Here, methods of coordination bond scission to tailor the structure are critically appraised and the application to energy storage and conversion is assessed. MOF structures synthesized by molecular-level coordination bond cleavage are described and the corresponding MOFs for electrocatalysis and renewable battery applications are evaluated. Significant emphasis is placed on various coordination bond cleavage to tune properties, including chemical groups, electronic structures, and morphologies. The review concludes with a critical perspective on practical application, together with challenges and future outlook for this emerging field.",Advanced Materials
Reversible electrochemical oxidation of sulfur in ionic liquid for high-voltage Al−S batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s).Sulfur is an important electrode material in metal−sulfur batteries. It is usually coupled with metal anodes and undergoes electrochemical reduction to form metal sulfides. Herein, we demonstrate, for the first time, the reversible sulfur oxidation process in AlCl3/carbamide ionic liquid, where sulfur is electrochemically oxidized by AlCl4− to form AlSCl7. The sulfur oxidation is: 1) highly reversible with an efficiency of ~94%; and 2) workable within a wide range of high potentials. As a result, the Al−S battery based on sulfur oxidation can be cycled steadily around ~1.8 V, which is the highest operation voltage in Al−S batteries.

Carbon aerogel based materials for secondary batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Carbon aerogels first proposed in 1989 have attracted great attention in the area of secondary batteries due to their hierarchical porous nanonetworks, adjustable surface area, good conductivity and excellent electrochemical stability. Carbon aerogels can not only serve as electroactive materials for secondary batteries, but also can serve as carbon matrices to disperse electroactive materials or to confine electroactive materials. According to the type of carbon precursors employed in the area of secondary batteries, carbon aerogels can be divided into four kinds, that is phenolic resin derived carbon aerogels, carbon nanotube aerogels, graphene aerogels and biomass derived carbon aerogels. In this review, we first provide a brief review on the synthesis of these carbon aerogels in sequence. The preparation of phenolic resin derived carbon aerogels usually involves five steps: (1) sol formation; (2) gelation; (3) solvent exchange; (4) drying; (5) carbonization. For the successful preparation of carbon nanotube aerogels, surfactant assistance or surface functionalization is necessary. Resorcinol-formaldehyde derived carbons, carbon nanotubes, biopolymers were usually employed as crosslinkers to enhance physical and chemical properties of graphene aerogels. Natural biomass could be converted into carbon aerogel by a hydrothermal treatment, freeze-drying and post-pyrolysis process. Next, we summarize the recent progress and advances on carbon aerogels and carbon aerogel based materials for secondary batteries, focusing on lithium ion batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries. For lithium ion batteries, most of researches concentrated on carbon aerogel based nanocomposites as anode materials. For lithium-sulfur batteries, carbon aerogels, heteroatoms doped carbon aerogels and carbon aerogel based nanocomposites were used as hosts for immobilization of sulfur species and as interlayers to further block the penetration of lithium polysulfides.",Sustainable Materials and Technologies

Design Principles of Sodium/Potassium Protection Layer for High-Power High-Energy Sodium/Potassium-Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes: a Case Study of Na2Te/K2Te,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe sodium (potassium)-metal anodes combine low-cost, high theoretical capacity, and high energy density, demonstrating promising application in sodium (potassium)-metal batteries. However, the dendrites’ growth on the surface of Na (K) has impeded their practical application. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) results predict Na2Te/K2Te is beneficial for Na+/K+ transport and can effectively suppress the formation of the dendrites because of low Na+/K+ migration energy barrier and ultrahigh Na+/K+ diffusion coefficient of 3.7 × 10−10 cm2 s−1/1.6 × 10−10 cm2 s−1 (300 K), respectively. Then a Na2Te protection layer is prepared by directly painting the nanosized Te powder onto the sodium-metal surface. The Na@Na2Te anode can last for 700 h in low-cost carbonate electrolytes (1 mA cm−2, 1 mAh cm−2), and the corresponding Na3V2 (PO4)3//Na@Na2Te full cell exhibits high energy density of 223 Wh kg−1 at an unprecedented power density of 29687 W kg−1 as well as an ultrahigh capacity retention of 93% after 3000 cycles at 20 C. Besides, the K@K2Te-based potassium-metal full battery also demonstrates high power density of 20 577 W kg−1 with energy density of 154 Wh kg−1.

Recent trends in the benign-by-design electrolytes for zinc batteries,"© 2021 The AuthorsAn electrolyte is a vital component that creates an avenue for zinc ions to migrate and forms a cathode–anode intermediary in zinc based battery system. Zinc metal is thermodynamically unstable and prone to dissolve in acidic aqueous solutions. Indeed, there are still a lot of issues with using a liquid electrolyte on a frequent basis.

Synthesis and characteristic of the ternary composite electrode material PTCDA/CNT@MPC and its electrochemical performance in sodium ion battery,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdA three-dimensional composite carbon material (CNT@MPC) showing coaxial cable-like structure was prepared by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and glucose through hydrothermal method. The ternary composite (PTCDA/CNT@MPC) was synthesized by coating a layer of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) molecules on the surface of CNT@MPC composite carbon material. The sodium ion battery was assembled using the ternary composite as the positive electrode material, and sodium metal as the negative electrode. The results show that the electrochemical performance of PTCDA/CNT@MPC composite is much better than that of pure PTCDA. The first discharge capacity is 131.2 mAh g−1 as the current density is 0.1 A g−1, which is close to its theoretical specific capacity of 135 mAh g−1. In particular, the battery shows better discharge properties at higher discharge current rate. When the current density reaches 10 A g−1, the PTCDA/CNT@MPC electrode material is still able to attain a superior capacity of 90.1 mAh g−1. This is due to the higher conductivity of CNT@MPC composite carbon material, which not only enhances the conductivity of PTCDA, but also increases the transport channel of ions, so as to increase the adsorption of sodium ions into the composite positive electrode. Therefore, the reversible capacity and cycle life of the composite electrode are significantly improved, which exhibit the excellent intercalation and de-intercalation performance for sodium ions and the charge-discharge rate performance.",Composites Part B: Engineering

Enabling stable sodium metal cycling by sodiophilic interphase in a polymer electrolyte system,"© 2021Enabling highly reversible sodium (Na) metal anodes in a polymer electrolyte (PE) system is critical for realizing next-generation batteries with lower cost, higher energy, and improved safety. However, the uneven Na deposition and high Na/PE interphase resistance lead to poor reversibility and short cycle life of Na metal anodes. To tackle these problems, here a variety of metal nanoparticles (M-np, M = Al, Sn, In or Au) are deposited onto copper (Cu) foils to synthesize binder-free M-np@Cu substrates for Na plating/stripping. Notably, the Au-np@Cu substrate provides abundant preferential nucleation/growth sites, decreasing Na nucleation barrier and thus promoting uniform Na deposition. Accordingly, stable Na metal anodes are achieved with high reversible capacities, long cycle life, and high usage of Na.

Review of electrochemical oxidation desulfurization for fuels and minerals,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdElectro-oxidation desulfurization uses reactive oxygen species (ROSs) from water electrolysis to strengthen the transition of sulfur-containing phase, enhancing the separation property between sulfur and fuel. In this process, the rate-determine step is considered as the precise contact between ROSs and sulfur. “Three transfers and two reactions” play critical roles in improving the contact, which are 1) the ROS precursor transfer, 2) transfer of ROSs, 3) transfer of sulfur, 4) the formation of ROSs, 5) the oxidation reaction between sulfur and ROSs. The synergy “three transfers and two reactions” can be improved by regulating the electrode structure and corresponding external field. Therefore, the enhancement of “three transfers and two reactions” can be designed from three aspects: 1) the design of electrolysis cell, 2) the regulation of electrolyte system, and 3) the design of electrode structures. In this review, we briefly introduced the mechanism of electro-oxidation desulfurization, and proposed key steps during electro-desulfurization and summarized development of approaches to enhance those key steps with emphasis on the bottlenecks in different sulfur phases. We also reviewed recent attractive progresses in the design of electrolyte and cells for improving the reactant solubility, which is very critical for heterogeneous reactions to realize large-scale industrial applications.",Fuel

Pseudo-copper Ni-Zn alloy catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction to C2 products,"© 2021, Higher Education Press.Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to obtain C2 products has drawn widespread attentions. Copper-based materials are the most reported catalysts for CO2 reduction to C2 products. Design of high-efficiency pseudo-copper catalysts according to the key characteristics of copper (Cu) is an important strategy to understand the reaction mechanism of C2 products. In this work, density function theory (DFT) calculations are used to predict nickel-zinc (NiZn) alloy catalysts with the criteria similar structure and intermediate adsorption property to Cu catalyst. The calculated tops of 3d states of NiZn3(001) catalysts are the same as Cu(100), which is the key parameter affecting the adsorption of intermediate products. As a result, NiZn3(001) exhibits similar adsorption properties with Cu(100) on the crucial intermediates *CO2, *CO and *H. Moreover, we further studied CO formation, CO hydrogenation and C-C coupling process on Ni-Zn alloys. The free energy profile of C2 products formation shows that the energy barrier of C2 products formation on NiZn3(001) is even lower than Cu(100). These results indicate that NiZn3 alloy as pseudo-copper catalyst can exhibit a higher catalytic activity and selectivity of C2 products during CO2RR. This work proposes a feasible pseudo-copper catalyst and provides guidance to design high-efficiency catalysts for CO2RR to C2 or multi-carbon products.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Frontiers of Physics

Understanding Sulfur Redox Mechanisms in Different Electrolytes for Room-Temperature Na–S Batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s).Abstract: This work reports influence of two different electrolytes, carbonate ester and ether electrolytes, on the sulfur redox reactions in room-temperature Na–S batteries. Two sulfur cathodes with different S loading ratio and status are investigated. A sulfur-rich composite with most sulfur dispersed on the surface of a carbon host can realize a high loading ratio (72% S). In contrast, a confined sulfur sample can encapsulate S into the pores of the carbon host with a low loading ratio (44% S). In carbonate ester electrolyte, only the sulfur trapped in porous structures is active via ‘solid–solid’ behavior during cycling. The S cathode with high surface sulfur shows poor reversible capacity because of the severe side reactions between the surface polysulfides and the carbonate ester solvents. To improve the capacity of the sulfur-rich cathode, ether electrolyte with NaNO3 additive is explored to realize a ‘solid–liquid’ sulfur redox process and confine the shuttle effect of the dissolved polysulfides. As a result, the sulfur-rich cathode achieved high reversible capacity (483 mAh g−1), corresponding to a specific energy of 362 Wh kg−1 after 200 cycles, shedding light on the use of ether electrolyte for high-loading sulfur cathode.

Aligned Carbon-Based Electrodes for Fast-Charging Batteries: A Review,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHFast-charging batteries have attracted great attention, and are anticipated to charge electrical vehicles and consumer electronics to full-capacity in several minutes. However, commercial electrode materials in batteries generally have a limited rate performance and are difficult to be used in fast-charging batteries. Designing electrodes with an aligned structure is an effective way to shorten the ion transport path and improve the rate performance of a battery. The excellent electronic conductivity of carbon-based electrodes is another key factor for increasing the rate capability of rechargeable batteries. Therefore, aligned carbon-based electrodes (ACBEs) can significantly improve the power density by combining the advantages of an aligned structure and carbon-based materials. In this review, the mechanism, advantages, and challenges of ACBEs for fast-charging batteries are evaluated, and then the design and preparation methods of ACBEs based on their different dimensions are summarized, and their applications in different batteries are illustrated. Finally, the future development of ACBEs for fast-charging batteries is considered.",Small

"A stable cathode-solid electrolyte composite for high-voltage, long-cycle-life solid-state sodium-ion batteries","© 2021, The Author(s).Rechargeable solid-state sodium-ion batteries (SSSBs) hold great promise for safer and more energy-dense energy storage. However, the poor electrochemical stability between current sulfide-based solid electrolytes and high-voltage oxide cathodes has limited their long-term cycling performance and practicality. Here, we report the discovery of the ion conductor Na3-xY1-xZrxCl6 (NYZC) that is both electrochemically stable (up to 3.8 V vs. Na/Na+) and chemically compatible with oxide cathodes. Its high ionic conductivity of 6.6 × 10−5 S cm−1 at ambient temperature, several orders of magnitude higher than oxide coatings, is attributed to abundant Na vacancies and cooperative MCl6 rotation, resulting in an extremely low interfacial impedance. A SSSB comprising a NaCrO2 + NYZC composite cathode, Na3PS4 electrolyte, and Na-Sn anode exhibits an exceptional first-cycle Coulombic efficiency of 97.1% at room temperature and can cycle over 1000 cycles with 89.3% capacity retention at 40 °C. These findings highlight the immense potential of halides for SSSB applications.",Nature Communications
Shuttle-effect-free sodium–sulfur batteries derived from a Tröger's base polymer of intrinsic microporosity,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries have recently gained attention as next-generation energy storage devices owing to their low cost, the abundance of sodium, and the high theoretical capacity of sulfur.

Textile-derived freestanding Fe3O4/Porous carbon cloth composite electrode for flexible Li-ion batteries with remarkable cycling stability,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The flexible substrates commonly used (carbon cloth, CNT film, graphene film) as a current collector provide negligible capacity, the complicated preparation process and high cost further limit its practicality. Herein, a flexible Fe3O4/porous carbon cloth composite electrode with controllable structure was successfully prepared by utilizing the unique dyeing technique and subsequent pyrolysis. The analysis of lithium storage contribution confirmed that the carbon cloth matrix provides 0.53 mAh cm−2 capacity at a high current density of 1 mA cm−2 because the carbon fibers were partly etched by Fe-base species. As we expected, this composite electrode delivers a high areal capacity of 1.53 mAh cm−2 at a high current density of 1 mA cm−2 after 100 cycles. The excellent performance can be ascribed to that the carbon coated Fe3O4 electrode possesses several advantages, including rendering an efficient electron/ion transport network, relieving the volume expansion of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and enabling superior kinetics with higher capacitive contribution. More importantly, the flexible electrodes with robust nature endow the pouch-cell with superior performance and excellent flexibility. In this regard, the low-cost and large-scale production methodology as well as the promising electrochemical results will bring a new dawn for the development of flexible electronic industry.",Applied Surface Science

Stable Cycling of Lithium Batteries Utilizing Iron Disulfide Nanoparticles,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Of the many factors that control whether a battery chemistry is realistic or not, the harmony between the anode and cathode is of the upmost importance. To design a lithium-based battery that utilizes conversion chemistry, any optimization of the anode or cathode must not sacrifice the performance of the other electrode. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate the application of synthesized FeS2 nanoparticles (npFeS2) as a cathode material specifically coupled with an optimized electrolyte for lithium metal cycling. Additionally, implementing a voltage-limited cycling protocol for this system produces a stable-cycling npFeS2-Li battery. Using a suite of spectroscopy and microscopy techniques, along with elemental and thermogravimetric analyses, we show that the FeS2 nanoparticles have the crystal structure of pyrite and contains less than 12 wt % ligand. Cycling of these nanoparticles in a lithium cell with a maximum charging voltage of 2.4 V shows a high average capacity of 421 mA h/g over 80 cycles. Furthermore, we show that uniform submicron FeS2 particles are essential for avoiding detrimental polysulfides, even with a 2.4 V limited charging voltage. Nanoparticle design, consideration of the electrolyte, and voltage conditions are the necessary steps for using FeS2 in practical energy-dense lithium batteries.",ACS Applied Nano Materials

In this work, the layered-like structure of TiO2-Ti3C2 Mxene was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. The prepared TiO2-Ti3C2 material possesses a better optimal structure, which showed the evenly dispersed TiO2 on the Ti3C2 (Ti3C2). The layered-like structure material combines the decrease of volume expansion and the high conductivity of Ti3C2. After being impregnated with sulfur, a significant specific capacity of 255.196 mA h/g was achieved after 1500 cycles at a 1 C-rate with a low-capacity decay.

Computational Auxiliary for the Progress of Sodium-Ion Solid-State Electrolytes,"© All-solid-state sodium batteries (ASSBs) have attracted ever-increasing attention due to their enhanced safety, high energy density, and the abundance of raw materials. One of the remaining key issues for the practical ASSB is the lack of good superionic and electrochemical stable solid-state electrolytes (SEs).

Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile as a High-Performance and Low-Volume Change Anode for Robust Potassium Storage,"© Potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) are considered as low-cost electrochemical energy storage technologies because of the abundant potassium resources. However, the practical applications of KIBs are mainly hampered by the unsatisfactory electrochemical performance of anode materials which often undergo large volume variations during potassiation-depotassiation, limiting their cycling life. Here, low-cost sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (S-PAN) is reported as an attractive anode candidate for KIBs. It provides a high potassium storage capacity of 569 mAh g(S-PAN)-1 with decent rate capability and cycling stability (no capacity loss after 1500 cycles, running time ∼188 days). Detailed ex situ spectroscopic and in situ microscopic characterizations reveal that the distinguished electrochemical performance of S-PAN is attributed to the high reversibility of its covalent C-S and S-S bonds which undergo repeated cleavage-redimerization during potassiation-depotassiation concomitant with relatively small volume variation (less than 24.2%). Subsequently, a full-cell constructed by pairing high-voltage K2MnFe(CN)6 cathode with high-capacity S-PAN anode demonstrates an attractive energy density (290.9 Wh kg-1) and long-term cycling stability (1200 cycles with 95.4% capacity retention). Given the high performance and low cost of both anode and cathode materials, it is believed that the present full-cell promises it as a competitive energy storage system for the cost-sensitive grid-scale applications",ACS Nano

Challenges and key parameters in exploring the cyclability limitation of practical lithium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have become the most promising candidates for next-generation power storage technologies owing to their ultrahigh energy density and low cost. However, practical Li-S batteries, operated under harsh conditions with high sulfur loading, low electrolyte-to-sulfur (E/S) ratio and low negative-to-positive capacity ratio (N/P), are significantly impeded by several inherent drawbacks, including the shuttle effect of polysulfide intermediates, short lifespan, and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we systematically summarize and analyze the cyclability of Li-S batteries with an areal capacity over 5 mA h cm−2, and particularly pay great attention to the key parameters of high-sulfur-loading cathodes tested under lowE/Sratio (E/S≤5 μL mg−1) andN/Pratio (N/P≤5) circumstances to point out key strategies for the optimization of electrochemical performance. We clarify the development roadmap, analyze related scientific challenges, standardize the electrochemical test conditions of practical sulfur cathodes and uncover the cyclability limits to promote the industrialized process of lithium-sulfur batteries. We systematically summarize the current Li-S pouch batteries with considerable performance under practical conditions and also emphasize the failure mechanism analysis. Consequently, this review not only provides various thresholds of electrochemical properties in both coin cells and pouch cells but also offers feasible devices to facilitate practical and commercial applications of lithium-sulfur batteries in the near future.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

However, the lack of high-performance sodium anode materials limits the commercialization of SIBs. In this work, the dual enhancement of SnS2/graphene anodes in sodium storage is achieved through S-compositing and Co doping via an innovative one-step hydrothermal reaction at a relatively low temperature of 120 °C. The as-prepared 7% Co-SnS2/S@r-G composite consisting of 15.4 wt % S and 1.49 atom % Co shows both superior cycling stability (over 1000 cycles) and rate capability, giving high reversible specific capacities of 878, 608, and 470 mAh g-1 at 0.2, 5, and 10 A g-1, respectively. More encouragingly, the full-cell also exhibits an outstanding long-term cycling performance under 0.5 A g-1, which delivers a reversible capacity of 500 mAh g-1 over 200 cycles and still retains a high reversible capacity of 432 mAh g-1 over 400 cycles. The enhancement mechanism is attributed to the favorable three-dimensional structure of the composite, Co doping, and S-composition, which can induce a synergistic effect.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
"Atomically Dispersed and O, N-Coordinated Mn-Based Catalyst for Promoting the Conversion of Polysulfides in Li2S-Based Li-S Battery","© 2021 American Chemical Society.Nowadays, Li-S batteries are facing many thorny challenges like volume expansion and lithium dendrites on the road to commercialization. Due to the peculiarity of complete lithiation and the capability to match non-lithium anodes, Li2S-based Li-S batteries have attracted more and more attention. Nevertheless, the same notorious shuttle effect of polysulfides as in traditional Li-S batteries and the poor conductivity of Li2S lead to sluggish conversion reaction kinetics, poor Coulombic efficiency, and cycling performance. Herein, we propose the interconnected porous carbon skeleton as the host, which is modified by an atomically dispersed Mn catalyst as well as O, N atoms (named as ON-MnPC) via the melt salt method, and introduce the Li2S nanosheet into the carbon host with poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) ethanol solution. It has been found that the introduction of O, N to bind with Mn atoms can endow the nonpolar carbon surface with ample unsaturated coordination active sites, restrain the shuttle effect, and enhance the diffusion of Li+ and accelerate the conversion reaction kinetics. Besides, due to the ultra-high catalyst activity of atomically dispersed Mn catalysts, the Li2S/ON-MnPC cathode shows good electrochemical performance, e.g., an initial capacity of 534 mAh g-1, a capacity of 514.18 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles, a high retention rate of 96.23%, and a decay rate of 0.04% per cycle. Hence, use of atomically dispersed Mn catalysts to catalyze the chemical conversion reactions of polysulfides from multiple dimensions is a significant exploration, and it can provide a brand-new train of thought for the development and commercialization of the economical, high-performance Li2S-based Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

High ionic conductivity and stable phase Na11.5Sn2Sb0.5Ti0.5S12 for all-solid-state sodium batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The quaternary antimony (Sb)-based sulfide sodium solid electrolyte Na11Sn2SbS12 with good moisture stability is attractive for practical application in all-solid-state sodium batteries. However, the Na11Sn2SbS12 exhibits low room temperature ionic conductivity and it is difficult to obtain pure phase due to the limited solubility of Sb in the Na11Sn2SbS12 crystal structure. Herein, titanium (Ti)-doping Na11+xSn2Sb1-xTixS12 (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) materials are systematically investigated, and the highest room temperature ionic conductivity of 1.01 mS cm−1 is achieved when x = 0.5 (Na11.5Sn2Sb0.5Ti0.5S12), which is 3 times higher than that of pristine Na11Sn2SbS12. X-ray diffraction and alternating current impedance analyses reveal that the substitution of Sb with Ti can prevent the formation of the NaSbS2 impurity, determining high ionic conductivity. Meanwhile, the Na11.5Sn2Sb0.5Ti0.5S12 demonstrates good air stability with limited H2S gas evolution. Besides, the activation energy, electronic conductivity and electrochemistry stability window for Na11.5Sn2Sb0.5Ti0.5S12 are also evaluated.

Investigation on the Structure and Properties of Na3.1Zr1.55Si2.3P0.7O11as a Solid Electrolyte and Its Application in a Seawater Battery,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.The ionic conductivity, bend strength, and electrochemical performance in a seawater battery (SWB) of an Na3.1Zr1.55Si2.3P0.7O11 (vA-NASICON) solid electrolyte were compared to those of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (H-NASICON). vA-NASICON exhibited three times higher total ionic conductivity (8.6 × 10-4 S/cm) than H-NASICON (2.9 × 10-4 S/cm). This is due to the higher bulk ionic conductivity and lower grain boundary resistance of vA-NASICON. The higher bulk conductivity of vA-NASICON is a result of its higher Na content, leading to a larger concentration of charge carriers and/or the formation of a higher conductive rhombohedral phase. The lower grain boundary resistance of vA-NASICON is a result of its larger grain size and reduced ZrO2 content. The bend strength of vA-NASICON (95 MPa) was 30% higher than that of the H-NASICON ceramic. The higher bend strength of vA-NASICON was attributed to its reduced ZrO2 secondary phase (1.1 vol %) compared to that of H-NASICON (2.6 vol %). When the vA-NASICON ceramic was tested in the SWB as a solid electrolyte, an 8.27% improved voltage efficiency and 81% higher power output were demonstrated, compared to those of H-NASICON, as a result of its higher total ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. At the same time, the vA-NASICON membrane revealed comparable cycle life (1000 h) to that of H-NASICON. These results suggest that vA-NASICON can be a better alternative than H-NASICON for use in the SWB.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Identifying the Evolution of Selenium-Vacancy-Modulated MoSe2 Precatalyst in Lithium–Sulfur Chemistry,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHWitnessing compositional evolution and identifying the catalytically active moiety of electrocatalysts is of paramount importance in Li–S chemistry. Nevertheless, this field remains elusive. We report the scalable salt-templated synthesis of Se-vacancy-incorporated MoSe2 architecture (SeVs-MoSe2) and reveal the phase evolution of the defective precatalyst in working Li–S batteries. The interaction between lithium polysulfides and SeVs-MoSe2 is probed to induce the transformation from SeVs-MoSe2 to MoSeS. Furthermore, operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ X-ray diffraction measurements in combination with theoretical simulations verify that the effectual MoSeS catalyst could help promote conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S, thereby boosting the capacity performance. The Li–S battery accordingly exhibits a satisfactory rate and cycling capability even with and elevated sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions (7.67 mg cm−2; 4.0 μL mg−1S).

Synthetic control over polymorph formation in the d-band semiconductor system FeS2,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Pyrite, also known as fool's gold is the thermodynamic stable polymorph of FeS2. It is widely considered as a promising d-band semiconductor for various applications due to its intriguing physical properties. Marcasite is the other naturally occurring polymorph of FeS2. Measurements on natural crystals have shown that it has similarly promising electronic, mechanical, and optical properties as pyrite. However, it has been only scarcely investigated so far, because the laboratory-based synthesis of phase-pure samples or high quality marcasite single crystal has been a challenge until now. Here, we report the targeted phase formationviahydrothermal synthesis of marcasite and pyrite. The formation condition and phase purity of the FeS2polymorphs are systematically studied in the form of a comprehensive synthesis map. We, furthermore, report on a detailed analysis of marcasite single crystal growth by a space-separated hydrothermal synthesis. We observe that single phase product of marcasite forms only on the surface under the involvement of H2S and sulphur vapor. The availability of high-quality crystals of marcasite allows us to measure the fundamental physical properties, including an allowed direct optical bandgap of 0.76 eV, temperature independent diamagnetism, an electronic transport gap of 0.11 eV, and a room-temperature carrier concentration of 4.14 × 1018cm−3. X-ray absorption/emission spectroscopy are employed to measure the band gap of the two FeS2phases. We find marcasite has a band gap of 0.73 eV, while pyrite has a band gap of 0.87 eV. Our results indicate that marcasite - that is now synthetically available in a straightforward fashion - is as equally promising as pyrite as candidate for various semiconductor applications based on earth abundant elements.",Chemical Science

However, its practical commercialization has been impeded by inherent drawbacks of notorious capacity decay, unsatisfied insulating nature, and sluggish conversion chemistry. To address these issues, for the first time, freestanding nanofibrous networks with hierarchical nanostructures are facilely constructed by inlaying electrocatalytic bimetallic chalcogenides (FexMn1-xS nanoparticles) into conductive graphene nanosheet (GN)-doped sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) fiber matrices. Covalent-bonded SPAN featuring an insoluble mechanism serves as a reliable cathode substrate with enhanced electrostability and high sulfur utilization, while high-surface-area GN dopants promote conductivity improvement and rapid electron transfer. Meanwhile, the results prove that sulfiphilic FexMn1-xS nanoparticles with abundant electrochemically active sites facilitate construction of uniform deposition interfaces and efficient electrocatalysis conversion toward lithium polysufides. This feasible catalytic-insoluble cathode strategy drives the Li-S battery, which exhibits excellent electrochemical performances with a remarkable reversible discharge capacity of 967 mA h g-1 and a capacity retention of 623 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles. Moreover, the corresponding lithiation/delithiation mechanisms are systematically investigated through complementary morphological and spectral analyses, providing valuable insights into advanced metal-sulfur batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
"Sub-zero and room-temperature sodium–sulfur battery cell operations: A rational current collector, catalyst and sulphur-host design and study","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Minimizing polysulfide-shuttling while using a high-sulfur loaded cathode is vital in the effort to realize practical room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries. Because of their inexpensive, highly abundant materials, these batteries have great potential as future, low-cost, stationary energy storage devices. The sluggish kinetics associated with the electrochemical conversion of electrolyte-soluble Na-polysulfides into insoluble final products causes a rapid accumulation of the intermediates in the electrolyte that escalates the polysulfide-shuttling. We report indium tin oxide nanoparticles decorated onto activated carbon cloth (ITO@ACC) as an electrocatalytic substrate that immobilizes the higher-order Na-polysulfides and also promotes their conversion into the insoluble end-discharge products and thus suppresses the accumulation of intermediate products in the electrolyte. The conversion into the insoluble end-discharge product is confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to be via a free-radical coupling mechanism. At 20 °C, the ITO@ACC-catalyzed sodium-sulfur batteries (6.8 mg(S) cm–2) gave an early cycle capacity of 684 mA h g(S)–1 and after 1000 cycles the capacity was maintained at 445 mA h g(S)–1 at a 0.5C rate. Moreover, a subzero-temperature sodium-sulfur battery is also realized for the first time; operating at –10 °C, the initial specific capacity of the battery operating at 0.1C at this temperature was 342 mA h g(S)–1 and after 100 cycles, the capacity was maintained at 310 mA h g(S)–1.",Energy Storage Materials

Among the various commercialized technologies, batteries have attracted enormous attention due to their relatively high energy density and long cycle life. Nevertheless, the limited supply and uneven distribution of lithium minerals, as well as their high cost, has greatly hindered the application of lithium-ion batteries in large-scale energy storage.

High sulfur content of mesoporous activated carbon composite derived from water hyacinth,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Cathode composites with high sulfur content have become a concern to develop because they can improve the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. The high sulfur content in the composite can be obtained from the carbon matrix, which has a high surface area and high electrical conductivity. Activated carbon made from biomass waste can be used as a carbon matrix due to its high surface area and ease of synthesis. In this study, activated carbon was prepared from water hyacinth (ACWH-600), which was carbonized at a temperature of 600 °C with a ZnCl2 activator. Activated-carbon–sulfur composite (ACWH-600/S) was synthesized by mixing activated carbon and sulfur in a ratio of 1:3. The characterizations performed for ACWH-600 and ACWH-600/S were N2 desorption–adsorption to determine the surface area, SEM to determine surface morphology, XRD to determine graphite structure, thermogravimetric analysis test to determine the sulfur content in the composite, and four-line probe conductivity to measure electrical conductivity at room temperature. The surface area, total pore volume, and pore diameter of ACWH were 642.39 m2 g−1, 0.714 cm3 g−1, and 2.22 nm, respectively, while the surface area, total pore volume, and pore diameter of ACWH-600/S were 29.431 m2 g−1, 0.038 cm3 g−1, and 2.54 nm. The conductivity value of ACWH-600 was 3.93 × 10−2 S/cm, while for ACWH-600/S, the conductivity value was 2.24 × 10−4 S/cm. The decrease in conductivity value after activated carbon added sulfur indicated the success of synthesizing a carbon matrix from water hyacinth with high sulfur content. The high sulfur content of 58 wt%, together with the acceptable conductivity value of composite ACWH-600/S, provide an opportunity to apply these composites as cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries.",Sustainability (Switzerland)

Pre-sodiation strategy for superior sodium storage batteries,"© 2021 The Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China, and Chemical Industry Press Co., LtdThe irreversible consumption of sodium in the initial several cycles greatly led to the attenuation of capacity, which caused the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and obvious poor cycle stability. Pre-sodiation can effectively improve the electrochemical performance by compensating the capacity loss in the initial cycle. Here, carbon-coated sodium-pretreated iron disulfide (NaFeS2@C) has been synthesized through conventional chemical method and used in sodium metal battery as a cathode material. The calculated density of states (DOS) of NaFeS2@C is higher, which implies enhanced electron mobility and improved cycle reversibility. Because of the highly reversible conversion reaction and the compensation of irreversible capacity loss during the initial cycle, the Na/NaFeS2@C battery achieves ultra-high initial coulombic efficiency (96.7%) and remarkable capacity (751 mA·h·g−1 at 0.1 A·g−1). In addition, highly reversible electrochemical reactions and ultra-thin NaF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) also benefit for the electrochemical performance, even at high current density of 100 A·g−1, it still exhibits a reversible capacity of 136 mA·h·g−1, and 343 mA·h·g−1 after 2500 cycles at 5.0 A·g−1.

Single Cobalt Atoms Decorated N-doped Carbon Polyhedron Enabled Dendrite-Free Sodium Metal Anode,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHUncontrollable growth of sodium dendrites during the sodium deposition and stripping processes remains a huge challenge for achieving high-performance sodium metal batteries (SMBs), which results in ineffective utilization of metallic Na, low Coulombic efficiency, and inferior cycling life. Here, a single Co atom uniformly decorated porous nitrogen-doped carbon polyhedron (CoSA@NC) matrix has been fabricated and introduced to control the Na growth and achieve uniform Na nucleation/deposition.

Augmenting metal leaching from copper anode slime by sulfuric acid in the presence of manganese(IV) oxide and graphite,"© 2021Copper anode slime (CAS) is a solid byproduct of copper electrorefining process, from which the recoveries of base metals (copper, nickel), high-value rare elements (tellurium, selenium) and precious metals (silver, gold) often witnessed problems because of the complexity of constituent phases in the slime. In the present study, a sulfuric acid leaching process in the presence of manganese(IV) oxide (MnO2) as oxidant and graphite as catalyst has been developed to augment metal recoveries from CAS. The leaching efficiencies of copper, nickel, tellurium, selenium and silver from CAS, and manganese from MnO2 achieved were 99.9%, 98.2%, 90.8%, 81.9%, 80.7%, and 84.1%, respectively, after leaching under the conditions: 2.0 M H2SO4 concentration, 90 °C temperature, 0.8/0.8/1 MnO2/graphite/CAS mass ratio and 6 h reaction time. These leaching efficiencies are higher than that in the absence of only graphite (99.8% Cu, 97.7% Ni, 76.8% Te, 69.4% Se, 67.2% Ag and 55.9% Mn), showing that graphite plays an important role to augment the leaching reactions. Negligible amount of Se and Ag leaching was noted without MnO2. The recyclability test of graphite showed that it can be recycled without loss of its catalytic performance. Thus, the process presented in this study shows good potential of sustainable metal recovery from CAS.",Hydrometallurgy

Sodium fluoride-rich solid electrolyte interphase for sodium–metal and sodium–oxygen batteries,"© 2021 Korean Chemical Society and Wiley-VCH GmbH.We studied solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on metallic sodium (Na) electrodes. Among sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6), sodium triflate (NaOTf), and sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) electrolytes, sodium fluoride (NaF)-rich and compact SEI was only formed by chemical reduction of NaPF6. Excellent rigidity and insolubility of NaF-rich SEI layer enhanced electrochemical cycling performances for both Na/Na symmetric cells and sodium–oxygen (Na–O2) cells. By contrast, the Na electrodes using NaOTf and NaTFSI formed porous and carbonaceous SEI layers rather than NaF. Soluble carbonaceous species were detached from the Na electrode, which led to the undesired decomposition of electrolyte solution. It resulted in the substantial formation of the dead Na and dendritic Na and caused cycling failure of Na–O2 cells within 10 cycles, demonstrated by NaOTf.",Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society

Recently, ultralow-concentration electrolytes (ULCEs) with 0.3 mol/L (M) NaPF6 are greatly attractive because of their low cost and high permeability. However, the cycle life and rate performance of SMBs in ULCEs are limited by the high reactivity of sodium metal anodes.

Theoretical and experimental results prove that BSTFA can scavenge HF and H2O in the NaPF6-based electrolyte spontaneously and inhibit the hydrolysis reaction of NaPF6. Owing to protective interface layers on sodium metal anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, the Na||NVP battery in 2% BSTFA-containing ULCE shows a high-capacity retention rate of 92.63% after 1955 cycles at 2 C and a superior rate capability of exceeding 105 mAh g−1 at 40 C.",Energy Storage Materials
Multiscale Understanding of Covalently Fixed Sulfur–Polyacrylonitrile Composite as Advanced Cathode for Metal–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHMetal–sulfur batteries (MSBs) provide high specific capacity due to the reversible redox mechanism based on conversion reaction that makes this battery a more promising candidate for next-generation energy storage systems. Recently, along with elemental sulfur (S8), sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN), in which active sulfur moieties are covalently bounded to carbon backbone, has received significant attention as an electrode material. Importantly, SPAN can serve as a universal cathode with minimized metal–polysulfide dissolution because sulfur is immobilized through covalent bonding at the carbon backbone. Considering these unique structural features, SPAN represents a new approach beyond elemental S8 for MSBs. However, the development of SPAN electrodes is in its infancy stage compared to conventional S8 cathodes because several issues such as chemical structure, attached sulfur chain lengths, and over-capacity in the first cycle remain unresolved. In addition, physical, chemical, or specific treatments are required for tuning intrinsic properties such as sulfur loading, porosity, and conductivity, which have a pivotal role in improving battery performance. This review discusses the fundamental and technological discussions on SPAN synthesis, physicochemical properties, and electrochemical performance in MSBs. Further, the essential guidance will provide research directions on SPAN electrodes for potential and industrial applications of MSBs.",Advanced Science

"SnSb binary alloy induced heterogeneous nucleation within the confined nanospace: Toward dendrite-free, flexible and energy/power dense sodium metal batteries","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Rechargeable sodium (Na) metal batteries (SMBs) provide an alternative energy-dense, low-cost energy storage system beyond prevailing Li‐ion technologies. However, their practical deployment requires the performance evaluation of Na anodes on the device level and mitigation of safety hazards, i.e., mechanical stress, electrode pulverization and dynamic interfacial properties. Here, we propose a lightweight N-doped carbon nanofiber substrate with SnSb nanocrystallites monodispersed within the mesopores (SnSb@NCNF). The alloying-induced Na15Sn4 and Na3Sb intermediates act as the heterogeneous sodiophilic “magnets” to homogenize Na ion flux and confine Na deposits within the nanospace. Additionally, the nucleation theory of metal solidification bridges the density functional theory calculations, elucidating the oriented Na propagation that maximizes the anode utilization. With the proper Na plating regulation, the SnSb@NCNF substrate (pre-stored 1 × excess Na) integrates with the NaVPO4F cathode in 5 mA h single-layer pouch cell, the prototype of which exhibits the cycling endurance (96.3% capacity retention for 500 cycles) and high specific energy/power densities even upon the repetitive mechanical flexing scenarios. The nanoconfinement of the heterogeneous nucleation process affords a feasible approach to mitigate the dendrite formation upon the geometry deformation or high areal-capacity loading, which enlightens the further exploration of the energy-dense, mechanical flexible battery system.",Energy Storage Materials
Laser-Induced Graphene Assisting Self-Conversion Reaction for Sulfur-Free Aqueous Cu-S Battery,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.In aqueous/nonaqueous metal-sulfur batteries, sulfur-based redox couple exhibits significant challenges mainly due to its low electrochemical kinetics, potential shuttle effect, and large volume change. Although massive researches have been conducted to optimize or replace metal anode and cathode composite, major challenges caused by the dependency on sulfur-based redox couple still remain. In this study, a novel redox couple of CuS/Cu2S, which provides the same theoretical capacity (based on conventional S/S2− redox couple) by changing the valence of ion charge carrier, is proposed. For achieving high reversibility, commercially viable laser-induced graphene (LIG) is fabricated and used for the first time in aqueous metal-sulfur batteries. By virtue of the synergism between novel redox couple and LIG, aqueous CuS/Cu2S battery delivers a highly reversible capacity of 1654.9 mAh g−1 in the initial cycle and retains 91.2% with 1509.5 mAh g−1 after 328 cycles. When being cycled at 2.8 A g−1, its reversible capacity still retains 92.1% after 410 cycles.

A β”-Alumina/Inorganic Ionic Liquid Dual Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Although sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries present the great prospects of high energy density, long cyclability, and sustainability, their deployment is heavily encumbered by safety, practicality, and versatility issues engendered by their high operating temperatures above 300 °C. Lowering the operating temperatures impedes the performance of Na–S batteries due to the formation of insulating S/polysulfides, diminished Na ion conduction in the β”-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE), the Na metal dendrite growth at temperatures below its melting point, and the shuttle effect occurring in the absence of the BASE. Herein, a Na–S battery that integrates a dual electrolyte consisting of the BASE and a novel inorganic ionic liquid is proposed for intermediate-temperature operations of 150 °C. Investigations reveal the ionic liquid to have high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and excellent thermal and chemical stability, making it propitious for intermediate-temperature operations. The high reversible capacity of 795 mAh (g-S)−1 at 0.1 mA (electrode area: 0.785 cm2) and an average capacity of 381 mAh (g-S)−1 achieved over 1000 cycles at 0.5 mA validate the use of ionic liquids in dual electrolyte systems to improve Na–S performance.",Advanced Functional Materials

However, SMBs suffer from challenging problems, such as low reversibility and dendrite growth during plating/stripping. In this work, we report that a non-flammable electrolyte with Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and 1,3,2-Dioxathiolane 2,2-dioxide (DTD) can in-situ generate a stable solid-electrolyte-interface (SEI) layer, which effectively suppresses the side reactions and prevents dendrite growth. This is attributed to the synergy of the multi-component of SEI layer including S-containing compounds (Na2S, Na2SO3 and organic S-containing salts), NaF and phosphate (Na3PO4). The DTD additive significantly promotes the stability and integrity of the formed SEI layer, which not only enables the dendrite-free Na plating/stripping with an average CE as high as 93.4% for 250 cycles, but also makes the Na||Na symmetric cell stable over more than 1350 h at 1 mAh cm−2 and 720 h even at 5 mAh cm−2.",Energy Storage Materials

Intrinsic low sodium/NASICON interfacial resistance paving the way for room temperature sodium-metal battery,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Sodium-metal batteries have strong potential to be utilized as stationary high energy density storage devices. Owing to its high ionic conductivity, low electronic conductivity and relatively easy fabrication, NASICON-structure electrolyte (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) is one of the potential candidates to be considered in the solid-state sodium-metal batteries at room temperature. However, the large interfacial resistance between the solid-state electrolyte and the metallic sodium is known to limit the critical current density (CCD) of the cell.

Covalent sulfur as stable anode for potassium ion battery,"© 2021 Science PressThe potassium bis(fluoro-sulfonyl)imide(KFSI)-based electrolyte has great application prospects in potassium ion batteries (PIBs). However, their development has been limited by the decomposition of electrolytes and the corrosion of Al foils (current collector) at high potential. Here, a N-doping, sulfur-rich chemically bonded porphyrin organic framework (SPOF) with a high potential plateau were synthesized as an anode to lower the redox potential of full cells and further inhibit the corrosion of Al foils. SPOF as anode delivers high reversible capacity (557 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1), excellent cycling performance (94% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 500 mA g−1), and superior rate performance. Meanwhile, the ex-situ FTIR, Raman, and HRTEM revealed the stability of N-doping and the reversible covalent sulfur and S–S bonds changes during potassiation/depotassiation. In addition, full cells using SPOF anode and PTCDA cathode showed outstanding performance (high capacity of 300 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1). And the Al current collector of the full cell was not corroded after 150 cycles. Yet, the Al foils with PTCDA as cathode were seriously corroded. This work provides a new strategy for realizing ultra-high reversible capacity and cyclic stability of PIBs, and also accelerates the process of early commercial application of PIBs.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

"Recent advances in semimetallic pnictogen (As, Sb, Bi) based anodes for sodium-ion batteries: Structural design, charge storage mechanisms, key challenges and perspectives","© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.In the recent times sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have come to the forefront as an economic and resourceful alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for powering portable electronic devices and large-scale grid storage. As the specific capacity, energy density and long cycle life of batteries depend upon the performance of anode materials; their quest is the ultimate need of the hour. Among the anode materials, the semimetallic pnictogens (As, Sb, Bi) and their compounds offer high gravimetric/volumetric capacities, but suffer from undesired volume expansion and inferior electrical conductivity. Herein, this paper reviews the recent progress in semimetallic pnictogens as alloying anodes and their compounds mainly as conversion-alloying anodes. Various debatable sodiation mechanisms (intercalation or alloying) have been presented with emphasis on in situ/ex situ advanced characterization methods well supported by theoretical modeling and calculations. The reviewed electrochemical reaction mechanisms, coherent structural designs and engineering provide a vital understanding of the electrochemical processes of Na+ ion storage. The existing challenges and perspectives are also presented, and several research directions are proposed from the aspects of special morphological design, employing conductive substrates, electrolyte additives and reducing particle size for technical and commercial success of SIBs.

A highly reversible sodium metal anode by mitigating electrodeposition overpotential,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Metallic sodium is considered the most likely anode material to replace metallic lithium owing to its high theoretical capacity, abundant reserves, and low cost. However, the uneven deposition and agglomerate deposition of Na often result in low coulombic efficiency and inferior lifetime during cycling. Here, by phosphorizing treatment, a sodiophilic phosphorized copper mesh (PCM) has been achieved as the metallic sodium-host current collector for the first time; then throughin situelectrochemical reaction construct, sodiophilic Na-Cu-P composite layer, which has a fast electronic/ionic conductivity and strong adsorption ability with sodium, thereby greatly mitigating electrodeposition overpotential for improving Na plating/stripping behaviors. Meanwhile, the cross-linked mesh skeleton significantly diminishes the local current density, thus achieving highly reversible Na plating/stripping behavior with dendrite-free and “dead Na”-free. Consequently, the PCM electrode can maintain a high coulombic efficiency (∼99.96%) over 1000 cycles at 5 mA cm−2and exhibit an ultra-low electrodeposition overpotential from 0.5 mA cm−2to 10 mA cm−2in a half-cell. Similarly, the symmetrical cell displays superior cycling stability with low overpotential. Furthermore, the PCM@Na anode delivers excellent cycling/rate performance when paired with Prussian blue (PB) cathode in full-cell.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Oxazine Ring-Substituted 4th Generation Benzoxazine Monomers & Polymers: Stereoelectronic Effect of Phenyl Substituents on Thermal Properties,"© Oxazine ring-substituted benzoxazine monomers inherit a smart architecture to cater intriguing properties offered by this upcoming latest generation of polybenzoxazines. It is therefore encouraging to study the regio-effect of oxazine ring substitution on ROP (ring-opening polymerization) temperature, thermal stability of the monomers and polymers to guide future designing of structures. Herein, we report a systematic analysis on the thermal properties with variation in the number and position of substituent (2- and/or 4-) in phenyl-substituted benzoxazines. Successful syntheses of monomers and structural characterization were confirmed using 1D NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), HRMS (high-resolution mass spectrometry), and XRD (X-ray diffraction). Polymerization behavior and thermal stability was studied by DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectroscopy, and TGA (thermogravimetry analysis). In-depth structural analysis by 2D NMR [1H - 1H COSY (correlation spectroscopy), 1H - 13C HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum correlation), and HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond correlation)] experiments, crystal data, TGA-GC-MS (thermogravimetry analysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), and DFT (density functional theory) calculation provided mechanistic insights of the effect of substitution on thermal behavior of monomers. It is found that besides the molecular mass of monomers and intermediates, the stereo-electronic effect of substituents at the 2- and/or 4-positions governs both the evaporation of monomer/cleaved intermediates and ring-opening reaction. Activation energy (Ea) of polymerization depends upon the position and degree of phenyl substituent(s). Among the studied varieties, the 2,4-substituted benzoxazine monomer showed the lowest ROP temperature with the least mass-loss during polymerization, the lowest Ea value of polymerization. Additionally, the resultant 2,4-substituted polybenzoxazine showed the highest thermal stability and char yield. An astute choice of selective positioning of groups in the oxazine ring can be a guiding principle for the structural designing of monomers to advocate a wide variety of applications.",Macromolecules

All rights reserved.To accelerate the commercial implementation of high-energy batteries, recent research thrusts have turned to the practicality of Si-based electrodes. Although numerous nanostructured Si-based materials with exceptional performance have been reported in the past 20 years, the practical development of high-energy Si-based batteries has been beset by the bias between industrial application with gravimetrical energy shortages and scientific research with volumetric limits.

Critical appraisals of recent advances in microscale design of stable Si-based materials are presented, including interfacial tailoring of Si microscale electrode, surface modification of SiOx microscale electrode, and structural engineering of hierarchical microscale electrode. Thereafter, other practical metrics beyond active material are also explored, such as robust binder design, electrolyte exploration, prelithiation technology, and thick-electrode engineering. Finally, we provide a roadmap starting with material design and ending with the remaining challenges and integrated improvement strategies toward Si-based full cells.",ACS Nano
Porous Heteroatom-Doped Ti3C2TxMXene Microspheres Enable Strong Adsorption of Sodium Polysulfides for Long-Life Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© The practical application of Na-S batteries is largely hindered by their low mass loading, inferior rate capability, and poor cycling performance. Herein, we report a design strategy for encapsulation of sodium polysulfides using Ti3C2Tx MXene. Porous nitrogen-doped Ti3C2Tx MXene microspheres have been synthesized by a facile synthesis method.

Designing 2D nickel hydroxide@graphene nanosheet composites to confine sulfur in highly stable lithium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The major challenge of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) is the ''shuttle effect'' of polysulfides. Herein, nickel hydroxide@graphene (Ni(OH)2@GR) is synthesized as a sulfur carrier by a simple refluxing method to efficiently confine sulfur for highly stable LSBs. The two-dimensional (2D) vertical arrays of Ni(OH)2 with extensive hydrophilic hydroxyl groups endow the cathode with powerful restriction and strong chemisorption ability of polysulfides. Besides, the typical 2D GR sheets provide a stable barrier for polysulfides and further accelerate the electron/ion migration transmission. Based on the Ni(OH)2@GR sheet-to-sheet heterostructure, the electrodes achieve 72% sulfur loading and exhibit outstanding long-term cycling stability with a decay rate of only 0.002% per cycle at 1C for 500 cycles.

Powering lithium-sulfur batteries by ultrathin sulfurized polyacrylonitrile nanosheets,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is a promising cathode material for stable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries due to its shuttle-free redox mechanism. However, the redox kinetics of SPAN needs to be enhanced to improve Li-S batteries. Herein, a salt-templating method is proposed for the fabrication of ultrathin SPAN nanosheets, which can afford a large contact area with the electrolyte and shorten the transport paths of electrons/ions involved in the reaction. In situ Raman analysis confirms the reversible breaking and formation of C-S/S-S bonds in SPAN nanosheets during cycling while ex situ SEM reveals the formation of lithium sulfide particles on the surface of SPAN nanosheets at the end of discharge. At a high current density of 2 A g-1, coin cells based on a SPAN nanosheet cathode can deliver a reversible capacity of 408 mA h g-1composite over 100 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 95%. Meanwhile, pouch cells using a SPAN nanosheet cathode exhibit a capacity retention rate close to 100% after 100 cycles at the same current density. These results herald a new approach for powering Li-S batteries by the nanoscale design of the SPAN cathode. This journal is",Nanoscale
A review of size engineering-enabled electrocatalysts for Li-S chemistry,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Li-S batteries (LSBs) have received extensive attention owing to their remarkable theoretical capacity (1672 mA h g−1) and high energy density (2600 W h kg−1), which are far beyond those of the state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries (LIBs).

Ni@Ni3N Embedded on Three-Dimensional Carbon Nanosheets for High-Performance Lithium/Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are recognized as one of the most promising next-generation energy storage devices, but their practical application is greatly limited by several obstacles, such as the highly insulating nature and sluggish redox kinetics of sulfur and the dissolution of lithium polysulfides. Herein, three-dimensional carbon nanosheet frameworks anchored with Ni@Ni3N heterostructure nanoparticles (denoted Ni@Ni3N/CNS) are designed and fabricated by a chemical blowing and thermal nitridation strategy. It is demonstrated that the Ni@Ni3N heterostructure can effectively accelerate polysulfide conversion and promote the chemical trapping of polysulfides. Meanwhile, the carbon nanosheet frameworks of Ni@Ni3N/CNS establish a highly conductive network for fast electron transportation. The cells with Ni@Ni3N heterostructures as the catalyst in the cathode show excellent electrochemical performance, revealing stable cycling over 600 cycles with a low-capacity fading rate of 0.04% per cycle at 0.5 C and high-rate capability (594 mAh g-1 at 3 C). Furthermore, Ni@Ni3N/CNS can also work well in room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries, delivering a high specific capacity (454 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles at 0.5 C).

Intrinsic defects promote rapid conversion of polysulfides on carbon surface to achieve high rate performance,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdPolysulfides can be captured rapidly by defects, which possess strong catalytic redox abilities. Species of defects have important influence on rate performance of metal-sulfur electrodes. However, catalytic reaction mechanisms have not been explored in depth. This paper focuses on comparing differences between intrinsic defect carbon materials (IDC) and external introduced defect carbon materials (EIDC) in promoting polysulfide redox abilities and exploring catalytic redox reaction mechanism deeply. Results show that IDC have stronger catalytic redox reaction abilities than EIDC, which is mainly due to stable C–S bonds on surface of IDC. After cycling, C–S bond contents in IDC electrodes maintain more than 70 %. During cycling process, C–S bonds can quickly adsorb polysulfides and promote their conversion into final products, thereby achieving high rate performance. Weak catalytic redox abilities of EIDC electrodes is mainly due to loss of C–S bonds. When the current density is 5C, capacities of IDC electrodes is twice as much as that of EIDC electrodes. Good rate performance of IDC electrodes reflects important roles of stable C–S bonds in promoting redox reaction of polysulfides, which has important research significance for preparation of carbon-based composite electrodes.",Carbon
Diphenyl guanidine vulcanization accelerators enable sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode for high capacity and ether-compatible by fast kinetic,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdSulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathode shows excellent electrochemical performance in carbonate electrolyte for lithium-sulfur batteries. However, the limited redox conversion rate of SPAN cathode in ether electrolyte would lead to high solubility of the intermediate polysulfide Li2Sn(n ≤ 4) and shuttling, resulting in a low performance of corresponding lithium-sulfur battery, even though ether-based electrolytes are more suitable in terms of Li metal anode. In addition, SPAN is comparatively lower sulfur loading (<50 wt%) reduced its value. Improving the sulfur loading and accelerate the redox conversion of SPAN to be compatible with ether electrolyte will be one of the most promising cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries. Here, we introduced a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode (SPAN-DG) with high sulfur loading (52 wt%) and high conductivity prepared by diphenylguanidine as vulcanization accelerator into lithium-sulfur battery based on ether electrolyte. This study found that SPAN-DG cathode with high conductivity can fast reaction kinetics and successfully inhibit the dissolution of lithium polysulfide and shuttle in ether electrolytes, shows good electrochemical performance.

"Interfacing 2D M2X (M = Na, K, Cs; X = O, S, Se, Te) monolayers for 2D excitonic and tandem solar cells","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.High photovoltaic efficiency with a staggered type II band alignment has been found in the heterobilayers of relatively less explored dialkali metal oxides and chalcogenides, using DFT-D3 and HSE06 functional. Out of all the type II van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures which are possible through a combination of any two individual monolayers stacked on top of one another, K2O/Cs2O, K2S/Cs2S, and K2Se/Cs2S heterobilayers are found to exhibit a high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.56%, 19.31%, and 16.43% respectively along with high carrier mobility (>104 cm2/V.s) and high visible light absorption coefficient (α ~ 105 cm−1). Therefore, these heterobilayers will be highly useful in photovoltaic applications. The PCE in the tandem solar cells comprising of the wider band gap, Na2Te/K2Se, in the top cell, and the narrower bandgap, K2O/Cs2O, in the bottom cell, is observed to reach close to 30%. The binding energies in K2O/Cs2O, K2S/Cs2S, and K2Se/Cs2S heterobilayers are found to be −36.38, −28.99, and −29.52 meV/Å2 at the interlayer layer distance of 3.30 Å, 2.75 Å, and 4.0 Å respectively, at equilibrium.

Chromium doping into NASICON-structured Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode for high-power Na-ion batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is characterized by a robust 3D structural framework and a high operating potential; these properties have enabled it to be widely studied as a stable and high-energy density cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In the present study, we designed a Na3V1.6Cr0.4(PO4)3/C (NVCrP@C) cathode by implanting Cr into the crystal structure of NVP and simultaneously coating the surface of NVP with carbon for realizing high power density SIBs. The substitution of Cr to vanadium in the NVP structure significantly enhanced the structural stability of the electrode while the uniform and thin carbon layer improved the electrical conductivity. Interestingly, the NVCrP@C cathode showed high electrochemical activities with multiple V3+/4+/5+ redox reactions triggered by Cr3+ substitution in a wide voltage range (2.5–4.1 V). Consequently, the NVCrP@C cathode delivered excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles even at 15C-rate and power capability up to 70 C-rate. Results from the in-situ X-ray diffraction and ex-situ X-ray absorption near edge structure studies were combined to verify the detailed mechanism of the enhanced sodium storage in the NVCrP@C cathode.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Novel Lithium-Sulfur Polymer Battery Operating at Moderate Temperature,"© 2021 The Authors. ChemElectroChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbHA safe lithium-sulfur (Li−S) battery employs a composite polymer electrolyte based on a poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDME) solid at room temperature. The electrolyte membrane enables a stable and reversible Li−S electrochemical process already at 50 °C, with low resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interphase and fast Li+ transport. The relatively low molecular weight of the PEGDME and the optimal membrane composition in terms of salts and ceramic allow a liquid-like Li−S conversion reaction by heating at moderately high temperature, still holding the solid-like polymer state of the cell. Therefore, the electrochemical reaction of the polymer Li−S cell is characterized by the typical dissolution of lithium polysulfides into the electrolyte medium during discharge and the subsequent deposition of sulfur at the electrode/electrolyte interphase during charge. On the other hand, the remarkable thermal stability of the composite polymer electrolyte (up to 300 °C) suggests a lithium-metal battery with safety content significantly higher than that using the common, flammable liquid solutions. Hence, the Li−S polymer battery delivers at 50 °C and 2 V a stable capacity approaching 700 mAh gS−1, with a steady-state coulombic efficiency of 98 %. These results suggest a novel, alternative approach to achieve safe, high-energy batteries with solid polymer configuration.",ChemElectroChem

Using a Chloride-Free Magnesium Battery Electrolyte to Form a Robust Anode-Electrolyte Nanointerface,"© Magnesium bis(hexamethyldisilazide) (Mg(HMDS)2)-based electrolytes are compelling candidates for rechargeable magnesium batteries due to their high compatibility with magnesium metal anode. However, the usual combination of Mg(HMDS)2 with chloride salts limits their practical application due to severe corrosion of cell components and low anodic stability.

However, the corrosion problems coupled with dendrite growth in an aqueous system severely limit the potential use of zinc storage systems with long service life. To delicately address the above obstacles, a κ-carrageenan/polyacrylamide/Zn(CF3SO3)2 hydrogel electrolyte (denoted as κ-CG/PAAm/Zn(CF3SO3)2) with an ionically and covalently double crosslinked network was constructed, which possesses a high ionic conductivity of 2.3 S m-1, a high tensile strength of 34.6 kPa with a superior stretchability of 599.0%, and an excellent compression strength of 75.3 kPa at 75.0% strain. The double crosslinked polymer chains realize uniform zinc deposition. In addition, the intrinsic hydrophilic groups in the κ-carrageenan (κ-CG) and polyacrylamide (PAAm) chains can well immobilize water molecules, which favor electrolyte ion transport. Moreover, nitrogen and sulphur co-doped carbon nanosheets (denoted as ACNS) characterized by the rich amorphous phase associated with lots of short-range ordered microcrystalline regions were prepared as the cathode material in this work, which exhibits a high capacity of 116.4 mA h g-1 coupled with superior rate performance and long-term cycling stability (108.0% capacity retention over 10 000 cycles) for an aqueous Zn//ACNS ZHSC.

Published by American Chemical Society.The more apparent specific heat release at a lower high-temperature decomposition (HTD) temperature of ammonium perchlorate (AP) poses a challenge for the development of highly active catalysts. In this work, a well-designed cobalt-embedded N-doped porous graphitized carbon (Co@NC) catalyst is obtained by high-temperature calcination of a zeolite imidazolate frameworks-67 precursor, in which the cobalt catalytic active center realizes effective nanoscale dispersion; meanwhile, the cobalt and N-doped porous graphitized carbon can release considerable heat after oxidation, and the cobalt oxides have an excellent catalytic effect on reducing the HTD temperature of AP. The catalytic activity of Co@NC was tested by a differential thermal analytical method. The results indicated that the HTD peak of AP was significantly decreased by 100.5 °C, the apparent activation energy of the HTD reaction of AP was reduced by 82.0 kJ mol-1, and the heat release compared with pure AP increased 2.9 times. On teh basis of these findings, Co@NC is expected to be one of the best candidate materials for AP thermal decomposition.",ACS Omega
Effect of current density on Ni-W coatings of SS316L current collectors for Na-S batteries,"© 2021 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.In this study, we investigated the effects of current density on the behavior of an amorphous Ni-W coating on a stainless steel 316 L (SS316L) surface. The performances of the Ni-W coatings and SS316L were studied though SEM, XRD and four-probe resistance tester. The corrosion resistance of the coatings was determined through static corrosion tests in a sulfur environment at 350 C. The amorphous Ni-W coating at different current densities slowed the corrosion rate and improved the conductivity of the SS316L current collector. At a current density of 15 A•dm-2, the crystal structure of the Ni -W coating was densest. The corrosion rate of the coating was 0.0856 mm•y-1, which was lower than that of SS316L (0.5123 mm•y-1) after 72 h in a 350 C molten sulfur environment, and the block resistance was 0.3312 mΩ, which was also lower than that of SS316L (0.3825 mΩ).",Materials Research Express

The weight changes were in good agreement with the theoretical values estimated by considering pure I− ion migration. Furthermore, the iodine element appeared at the anode, and the iodine concentration at the cathode decreased after electrolysis, indicating that the migrating species was only I−. This is the first study to elucidate the conduction of iodide ions in solids.",Science Advances
Reduced graphene-oxide-encapsulated mos2 /carbon nanofiber composite electrode for high-performance na-ion batteries,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been increasingly studied due to sodium (Na) being an inexpensive ionic resource (Na) and their battery chemistry being similar to that of current lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, SIBs have faced substantial challenges in developing high-performance anode materials that can reversibly store Na+ in the host structure. To address these challenges, molybdenum sulfide (MoS2 )-based active materials have been considered as promising anodes, owing to the two-dimensional layered structure of MoS2 for stably (de)inserting Na+ . Nevertheless, intrinsic issues of MoS2 —such as low electronic conductivity and the loss of active S elements after a conversion reaction—have limited the viability of MoS2 in practical SIBs. Here, we report MoS2 embedded in carbon nanofibers encapsulated with a reduced graphene oxide (MoS2 @CNFs@rGO) composite for SIB anodes. The MoS2 @CNFs@rGO delivered a high capacity of 345.8 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 for 90 cycles. The CNFs and rGO were synergistically taken into account for providing rapid pathways for electrons and preventing the dissolution of S sources during repetitive conversion reactions. This work offers a new point of view to realize MoS2-based anode materials in practical SIBs.",Nanomaterials
An in-situ catalytic-insoluble strategy enabled by sulfurized polyacrylonitrile-based composite cathode for potassium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.Owing to the insoluble organosulfur mechanism and stable cycling life, sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) developed as a promising cathode material for high-energy potassium-sulfur batteries (KSBs). However, it is yet a major challenge to achieve fast catalytic kinetics and high reversible capacity in SPAN-based cathodes. Here, one-step electrospun SPAN nanofibers embedded with FexNbyO metal oxide nanoparticles (FeNb@SPAN) have been successfully developed to construct sulfur electrodes with high electrochemical activity, high sulfur utilization, and high cycling stability. The as-prepared freestanding FeNb@SPAN composite cathode, which featuring interwoven nanofibers with FexNbyO nanoparticles homogeneously implanted, possesses high storage space for volume expansion and suppresses polysulfide dissolution during potassiation/depotassiation. Benefiting from its unique structure and composition in electrode design, the FeNb@SPAN cathode is endowed with outstanding energy storage performances with a high initial specific capacity of 776 mAh. g-1 under 50 mA. g-1 and an excellent cycling capability of 201 mAh. g-1 after 80 charge/discharge processes.

Ultra-Stable Cycling of High Capacity Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries Based on Sulfurated Poly(acrylonitrile),"© 2021 The Authors. Batteries & Supercaps published by Wiley-VCH GmbHWe report on a room temperature (RT) sodium-sulfur (Na−S) battery based on a sodium anode, a sulfurated poly(acrylonitrile) (SPAN) cathode and an electrolyte containing sodium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy) borate (Na[B(hfip)4]; hfip=hexafluoroisopropoxide) in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). The hfip anion as a weakly coordinating anion (WCA) provides high anodic stability, high ionic conductivity, and superior electrochemical performance in carbonate-based solvents. The Na-SPAN cell exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1360 (Formula presented.) and a remarkable reversible capacity of 1072 (Formula presented.) after 1000 cycles at 3 C (C=C-rate, 5.025 (Formula presented.)) with an insignificant average capacity decay of less than 0.021 % per cycle. A careful choice of the discharge cut-off potential (DCP) reveals that a DCP of 0.2 V allows for stable cycling for more than 500 cycles while a DCP of 0.5 V results in a constant capacity decay. The excellent cycle stability at a DCP of 0.2 V is likely to be caused by the high conversion of the SPAN-bound sulfur into Na2S.",Batteries and Supercaps

Growth mechanism of micro/nano metal dendrites and cumulative strategies for countering its impacts in metal ion batteries: A review†,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Metal‐ion batteries are capable of delivering high energy density with a longer lifespan. However, they are subject to several issues limiting their utilization. One critical impediment is the budding and extension of solid protuberances on the anodic surface, which hinders the cell functionalities. These protuberances expand continuously during the cyclic processes, extending through the separator sheath and leading to electrical shorting. The progression of a protrusion relies on a number of in situ and ex situ factors that can be evaluated theoretically through modeling or via laboratory experimentation. However, it is essential to identify the dynamics and mechanism of protrusion outgrowth. This review article explores recent advances in alleviating metal dendrites in battery systems, specifically alkali metals. In detail, we address the challenges associated with battery breakdown, including the underlying mechanism of dendrite generation and swelling. We discuss the feasible solutions to mitigate the dendrites, as well as their pros and cons, highlighting future research directions. It is of great importance to analyze dendrite suppression within a pragmatic framework with synergy in order to discover a unique solution to ensure the viability of present (Li) and future‐generation batteries (Na and K) for commercial use.",Nanomaterials
Recent Advances of Catalytic Effects in Cathode Materials for Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Electrocatalysts in room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na/S) have captured numerous attention. But, they suffered from shuttle effect and surface passivation. RT-Na/S show inferior energy-storage abilities, ascribed to the larger radii of Na-ions. Herein, the vigorous review is displayed from different kinds of metal-based traits, containing single metal, metal-based samples, and multifunctional hybrids. Through the controlling of structures and composition, the conversion reaction about liquid/solid phases would be enhanced, accompanied by the enhancements of cycling stabilities and rate properties, which enables the break-through of practical applications.

Grain Boundary Design of Solid Electrolyte Actualizing Stable All-Solid-State Sodium Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHAdvanced inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) are critical for all-solid-state alkaline metal batteries with high safety and high energy densities. A new interphase design to address the urgent interfacial stability issues against all-solid-state sodium metal batteries (ASSMBs) is proposed. The grain boundary phase of a Mg2+-doped Na3Zr2Si2PO12 conductor (denoted as NZSP-xMg) is manipulated to introduce a favorable Na3−2δMgδPO4-dominant interphase which facilitates its intimate contact with Na metal and works as an electron barrier to suppress Na metal dendrite penetration into the electrolyte bulk. The optimal NZSP-0.2Mg electrolyte endows a low interfacial resistance of 93 Ω cm2 at room temperature, over 16 times smaller than that of Na3Zr2Si2PO12. The Na plating/stripping with small polarization is retained under 0.3 mA cm-2 for more than 290 days (7000 h), representing a record high cycling stability of SEs for ASSMBs. An all-solid-state NaCrO2//Na battery is accordingly assembled manifesting a high capacity of 110 mA h g-1 at 1 C for 1755 cycles with almost no capacity decay. Excellent rate capability at 5 C is realized with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8%, signifying promising application in solid-state electrochemical energy storage systems.",Small
Mo2N–W2N Heterostructures Embedded in Spherical Carbon Superstructure as Highly Efficient Polysulfide Electrocatalysts for Stable Room-Temperature Na–S Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries are highly desirable for a sustainable large-scale energy-storage system due to their high energy density and low cost. Nevertheless, practical applications of RT Na–S batteries are still prevented by the shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides (NaPS), slow reaction kinetics of S, and incomplete conversion process of NaPS. Here, Mo2N–W2N heterostructures embedded in a spherical carbon superstructure (Mo2N–W2N@PC) are designed to efficiently suppress the “polysulfide shuttle” and promote NaPS redox reactions. The designed Mo2N–W2N@PC heterostructure with abundant heterointerfaces, high conductivity, and porosity can facilitate electron/ion diffusion and provide high catalytic activity for efficient NaPS conversion. The obtained Na–S battery delivers high reversible capacity with superior long-term cyclability (517 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 400 cycles) and unprecedented rate capability (417 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1). Furthermore, the electrocatalysis mechanism is revealed by combining in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV–vis spectra, and precipitation experiments. This work demonstrates a novel heterostructure design strategy that enables high-performance Na–S batteries.",Advanced Materials
"A (4,4)-connected zinc(II) coordination polymer constructed with the flexible 2-carboxy phenoxyacetate ligand: synthesis, conformation alteration and fluorescent properties","© 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.A new binary ZnII coordination polymer, [Zn(2-cpa)(H2O)] n (2D-Zn) has been prepared by a 120 °C hydrothermal reaction of zinc(II) sulfate heptahydrate and 2-carboxy phenoxyacetic acid (2-H2cpa) in the presence of potassium hydroxide. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the ZnII ion is located in a deformed ZnO6 octahedron bonded by one water and three 2-carboxy phenoxyacetate (2-cpa) ligands. The 2-cpa exhibits pentadentate double bridging chelate-μ 3 coordination mode and connects adjacent ZnII ions to generate a corrugated (4,4)-connected layer structure. The structures, conformation of 2-cpa and photoluminescence spectra for 2D-Zn have been carefully analyzed and compared with its two closely related compounds ̶ 1D [Zn(2-cpa)(H2O)] n (1D-Zn) and mononuclear [Zn(2-cpa)(H2O)3] (0D-Zn). The results showed that the conformation of 2-cpa in 2D-Zn has the maximum alteration and the corresponding fluorescence emission peak of 2D-Zn has the largest red-shift of 62 nm compared with that of free 2-H2cpa.",Zeitschrift fur Kristallographie - Crystalline Materials
Degradation of Layered Oxide Cathode in a Sodium Battery: A Detailed Investigation by X-Ray Tomography at the Nanoscale,"© 2021 The Authors. Small Methods published by Wiley-VCH GmbHThe degradation mechanism in a sodium cell of a layered Na0.48Al0.03Co0.18Ni0.18Mn0.47O2 (NCAM) cathode with P3/P2 structure is investigated by revealing the changes in microstructure and composition upon cycling. The work aims to rationalize the gradual performance decay and the alteration of the electrochemical response in terms of polarization, voltage signature, and capacity loss. Spatial reconstructions of the electrode by X-ray computed tomography at the nanoscale supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses show fractures and deformations in the cycled layered metal-oxide particles, as well as inorganic side compounds deposited on the material. These irreversible morphological modifications reflect structural heterogeneities across the cathode particles due to formation of various domains with different Na+ intercalation degrees. Besides, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data suggest that the latter inorganic species in the cycled electrode are mainly composed of NaF, Na2O, and NaCO3 formed by parasitic electrolyte decomposition. The precipitation of these insulating compounds at the electrode/electrolyte interphase and the related structural stresses induced in the material lead to a decrease in cathode particle size and partial loss of electrochemical activity. The retention of the NCAM phase after cycling suggests that electrolyte upgrade may improve the performance of the cathode to achieve practical application for sustainable energy storage.",Small Methods
Iron-organic frameworks-derived iron oxide adsorbents for hydrogen sulfide removal at room temperature,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdWe have reported iron-based MOFs by sonication of organic linkers with a freshly prepared iron hydroxide, which served as templates to yield iron oxide adsorbents after calcination. The PXRD analysis confirmed the presence of α-Fe2O3 and Na2SO4 in MOF-derived adsorbents. The XPS analysis confirmed the presence of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ species in all MOFs and derived iron oxide adsorbents. These adsorbents were studied for H2S removal in both dry and moist conditions at room temperature. The iron terephthalate MOF-derived iron oxide adsorbent showed the maximum adsorption capacity of 36.2 mg g−1 at moist conditions. The H2S removal process over iron oxide adsorbents was governed by the oxidation of H2S into sulfur and sulfates by Fe3+ and adsorbed oxygen. The spent adsorbent was regenerated by NH4OH to produce ammonium sulfate (liquid fertilizer), which is a novel approach to convert waste into value-added products.",Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering

Reportedly, there is no clear definition to define “self-supporting” materials, and also, no such comprehensive reviews have fully discussed the self-supporting materials in gas-involved electrochemical applications. Therefore, it is necessary to provide timely updates in this potential field. In this review, for the first time, a reasonable definition of self-supporting materials and comprehensively review the recent research progress of related electrodes in gas-involved electrocatalytic applications is given. Firstly, it is discussed their synthetic methodologies, including design principles, different types of substrates- and substrate-free structures. Subsequently, the recent advances of self-supporting electrodes for gas-involved key energy related electrocatalysis (i.e., hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, nitrogen reduction, and carbon dioxide reduction reactions) and their practical applications in water-splitting, fuel cells and metal-air batteries are mainly presented. Finally, a summary of the progress of self-supporting electrocatalysts, the remaining challenges, and the perspectives are given to instruct their future development.

Probing the atomic interaction between zinc clusters and defective carbon in promoting the wide temperature applications of lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Suppressing the dissolution and accelerating conversion kinetics of intermediate polysulfides are central to the practical usage of lithium−sulfur (Li–S) battery in a wide temperature range. Herein, an atomic engineering strategy is innovatively proposed to constructing a sulfur host consisting of chemical-anchoring zinc atomic cluster within double layer N-doped carbon matrix (ZnAC[sbnd]CM@CL) for addressing concerns. The as-prepared ZnAC[sbnd]CM@CL@S can deliver capacity as high as 1451 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C with electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S ratio) of 5.5 μL mg−1 and maintain 749 mAh g−1 after 1200 cycles (fading rate of 0.021% per cycle) at 5 C. Remarkably, the reversible capacity holds 627 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C at the −25 ℃. By a further combination analysis of electron holography (EH) and geometry phase analysis (GPA), the outstanding performance is revealed to be mainly traced to synergistic effect of the polarity N-doped multi-layer carbon matrix and internal periodical charge field induced by atomic strain, greatly enhancing the capability towards on the immobilization and conversion of intermediate polysulfides. More importantly, such an interplay also renders the strongly coupled cathode achieve a high area specific capacity of 8.71 mAh cm−2 even the area sulfur loading obtain to 7.34 mg cm−2. This atomic-level engineering strategy might shed light on the novel insights on the design of high performance for sulfur hosts.",Energy Storage Materials
Highly conductive ionogel electrolytes based on N-ethyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide FSI and NaFSI mixtures and their applications in sodium batteries,"© 2021 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.The development of highly conductive and safe electrolytes for sodium-ion batteries is an emerging field beyond lithium battery technologies. In this work we have developed new ionogel electrolytes consisting of a binary mixture of an organic ionic plastic crystal, N-ethyl-N-methylpyrrolidiniumbis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (C2mpyrFSI), mixed with NaFSI supported on a mat of electrospun poly (vinylidene fluoride) nanofibers. The salt mixture near the eutectic composition (35 mol% NaFSI) was selected for further study after a detailed phase diagram analysis and ionogel electrolytes based on this were prepared. The ionic conductivity of the prepared ionogel composite reaches 2.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 at ambient temperature. This ionogel membrane possessed a relatively high Na-ion transference number of 0.44 at 50 ◦C and we demonstrate the performance of a Na metal full cell using a NaFePO4 cathode (1.75–4.0 V). The assembled cells show a good capacity retention with coulombic efficiency close to 100% at various C rates between C/20, C/10 and C/5, achieving 120 mAh g−1 at C/20. The long term charge/discharge performance is also demonstrated.

N-doped carbon tubes with sodiophilic sites for dendrite free sodium metal anode,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Sodium metal is one of the most promising anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical capacity, low redox potential, abundant content and low price. However, due to the high reactivity and infinite volume change of sodium metal, unstable SEI film and dendrite are formed during the repeated plating and stripping process, leading to low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and inferior cycle stability, even serious safety issue. Herein, linear shaped sodiophilic N-doped hollow carbon tubes (NCTs) were designed and constructed as stable sodium metal hosts. The plating and stripping behavior of sodium metal in NCT is investigated by in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that sodium metal is preferentially nucleated and deposited in the tube, and then could be completely stripped off from the tube. Moreover, Na@NCTs anode can be stably cycled for more than 800 h with a high CE of 98.53% at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and a capacity of 1 mAh cm−2. The analysis result indicates that the improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the special designed nitrogen functional groups tuned sodiophilic surface with enhanced fast surface kinetics and the hollow carbon tube structure. Finally, a full cell with NVP@C and Na@NCTs as the cathode and anode, respectively, was assembled and delivered a capacity of 81.46 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Our results demonstrate that NCT is a promising candidate as a sodium metal host for future generation of sodium metal batteries.",Solid State Ionics
Ionic and Thermal Transport in Na-Ion-Conducting Ceramic Electrolytes,"© 2021, The Author(s).We have studied the ionic and thermal transport properties along with the thermodynamic key properties of a Na-ion-conducting phosphate ceramic. The system Na1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 (NATP) with x = 0.3 was taken as a NASICON-structured model system which is a candidate material for solid electrolytes in post-Li energy storage. The commercially available powder (NEI Coorp., USA) was consolidated using cold isostatic pressing before sintering. In order to compare NATP with the “classical” NASICON system, Na1+xZr2(SiO4)x(PO4)3−x (NaZSiP) was synthesized with compositions of x = 1.7 and x = 2, respectively, and characterized with regard to their ionic and thermal transport behavior. While ionic conductivity of the NaZSiP compositions was about more than two orders of magnitude higher than in NATP, the thermal conductivity of the NASICON compound showed an opposite behavior. The room temperature value was about a factor two higher in NATP compared to NaZSiP. While the thermal conductivity decreases with increasing temperature in NATP, it increases with increasing temperature in NaZSiP. However, the overall change of this thermal transport parameter over the measured temperature range from room temperature up to 800 °C appeared to be relatively small.",International Journal of Thermophysics
"Recent advances in potassium-ion hybrid capacitors: Electrode materials, storage mechanisms and performance evaluation","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.For the purpose of bridging the gap between traditional batteries with high energy density and supercapacitors with high power output and long lifespan, hybrid capacitors whose dual electrodes are composed of a battery-type electrode and a capacitor-type electrode are gradually being valued. In recent years, with the unceasing progress of potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), the corresponding potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) have also attracted widespread attention. However, PIHCs still face quite a few problems such as poor cycle life, inferior rate performance and undesirable energy density and power density. It is generally believed that these unsatisfactory properties ascribe to the large radius of K+. For this reason, a lot of works focusing on the design of materials’ structures have been made. In fact, in addition to electrode materials, electrolytes, binders and separators will all have an important impact on the performances of PIHCs. In this review, we not only summarize various battery-type materials used in PIHCs, but also introduce capacitor-type materials, electrolytes, separators, binders, etc. that have been used in PIHCs. Besides, the charge storage mechanisms of PIHCs are discussed as well. In order to reflect the development status of PIHCs and look forward to their prospects, the comparison of PIHCs with other metal-ion hybrid capacitors is also discussed. Finally, some opinions and suggestions on PIHCs are presented. Hope this review can be helpful to readers.",Energy Storage Materials
"Enhanced Safety and Performance of High-Voltage Solid-State Sodium Battery through Trilayer, Multifunctional Electrolyte Design","© 2021Solid-state electrolytes are promising to resolve the safety hazards and low energy density of traditional liquid batteries. However, the practical application of these electrolytes has been impaired by the low ionic conductivity and an unstable interface present with a high-voltage cathode. Here, an improvement of ionic conductivity, interface, and safety was achieved by impregnating anti-oxidation polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and anti-reduction poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) into a sandwich sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) framework with a dense core and porous outer layers. Using this sandwich composite electrolyte (SCE), a high ionic conductivity of 4.13×10−4 S cm−1 at 30°C was obtained owing to long-range and continuous ionic conduction pathways in the porous network. The interfacial resistance was greatly improved through the creation of a compact and stable interface. More importantly, the safety of this SCE is improved through the in-situ formation of a central, dense NASICON layer, which suppressed dendrite growth. Furthermore, a high-voltage solid-state battery combining Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) with this SCE exhibited an impressive rate performance with long cycle life. This study offers a promising strategy to design ultra-safe, high energy density, solid-state batteries.",Energy Storage Materials

By using the ball-milling technique instead of a usual heating process, the vitreous domain is extended from 24 ≤ x ≤ 41 to 20 ≤ x ≤ 80. For the first time the conductivity of these glasses has been measured by impedance spectroscopy and an ionic conductivity of 1.9 × 10−6 S.cm−1 at 25 °C is achieved for x = 80. A glass-ceramic processing from the Na2S richest glass composition is implemented in order to stabilize the sample and to eliminate Na dendrite formation that occurs in the glass during DC current experiments. Finally, this paper shows the positive impact of crystallization and reveals that the glass-ceramization is an interesting process in the framework of synthesis of electrolytes for all-solid-state sodium batteries.",Materials Research Bulletin
Flexible and stable 3D lithium metal anodes based on self-standing MXene/COF frameworks for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Lithium metal (Li) is believed to be the ultimate anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to the advantages of high theoretical capacity, the lowest electrochemical potential, and light weight. Nevertheless, issues such as uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites, large volume changes, high chemical reactivity, and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) hinder its rapid development and practical application. Herein a stable and dendrite-free Li-metal anode is obtained by designing a flexible and freestanding MXene/COF framework for metallic Li. COF-LZU1 microspheres are distributed among the MXene film framework. Lithiophilic COF-LZU1 microspheres as nucleation seeds can promote uniform Li nucleation by homogenizing the Li+ flux and lowering the nucleation barrier, finally resulting in dense and dendrite-free Li deposition. Under the regulation of the COF-LZU1 seeds, the Coulombic efficiency of the MXene/COF-LZU1 framework and electrochemical stability of corresponding symmetric cells are obviously enhanced. Li-S full cells with the modified Li-metal anode and sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (S@PAN) cathode also exhibited a superior electrochemical performance.

Separator Design Variables and Recommended Characterization Methods for Viable Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery is at the forefront of technologies that can outperform lithium-ion in at least one index of performance, provided that solutions to poor cycle-life can be devised. One key component of the Li–S battery is the separator, because it holds tremendous promise for improving cycle-life by mitigating the well-known polysulfide shuttle, enabling lean electrolyte configurations, and restricting solid electrolyte interphase growth at the Li-metal anode. However, in response to the advent of the “functional separator” for Li–S batteries, severe misinterpretations of progress have been made due to the often incomplete presentation of the performance and characterization criteria for these new components. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to look critically at what has been achieved in Li–S separator research, with the aim of reconciling actual progress against claimed improvements. This review advocates the best practices for reporting the performance of Li–S separators and proposes guidelines on measurements with respect to key properties. It is believed that the adoption of these measurement practices, testing, and reporting styles will enable more accurate determination of separator performance and properties, which in turn can allow for more meaningful comparisons between various approaches, as well as facilitating the transition of laboratory concepts to practical designs.",Advanced Materials Technologies

Sodiophilic Au/reduced-graphene-oxide for dendrite free sodium metal anode,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In this work, a nanocomposite composed of gold nanoparticles (NPs) supported by reduced graphene oxide (Au/rGO) is designed and synthesized via a simple chemical bath reaction method at room temperature followed by post annealing treatment. Au/rGO is further employed as the host of sodium metal anode with a dendrite free morphology, demonstrated by ex-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and in-situ optical microscopy characterization. As a result, Au/rGO electrode exhibits a small overpotential of 3.5 mV at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 with a specific capacity of 2 mAh cm−2. Meanwhile, it can stably cycle for 400 h at a high current density of 5 mA cm−2 with an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm−2. Detailed studies indicate that the excellent electrochemical performance is mainly owing to the sodiophilic surface enabled by Au NPs, guiding the Na metal uniform deposition, thus effectively inhibiting the sodium dendrite formation. Finally, as a proof of concept, a full battery composed of Na@Au/rGO as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)3@C as the cathode is assembled and delivers a capacity of 93.9 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 180 cycles. Our work proves that Au/rGO is a promising host for sodium metal anode.",Journal of Power Sources
Sulfur-Based Aqueous Batteries: Electrochemistry and Strategies,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.While research interest in aqueous batteries has surged due to their intrinsic low cost and high safety, the practical application is plagued by the restrictive capacity (less than 600 mAh g-1) of electrode materials. Sulfur-based aqueous batteries (SABs) feature high theoretical capacity (1672 mAh g-1), compatible potential, and affordable cost, arousing ever-increasing attention and intense efforts. Nonetheless, the underlying electrochemistry of SABs remains unclear, including complicated thermodynamic evolution and insufficient kinetics metrics. Consequently, multifarious irreversible reactions in various application systems imply the systematic complexity of SABs. Herein, rather than simply compiling recent progress, this Perspective aims to construct a theory-to-application methodology. Theoretically, attention has been paid to a critical appraisal of the aqueous-S-related electrochemistry, including fundamental properties evaluation, kinetics metrics with transient and steady-state analyses, and thermodynamic equilibrium and evolution. To put it into practice, current challenges and promising strategies are synergistically proposed. Practically, the above efforts are employed to evaluate and develop the device-scale applications, scilicet flow-SABs, oxide-SABs, and metal-SABs. Last, chemical and engineering insights are rendered collectively for the future development of high-energy SABs.",Journal of the American Chemical Society
High-voltage and intrinsically safe supercapacitors based on a trimethyl phosphate electrolyte,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Supercapacitors exhibit excellent power density and durability due to their high ionic conductivity and the electrochemical stability of nitrile or carbonate-based electrolytes. However, these commonly used electrolytes have inherent risks due to the high flammability of organic solvents. With the widespread use of supercapacitors, such safety problems have aroused great concerns. Although considerable research efforts have been devoted to improve the safety of lithium-ion batteries, research focusing on safe supercapacitor performance is limited. Here a nonflammable organic electrolyte based on trimethyl phosphate (TMP) solvent is proposed for safe operation. The physical and electrochemical characteristics of the TMP-based electrolyte are investigated by self-extinguishing time, ionic conductivity, viscosity, cyclic voltammetry, and charge-discharge measurements. We demonstrate that the TMP-based electrolyte enables dramatic improvements in safety as well as good transport properties and stable charge-discharge cycling for 10 000 cycles at a high working voltage (3.3 V) at both low and high current densities. The TMP electrolyte was found to decompose and form a film on the electrode surface preventing further electrolyte decomposition. This helps to widen the electrochemical stability window of supercapacitors, realizing high energy and power by increasing the upper voltage. Therefore, the electrolyte system reported here is a promising candidate for safe and performant supercapacitors in large-scale energy storage applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

Manipulating the Electronic Structure of Nickel via Alloying with Iron: Toward High-Kinetics Sulfur Cathode for Na-S Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.The sluggish conversion kinetics and severe shuttle effect in room-temperature Na-S (RT Na-S) batteries cause knotty issues, such as poor rate performance, fast capacity decay as well as low Coulombic efficiency, which seriously impede their practical application. Therefore, exploiting cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for absorbing soluble long-chain sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) and expediting NaPSs conversion is of paramount importance. Herein, catalyst mining is first conducted by density functional theory calculations, which reveal that the alloying of Fe into Ni can tailor the electronic structure, leading to lower reaction energy barrier for polysulfide conversion. Based on this, FeNi3@hollow porous carbon spheres (FeNi3@HC) as a promising sulfur host for RT Na-S batteries are rationally designed and fabricated. As expected, the S@FeNi3@HC cathode exhibits an excellent cycling stability (591 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 2 A g-1) and outstanding rate performance (383 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1). Our work demonstrates an effective strategy (i.e., alloying strategy with a rich electron state) to design superior electrocatalysts for RT Na-S batteries.",ACS Nano
Nonflammable Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Ion-Conductive Polyester Networks for Sodium Metal Cells with Excellent Cycling Stability and Enhanced Safety,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Sodium metal batteries have received a considerable amount of attention because of the low cost of Na resources and high theoretical capacity of Na metal. However, liquid electrolytes used in batteries cause safety problems such as fires and explosions under abnormal conditions. The uncontrolled dendritic Na growth in the cell also results in poor cycling stability. Herein, we report nonflammable gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) synthesized by in situ cross-linking of a gel precursor containing ion-conductive polycaprolactone triacrylate. The GPE exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 6.3 mS cm-1 because of the Na+-carbonyl interactions and high segmental motion of polycaprolactone chains despite its three-dimensional network structure. The ion-conductive polymer networks effectively suppress the growth of Na dendrite by inducing uniform Na deposition on the Na electrode, resulting in improved interfacial characteristics of the Na electrode. The Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 cell employing GPE delivers high discharge capacities at high C rates and exhibits excellent cycling stability. Additionally, the superior thermal stability of GPE prevents a short circuit of the cell at high temperature, which allows safe operation of the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 cells.",ACS Applied Energy Materials

Hierarchical Porous Carbon Nanofibers with Tunable Geometries and Porous Structures Fabricated by a Scalable Electrospinning Technique,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyPorous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) have rich channels for transporting ions, molecules, and nanoparticles, but the control over their porous structures is a challenge. Here, we report a scalable electrospinning technique by using poly(tetrafluoroethylene) as a pore template, boric acid as a cross-linking agent, and polyvinyl alcohol and polyurethane as dual carbon precursors to fabricate flexible PCNFs with tunable geometries and macro/meso/microporous structures. In the water solvent, the negatively charged template cross-links with the positively charged carbon precursors to form a stable sol for electrospinning. By varying the mass ratios of these precursors, the electrospun hybrid nanofibers are directly transformed into B-F-N-O doped PCNFs with tunable macro-, meso-, and micropores after carbonization. The porosity of an individual PCNF is as high as ∼85%, and the pore volume can be tuned from 0.23 to 0.58 cm3·g-1. When constructing high-sulfur-content (86 wt %) electrodes with the freestanding PCNF films, the porous structures with rich electroactive sites provide rapid pathways for poly-anions and have strong chemisorption of poly-sulfides, leading to a great electrochemical performance. The reported strategy offers a new perspective for synthesizing hierarchical PCNFs with appealing applications.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Conductive Al-Doped ZnO Framework Embedded with Catalytic Nanocages as a Multistage-Porous Sulfur Host in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical SocietyLithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries possess many practical challenges including the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) “shuttle effect” and their sluggish conversion kinetics. To address these issues, a unique hierarchical porous architecture, combining highly conductive ordered macroporous skeleton and embedded microporous particles is rationally designed as a dual-effective polysulfide immobilizer and conversion promoter. In this nanoporous architecture, Al-doped ZnO (AZO) acts as a conductive macroporous framework, profiting chemical anchoring of LiPS as well as facilitating electrolyte infiltration and ion diffusion; Co nanoparticle-anchored N-doped carbon (Co-NC) derived from CoZn-metal-organic framework is embedded in the macropores to further strengthen the LiPS adsorption, catalytically accelerating conversion kinetics of LiPS simultaneously. Consequently, the Co-NC@AZO/S cathode delivers a notable rate capability of 635.5 mA h g-1at 5 C. A high area capacity of about 5.8 mA h cm-2with a mass loading of 6.8 mg cm-2is also achieved under a lean electrolyte (E/S = 5.7). Additionally, the Li-S pouch cells equipped with Co-NC@AZO can be extended to sulfur loading as high as 4.0 mg cm-2, delivering a superb capability of 897.5 mA h g-1after 100 cycles. This work puts forward a design for stably cycled and practically viable Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
"Organic electrode materials for non-aqueous, aqueous, and all-solid-state Na-ion batteries","© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Na-ion batteries (NIBs) are promising alternatives to Li-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the low cost, abundance, and high sustainability of sodium resources. However, the high performance of inorganic electrode materials in LIBs does not extend to NIBs because of the larger ion size of Na+than Li+and more complicated electrochemistry. Therefore, it is vital to search for high-performance electrode materials for NIBs. Organic electrode materials (OEMs) with the advantages of high structural tunability and abundant structural diversity show great promise in developing high-performance NIBs. To achieve advanced OEMs for NIBs, a fundamental understanding of the structure-performance correlation is desired for rational structure design and performance optimization. In this review, recent advances in developing OEMs for non-aqueous, aqueous, and all-solid-state NIBs are presented. The challenges, advantages, mechanisms, development, and applications of advanced OEMs in NIBs are also discussed.

A high performance Li-rich β-Li2IrO3electrode for symmetric lithium ion batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.A symmetric battery composed of a single electrode material as both the anode and cathode is a model battery configuration owing to its distinctive advantages over the existing asymmetric ones in terms of cost, production process and safety issues. However, the limited choice of suitable electrode materials limits the practical application of high-performance symmetric batteries. Herein, we report a novel Li-rich β-Li2IrO3(LIO) symmetric electrode material with a reversible capacity of >200 mA h g−1between 3.0 and 4.8 V (LIO-cathode) and >300 mA h g−1between 0.1 and 3.0 V (LIO-anode), respectively. The synthesized LIO materials manifested a unique three dimensionally (3D) ordered hyperhoneycomb-like structure that endows the material with enhanced structural integrity and stability, leading to an outstanding cycle life of both the LIO-cathode and anode.

Combined high catalytic activity and polysulfide confinement in hierarchical carbon-encapsulated CoSe hollow core-shell spheres for high-performance lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Hierarchical carbon-encapsulated CoSe (designated as C–CoSe) hollow core-shell sphere is designed and constructed to relieve shuttle effect of the LiPSs, thereby leading to the performance enhancement of the LSBs. The prepared C–CoSe spheres comprise of spherical nano-aggregates as hollow core and N-doped carbon shell. Kinetics experiments and theoretical calculation as well as in situ Raman spectra reveal that the C–CoSe hollow core-shell spheres can effectively immobilize the LiPSs intermediates by chemical adsorption and physical confinement, and meanwhile accelerate conversion kinetics of the LiPSs owing to strong catalytic effect and superior electron conductivity during electrochemical reaction, thereby the shuttle effect being effectively inhibited. In addition, as a sulfur host, sufficient sulfur storage space related to hierarchical porous structure enable effective accommodation of volume change and full efficacy with sulfur loading of 73%. Benefiting from above advantages, the C–CoSe sulfur cathode exhibits impressive rate performance and excellent cycle stability. Even at a sulfur loading of 3 mg cm−2, a capacity of 584 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C is achieved and the capacity is maintained 450 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles. Our results provide an effective strategy to design advanced sulfur hosts for the performance enhancement of the LSBs.",Journal of Power Sources
Designing dual-defending system based on catalytic and kinetic iron Pyrite@C hybrid fibers for long-life room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The poor conductivity and severe polysulfide dissolution greatly restrict the development of room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries. To address these issues, a dual-polysulfide-defending system based on catalytic and kinetic hybrid fibers is designed to realize high-performance and long-life for RT-Na/S batteries. The hollow carbon fibers filled with yolk-shell FeS2/C hollow nanocubes (FeS2-YSB@BIT) are constructed as the flexible sulfur host. The highly conductive and porous network ensures fast electron/ion transports and facilitates high mass loading. More impressively, the polar FeS2 boxes ensure the strong chemical binding and high catalytic redox reaction on polysulfides, which produce the first defense on polysulfide shuttle. Meanwhile, the FeS2@C/carbon nanotubes (CNT) hybrid film works as the modifying layer on the separator, which builds the second defense to ion shuttle. Taken the advantages of both dual-polysulfide-defending system and the hierarchical polar electrode, the RT-Na/S battery achieves superior high-rate capability, long-term cycling stability and high energy storages. It obtains an ultralow capacity decay rate (0.024%) during 1000 cycles at the rate of 2C with a high mass loading of 7.6 mg cm−2. Therefore, this work not only designs a freestanding kinetic and catalytic host for sulfur electrodes, but also provides a new design on RT-Na/S batteries to realize long life, superior rate capability and high energy storage synchronously.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Asymmetry-structure electrolyte with rapid Li+ transfer pathway towards high-performance all-solid-state lithium–sulfur battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.All-solid-state lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery, with solid state electrolyte (SSE) replacing liquid electrolyte, is considered as promising candidate for next-generation energy storage devices due to the high capacity and safety. However, the fabrication of SSE with high ion conduction and efficient dendrite suppression remains a daunting challenge. Herein, an asymmetric Li0.33La0.557TiO3 (LLTO) framework with porous layer and dense layer is designed and fabricated, followed by impregnating poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) to prepare SSE. The continuous LLTO framework serves as rapid lithium ion (Li+) transfer pathway, imparting an excellent ionic conductivity of 1.49 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C, over 40 times higher than that of blank PEO. The presence of dense layer remarkably improves the compression strength of composite electrolyte and facilitates the Li+ uniform deposition, thus effectively suppressing the lithium dendrite growth. As a result, the assembled Li–S battery exhibits extraordinary cycling stability, which preserves a capacity of 907.6 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of ~ 99%. Meanwhile, the continuous PEO phase that rooted in the porous layer of framework also imparts composite electrolyte favorable flexibility and processability.",Journal of Membrane Science

And sulfide sodium solid electrolytes are key to enable room-temperature all-solid-state sodium batteries. Herein, we report the quaternary nanosized solid electrolyte Na10SnSb2S12 synthetized through liquid phase process. The crystalline structure and diffusion path of Na10SnSb2S12 are investigated through the first principles calculations. The Na10SnSb2S12 electrolyte presents a room temperature conductivity of 0.52 mS cm−1 at 25 °C and very low activation energy of 0.23 eV as well as excellent air stability by replacing phosphorus with antimony. Moreover, the small particle size of the solid electrolytes enhances the contact between solid electrolyte and electrode, reducing the interfacial contact resistance. Consequently, the TiS2/Na10SnSb2S12/Na all-solid-state sodium batteries show excellent cycling stability and exhibit a capacity of 119.6 mAh g−1 after cycling for 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"S edge/center-selectively doped graphene oxide for bisphenol A electro-degradation: Preparation, efficiency and mechanism","© 2020The operation efficiency of electrocatalysis is strongly influenced by the characteristics of anode materials. Thus, this study on electrochemical oxidation was conducted on the basis of the oriental design of electrode materials as a means of achieving maximal and stable degradation efficiency. Heteroatom hybrid graphene oxides (GO) have recently been regarded one of the major matrices popularly used for electrode materials due to their excellent electronic properties and long-term operation stability. However, the doping species of heteroatoms are uncontrollable, and the corresponding structural effects and mechanism are unclear. Moreover, the use of electrocatalytic technology is still not a promising approach for system optimization. With the view of significantly improving operational performance, single/multiple-form S-doped GO (SGO) were designed and prepared as anodes by using radical and non-radical precursors. Bisphenol A (BPA) was used as the model contaminant to elucidate the degradation efficiency of the electrocatalytic oxidation. Results indicate that the dominated active radicals of O2[rad]− were more likely generated as C[sbnd]SOx[sbnd]C at the GO edge rather than as S in the skeleton. The source of O2[rad]− was not from the dissolved O2 but from the surface functional oxygen groups and the C[sbnd]SOx[sbnd]C on the catalysts. However, the S in the skeleton highly contributed to the stability of the catalyst. Moreover, analytical results based on density functional theory (DFT) calculation confirmed the influence of the heteroatom species on the efficiency of the electrocatalytic oxidation and the proposed mechanism. This proposal can provide an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of electrocatalysis and an optimal operation strategy when using related carbon materials for practical applications.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Reactivity-guided formulation of composite solid polymer electrolytes for superior sodium metal batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) can effectively address the dendrite growth and safety concerns associated with current battery technologies, but their implementation is still plagued by low ionic conductivity and high interfacial impedance. Herein, we report a reactivity-guided strategy towards the synthesis of a composite solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) with optimized compositions of polyester PPC, ceramic NASICON and the PEO host to simultaneously improve ionic conductivity, interfacial impedance, electrochemical stability, and mechanical properties. We formulate a novel synergistic approach that effectively increases the amorphousness of the composite SPE and forms anin situsodium-ion conductive wetting layer upon contacting and reacting with the metallic sodium electrode to enable solid-state sodium metal batteries with superior performance. Compared to the conventional PEO electrolyte, the proposed composite SPE exhibits 25 times higher Na+conductivity (0.12 mS cm−1) and 10 times lower interfacial impedance. Solid-state full cells are further demonstrated with nearly 90% capacity retention after cycling at 1C rate for 500 cycles.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Critical effects of electrolyte recipes for Li and Na metal batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.The pursuit of rechargeable batteries with high energy density has triggered enormous efforts in developing Li/Na metal batteries considering the extremely high specific capacity of Li/Na metal anodes. As is typical for a new battery system, electrolyte design should immediately keep up with the specific electrode chemistry. This is especially true since Li/Na metal anodes face the problems of dendritic growth, hyper-reactivity, and an intrinsic safety concern, but the conventional electrolytes used for Li/Na-ion batteries fall short in sustaining their stable cyclability. Here, we intend to identify and elucidate the critical effects brought by the electrolyte recipes in stabilizing Li/Na metal batteries. In addition, the working mechanism of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and the controversial role of LiF were reviewed. Based on a thorough discussion on these effects, we propose strategies that should be taken further. Finally, the remaining open questions and potential research directions for future development have been emphasized.",Chem
Type-II Clathrate Na24-δGe136 from a Redox-Preparation Route,"© 2021 The Authors. Chemistry - A European Journal published by Wiley-VCH GmbHThe metastable type-II clathrate Na24-δGe136 was obtained from Na12Ge17 by applying a two-step procedure. At first, Na12Ge17 was reacted at 70 °C with a solution of benzophenone in the ionic liquid (IL) 1,3-dibutyl-2-methylimidazolium-bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) azanide. The IL was inert towards Na12Ge17, but capable of dissolving the sodium salts formed in the redox reaction. By annealing at 340 °C under an argon atmosphere, the X-ray amorphous intermediate product was transformed to crystalline Na24-δGe136 (δ≈2) and α-Ge in an about 1 : 1 mass ratio. The product was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, chemical analysis, and 23Na solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Metallic properties of Na24-δGe136 were revealed by a significant Knight shift of the 23Na NMR signals and by a Pauli-paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility. At room temperature, Na24-δGe136 slowly ages, with a tendency to volume decrease and sodium loss.",Chemistry - A European Journal
Tuning the Linkers in Polymer-Based Cathodes to Realize High Sulfur Content and High-Performance Potassium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.The development of effective rechargeable potassium-sulfur (K-S) batteries has been retarded by a severe polysulfide shuttle effect and low sulfur content in the cathode (generally less than 40 wt %). Herein, a series of sulfur-linked polymers with different numbers of allyloxy linkers have been chosen to explore their effect on the performance of K-S batteries. By taking sulfur-linked tetra(allyloxy)-1,4-benzoquinone polymer (poly(S4-TABQ)) as the cathode of K-S batteries, its maximal sulfur content reaches ∼71 wt %, which displays a high capacity retention of 94.5% after 200 cycles (only 0.027% loss per cycle). Theoretical analyses and density functional theory calculations show that the abundant allyloxy linkers in poly(S4-TABQ) cathodes play a vital role in inhibiting the polysulfide shuttle effect and realizing high capacity, owing to the strong interaction of the allyloxy moieties with potassium polysulfides and the accelerated charge transfer during charge/discharge process. Moreover, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy analysis are conducted to explore the electrochemical mechanism in poly(S4-TABQ) cathodes, indicating that -C-Sn-·K+ (n = 2-6) and K2Sn (n = 2-6) coexist in K-S batteries without the formation of K2S groups. This study provides a novel insight into the application of sulfur-linked polymers as cathode material in potassium-sulfur batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C

Rapid High-Precision Diagnosis of the Capacity and Internal Resistance of Lithium-Ion Batteries Using Impedance Measurements,"© 2021 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS""). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which are increasingly employed for energy storage, should be reused whenever possible to mitigate resource depletion and environmental problems. This requires a nondestructive diagnostic method to assess their potential for reuse in terms of capacity reduction and power drop, which occurs with increased internal resistance. The diagnostic method should be fast and simplified with no need to adjust the temperature or state of charge (SOC) when classifying numerous LIBs. To develop such a method, we compiled 4,220 impedance measurements taken at temperatures ranging from -20 °C to 50 °C and SOCs from 0% to 100%. 18650-type cylindrical LIBs were used to construct a prediction model of the capacity or internal resistance via machine learning using the impedance, temperature, and open-circuit voltage, instead of the SOC. Through a strict selection of frequencies at which the impedances of used LIBs were measured, it was possible to simultaneously predict LIB capacity and internal resistance with high precision at any temperature or SOC after less than 1 min of impedance measurement. To enhance the generalization performance, three types of degraded LIBs were employed in the prediction model. Finally, this study demonstrated improved data prediction in the extrapolation area.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
Knocking down the kinetic barriers towards fast-charging and low-temperature sodium metal batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Current knowledge on Na metal anode has been limited on its room-temperature or high-temperature (molten Na-S system) performances. However, the properties related to its low-temperature and fast-charging performances are rarely covered. Herein, we show that, using a conventional carbonate-based electrolyte, needle-like Na deposits sprout at -20 °C with a spiking impedance of ∼2.8 × 104 Ω observed in symmetric cell configuration, making an early failure of the battery within tens of hours. By knocking down the kinetic barriers of Na+ ion de-solvation and its subsequent diffusion through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), we enable flat and spherical Na deposits at -20 °C with a massively reduced interfacial impedance. This has been realized by using (i) a weakly solvated electrolyte that shows a low solvation energy towards Na+ ions, and (ii) a Na15Sn4/NaF biphasic artificial SEI for promoting unhindered Na+ ion transfer at the Na metal/electrolyte interface. Ultimately, a high-voltage Na/Na3V2(PO4)2O2F battery is developed to stand low temperatures down to -30 °C and fast charging up to 30C. The design strategy provided herein underlines the simultaneous de-solvation and SEI control for achieving low-temperature and fast-charging sodium metal batteries and presents as a prototype of how the kinetic barriers can be overcome under extreme conditions.",Energy and Environmental Science
Effect of the heating rate to prevent the generation of iron oxides during the hydrothermal synthesis of lifepo4,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have gained much interest in recent years because of the increasing energy demand and the relentless progression of climate change. About 30% of the manufacturing cost for LIBs is spent on cathode materials, and its level of development is lower than the negative electrode, separator diaphragm and electrolyte, therefore becoming the “controlling step”. Numerous cathodic materials have been employed, LiFePO4 being the most relevant one mainly because of its excellent performance, as well as its rated capacity (170 mA·h·g−1 ) and practical operating voltage (3.5 V vs. Li+/Li). Nevertheless, producing micro and nanoparticles with high purity levels, avoiding the formation of iron oxides, and reducing the operating cost are still some of the aspects still to be improved. In this work, we have applied two heating rates (slow and fast) to the same hydrothermal synthesis process with the main objective of obtaining, without any reducing agents, the purest possible LiFePO4 in the shortest time and with the lowest proportion of magnetite impurities. The reagents initially used were: FeSO4, H3PO4, and LiOH, and a crucial phenomenon has been observed in the temperature range between 130 and 150◦C, being verified with various techniques such as XRD and SEM.",Nanomaterials

Traditional sulfurization processes generally require high vacuum systems, high reaction temperatures, and toxic chemicals, utilizing complicated procedures with poor composition and morphology controllability. Herein, a facile method is reported for synthesizing nanostructured copper sulfide using a sulfurization reaction with Na2S at room temperature under non-vacuum conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the morphology, composition, and optical properties of nanostructured copper sulfides could be controlled by the Na2S solution concentration and the reaction time. Nanostructured copper sulfides were synthesized in nanospheres, nanoplates, and nanoplate-based complex morphologies with various oxidation states. Further-more, by comparing the optical properties of nanostructured copper sulfides with different oxidation states, we determined that reflectivity in the near infrared (NIR) region decreases with increasing oxidation states. These results reveal that the Na2S solution concentration and reaction time are key factors for designing nanostructured copper sulfides, providing new insights for synthesis methods of metal sulfide nanomaterials.",Nanomaterials
Regulating Deposition Behavior of Sodium Ions for Dendrite-Free Sodium-Metal Anode,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHConstructing dendrite-free sodium metal anodes with admirable electrochemical performance and long cycle-life is crucial for the practical application of sodium-metal batteries (SMBs). One of the feasible methods is to design 3D skeletons with sodiophilicity. Herein, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the co-existence of O and N functional groups on a carbon matrix can imbue strong sodiophilicity, and can regulate the Na deposition behavior to planar extension. Under the guidance of DFT calculation results, robust 3D carbon nanofibers are fabricated with sodiophilic O and N functional groups, which simultaneously facilitates homogeneous Na+ distribution and a dendrite-free construction. The stabilized sodium metal anode achieves an ultra-long cycle life of 1600 h at 1 mA cm−2 and an overpotential of merely ≈22 mV at 4 mA cm−2 in Na||Na symmetric batteries. Furthermore, superior electrochemical properties are demonstrated in both Na-O2 cell and a full sodium ion cell using Na3V2(PO4)3 as a cathode, laying the foundation for the next generation high-performance SMBs.",Advanced Energy Materials
Self-standing and high-performance B4C/Sn/acetylene black@reduced graphene oxide films as sodium-ion half/full battery anodes,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdSn-based materials show great potentials as sodium-ion battery (SIB) anodes. However, limited to the preparation process and expensive raw materials, it is a great challenge to large-scale produce self-standing Sn-based materials. Herein, we develop a cost-effective and large-scale production method to fabricate flexible B4C/Sn/acetylene black@reduced graphene oxide (B4C/Sn/AB@rGO) films as self-standing SIB anodes by using high energy ball milling technology and self-standing process. In the film, the coated B4C acts as a conductor to enhance the internal conductivity and AB is used as a shell of B4C/Sn to accelerate the absorption of electrolyte solution, while rGO plays a role as a tie to connect B4C/Sn/AB units to accelerate the electronic transmission and simultaneously alleviate the volume expansion during the charge/discharge process. Finally, the B4C/Sn/AB@rGO films as the SIB anodes deliver a high reversible capacity of 393.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability at 1 A g−1 with the reversible capacity of 155.5 mA h g−1 over 500 cycles. Moreover, the assembled sodium-ion full cell shows a stable capacity at 201.5 mA h g−1 for 50 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. This study indicates that our synthetic B4C/Sn/AB@rGO film has a great potential as the self-standing SIB anode.",Applied Materials Today
Anion-Doped Cobalt Selenide with Porous Architecture for High-Rate and Flexible Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHEmerging catalytic host for sulfur is an effective approach to breaking the limits of lithium–sulfur batteries for practical applications. Herein, the hydrangea-shaped Co0.85Se electrocatalyst with macroporous architecture is synthesized. Besides, to improve the electronic conductivity of Co0.85Se, some defects (S-doped) are introduced into the structure of crystals. The S-doped Co0.85Se exhibited an outstanding electrocatalytic effect on lithium polysulfides conversion and can induce and regulate uniform growth of insoluble Li2S on its surface due to the synergistic adsorption by Se and S. As a result, the S/C cathode achieved a high initial capacity of 1340.6 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C and a stable cycling capacity of 666.6 mAh g−1 at 1 C after 500 cycles by 5 wt% Co0.85SeS additions. Moreover, high S loading cathodes are designed through in situ synthesis of Co0.85SeS on flexible carbon cloth (Co0.85SeS@CC). The porous and open framework of Co0.85SeS@CC facilitated electrolyte infiltration and accommodated the volume change of sulfur during the charge/discharge process. Taking by these advantages, a high areal capacity of 9.663 mAh cm−2 is achieved at a high sulfur loading of 9.98 mg cm−2. Even at a high current density of 15 mA cm−2, a reversible capacity of 603.7 mAh g−1 is maintained at a sulfur loading of 6.52 mg cm−2. This proposed work provides a feasible approach to high-rate and flexible Li–S batteries.",Small Methods
Mesoporous Yolk-Shell Structured Organosulfur Nanotubes with Abundant Internal Joints for High-Performance Lithium–Sulfur Batteries by Kinetics Acceleration,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHAlthough organosulfur compounds can protect lithium anodes, participate in the redox reaction, and suppress the shuttle effect, the sluggish electrochemical dynamics of their bulk structure and the notorious shuttle effect of covalent long-chain sulfurs largely impede their actual applications. Herein, sulfurized carbon nanotube@aminophenol-formaldehyde (SC@A) with covalently linked short-chain sulfurs is firstly synthesized by in situ polymerization of aminophenol-formaldehyde (AF) on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) followed by acetone etching and inverse sulfurization processes, forming mesoporous yolk-shell organosulfur nanotubes with abundant internal joints between the yolk of CNTs and the shell of sulfurized AF for the first time. In situ Raman spectra, in situ XRD patterns, and ex situ XPS spectra verify that the covalent short-chain sulfurs bring about a reversible solid-solid conversion process of sulfur, thoroughly avoiding the shuttle effect. The mesoporous yolk-shell structure with abundant internal joints can effectively accommodate the volume change, fully expose active sites and efficiently improve the transport of electrons and lithium ions, thus highly promoting the solid–solid electrochemical reaction kinetics. Therefore, the SC@A cathode exhibits a superior specific capacity of 841 mAh g−1 and a capacity decay of 0.06% per cycle within 500 cycles at a large current density of 5.0 C.",Small
Increasing Accessible Subsurface to Improving Rate Capability and Cycling Stability of Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHNumerous studies have reported that the enhancement of rate capability of carbonaceous anode by heteroatom doping is due to the increased diffusion-controlled capacity induced by expanding interlayer spacing. However, percentage of diffusion-controlled capacity is less than 30% as scan rate is larger than 1 mV s−1, suggesting there is inaccuracy in recognizing principle of improving rate capability of carbonaceous anode. In this paper, it is found that the heteroatom doping has little impact on interlayer spacing of carbon in bulk phase, meaning that diffusion-controlled capacity is hard to be enhanced by doping. After synergizing with tensile stress, however, the interlayer spacing in subsurface region is obviously expanded to 0.40 nm, which will increase the thickness of accessible subsurface region at high current density. So SRNDC-700 electrodes display a high specific capacity of 160.6 and 69.5 mAh g−1 at 20 and 50 A g−1, respectively. Additionally, the high reversibility of carbon structure insures ultralong cycling stability and hence attenuation of SRNDC-700 is only 0.0025% per cycle even at 10 A g−1 for 6000 cycles. This report sheds new insight into mechanism of improving electrochemical performance of carbonaceous anode by doping and provides a novel design concept for doping carbon.",Advanced Materials
Interfacial Protection Engineering of Sodium Nanoparticles toward Dendrite-Free and Long-Life Sodium Metal Battery,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe instability of interfacial solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer of metallic sodium (Na) anode during cycles results in the rapid capacity decay of sodium metal batteries (SMBs). Herein, the concept of interfacial protection engineering of Na nanoparticles (Na-NPs) is proposed first to achieve stable, dendrite-free, and long-life SMB. Employing an ion-exchange strategy, conformal Sn-Na alloy-SEI on the interface of Na-NPs is constructed, forming Sn@Na-NPs. The stable alloy-based SEI layer possesses the following three advantages: 1) significantly enhancing the transport dynamics of Na+ ions and electrons; 2) enabling the well-distributed deposition of Na+ ions to avoid the growth of dendrites; and 3) protecting the Sn@Na-NPs anode from the attack of electrolyte, thereby reducing the parasitic reaction and boosting the Coulombic efficiency of SMBs. Because of these virtues, the symmetric Sn@Na-NPs cell shows an ultralow voltage hysteresis of 0.54 V at 10 mA cm−2 after 600 h. Paired with the Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NaVPF) cathode, the NaVPF-Sn@Na-NPs full cell exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 89.2 mAh g−1 at 1 C and a high capacity retention of 81.6% after 600 cycles.",Small
Improving Na/Na3Zr2Si2PO12 Interface via SnOx/Sn Film for High-Performance Solid-State Sodium Metal Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSodium (Na) metal batteries have attracted much attention due to their rich resources, low cost, and high energy density. As a promising solid electrolyte, Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) is expected to be used in solid-state Na metal batteries addressing the safety concerns. However, due to the poor contact between NZSP and the Na metal, the interfacial resistance is too large to gain proper performance for practical solid-state batteries (SSBs) application. Here, a SnOx/Sn film is successfully introduced to improve the interface between Na and NZSP for enhancing the electrochemical performance of SSBs. As a result, the Na/NZSP interfacial resistance is dramatically reduced from 581 to 3 Ω cm2. The modified Na||Na symmetric cell keeps cycling over 1500 h with an overpotential of 40 mV at 0.1 mA cm–2 at room temperature. Even at current densities of 0.3 and 0.5 mA cm–2, the cell still maintains an excellent cyclability. When coupled with NaTi2(PO4)3 and a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, the full-cell demonstrates a good performance at 0.2 C and 1 C, respectively. The present work provides an effective way to solve the interface issue of SSBs.",Small Methods
Flower-Like Interlayer-Expanded MoS2−x Nanosheets Confined in Hollow Carbon Spheres with High-Efficiency Electrocatalysis Sites for Advanced Sodium–Sulfur Battery,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT-Na/S) battery is one of the most promising technologies for low-cost energy storage. However, application of RT-Na/S batteries is currently impeded by severe shuttle effects and volume expansion that limits both energy density and cycling stability. Herein, first, the first-principal calculation is used to find that the introduction of sulfur vacancies in MoS2 can effectively enhance polysulfide adsorption and catalytic ability as well as both the ion and electron conductivities. Then, unique MoS2−x/C composite spheres are further designed and synthesized with flower-like few-layer and interlayer-enlarged MoS2−x nanosheets space-confined in hollow carbon nanospheres by a “ship-in-a-bottle” strategy. With this novel design, the mass loading of S in the MoS2−x/C composite can be reached to as high as 75 wt%. Owing to the synergetic effect of interlayer-expanded and few-layer MoS2−x nanosheets and hollow carbon spheres matrix with high electronic/Na+ conductivity, the RT-Na/S batteries deliver highly stable cycle durability (capacity retention of 85.2% after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1) and remarkable rate capability (415.7 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1) along with high energy density. This design strategy of defect- and interlayer-engineering may find wide applications in synthesizing electrode materials for high-performance RT-Na/S batteries.",Small
Synthesis of model sodium sulfide films,"© 2021 Author(s).We report the direct deposition of model sodium sulfide films by RF magnetron sputtering from Na2S and Na2S2 deposition targets. Analytical characterization and electrochemical cycling indicate that the deposited films are amorphous with stoichiometries that correspond to Na2S3 and Na2S2 formed from the Na2S and Na2S2 targets, respectively. We propose that the loss of Na in the case of the Na2S target is due to preferential sputtering of Na resulting from the higher energy required to break the Na-S bonds in Na2S. The development of thin film sodium sulfides opens a new route to understanding their fundamental properties, such as Na+ transport, conductivity, and reactivity.","Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces and Films"
Carbon-coated NiMn layered double hydroxides/Ni3S2 nanocomposite for high performance supercapacitors,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdDue to the excellent ion insertion and exchange capacity, the layered double hydroxide (LDH) is considered to be an ideal electrode material for pseudocapacitor. However, the fast redox reaction of LDH always results in low power density and poor cycle stability.

All-solid-state Na+ ion supercapacitors using Na3Zr2Si2PO12-polymer hybrid films as electrolyte,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdWe report all-solid-state Na+ ion electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) for the first time in this study. These are fabricated using a novel Na+ ion solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) and high surface area (877 m2-g−1) activated carbon electrodes. Using salt (NaI), polyethylene oxide (PEO) and nano particles of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP), hybrid electrolyte films with compositions 10NaI-90[PEO1-xNZSPx], where 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.7 are synthesized by a novel milling assisted route.

The free-standing N-doped Murray carbon framework with the engineered quasi-optimal Se/C interface for high–Se-loading Li/Na–Se batteries at elevated temperature,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdLithium-selenium (Li–Se) and sodium-selenium (Na–Se) batteries have recently attracted increasing interest because of their high volumetric specific capacity. However, the practical application of the Se cathode is still hindered by volumetric expansion, slow redox reaction kinetics, low area Se-loading, and shuttle effect in ether electrolyte. In this work, we present hierarchically micro/meso/macroporous nitrogen-doped Murray carbon fibers (MCFs) inspired by generalized Murray's law with the engineered quasi-optimal Se/C interface as a free-standing high–Se-loading host for high-performance Li/Na–Se batteries at elevated temperature. Such a hierarchically porous framework not only provides adequate space to accommodate Se for reaction with structural stability but also ensures the rapid electron and ion transport to improve the redox reaction kinetics and to form uniform catholyte electrolyte interphase. At a high area Se-loading of 4 mg/cm2, the Se@MCF cathode maintains a discharge capacity of 425 mAh/g at 5 C after 200 cycles for the Li–Se battery and a discharge capacity of 490 mAh/g at 0.5 C after 200 cycles for the Na–Se battery. Even at high temperatures of 50 and 80 °C, the Se@MCF cathodes demonstrate stable cycling performance and decreased polarization. Our work here not only presents significant progress in the development of the high–Se-loading cathode for ultra-stable and high-capacity Li/Na–Se batteries but also sheds some light on the preparation of advanced free-standing electrodes for other energy storage systems.",Materials Today Energy
"Design Principle, Optimization Strategies, and Future Perspectives of Anode-Free Configurations for High-Energy Rechargeable Metal Batteries","© 2021, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University.Metal anodes (e.g., lithium, sodium and zinc metal anodes) based on a unique plating/stripping mechanism have been well recognized as the most promising anodes for next-generation high-energy metal batteries owing to their superior theoretical specific capacities and low redox potentials. However, realizing full utilization and the theoretical capacity of metal anodes remains challenging because of their high reactivity, poor reversibility, and nonplanar metal evolution patterns, which lead to irreversible loss of active metals and the electrolyte. To minimize the above issues, excess metal sources and flooded electrolytes are generally used for laboratory-based studies. Despite the superior cycling performance achieved for these cells, the metal-anode-excess design deviates from practical applications due to the low anode utilization, highly inflated coulombic efficiency, and undesirable volumetric capacity. In contrast, anode-free configurations can overcome these drawbacks while reducing fabrication costs and improving cell safety. In this review, the significance of anode-free configurations is elaborated, and different types of anode-free cells are introduced, including reported designs and proposed feasible yet unexplored concepts. The optimization strategies for anode-free lithium, sodium, zinc, and aluminum metal batteries are summarized. Most importantly, the remaining challenges for extending the cycle life of anode-free cells are discussed, and the requirements for anode-free cells to reach practical applications are highlighted. This comprehensive review is expected to draw more attention to anode-free configurations and bring new inspiration to the design of high-energy metal batteries. Graphic Abstract: Anode-free metal batteries can deliver higher energy densities than traditional anode-excess metal batteries and metal-ion batteries. Yet the cycle life of anode-free cells is limited by the non-planar growth and low coulombic efficiency of the metal anodes. In this review, we not only systematically elaborate the working/failure mechanisms and achieved progress for the reported anode-free Li/Na/Zn/Al battery systems, but also propose a series of conceptually-feasible yet unexplored anode-free systems.

Unveiling Role of Sulfate Ion in Nickel-Iron (oxy)Hydroxide with Enhanced Oxygen-Evolving Performance,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe rational design of effective catalysts for sluggish oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) is desired but challenging. Nickel-iron (NiFe) (oxy)hydroxides are promising pre-electrocatalysts for alkaline OER. However, OER performances are limited by the slow reconstruction process to generate active species of high-valance NiFe oxyhydroxides. In this work, a sulfate ion (SO42−) modulated strategy is developed to boost the OER activity of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide by accelerating the electrochemical reconstruction of pre-catalyst and stabilizing the reaction intermediate of OOH* during OER. The SO42− decorated NiFe (oxy)hydroxide catalyst (NF-S0.15) is fabricated via scalable anodization of NiFe foam in a thiourea-dissolved electrolyte. The experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate the dual effect of SO42− on improving OER performances. SO42− leaching is favorable for the electrochemical reconstruction to form active NiFeOOH under OER condition. Simultaneously, the residual SO42− adsorbed on surface can stabilize the intermediate of OOH*, and thus enhance the OER performances. As expected, NF-S0.15 delivers an ultralow overpotential of 234 mV to reach the current density of 50 mA cm−2, a fast OER kinetics (27.7 mV dec−1), and a high stability for more than 100 h. This unique insights into anionic modification could inspire the development of advanced electrocatalysts for efficient OER.",Advanced Functional Materials
Multi-channel sulfurized polyacrylonitrile with hollow structure as cathode for room temperature sodium–sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) has been comprehensively studied as a promising electrode material for sodium–sulfur batteries. However, problems such as low capacity and poor cycle stability still exist in room temperature sodium–sulfur batteries (RT-Na/S batteries). Here, a multi-channel sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (MSPAN) with hollow structure prepared by electrospinning technology was combined with polystyrene (PS) acting as a pore-forming agent, which not only provided a larger specific surface area and enlarged contact between electrode and electrolyte, but also limited the shuttling of polysulfides effectively, thereby improving the reversible specific capacity and rate performance of the electrodes. Through comparing the electrochemical performances of MSPAN on different current collectors, it was found that copper foil as the current collector favored the electrochemical performances of the materials. As a result, the MSPAN-2 used as the cathode for RT-Na/S batteries exhibited a high discharge specific capacity of 314.2 mAh g−1 at a current density of 2 ​A ​g−1.

Negatively charged polymeric interphase for regulated uniform lithium-ion transport in stable lithium metal batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdLi metal anode (LMA) for practical Li-metal batteries suffers from safety hazards and capacity deterioration caused by its high reactivity and infinite volume change. Herein, a stable LMA with highly uniform surface potential distribution was demonstrated by coating Li with a negatively charged artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI), which is formed by spontaneous in-situ polymerization of 2,3,7,8-tetrakis((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline-5,10-dione (PPQ) at room temperature. As an ion-transport regulator, such an ASEI with negatively charged moieties provides preferential Li-ion transport with high Li-ion transference number (tLi+ = 0.74). As a robust artificial layer, the PPQ-stabilized Li (PPQ-Li) maintains high mechanical strength (Young's modulus of 7.39 GPa) after being immersed in electrolyte, which readily suppresses formation of hazardous Li dendrites and diminishes parasitic reactions on LMA, leading to dendrite-free morphology after long-term Li stripping-plating tests. Such a multi-functional interphase could potentially promote more tailorable coating designs for practically durable LMA.",Nano Energy

Boron-doped carbon nanospheres for efficient and stable electrochemical nitrogen reduction,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdElectrochemical reduction of dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) at the ambient condition is a promising alternative to the traditional Haber-Bosch process due its energy-saving and eco-friendly natures. However, the extremely stable N[tbnd]N triple-bonds in N2 molecules and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have been regarded as the two essential issues in the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR), making the simultaneous achievement of a high NH3 yield rate and a satisfactory Faradaic efficiency (FE) very difficult. To address this issue, we herein report a metal-free electrocatalyst, the boron-doped carbon nanosphere, to effectively activate the N[tbnd]N triple-bonds and suppress the HER during the eNRR process. In this protocol, the B–C configurations can be easily tailored by simply changing the boron precursor amount, and the one that is (i.e., BC3) beneficial to the enhancement of eNRR can achieve the maximum relative content of ∼43% in the optimum sample. Under this boron-doping amount, the material simultaneously delivers a high NH3 yield of 33.8 μg h−1 mg−1cat and a high FE of 39.2% at −0.7 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, accompanied with a superior stability for a continuous eNRR. This study thus offers an efficient, stable, and low-cost carbon-based catalyst for eNRR.",Carbon

"Sc, Ge co-doping NASICON boosts solid-state sodium ion batteries' performance","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Solid-state sodium ion batteries (SSSIBs) have been proposed to resolve the safety hazards of traditional liquid batteries. The sodium superionic conductor (NASICON), one of the most promising solid electrolyte candidates, has received much attention. However, the practical use of NASICON has been impeded by low ion mobility at room temperature (RT) and poor interfacial connectivity. Here, the improvement of both bulk and grain boundary conductivity has been achieved simultaneously via Sc and Ge co-doping. Bulk conductivity is increased by the Sc-doping, which increases the stability of the rhombohedral phase at RT, and the Ge-doping, which reduces the monoclinic to rhombohedral phase transformation temperature. The highest total conductivity of 4.64 × 10−3 S cm−1 was obtained for the Na3.125Zr1.75Sc0.125Ge0.125Si2PO12 structure. The improvement in conductivity due to the stabilisation of the rhombohedral phase was verified by DFT calculations. Finally, two different solid-state batteries using Na3V2(PO4)3 and Sn4P3@CNT as electrodes display impressive cycling capacities of 98 and 629 mAh g − 1 after 250 cycles, respectively. This co-doping principle also provides a framework to explore multiple-doping for other materials with similar structures.",Energy Storage Materials

"Quantifying the chemical, electrochemical heterogeneity and spatial distribution of (poly) sulfide species using Operando SANS","© 2021 Elsevier B.V.In-situ and operando measurements are done to gain a better understanding of the precipitation mechanisms during charge and discharge in lithium sulfur batteries. A carbon felt networked with microfibers consisting of pores, 2 nm and smaller, is used as a freestanding sulfur host. Three different methods of sulfur infiltration are explored in order to determine the best one to fill most of the pores. It was identified to be a melt infiltration method in a vacuum oven, where the pores including the ultra-micropores, are successfully filled. In-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements show a solid product formation occurring at the sulfur cathode, both during the high voltage plateau and at the end of discharge. In a 3-electrode EIS measurement, a similar solid product formation on the Li counter electrode due to its reaction with polysulfides is also observed. Operando small angle neutron scattering measurements show the solid product formation, in the carbon, both near the beginning and at the end of discharge, confirming the precipitation data via contrast changes as a function of charge and discharge. It is shown that Li2S precipitates in the pores at the beginning and the end of discharge, whereas S8 precipitates on the surface of the carbon felt. This lithium sulfur system shows both the quasi-solid-state and the solid-liquid-solid reactions in a typical ethereal electrolyte solution with a two-plateau discharge profile.",Energy Storage Materials

In this work, we demonstrate a mineral-derived anode material Cu5FeS4 coated with carbon for both sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries. The findings show that ball milling bornite in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone followed by optimal-temperature carbonization results in S, N-codoped Cu5FeS4 particles with the desired surface properties, enhanced electronic conductivity, and abundant active sites that deliver high reversible capacity and maintain superior long-term cycling performance at a high current density of 2.0 A g−1.

A novel electrolytes for redox flow batteries: Cerium and chromium couples in aqueous system,"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.In this study, Ce/Cr redox flow battery system (RFB), which had redox pair in different oxidation states, was performed in aqueous acidic medium for the first time in the literature. At Ce/Cr RFB system, optimization of acid (H2SO4), and active ion (Cr(III) and Ce(III) ions) concentration were executed by using differential pulse voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy methods. The mass transfer type for positive electrolyte was determined by using of cyclic voltammetric method.

Fe0.8CoSe2 nanosphere coated by N-doped carbon for ultra-high rate potassium selenium battery,"© 2021, Youke Publishing Co.,Ltd.Potassium-selenium (K-Se) batteries are a promising electrical energy storage candidate because of the cost-effectiveness and material sustainability, yet they suffer from shuttle effect, volume expansion and low powder density. The development of Se-based cathode is an effective way to overcome the above issues. Here we designed a hollow nano-spherical Co-Fe bi-metallic selenide coated with N-doped carbon (denoted as CFS@N-C) as cathode for K-Se batteries. Bimetallic selenide is benefit to improve the conductivity of composite materials; N-doped carbon layer encapsulation effectively inhibits the dissolution of poly-selenides and relieves the volume expansion. The as-prepared K-Se battery exhibits excellent rate performance (300 mAh·g–1 at 1000 mA·g–1) and slow-charge/ultrafast-discharge capability (discharge at 5000 mA·g–1 and charge at 100 mA·g–1 with ultrahigh capacity of 227 mAh·g–1) with Coulombic efficiency nearly 100%. In addition, the ex-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images reveal that the charge–discharge mechanism of CFS@N-C is K+ replaces the bimetal and forms K2Se. The unique design in this work may provide certain directions on researching for high power density K-storage materials.",Rare Metals
Tuning the intermediate reaction barriers by a CuPd catalyst to improve the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to C2 products,"© 2021 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of SciencesElectrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising strategy for the utilization of CO2 and intermittent excess electricity. Cu is the only single metal catalyst that can electrochemically convert CO2 into multicarbon products. However, Cu exhibits an unfavorable activity and selectivity for the generation of C2 products because of the insufficient amount of CO* provided for the C-C coupling. Based on the strong CO2 adsorption and ultrafast reaction kinetics of CO* formation on Pd, an intimate CuPd(100) interface was designed to lower the intermediate reaction barriers and improve the efficiency of C2 product formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the CuPd(100) interface enhanced the CO2 adsorption and decreased the CO2* hydrogenation energy barrier, which was beneficial for the C-C coupling. The potential-determining step (PDS) barrier of CO2 to C2 products on the CuPd(100) interface was 0.61 eV, which was lower than that on Cu(100) (0.72 eV). Encouraged by the DFT calculation results, the CuPd(100) interface catalyst was prepared by a facile chemical solution method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy. CO2 temperature-programmed desorption and gas sensor experiments further confirmed the enhancement of the CO2 adsorption and CO2* hydrogenation ability of the CuPd(100) interface catalyst. Specifically, the obtained CuPd(100) interface catalyst exhibited a C2 Faradaic efficiency of 50.3% ± 1.2% at −1.4 VRHE in 0.1 M KHCO3, which was 2.1 times higher than that of the Cu catalyst (23.6% ± 1.5%). This study provides the basis for the rational design of Cu-based electrocatalysts for the generation of multicarbon products by fine-tuning the intermediate reaction barriers.",Chinese Journal of Catalysis
A comprehensive review on recent advances of polyanionic cathode materials in Na-ion batteries for cost effective energy storage applications,"© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Sustainable and efficient energy storage devices are crucial to meet the soaring global energy demand. In this context, Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have emerged as one of the excellent alternatives to the Li-ion batteries, due to the uniform geographical distribution, abundance, cost-effectiveness, comparable operating voltage as well as similar intercalation chemistry. However, due to larger size of Na and other related issues, a subtle strategy of research is required for the development of electrode materials for NIBs to enhance overall electrochemical performance.

Hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbon foams decorated with zinc nanodots as high-performance sulfur hosts for lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2021To prevent polysulfides from dissolution into electrolyte, we propose a novel and simple approach to nitrogen-doped carbon foams which contain hierarchically porous structure and are decorated with zinc nanodots through one-pot carbonization and activation process. These carbon foams, which serve as hosts for sulfur in lithium battery, can provide a conducting network and shorter diffusion length for Li-ions. Specially, the zinc nanodots derived from the carbothermal reaction of ZnCl2 at high temperature can interact with sulfur/polysulfides by strong chemisorption. In addition, the zinc nanodots can also facilitate the conversion reaction between Li2Sx (2 < x < 8) and Li2S/Li2S2. Therefore, Zn@NCFs/S cathode presents high sulfur utility and large capacity.",Chinese Chemical Letters
CoS2needle arrays induced a local pseudo-acidic environment for alkaline hydrogen evolution,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a potential way to realize industrial hydrogen production. However, the sluggish process of H2O dissociation, as well as the accumulation of OH- around the active sites, seriously limit the alkaline HER performance. In this work, we developed a unique CoS2 needle array grown on a carbon cloth (NAs@C) electrode as an alkaline HER catalyst. Finite-element simulations revealed that CoS2 needle arrays (NAs) induce stronger local electric field (LEF) than CoS2 disordered needles (DNs). This LEF can greatly repel the local OH- around the active sites, and then promote the forward H2O dissociation process. The local pH changes of the electrode surface confirmed the lower OH- concentration and stronger local pseudo-acidic environment of NAs@C compared to those of DNs@C. As a result, the NAs@C catalyst exhibited a low HER overpotential of 121 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH, with the Tafel slope of 59.87 mV dec-1. This work provides a new insight into nanoneedle arrays for the alkaline HER by electric field-promoted H2O dissociation.",Nanoscale
Rechargeable Na/Cl2 and Li/Cl2 batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in applications ranging from electric vehicles to wearable devices. Before the invention of secondary LIBs, the primary lithium-thionyl chloride (Li-SOCl2) battery was developed in the 1970s using SOCl2 as the catholyte, lithium metal as the anode and amorphous carbon as the cathode1–7. This battery discharges by lithium oxidation and catholyte reduction to sulfur, sulfur dioxide and lithium chloride, is well known for its high energy density and is widely used in real-world applications; however, it has not been made rechargeable since its invention8–13. Here we show that with a highly microporous carbon positive electrode, a starting electrolyte composed of aluminium chloride in SOCl2 with fluoride-based additives, and either sodium or lithium as the negative electrode, we can produce a rechargeable Na/Cl2 or Li/Cl2 battery operating via redox between mainly Cl2/Cl− in the micropores of carbon and Na/Na+ or Li/Li+ redox on the sodium or lithium metal. The reversible Cl2/NaCl or Cl2/LiCl redox in the microporous carbon affords rechargeability at the positive electrode side and the thin alkali-fluoride-doped alkali-chloride solid electrolyte interface stabilizes the negative electrode, both are critical to secondary alkali-metal/Cl2 batteries.",Nature
Synergistic Flame Retardancy of Microcapsules Based on Ammonium Polyphosphate and Aluminum Hydroxide for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.Flame retardants have important theoretical research and applied value for lithium-ion battery safety. Microcapsule flame retardants based on ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and aluminum hydroxide (ATH) were synthesized for application in lithium-ion batteries. First, the ATH-APP was prepared by coating a layer of ATH on the surface of the core APP. Then, the ATH-APP was encapsulated by poly(urea-formaldehyde) (PUF) to obtain en-ATH-APP. The structure and flame-retardant property of en-ATH-APP, the influence of en-ATH-APP on the thermal stability of the electrode, and the electrochemical performance of the battery were studied. The results of Fourier transform infrared and scanning electron microscope experiments indicated that APP was coated with ATH and PUF in turn. The results of differential scanning calorimetry and the fire extinguishing test for electrodes manifested that en-ATH-APP had better flame-retardant property than APP because of the synergistic effect between APP and ATH. Moreover, the flame-retardant efficiency of en-ATH-APP was comparable to that of ATH-APP, indicating that the presence of PUF had almost no effect on the flame-retardant property. The results of electrochemical experiments indicated that en-ATH-APP had the best electrochemical compatibility for the battery compared with APP and ATH-APP. The research lights the way to improve inherent safety of lithium-ion batteries by adding en-ATH-APP to the cathode.",ACS Omega

Viscoelastic polyborosiloxanes as artificial solid electrolyte interphase on lithium metal anodes,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdLithium metal is considered as outstanding anode material due to its superior specific capacity and high redox potential, despite that non-uniform lithium deposition and dissolution upon charging and discharging yields formation of reactive high surface area lithium (HSAL) and a brittle, inhomogeneous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). As counterstrategy, artificial SEIs such as protective polymer layers can be designed to control lithium deposition. Herein, viscoelastic polyborosiloxanes (PBS) with varying degree of cross-linking (maximum storage modulus of 0.4 MPa) are synthesized and coated on lithium metal. Operando 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy illustrates that highly cross-linked PBS facilitates homogenous deposit morphologies, whereas merely cross-linked PBS does not show relevant effects compared to uncoated electrodes. Interphase analysis (impedance spectroscopy and distribution of relaxation times analysis) reveals increased interphase resistances for coated Li electrodes due to limited solvent uptake and provides a more detailed evaluation of resistive contributions from interphases compared to common equivalent circuit modeling. The beneficial effects of highly cross-linked PBS come at expense of higher resistance associated with a lower degree of swelling, hence emphasizing the complexity of Li deposition.",Electrochimica Acta
Atomically dispersed S-Fe-N4 for fast kinetics sodium-sulfur batteries via a dual function mechanism,"© 2021 The AuthorsRoom-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries have significant potential for large-scale applications due to the low cost and high energy density of both sulfur and sodium. Nevertheless, the insulating nature of sulfur and the shuttle effect are impeding their practical application. Here we report that dispersed single-atom Fe sites anchored on a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix present an atomic-level strategy for the development of sulfur hosts. The electronic structure of sulfur is modified by the atomically dispersed Fe-N4 sites, which can transfer the electron to sulfur, thereby enhancing its reactivity. The S@Fe1-NMC cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 1,650 mAh g−1 initially and 540 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 100 mA g−1. A dual function mechanism is observed on S-Fe-N4 sites, which can activate the polysulfides by weakening the S-S bonds and accelerate Na+ diffusion into Na-poor regions to engender a high driving force for Na2Sx decomposition, thus inhibiting the shuttle effect.",Cell Reports Physical Science
Electrochemical release of catalysts in nanoreactors for solid sulfur redox reactions in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 The Author(s)Electrocatalysis-assisted entrapment of polysulfide while ensuring efficient nucleation of Na2S holds the key to addressing the shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics of polysulfide in room-temperature (RT) Na/S batteries. The constrained active sites, however, dramatically limit the efficiency of electrocatalysts. Here, a strategy of electrochemically releasing nano-silver catalytic sites during the discharge process is presented, visualized, and implemented for accelerated Na2S nucleation. Because of the effective polysulfide immobilization and accelerated Na2S nucleation, the sulfur cathode, supported by a self-released silver electrocatalyst, exhibits a superior reversible capacity of 701 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and an ultra-stable cycling performance. Precise understanding of the electrochemically self-releasing mechanism and the catalysis in Na2S nucleation via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) would aid, however, in fundamentally optimizing the working mechanism and for further development of more stable high-power RT Na/S batteries.",Cell Reports Physical Science

Herein, the terephthalic acid etched stepwise hollow bulky PB cubes and the intimate contact mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) particles with the adhered minisize PB cubes can together build continuous conductive networks. The composite (donated as N-PB@CMK) has high electrical conductivity, low resistance, and ultrahigh specific surface, which can lead to high capacitive contribution ratios. The N-PB@CMK electrode can deliver a discharge capacity of 120 mAh g-1 and maintain retention of 85.0% after cycling for 200 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. Even cycling at 1 A g-1, the reversible capacity can be measured to 102 mAh g-1 and exhibit stability over a long cycle. In situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were further measured to illustrate the phase transition of crystal structure along with the extraction/insertion processes of Na+ ions. Especially, the assembled full cell with NaTi2(PO4)3@C anode can also show good stability and provide promising insights of applying the N-PB@CMK for energy storage systems in the future.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Phenylpyridine Dicarboxylate as Highly Efficient Organic Anode for Na-Ion Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe sodium-ion battery (SIB) has the potential to be the next-generation rechargeable system, utilizing cheap and abundant sodium material. One of the key obstacles to sodium batteries is the lack of efficient and stable anode materials. Compared with traditional inorganic electrode materials, organic materials are more attractive because of their easier sodium transport accessibility and the diversities of organic frameworks and functional groups. In this work, two molecules (Na-CPN and Na-CPP) were synthesized and used as anode materials for SIBs. Structurally, the two compounds are isomers, and they are distinguished by the position of N atoms in phenylpyridine. Na-CPP showed a high reversible capacity of 197 mAh g−1, and its capacity could maintain 99.1 % of its initial value even after 350 cycles of 100 mA g−1. Moreover, after going through 1200 cycles at a current density of 5 C, the Na-CPP electrode still retained a capacity rate of 89.9 %. In contrast, Na-CPN exhibited inferior capacity and rate performance because of its larger polarization, particle size, and charge transport resistance.",ChemSusChem
Low-Melting-Point Ionic Liquid Electrolyte for an Intermediate-Temperature Sodium-Copper Chloride Battery,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Sodium-metal chloride batteries are usually operated at a relatively high temperature (270-350 °C) to achieve adequate electrochemical performance. Such a high operating temperature may cause several issues and limit their widespread applications. Lowering the operating temperature may alleviate these issues, which can be achieved by reducing the ohmic resistance of a Na-β″-Al2O3 solid electrolyte (BASE) and incorporating a low-melting-point catholyte. Herein, a planar sodium-copper chloride battery is evaluated at intermediate temperatures (from 100 to 175 °C) with a thin BASE disk (500 μm) and a room-Temperature ionic liquid (RTIL). The RTILs at various concentrations (0.1-0.75 mol L-1) are prepared by dissolving different amounts of sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfon)imide (NaTFSI) into 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIm][TFSI]) and used as the catholyte. The effect of NaTFSI addition in [EMIm][TFSI] on the physical properties of the catholyte is examined. With 0.5 mol L-1 NaTFSI in [EMIm][TFSI] ionic liquid to assemble the Na/CuCl2 battery, the fabricated cell delivers a capacity up to 146.5 mAh g-1 when cycled at 175 °C with the current density of 2 mA cm-2 and retains 94.5% capacity after 20 cycles. Moreover, the battery can run steadily at 130 °C and show a reversible capacity of 79.2 mAh g-1 when the operation temperature is set as low as 100 °C. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest operation temperatures reported thus far for sodium-metal-chloride-based cells.",Energy and Fuels
Easy encapsulation of Sn4P3 nanoparticles into honeycomb-like nitrogen-doped carbon matrix with enhanced electrochemical performance for Li-ion batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Tin phosphide (Sn4P3) has arisen to be an anode material toward lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with great potential for its high theoretic Li-storage capacity. Nevertheless, unavoidable capacity fading as well as poor rate capability have severely hindered the extended application of Sn4P3. In this paper, a hierarchical hybrid (Sn4P3-NC) has been fabricated by an easy freeze-drying followed by an annealing and phosphorization treatment. In this hybrid, Sn4P3 nanoparticles are well encapsulated into honeycomb-like nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks. Porous carbon provides multiple electron expressway and robust mechanical support. Furthermore, Sn4P3 nanoparticles are well confined in carbon matrix so as to effectively alleviate the volume expansion. Having profited from the desirable nanostructures and significantly enhanced synergetic effect, Sn4P3-NC as an anode for LIB achieves an extremely improved electrochemical property. A high capacity of ~881 mAh g−1 could be retained after 150 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and an enhanced rate and cycle performance with the discharge capacity of ~507 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 through 400 cycles is also exhibited.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Mechanistic Insights into Interactions of Polysulfides at VS2Interfaces in Na-S Batteries: A DFT Study,"© Room temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries, because of their high theoretical energy density and low cost, are considered as a promising candidate for next-generation energy storage devices. However, the practical utilization of the Na-S batteries is greatly hindered by various deleterious factors such as dissolution of sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn) into the electrolyte commonly termed as ""shuttle effect,""sluggish decomposition of solid Na2S, and poor electronic conductivity of sulfur. To overcome the challenges, we introduced single-layer vanadium disulfide (VS2) as an anchoring material (AM) to immobilize higher-order polysulfides from the dissolution and also to accelerate the otherwise sluggish kinetics of insoluble short-chain polysulfides. We employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the Na2Sn interactions at the VS2 interfaces. We show that the adsorption strengths of various Na2Sn species on the VS2 basal plane are adequate (1.21-4.3 eV) to suppress the shuttle effect, and the structure of Na2Sn are maintained without any decomposition, which is necessary to mitigate capacity fading. The calculated projected density of states (PDOS) reveals that the metallic character of the pristine VS2 is retained even after Na2Sn adsorption. The calculated Gibbs free energy of each elementary sulfur reduction reaction indicates a significant decrement in the free energy barrier due to the catalytic activity of the VS2 surface. Furthermore, VS2 is found to be an excellent catalyst to significantly reduce the oxidative decomposition barrier of Na2S, which facilitates accelerated electrode kinetics and higher utilization of sulfur. Overall, VS2 with strong adsorption behavior, enhanced electronic conductivity, and improved oxidative decomposition kinetics of polysulfides can be considered as an effective AM to prevent the shuttle effect and to improve the performance of Na-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Improving Room Temperature Ionic Conductivity of Na3- xKxZr2Si2PO12Solid-Electrolytes: Effects of Potassium Substitution,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.The battery safety and cost remain major challenges for developing next-generation rechargeable batteries. All-solid-state sodium (Na)-ion batteries are a promising option for low-cost as well as safe rechargeable batteries by using abundant resources and solid electrolytes. However, the operation of solid-state batteries is limited due to the low ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes. Therefore, it is essential to develop new compounds that feature a high ionic conductivity and chemical stability at room temperature. Herein, we report a potassium-substituted sodium superionic conductor solid electrolyte, Na3-xKxZr2Si2PO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2), that exhibits an ionic conductivity of 7.734 × 10-4 S/cm-1 at room temperature, which is more than 2 times higher than that of the undoped sample. The synchrotron powder diffraction patterns with Rietveld refinements revealed that the substitution of large K-ions resulted in an increased unit cell volume, widened the Na diffusion channel, and shortened the Na-Na distance. Our work demonstrates that substituting a larger cation on the Na site effectively widens the ion diffusion channel and consequently increases the bulk ionic conductivity. Our findings will contribute to improving the ionic conductivity of the solid electrolytes and further developing safe next-generation rechargeable batteries.",Inorganic Chemistry

Ambient Temperature Sodium Polysulfide Catholyte for Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries,"© 2021 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS""). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.This study reports a sodium polysulfide catholyte for nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). We demonstrate reversible capacities up to 200 mAh/gS with negligible fade over 250 cycles at room temperature for sodium polysulfide|biphenyl full cells containing Na+ß″-Al2O3 solid electrolyte (BASE) membranes. Interestingly, formation of insoluble S and Na2S4 phases did not inhibit the catholyte's cycle life which is likely due to the low concentrations used in the lab-scale prototypes. 3-electrode galvanostatic AC impedance measurements demonstrate that voltage losses were dominated by charge transfer at the cathode, and relevant kinetic parameters (i.e., transfer coefficients and exchange current density) were calculated through a Tafel analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report applying such an impedance approach to nonaqueous RFBs. Overall, the use of low-cost active materials makes sodium polysulfide|biphenyl RFBs promising for long duration energy storage applications. If strategies are developed to increase the solubility of S and/or low order polysulfides (Na2Sx, x ≤ 4), specific energies up to 100 Wh kg-1 (including combined mass of the anolyte and catholyte) can be achieved.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society

Liquid metal batteries for future energy storage,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The search for alternatives to traditional Li-ion batteries is a continuous quest for the chemistry and materials science communities. One representative group is the family of rechargeable liquid metal batteries, which were initially exploited with a view to implementing intermittent energy sources due to their specific benefits including their ultrafast electrode charge-transfer kinetics and their ability to resist microstructural electrode degradation. Although conventional liquid metal batteries require high temperatures to liquify electrodes, and maintain the high conductivity of molten salt electrolytes, the degrees of electrochemical irreversibility induced by their corrosive active components emerged as a drawback. In addition, safety issues caused by the complexity of parasitic chemical reactivities at high temperatures further complicated their practical applications. To address these challenges, new paradigms for liquid metal batteries operated at room or intermediate temperatures are explored to circumvent the thermal management problems, corrosive reactions, and challenges related to hermetic sealing, by applying alternative electrodes, manipulating the underlying electrochemical behavior via electrolyte design concepts, and engineering the electrode-electrolyte interfaces, thereby enabling both conventional and completely new functionalities. This report briefly summarizes previous research on liquid metal batteries and, in particular, highlights our fresh understanding of the electrochemistry of liquid metal batteries that have arisen from researchers' efforts, along with discovered hurdles that have been realized in reformulated cells. Finally, the feasibility of new liquid metal batteries is discussed along with their distinct chemistries and performance characteristics to answer the question of how liquid metals can be accessible for next-generation battery systems.

Recent advanced skeletons in sodium metal anodes,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The sodium metal anode exhibits great potential in next-generation high-energy-density batteries due to its high theoretical capacity (1165 mA h g-1) at low redox potential (-2.71 V versus standard hydrogen electrode) as well as the high natural abundance and low cost of Na resources. However, its practical application in rechargeable batteries is hindered by uncontrollable dendrite growth that leads to poor coulombic efficiency, short lifespan, infinite volume change and even safety issues during plating/stripping processes. Among various strategies, the application of skeletons for Na metal anodes demonstrates a positive influence on reducing local current density, inhibiting dendrite growth, and alleviating volume expansion. This work reviews the research progress of various skeleton materials for sodium metal anodes in recent years, including carbon-based skeletons, alloy-based skeletons, metallic skeletons and MXene-based skeletons. Simultaneously, the recent technological advances and strategies are summarized and categorized. Finally, we discuss the development prospects and research strategies of skeleton materials in sodium metal anodes from the perspective of basic research and practical applications.

Research progress on graphene-based materials for high-performance lithium-metal batteries 石墨烯基材料在高性能锂金属电池中的研究进展,"© 2021, Science Press. All right reserved.Due to their relatively low energy density, commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have faced difficulty in meeting the increasing requirements of energy storage devices for portable electronics and electric vehicles. Lithium (Li) with a high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g−1) and low density (0.59 g cm−3) is regarded as one of the best anodes for next-generation high energy density Li metal batteries, e.g., Li-S and Li-O2 batteries. However, the safety problems induced by uncontrollable Li dendrite growth and a low Coulombic efficiency caused by an unstable solid electrolyte interphase layer, have limited their practical application. Graphene-based materials (GBMs) with a high specific surface area and controllable structures and chemical properties, have been shown to be important in solving these problems. Various protection strategies for Li metal anodes using GBMs are summarized and the design of GBMs with different roles and functions in Li metal protection is discussed.

"Review on comparison of different energy storage technologies used in micro-energy harvesting, wsns, low-cost microelectronic devices: Challenges and recommendations","© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This paper reviews energy storage systems, in general, and for specific applications in low-cost micro-energy harvesting (MEH) systems, low-cost microelectronic devices, and wireless sensor networks (WSNs). With the development of electronic gadgets, low-cost microelectronic devices and WSNs, the need for an efficient, light and reliable energy storage device is increased. The current energy storage systems (ESS) have the disadvantages of self-discharging, energy density, life cycles, and cost. The ambient energy resources are the best option as an energy source, but the main challenge in harvesting energy from ambient sources is the instability of the source of energy. Due to the explosion of lithium batteries in many cases, and the pros associated with them, the design of an efficient device, which is more reliable and efficient than conventional batteries, is important. This review paper focused on the issues of the reliability and performance of electrical ESS, and, especially, discussed the technical challenges and suggested solutions for ESS (batteries, supercapacitors, and for a hybrid combination of supercapacitors and batteries) in detail. Nowadays, the main market of batteries is WSNs, but in the last decade, the world’s attention has turned toward supercapacitors as a good alternative of batteries. The main advantages of supercapacitors are their light weight, volume, greater life cycle, turbo charging/discharging, high energy density and power density, low cost, easy maintenance, and no pollution. This study reviews supercapacitors as a better alternative of batteries in low-cost electronic devices, WSNs, and MEH systems.",Sensors
Recent advances on pre-sodiation in sodium-ion capacitors: A mini review,"© 2021Rechargeable sodium-based energy storage devices have attracted much attention in recent years due to high abundance and even global distribution of sodium resources. As a new member of the sodium-storage family, sodium-ion capacitors (SICs) are expected to supplement lithium-based energy storage devices because they combine advantages of both sodium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. However, the absence of a sodium source in electrode materials, the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) during the first cycle and the loss of sodium ions during long-term cycles will have a fatal impact on the performance of a typical SIC. It is currently recognized that the effective approach is to perform the pre-sodiation process. Although the research on pre-lithiation of lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) has been widely reported, the related research in SICs has not received sufficient attention. This work will systematically summarize the pre-sodiation methods of SICs, and further to give some in-depth insights to the future research of SICs towards practical applications.",Electrochemistry Communications
Size Effect of Organosulfur and In Situ Formed Oligomers Enables High-Utilization Na–Organosulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHOrganosulfurs are promising cathode materials for rechargeable metal batteries due to their high capacities, diverse structures, and electrochemical properties. Herein, the electrochemical behavior of three organosulfur compounds, i.e., 4,4′-thiobisbenzenethiol (TBBT), 1,4-benzenedithiol (1,4-BDT), and diphenyl disulfide (DPDS), is revealed in room-temperature rechargeable sodium (Na) batteries, which show significantly improved performances when sodiated Nafion membranes are used. Large oligomers of organosulfur can be formed during charging, and they are readily blocked by the nanosized ion-conducting clusters in the Nafion membrane. In addition, large organosulfur monomers can also be blocked. Only 5.4% of TBBT diffuses through the Nafion membrane after 800 h. The Na|TBBT cell sustains 77% of the theoretical capacity after 300 cycles (2420 h). Moreover, the Na|TBBT redox flow cell shows promising rechargeability. Due to the medium molecular size, the organosulfur oligomers are expected to provide a new avenue to develop high-capacity chalcogen cathodes, besides inorganic S and S-containing polymers.",Advanced Materials
S-Decorated Porous Ti3C2 MXene Combined with In Situ Forming Cu2Se as Effective Shuttling Interrupter in Na–Se Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHGiven natural abundance of Na and superior kinetics of Se, Na–Se batteries have attracted much attention but still face the problem of shuttling effect of soluble intermediates. The first-principle calculations reveal the S-decorated Ti3C2 exhibits increased binding energy to sodium polyselenides, suggesting a better capture and restriction on intermediates. The obtained Se@S-decorated porous Ti3C2 (Se@S-P-Ti3C2) exhibits a high reversible capacity of 765 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 (calculated based on Se), ≈1.2, 1.3, and 1.7 times of Se@porous Ti3C2 (Se@P-Ti3C2), Se@Ti3C2, and Se, respectively. It gives considerable capacity of 664 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1 and impressive cycling stability over 2300 cycles with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.003% per cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the S-modified porous Ti3C2, which provides effective immobilization toward polyselenides, makes full use of nanosized Se, and alleviates volume expansion during sodiation/desodiation. Additionally, in situ forming Cu2Se can generate Cu nanoparticles through discharge process and then transform polyselenides into solid-phase Cu2Se, further suppressing the shuttling effect. This work provides a practical strategy to immobilize and transform sodium polyselenides for high-capacity and long-life Na–Se batteries.",Advanced Materials
Metal–Organic Frameworks-Derived Nitrogen-Doped Porous Carbon Nanocubes with Embedded Co Nanoparticles as Efficient Sulfur Immobilizers for Room Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHRoom temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries are considered a promising candidate for energy-storage due to their high energy-density and low-cost. However, the shutting effect of polysulfides and sluggish kinetics of sulfur redox reactions still severely limit their practical implementation. Herein, a new type of 3D hierarchical porous carbonaceous nanocubes is reported as efficient sulfur hosts, composed of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and Co nanoparticles (NPs) uniformly embedded into a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (NC). Because of the high specific surface area, large degree of graphitization, and the synergetic effects between Co NPs and N-doping, the as-designed CNTs/Co@NC electrodes not only significantly increase polysulfides immobilization, but also efficiently catalyze sulfur redox reactions, as confirmed by experimental results and DFT calculations. When tested in a RT Na–S battery, the S@CNTs/Co@NC-0.25 cathode demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance, achieving high initial specific capacity of 1200.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, remarkable rate capability up to 5.0 C (474.2 mAh g−1), and superior cyclic performance of 450.5 mAh g−1 (292 mAh g−1) after 400 cycles at 1.0 C (5.0 C). The integration of a 3D hierarchical porous architecture with well-dispersed Co NPs of an electro-catalyst provides valuable insights based on structure-adsorption-catalysis engineering for advanced RT Na–S batteries.",Small Methods
Electrode performance of amorphous MoS3 in all-solid-state sodium secondary batteries,"© 2021 The AuthorsAll-solid-state Na–S secondary batteries that use sodium and sulfur, both available in abundance, are the most attractive next-generation batteries. In this study, two types of amorphous MoS3 (a-MoS3) were prepared as electrode active materials for use in all-solid-state sodium secondary batteries using the thermal decomposition (TD) of (NH4)2MoS4 and mechanochemical (MC) processes, denoted a-MoS3 (TD) and a-MoS3 (MC), respectively. X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that a-MoS3 (TD) and a-MoS3 (MC) had different local structures. The a-MoS3 (TD) and a-MoS3 (MC) electrodes showed high reversible capacities of 310 mAh g−1 and 260 mAh g−1, respectively, for five cycles in all-solid-state sodium secondary batteries. XPS analysis of the discharge–charge products suggested that the dissociation and formation of disulfide bonds occurred during the discharge–charge reaction. The results show that a-MoS3 is a promising active electrode material for all-solid-state sodium batteries.",Journal of Power Sources Advances
Achieving Efficient Magnesium–Sulfur Battery Chemistry via Polysulfide Mediation,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHMagnesium–sulfur batteries promise a higher theoretical volumetric energy density, improved safety, and lower cost compared to lithium–sulfur batteries. However, Mg–S batteries suffer from poor cycle life and low energy efficiency. Here, it is revealed that Mg–S reactions are dominated by “solid–solid” reactions due to much lower polysulfide solubility in the presence of Mg2+ compared to that of Li+ in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME)-based electrolyte, leading to sluggish kinetics and poor reversibility. The polysulfide solubility is increased by using high-donor-number solvents (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)), which increases the discharge capacity from 660 to ≈1500 mAh g−1 and decreases the sulfur overpotential from >600 to ≈200 mV at 0.1 C (energy efficiency over 90%). Based on this strategy, an Mg–S cathode with DMSO-based electrolyte demonstrates a reversible capacity of 700 mAh g−1 at 0.4 C over 300 cycles. This work reveals a reaction limitation of Mg–S batteries and provides critical insights into the electrolyte design for high-energy and reversible Mg–S batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials
Employing the Dynamics of the Electrochemical Interface in Aqueous Zinc-Ion Battery Cathodes,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHIntrinsically stable materials are desirable for constructing energy storage devices, which aim to demonstrate durability under the harsh electrochemical conditions that are detrimental to their lifespan. However, it is demonstrated here that the intrinsic instability of an electrochemical interface can be converted from an obstacle into an advantage. In aqueous zinc-ion batteries, manganese oxide (MnO2) exhibits considerable dissolution even in electrolyte containing Mn2+ salt. Balancing with redeposition alleviates the harmful impact of dissolution on performance and alters the trajectory of the active phase. Inclusion of Mn2+ salt in the electrolyte induces MnO2 deposition on all conductive surfaces, requiring that distracting side reactions be eliminated to isolate the dynamics of the active phase. Under conditions favoring dissolution, capacity decreases dramatically and a highly crystalline tetragonal ZnMn2O4 phase forms, while redeposition helps maintain capacity and promotes a disordered cubic Zn-rich phase. Ultimately, this work aims to illuminate a path forward to unlock the potential of batteries made with materials that are fundamentally unstable in their operating environment.",Advanced Functional Materials

During the charge/discharge process, the sulfur can react with sodium via a multistep redox reaction to obtain a high specific capacity (1675 mA h g−1). However, these batteries face the difficult challenge of the “shuttle effect,” which hinders their practical application. Many strategies have been employed to address this issue on sulfur electrodes, such as intact physical confinement, chemical inhibition, and electrocatalysis.

Reversible Switching of Battery Internal Resistance Using Iongate Separators,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHBattery separators are a critical component that greatly determine cell calendar life and safety. Generally, these separators are passive with no ability to reversibly change their properties in order to optimize battery performance. Here, an iongate separator is demonstrated, which allows ion transport while in the oxidized “on” state but limits ion transport when switched to the reduced “off” state. This is achieved by depositing a dense 300 nm thin film of polypyrrole:polydopamine (PPy:PDA) on a conventional polyolefin separator. By using this iongate separator as a third electrode, a rapid and reversible order of magnitude increase of iongate resistance is achievable. The iongate battery shows similar cycling performance to a normal battery while in the “on” state, but cycling can be reversibly shut-off when the iongate separator is reduced to the “off” state. During elevated temperature storage with the iongate separator in the “off” state, battery capacity loss is decreased by 37% and transition metal crossover is greatly suppressed when compared to a normal battery without the iongate. Additionally, rapid shut-off during discharge is demonstrated by directly shorting the iongate separator to the anode.",Advanced Functional Materials
Architecting Freestanding Sulfur Cathodes for Superior Room-Temperature Na–S Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHRoom-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries have attracted extensive attention because of their low cost and high specific energy. RT Na–S batteries, however, usually suffer from sluggish reaction kinetics, low reversible capacity, and short lifespans. Herein, it is shown that chain-mail catalysts, consisting of porous nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) encapsulating Co nanoparticles (Co@PCNFs), can activate sulfur via electron engineering. The chain-mail catalysts Co@PCNFs with a micrograde hierarchical structure as a freestanding sulfur cathode (Co@PCNFs/S) can provide space for high mass loading of sulfur and polysulfides. The electrons can rapidly transfer from chain-mail catalysts to sulfur and polysulfides during discharge–charge processes, therefore boosting its conversion kinetics. As a result, this freestanding Co@PCNFs/S cathode achieves a high sulfur loading of 2.1 ± 0.2 mg cm−2, delivering a high reversible capacity of 398 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C (1 C = 1675 mA g−1) over 600 cycles and superior rate capability of an average capacity of 240 mA h g−1 at 5 C. Experimental results, combined with density functional theory calculations, demonstrate that the Co@PCNFs/S can efficiently improve the conversion kinetics between the polysulfides and Na2S via transferring electrons from Co to them, thereby realizing efficient sulfur redox reactions.",Advanced Functional Materials
Recent Advances in Application of Ionic Liquids in Electrolyte of Lithium Ion Batteries,"© 2021Lithium ion Batteries (LiBs), as one of the most widely and primarily battery, have been playing an irreplaceable role in human life. They are not only essential for portable electronics, but also playing the dominant and prospective roles in the global effort to tackle the challenges of the renewable energy supply and air pollution at the same time. However, most LiBs assemble with organic solvent-based liquid electrolytes possessing the drawback of volatile, flammable and low decomposition temperature, so it suffers from toxicity, flammability, potential leakage, even explosion accidents when the LiBs are exposed to harsh conditions such as internal short circuits, high temperature and cell crush. To address those safety issues of organic liquid electrolytes, various ionic liquids (ILs) are used in the preparations of electrolytes for LiBs. In this article, a few application of ILs are reviewed by focusing on their use as electrolyte materials for LiBs. Due to their characteristic properties such as nonvolatility, inflammability, high thermal stability, and high ionic conductivity, ILs appear to meet the rigorous demands of the applications involved in liquid electrolytes, polymer composed electrolytes, and polymerized ionic liquids (PILs) composed electrolytes. Herein, the preparation, characteristic, the latest developments, and the perspective of potential application of those electrolytes comprised one or all of ILs and PILs in electrochemical storage devices which clearly focus on LiBs are summarized and discussed. Finally, the main challenges and perspective of ILs-based or ILs-PILs-based electrolytes are illustrated at the end of this review.",Journal of Energy Storage

How to avoid dendrite formation in metal batteries: Innovative strategies for dendrite suppression,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdWith increasing the diversity of electronic/electric appliances and large-scale energy storage systems, high-energy-density based device technology has been in great demand. Meanwhile, for developing of high-voltage and high-capacity cathode, the use of metals including lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), or zinc (Zn) is quite impressive to replace the traditional anodes with low capacity upper limit such as graphite, silicon carbon, and hard carbon which is considered as “holy grail” strategy to explore high-energy density systems. However, these so-called metal batteries (MBs) also face many thorny issues including high anode reactivity, dendritic growth, and high safety risks. Among all these muddle, the dendrite growth is quite sever issue and has attracted much attention of many recognized materials scientist and battery researchers. The formation of dendrite increase the surface area of metal anodes, induce the rupture and reconstruction of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film, which is likely to accelerate the excessive consumption of electrolyte and the formation of dead metals. Consequently, battery lose its capability and short circuit produced which causes serious safety issues. Therefore, it is badly needed to inhibit or even eliminate the formation of dendrites during the repeated charge and discharge process to find advanced and fast battery technology. In this review, we summarize the basic mechanistic theoretical models about dendrites formation and their effects on the battery performance. Moreover, we recapitulate the reported literature about dendrites concept and their solution from battery invention to its modernism for smart electric appliances and zero emission electric vehicles. Besides, perspective of interface energy/volume stress, several innovative strategies for restraining, regulating and eliminating dendrites are also part of this review. Finally, perspectives conclusions for the development of MBs about dendrite level are given for the progress of future battery science.",Nano Energy

Optimizing inner voids in yolk-shell TiO2 nanostructure for high-performance and ultralong-life lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.A TiO2 nanosheets constructed yolk-shell architecture with tunable inner voids is designed and prepared as sulfur host for high-performance and ultralong-life Li-S battery. With the integration of TiO2 nanosheets to form yolk-shell sulfur-TiO2 (S@void@TiO2) architecture with controllable inner voids, the S@void@TiO2 composite with optimized inner voids provides sufficient contacting sites to improve the utilization of insulating sulfur and allows sulfur to freely expand without destroying the electrode. In particular, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations from molecular level reveal that the hybridization of Li 1s, S 2p and O 2p orbitals ensures the effective chemisorption between polysulfides and TiO2 with long-term cycling stability. Consequently, the optimized S@void@TiO2 electrode maintains a capacity of 766 mAhg−1 after 1000 cycles at 0.2C.

Enabling high-performance sodium metal anode via a presodiated alloy-induced interphase,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Irreversible plating/stripping process induces the dendritic/mossy Na growth and cracks propagation, which hinder the practical utilization of sodium metal anode. Herein, a heterogeneous interfacial layer, which composed of the carbon-coated ZnO microflowers and the encapsulated Sb nanocrystals (Sb@ZMF/C), is employed to optimize the cycling stability. Upon the voltage-induced presodiation process, the sodiophilic species in-situ transform into the Na-Zn and Na-Sb intermediates and preferentially induce the metallic plating process, mitigating the nucleation overpotential without sacrificing the energy density; while the microflower substrate spatially accommodates the deposit propagation over the repetitive plating/stripping cycling. Consequently, the Sb@ZMF/C dramatically reduces the nucleation barrier to one-third that of the bare Cu foil (4 mV vs. 12 mV at 0.5 mA cm−2) and obtains satisfactory coulombic efficiency values (>99.5%) even at the high rates. Besides, the in-situ presodiation of the Sb@ZMF/C composite allows the stable Na plating/stripping cycling in energy-dense full-cell evaluations (paired with the NASICON type NaVPO4F cathode). The impressive energy/power densities (251.5 W h kg−1 at 1257.5 W kg−1) realized in the prototype construction, coupled with a facile voltage-induced presodiation process, suggest a feasible strategy to extend the performance limits of metal battery systems.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Perspective on ultramicroporous carbon as sulphur host for Li–S batteries,"© 2020 Science PressLithium–sulphur (Li–S) batteries are currently considered as next-generation battery technology. Sulphur is an attractive positive electrode for lithium metal batteries, mainly due to its high capacity (1675 mAh g−1) and high specific energy (2600 Wh kg−1). The electrochemical reaction of lithium with sulphur in non-aqueous electrolytes results in the formation of electrolyte soluble intermediate lithium–polysulphides. The dissolved polysulphides shuttle to the anode and get reduced at the anode resulting in Li metal corrosion. The solubility of polysulphide gradually reduces the amount of sulphur in the cathode, thereby limiting the cycle life of Li–S batteries. Several strategies have been proposed to improve the cycling stability of Li–S batteries. A unique approach to eliminate the polysulphide shuttle is to use ultramicroporous carbon (UMC) as a host for sulphur. The pore size of UMC which is below 7 Å, is the bottleneck for carbonate solvents to access sulphur/polysulphides confined in the pores, thereby preventing the polysulphide dissolution. This perspective article will emphasise the role of UMC host in directing the lithiation mechanism of sulphur and in inhibiting polysulphide dissolution, including the resulting parasitic reaction on the lithium anode. Further, the challenges that need to be addressed by UMC-S based Li–S batteries, and the strategies to realise high power density, high Coulombic efficiency, and resilient Li–S batteries will be discussed.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Thermal effect on the pseudocapacitive behavior of high-performance flexible supercapacitors based on polypyrrole-decorated carbon cloth electrodes,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2021.With the ongoing advance of flexible energy storage products for commercial portable electronics application, the fundamental comprehension of the temperature-dependence for supercapacitors is in urgent demand. Although polypyrrole (PPy) has been extensively employed as electrodes for supercapacitor systems, their electrochemical response to extreme thermal environments is rarely discussed. In this work, PPy was rationally constructed on the surface of carbon cloth (CC) as electrodes and a type of high-performance flexible symmetric supercapacitor was assembled with a PVA-H3PO4gel electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors was systematically investigated at various surrounding temperatures from 0 °C to 60 °C using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The results demonstrated that the areal specific capacitance of the CC/PPy supercapacitor at 0.5 mA cm−2increased from 52.91 mF cm−2to 75.08 mF cm−2and the internal resistance fell by 71.4% when the operating temperature rose from 0 °C to 60 °C. Moreover, cycling stability dropped and the self-discharge behavior accelerated in the supercapacitors with the gradual increase in the external temperature. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the temperature-dependent pseudocapacitive performance of PPy-based flexible supercapacitors, which gives a valuable reference for energy storage system applications.",New Journal of Chemistry
Facile synthesis of vacancy-induced 2H-MoS2nanosheets and defect investigation for supercapacitor application,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.In this paper, a 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet is preparedviaa one-step hydrothermal method as electrode material for supercapacitors. Meanwhile, a series of MoS2−xnanostructures with sulfur vacancies have been successfully obtained in an Ar/H2mixed atmosphere at different annealing temperatures. The prepared materials were characterized by XRD, HR-TEM, Raman and XPS to identify their morphology and crystal properties. MoS2−xassembled by interconnected nanosheets (MoS2−x-700) provides a maximum specific capacitance of 143.12 F g−1at a current density of 1.0 A g−1with 87.1% of initial capacitance reserved after 5000 cycles. The outstanding performance of the annealed MoS2−xnanosheets in sodium storage is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of the unique interconnected structure and the abundant active vacancy generated by the sulfur vacancies. Atomic models of sulfur vacancy defects on the basal plane, Mo-edge and S-edge were established and the electronic properties of MoS2−xwere further evaluated assisted by first principles theory. DFT calculation results show that sulfur vacancy defects can provide additional empty states near the Fermi level and induce unpaired electrons, thus increasing the carrier density and improving electrical conductivity.

Insights into the Rich Polymorphism of the Na+Ion Conductor Na3PS4from the Perspective of Variable-Temperature Diffraction and Spectroscopy,"© Solid electrolytes are crucial for next-generation solid-state batteries, and Na3PS4 is one of the most promising Na+ conductors for such applications, despite outstanding questions regarding its structural polymorphs. In this contribution, we present a detailed investigation of the evolution in structure and dynamics of Na3PS4 over a wide temperature range 30 < T < 600 °C through combined experimental-computational analysis. Although Bragg diffraction experiments indicate a second-order phase transition from the tetragonal ground state (α, P4¯ 21c) to the cubic polymorph (β, I4¯ 3m) above ∼250 °C, pair distribution function analysis in real space and Raman spectroscopy indicate remnants of a tetragonal character in the range 250 < T < 500 °C, which we attribute to dynamic local tetragonal distortions. The first-order phase transition to the mesophasic high-temperature polymorph (γ, Fddd) is associated with a sharp volume increase and the onset of liquid-like dynamics for sodium-cations (translational) and thiophosphate-polyanions (rotational) evident by inelastic neutron and Raman spectroscopies, as well as pair-distribution function and molecular dynamics analyses. These results shed light on the rich polymorphism of Na3PS4 and are relevant for a range host of high-performance materials deriving from the Na3PS4 structural archetype.",Chemistry of Materials
A Polymorphic FeS2Cathode Enabled by Copper Current Collector Induced Displacement Redox Mechanism,"© In this contribution, we fabricated a composite consisting of two polymorphs of FeS2, pyrite (P-FeS2) and marcasite (M-FeS2), for high-performance Li-FeS2 battery. A series of electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic characterizations indicate that the introduction of metastable M-FeS2 into P-FeS2 enables the four-electron reduction between FeS2 and lithium to generate Fe and Li2S, providing a high specific capacity of 894 mAh/g with specific energy over 1300 Wh/kg. Moreover, it is verified that the electrochemical irreversibility of this composite toward lithium storage is mainly rooted in the shuttle effect, caused by the elemental sulfur which is inevitably produced during the oxidation process of Li2S and Fe. To tackle this issue, copper (Cu) current collector is adopted to chemically immobilize the soluble lithium polysulfides and fundamentally alter the reaction pathway. It is shown that compared with Fe, Li2S prefers to react with Cu current collector to generate Cu2S through the thermodynamically facile displacement reaction mechanism benefiting from the similar lattice framework between Cu2S and Li2S. Such displacement reaction without lattice reconstruction renders the composite superior rate capability (∼730 mAh/g@2 A/g) and long lifespan (89.7% capacity retention after 3200 cycles). Present work allows for the fabrication of high-performance electrodes based on metal chalcogenides.",ACS Nano
"A high-voltage, low-temperature molten sodium battery enabled by metal halide catholyte chemistry","© 2021 National Technology and Engineering Solutions of SandiaDespite its promise as a safe, reliable system for grid-scale electrical energy storage, traditional molten sodium (Na) battery deployment remains limited by cost-inflating high-temperature operation. Here, we describe a high-performance sodium iodide-gallium chloride (NaI-GaCl3) molten salt catholyte that enables a dramatic reduction in molten Na battery operating temperature from near 300°C to 110°C. We demonstrate stable, high-performance electrochemical cycling in a high-voltage (3.65 V) Na-NaI battery for >8 months at 110°C. Supporting this demonstration, characterization of the catholyte physical and electrochemical properties identifies critical composition, voltage, and state of charge boundaries associated with this enabling inorganic molten salt electrolyte. Symmetric and full cell testing show that the catholyte salt can support practical current densities in a low-temperature system. Collectively, these studies describe the critical catholyte properties that may lead to the realization of a new class of low-temperature molten Na batteries.",Cell Reports Physical Science
Nanocomposite synthesis strategies based on the transformation of well-tailored metal-organic frameworks,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Increasing the complexity of nanomaterials in terms of their structure and chemical composition has attracted significant attention, because it can yield unique scientific outcomes and considerable improvements for practical applications. Various approaches are being developed for the synthesis of nanostructured composites. Coordination polymers (CPs) emerged as new precursors in solid-state reactions for nanomaterials nearly two decades ago; the repetitively arranged inorganic and organic units can facilitate the production of nanoscale particles and porous carbon upon thermal decomposition. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a subgroup of CPs featuring crystalline and porous structures, have subsequently become primary objects of interest in this field, as can be seen by the rapidly increasing number of reports on this topic. However, unique composite materials with increasingly complex nanostructures, which cannot be achievedviaconventional methods, have been rarely realised, even though conventional MOF research has enabled the delicate control of structures at the molecular level and extensive applications as templates. In this regard, a comprehensive review of the fabrication strategies of MOF-based precursors and the thermal transformation into functional nanomaterials is provided herein, with a particular emphasis on the recent developments in nanocomposite research. We briefly introduce the roles and capabilities of MOFs in the synthesis of nanomaterials and subsequently discuss diverse synthetic routes for obtaining morphologically or compositionally advanced composite nanomaterials, based on our understanding of the MOF conversion mechanism.",Chemical Communications
Recent advances in cathode prelithiation additives and their use in lithium–ion batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The growing interest in electric vehicles and energy storage systems has increased the demand for lithium–ion battery technologies capable of providing high capacity and high energy density. As is known, irreversible loss of lithium in the initial cycle decreases significantly the energy density of lithium–ion batteries. Anode prelithiation is a common method to overcome the problem, although it brings the problems of high chemical reactivity and instability under battery processing and ambient conditions. In comparison to anode prelithiation with high difficulty, cathode prelithiation is much simpler. To compensate the initial lithium loss, many studies have aimed at finding suitable cathode additives, to improves the electrochemical performance of existing lithium–ion batteries. This article introduces the mechanism and development for prelithiation of lithium–ion battery, as well as requirements of cathode prelithiation additives, and summarizes the latest progress of research on cathode prelithiation additives. The challenges in the effective cathode prelithiation additives and the development direction of prelithiation technology are also provided.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
Mechanism investigation of iron selenide as polysulfide mediator for long-life lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The notorious issues of polysulfide shuttling behaviour and sluggish redox kinetics seriously hamper the practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. In this work, catalytic FeSe2 nanoparticles encapsulated with carbon nanoboxes (FeSe2@C NBs) that derived from the selenide reaction of yolk-shelled Fe3O4@C are proposed as a multifunctional sulfur host to restrain the polysulfide shuttle effect and accelerate the polysulfide redox conversion. The experimental results display that the S/FeSe2@C cathode exhibits better sulfur utilization, higher rate performance, and longer cycle life compared to S/Fe3O4@C cathode. Even after 700 cycles at 1C, an ultralow capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle of S/FeSe2@C cathode can still be maintained. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that FeSe2@C NBs possess stronger chemical affinity to polysulfides and lower energy gap between bonding and antibonding orbitals, which could promote the interfacial charge transfer kinetics, thus enabling better Li-S battery performance.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Beneficial properties of solvents and ions for lithium ion and post-lithium ion batteries: Implications from charge transfer models,"© 2021We study the solvation properties of standard lithium salts in various aprotic apolar solvents using conceptual density functional theory. The electronegativity and the chemical hardness of the species are introduced as reliable criteria for identifying suitable solvent-ion combinations. All salt solvation energies reveal positive values as a consequence of the ion association reaction which implies a tendecy for increased ion pair formation. Our findings reveal that frequently used solvents like propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, γ-butyrolactone and dimethoxyethane mainly favor the solvation of the lithium ion due to their nucleophilic and thus Lewis-basic properties. The solvation of standard anions like BF4−, PF6− and BOB− is of minor importance in terms of their contribution to the total solvation energy. Based on the values for the electronegativity and the chemical hardness, we show that the increased tendency towards ion pair formation can be avoided by using more acidic and softer anions in combination with more basic and softer solvents. A variation of the cation does not significantly lower the amount of ion pairs. Our results are in qualitative agreement with recent empirical assumptions and shed more light on the underlying interaction patterns.",Electrochimica Acta
Computational investigation of 2D 3d/4d hexagonal transition metal borides for metal-ion batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdTwo-dimensional (2D) transition metal borides (MBs) with rich diversity and intrinsic high conductivity attract increasingly focus in energy storage fields. Herein, seven structures (Sc2B2, Ti2B2, V2B2, Cr2B2, Zr2B2, Nb2B2, Mo2B2) were screened from one interesting class of 2D hexagonal 3d/4d M2B2 monolayers to be promising anode materials for Li-/Mg-/Al-ion battery using first principles calculations. Phonon dispersions, energy calculations, configuration analyses, electronic structure analyses and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm their high dynamic stability, strong adsorption capability and low volume change (< 7%) for Li/Mg/Al storage, and good thermostability with two layers of charge carriers. Furthermore, the high capacities (252–480/504–960/753–1442 mAh/g), low voltages (0.12–0.39/0.16–0.62/0.41–0.78 V), and ultra-low migration energy barriers (2.7–38.2/15.0–83.5/44.1–248.7 meV) in Li-/Mg-/Al-ion battery are proved. The performance of M2B2 monolayers in different ion batteries shows clear relationships with both the intrinsic nature of M and the electronegativity of charge carrier. For M2B2 monolayers in same period, the one with heavier M has higher dynamical stability, stronger bonding to charge carriers, and lower reaction voltage. In addition, a specific M2B2 monolayer shows stronger adsorption and slower conduction for the charge carrier with higher electronegativity. This work provides theoretical guidance for developing new MBs anode materials for ion batteries.",Electrochimica Acta
Vanadium Nitride Quantum Dots/Holey Graphene Matrix Boosting Adsorption and Conversion Reaction Kinetics for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been considered as potential next-generation energy storage systems due to their high specific energy of 2600 Wh kg-1 and 2800 Wh L-1. Nevertheless, the practical application of LSBs still faces several hazards, including the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides, low electrical conductivities of solid sulfur and lithium sulfides, and large volume expansion during charge/discharge cycles. To address this critical challenge, we innovatively proposed facile synthesis of nanostructured VN quantum dots (VNQD)/holey graphene matrix for stabilizing the sulfur cathode by simultaneously promoting the trapping, anchoring, and catalyzing efficiencies of both LiPSs and Li2S. Benefiting from abundant edge catalytic sites of VNQD, in-plane nanopores of graphene, and high electrical conductivity, the sulfur host not only provides high adsorption capability toward soluble polysulfides, strong binding ability for anchoring solid Li2S, and their rapid conversion kinetics but also contributes abundant sulfur storage sites and efficient transport pathways for lithium ions (Li+) and electrons. Consequently, the sulfur cathode exhibits high initial capacities of 1320 mAh g-1, high rate capability (850 mAh g-1 @ 4 mA cm-2), and high capacity retention of 99.95% per cycle after 500 cycles, providing a feasible solution for the practical utilization of shuttle-free Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Unveiling the physiochemical aspects of the matrix in improving sulfur-loading for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The sulfur cathode in Na/S batteries possesses a very high theoretical specific capacity of about 1675 mA h g-1 and specific energy of 1230 W h kg-1 (which is over five times that of the LiCoO2 cathode in Li-ion batteries), besides high abundance and cost-effectiveness of the electrode materials. The sulfur cathode in Na/S batteries undergoes various electrochemical processes, where a series of soluble sodium polysulfides are formed during the discharge reaction, which adversely affects the operation of the cell. Furthermore, the viable application of RT-Na/S batteries is severely challenged by various obstacles, including their short-life and low-sulfur utilization, which become more serious when sulfur loading is increased to the practically acceptable level of over 5 mg cm-2. Thus, there have been innovative efforts in recent years to manipulate the physiochemistry of the matrix to overcome these barriers toward the practical application of RT-Na/S batteries with an improved sulfur loading close to practical limits. The rational design of the matrix (i.e., physicochemical aspects) with a high-sulfur utilization and long lifespan are two crucial challenges that Na/S batteries are experiencing currently and require immediate attention to be addressed. This review highlights the recent progress on tuning the physiochemistry of the matrix through chemical and physical means to realize an improved sulfur-loading. Particularly, basic insight into the chemical binding, strategies for mesoscale assembly, unique architectures, and configurational innovation in the cathode are the specific focus. Finally, novel strategies to improve sulfur-loading are proposed to guide the future development of high-sulfur loading RT-Na/S batteries.",Materials Advances

The KMF(244)/rGO anode, with the synergistic effect of Ni, Co, and Mn redox species and K/F vacancy defects, presents remarkable specific capacity, rate and cycle performance, showing pseudocapacitive-dominated conversion/intercalation dual mechanisms. Interestingly, the KMF(244)/rGO//AC/NVPOF SICBs exhibit superior performance to KMF(244)/rGO//AC SICs and KMF(244)/rGO//NVPOF SIBs, which largely benefits from the synergistic energy storage superiority of SICs and SIBs showing pseudocapacitive, capacitive, and faradaic behavior in electrochemical processes. To sum up, our study presents a novel concept of sodium-ion supercabatteries realized by using the vacancy defective Ni-Co-Mn ternary perovskite fluoride anode with pseudocapacitive-dominated conversion/intercalation dual mechanisms and an AC/NVPOF capacitor/battery hybrid cathode, providing new insight into developing advanced energy storage devices and in-depth understanding of the charge storage mechanisms.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

A novel one-step reaction sodium-sulfur battery with high areal sulfur loading on hierarchical porous carbon fiber,"© 2020 The Authors. Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdRoom temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries are gaining extensive attention as attractive alternatives for large-scale energy storage, due to low cost and high abundancy of sodium and sulfur in nature. However, the dilemmas regarding soluble polysulfides (Na2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) and the inferior reaction kinetics limit their practical application. To address these issues, we report the activated porous carbon fibers (APCF) with small sulfur molecules (S2–4) confined in ultramicropores, to achieve a reversible single-step reaction in RT Na-S batteries. The mechanism is investigated by the in situ UV/vis spectroscopy, which demonstrates Na2S is the only product during the whole discharge process. Moreover, the hierarchical carbon structure can enhance areal sulfur loading without sacrificing the capacity due to thorough contact between electrolyte and sulfur electrode. As a consequence, the APCF electrode with 38 wt% sulfur (APCF-38S) delivers a high initial reversible specific capacity of 1412 mAh g−1 and 10.6 mAh cm−2 (avg. areal sulfur loading: 7.5 mg cm−2) at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g−1), revealing high degree of sulfur utilization. This study provides a new strategy for the development of high areal capacity RT Na-S batteries.",Carbon Energy

"Interplay between Conductivity, Matrix Relaxations and Composition of Ca-Polyoxyethylene Polymer Electrolytes","© 2021 The Authors. ChemElectroChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbHIn this report, the conductivity mechanism of Ca2+-ion in polyoxyethylene (POE) solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) for calcium secondary batteries is investigated by broadband electrical spectroscopy studies. SPEs are obtained by dissolving into the POE hosting matrix three different calcium salts: CaTf2, Ca(TFSI)2 and CaI2. The investigation of the electric response of the synthetized SPEs reveals the presence in materials of two polarization phenomena and two dielectric relaxation events. It is demonstrated that the nature of the anion (i. e., steric hindrance, charge density and ability to act as coordination ligand) and the density of “dynamic crosslinks” of SPEs is fundamental in the establishment of ion-ion/ion-polymer interactions. The long-range charge migration processes occurring along the two revealed percolation pathways of the electrolytes are generally coupled with the polymer host dynamics and depend on the temperature and the anion nature. This study offers the needed tools for understanding Ca2+ conduction in POE-based electrolytes.",ChemElectroChem

"Generating Short-Chain Sulfur Suitable for Efficient Sodium–Sulfur Batteries via Atomic Copper Sites on a N,O-Codoped Carbon Composite","© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSodium–sulfur batteries have attracted attention due to their high energy capacities and low costs, but the dissolution of sodium polysulfides still severely affects their cycle life, limiting their real-world applications. Herein, a stable sulfur host is reported, based on a N,O-codoped carbon composite derived from a bimetallic Cu–Zn metal-organic framework, which ensures high sulfur loading (67 wt%). Most importantly, this composite also includes single-atom copper catalysts, with a high Cu loading of 8.03 wt%. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis show that single atoms of Cu are coordinated with two N and two O atoms within the produced composite material. Those copper sites can weaken S-S bonds in the S8 ring structure, and thus are able to catalyze the formation of short-chain sulfur molecules in even larger-size pores. In addition, Cu atoms facilitate the conversion between the short-chain sulfur and Na2S. As a result, when the produced sulfur-loaded carbon framework containing the atomic Cu catalyst is used as a cathode for sodium–sulfur batteries, it exhibits superior capacity of 776 mAh g–1 with a high sulfur utilization (1158 mAh gs–1 normalized with sulfur content) after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g–1, and an excellent rate performance of 483 mAh g–1 (720 mAh gs–1) at 5 A g–1.",Advanced Energy Materials
Grain size effects on activation energy and conductivity: Na-β″-alumina ceramics and ion conductors with highly resistive grain boundary phases,"© 2021 The Author(s)As for many ion conductors, the electrical conductivity of polycrystalline Na-β″-alumina reported in literature varies by over two decades at a given temperature. This is often ascribed to a combination of variable effects related to grain size, composition, phase content, porosity and impurities, but the dominating factors are rarely identified. Based on an extensive set of Li2O-stabilized Na-β”-alumina ceramics sintered at different conditions, we evaluate a sample series with constant composition and phase content but variable conductivity. The total conductivity of the polycrystalline samples features pronounced non-Arrhenius temperature dependence. To explain this effect, we present a simple microstructural model describing the influence of grain size effects in Arrhenius-type ion conductors with highly resistive grain boundaries as a second phase. We show that this model further predicts a linear relationship between conductivity and effective activation energy at a given temperature, which we also observe experimentally. Based on this, we are able to identify to which extent conductivity variations in a given data set may be explained by grain size effects only. As the same microstructural model relates fundamental transport properties of the corresponding grain and grain boundary phases with the experimentally observed linear relationship, we further discuss how these parameters can be extracted, e.g. by taking into account experimentally determined grain size data. Comparison with literature data indicates for which Na-β″-alumina samples additional effects such as changes in composition and percolation of coarse grains are relevant for the transport properties. Our findings on the relation between effective conductivity and corresponding activation energy are applicable to Arrhenius-type ion conductors with highly resistive grain boundary phases in general.",Acta Materialia

Enhanced anchoring and catalytic conversion of polysulfides by iron phthalocyanine for graphene-based Li–S batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Rechargeable lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are seriously limited by low sulfur utilization and sluggish electrochemical reaction activity of polysulfide intermediates exacerbated by the detrimental shuttle effect. Herein, a strong mitigation toward lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) adsorption/catalysis is achieved by introducing iron phthalocyanine (FePc) as an effective additive for high-performance graphene-based Li–S batteries. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) acts as conductive infrastructure to ensure adequate electron transport and smooth electrolyte accessibility, while the additional conjugate molecule functions as active sites to accelerate the reactions kinetic, enhance the conversion process, and thus effectively inhibit the shuttling of LiPSs. By coupling FePc with rGO through π–π stacking interaction, the fabricated electrode with 10 wt.% of FePc exhibits a high initial discharge capacity (1307 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C) and a superior cyclic stability (a low capacity fading rate of 0.049% per cycle over 500 cycles at 0.5 C). The proposed hybridization strategy will offer new ways for achieving high-stable and long-lifetime Li–S batteries.",Ionics
Fluoride-Rich Solid-Electrolyte-Interface Enabling Stable Sodium Metal Batteries in High-Safe Electrolytes,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSodium metal batteries (SMBs) are promising for large scale energy storage due to the remarkable capacity of sodium metal anode (SMA) and the natural abundance of Na-containing resources. However, multiple challenges exist with regards to the usage of SMBs, including dendritic Na growth, poor cyclability of SMA, and severe safety hazards stemming from the employment of the highly flammable liquid electrolytes. Herein, by introducing two functional fluorinated solvents, 1,1,2,2-tetra-fluoroethyl 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (HFE) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) into trimethyl phosphate (TMP)-based electrolyte, a SMA-compatible flame-retardant electrolyte is enabled, in which Na/Na symmetrical cells can cycle for 800 h at 1.0 mA cm−2 or 3.0 mAh cm−2. Specifically, the non-solvating HFE plays a critical role in increasing the local electrolyte concentration and reducing the unfavorable decomposition of TMP molecules. By introducing FEC as the co-solvent simultaneously, its preferential defluorination induces a fluoride-rich solid-electrolyte interphase that prevents Na metal surface against the continuous parasitic reactions. More importantly, the designed electrolyte is endowed with an intrinsic non-flammability, which manifests a prerequisite for the real-life application of SMBs.",Advanced Functional Materials
Ultrafast charge in Zn-based batteries through high-potential deposition,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdRechargeable aqueous Zn-based batteries are highly desirable for future applications in large-scale energy storage since they are inexpensive and safe in comparison with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Additionally, the high energy density of Zn batteries, nearly comparable to that of LIBs, stands out in all types of aqueous batteries. Fast charge, extremely important in practical application, is another typical characteristic in aqueous batteries compared to LIBs with organic electrolyte, but little attention has been paid to it thus far. Herein, ultrafast charge of the cathodes in Zn batteries are realized through the rapid conversion of low-valence transition-metal ions to their high-valence solid oxides using a simple high-potential deposition strategy. In particular, the Mn-based cathode exhibits a charge time that is only around 1/40 of that by traditional constant-current charge method, while high capacity is acquired simultaneously due to the multivalent conversion.",Materials Today Physics

Covalently Interlinked Graphene Sheets with Sulfur-Chains Enable Superior Lithium–Sulfur Battery Cathodes at Full-Mass Level,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSulfur represents a low‑cost, sustainable, and high theoretical capacity cathode material for lithium–sulfur batteries, which can meet the growing demand in portable power sources, such as in electric vehicles and mobile information technologies. However, the shuttling effect of the formed lithium polysulfides, as well as their low conductivity, compromise the electrochemical performance of lithium–sulfur cells. To tackle this challenge, a so far unexplored cathode, composed of sulfur covalently bonded directly on graphene is developed. This is achieved by leveraging the nucleophilicity of polysulfide chains, which react readily with the electrophilic centers in fluorographene, as experimental and theoretical data unveil. The reaction leads to the formation of carbon–sulfur covalent bonds and a particularly high sulfur content of 80 mass%. Owing to these features, the developed cathode exhibits excellent performance with only 5 mass% of conductive carbon additive, delivering very high full‑cathode‑mass capacities and rate capability, combined with superior cycling stability. In combination with a fluorinated ether as electrolyte additive, the capacity persists at ≈700 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, and at ≈644 mAh g−1 after 250 cycles at 0.2 C, keeping ≈470 mAh g−1 even after 500 cycles.",Advanced Functional Materials
"Trust is good, control is better: A review on monitoring and characterization techniques for flow battery electrolytes","© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Flow batteries (FBs) currently are one of the most promising large-scale energy storage technologies for energy grids with a large share of renewable electricity generation. Among the main technological challenges for the economic operation of a large-scale battery technology is its calendar lifetime, which ideally has to cover a few decades without significant loss of performance. This requirement can only be met if the key parameters representing the performance losses of the system are continuously monitored and optimized during the operation. Nearly all performance parameters of a FB are related to the two electrolytes as the electrochemical storage media and we therefore focus on them in this review. We first survey the literature on the available characterization methods for the key FB electrolyte parameters. Based on these, we comprehensively review the currently available approaches for assessing the most important electrolyte state variables: the state-of-charge (SOC) and the state-of-health (SOH). We furthermore discuss how monitoring and operation strategies are commonly implemented as online tools to optimize the electrolyte performance and recover lost battery capacity as well as how their automation is realized via battery management systems (BMSs). Our key findings on the current state of this research field are finally highlighted and the potential for further progress is identified.",Materials Horizons
Development of environment friendly water-based self-rechargeable battery,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThere is a growing demand for the development of sustainable electrical energy generation devices with a high energy-to-price ratio. On the other hand, industrial waste, such as fly ash is a hazard to environmental pollution. However, here for the first time, water-based self-rechargeable batteries have been fabricated by using bio-waste (golden shower tree bark ash (TBA)), a rural pollutant (cow dung ash), and industrial pollutant (coal fly ash). The TBA-based battery, out of all three batteries, shows the highest open-circuit voltage of ∼1.48 V and a specific capacity of 183 mAhg−1. Further, the TBA based cell has retained ∼97% columbic efficiency even after 2000 cycles. It has been found that pH of TBA ash is the highest, i.e. ∼12 in presences of tap water and it is found that the TBA ash is composed of a large number of metal oxides. The materials present in the ash powder have generated oxides and hydroxides ions which have, in turn, caused the generation of the potential difference between the two electrodes. The fabricated devices are portable and can power up a large number of electronic gadgets, including light-emitting diodes (LEDs). It is envisioned that this work may open the door to the development of sustainable, environment-friendly, and low-cost bio-waste ash-based self-rechargeable energy devices in future.",Renewable Energy
Suppressed shuttling effect of polysulfides using three-dimensional nickel hydroxide polyhedrons for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021In this work, controlled-size hollow polyhedron assembled by crumpled nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) nanosheets from silicon dioxide (SiO2)-covered zeolitic imidazole framework-67 (ZIF-67@SiO2) is prepared via a template-sacrificed method. It is found that SiO2 plays an essential role in keeping intact polyhedrons and suppressing particle growth. Benefiting from structural and compositional advantages, the Ni(OH)2@S electrode exhibits high specific capacity, excellent rate performance, and stable cycle life at 1C with a small capacity decay of 0.067% per cycle.

Colorful conducting polymers for vivid solar panels,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdPhotovoltaic (PV) panels with vivid colors provide an additional dimension for developing new applications such as aesthetically appealing solar buildings and mobile products. Thus, rendering PV panel colorful at low cost while keeping high power conversion efficiency (PCE) is of great interest to the community. Based on polymer/Si heterojunction test cells, here we report that color rendering can be made by modifying the optical refractive index of the PEDOT:PSS films. The key to achieving the desired refractive index of the PEDOT:PSS layer for a specific color is to select proper doping material. Guided by theoretical modeling analysis, we have developed 1 × 1 cm2 silicon heterojunction solar cells with colors across the entire visible spectrum while simultaneously achieving a competitive PCE of 13.2%. As a solution-based process is used to fabricate the Si heterojunction cells, the method reported here can be readily scaled up using mature industrial tools such as inkjet printers.",Nano Energy

Their high refractory properties have made them an ideal candidate coating technology and more recently their electronic similarity to the platinum group has expanded their use to energy and catalysis. Here, we demonstrate that the nanostructuring and stoichiometry control of the highest melting point material to this date (Ta-Hf-C) results in outstanding electrochemical stability.

Tunable Nitrogen-Doping of Sulfur Host Nanostructures for Stable and Shuttle-Free Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries have potential in stationary applications, but challenges such as loss of active sulfur and low electrical conductivity must be solved. Nitrogen-doped nanocarbon host cathodes have been employed in metal-sulfur batteries: polar interactions mitigate the loss of sulfur, while the conductive nanostructure addresses the low conductivity. Nevertheless, these two properties run contrary to each other as greater nitrogen-doping of nanocarbon hosts is associated with lower conductivity. Herein, we investigate the polarity-conductivity dilemma to determine which of these properties have the stronger influence on cycling performance. Lower carbonization temperatures produce more pyridinic nitrogen and pyrrolic nitrogen, which from density functional theory calculations preferentially bind discharge products (Na2S and short-chain polysulfides). Despite its lower conductivity, the highly doped composite showed better Coulombic efficiency and stability, retaining a high capacity of 980 mAh g(S)-1 after 800 cycles. Our findings represent a paradigm shift where nitrogen-doping should be prioritized in designing shuttle-free, long-life sodium-sulfur batteries.",Nano Letters

The metal-organic framework mediated synthesis of bell string-like hollow ZnS-C nanofibers to enhance sodium storage performance,"© 2021 the Partner Organisations.Zinc sulfide (ZnS), with a high theoretical capacity and low redox potential, is considered to be a promising anode material for use in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the dissolution of polysulfides and the structural collapse of ZnS will undoubtedly lead to inferior electrochemical properties. Herein, a bell string-like hollow ZnS-C nanofibers (ZnS@CNFs) film, which displays the unique structural integration of metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived hollow ZnS and three-dimensional (3D) N, S co-doped carbon nanofiber networks, is successfully fabricated via MOF-mediated electrospinning followed by solvothermal sulfuration and pyrolysis processes. The as-prepared ZnS@CNFs films, as free-standing anodes for SIBs, exhibit an excellent adsorption capacity for polysulfides and outstanding sodium storage performance owing to the existence of C-S bonds and conductive pathways. As a result, the ZnS@CNFs anodes show superior rate capabilities (258.3 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 with a high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 88.4%) and cycling stability (decay ratio of 0.029% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1 A g-1). Finally, ZnS@CNFs//Na3V2(PO4)3 full-cells achieve a high energy density of 156.9 W h kg-1.

All right reserved.Na-β""-Al2O3 was prepared with nano-η-Al2O3 powder by a double zeta process, MgO as stabilizer. The compactness, microstructure and mechanical properties of the samples were studied by Archimedes, SEM and three-point bending method, and the β""-Al2O3 phase content and ionic conductivity of the samples were studied by XRD and EIS. The results show that double zeta process is beneficial to improve the uniformity of sample structure. Nano-η-Al2O3 is easier to synthesize Na-β""-Al2O3 solid electrolyte than high purity α-Al2O3, the addition of appropriate MgO can increase the content of the β""-Al2O3 phase and the compactness of the samples, reduce the grain boundary resistance of the sample and improve the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. Excessive MgO doping results in the growth of pore size in the samples, which will increase the grain resistance and decrease the ionic conductivity. The ionic conductivity of the electrolyte material reaches 0.0396 S•cm-1 at 300℃ when the amount of MgO is 2% (mass fraction).",Cailiao Gongcheng/Journal of Materials Engineering
Ultrafine Sodium Sulfide Clusters Confined in Carbon Nano-polyhedrons as High-Efficiency Presodiation Reagents for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Sodium loss at the anode in the initial sodiation process significantly reduces the energy density of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Here, a high-capacity Na2S/C nanocomposite featuring ultrafine Na2S nanoclusters (<2 nm) confined in ZIF-8-derived microporous N-doped carbon is fabricated and employed as a cathode presodiation reagent to compensate for this sodium loss and increase the energy density of SIBs. The ultrafine size of Na2S enables fast reaction kinetics for sodium extraction and the carbon matrix provides good electronic conductivity. Also, the overall particle size of the Na2S/C nanocomposite (∼40 nm) is close to that of conductive additive. The above features enable it to replace a partial amount of conductive additive and compensate for the sodium loss at the anode concurrently. As a demonstration, the Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode with 5 wt % Na2S/C and 5 wt % carbon black was fabricated, and it displayed a 19 mAh g-1 higher initial charge specific capacity than that of the counterpart with 10% carbon black without the addition of Na2S/C, realizing an increased energy density from 178 to 263 Wh kg-1 in the full cell configuration pairing with a hard carbon anode. Moreover, a stable cycling performance up to 200 cycles with an average capacity loss of 0.024 mAh g-1 per cycle was achieved for the presodiated Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

The unique tremella-like structure is formed by the self-assembly of layered FeS/C, which would make the contact between the active material and the electrolyte sufficient, and maintain pronounced electrochemical performance. The studies show that the FeS/C synthesized is mainly dominated by the pseudocapacitive behavior in the electrochemical reaction processes, leading to fast the electrode reaction kinetics. The FeS/C anode also exhibits a large initial capacity of 619 mAh g−1 and remains 410.5 mAh g−1 with excellent rate performances.",Materials Letters
Bifunctional polyvinylpyrrolidone generates sulfur-rich copolymer and acts as “residence” of polysulfide for advanced lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Sulfur-rich copolymer is considered as a promising cathode in lithium-sulfur battery due to its superior chemical confinement for polysulfides on the molecular level, but the sulfur-rich copolymer with low cost and physiological inert is reported rarely. Here, a novel sulfur-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVPS) copolymer is synthesized by one-step thermal polymerization. The break and recombination of C[dbnd]O lead to the formation of PVPS, which is proved by various characterizations. Due to the strong chemical confinement of C–S bond, the excellent polysulfides adsorption ability of PVP with abundant polar bonds (such as C–O and C–N) and the improved charge transfer of PVPS, 20PVPS combining with PVP-modified separator as “residence” of polysulfides delivers the high reversible capacity of 1079 and 729 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 2 C and a slow capacity fading rate of 0.093% over 500 cycles at 1 C.

Single-atom catalysts for high-energy rechargeable batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Clean and sustainable electrochemical energy storage has attracted extensive attention.

A MoSe2/N-doped hollow carbon sphere host for rechargeable Na-Se batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Sodium-selenium (Na-Se) batteries are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries for energy storage systems owing to their high energy density and natural abundance of Na resources. However, their drawbacks of low Se loading, dissolution of intermediate sodium polyselenides in the electrolyte and volumetric expansion of Se impede their real applications. To address these issues, herein, we report a multifunctional Se host with MoSe2nanosheets coupled with nitrogen-doped porous carbon hollow spheres for the first time. The N-doped hollow carbon sphere structure could provide a large space for Se loading (Se content up to 72 wt%) and accommodate the volume expansion of Se species upon cycling. MoSe2was chosen as a polar coupling component for the carbon matrix, owing to its low conversion reaction voltage. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the MoSe2nanosheets coupled with hollow spheres could enhance the adsorption energy of the host to polyselenides chemically, which benefits the immobilization of polyselenides. Therefore, as a cathode for Na-Se batteries, the as-prepared composite exhibits excellent energy storage performance with long cycling life and superior rate performance. Our study of introducing transition metal selenides into Na-Se batteries may stimulate the designing of diverse Se-based cathodes.",Dalton Transactions

The main problems and solutions in practical application of anode materials for sodium ion batteries and the latest research progress,"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons LtdLithium-ion batteries(LIBs) have been widely used in people's daily lives.

Understanding and mitigation of NaTi2(PO4)3degradation in aqueous Na-ion batteries,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Aqueous Na-ion batteries are deemed to be among the most suitable candidates for future large-scale stationary energy storage systems. However, there are still a number of problems to be solved before their full potential can be utilized such as instability of the aqueous electrolyte/electrode interface towards electrolyte decomposition, chemical dissolution, and other side reactions. The mechanism of electrochemically induced degradation in NASICON-structured NaTi2(PO4)3 is studied in detail using various chemical and electrochemical techniques. The results unambiguously show that irreversible capacity fade, especially severe at low charging rates, is an electrochemically induced chemical dissolution of the active material. The oxygen reduction induced self-discharge reaction leading to a local pH increase is indicated as the main culprit for the material degradation and capacity loss during charge-discharge cycling. Although the degradation products form an insoluble Ti-rich interphasial layer similar to non-aqueous solid-electrolyte interphases, in this case it is shown to be insufficient for providing even kinetic stability of the electrochemical interface. Artificial protective layers applied using atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 directly on the electrode surface are shown to be a simple and scalable approach to significantly stabilize the electrodes towards oxygen attack and limit the rate of negative electrode degradation. The new understanding of irreversible degradation and its mitigation techniques presented in this work offer a pathway to viable and scalable strategies that enable and exploit the high-performance potential of this and many other aqueous battery materials.

Boosting electrochemical kinetics of S cathodes for room temperature Na/S batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Due to the low cost and high energy density, the room temperature (RT) Na/S battery system is deemed as one of the best potential energy-storage systems. However, various issues still severely hinder its practical applications, especially the shuttle effect caused by soluble sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) and the low conversion efficiency of S8 and Na2S2/Na2S in S cathodes. Recently, various strategies were adopted into RT-Na/S batteries to boost the electrochemical kinetics of S cathodes, which are capable of significantly accelerating (or altering) the redox process and mitigating the shuttle effect of S cathodes.

Furthermore, the future challenges and research directions for the S cathodes have also been prospected in detail to provide guideline for the development of RT-Na/S batteries.",Matter
Rechargeable all-solid-state tin ion battery in a low-temperature environment,"© 2021 The AuthorIn this study, a Sn–7Mg alloy foil anode, a magnesium silicate electrolyte, and a Sn–40Cu alloy film cathode were fabricated and incorporated into an all-solid-state battery; then, the influence of operating temperature on the charge–discharge cycle characteristics was investigated. An intermetallic compound (Cu6Sn5) formed through metallurgy and heat treatment aided in suppressing the volume expansion of the electrode material. The results revealed that, when operated at room temperature, the battery exhibited the optimal charge–discharge cycle performance. Although the battery exhibited decreased capacity at a low temperature (−15 ​°C), its cycling stability remained applicable. By contrast, at a high temperature (55 ​°C), the battery had only a few charge–discharge cycles due to the escape of the interlayer water molecules form the electrolyte structure. Thus, this all-solid-state Sn battery is environmentally friendly and non-toxic, exhibits suitable capacity and stability, and shows potential for low-temperature energy storage applications.",Results in Materials
"Preparation of β""-Al2O3 electrolytes by freeze-drying and SPS","© 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Na-ionic conductivity and mechanical strength are two important parameters for β""-Al2O3 ceramics used as electrolyte materials. In this study, the ice-templating and freeze-drying processes were used to prepare uniformly porous Al2O3 powder with a certain degree of crystallographic orientation. With the help of spark plasma sintering (SPS) process, solid samples were fabricated from the porous power at a low temperature (1100 °C). Finally, highly conductive and highly strong β""-Al2O3 electrolytes were prepared after the solid samples were subject to further treatment at a high temperature (1600 °C). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results indicate that integration of the initial SPS process and further high-temperature sintering treatment have turned the freeze-dried Al2O3 powder to β""-Al2O3 samples whose grain structure is similar to the “brick-bridge-mortar” structure. Regarding such β""-Al2O3 samples, the bending strength parallel to the pressure direction is up to 273 MPa; the degree of crystallographic orientation, 0.25, and the ionic conductivity perpendicular to the pressure direction, 0.239 S cm−1 at 350 °C. Therefore, it can be concluded that the combination of freeze-drying, SPS and an additional high-temperature sintering process has helped generate a structure that improves the ion mobility and bending strength of the β""-Al2O3 ceramic, and thereby improving its strength and ionic conductivity.",Ceramics International
Manipulating metal–sulfur interactions for achieving high-performance S cathodes for room temperature Li/Na–sulfur batteries,"© 2021 The Authors. Carbon Energy published by Wenzhou University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Rechargeable lithium/sodium–sulfur batteries working at room temperature (RT-Li/S, RT-Na/S) appear to be a promising energy storage system in terms of high theoretical energy density, low cost, and abundant resources in nature. They are, thus, considered as highly attractive candidates for future application in energy storage devices. Nevertheless, the solubility of sulfur species, sluggish kinetics of lithium/sodium sulfide compounds, and high reactivity of metallic anodes render these cells unstable. As a consequence, metal–sulfur batteries present low reversible capacity and quick capacity loss, which hinder their practical application. Investigations to address these issues regarding S cathodes are critical to the increase of their performance and our fundamental understanding of RT-Li/S and RT-Na/S battery systems. Metal–sulfur interactions, recently, have attracted considerable attention, and there have been new insights on pathways to high-performance RT-Li/Na sulfur batteries, due to the following factors: (1) deliberate construction of metal–sulfur interactions can enable a leap in capacity; (2) metal–sulfur interactions can confine S species, as well as sodium sulfide compounds, to stop shuttle effects; (3) traces of metal species can help to encapsulate a high loading mass of sulfur with high-cost efficiency; and (4) metal components make electrodes more conductive. In this review, we highlight the latest progress in sulfide immobilization via constructing metal bonding between various metals and S cathodes. Also, we summarize the storage mechanisms of Li/Na as well as the metal–sulfur interaction mechanisms. Furthermore, the current challenges and future remedies in terms of intact confinement and optimization of the electrochemical performance of RT-Li/Na sulfur systems are discussed in this review.",Carbon Energy
In Situ TEM Studies of Sodium Polysulfides Electrochemistry in High Temperature Na–S Nanobatteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHUnderstanding polysulfide electrochemistry in high temperature sodium–sulfur (HT–Na–S) batteries is crucial for their practical applications. Currently the discharge capacity of commercial HT–Na–S battery achieves only one third of its theoretical capacity due to polysulfides formation, understanding of which is limited due to technical difficulty in direct imaging polysulfides. Herein, in situ transmission electron microscopy implemented with a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) heating device is used to investigate the electrochemical reactions of HT–Na–S batteries. The formation and evolution of transient polysulfides during cycling are revealed in real-time. Upon discharge, sulfur transforms to long-chain polysulfides, short-chain polysulfides, and finally Na2S or its mixture with polysulfides, and the process is reversible during charge at high temperatures. Surprisingly, by introducing nanovoids into the sulfur cathode to buffer the large volume change thus preserving the integrity of the electronic/ionic pathways and reducing the diffusion distance of Na+ ions, the sulfur cathode is fully discharged to Na2S rather than the conventionally observed Na2S2 at 300 °C. Moreover, the electrochemical reaction is swift and highly reversible. The in situ studies provide not only new understanding to the polysulfide electrochemistry, but also critical strategies to boost the capacity and cyclability of HT–Na–S batteries for large-scale energy storage applications.",Small

Herein, yolk-shell-structured nanospheres, with goat pupil-like configuration of S-doped SnSe yolks and hollow carbon shells, are synthesized by salt-infiltration and a simple post-treatment procedure. Impressively, the co-infiltration of thiourea and selenium oxide enables the doping of sulfur into SnSe (SnSeS) and carbon shells, as well as the formation of a goat pupil-like yolk–shell architecture. High-reactivity thiourea-derived H2S gas forms nanocrystals inside the carbon nanospheres. The nanocrystals act as seeds for the crystal growth of SnSeS through Ostwald ripening. The unique yolk–shell structure and composition with a heterointerface provide not only structural stability but also fast electrode reaction kinetics during repeated cycling. The SnSeS@C electrode shows an excellent cycle life (186 mA h g−1 for 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g−1) and rate capability (112 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1).",Small Methods

And then, two composites (PTDT@C and PTDO@C) are made by coating the polymers on the surface of active carbon with an in situ method, which are used as the electrode materials of lithium-ion battery. The reversible capacities of PTDT@C and PTDO@C are 246.9 and 322.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 300 cycles running, respectively. By deducing the capability contribution of pure carbon, the theoretical capacities of the pure polymers are calculated to be 596 and 991 mAh g−1, respectively, for PTDT and PTDO, which correspond to the lithium storage number of 6.7 and 13.3, respectively, for the least repeating unit of the polymers. With the help of theoretical calculations, the underlying mechanisms for the different electrochemical performances of the polymers are discussed and revealed. The structure-activity relationship discussed in this work may provide the design principle for the construction of the D-A-type polymers used as high-capacity electrode materials for organic rechargeable batteries.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry

Designing Nanostructured Metal Chalcogenides as Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHRechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are regarded as promising candidates for beyond-lithium-ion batteries owing to their high energy density. Moreover, as Mg metal is earth-abundant and has low propensity for dendritic growth, RMBs have the advantages of being more affordable and safer than the currently used lithium-ion batteries. However, the commercial viability of RMBs has been negatively impacted by slow diffusion kinetics in most cathode materials due to the high charge density and strongly polarizing nature of the Mg2+ ion. Nanostructuring of potential cathode materials such as metal chalcogenides offers an effective means of addressing these challenges by providing larger surface area and shorter migration routes. In this article, a review of recent research on the design of metal chalcogenide nanostructures for RMBs’ cathode materials is provided. The different types and structures of metal chalcogenide cathodes are discussed, and the synthetic strategies through which nanostructuring of these materials can be achieved are described. An organized summary of their electrochemical performance is also presented, along with an analysis of the current challenges and future directions. Although particular focus is placed on RMBs, many of the nanostructuring concepts that are discussed here can be carried forward to other next-generation energy storage systems.",Small

Herein, a facile and scalable spray-drying strategy is presented to construct conductive polar Mo2C quantum dots-decorated carbon nanotube (CNT) networks (MCN) as an efficient absorbent and electrocatalyst for Li-S batteries. The results reveal that the MCN/S electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 1303.3 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, and ultrastable cycling stability with decay of 0.019% per cycle even at 1 C. Theoretical simulation uncovers that Mo2C exhibits much stronger binding energies for S8 and Li2Sn. The energy barrier for the conversion between Li2S4 and Li2S2 decreases from 1.02 to 0.72 eV when hybriding with Mo2C. Furthermore, in situ discharge/charge-dependent Raman spectroscopy shows that long-chain Li2S8 configuration is generated via S8 ring opening near the first plateaus at ≈2.36 V versus Li/Li+ and the S62− configuration in CNT/S electrode is maintained below the potential of ≈2.30 V versus Li/Li+, indicating that the shuttle of soluble LiPSs happens during the whole discharge process.

Ultrahigh Phosphorus Doping of Carbon for High-Rate Sodium Ion Batteries Anode,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHPhosphorus doped carbons are of particular interest as anode materials because of their large interlayer spacing and strong adsorption of Na+ ions. However, it remains challenging to achieve high phosphorus doping due to the limited choices of phosphorus sources and the difficulty in constructing oxygen-free synthesis system. Herein, a new synthesis strategy is proposed to prepare ultrahigh phosphorus-doped carbon (UPC) anodes for high performance sodium ion batteries (SIBs). By using two commonly available, miscible, evaporable liquids in PCl3 and C6H12, as phosphorus and carbon sources, an oxygen-free reaction system is successfully established by N2 bubbling to simultaneously realize carbonization and in situ P doping. The P content can reach 30 wt%, much higher than most reported P-doping carbon-based materials. Furthermore, the doped P is dominated by substitutional P-(C3) protrusions in the carbon lattice, which can significantly enlarge the interlayer spacing and enhance the adsorption energy of Na+. When serving as the SIBs anode, the UPC delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 510.4 mAh g−1 with a rational operating voltage of 0.54 V, and the best rate capability of 397.1 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1. This new strategy will effectively promote the practical application of hard carbon.",Advanced Energy Materials

High Performance Flexible Lithium-Ion Battery Electrodes: Ion Exchange Assisted Fabrication of Carbon Coated Nickel Oxide Nanosheet Arrays on Carbon Cloth,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHTransition metal oxides (TMOs)-based anode materials of high theoretical capacities have been intensively studied for lithium-ion storage. However, their poor high-rate capability and cycling stability remain to be effectively resolved. Herein, a novel ion exchange (IE)-assisted indirect carbon coating strategy is proposed to realize high performance freestanding TMO-based anodes for flexible lithium-ion batteries (FLIBs). This approach effectively avoids the possible side reaction of oxide reduction, enhances degrees of graphitization of the carbon coating, and preserves advantageous nanostructure of the starting template, leading to enhanced electrical conductivities, alleviated volume variation induced structural instability, fast lithium-ion diffusion pathways and enhanced electron transfer kinetics. As a proof of concept, IE-prepared carbon coated NiO nanosheet arrays with excellent structural and electrochemical stability are developed as freestanding anodes for LIBs and FLIBs, which exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances superior to most state-of-the-art NiO-based anodes reported in recent years. The product anode delivers a high areal capacity (3.08 mAh cm−2 at 0.25 mA cm−2), outstanding high-rate capability (1.78 mAh cm−2 at 8 mA cm−2) and excellent cycling stability (over 300 cycles).

Polyoxometalate Modified Separator for Performance Enhancement of Magnesium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbHThe magnesium–sulfur (Mg-S) battery has attracted considerable attention as a candidate of post-lithium battery systems owing to its high volumetric energy density, safety, and cost effectiveness. However, the known shuttle effect of the soluble polysulfides during charge and discharge leads to a rapid capacity fade and hinders the realization of sulfur-based battery technology. Along with the approaches for cathode design and electrolyte formulation, functionalization of separators can be employed to suppress the polysulfide shuttle. In this study, a glass fiber separator coated with decavanadate-based polyoxometalate (POM) clusters/carbon composite is fabricated by electrospinning technique and its impacts on battery performance and suppression of polysulfide shuttling are investigated. Mg–S batteries with such coated separators and non-corrosive Mg[B(hfip)4]2 electrolyte show significantly enhanced reversible capacity and cycling stability.

Preparation and electrochemical properties of ionic-liquid-modified Na3SbS4 membrane composite electrolytes,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.Sulfide-based Na-ion solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity are one of the most promising solid electrolytes for solid-state Na batteries. However, its poor chemical/electrochemical stability against Na metal leads to deterioration of interface. In addition, it is important to explore how to prepare sulfide-based composite membranes via solution method. Herein, Na3SbS4 is deposited on glassfiber framework via aqueous solution and further incorporated with trace of ionic liquid (IL). The Na3SbS4 composite pellets are well shaped avoiding the pressing process. The IL not only improves the Na3SbS4-Na interfacial stability, but also fills the pores between the framework and Na3SbS4 and thereby suppressing the dendrite formation. The Na plating/stripping tests on symmetric cells show polarization voltages lower than 0.1 V and stable cycling for more than 400 cycles under a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 at room temperature. The cycling performance of the FeS2 half-cells with the optimized electrolyte tested at 60 °C is superior to that with organic liquid electrolyte.

Insight into the amorphous nickel-iron (oxy)hydroxide catalyst for efficient oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.The specific roles of Ni and Fe in nickel-iron (oxy)hydroxide catalyst (NiFeOx(OH)y) are extensively discussed during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, there still remains controversy about whether Ni or Fe species as the dominate active site. In this work, we reported the NiFeOx(OH)y catalysts with varied atomic ratio of nickel and iron for OER to explore the dominate active site during OER processes. From the electrochemical performances, the similar Tafel slopes of catalysts with Fe species can achieve at a level of 40 mV dec−1, outperforming the Tafel slopes of catalysts without Fe species. Thus, it can be concluded that the present Fe site can serve as the dominant active site in NiFeOx(OH)y for OER. Meanwhile, the Ni species is proved as the OH– adsorption site, which is beneficial to the Fe site to deliver a better OER performance. As a result, the catalyst with an optimal Ni/Fe interface (atomic ratio of 1: 1.18) displays outstanding OER performances. It only requires a low overpotential of 250 mV to deliver current density of 10 mA cm−2 and exhibits a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec−1. This catalyst also shows remarkable stability with negligible potential decay after 50 h at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. This work offers a new sight into the specific roles of Ni and Fe in NiFeOx(OH)y for OER.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Elucidating influence of the existence formation of anchored cobalt phthalocyanine on electrocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdHeterogeneous molecular catalysts with inexpensive transition-metal centers have attracted much attention, due to their excellent electrocatalytic performance on electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Among them, metal phthalocyanine (MePc) has aroused great interest. However, the complex existence formation (crystals or evenly dispersion) in the hybrid catalyst, e.g. cobalt (II) phthalocyanine (CoPc), determining the final electrocatalytic CO2RR performance still remains debate. To further elucidate the influence of the existence formation of CoPc on electrocatalytic performance of CO2-to-CO conversion, we synthesized ultra-thin nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres (N-doped HCS) with a high surface area of 653.3 m2 g−1 as the support to anchor a series of different existence formation of CoPc. The existence formation of CoPc in the hybrid catalyst is closely related with the content of Co atom, the latter of which is the key factor of the CO2RR performance. We summarized the nonlinear relationship between the partial CO current density (jCO) and the content of Co atom at −0.82 V vs. RHE, and the equation of Faraday efficiency of CO (FECO) vs. the content of Co atom at −0.82 V vs. RHE, which proves the fact that the coexistence of crystals and evenly dispersed CoPc or evenly dispersed and low loading of CoPc both could reach the satisfying results (jCO > ~14 mA cm−2, FECO > ~ 91%, at −0.82 V vs. RHE) under the content of Co atom from 1.26 wt% to 0.14 wt%. The optimal catalyst (Co, 0.49 wt%) achieved a near-unity Faradaic efficiency of 96%, which is close to 4 times that of the unsupported CoPc (FECO =24.54%), and an outstanding current density of 20.47 mA cm−2 towards CO, which is c.a. 60 times higher than that of the unsupported CoPc (0.34 mA cm−2) at −0.82 V vs. RHE. This work could potentially inspire the rational design of heterogeneous molecular catalysts and promote its application in the energy conversion and storage field.",Nano Energy
Controllable deposition of FeV2S4 in carbon fibers for sodium-ion storage with high capacity and long lifetime 碳纤维中可控修饰FeV2S4及其高容量长寿命储钠研究,"© 2021, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Metal sulfides with high specific capacities have drawn considerable attention in the field of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). As a typical metal sulfide, FeV2S4 always suffers rapid decay of capacities because of its low stability arising from large volume change. FeV2S4 nanoparticles with controllable sizes and distribution are encapsulated in carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with the help of graphene oxide (GO) to fabricate FeV2S4@GO@CNF. As a result, FeV2S4@GO@CNF anodes show enhanced electrochemical performances for Na+ storage when compared with FeV2S4@CNF with more particles on the surface. Typically, the capacity of FeV2S4@GO@CNF can be maintained at 411 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles (0.1 A g−1) and 227 mA h g−1 over 500 cycles (1 A g−1) in SIBs. Moreover, they can deliver a capacity of 170.2 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles (0.1 A g−1) at 0°C. In addition, full cells based on FeV2S4@ GO@CNF anodes and Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathodes achieve a remarkable capacity of 164 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. The high specific capacities and stability of FeV2S4@GO@CNF can be attributed to GO, which controls the size of FeV2S4 nanoparticles and their distribution in CNFs, resulting in the enhanced stability of FeV2S4@GO@CNF. This study may provide a new strategy for the synthesis of nanoparticle-CNF composites in catalysts and batteries.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Science China Materials

Yolk-shell porous carbon spheres@CoSe2 nanosheets as multilayer defenses system of polysulfide for advanced Li-S batteries,"© 2020Restraining the shuttle effect and improving the cycling durability of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are the basic premise to realize its large-scale application, while the adsorption and catalytic capacities of the host to polysulfide lithium (Li2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) is the key to affect those performances. Therefore, in this work, yolk-shell porous carbon spheres loaded with CoSe2 nanosheets (THC-CoSe2) are synthesized as hosts for Li-S batteries. Due to the unique microstructure, as-constructed S@THC-CoSe2 cathode not only can relieve the volume expansion of active substance, but also offer a “multilayer defensive system” to prevent the outward diffusion of Li2Sn through physical and chemical interactions simultaneously. In addition, the outermost CoSe2 nanosheets with excellent electronic conductivity is able to catalyze the transformation of Li2Sn anchored on its surface, finally accelerating the elimination of soluble intermediates and weakening the shuttle phenomenon. Based on above advantages, the initial discharge capacity of the Li-S battery assembled by S@THC-CoSe2 cathode is as high as 1230.0 mAh g−1 at the current rate of 0.1C, and the capacity attenuation of each cycle is as low as 0.034% in 1000cycles at 1.0C.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Tuning Charge Distribution of FeN4via External N for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Atomically dispersed FeN4 catalysts have been considered as potential materials to replace Pt-based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but they often suffer from sluggish O2 activation kinetics due to the symmetrical charge distribution. Herein, we introduce external N, including pyrrolic-N (PN) and graphitic-N (GN), as an electron acceptor near FeN4 to regulate its charge distribution and improve its ORR activity. Theoretical calculations reveal that introduction of PN evokes much enhanced electron redistribution and local electrical field on the Fe site compared with those observed with GN introduction and the pristine one. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy validate the positive charge accumulation of Fe in the FeN4 site induced by introducing PN. Thus, the obtained FeN4-PN exhibits a great performance for ORR in 0.1 M KOH with a remarkable half-wave potential of 0.91 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, as well as a Tafel slope of 58 mV decade-1.

Freestanding interlayers for Li-S batteries: Design and synthesis of hierarchically porous N-doped C nanofibers comprising vanadium nitride quantum dots and MOF-derived hollow N-doped C nanocages,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The introduction of a functional interlayer between the cathode and anode in lithium-sulfur battery (LSB) technology results in significant improvements in electrochemical performance. Here, we developed hierarchically structured porous, conductive, and multifunctional N-doped carbon (N-C) nanofibers comprising homogeneously dispersed vanadium nitride quantum dots and hollow N-C nanocages as functional interlayers for advanced LSBs. The freestanding interlayer contains well-developed long-range channels and numerous interconnected hollow N-C nanocages derived from the metal-organic framework. Furthermore, the presence of a N-C framework and vanadium nitride quantum dots measuring several nanometers improves the redox reaction kinetics and provides numerous chemisorption sites for the effective trapping and reuse of lithium polysulfide. As a result, the assembled Li-S cell employing the unique nanostructured freestanding interlayer exhibits superior rate capability and stable cycling performance (decay rate of 0.02% per cycle at 0.5C) considering the high sulfur content (80 wt%) and loading (ca. 4 mg cm-2) in the sulfur electrodes. Even with an ultra-high sulfur loading of 11.0 mg cm-2, the Li-S cell delivered a stable areal capacity of 5.0 mA h cm-2 after 100 charge-discharge cycles at 0.05C. Thus, the uniquely nanostructured interlayer shows high potential for the development of advanced LSBs utilizing pure sulfur electrodes with realistic battery parameters.

Temperature Dependence of Lithium Anode Voiding in Argyrodite Solid-State Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Void formation at the Li/ceramic electrolyte interface of an all-solid-state battery on discharge results in high local current densities, dendrites on charge, and cell failure. Here, we show that such voiding is reduced at the Li/Li6PS5Cl interface at elevated temperatures, sufficient to increase the critical current before voiding and cell failure from <0.25 mA cm-2 at 25 °C to 0.25 mA cm-2 at 60 °C and 0.5 mA cm-2 at 80 °C under a relatively low stack-pressure of 1 MPa. Increasing the stack-pressure to 5 MPa and temperature to 80 °C permits stable cycling at 2.5 mA cm-2. It is also shown that the charge-transfer resistance at the Li/Li6PS5Cl interface depends on pressure and temperature, with relatively high pressures required to maintain low charge-transfer resistance at -20 °C. These results are consistent with the plastic deformation of Li metal dominating the performance of the Li anode, posing challenges for the implementation of solid-state cells with Li anodes.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Petal-shaped SnO2 free-standing electrodes with electrically conducting layers via a plasma-activated nitrogen doping process for high performance lithium-ion batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.SnO2 Free-standing anodes are regarded as a potential negative electrode for high energy lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, they suffer from poor rate capability and reversibility because of very low electric conductivity of SnO2. In this study, in order to endow electrical conductivity to the surface of SnO2 particles, a novel and facile method using a plasma are employed to dope nitrogen into the lattice of SnO2. The SnO2 free-standing anode was fabricated by carbonizing an electro-spun fiber sheet followed by depositing SnO2 particles on the surface of carbon nanofibers (CNF) comprising the sheet through a hydrothermal process. The best N-doped SnO2 anode obtained under an optimized condition exhibits a 23 times higher specific capacity of 767 mAh g−1 than that of a pristine SnO2 anode (<32 mAh g−1) at a high current density of 3.0 A g−1. Furthermore, in a long-term cycle test at 0.1 A g−1, this anode shows a high retention capability with a specific capacity of 909 mAh g−1 and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.3% after 100 cycles. Based on the extensive physical/electrochemical characterizations and performance tests, a mechanism is proposed explaining the roles of N-doped SnO2 layer in the electrochemical reactions. Overall, the plasma-treated SnO2 anode exhibits significantly improved capacity retention, rate capability and long-term cycle stability by forming an electrically conducting layer on the surfaces of SnO2 particles. Therefore, this plasma technique is confirmed to be a very facile and effective way to significantly improve the performance of SnO2 anode for LiBs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Effect of anion identity on ion association and dynamics of sodium ions in non-aqueous glyme based electrolytes - OTf vs TFSI,"© 2021 Author(s).Sodium-based rechargeable battery technologies are being pursued as an alternative to lithium, in part due to the relative abundance of sodium compared to lithium. Despite their low dielectric constant, glyme-based electrolytes are particularly attractive for these sodium-based batteries due to their ability to chelate with the sodium ion and their high electrochemical stability. While the glyme chain length is a parameter that can be tuned to modify solvation properties, charge transport behavior, reactivity, and ultimately battery performance, anion identity provides another tunable variable. Trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate/OTf) and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide (TFSI) are chemically similar anions, which are often used in battery electrolytes for lithium-based batteries. In this paper, molecular simulations are used to examine the differences in ion association and charge transport between sodium salts of these two anions at different salt concentrations in glymes with the increasing chain length. The use of the modified force field developed for NaOTf in glymes for the NaTFSI electrolytes was validated by comparing the TFSI-sodium ion radial distribution functions to the results from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on 1.5 M NaTFSI in diglyme. While the ion association behavior as a function of salt concentration showed similar trends for both NaOTf and NaTFSI in tetraglyme and triglyme electrolytes, the dominant solvation structures for the two sets of electrolytes are distinctly different in the monoglyme and diglyme cases. The conductivity is impacted by both the ion association behavior in these electrolytes and the non-vehicular or hopping transport of the anions in these systems.",Journal of Chemical Physics

The carbonized melamine foam (CMF) is light weight (density: 5.4 mg cm-3; porosity > 97.2%), superhydrophobic (water contact angle: 151 ± 2°), mechanically robust (complete recovery after 80% strain deformation) and highly efficient in crude oil uptake (148.7 g g-1 crude oil at 60 °C). More importantly, the CMF has excellent photo- and Joule-thermal conversion efficiency for significantly reducing the viscosity of heavy crude oil under mild sunlight exposure or a relatively low voltage. These advantages enable CMFs to provide a fast cleanup approach for accidental oil spills under all weather conditions. Continuous oil recovery has also been demonstrated by using a piece of heated CMF and a vacuum pump. Overall, the CMF offers an ideal material solution for addressing large-scale crude oil cleanup through its versatile and efficient cleanup approaches.

Boosting the rate performance of Li-S batteries under high mass-loading of sulfur based on a hierarchical NCNT@Co-CoP nanowire integrated electrode,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulfur batteries (Li-S) have been gradually becoming one of the most promising next-generation storage systems, but their practical application is still limited by the extremely low S loading as well as the poor rate capability. Herein, Li-S batteries with boosting rate performance under high mass-loading of S have been achieved based on the hierarchical NCNT@Co-CoP nanowire integrated electrode. The experiments and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the Co-CoP heterojunction interface simultaneously improves the ion transportation/electron migration, and efficiently confines and catalyzes the conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Moreover, the ex situ scanning electron microscopy image and in situ Raman spectra further demonstrate the obviously reduced volume expansion and efficient catalytic conversion of LiPSs on NCNT@Co-CoP-1 even at a high S loading. As a result, Li-S batteries with the NCNT@Co-CoP cathode deliver superior cyclability and remarkable rate capability with 603.9 mA h g-1 after 900 cycles at 5C. Moreover, a high areal capacity retention of 4.4 mA h cm-2 after 100 cycles at 2C rate can also be achieved even under higher loading (10 mg cm-2) and low E/S ratio (7 μL mg-1), illustrating its great practical application in high-rate performance Li-S batteries.

Structural engineering of metal-organic framework derived tin sulfides for advanced Li/Na storage,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Tin sulfides have attracted considerable attention due to their unique layered structure, large interlayer spacing and high theoretical capacity for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). However, the development of tin sulfides has been limited by their poor rate capability and cycle life. To intrinsically maximize the lithium/sodium storage properties of tin sulfides, herein, a metal-organic framework (MOF) template-based strategy is developed to fabricate SnS2@C and SnS@C for LIBs, as well as 3D hollow rod-like SnS@nitrogen-doped carbon@nitrogen-doped graphene (SnS@NC@NG) to accommodate Na+ behavior in NIBs. The results show that structural/physicochemical characterization helps gain insights into the intrinsic relationships between the sulfidation temperature and crystal structures as well as lithium/sodium storage behaviors. The as-prepared SnS2@C and SnS@C exhibit superior Li+ storage behavior to SnSx-based electrodes benefiting from their unique structures (798.3 mA h g-1 and 850.9 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 after 4000 and 5000 cycles, respectively). Particularly, the resulting SnS@NC@NG demonstrates a robust 3D hollow interacted nanostructure during sodiation/desodiation processes, showing ultrahigh specific capacity, rate capability and excellent cycle lifetimes (501.5 mA h g-1 at 2.0 A g-1 after 5000 cycles).

To promote the catalytic conversion of polysulfides using Ni-B alloy nanoparticles on carbon nanotube microspheres under high sulfur loading and a lean electrolyte,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Despite their high theoretical energy density, the application of lithium-sulfur batteries is seriously hindered by the polysulfide shuttle and sluggish kinetics, especially with high sulfur loading and under low electrolyte usage. Herein, to facilitate the conversion of lithium polysulfides, nickel-boron (Ni-B) alloy nanoparticles, dispersed uniformly on carbon nanotube microspheres (CNTMs), are used as sulfur hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries. It is demonstrated that Ni-B alloy nanoparticles can not only anchor polysulfides through Ni-S and B-S interactions but also exhibit high electrocatalytic capability toward the conversion of intermediate polysulfide species. In addition, the intertwined CNT microspheres provide an additional conductive scaffold in response to the fast electrochemical redox. The enhanced redox kinetics is beneficial to improve the specific capacity and cycling stability of the sulfur cathode, based on the fast conversion of lithium polysulfides and effective deposition of the final sulfide products. Conclusively, the S/Ni-B/CNTM composite delivers a high specific capacity (1112.7 mAh gs-1) along with good cycle performance under both high sulfur loading (8.3 mg cm-2) and a lean electrolyte (3 μL mgs-1). Consequently, this study opens up a path to design new sulfur hosts toward lithium-sulfur batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Interface Reinforcement of a Prussian Blue Cathode Using a Non-Flammable Co-Solvent Cresyl Diphenyl Phosphate for a High-Safety Na-Ion Battery,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.A Prussian blue (PB)-based sodium-ion battery (SIB) is a promising candidate in large-scale electric energy storage. However, its development is hindered by the poor cyclability of the PB cathode and safety problems with a flammable electrolyte. Herein, a non-flammable co-solvent cresyl diphenyl phosphate (CDP) in the electrolyte is proposed to increase the safety associated with PB-based SIBs, due to its effective flame retardancy for the electrolyte and good compatibility with the Na anode. Moreover, the deteriorated electrochemical performance of PB is obviously suppressed with cathode interface reinforcement after using CDP, resulting in excellent cyclability with a capacity retention of 83.1% after 700 cycles. The capacity fading of PB can be effectively suppressed with a protective film of phosphates produced by CDP decomposition, forming FePO4, which can activate low-spin Fe-ion sites in the PB lattice. This work effectively improves the battery safety and interface stability between the PB cathode and the electrolyte using the non-flammable CDP co-solvent, as well as the clarification of a capacity fading mechanism for general PB with considerable Fe(CN)6 vacancies and crystal water.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
"Fabrication of S,N-doped carbon-coated SnS2/SnS heterostructures supported by hollow carbon microspheres for sodium-ion storage","© 2021 Electrochemical Society Inc.. All rights reserved.Developing novel anode materials containing electroactive heterostructures which boost ion and charge transfer kinetics in a carbon matrix is still a great challenge. Here we report on a new smartly designed material: SnS2/SnS p-n heterostructures embedded in S,N-doped carbon layer supported by hollow carbon spheres (C@SnSx@C) by a facile method and applied as negative electrode material in sodium ion batteries. The C@SnSx@C2 (at optimized carbon ratio) negative electrode can deliver an initial reversible capacity of 636.5 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 A·g−1, superior rate capability (265.1 mAh·g−1 at rate of 10.0 A·g−1) and long cycle life (capacity retention of 96.3 % at 1.0 A·g−1 after 150 cycles). The SnS2/SnS p-n heterojunctions provide a lower sodium ion diffusion energy barrier (0.38 eV), higher Na+ adsorption energy (−4.66 eV) and higher electronic conductivity due to an internal electric field according to density functional theory calculations compared to plain SnS. Moreover, S,N-doped carbon facilitates electronic conductivity and buffers the volume changes during the conversion reaction-based SnSx upon sodium insertion and extraction process. Porous hollow carbon spheres contribute to prevent the agglomeration of SnS2/SnS nanosheets and keep the structural integrity. Our findings on this unique material might be extended to other ion battery technologies.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
All-solid-state lithium batteries enabled by sulfide electrolytes: From fundamental research to practical engineering design,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sulfide electrolyte (SE)-based all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) have gained worldwide attention because of their instrinsic safety and higher energy density over conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, poor air stability of SEs, detrimental interfacial reactions, insufficient solid-solid ionic contact, and the large gap between fundamental study and practical engineering have impeded the commercialization of SE-based ASSLBs. This review aims to combine fundamental and engineering perspectives to rationally design practical SE-based ASSLBs with high energy density, covering SEs, interface, and practical all-solid-state pouch cells. First, the latest progress of typical pseudo-binary, pseudo-ternary, and pseudo-quaternary SEs is summarized, and effective strategies to improve ionic conductivity and chemical and electrochemical stability are highlighted. Moreover, challenges and strategies at the cathode and anode interfaces are reviewed separately. Furthermore, advanced in situ characterization techniques are examined to better understand the interface of ASSLBs. Encouraging demonstrations of SE-based all-solid-state lithium-ion and all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries are exemplified. Most importantly, energy-density-oriented all-solid-state pouch cells are designed using practical engineering parameters. The proposed design can serve as a quantitative framework to predict the practical energy density of SE-based all-solid-state pouch cells in future. Finally, future directions and our perspectives in SE-based ASSLBs are presented.",Energy and Environmental Science

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.There is great demand for high-performance, low-cost electrode materials for anodes of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, we report the recovery of carbon materials by treating waste tire rubber via a facile one-step carbonization process. Electrochemical studies revealed that the waste tire carbon anode had a higher reversible capacity than that of commercial graphite and shows the positive effect of ZnS in the waste tire carbon. When used as the anode for LIBs, waste tire carbon shows a high specific capacity of 510.6 mAh·g−1 at 100 mA·g−1 with almost 97% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Even at a high rate of 1 A·g−1, the carbon electrode presents an excellent cyclic capability of 255.1 mAh·g−1 after 3000 cycles.

Defect-free-induced Na+disordering in electrode materials,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.For reaching high-performance of electrode materials, it is generally believed that understanding the structure evolution and heterogeneous alignment effect is the key. Presently, a very simple and universally applicable self-healing method is investigated to prepare defect-free Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) that reach their theoretical capacity as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). For direct imaging of the local structure and the dynamic process at the atomic scale, we deliver a fast ion-conductive nickel-based PBA that enables rapid Na+ extraction/insertion within 3 minutes and a capacity retention of nearly 100% over 4000 cycles. This guest-ion disordered and quasi-zero-strain nonequilibrium solid-solution reaction mechanism provides an effective guarantee for realizing long-cycle life and high-rate capability electrode materials that operate via reversible two-phase transition reaction. Unconventional materials and mechanisms that enable reversible insertion/extraction of ions in low-cost metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) within minutes have implications for fast-charging devices, grid-scale energy storage applications, material discovery, and tailored modification.",Energy and Environmental Science
Hybrid nanoparticles based on cobalt ferrite and gold: Preparation and characterization,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.During the past few decades, hybrid nanoparticles (HNPs) based on a magnetic material and gold have attracted interest for applications in catalysis, diagnostics and nanomedicine. In this paper, magnetic CoFe2O4/Au HNPs with an average particle size of 20 nm, decorated with 2 nm gold clusters, were prepared using methionine as a reducer and an anchor between CoFe2O4 and gold. The methionine was used to grow the Au clusters to a solid gold shell (up to 10 gold deposition cycles). The obtained nanoparticles (NPs) were studied by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), transmis-sion electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-vis spectroscopy techniques. The TEM images of the obtained HNPs showed that the surface of cobalt ferrite was covered with gold nanoclusters, the size of which slightly increased with an increase in the number of gold deposition cycles (from 2.12 ± 0.15 nm after 1 cycle to 2.46 ± 0.13 nm after 10 cycles). The density of the Au clusters on the cobalt ferrite surface insignificantly decreased during repeated stages of gold deposition: 21.4 ± 2.7 Au NPs/CoFe2O4 NP after 1 cycle, 19.0 ± 1.2 after 6 cycles and 18.0 ± 1.4 after 10 cycles. The magnetic measurements showed that the obtained HNPs possessed typical ferrimagnetic behavior, which corresponds to that of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. The toxicity evaluation of the synthesized HNPs on Chlorella vulgaris indicated that they can be applied to biomedical applications such as magnetic hyperthermia, photothermal therapy, drug delivery, bioimaging and biosensing.",Metals

N-doped hollow carbon spheres with controllable shell numbers for high-performance electrical double-layer capacitors,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Currently, hollow carbon spheres (HCS)-based supercapacitors are gained tremendous interest due to their excellent electrochemical property. However, the inferior structural stability and unsatisfactory space utilization restrict the applications for high power devices. Herein, a kind of novel N-doped HCS (N-HCS) with controllable shell numbers is constructed by layer-by-layer assembly of polydopamine (PDA) and polypyrrole (PPy) layers on carboxyl modified polystyrene (PS–COOH) spheres. Compared with single-shelled N-HCS, the optimize N-HCS with 4 shells (N-HCS-4) exhibits improved specific surface area from 43.9 m2 g−1 to 1110.2 m2 g−1, which provides a large accessible surface area for the electrolyte, thereby facilitating the ion diffusion and electron transportation. Meanwhile, the doping heteroatom endows N-HCS with the additional pseudocapacitance. Very interestingly, the significant electrochemical properties of N-HCS at the varied coating sequence and number of PDA and PPy layers indicate the formation of the optimal microstructure, which could match with the electrolyte ion size for accelerating the capacitive response. The assemble asymmetrical supercapacitor displays a high energy density of 41.18 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 250 W kg−1, and excellent cycling stability of 99.1% over 10,000 cycles due to the improved structural stability from the synergistic effect in different shells.",Journal of Power Sources

An Attempt to Formulate Non-Carbonate Electrolytes for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2020 The Authors. Batteries & Supercaps published by Wiley-VCH GmbHNon-aqueous carbonate solvents have been the main choice for the development of lithium-ion batteries, and similarly most research on sodium-ion batteries have been performed using carbonate-based solvents. However, the differences between sodium and lithium batteries – in term chemistry/electrochemistry properties as well as electrode materials used – open up opportunities to have a new look at solvents that have attracted little attention as electrolyte solvent. This work investigates properties of a wide range of different solvent classes in the context of sodium-ion battery electrolytes and compares them to the performance of propylene carbonate. The thirteen solvents studied here include one or several members of glymes, carbonates, lactones, esters, pyrrolidones, sulfones, and alkyl phosphates. Out of those, five outperforming solvents of γ-butyrolactone (GBL), γ-valerolactone (GVL), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), propylene carbonate (PC), and trimethyl phosphate (TMP) were further investigated using additives of ethylene sulfite (ES), vinylene carbonate (VC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), prop-1-ene-1,3-sultone (PES), sulfolane (TMS), tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphite (TTSPI), and sodium bis(oxalato)borate (NaBOB). The solvents TMS and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) were tested in 1 : 1 mixtures by volume with the co-solvents; NMP, dimethoxyethane (DME), and TMP. All electrolytes used NaPF6 as the salt. Primary evaluation relied on electrochemical cycling of full-cell sodium-ion batteries consisting of Prussian white cathodes and hard-carbon anodes. Galvanostatic cycling was performed using both two- and three-electrode cells, in addition, cyclic and linear sweep voltammetry was used to further evaluate the electrolyte formulations. Moreover, the resistance was measured on the anode and cathode, using Intermittent current interruption (ICI) technique.",Batteries and Supercaps
Artificial SEI for Superhigh-Performance K-Graphite Anode,"© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHAlthough graphite with its merits of low cost, abundance, and environmental friendliness is a potential anode material for potassium ion batteries (PIBs), it suffers from a limited cycle life due to a severe decomposition of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) in organic electrolytes. Herein, a simple and viable method is demonstrated for the first time through which an ultra-thin, uniform, dense, and stable artificial inorganic SEI film can be prepared on commercial graphite anodes and used with traditional carbonate electrolytes to achieve PIBs with long-cycle stability and high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Specifically, such commercial graphite anodes exhibit a long-term cycling stability for more than 1000 cycles at 100 mA g−1 (a reversible capacity of around 260 mAh g−1) and a high average CE (around 99.9%) in traditional carbonate electrolytes with no discernable decay in capacity. More importantly, the commercial graphite anodes with the artificial inorganic SEI film in traditional carbonate electrolytes can deliver a high ICE of 93% (the highest ICE ever reported for PIBs anodes until now), which improves the performance of the PIB full cell. Considering the high ICE and long cycle stability performance, this study can promote the rapid deployment of PIBs on a commercial scale.",Advanced Science
Highly stable Na metal anode enabled by a multifunctional hard carbon skeleton,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdSodium (Na) metal and hard carbon are regarded as promising and competitive alternatives as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Constructing a Na metal/hard carbon composite anode to exert a synergistic effect on the electrochemical performance of SIBs is highly desirable but rarely reported. In this work, we report a Na metal/N-functionalized hard carbon (NHC) composite as a high-performance anode for SIBs. The introduction of the N-functionalized groups transforms the surface chemistry of the hard carbon from sodiophobic to sodiophilic, thus significantly promoting the dispersion of the hard carbon in Na metal and facilitating the formation of an intimate interfacial contact between them. In addition, during Na stripping/plating cycling, the sodiated NHC particles homogenize the local electron distribution, while the desodiated NHC particles function as an artificial SEI film, which facilitate the bottom-up deposition of Na due to electron concentration gradient and mechanically inhibit the growth of Na dendrites. Consequently, the Na–NHC anode in the symmetric cell exhibits excellent cycling stability up to 1700 h without a short circuit, which significantly exceeds that of the bare Na anode. In the full cell with the Na–NHC anode, NaTi2(PO4)3 exhibits a significantly extended cycling life.",Carbon
Regulation of carbon distribution to construct high-sulfur-content cathode in lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Science PressLithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery is regarded as one of the most promising next-generation energy storage systems due to the ultra-high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg−1. To address the insulation nature of sulfur, nanocarbon composition is essential to afford acceptable cycling capacity but inevitably sacrifices the actual energy density under working conditions. Therefore, rational structural design of the carbon/sulfur composite cathode is of great significance to realize satisfactory electrochemical performances with limited carbon content. Herein, the cathode carbon distribution is rationally regulated to construct high-sulfur-content and high-performance Li–S batteries. Concretely, a double-layer carbon (DLC) cathode is prepared by fabricating a surface carbon layer on the carbon/sulfur composite. The surface carbon layer not only provides more electrochemically active surfaces, but also blocks the polysulfide shuttle. Consequently, the DLC configuration with an increased sulfur content by nearly 10 wt% renders an initial areal capacity of 3.40 mAh cm−2 and capacity retention of 83.8% during 50 cycles, which is about two times than that of the low-sulfur-content cathode. The strategy of carbon distribution regulation affords an effective pathway to construct advanced high-sulfur-content cathodes for practical high-energy-density Li–S batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
A rechargeable all-solid-state sodium peroxide (Na2O2) battery with low overpotential,"© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.Na-O2 batteries have been attracting attention owing to their intrinsically high theoretical energy density. Several Na-O2 systems can produce various discharge products with different electrochemical performances. For example, sodium superoxide (NaO2) batteries have a low overpotential, and sodium peroxide (Na2O2) batteries have a high capacity. Studies of Na2O2 batteries are relatively scarce, owing to the difficulty of forming pure Na2O2 discharge products. A pure Na2O2 battery system is highly desirable for fully exploring the formation and decomposition of Na2O2 in Na-O2 batteries and evaluating their potential. This model of a Na2O2 battery should also be compatible with in situ characterization. To this end, we constructed a simple rechargeable all-solid-state Na2O2 battery. Using a nanoporous gold film as the cathode and Na-β″-Al2O3 as a solid electrolyte, we assembled a Na-O2 battery that can produce and decompose Na2O2. The all-solid-state Na-O2 battery is a simple model for conducting in situ ambient-pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) investigations. The battery can be cycled at a low overpotential (≈450 mV). Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the APXPS and Raman results demonstrated that Na2O2 was the main discharge product and its transformation occurred during the charge and discharge periods. The operando investigation of this type of all-solid-state Na2O2 battery can help in the comprehensive exploration of the potential of Na-O2 batteries.",Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics
Multi-ion Strategy toward Highly Durable Calcium/Sodium-Sulfur Hybrid Battery,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Nonlithium (Li) metal-sulfur batteries are a viable technology for large-scale energy storage due to their relative high energy densities and low cost. However, their practical application is still hindered by the insufficient reversibility and/or limited cycling stability. Herein, we report a high-performance calcium/sodium-sulfur (Ca/Na-S) hybrid battery enabled by a multi-ion chemistry. The introduction of Na ions in the electrolyte greatly boosts the conversion of Ca polysulfides, which has been verified by theoretical calculation and experimental investigation. Meanwhile, the presence of Ca ions constructs a protective electrostatic shield around the initial protrusions on the Na metal anode without prereduction, thus efficiently suppressing the Na dendrite growth. The as-developed Ca/Na-S cell exhibited a high reversible capacity of 947 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C with long cycle life, clearly demonstrating the feasibility of this multi-ion strategy for developing low-cost non-Li metal-sulfur batteries.",Nano Letters
Amide-based deep eutectic solvents containing LiFSI and NaFSI salts as superionic electrolytes for supercapacitor applications,"© 2021 Author(s).This work proposes two deep eutectic solvents (DESs) based on lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide and sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide together with N-methylacetamide and formamide as electrolytes for activated carbon (AC) electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) at 25 °C. The formulated DESs exhibit a large electrochemical window (ΔE > 2.5 V), good thermal stability (∼150 °C) and ionic conductivity (3-4 mS cm−1), and moderate viscosity (11.3 mPa s). Through the Vogel-Tamman-Vulcher fitting equation, the evolution of pseudo-energy activation was delineated with respect to the nature of the H-bond donor or alkali salt. These electrolytes present a superionic character gleaned from the Walden classification, and their ionicity exceeds that of standard organic electrolytes based on similar alkali salts. The performance of the AC-based EDLC was assessed by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge/discharge, yielding 140 F g−1 with an 8% capacity retention during 200 h of floating. Based on the physicochemical properties and electrochemical performance of these DESs, they represent a promising green-alternative electrolyte for supercapacitor applications.",Journal of Chemical Physics

Covalent Coupling-Stabilized Transition-Metal Sulfide/Carbon Nanotube Composites for Lithium/Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Transition-metal sulfides (TMSs) powered by conversion and/or alloying reactions are considered to be promising anode materials for advanced lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the limited electronic conductivity and large volume expansion severely hinder their practical application. Herein, we report a covalent coupling strategy for TMS-based anode materials using amide linkages to bind TMSs and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In the synthesis, the thiourea acts as not only the capping agent for morphology control but also the linking agent for the covalent coupling. As a proof of concept, the covalently coupled ZnS/CNT composite (CC-ZnS/CNT) has been prepared, with ZnS nanoparticles (μ10 nm) tightly anchored on CNT bundles. The compact ZnS-CNT heterojunctions are greatly beneficial to facilitating the electron/ion transfer and ensuring structural stability. Due to the strong coupling interaction between ZnS and CNTs, the composite presents prominent pseudocapacitive behavior and highly reversible electrochemical processes, thus leading to superior long-term stability and excellent rate capability, delivering reversible capacities of 333 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 over 4000 cycles for LIBs and 314 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 after 500 cycles for SIBs. Consequently, CC-ZnS/CNT exhibits great competence for applications in LIBs and SIBs, and the covalent coupling strategy is proposed as a promising approach for designing high-performance anode materials.",ACS Nano
Binder-free and high-loading sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode for lithium/sulfur batteries,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is a promising active material for Li/S batteries owing to its high sulfur utilization and long-term cyclability. However, because SPAN electrodes are synthesized using powder, they require large amounts of electrolyte, conducting agents, and binder, which reduces the practical energy density. Herein, to improve the practical energy density, we fabricated bulk-type SPAN disk cathodes from pressed sulfur and polyacrylonitrile powders using a simple heating process. The SPAN disks could be used directly as cathode materials because their π-π structures provide molecular-level electrical connectivity. In addition, the electrodes had interconnected pores, which improved the mobility of Li+ ions by allowing homogeneous adsorption of the electrolyte. The specific capacity of the optimal electrode was very high (517 mA h gelectrode-1). Furthermore, considering the weights of the anode, separator, cathode, and electrolyte, the Li/S cell exhibited a high practical energy density of 250 W h kg-1. The areal capacity was also high (8.5 mA h cm-2) owing to the high SPAN loading of 16.37 mg cm-2. After the introduction of 10 wt% multi-walled carbon nanotubes as a conducting agent, the SPAN disk electrode exhibited excellent cyclability while maintaining a high energy density. This strategy offers a potential candidate for Li/S batteries with high practical energy densities.",RSC Advances
Yolk@Shell Structured MnS@Nitrogen-Doped Carbon as a Sulfur Host and Polysulfide Conversion Booster for Lithium/Sodium Sulfur Batteries,"© Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been regarded as an important candidate for next-generation energy storage devices due to their low cost and high theoretical energy density. However, several factors retard the practical use of Li-S batteries including the slow kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) transformation as well as the shuttle effect induced by the diffusion of LiPS that damages the cycling stability of Li-S batteries. In this study, a yolk@shell structured MnS@nitrogen-doped carbon (MnS@N-C) is developed as the S host and polysulfide conversion booster, which offers both the physical confinement of S species and accelerated kinetics toward LiPS catalytic conversion. As a result, the developed S/yolk@shell MnS@N-C delivers a higher rate performance compared to S/yolk@shell MnO@N-C and S/N-C and long cycle life with a remaining capacity of 636.1 mAh g-1 after 330 cycles at 0.5C. When equipped with MnS@N-C functional separators, S/yolk@shell MnS@N-C retains a capacity of 504.2 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1C. In addition, S/yolk@shell MnS@N-C also delivers a decent capacity decay of 0.16% per cycle after 300 cycles at 0.5C in a room-temperature Na-S battery.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Sulfur in Amorphous Silica for an Advanced Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Battery,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe room-temperature (RT) Na/S battery is a promising energy storage system owing to suitable operating temperature, high theoretical energy density, and low cost. However, it has a poor cycle life and low reversible capacity. In this work, we report a long-life RT-Na/S battery with amorphous porous silica as a sulfur host. The sulfur is loaded into amorphous silica by a dipping method; the optimal sulfur loading is up to 73.48 wt %. Molecular dynamics simulation and first-principles calculations suggest that the complex pores, acting as micro-containers and the formation of Na-O chemical bonds between amorphous silica and sodium polysulfide, give the electrodes a strong ability to inhibit sodium polysulfide shuttle. This would give rise to effectively avoiding the loss of active sulfur, corresponding to a superior capacity and an excellent cyclability even at 10 A gsulfur−1 (nearly 100 % coulomb efficiency and high reversible capacity of 955.8 mAh gsulfur−1 after 1460 cycles).",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Spinel LiMn2O4nanoparticles fabricated by the flexible soft template/Pichini method as cathode materials for aqueous lithium-ion capacitors with high energy and power density,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Spinel LiMn2O4 (LMO) with a three-dimensional structure has become one of the cathode materials that has gained the most interest due to its safety, low price and abundant resources. However, the lithium ion transmission is limited by large particle size and particle agglomeration of LMO. Thus, reducing the particle size and agglomeration of LMO can effectively improve its lithium ion transmission. Here, we synthesized a LMO cathode material with a nanoscale crystal size using the flexible expanded graphite (EG) soft template and Pichini method. EG-controlled particle size and particle agglomeration of LMO is conducive to charge transfer and diffusion of lithium ions between LMO and the electrolyte, meanwhile, there are more redox sites on the nanosized LMO particles, which makes the redox reaction of LMO more thorough during the charge and discharge process, resulting in high capacitance performance. In order to obtain the considerably required lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) with high energy density and power density, we assembled aqueous LMO//activated carbon (AC) LICs with 5 M LiNO3 as the aqueous electrolytes, which are environmentally friendly, safe, low cost and have higher electrical conductivity than organic electrolytes. The optimal LIC has an energy density of 32.63 W h kg-1 at a power density of 500 W kg-1 and an energy density of 8.06 W h kg-1 at a power density of 10 000 W kg-1, which is higher than most of the LMO-based LICs in previous reports. After 2000 cycles, the specific capacitance retention rate was 75.9% at a current density of 3 A g-1. Therefore, our aqueous LMO//AC LICs synthesized by the soft template/Pichini method have wide prospects and are suitable for low-cost, high-safety and high-power applications.",RSC Advances
"Metal-organic framework-based materials: Advances, exploits, and challenges in promoting post Li-ion battery technologies","© The Royal Society of Chemistry.After exclusive research for three decades on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), can there be anything unexplored, unmapped, or unexplained? Synthetic processes, fundamental characteristics, and their suitability for various applications have previously been broadly highlighted elsewhere. It is time, however, to focus on their prospect of application in the field of post-lithium batteries. Considering the perpetual rise in the demand for safer rechargeable batteries and an urgent need to refrain from Li-based batteries, which is attributed to the limited supply of lithium, a serious consideration regarding the implementation of post-lithium rechargeable batteries at a commercial level is needed. Even though post-lithium batteries seem to be an effective solution to refrain from the excessive use of a limited reserves of lithium, several concerns are still needed to be addressed before they can be recognized for practical applications. MOFs can prove to be advantageous in providing aid for the design of electrode materials with better stability and conductivity for metal-ion batteries, act as catalysts for improving the reaction kinetics in metal-air batteries, and serve as hosts for sulfur encapsulation in metal-sulfur batteries. Currently available reviews focus mainly on the use of MOFs and MOF-based materials for Li-based rechargeable batteries. This survey aims to highlight the problems and their possible solutions in cutting-edge post-lithium batteries implementing MOFs and MOF-based materials, together with highlighting the remarkable works that have been carried out to understand the various design aspects of electrode materials so as to direct future research in this regime.",Materials Advances
MOF-Derived CoS2/N-Doped Carbon Composite to Induce Short-Chain Sulfur Molecule Generation for Enhanced Sodium-Sulfur Battery Performance,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Dissolution of intermediate sodium polysulfides (Na2Sx; 4≤x≤8) is a crucial obstacle for the development of room-temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries. One promising strategy to avoid this issue is to load short-chain sulfur (S2-4), which could prohibit the generation of soluble polysulfides during the sodiation process. Herein, unlike in the previous reported cases where short-chain sulfur was stored by confinement within a small-pore-size (≤0.5 nm) carbon host, we report a new strategy to generate short-chain sulfur in larger pores (>0.5 nm) by the synergistic catalytic effect of CoS2 and appropriate pore size. Based on density functional theory calculations, we predict that CoS2 can serve as a catalyst to weaken the S-S bond in the S8 ring structure, facilitating the formation of short-chain sulfur molecules. By experimentally tuning the pore size of the CoS2-based hosts and comparing their performances as cathodes in Na-S and Li-S batteries, we conclude that such a catalytic effect depends on the proximity of sulfur to CoS2. This avoids the generation of soluble polysulfides and results in superior electrochemical properties of the composite materials introduced here for Na-S batteries. As a result, the optimized CoS2/N-doped carbon/S electrode showed excellent electrochemical performance with high reversible specific capacities of 488 mA h g-1 (962 mA h g(s)-1) after 100 cycles (0.1 A g-1) and 403 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles (1 A g-1) with a superior rate performance (262 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1).",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Initial investigation of bimetal hydroxysulfide as a new anode material for efficient sodium-ion storage,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Various transition metal compounds (TMCs) such as metal oxide, metal sulfide, and metal selenide have been developed owing to the continous efforts devoted for exploring novel and efficient anode materials for alkali metal-ion (Li+/Na+) batteries. In this study, to synthesize a new anode candidate, multicomponent hybridization of metal hydroxide and metal chalcogenide is applied for inducing the active reaction with Na-ions by formation of heterostructured metal hydroxide/metal chalcogenide during the first cycle. As a first target material, cobalt-iron hydroxysulfide was prepared through room-temperature sulfurization by simply immersing cobalt-iron hydroxide into a solution of Na2S. To understand the conversion reaction mechanism of cobalt-iron hydroxysulfide in sodium-ion storage in detail, various in-situ electrochemical analysis and ex-situ TEM and XPS analysis were conducted. The reversible conversion reaction after the first cycle can be estimated by the following equation: Co + Fe + 4NaOH + 4Na2S ↔ Co(OH)2 + Fe(OH)2 + CoS2 + NaxFeS2 + (12-x)Na+ + (12-x)e−. Heterostructured metal hydroxide/metal sulfide nanocomposite was formed after the initial cycle, which provided excellent electrochemical properties. Moreover, to efficiently apply cobalt-iron hydroxysulfide, hollow carbon nanospheres uniformly embedding cobalt-iron hydroxysulfide were synthesized by a vacuum process. Yolk-shell structured cobalt-iron hydroxysulfide-C composite nanospheres showed a stable cycle performance (285 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g−1) and superior rate capability (307 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 5.0 A g−1).",Chemical Engineering Journal

The phase, microstructure, and electrochemical properties of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 microtubes and their composite electrolytes are systematically investigated based on X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, linear sweep voltammetry, direct-current polarization, and galvanostatic cycling.

Trifunctional Electrolyte Additive Hexadecyltrioctylammonium Iodide for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries with Extended Cycle Life,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery with a very high theoretical energy density (∼2500 Wh kg-1) is a very promising alternative to the commercial lithium-ion battery as the next-generation energy storage device. However, the Li-S battery suffers from shuttle effect and Li dendrites growth due to the solubility of polysulfides in the electrolyte system and the inhomogeneous deposition of Li, resulting in short cycling life span, which is the major obstacle in its practical application. Herein, we report an additive, hexadecyltrioctylammonium iodide (HTOA-I), in the conventional electrolyte system, which shows trifunctional effect on extending Li-S battery cycle life. It can not only help us to form a protective solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) on the surface of Li anode so as to reduce the contact of polysulfides with Li but also hinder the shuttling of polysulfides to the Li anode due to the strong combination of large-sized HTOA+ with polysulfide anions (Sn2-), which retard the migration of Sn2- and cause homogeneous Li deposition owing to the large size and stronger trend of HTOA+ to be absorbed on Li anode as well. A new method of phosphorescence analysis for direct observation of polysulfides shuttling has been put forward for the first time, which can be further developed in future studies. The cell with the HTOA-I-added electrolyte system shows high cycling stability, retaining 83.4% of the initial capacity after 200 cycles at 1 A g-1 and achieving 689 mAh g-1 even after 1000 cycles. This cost-effective and facile approach will not increase the complexity of the battery manufacturing process. Compared to other electrolyte additives, the additive in our work, HTOA-I, has better positive effects on extending cycle life. This trifunctional electrolyte additive will inspire the design of other new additives and further promote the development of Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

A facile method to stabilize sodium metal anodes towards high-performance sodium batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Sodium metal is the ultimate anode for next generation high-energy-density sodium metal batteries due to its superior theoretical specific capacity, low redox potential, and natural abundance. However, sodium metal suffers from extreme and uncontrollable dendrite growth and gas evolution problems. These incidents result in a low coulombic efficiency and safety issues such as dangerous short circuits. Herein, an effective protective layer is fabricated on the Na metal anodeviaan extremely facile pretreatment method with 1,3-dioxolane. The protective layer exhibits fast interfacial transport and a lower resistance. Direct optical visualization shows that dendrite growth and gas evolution are suppressed due to the introduction of the protective layer. As a result, an outstanding cycling stability for 2800 h (1400 cycles) at 1 mA cm−2in a symmetric cell is obtained. Moreover, the full cell using the protected Na metal anode shows superior electrochemical performance in comparison to the untreated Na metal anode. Furthermore, large format protected Na metal anodes fabricated by spraying 1,3-dioxolane were demonstrated and successfully assembled in pouch cells, showing a stable specific capacity of around 95 mA h g−1.

Commercialisation of high energy density sodium-ion batteries: Faradion's journey and outlook,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.There is no doubt that rechargeable batteries will play a huge role in the future of the world. Sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries might be the ideal middle-ground between high performance delivered by the modern lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery, desire for low costs and long-term sustainability. To commercialise the Na-ion technology, Faradion was founded in 2011 as the world's first non-aqueous Na-ion battery company. Over the years, we have made rapid progress in increasing the all-around performance of Na-ion batteries, benefitting from decades' worth of industry experience and prior Na-ion as well as Li-ion academic research. The Faradion Na-ion chemistry can now exceed the energy densities of LiFePO4//graphite Li-ion batteries with rapidly converging cycle lives, similar rate performance and charge acceptance. In addition, our technology makes use of lower materials costs, offers improved safety through the use of high flash point electrolytes and has the ability to be discharged to zero volts for storage and transportation. In this article, Faradion's step-by-step progress in the Na-ion technology will be discussed together with a general picture of how our Na-ion chemistry compares with other Na-ion systems and commercially available Li-ion technology. Finally, the importance of starting experimental testing on new materials, keeping commercially-relevant protocols in mind, will be illustrated by clearly highlighting the drastic effects of some crucial experimental factors. By sharing such industry know-how, Faradion hopes researchers worldwide will adopt such experimental protocols as routine methodology in the laboratory.

Structural and electronic engineering of biomass-derived carbon nanosheet composite for electrochemical oxygen reduction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Developing efficient, non-noble, and reliable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to replace the precious metal Pt/C catalyst remains a colossal challenge. In this study, pomelo peel (PP) was used to obtain N/S, Ta-doped carbonaceous-based composite electrocatalystviaa two-step microwave-assisted pyrolysis method. We found that the chemical pretreatment was crucial to isolate cellulose fibers and obtain the nanosheet-structure precursors from irregularly structured biomass and to yield structural defects induced by N, S co-doping. The latter serves as an active site to anchor TaOx, forming active ORR species. The obtained cell-PP-NS-700-Ta-900 composite exhibited most promising electrocatalytic activities (half-wave potential of 0.82 V (vs.RHE), a limiting current density of −5.24 mA cm−2, and an electron transfer number of 3.87) in 0.1 M KOH solution, which are comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C electrode, while the former presented better selectivity and short-term durability. The synergy of the formed multi-heterointerface/chemical phases of Ta-based compounds and high content of N-pyridinic, N-quaternary, and N-nitride (metal-N) nitrogen functionalities in carbon were experimentally revealed as the major feature contributing to the enhanced ORR activity.

Tunable Electrocatalytic Behavior of Sodiated MoS2 Active Sites toward Efficient Sulfur Redox Reactions in Room-Temperature Na–S Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHRoom-temperature (RT) sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries hold great promise for large-scale energy storage due to the advantages of high energy density, low cost, and resource abundance. The research progress on RT Na–S batteries, however, has been greatly hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions. Herein, an elaborate multifunctional architecture, consisting of N-doped carbon skeletons and tunable MoS2 sulfiphilic sites, is fabricated via a simple one-pot reaction followed by in situ sulfurization. Beyond the physical confinement and chemical binding of polarized N-doped carbonaceous microflowers, the MoS2 active sites play a key role in catalyzing polysulfide redox reactions, especially the conversion from long-chain Na2Sn (4 ≤ n ≤ 8) to short-chain Na2S2 and Na2S. Significantly, the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 can be tunable via adjusting the discharge depth. It is remarkable that the sodiated MoS2 exhibits much stronger binding energy and electrocatalytic behavior compared to MoS2 sites, effectively enhancing the formation of the final Na2S product. Consequently, the S cathode achieves superior electrochemical performance in RT Na–S batteries, delivering a high capacity of 774.2 mAh g−1 after 800 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, and an ultrahigh capacity retention with a capacity decay rate of only 0.0055% per cycle over 2800 cycles.",Advanced Materials

Isotropous Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Interlayer with Homogeneous Na+ Flux Dynamics for Solid-State Na Metal Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHInorganic solid-state electrolyte (SSE) based Na-metal batteries have received extensive attention in next-generation lithium-free energy storage systems with both high-security and superior electrochemical performance. Herein, in contrast to the conventionally used polymer/ceramic/polymer sandwich electrolyte, an efficient green and scalable powder-polishing synthetic method is developed to fabricate a pyrolyzed-polyacrylonitrile modified Na super ionic conductor (NASICON) electrolyte to relieve polarization of integrated composite SSE and ameliorate interfacial contact between the electrolyte and the Na anode. Furthermore, introducing S in the preferable isotropous sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) interlayer can trigger dehydrogenation and cyclization of polyacrylonitrile with chemically-bonded short-chain S S segments, which can bond with Na+ to redistribute the interfacial electric field and homogenize transported Na+ flux, leading to transition of Na deposition behavior from dendrite growth mode to lateral flat-shape growth tendency. The conjugated polymer backbones possess delocalized radicals that can activate formed short-chain sulfides to reconnect to the backbones, thus maintaining superior structural stability. Benefiting from the rational interfacial design, a record-high value of 1.4 mA cm-2 for critical current density of Na/SPAN-NASICON/Na cells is obtained. Moreover, SPAN is used as a cathode to assemble solid-state Na/SPAN-NASICON/SPAN Na-organosulfur batteries, demonstrating superior capacity and cycling-stability.

However, the physicochemical properties of SPAN correlate with the synthesis and process conditions. In this work, flexible and freestanding SPAN nanofiber cathodes are prepared via the electrospinning technique followed by a sulfurization process. And the effect of synthesis temperatures on microstructure and electrochemical performance of SPAN are systematically investigated. According to the spectroscopic analysis, short –Sx– (2 ≤ x ≤ 3) chains are covalently bonded to the cyclized and dehydrogenated PAN backbones through C–S bonds during the synthesis temperature between 300 and 600 °C. Among which, the SPAN nanofiber prepared at 500 °C shows not only a low charge transfer resistance but also the best cell performance.

High-Capacity and Stable Sodium-Sulfur Battery Enabled by Confined Electrocatalytic Polysulfides Full Conversion,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe efficient polysulfide capture and reversible sulfur recovery during reverse charging process are critical to exploiting the full potential of room temperature Na-S batteries. Here, based on a core-shell design strategy, the structural and chemical synergistic manipulation of sodium polysulfides quasi-solid-state reversible conversion is proposed. The sulfur is encapsulated in the multi-pores of 3D interconnected carbon fiber as the core structure. The Fe(CN)64−-doped polypyrrole film serves as a redox-active polar shell to lock up polysulfides and promote complete polysulfide conversion. Importantly, the short-chain Na2S4 polysulfides are reduced to Na2S directly leaving with a small fraction of soluble intermediates as the cation-transfer medium at the core/shell interface, and freeing up formation of solid Na2S2 incomplete product. Further, the redox mediator with open Fe species electrocatalytically lowers the Na2S oxidation energy barrier and renders the high reversibility of electrodeposited Na2S. The tunable quasi-solid-state reversible sulfur conversion under versatile polymer sheath greatly enhances sulfur utilization, affording a remarkable capacity of 1071 mAh g−1 and a stable high capacity of 700 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 200 cycles.

After dehydration, the two structures are transformed into orthorhombic β-phase MnC2O4 with similar morphologies to their precursors. Mesoporous MnC2O4 rod can be obtained from the precursor prepared at 100 °C. When used as an anode material for LIBs, this mesoporous MnC2O4 rod delivers a high reversible capacity of 905 and 822 mAh·g−1 after 150 cycles at 2 and 4 A·g−1, respectively, exhibiting good cycle stability and rate performance. The enhanced performance can be attributed to the mesoporous rod-like structure that can improve the structural stability and accelerate the electrode kinetics.",Ionics
A novel approach towards evaluation of joint technology performances of battery energy storage system in a fuzzy environment,"© 2021The joint technological features of battery energy storage systems (BESSs), which are a strategic reserve resource with different operating systems, make it possible for these technologies to be comparable with each other. However, technology needs to be evaluated with stakeholders in the energy system to eliminate some engineering and feasibility concerns, to be included in energy storage policies, and to be utilizable. This aim has involved a high level of complexity and uncertainty, as well as many qualitative and quantitative criteria in both technology and stakeholder assessment. Therefore, in the study, Pythagorean Fuzzy (PF) sets, which offer the decision-maker the advantage of a wide evaluation scale, were used with AHP-TOPSIS combination, which has proven effective in many different applications in the literature. The first use of this methodology for joint technology performance evaluation of BESSs will be a visionary contribution to the literature. In the case study, 5 different BESSs (Lead-acid, Lithium-ion, Vanadium redox flow battery, Sodium nickel chloride, Sodium-sulfur) alternatives have been evaluated with the joint technological criteria of these alternatives. The results show that the most important criteria in battery performance are lifetime calendric, energy rating/discharge time, and life cycle criteria, respectively. Another conclusion of the case study is that while the rapidly developing Lithium-ion battery takes the first place in future projections, it takes second place in Lead-acid batteries, which are mature technology.",Journal of Energy Storage
Research Progress and Future Perspectives on Rechargeable Na-O2 and Na-CO2 Batteries,"© 2021 Zhengzhou UniversityRechargeable sodium–oxygen (Na-O2) and sodium–carbon dioxide (Na-CO2) batteries have attracted intensive research attention in recent years owing to their advantages of high theoretical energy density, modest cost, abundance of sodium resources, and promising potential for achieving real sodium–air batteries in large-scale energy storage systems. Nevertheless, current research on Na-O2 and Na-CO2 batteries is facing enormous challenges, such as low energy efficiency and limited cycle life, which are restricting their progress at the initial stage. Therefore, understanding their working principles, and the chemical and electrochemical reactions of the electrodes is indispensable to achieve their practical application and even the goal of true sodium–air batteries. This review aims to provide an overview of the research developments and future perspectives on Na-O2 and Na-CO2 batteries, which include the major aspects, such as working mechanisms, air cathode materials design strategies, sodium anode protection, and electrolyte stability.

3D Ag@C Cloth for Stable Anode Free Sodium Metal Batteries,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHWhile sodium metal anodes (SMAs) feature many performance advantages in sodium ion batteries (SIBs), severe safety concerns remain for using bulk sodium electrodes. Herein, a 3D Ag@C natrophilic substrate prepared by a facile thermal evaporation deposition method, which can be employed as a much safer “anode-free” SMA, is reported. Initially, there is no bulk sodium on the Ag@C substrate in the assembled SIBs. Upon charging, sodium will be uniformly deposited onto the Ag@C substrate and afterwards functions as a real SMA, thus inheriting the intrinsic merits of SMA and enhancing safety simultaneously. While cycling, the as-synthesized substrate demonstrates superior sodium plating/stripping cycling stability at 1, 2 and 3 mA cm−2 with a capacity of 2 mAh cm−2. Theoretical simulations reveal that Na ions prefer to bind with Ag and form a Na-Ag network, thus clearly revealing uniform sodium deposition on the Ag@C substrate. More importantly, a full battery based on Ag@C and Prussian white with impressive Coulomb efficiency (CE), high rate capability (from 0.1 C to 5 C) and long-term cycling life is illustrated for the first time, thus making Ag@C feasible for the establishment of “anode-free” SIBs with reduced cost, high gravimetric/volumetric energy density and enhanced safety.",Small Methods
Step by Step Bisacrificial Templates Growth of Bimetallic Sulfide QDs-Attached MOF Nanosheets for Nonlinear Optical Limiting,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHHere, the authors first report a bimetallic sulfide quantum dots (QDs)-attached metal–organic framework (MOF) nanosheets-based film from bisacrificial templates. By using a step by step bisacrificial templates strategy, MOF CuBDC precursors (BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) and chalcogenidometalates as the templates can successfully in-situ assemble Cu2SnS3 (CTS) QDs-attached CuBDC nanosheets on the functionalized substrate (CTS @ CuBDC film). The obtained CTS QDs possess a uniform size with ≈6.2 nm and are homogeneously dispersed on MOF nanosheets, which results in an improvement of conductivity and represents a semiconductive composite film for optical application. A Z-scan study under the excitation of a 532 nm laser shows that the CTS @ CuBDC film possesses strong optical limiting (OL) behavior and very low OL thresholds (0.92 J cm−2) as well as large third-order nonlinear susceptibility (1.9 × 10−6 esu). This work suggests that the step by step bisacrificial templates method is a fascinating and feasible strategy to prepare metal sulfide QDs dispersed MOF hybrid materials, and provides a promising potential candidate for nonlinear optical applications.",Advanced Optical Materials

Perovskite with in situ exsolved cobalt nanometal heterostructures for high rate and stable lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.In order to solve the fundamental problem of polysulfide shuttle and slow reaction kinetics in lithium-sulfur batteries, we designed a novel adsorption-catalysis bifunctional heterostructure of strontium titanate perovskite and cobalt nanometal (STO@Co) prepared by in situ exsolution. Heterostructure can effectively adsorb polysulfides, which takes advantage of the ferroelectric effect of perovskite. After the in situ exsolution of Co nanometals, the exsolution of conductive metals enhance the conductivity of the heterostructure, while the in situ exsolved Co nanometal has excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability. Because of the superior interface compatibility between the in situ exsolved Co nanometal and perovskite, promote the synergy of adsorption-catalysis performance. The STO@Co electrode delivers higher specific capacity, better long-cycle stability, and rate capability compared to metal-impregnated perovskite heterostructure (STO/Co). This study proposes a new method of in situ exsolution for the preparation of heterostructures, which guides designing efficient battery materials.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Simultaneous defect-engineered and thiol modified of MoO2 for improved catalytic activity in lithium-sulfur batteries: A study of synergistic polysulfide adsorption-conversion function,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Rational design of nanostructure and proper interfacial engineering is of significant in pursuing high performance Li-S batteries. Here we report a strategy to fabricate reduced graphene oxide coated MoO2 with defect engineered and thiol modified nanotubes (H-S@MoO2/rGO) as highly stable host material for cathode in Li-S batteries. Thiourea was used as sulfur source and etching agent to construct the hollow architecture and realize thiol modification of MoO2 with the aid of ethanol. The modifying H-S@MoO2/rGO nanotubes offer improved affinity with LiPSs and accelerating the conversion kinetics from LiPSs to final Li2S. Oxygen vacancy remarkably reduce energy barrier and facilitating charge transfer, improving catalytic activity, regulating the deposition of Li2S on electrode surface. Furthermore, H-S@MoO2/rGO nanotubes offer enough interior capacity for high sulfur loading of 84 wt% (donate as S-S@MoO2/rGO), effectively confine sulfur through confinement effect. The simultaneous defect-engineered and thiol modified of MoO2 effectively cooperate the adsorption, diffusion and conversion of LiPSs in sulfur redox process, synergistically enable host material effective adsorption-conversion function for polysulfide. The developed S-S@MoO2/rGO cathodes exhibit excellent rate performance and superior reliability with a high specific capacity of 927 mAh g−1 and small capacity fading rate of 0.042% per cycle over 500 cycles at 0.1 Ag−1. This work shows a feasible and effective method to analyze the systematic kinetic and in-depth mechanism explanation of functional groups modifying metal oxide to guide the design of effective catalysts for practical application in lithium-sulfur batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Single Li ion conducting solid-state polymer electrolytes based on carbon quantum dots for Li-metal batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdSingle Li ion conducting solid-state polymer electrolytes (SLIC-SPEs) can effectively inhibit the growth of Li dendrites in Li-metal batteries. However, SLIC-SPE synthesis using traditional polymerization methods yields electrolytes with insufficient conductivity, which limits their practical application. Herein, a novel Li+ conductor based on carbon quantum dots (CQDs) is fabricated via the pyrolysis of poly(lithium 4-styrene sulfonate) and citric acid. The large CQD anionic size and hydrogen bonding interaction with matrix hinder anion migration in the polyethylene oxide matrix and thereby grants a high Li+ transport number of 0.9446. Moreover, CQD incorporation improves the mechanical properties and ionic conductivity of the SPEs. The as-prepared SPE membrane demonstrates a high room-temperature ionic conductivity of 2.02 × 10−4 S cm−1. All-solid-state Li-metal batteries fabricated with these SPEs show good cycling stability, rate performance, and capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 2 C and 60 °C. The SPEs also withstand deformations such as bending and twisting.",Nano Energy
Understanding the influencing factors of porous cathode contributions to the impedance of a sodium-nickel chloride (ZEBRA) battery,"© 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.Molten-sodium beta-alumina batteries including sodium-sulfur (NAS) and sodium-metal chloride (ZEBRA) batteries have been considered as promising candidates for reliable low-cost stationary energy storage devices. The structural parameters of the porous cathode wetted by NaAlCl4 have been proved to be one of the important reasons for the degradation of ZEBRA batteries. Herein, the influencing factors of porous cathode on the impedance of Na-NiCl2 battery are investigated in detail. The interface between the NaAlCl4 catholyte and Ni/NaCl cathode material and the ratio of the conductive components in the cathode are discussed in this paper. Based on the wettability results of each component of the cathode material at different porosities and temperatures, the wetting behavior between NaAlCl4 and the porous cathode is summarized. Both the porosity and metal ratio of the cathode need to be considered in order to achieve the optimal catholyte/cathode material interface and minimum operating impedance. The proposed cathode parameters are porosity greater than 24% and conductive component ratio of 1.5 at NaAlCl4 ratio of 1.75. This work provides a quantitative guidance and deep understanding for the material design of ZEBRA battery cathodes.",Functional Materials Letters
Electrochemical deposition mechanism of sodium and potassium,"© 2020Sodium and potassium metal batteries are being developed and studied enthusiastically by researchers, but the electrochemical deposition mechanism of sodium and potassium are still elusive and considered as analogs of the lithium version. In this study, it is found that the deposition of sodium and potassium are different from lithium. During deposition, cations get electrons and turn into metal deposited beneath the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and consequently the SEI is subject to the pressure from the metal around the deposition sites. Under the pressure, the SEI of lithium is strong enough to keep its integrity, which leads to the root growth of deposits. The lithium deposits are whiskers with the diameter of submicrometer and can be blocked by separators with the pores of dozens of nanometers. By contrast, the SEIs of sodium and potassium are weak and break into fragments under the pressure, and the subsequent deposition occur on the metal surfaces. The deposits grow into micro-scale granules and spread through the nanopores of separators, which causes the short circuit.",Energy Storage Materials

New Insights into the N-S Bond Formation of a Sulfurized-Polyacrylonitrile Cathode Material for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (S-cPAN) has been recognized as a particularly promising cathode material for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries due to its ultra-stable cycling performance and high degree of sulfur utilization. Though the synthetic conditions and routes for modification of S-cPAN have been extensively studied, details of the molecular structure of S-cPAN remain yet unclear. Herein, a more reasonable molecular structure consisting of pyridinic/pyrrolic nitrogen (NPD/NPL) is proposed, based on the analysis of combined X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, 13C/15N solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and density functional theory data. The coexistence of vicinal NPD/NPL entities plays a vital role in attracting S2 molecules and facilitating N-S bond formation apart from the generally accepted C-S bond in S-cPAN, which could explain the extraordinary electrochemical features of S-cPAN among various nitrogen-containing sulfurized polymers. This study provides new insights and a better understanding of structural details and relevant bond formation mechanisms in S-cPAN, providing a foundation for the design of new types of sulfurized cathode materials suitable for application in next-generation high-performance Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Metal-organic frameworks as separators and electrolytes for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Due to high energy density and low cost, lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been regarded as the next generation of energy storage systems. As indispensable parts of LSBs, separators and solid electrolytes play an important role in inhibiting dendrite growth and eliminating short-circuit risks. Their development can fundamentally improve the performance of LSBs. In recent years, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as porous crystalline inorganic-organic materials with high porosity, uniform pore size distribution, customizable structure, and easy functionalization, are used as molecular sieves to uniformly deposit lithium ions and combine high-soluble solid solution polysulfides (PSs), which have become an emerging research direction.

Transition metal phosphides: new generation cathode host/separator modifier for Li-S batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Owing to their promising applications including, aircrafts, military field, and submarines, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high energy density (2500 W h kg−1) are emerging as the next-generation energy storage system with low cost to replace lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the road to commercialization is mainly hindered by low coulombic efficiency, poor cycling, and rate capabilities, which are mainly due to the so-called polysulfide (PS) shuttle, sluggish electrochemical reactions,etc.One of the most effective and direct strategies among different optimization methods is to rationally design the cathode host of Li-S batteries. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) feature relatively good electrical performance, mild synthesis, adequate chemical adsorption strength and exceptional catalytic capability for PS, which make them a cathode host/separator modifier for the new generation of Li-S batteries. In this review, the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of Li-S batteries and major roadblocks to commercial applications are firstly described. Following that, we summarize the synthesis strategy of TMPs and systematically review the recent progress on TMPs in Li-S batteries, where light is shed on the specific roles of TMPs as Li-S battery cathodes and separator modifiers, and briefly on the synthesis. In future research on Li-S batteries, the review provides insight into the challenges of TMPs and directions for further development.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Impact on the demand for elements used in battery manufacturing associated with increased fleet of electric and hybrid vehicles,"© 2021 SAE International. All rights reserved.After a few decades forgotten, electric cars are returning to international prominence and becoming a supposed symbol of sustainability. Some countries have announced plans to ban vehicles that use an internal combustion engine and are now promoting incentives for the consumption of hybrids and electric ones. Although the media advertises these models as ""zero-emission""or""green""vehicles as a reference for solving environmental problems, some important issues go unnoticed. Thus, this work aims to make an assessment on the feasibility of massive fleet electrification and address the future demands of metals used in batteries, as well as their environmental impacts. For this purpose, battery technologies with applications in the electric car market were identified and the total volume of most critical metals for a lithium-ion battery production chain was estimated. It is expected that approximately 90% of batteries in 2030 will be NMC (Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide) type, with a tendency to lower cobalt levels due to ethical and commercial issues for their production. Electric cars are not yet sustainable, so before the mass adoption, there is a need to find ways to recycle batteries, and the power grid needs to shift to cleaner sources of power generation.",SAE Technical Papers
Mesoporous Niobium Nitride Nanowires Encapsulated in Carbon for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© The shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is a fundamental problem restricting the commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries. A polar conductive substrate serving as the sulfur positive host is proven to be an excellent strategy for the efficient immobilization and rapid conversion of LiPSs. Herein, a heterostructure material of niobium nitride nanowires encapsulated in carbon (NbN-NW@C) as a positive host for the sulfur cathode was designed and investigated. First-principles calculation confirms the existence of a strong chemical interaction between NbN-NW and LiPSs, which catalytically promotes the mutual conversion of LiPSs and insoluble Li2S/Li2S2, thus enhancing the redox reaction kinetics. The carbon layer with an adjustable thickness effectively improves the adsorption capacity of the host for LiPSs, and N2 adsorption-desorption shows that the maximum specific surface area of NbN-NW@C-800 is 81.0 m2 g-1. Besides, the metallic property of NbN-NW facilitates electron transmission and improves sulfur utilization. Benefiting from the rational design of the electrode structure, the cathode exhibits excellent cycle stability (the capacity retention is 81.8% after 100 cycles) and rate properties (783 mAh g-1 at 1 C).",ACS Applied Nano Materials
Addressing the Low Solubility of a Solid Electrolyte Interphase Stabilizer in an Electrolyte by Composite Battery Anode Design,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Metallic sodium (Na) has been regarded as one of the most attractive anodes for Na-based rechargeable batteries due to its high specific capacity, low working potential, and high natural abundance. However, several important issues hinder the practical application of the metallic Na anode, including its high reactivity with electrolytes, uncontrolled dendrite growth, and poor processability. Metal nitrates are common electrolyte additives used to stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Na anodes, though they typically suffer from poor solubility in electrolyte solvents. To address these issues, a Na/NaNO3 composite foil electrode was fabricated through a mechanical kneading approach, which featured uniform embedment of NaNO3 in a metallic Na matrix. During the battery cycling, NaNO3 was reduced by metallic Na sustainably, which addressed the issue of low solubility of an SEI stabilizer. Due to the supplemental effect of NaNO3, a stable SEI with NaNxOy and Na3N species was produced, which allowed fast ion transport. As a result, stable electrochemical performance for 600 h was achieved for Na/NaNO3||Na/NaNO3 symmetric cells at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2 and an areal capacity of 0.5 mAh cm-2. A Na/NaNO3||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cell with active metallic Na of μ5 mAh cm-2 at the anode showed stable cycling for 180 cycles. In contrast, a Na||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cell only displayed less than 80 cycles under the same conditions. Moreover, the processability of the Na/NaNO3 composite foil was also significantly improved due to the introduction of NaNO3, in contrast to the soft and sticky pure metallic Na. Mechanical kneading of soft alkali metals and their corresponding nitrates provides a new strategy for the utilization of anode stabilizers (besides direct addition into electrolytes) to improve their electrochemical performance.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Photosensitization Dynamics of Stable Copper Nanoclusters inside the Aqueous Core of Reverse Micelles with Different Pool Sizes,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.The perennial problem of instability of fluorescent copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs), stemming principally from aerial oxidation, has prevented their vivid usage in energy harvesting compared to the other metal NCs. However, replacement of the much expensive metal NCs with the cheaper Cu NCs is desirable if the functions are met with. Although thiolate protection of Cu NCs could bring some stability to them, appreciably decentlystable Cu NCs were produced inside the aqueous core of reverse micelles (RMs). However, this recent development has not been further explored on the photosensitization of the Cu NCs inside the RMs and their controlled modulation as energy antenna. Here we have synthesized stable Cu NCs inside the aqueous core of RMs with three different pool sizes and established photoinduced electron transfer (PET) to an electron acceptor. Considering the bulk quencher concentration, it appears that the extent of PET increases with decrease in the size of the aqueous core of RMs. However, calculating the effective concentration of the electron acceptor inside the RMs and considering the polarity of the microheterogeneous systems, it becomes clear that the extent of PET actually decreases with decrease in the size of the aqueous pool (w0, i.e., [H2O]/[AOT]) = 5-20) in the RMs. This proof of concept and the results are promising toward applications in PET-driven phenomena such as solar cells or batteries.",Langmuir
Enabling a Stable Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Battery Cathode by Building Heterostructures in Multichannel Carbon Fibers,"© Roomerature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries are widely considered as one of the alternative energy-storage systems with low cost and high energy density. However, the both poor cycle stability and capacity are two critical issues arising from low conversion kinetics and sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) dissolution for sulfur cathodes during the charge/discharge process. Herein, we report a highly stable RT Na-S battery cathode via building heterostructures in multichannel carbon fibers. The TiN-TiO2@MCCFs, fabricated by electrospinning and nitriding techniques, are loaded with the active material S, forming S/TiN-TiO2@MCCFs as the cathode in a RT Na-S battery. At 0.1 A g-1, the cathode produces the capacity of more than 640 mAh g-1 within 100 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. Even at 5 A g-1, the battery still exhibites a capacity of 257.1 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles. Combining structural and electrochemical analyses with the first-principles calculations reveals that the incorporation of the highly electrocatalytic activity of TiN with the powerful chemisorption of TiO2 well stabilizes S and also alleviates the shuttle effects of polysulfides. This work with simple processes and low cost is expected to promote the further development and application of metal-S batteries.",ACS Nano

Recent advances in cathode engineering to enable reversible room-temperature aluminium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.The rigorous requirements, such as high abundance, cost-effectiveness, and increased storage capacities, pose severe challenges to the existing Li-ion batteries' long-term sustainability. Room-temperature aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) chemistry, in particular, is gaining importance due to its high theoretical energy density (1700 W h kg−1). Al-S battery technology is one of the emerging metal-sulfur candidates that can surpass current Li-ion chemistries. When coupled with sulfur, aluminum metal brings a cheap and energy-rich option to existing battery technologies. Owing to the unique virtues of the Al-S battery, it has garnered increasing interest among scientific communities. Al-S chemistry has been investigated for quite some time, yet the cell performance remained in its infancy, which poses a challenge to this technology's viability. Besides stabilizing the Al metal anode, the most important challenge in the practical development of Al-S batteries is the development of a suitable sulfur cathode material. Owing to the complexity of this multivalent system, numerous factors have been taken into account, but the best sulfur cathode is yet to be identified. A detailed exploration of sulfur cathodes and their implications on the battery performance are discussed in this mini-review article. We present a detailed picture of cathode materials that may serve as the reference guide for developing more practical cathode materials. Also, fundamental principles and challenges encountered in the development of the sulfur cathodes are highlighted. Through the knowledge disseminated in this mini-review, the development in the multivalent post-Li-ion battery can be accelerated.

One-Step Solvothermal Route to Sn4P3-Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanohybrids as Cycle-Stable Anode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Sn4P3, owing to its high theoretical volumetric capacity, good electrical conductivity, and relatively appropriate potential plateau, has been recognized as an ideal anode for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). However, the current synthetic routes for Sn4P3-based nanohybrids typically involve foreign-template-based multistep procedures, limiting their large-scale production and applications in NIBs. Using commercial red phosphorus as the phosphorus source and nontoxic ethanolamine as the solvent, we herein report a facile and scalable solvothermal protocol for the one-step preparation of Sn4P3-reduced oxide graphene (denoted as Sn4P3-rGO) hybrid materials. Benefiting from the novel strategy and elaborate design, ultrasmall Sn4P3 nanoparticles (2.7 nm on average) are homogeneously anchored onto rGO. The high conductivity of the rGO network and the short electron/ion diffusion path of ultrasmall Sn4P3 nanoparticles give the Sn4P3-rGO hybrid high capacities and stable long-term cyclability. Specifically, the optimized Sn4P3-rGO hybrid displays a remarkable reversible capacity of 663.5 mA h g-1 at a current density of 200 mA g-1, ultralong-term cycle life (301 mA h g-1 after 2500 cycles at a high current density of 2000 mA g-1), and excellent rate capability, presenting itself as a highly promising anode material for NIBs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Multi-step Controllable Catalysis Method for the Defense of Sodium Polysulfide Dissolution in Room-Temperature Na-S Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature (RT) sodium-sulfur batteries hold great promise for the development of efficient, low-cost, and environmentally friendly energy storage systems. Nevertheless, the dissolution of long-chain polysulfides is a huge obstacle. In this work, a composite cathode which integrates Ni/Co bimetal nanoparticles as the catalyst and carbon spheres with abundant channels as the host is prepared for RT Na-S batteries. Moreover, a valuable strategy to reduce the dissolution of polysulfides by accurately regulating the two-step reaction kinetics of polysulfide transformation (from Na2S to long-chain polysulfides and then from polysulfides to sulfur) is presented. Through adjusting the ratio of Ni and Co, the optimal cathode with a Ni/Co ratio of 1:2 can retard the first conversion of Na2S to polysulfides and simultaneously accelerate the subsequent transformation of polysulfides to sulfur. In this case, the soluble polysulfides can immediately transform to solid sulfur as soon as it appears, thus avoiding the shuttle of polysulfides. The galvanostatic intermittent titration method and in situ Raman are employed to supervise the transformation of polysulfides during the discharge/charge process. As a result, the composite shows excellent performance as the cathode of RT liquid/quasi-solid-state Na-S batteries in terms of specific capacities, rate capability, and cycle stability.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
A study of low-temperature solid-state supercapacitors based on Al-ion conducting polymer electrolyte and graphene electrodes,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Gel electrolytes currently draw considerable interest for flexible supercapacitors. Conventional hydrogel electrolytes find limited suitability at low/high temperatures as they contain immense water. This hinders their application in supercapacitors under a harsh environment. Herein, a novel gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) membrane based on the PVdF-HFP/EMITf/Al(Tf)3 system is prepared. The optimized GPE membrane exhibits a high ionic conductivity of ~1.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room-temperature with a high value of ~0.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 retained at a freezing temperature of −20 °C. The prepared GPE membrane also offers a wide electrochemical stability window (~5.6–4.2 V) in the temperature range of −20 to 60 °C. The supercapacitor cells designed with GPE membrane and graphene nano-platelet electrode display excellent capacitive performance (323.9 F g−1 at 2 V) and cycling stability (over 50000 cycles) at room-temperature. At −20 °C, the supercapacitor cells still maintain promising capacitive performance and outstanding cycling stability.

Zinc manganate/manganic oxide bi-component nanorod as excellent cathode for zinc-ion battery,"© 2020Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have been receiving much attention because they are cheap, safe, and environment-friendly. However, their application is bottlenecked by limitation in high-capacity cathode and types of materials to achieve satisfactory cyclability. Therefore, developing new cathode materials for rechargeable zinc-ion batteries is essential. Herein, we report promising ZIBs based on metal-organic framework-derived 2-methylimidazole zinc salt (ZIF-8)/Mn2O3 nanocomposites as cathode and zinc as the anode. ZnMn2O4/Mn2O3 bi-component nanorods were synthesized by annealing ZIF-8/MnO2 precursors, which showed a reversible discharge capacity of 230 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1 after 120 cycles and a high capacity of 80 mAh g–1 at a large current density of 1000 mA g–1. The superior zinc storage performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between ZnMn2O4 and Mn2O3.",Scripta Materialia
Revealing the unique process of alloying reaction in Ni-Co-Sb/C nanosphere anode for high-performance lithium storage,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.The strategy of “template sacrifice method” was proposed to synthesize well-defined NiSb/CoSb nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanosphere (Ni-Co-Sb/C, ~560 nm) by calcination treatment of the Ni-Co-MOF (metal-organic framework) precursor. Due to the structural controllability of MOF precursor and Ni/Co bimetallic synergy, the fabricated Ni-Co-Sb/C demonstrates a high surface area (88 m2 g−1) and superior ion conductivity, thus an excellent electrochemical performance as has been achieved as lithium ion battery (LIB) anode. A reversible discharge specific capacity as high as 495.1 mAh g−1 has been stably delivered after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 1.0 A g−1. In addition, the charge transfer impedance of Ni-Co-Sb/C electrode is as low as 67.6 Ω in the 30th cycle at 0.1 A g−1 and the pseudocapacitive contribution is as high as 73.8% at 0.5 mV s−1. The alloying mechanism of Ni-Co-Sb/C has been verified by in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), which enables a high lithium storage capacity. Moreover, the full-cell assembled with LiCoO2 as cathode exhibits a steady discharge specific capacity of 354.0 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 even after 100 cycles.

Efficient separators with fast Li-ion transfer and high polysulfide entrapment for superior lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.A facile and general vacuum-filtration approach is employed to coat hierarchical metal–organic framework-derived Co-C polyhedrons onto traditional separators for lithium − sulfur batteries. The resultant condensed separators with Co-C coating (Co-C@separator) can effectively decrease the pore size of commercial separators from 200 to 300 nm to 2.2–10 nm. The decreased pore sizes block the shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) through the separator, thus solving the annoying ‘shuttle effect’ via physical confinement. Furthermore, the embedded Co nano-nodes in Co-C polyhedrons are capable of capturing LiPSs via strong chemical adsorption of soluble LiPSs. Through this advantage combined with the rapid Li-ion transport through the intragranular pores between the Co-C polyhedrons, a sulfur-rich cathode (72% sulfur) has achieved outstanding performance when using the Co-C@separator, delivering decent cycling stability (675 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 0.1 A g−1) and high rate performance (401 mAh g−1 after 600 cycles at 1.0 A g−1). This approach serves as a facile strategy for remedying the shuttle phenomenon in lithium-sulfur batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal

However, Li-dendrite penetration and unstable interface between solid-state electrolyte and Li-metal incumber their application. Herein, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) added Li0.35La0.55TiO3-Poly (ethylene oxide) (LLTO-(PEO-FEC)) composite solid-state electrolytes (CSSEs) are fabricated to address the bottlenecks. The CSSE possesses high Li+ conductivity of 1.13 × 10−4 S·cm−1 vs low electronic conductivity of 1.68 × 10−9 S·cm−1 at 25 °C, presents a wide electrochemical window of 5.2 V (vs. Li+/Li), and shows much more stable lithium deposition at current density of 0.2 mA·cm−2 for 800 h. FEC is driven by Li+ to the damaged interface to form new LiF-rich interface layer, which enables the self-healing of Li-metal and CSSE interface and enhances the electrochemical stability of CSSEs against Li-metal. Li| (LLTO-(PEO-FEC)) |LiFePO4 cell presents discharge capability of about 115 mAh·g−1 after 100 cycles at 50 °C. This work reveals the mechanism of dendrite-free Li deposition via interface self-healing process under the effect of FEC–Li+ coordination and provides a promising way to prepare the high performances composite solid-state electrolytes and to fabricate the dendrite-free all-solid-state lithium battery.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Semi-interpenetrating gel polymer electrolyte based on PVDF-HFP for lithium ion batteries,"© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP)-based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is considered one of the promising candidate electrolytes in the polymer lithium ion battery (LIB) because of its free standing, shape versatility, security, flexibility, lightweight, reliability, and so on. However, the pristine PVDF-HFP GPE cannot still meet the requirement of large-scale LIBs and other electrochemical devices due to its relatively low ionic conductivity and deterioration of mechanical strength caused by the incorporation of organic liquid electrolyte into the polymer matrix as well as high cost. In order to overcome above deficiencies of PVDF-HFP based GPE, ultraviolet (UV)-curable semi-interpenetrating polymer network is designed and synthesized through UV-irradiation technique, and the as-prepared semi-interpenetrating matrix is constituted by pentaerythritol tetracrylate polymer network and PVDF-HFP. The ionic conductivity of the optimized GPE is as high as 5 × 10−4 S/cm and electrochemical window is up to 4.8 V at room temperature. Especially, the LIB prepared by GPE shows the high initial discharge specific capacity of 151 mAh/g at 0.5 C and good rate capability. Therefore, the semi-interpenetrating GPE based on PVDF-HFP exhibits a promising prospect for the application of rechargeable LIBs.",Journal of Applied Polymer Science
Tight bonding and high-efficiency utilization of S-S moieties to enable ultra-stable and high-capacity alkali-metal conversion batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Chalcogenide cathodes with high theoretical energy densities are attracting great attention for replacing conventional intercalation cathodes in the energy storage field. However, the difficulties of spatial confinement and catalytic activation of S-S moieties retard their practical application. Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve tight bonding and high-efficiency utilization of S-S moieties by thermal sulfuration of polydopamine (PDA) coated iron difluoride. The resultant dual active-phase (FeS2@S) cathode with a fluorinated surface and cross-linked carbon network enables the preservation and rational distribution of the sulfur molecule interlayer sandwiched between the FeS2core andin situderived carbon shell. The in-built mixed conductive (catalytic) network in interconnected FeS2@S grains enables the achievement of ultra-stable and high-capacity (up to 1000 mA h g−1) alkali-metal conversion batteries. Superior capacity retention is achievable,e.g.800 mA h g−1after 700 cycles for Li-storage and 370 mA h g−1after 1000 cycles for Na-storage even at a high rate of 1C, corresponding to cathode energy densities as high as 1200 and 480 W h kg−1, respectively.

Research progress toward room temperature sodium sulfur batteries: A review,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Lithium metal batteries have achieved large-scale application, but still have limitations such as poor safety performance and high cost, and limited lithium resources limit the production of lithium batteries. The construction of these devices is also hampered by limited lithium supplies. Therefore, it is particularly important to find alternative metals for lithium replacement. Sodium has the properties of rich in content, low cost and ability to provide high voltage, which makes it an ideal substitute for lithium. Sulfur-based materials have attributes of high energy density, high theoretical specific capacity and are easily oxidized. They may be used as cathodes matched with sodium anodes to form a sodium-sulfur battery. Traditional sodium-sulfur batteries are used at a temperature of about 300◦ C. In order to solve problems associated with flammability, explosiveness and energy loss caused by high-temperature use conditions, most research is now focused on the development of room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. Regardless of safety performance or energy storage performance, room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries have great potential as next-generation secondary batteries. This article summarizes the working principle and existing problems for room temperature sodium-sulfur battery, and summarizes the methods necessary to solve key scientific problems to improve the comprehensive energy storage performance of sodium-sulfur battery from four aspects: cathode, anode, electrolyte and separator.",Molecules

Lithium-sulfur batteries employing hybrid-electrolyte structure with Li7La3Zr2O12 at middle operating temperature: Effect of li salts concentration on electrochemical performance,"© The Author(s) 2020.All solid state Lithium-Sulfur batteries can effectively solve the problem of the conventional Li-S batteries with a liquid electrolyte. However, they still do not achieve sufficient cycle stability and rate capability because of high interfacial resistance between the electrode and the solid electrolyte. Hybrid-electrolyte structure using a liquid electrolyte and a solid electrolyte can efficiency solve the interfacial problem. Here, we demonstrate the effect of Li salt concentration in the liquid electrolyte between the sulfur cathode and the solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZ) on the electrochemical properties in Lithium-Sulfur batteries employing hybrid-electrolyte structure. Furthermore, the interfacial reactivity between the liquid electrolyte and LLZ is investigated. With increasing Li salt concentration, the electrochemical performances including the utilization of sulfur, the cycle stability and coulombic efficiency are improved because the dissolution of lithium polysulfides during cycle into the liquid electrolyte at cathode side is inhibited. The interfacial layer is formed on LLZ surface during discharge-charge cycle by a contact of the liquid electrolyte with LLZ, leading to increasing the interfacial resistance. We believe that this study helps to improve the electrochemical properties of Lithium-Sulfur batteries with hybrid electrolyte concepts.",Electrochemistry
Single-Atom Catalysts for Improved Cathode Performance in Na-S Batteries: A Density Functional Theory (DFT) Study,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The room-temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries have attracted remarkable attention because of their promise to deliver high-capacity and low-cost earth-abundant sodium and sulfur. However, the practical development of Na-S batteries is hindered due to multiple challenges, including rapid capacity fading stems from the dissolution of intermediate sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn) and slow kinetics of electrochemical conversion reactions. In this study, we introduced novel transition-metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) to impede the dissolution of higher-order Na2Sn and improve otherwise sluggish kinetics of short-chain polysulfides. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to elucidate the detailed interactions of the polysulfides on the SACs. The pristine and nitrogen-doped graphenes are also considered and found to provide ineffective anchoring for trapping polysulfides. However, the SACs embedded via monodispersed transition-metal atoms in NG (TM-NG where TM = Cr, Fe, and Co) exhibit adequate binding strength toward Na2Sn species. The calculated adsorption energies of soluble Na2Sn on SACs are superior compared to that of commonly used ether-type electrolyte solvents; thus, the SACs are predicted to serve as effective immobilizers for soluble Na2Sn to prevent shuttling. The enhanced binding strength for TM-doped substrates arises from the strong TM-S covalent interactions. The density of state (DOS) calculations reveal that both the pristine and polysulfide adsorbed TM-NG exhibits metallic behavior and illustrate the mechanisms of stronger polysulfide interactions originated from the hybridization of TM-3d and S-2p orbitals. Furthermore, the electron-deficient SACs are found to substantially reduce the Na2S decomposition barrier, which demonstrates effective electrocatalysis in favor of complete reversible conversion of polysulfides. Overall, the effectiveness of the SACs on preventing shuttle effect and improving the kinetics of electrocatalytic conversion of polysulfides unraveled in this study will lead to a paradigm shift in developing advanced Na-S batteries with highly efficient electrocatalysts for Na2Sn conversion.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C

Realizing Ultralong-Term Cyclicability of 5 Volt-Cathode-Material Graphite Flakes by Uniformly Comodified TiO2/Carbon Layer Inducing Stable Cathode-Electrolyte Interphase,"© A common issue the high-voltage cathode materials of secondary batteries suffered from is oxidative electrolyte decomposition inducing rapid capacity fading with discharge/charge cycling. Herein, a highly efficient strategy realizing stable cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) and ultralong-term cyclicability of 5 volt-cathode-material graphite flakes (GFs) for dual-ion batteries is demonstrated. The TiO2/carbon-comodified GF (TO/GF) cathode material with uniform distribution and tight bonding of the nanosized TiO2/carbon layer on the GF surface is synthesized, in which the GF surface is partitioned into nanodomains by the uniformly distributed TiO2 nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the amorphous carbon layer acts as a gummed tape bonding tightly the TiO2 nanoparticles on the graphite flake surface. Serial electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and structural/chemical analyses demonstrate that these unique structural characteristics of the TiO2/carbon comodification endow the TO/GF cathode material with a stable CEI layer coupled with much reduced electrolyte decomposition. Consequently, extremely high cyclicability of 10,000 stable discharge/charge cycles with an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.0021% for anion PF6- storage is realized. This efficient strategy has a potential to be extended to other high-voltage cathode materials and further scaled to the industrial level.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

"Electrochemistry of the NaI-AlBr3Molten Salt System: A Redox-Active, Low-Temperature Molten Salt Electrolyte","© 2021 The Author(s). Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.NaI-AlBr3 is a very appealing low melting temperature (<100 C), salt system for use as an electrochemically-active electrolyte. This system was investigated for its electrochemical and physical properties with focus to energy storage considerations. A simple phase diagram was generated; at >100 C, lower NaI concentrations had two partially miscible liquid phases, while higher NaI concentrations had solid particles. Considering the fully molten regime, electrical conductivities were evaluated over 5-25 mol% NaI and 110 C-140 C. Conductivities of 6.8-38.9 mS cm-1 were observed, increasing with temperature and NaI concentration. Effective diffusion coefficients of the I-/I3- redox species were found to decrease with both increasing NaI concentration and increasing applied potential. Regardless, oxidation current density at 3.6 V vs Na/Na+ was observed to increase with increasing NaI concentration over 5-25 mol%. Finally, the critical interface between the molten salt electrolyte and electrode materials was found to significantly affect reaction kinetics. When carbon was used instead of tungsten, an adsorbed species, most likely I2, blocked surface sites and significantly decreased current densities at high potentials. This study shows the NaI-AlBr3 system offers an attractive, low-temperature molten salt electrolyte that could be useful to many applied systems, though composition and electrode material must be considered.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society

Optimisation of sodium-based energy storage cells using pre-sodiation: A perspective on the emerging field,"© 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Rechargeable sodium-based energy storage cells (sodium-ion batteries, sodium-based dual-ion batteries and sodium-ion capacitors) are currently enjoying enormous attention from the research community due to their promise to replace or complement lithium-ion cells in multiple applications. In all of these emerging sodium-based systems, their performances are worsened by a range of undesired complications, including insufficient initial content of sodium ions in a cell, poor initial coulombic efficiencies of electrode materials, loss of sodium ions during long-term cycling, and the lack of practical possibility to optimise potential ranges in negative and positive electrodes. Pre-sodiation has emerged as an appealing technique to alleviate these problems and, therefore, to increase the practical energy densities of these devices. Nevertheless, the concept of pre-sodiation appears to be under-appreciated within the community, despite the fact that parallel methods of pre-lithiation find more and more uses in the established lithium-based energy storage cells. The intent of this timely perspective is to educate the community on the important benefits of pre-sodiation for a broad range of sodium-based energy storage cells and provide an up-to-date overview of this emerging field. A detailed summary of various situations where pre-sodiation is needed is provided, followed by the critical analysis of electrochemical and chemical techniques used for this purpose. An emphasis is made on the commercialisation potential of the optimal pre-sodiation procedures, and suggestions are provided for the areas of future advancement in the field. This perspective provides important insights of a broad interest to a multidisciplinary community of energy scientists, materials chemists and engineers working at the interface of new energy storage chemistries, device engineering and relevant materials science.",Energy and Environmental Science

Efficient Reversible Conversion between MoS2 and Mo/Na2S Enabled by Graphene-Supported Single Atom Catalysts,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) based on conversion-type metal sulfide (MS) anodes have attracted extraordinary attention due to relatively high capacity and intrinsic safety. The highly reversible conversion of M/Na2S to pristine MS in charge plays a vital role with regard to the electrochemical performance. Here, taking conventional MoS2 as an example, guided by theoretical simulations, a catalyst of iron single atoms on nitrogen-doped graphene (SAFe@NG) is selected and first used as a substrate to facilitate the reaction kinetics of MoS2 in the discharging process. In the following charging process, using a combination of spectroscopy and microscopy, it is demonstrated that the SAFe@NG catalyst enables an efficient reversible conversion reaction of Mo/Na2S→NaMoS2→MoS2. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal that the reversible conversion mechanism shows favorable formation energy barrier and reaction kinetics, in which SAFe@NG with the Fe–N4 coordination center facilitates the uniform dispersion of Na2S/Mo and the decomposition of Na2S and NaMoS2. Therefore, efficient reversible conversion reaction MoS2↔NaMoS2↔Mo/Na2S is enabled by the SAFe@NG catalyst.

To do that, a new sulfur-graphene nanochemistry based on a reductive sulfur solution and oxidative sulfonated-graphene dispersion is developed for the first time. With only the help of mechanical mixing, sulfur particles are successfully synthesized in situ and encapsulated into reaction-induced self-assembled sulfonated-graphene nanocages. These unique nanocages not only provide accommodation of the big volume changes in the active materials, but also exhibit robust polysulfide trapping capability due to the synergistic effects from physical blocking and strong chemical absorption. As a result, the resultant sulfur cathodes deliver superior electrochemical performance and have shown an extremely slow capacity decay of 0.019% per cycle at 0.5 C for over 2000 cycles. This study introduces a new self-caging nanochemistry for scalable synthesis of functional nanocages with significant applications beyond lithium-sulfur batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
"Synthesis Strategies, Catalytic Applications, and Performance Regulation of Single-Atom Catalysts","© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe recent dramatic increase in research on isolated metal atoms has received extensive scientific interest in the new frontier of single-atom catalysis. As newly advanced materials in catalysis, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have received enormous interest from the perspectives of both scientific research and industrial applications due to their remarkable activity. In addition, other catalytic properties of single metal atoms, including stability and selectivity, can be further improved by tuning their electronic/geometric structures and modulating the metal–support interactions. SACs usually consist of dispersed atoms and appropriate support materials, which are employed to anchor, confine, and/or coordinate with isolated metal atoms. Therefore, the nature of single metal sites allows acquiring a maximum atom utilization approaching 100%, which is of significance, particularly for the development of noble-metal-based catalysts. In order to systematically understand the structure–property relationships and the underlying catalytic mechanisms relationship of SACs, the representative scientific research efforts in their synthesis strategies, catalytic applications, and performance regulation are discussed here. Typical single-atom catalysis processes and the corresponding mechanisms in electrochemistry, photochemistry, organic synthesis, and biomedicine are also summarized.

Enhanced processability and electrochemical cyclability of metallic sodium at elevated temperature using sodium alloy composite,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Na metal batteries have attracted great attention owing to their considerable energy density, abundance of Na resources, and potentially low cost. However, Na metal anode suffers from poor processability and high reactivity, which inhibit its practical applications. Herein, we introduce a cross-linked sodium-tin alloy (Na15Sn4) network host for metallic Na and fabricated a Na15Sn4/Na composite foil using a simple cold calendaring approach via spontaneous reaction between metallic Na and metallic Sn, which markedly mitigated the above-mentioned challenges of Na metal anode. Due to its unique structure, the as-fabricated Na15Sn4/Na composite exhibited exceptional processability in contrast to the soft and sticky pure metallic Na, and can be easily fabricated into foils with small thickness (e.g., 100 μm). Na15Sn4/Na||Na15Sn4/Na symmetric cell exhibited stable electrochemical stripping/plating cycling for 100 cycles with constant overpotential of less than 15 mV at 1 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2 at 60°C. Even at harsh 90°C, the symmetric cell showed stable cycling with a low overpotential of around 3 mV at 1 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2. Furthermore, Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 (NCFMO)||Na15Sn4/Na cell demonstrated high rate capability (98 mAh g−1 at 2 C) and cyclability (88% capacity retention for 100 cycles) in comparison to the counterpart with pure Na metal anode (92 mAh g−1 at 2 C, 80% capacity retention for 100 cycles).

Recent Tactics and Advances in the Application of Metal Sulfides as High-Performance Anode Materials for Rechargeable Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe successful development of post-lithium technologies depends on two key elements: performance and economy. Because sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) can potentially satisfy both requirements, they are widely considered the most promising replacement for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the similarity between the electrochemical processes and the abundance of sodium-based resources. Among various SIB anode materials, metal sulfides are most extensively studied as materials for high-performance electrodes due to the versatility of their synthesis procedure, utilization potential, and high sodiation capacity. Herein, some of the most effective strategies aimed at effectively alleviating the performance shortcomings of these materials from the materials engineering/design perspective are summarized. In terms of facilitating ion transport in SIBs, which represents one of the most critical aspects of their performance, a specific family of strategies related to a particular operational mechanism is considered rather than categorizing based-on individual sulfide materials. In the foreseeable future, the development of highly functional SIBs electrode materials and utilization of metal sulfides will become highly relevant due to their stability and performance characteristics. Therefore, it is anticipated that this review will guide further research and facilitate the realization of various applications of sulfide-based high-performance rechargeable batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
Non-Flammable Liquid and Quasi-Solid Electrolytes toward Highly-Safe Alkali Metal-Based Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHRechargeable alkali metal (i.e., lithium, sodium, potassium)-based batteries are considered as vital energy storage technologies in modern society. However, the traditional liquid electrolytes applied in alkali metal-based batteries mainly consist of thermally unstable salts and highly flammable organic solvents, which trigger numerous accidents related to fire, explosion, and leakage of toxic chemicals. Therefore, exploring non-flammable electrolytes is of paramount importance for achieving safe batteries. Although replacing traditional liquid electrolytes with all-solid-state electrolytes is the ultimate way to solve the above safety issues, developing non-flammable liquid electrolytes can more directly fulfill the current needs considering the low ionic conductivities and inferior interfacial properties of existing all-solid-state electrolytes. Moreover, the electrolyte leakage concern can be further resolved by gelling non-flammable liquid electrolytes to obtain quasi-solid electrolytes. Herein, a comprehensive review of the latest progress in emerging non-flammable liquid electrolytes, including non-flammable organic liquid electrolytes, aqueous electrolytes, and deep eutectic solvent-based electrolytes is provided, and systematically introduce their flame-retardant mechanisms and electrochemical behaviors in alkali metal-based batteries. Then, the gelation techniques for preparing quasi-solid electrolytes are also summarized. Finally, the remaining challenges and future perspectives are presented.

However, the inferior transformation efficiencies during phase transition limit its further application. Herein, a 3D spongy VO2-graphene (VO2-rG) precursor has been designed for achieving the ultra-efficient in-situ self-transformation process from VO2-rG into multifaceted V2O5·nH2O-graphene composite (VOH-rG). Benefiting from the highly conductive heterointerfaces, rich reaction sites and numerous ions diffusion channels of VO2-rG, almost 100% VO2 nanobelts are converted into VOH during the first charging with few side reactions, indicating a highly efficient transformation kinetics. This strategy enables structural modulation from micro-nano level to molecular level by integrating pre-inserted H2O molecules and constructing 3D porous heterogeneous architecture into the VOH-rG cathode simultaneously, leading to fast and enduring Zn2+ (de)intercalation kinetics. Consequently, the VOH-rG cathode exhibits high capacity of 466 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, superior rate performance (190 mA h g−1 even at 20 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability with 100% capacity retention over 5000 cycles. Moreover, the assembled VOH-rG//Zn flexible quasi-solid-state batteries also present impressive performance.

Understanding the interaction between heteroatom-doped carbon matrix and Sb2S3 for efficient sodium-ion battery anodes,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Increasing the electrochemical performance of electrode materials in sodium ion batteries (NIBs) remains a major challenge. Here, a combined experimental and theoretical investigation on the modification induced by Sb2S3 embedded in a heteroatom-doped 3D carbon matrix (CM) for efficient anodes in NIBs is presented. The structural and chemical characterization demonstrates the successful doping of 3D CM with S and Sb atoms. When evaluated as anode materials for NIBs, the heteroatom-doped nanocomposites delivered a better cycling stability and superior rate capability than those of undoped Sb2S3/CM anodes. First principle calculations were used at the Density Functional Theory level to systematically study the Sb2S3/CM and Sb2S3/heteroatom doped-CM composites, as NIBs anodes. Doping the carbon substrate by heteroatoms improved the adsorption of Sb2S3 on the matrix and allowed for ionic/covalent attraction with the Sb2S3 nanoparticle, respectively. Such results could be used to model the stabilty of the composite architectures observed in the experiment, for superior cycling stability.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Nevertheless, the intrinsic properties of the large ion radius (Na+ 1.02 Å vs Li+ 0.76 Å) and positive reduction potential (Na/Na+ −2.71 V vs Li/Li+ −3.04 V) may impede ion diffusion, thus causing serious volume expansion, resulting in poor cycling stability.

Synergistic mediation of polysulfide immobilization and conversion by a catalytic and dual-adsorptive system for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Although various inorganic particles have been confirmed as effective trappers to restrict the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSB), the further reduction of LiPSs is impeded due to their low conductivity. This process results in sluggish redox kinetics at the interface of cathode/electrolyte and escaped LiPSs to electrolytes during long-term cycling. Herein, by advantageous functional integration of immobilization and conversion capability for LiPSs, a 3D aerogel with the composition of Co@CoO@N-doped carbon@graphene (Co@CoO@N-C/rGO) is designed and prepared. The dual-shells of N-C and polar CoO enable the strong chemical adsorption towards LiPSs through pyridinic – N-Li-bond and Co···S coordination, respectively. And the conductive Co core acts as a “scissor”, which catalyzes the transformation of adsorbed LiPSs into low-order ones, thus accelerating the kinetics of the liquid–solid nucleation and growth of Li2S. Moreover, the matrix of rGO serves as electrical networks, significantly promoting the transfer of electrons to the redox-active sites. Based on these synergetic effects, the LSB using Co@CoO@N-C/rGO modified separators exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance. For example, even at a rate of 1C, the cell still delivers a stable capacity of 555.4 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles for a pure sulfur electrode. Moreover, the relevant kinetic mechanisms including in situ Raman test are expounded in detail.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Enabling high-performance room-temperature sodium/sulfur batteries with few-layer 2H-MoSe2embellished nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres as polysulfide barriers,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Room-temperature sodium/sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries are of considerable interest for next-generation energy storage systems because of their earth-abundant electrode materials, low cost, and high energy density. However, the widespread application of RT-Na/S batteries is severely hindered by the dissolution, shuttling, and sluggish kinetics conversion of sodium polysulfides (SPSs) during electrochemical processes. Herein, we prepare a powerful functional separator to suppress the shuttle effect by directly coating 2H-MoSe2/nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres/graphene oxide (2H-MoSe2/N-HCS/GO) onto a standard glass fiber separator. The rational design of the functional separator effectively suppresses the migration of SPSs and promotes the conversion reactions of SPSs. Meanwhile, N-HCS decorated with few-layer 2H-MoSe2nanoflakes is used as the sulfur host. As verified by a series of density functional theory calculations and experimental characterization, a RT-Na/S battery with a functional separator and a high sulfur content of 71.4 wt% delivers a high discharge capacity of 787 mA h g−1at 0.1C after 100 cycles and exhibits outstanding long-term cycling stability (484 mA h g−1at 0.5C after 500 cycles), with a low capacity fading rate of 0.077% per cycle. This study demonstrates an effective strategy to develop functional separators for shuttle suppression and provides a promising path for high-performance RT-Na/S batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Sodium-Sulfur Batteries Enabled by a Protected Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Solid Electrolyte,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Sodium-sulfur batteries are promising energy-dense, cost-effective energy storage systems. However, a low-resistance solid electrolyte is necessary to stabilize the sodium anode. While sulfide-based solid electrolytes offer high ionic conductivity, they suffer from chemical reactivity when in contact with sodium metal and are mechanically brittle. This paper implements an in situ cross-linking reaction to embed sodium-ion-conducting sodium thioantimonate in a protective polymer host. The enhanced flexibility enables the formation of a thin but transferable hybrid electrolyte film (30 μm in thickness, 65 ohm cm2 room temperature resistance). Owing to the chemical bonding between sodium thioantimonate and the polymer, the hybrid electrolyte maintains a stable interface with sodium when cycling at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2. The hybrid solid electrolyte protects the sodium metal from corroding with polysulfide-containing liquid electrolyte and enables the stable operation of a sodium-sulfur battery using a nonencapsulated sulfur cathode for 90 cycles.",ACS Energy Letters

The three-dimensional channel skeleton with a macroporous structure of the MMC formed an interwoven carbon network that effectively improved the electrical conductivity and facilitated the transfer of Na+ in the cell by allowing the electrolyte to permeate easily. The micropores (<0.7 nm) of the MMC are the main sulfur host and serve to trap the small sulfur molecules (<0.5 nm) within the pores, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance in room-temperature sodium sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries with a carbonate-based electrolyte. The co-doping of heteroatoms (N, O) in the MMC matrix can create an active site that improves the electrical conductivity and builds an interaction with sulfur species to inhibit polysulfide shuttling. The confinement of sulfur through these physical and chemical mechanisms results in a high initial discharge capacity of 1598 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and a superior capacity retention of 330 mAh g−1 after 510 cycles at 1 C. This study provides an attractive material derived from biomass for low-cost and sustainable RT Na–S batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Crucial Challenges and Recent Optimization Progress of Metal-Sulfur Battery Electrolytes,"© By virtue of environmental friendliness, low cost, and the high theoretical capacity of sulfur (1675 mAh/g), metal-sulfur batteries (MSBs), as promising next-generation rechargeable cells, have attracted ever-increasing attention from both academic and industrial fields. Despite good progress, however, thus far MSBs have been rarely able to bring their energy storage performance up to the needed levels of reliability due to challenging issues such as the shuttle effect of polysulfides, low utilization efficiency of the S, inferior cycling performance, and safety hazards. To tackle this, the rational optimization of the electrolyte, which tremendously affects the cycling stability, rate capability, lifespan, and safety of the investigated batteries, is considered to be one of the crucial directions to improve the performance of MSBs. Herein we outline the challenges and recent optimization progress on electrolytes in MSBs with Li, Na, Mg, Ca, K, and Al as metal anodes. The topics regarding the fundamentals of electrolyte optimization strategies and the possible solution to further performance improvement are highlighted. Finally, a perspective on further electrolyte development is presented. This discussion aims at gaining good insight into the rational design of electrolytes so as to boost the commercial process of MSB development.",Energy and Fuels
Sodium solid electrolytes: Naxaloy bilayer-system based on macroporous bulk material and dense thin-film,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A new preparation concept of a partially porous solid-state bilayer electrolyte (BE) for high-temperature sodium-ion batteries has been developed. The porous layer provides mechanical strength and is infiltrated with liquid and highly conductive NaAlCl4 salt, while the dense layer prevents short circuits. Both layers consist, at least partially, of Na-β-alumina. The BEs are synthesized by a three-step procedure, including a sol-gel synthesis, the preparation of porous, calcined bulk material, and spin coating to deposit a dense layer. A detailed study is carried out to investigate the effect of polyethylene oxide (PEO) concentration on pore size and crystallization of the bulk material. The microstructure and crystallographic composition are verified for all steps via mercury intrusion, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The porous bulk material exhibits an unprecedented open porosity for a NaxAlOy bilayer-system of ≤57% with a pore size of ≈200–300 nm and pore volume of ≤0.3 cm3∙g−1. It contains high shares of crystalline α-Al2O3 and Na-β-alu-mina. The BEs are characterized by impedance spectroscopy, which proved an increase of ionic conductivity with increasing porosity and increasing Na-β-alumina phase content in the bulk ma-terial. Ion conductivity of up to 0.10 S∙cm−1 at 300 °C is achieved.",Materials
"Structural, optical and electrical properties of al+moo3 and au+moo3 thin films prepared by magnetron codeposition","© 2021 by the authors.Structural, optical and electrical properties of Al+MoO3 and Au+MoO3 thin films prepared by simultaneous magnetron sputtering deposition were investigated. The influence of MoO3 sputtering power on the Al and Au nanoparticle formation and spatial distribution was explored. We demonstrated the formation of spatially arranged Au nanoparticles in the MoO3 matrix, while Al incorporates in the MoO3 matrix without nanoparticle formation. The dependence of the Au nanoparticle size and arrangement on the MoO3 sputtering power was established. The Al-based films show a decrease of overall absorption with an Al content increase, while the Au-based films have the opposite trend. The transport properties of the investigated films also are completely different. The resistivity of the Al-based films increases with the Al content, while it decreases with the Au content increase. The reason is a different transport mechanism that occurs in the films due to their different structural properties. The choice of the incorporated material (Al or Au) and its volume percentage in the MoO3 matrix enables the design of materials with desirable optical and electrical characteristics for a variety of applications.",Materials
Engineering nanoreactors for metal-chalcogen batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Metal-chalcogen batteries (MCBs) are promising alternatives to the commonly used lithium-ion batteries, because they can provide remarkable capacities while using cheaper and more versatile electrodes. Nevertheless, the rational design and controllable synthesis of electrode materials is still a great challenge.

"Toward commercial-level mass-loading electrodes for supercapacitors: Opportunities, challenges and perspectives","© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Fast charging/discharging rate and long life span render supercapacitors a potential candidate for the next generation energy supply. Nevertheless, the remaining wide gap between the basic/experimental research and practical requirements acts as the main barrier for further progress. In consequence, devising new techniques and platforms to well match the key and urgent requirements from a commercial/usable standpoint is highly desired. Specifically, although great progress has been made for the configuration of tailor-made electrode materials in terms of methodology and mechanisms, to meet the practical requirement, a bottleneck and urgent issue is to keep a decent performance when increasing the mass loading multi-times to the commercial level. Frustratingly, due to the greatly inhibited and worsened charge storage and ion migration dynamics, it is so challenging to reach this goal and it has confused researchers to a great extent up to now. In this review, we try to illustrate and clarify the involved fundamental principles for commercial-level mass-loading electrodes, including the analysis and evaluation of ion permeation/diffusion, charge transfer and redox reaction dynamics. Subsequently, we summarize and comment on the up-to-date key achievements and progress toward commercial-level mass-loading electrodes, which is divided into six branches: coupling with 3D conductive substrates, creating available pore channels, configuring hierarchical structures, aligning internal constructions by physical force/field, optimizing the properties by hetero-atoms/ions and engineering conductive MOFs. In parallel, some scientific perceptions and impressive concepts to facilitate the reaction dynamics are also highlighted. Moreover, concise outlooks/perspectives are presented here with an expectation to spark new ideas and endeavors for bringing supercapacitors into practical and daily-life applications.",Energy and Environmental Science
Solid-State Electrochemical Synthesis of Silicon Clathrates Using a Sodium-Sulfur Battery Inspired Approach,"© 2021 The Author(s). Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.Clathrates of Tetrel elements (Si, Ge, Sn) have attracted interest for their potential use in batteries and other applications. Sodium-filled silicon clathrates are conventionally synthesized through thermal decomposition of the Zintl precursor Na4Si4, but phase selectivity of the product is often difficult to achieve. Herein, we report the selective formation of the type I clathrate Na8Si46 using electrochemical oxidation at 450 °C and 550 °C. A two-electrode cell design inspired by high-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries is employed, using Na4Si4 as working electrode, Na β″-alumina solid electrolyte, and counter electrode consisting of molten Na or Sn. Galvanostatic intermittent titration is implemented to observe the oxidation characteristics and reveals a relatively constant cell potential under quasi-equilibrium conditions, indicating a two-phase reaction between Na4Si4 and Na8Si46. We further demonstrate that the product selection and morphology can be altered by tuning the reaction temperature and Na vapor pressure. Room temperature lithiation of the synthesized Na8Si46 is evaluated for the first time, showing similar electrochemical characteristics to those in the type II clathrate Na24Si136. The results show that solid-state electrochemical oxidation of Zintl phases at high temperatures can lead to opportunities for more controlled crystal growth and a deeper understanding of the formation processes of intermetallic clathrates.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
A poly(Ethylene oxide)/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide-coated polypropylene membrane for a high-loading lithium–sulfur battery,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In lithium–sulfur cells, the dissolution and relocation of the liquid-state active material (polysulfides) lead to fast capacity fading and low Coulombic efficiency, resulting in poor long-term electrochemical stability. To solve this problem, we synthesize a composite using a gel polymer electrolyte and a separator as a functional membrane, coated with a layer of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). The PEO/LiTFSI-coated polypro-pylene membrane slows the diffusion of polysulfides and stabilizes the liquid-state active material within the cathode region of the cell, while allowing smooth lithium-ion transfer. The lithium-sulfur cells with the developed membrane demonstrate a high charge-storage capacity of 1212 mA∙h g−1, 981 mA∙h g−1, and 637 mA∙h g−1 at high sulfur loadings of 2 mg cm−2, 4 mg cm−2, and 6 mg cm−2, respectively, and maintains a high reversible capacity of 534 mA∙h g−1 after 200 cycles, proving its ability to block the irreversible diffusion of polysulfides and to maintain the stabilized polysulfides as the catholyte for improved electrochemical utilization and stability. As a comparison, reference and control cells fabricated using a PEO-coated polypropylene membrane and a regular separator, respectively, show a poor capacity of 662 mA∙h g−1 and a short cycle life of 50 cycles.",Polymers
A new insight into capacity fading of sulfurized polyacrylonitrile composite in carbonate electrolyte,"© 2021Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (S/PAN) composite shows great potential as a cathode material for lithium sulfur batteries, due to its advantages in cycle performance and carbonate electrolyte compatibility. However, the cell using S/PAN composite as a cathode material exhibits sluggish reaction kinetics due to the low conductivity. Moreover, capacity fading is also found in long-term cycle test and the mechanism is not well studied in previous reports. In this work, a compact composite, S/PAN confined in macro-porous carbon (MaPC), is firstly prepared by using a sulfur copolymer to improve the cycle stability. The cathode shows stable cycle stability during the initial 150 cycles at the current density of 1050 mA gsulfur−1 and the capacity maintained at 806 mAh gsulfur−1. The cycle stability is getting worse during the long-term cycle test. It is found that the capacity fading is highly related to the increasing resistance and the formation of sulfates or sulfate-like components during the repeated cycling process.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
NiCo2O4/CNF Separator Modifiers for Trapping and Catalyzing Polysulfides for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries with High Sulfur Loadings and Lean Electrolytes,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The shuttle effect and sluggish conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) restrict the practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we introduce nickel cobaltite/carbon nanofiber (NiCo2O4/CNF) composites as a chemical trapper and conversion accelerator for LiPSs. The experiment and density functional theory indicate that polar NiCo2O4 can strongly trap polysulfides through Ni-S and Co-S bonds. The CNF network provides structural stability and serves as a second barrier for polysulfides. Systematic studies on the solid(sulfur)-liquid(polysulfides)-solid(sulfide) conversion reactions qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that the well-designed NiCo2O4/CNF interface with strong polysulfides affinity, affluent polar nucleation sites, and fast Li+/e- transport can noteworthily catalyze the liquid-phase conversion of LiPSs and the solid-phase deposition of lithium sulfide (Li2S) and protect the lithium anode as well. Thus, the NiCo2O4/CNF-based batteries can exhibit a high rate capability of 870 mAh g-1 at 5 C and excellent cycling performance evidenced by a capacity retention of 95% after 200 cycles at 0.1 C with a sulfur loading of 6.3 mg cm-2. Further increasing the sulfur loading to 7.9 mg cm-2 and with a lean electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 7.2 μL mgs-1, the Li-S battery can deliver a high areal capacity of 8.1 mAh cm-2.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
Post-lithium-ion battery cell production and its compatibility with lithium-ion cell production infrastructure,"© 2021, Springer Nature Limited.Lithium-ion batteries are currently the most advanced electrochemical energy storage technology due to a favourable balance of performance and cost properties. Driven by forecasted growth of the electric vehicles market, the cell production capacity for this technology is continuously being scaled up. However, the demand for better performance, particularly higher energy densities and/or lower costs, has triggered research into post-lithium-ion technologies such as solid-state lithium metal, lithium–sulfur and lithium–air batteries as well as post-lithium technologies such as sodium-ion batteries. Currently, these technologies are being intensively studied with regard to material chemistry and cell design. In this Review, we expand on the current knowledge in this field. Starting with a market outlook and an analysis of technological differences, we discuss the manufacturing processes of these technologies. For each technology, we describe anode production, cathode production, cell assembly and conditioning. We then evaluate the manufacturing compatibility of each technology with the lithium-ion production infrastructure and discuss the implications for processing costs.",Nature Energy

Boosting Energy Storage via Confining Soluble Redox Species onto Solid–Liquid Interface,"© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHAn upswell in the demand for both high energy density and large power density has triggered extensive research in developing next-generation energy storage systems (ESSs), including redox-enhanced electrochemical capacitors, metal–sulfur (Li-S and Na-S) batteries, and metal–iodine (Li-I2, Na-I2, etc.) batteries, which involve a liquid reaction pathway that decouples the reaction kinetics from the sluggish ion diffusion in the solid phase. Development is plagued at present by the shuttle effects of soluble redox species (SRSs) resulting in poor cycling stability and rapid self-discharge. Based on the shuttle mechanisms of SRSs, it is crucial to build an atomic or molecular relationship between the electrode surface and SRSs, that is, solid–liquid interface. Here, a timely review of current advances towards the confinement of SRSs in ESSs through solid–liquid interfacial manipulation at the atomic/molecular level is presented. Particularly, the immobilization mechanisms of SRSs around electrode materials within a series of successful examples are highlighted. The corresponding promising research avenues and challenges via interfacial manipulations are also outlined. With this work as a background, new insights into promising strategies that effectively confine the SRSs around electrodes are discussed, with the aim to facilitate vertical leaps in the performance of next-generation ESSs.",Advanced Energy Materials

Red Phosphorous-Derived Protective Layers with High Ionic Conductivity and Mechanical Strength on Dendrite-Free Sodium and Potassium Metal Anodes,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHSodium metal anodes are ideal candidates for advanced high energy density Na metal batteries. Nevertheless, the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), the uncontrollable dendrite growth, and low Coulombic efficiency during cycling have prevented their applications. Herein, a high-performance Na anode is achieved by introduction of an ex situ artificial Na3P layer on the surface via a simple red phosphorus pretreatment method. The artificial SEI layer possesses high ionic conductivity and high Young's modulus, which regulates uniform deposition of ions and prevents the dendrite growth. Benefiting from these merits, the Na||Na cells with the protected layers demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance (780 h at 1.0 mA cm–2, 1.0 mAh cm–2). When assembled into a full battery with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, the Na metal battery exhibits a long lifespan of 400 cycles at 15 C and a high rate capacity of ≈53.2 mAh g–1 at 30 C. In addition the red P pretreatment method can be applied to potassium metal anodes. Outstanding performance is also achieved in K||K cells with the formation of a KxPy protecting layer (550 h at 0.5 mA cm–2, 0.5 mAh cm–2). The artificial P-derived protection approach can also be extended to solid-state alkali metal batteries with high power density and energy density.",Advanced Energy Materials
Superior Sodium Metal Anodes Enabled by Sodiophilic Carbonized Coconut Framework with 3D Tubular Structure,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHAlthough extensive efforts have been made to stabilize metal sodium anodes and prevent dendrite formation, it is still difficult to achieve long-term stability at large area capacity and high current density due to a series of complex failure modes, including uneven Na nucleation and subsequent dendrite formation. Herein, an oxygen-containing carbonized coconut framework (O-CCF) with a 3D tubular structure is designed to inhibit dendrite growth. The 3D tubular structure can regulate the uniform distribution of electric field, making Na+ diffuse evenly on the electrode surface. The oxygen functional groups with sodiophilicity contribute to the adsorption of Na+ and reduce the Na nucleation energy on the surface of O-CCF. The interaction of 3D tubular structure and oxygen functional groups enable Na stripping/plating over 10 000 cycles at 50 mA cm−2, as well as cycling stably for 1000 cycles with coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 5 mA cm−2 and high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm−2. As a proof of concept, full cells of O-CCF//Na-Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) and Na-O-CCF//Fe7S8 are assembled and exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance.

A Self-Sodiophilic Carbon Host Promotes the Cyclability of Sodium Anode,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHBenefiting from abundant resource reserves and considerable theoretical capacity, sodium (Na) metal is a strong anode candidate for low-cost, large-scale energy storage applications. However, extensive volume change and mossy/dendritic growth during Na electrodeposition have impeded the practical application of Na metal batteries. Herein, a self-sodiophilic carbon host, lignin-derived carbon nanofiber (LCNF), is reported to accommodate Na metal through an infiltration method. Na metal is completely encapsulated in the 3D space of the LCNF host, where the strong interaction between LCNF and Na metal is mediated by the self-sodiophilic sites. The resulting LCNF@Na electrode delivers good cycling stability with a low voltage hysteresis and a dendrite-free morphology in commercial carbonate-based electrolytes. When interfaced with O3-NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 and P2-Na0.7Ni0.33Mn0.55Fe0.1Ti0.02O2 cathodes in full cell Na metal batteries, the LCNF@Na electrode enables high capacity retentions, long cycle life, and good rate capability. Even in a “lean” Na anode environment, the full cells can still deliver good electrochemical performance. The overall stable battery performance, based on a self-sodiophilic, biomass-derived carbon host, illuminates a promising path towards enabling low-cost Na metal batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
Revealing the Double-Edged Behaviors of Heteroatom Sulfur in Carbonaceous Materials for Balancing K-Storage Capacity and Stability,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHHeteroatoms in the carbon matrix are generally considered as active sites to enhance potassium storage capacity, while their adverse effects on ion batteries remain unclear. Herein, a series of sulfur doped carbon (SCDPx) with adjustable S content and crystallinity are accurately synthesized in the closed autoclave by controlling the ratios of precursors. Electrochemical measurements exhibit that heteroatom sulfur displays double-edged electrochemical activities with a high initial potassium storage capacity but poor cycling stability for carbon anode. Combined with solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), catalytic tests, and various ex-situ characterizations, it is demonstrated that abundant S in the carbon would not only form C-S-C bonds, acting as active sites to reversibly adsorb/desorb potassium ions for high capacity, but also significantly catalyze the reduction and decomposition of the electrolyte including KPF6 and ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC) to form thicker solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and degrade electrolyte, resulting in rapid capacity decay. As a result, the optimized sample (SCDP2) with the appropriate sulfur doping content exhibits the best electrochemical performance with high capacity (688.4 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1), long-term cycling stability (198.4 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1 after 10 000 cycles), and excellent rate capability (238.8 mA h g−1 at 5000 mA g−1).",Advanced Functional Materials

Photopolymerized Gel Electrolyte with Unprecedented Room-Temperature Ionic Conductivity for High-Energy-Density Solid-State Sodium Metal Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHSolid-state sodium metal batteries (SMBs) are highly promising rechargeable batteries owing to the abundance and cost effectiveness of sodium. However, the low room-temperature ionic conductivity and narrow voltage window of solid-state electrolytes seriously inhibit the development of SMBs. Herein, an ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate based quasisolid-state electrolyte (ETPTA–NaClO4–QSSE) is developed by photopolymerization for high-energy-density solid-state SMBs. The ETPTA–NaClO4–QSSE exhibits remarkable room-temperature ionic conductivity of 1.2 mS cm−1, a wide electrochemical window of >4.7 V versus Na+/Na, and excellent flexibility. Owing to outstanding interfacial compatibility between this electrolyte and the electrode, Na metal symmetrical batteries show ultralong cyclability with 1000 h at 0.1 mA cm−2, and ultralow overpotential of 355 mV at 1 mA cm−2, indicative of significant suppression of the Na dendrite growth. Notably, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) full batteries (NVP||ETPTA–NaClO4–QSSE||Na) display unprecedented rate capability, with a recorded capacity of 55 mAh g−1 at 15 C, higher than any achieved so far in solid-state SMBs, and long-term cycling stability at 5 C, offering a capacity retention of 97% after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, NVP||ETPTA–NaClO4–QSSE||Na pouch cells represent excellent flexibility and exceptional safety, demonstrative of wide applicability. Therefore, this work will open new opportunities to develop room-temperature high-energy-density solid-state SMBs.",Advanced Energy Materials
Hierarchical ZnO nanorod arrays grown on copper foam as an advanced three-dimensional skeleton for dendrite-free sodium metal anodes,"© 2020Na metal is regarded as a potential anode material for next-generation Na metal batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and low cost. However, the severe dendrite growth and infinitely volume changes of Na limit its practical applications as an anode material. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) Cu foam skeleton with hierarchical ZnO nanorod arrays (CF@ZnO) was prepared as a stable host for dendrite-free Na metal anodes. Commercially available Cu foam was treated via a simple chemical precipitation method to grow hierarchical ZnO nanorod arrays, exhibiting a 3D porous structure with a cylindrical core-shell skeleton. The highly “sodiophilic” ZnO nanorod arrays provided abundant Na nucleation sites and exhibited low nucleation overpotential, which facilitated the homogeneous nucleation and uniform growth of Na on the electrode. Moreover, the 3D porous core-shell cylindrical structure of the nanorod arrays efficiently reduced the local effective current density, thus suppressing the growth of Na dendrites, as indicated by COMSOL Multiphysics simulations. As a result, the CF@ZnO electrode exhibited dendrite-free morphology during repeated Na plating/striping and excellent cycling stability with very small voltage hysteresis even at high current densities. When paired with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, the CF@ZnO/Na electrode showed significant potential for application in full cells. This study provides a facile approach to design 3D sodiophilic hosts for high-energy-density Na metal batteries.",Nano Energy
"Interface Issues and Challenges in All-Solid-State Batteries: Lithium, Sodium, and Beyond","© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimOwing to the promise of high safety and energy density, all-solid-state batteries are attracting incremental interest as one of the most promising next-generation energy storage systems.

Sb nanosheet modified separator for Li-S batteries with excellent electrochemical performance,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.An air-stable antimony (Sb) nanosheet modified separator (SbNs/separator) has been prepared by coating exfoliated Sb nanosheets (SbNs) successfully onto a pristine separator through a vacuum infiltration method. The as-prepared Li-S batteries using SbNs/separators exhibit much improved electrochemical performance compared to the ones using commercial separators. The coulombic efficiency (CE) of the Li-S battery using the SbNs/separator after the initial cycle is close to 100% at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, and 660 mA h g−1capacity retained after 100 cycles. The rate capability of Li-S battery using SbNs/separator delivers a reversible capacity of 425 mA h g−1when the current density increases to 1 A g−1. The improved electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the following reasons. Firstly, the combination of physical adsorption and chemical bonding between SbNs and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), which efficiently inhibits the shuttle phenomena of LiPSs. Secondly, the good electronic conductivity of SbNs improves the utilization of the adsorbed LiPSs, which benefits the capacity release of active materials. Lastly, the fast conversion kinetics of intermediate LiPSs caused by the catalytic effect from SbNs further suppresses the shuttle effect of LiPSs. The SbNs/separators exhibit a great potential for the future high-performance Li-S batteries.",RSC Advances
Exploring the effect of interlayer distance of expanded graphite for sodium ion storage using first principles calculations,"© the Owner Societies 2021.Expanded graphite (EG) has been shown to be able to store a significant amount of sodium ions. Understanding the alkali metal ion storage in EG is of importance for improving EG electrode performance. In this work, the effect of interlayer distance of pure EG on sodium ion storage was investigated using the density functional theory calculation method. EG structure models with interlayer distances ranging from 3.4 Å to 10.0 Å were simulated. It was found that EG can store a fairly large amount of sodium ions through an intercalation mechanism without any contributions from the co-intercalation mechanism or adsorption mechanism if the interlayer distance is larger than 4.4 Å and smaller than 6.0 Å. It was also found that an interlayer distance of 6.0 Å gives strong binding energy of sodium ions with EG forming thermodynamically stable sodium-graphite intercalation compound (Na-GIC). However, when the interlayer distance becomes larger than 6.0 Å, the binding energy between sodium ions and EG becomes weaker. Computational results have also shown that the enthalpy of formation of the Na-GIC of EG is energetically more favourable when the interlayer distance is increased. An optimald-spacing of EG for sodium ion storage was identified in this work. These findings provide atomistic insights into sodium ion storage in EG, providing guidelines for the design of graphite-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics

The sulfur element with a high specific capacity gives great development space for aluminum-sulfur (Al–S) battery. However, the dissolution of sulfur in electrolyte hinders the application of Al–S battery. Carbon materials with porous structure has larger specific surface area for adsorption of sulfur, and the porous carbon for sulfur cathode provides a certain barrier for the shuttle effect during the charge-discharge process. In this work, hollow carbon synthesized by template method is applied to Al–S batteries. It is found that the cave-like porous carbon material provides space for storing sulfur and polysulfides, alleviating the sulfur shuttle effect in Al–S batteries. The specific capacity of the hollow carbon materials for Al–S batteries is 1027 mAh g−1 at the first cycle and the rechargeable specific capacity achieves 378 mAh g−1 after 28 cycle.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy

They have been employed as electrode components to enhance the redox kinetics and adjust the interactions at the reaction interface, boosting device performance. In this Review, we briefly summarize the related background knowledge, motivation and working principle toward next-generation electrochemical energy storage (or conversion) devices, including fuel cells, Zn-air batteries, Al-air batteries, Li-air batteries, Li-CO2 batteries, Li-S batteries, and Na-S batteries. While pointing out the remaining challenges in each system, we clarify the importance of SACs to solve these development bottlenecks. Then, we further explore the working principle and current progress of SACs in various device systems. Finally, future opportunities and perspectives of SACs in next-generation electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices are discussed.",ACS Nano
Sulfur-Rich Graphene Nanoboxes with Ultra-High Potassiation Capacity at Fast Charge: Storage Mechanisms and Device Performance,"© It is a major challenge to achieve fast charging and high reversible capacity in potassium ion storing carbons. Here, we synthesized sulfur-rich graphene nanoboxes (SGNs) by one-step chemical vapor deposition to deliver exceptional rate and cyclability performance as potassium ion battery and potassium ion capacitor (PIC) anodes. The SGN electrode exhibits a record reversible capacity of 516 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1, record fast charge capacity of 223 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1, and exceptional stability with 89% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. Additionally, the SGN-based PIC displays highly favorable Ragone chart characteristics: 112 Wh kg-1at 505 W kg-1 and 28 Wh kg-1 at 14618 W kg-1 with 92% capacity retention after 6000 cycles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis illustrates a charge storage sequence based primarily on reversible ion binding at the structural-chemical defects in the carbon and the reversible formation of K-S-C and K2S compounds. Transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrates reversible dilation of graphene due to ion intercalation, which is a secondary source of capacity at low voltage. This intercalation mechanism is shown to be stable even at cycle 1000. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique analysis yields diffusion coefficients from 10-10 to 10-12 cm2 s-1, an order of magnitude higher than S-free carbons. The direct electroanalytic/analytic comparison indicates that chemically bound sulfur increases the number of reversible ion bonding sites, promotes reaction-controlled over diffusion-controlled kinetics, and stabilizes the solid electrolyte interphase. It is also demonstrated that the initial Coulombic efficiency can be significantly improved by switching from a standard carbonate-based electrolyte to an ether-based one.",ACS Nano
Influence of the Artificial Nanostructure on the LiF Formation at the Solid-Electrolyte Interphase of Carbon-Based Anodes,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is of crucial importance for the performance of Li-ion batteries. Here, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to study the formation of one of the simplest and early appearing components of the SEI layer, namely, LiF, which is produced by splitting HF impurities. The process is investigated on different models representing the basal and edge-planes of a graphitic anode, and on covalently connected carbon nanotubes and graphene sheets, known as pillared graphene. The results show that 2 Li atoms are required to bind F in the final state in order to make the reaction energetically favorable, or alternatively, a H atom must be preadsorbed. The Li adsorption energy, and thereby the Li coverage at a given potential, varies for the different carbon structures, demonstrating that the artificial nanostructure of the carbon can influence the formation of the SEI.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Approach to Increase the Utilization of Active Material in a High Sulfur-Loaded Cathode for High Areal Capacity Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Developing room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries with a high-sulfur-containing cathode and a relatively low amount of electrolyte is the prime factor for implementation of these batteries into the energy storage market. However, it is extremely challenging to achieve stable, long-term cyclability while utilizing a high-sulfur-loaded cathode, since strong adhesion of active material with the current collector should be maintained during charge-discharge. Here, we report manganese dioxide nanoarray-decorated carbon cloth conformally wrapped with sodium-alginate nanofibers (abbreviated as CC@MnO2@Na-alg) as a robust cathode current collector, which not only restricts the gradual dissolution of polysulfides but also offers good adhesion to the active material. To facilitate ion-transport kinetics, a liquid-phase Na2S6 catholyte is used as an active material. At 1C (C = 1672 mA g-1), the catholyte-infiltrated CC@MnO2@Na-alg electrode scaffold, with a high sulfur loading of 3.4 mg cm-2, exhibits a remarkable capacity retention of 94.4% after 1000 cycles. Comprehensive theoretical studies reveal the possible anchoring sites in sodium-alginate for the confinement of the polysulfide species.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Gel Polymer Electrolyte Membranes Boosted with Sodium-Conductive β-Alumina Nanoparticles: Application for Na-Ion Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Electrolytes, the crucial and indispensable component of a battery system, dominate the interfacial chemistry and the overall performances of the battery. In this work, a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)/poly(methyl methacrylate)-based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) membrane containing sodium-conductive β-alumina nanoparticles is synthesized. The resultant electrolyte membrane's performances can be boosted remarkably by the presence of β-alumina nanoparticles through decreasing the degree of crystallinity and improving Na-ion transference number, eventually enhancing the ionic conductivity. The GPE membrane embedded with a suitable amount of β-alumina nanoparticles delivers a high ionic conductivity of 2.39 × 10-3 S cm-1 and a wide electrochemical stability window at 5.04 V. The assembled Na3V2(PO4)3/GPE/Na cell has promising electrochemical performances with an initial discharge capacity of 94.1 mA h·g-1 and a capacity retention of 85% after 300 cycles at 0.5 C. This work proves that the addition of sodium conductors, similar to the presented β-alumina, could enhance the performances of GPE membranes, promoting the rapid development of rechargeable sodium-ion batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
BaTiO3-: G -GO as an efficient permselective material for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© the Partner Organisations.Notwithstanding the fact that the unique properties such as high theoretical capacity, energy density, low cost and environmental benignity have helped in identifying Li-S batteries as a potential successor of lithium-ion batteries, the inherently low conductivity of elemental sulfur, shuttling of polysulfide between two electrodes and undesirable interfacial properties of the lithium metal anode with electrolytes impede this system from commercialization. Myriad strategies have been adopted to surmount these challenges such as encapsulation of elemental sulfur in carbonaceous materials to enhance conductivity, introduction of modified separators to mitigate the shuttling of polysulfide etc. In the present work, hybrid nanoparticles, barium titanate-grafted-graphene oxide (BaTiO3-g-GO) was prepared by chemically coupling BaTiO3 to graphene oxide (GO) sheets by a solvothermal method. Additionally, biomass-derived activated carbon (AC) obtained from sisal fibres was also prepared. Trilayer membranes (TLM) were prepared by coating BaTiO3-g-GO and AC on either side of the commercially available Celgard 2320 separator. The Li-S cells with AC/BaTiO3-g-GO-coated trilayer permselective membranes delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1450 mA h g-1 at 0.1C and also appreciably suppressed the self-discharge of Li-S cells even after 40 h which opens up the venue for Li-S batteries to achieve long cycle life without self-discharge for multifarious applications.",Materials Chemistry Frontiers
Heterostructure enhanced sodium storage performance for SnS2in hierarchical SnS2/Co3S4nanosheet array composite,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Herein, a uniformly distributed SnS2/Co3S4 heterostructure nanosheet array was grown on carbon cloth (CC) fibers by a simple solvothermal method and an oil bath method. When the hierarchical SnS2/Co3S4@CC nanoarray composite is used as a binder-free anode for sodium-ion batteries, its charge and discharge capacity is stabilized at 910.1 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 after 100 cycles. Even under a high current density of 2 A g-1, after 760 long-Term cycles, the reversible capacity is stable at 637.2 mA h g-1, and still has excellent cycle stability with capacity retention of 87.3%. This excellent performance can be attributed to the reasonable design of the arrayed-electrode structure and the in situ growth of Co3S4 nanoparticles on the heterointerface of matrix SnS2 nanosheets: The well-defined array structure can shorten the diffusion path of Na+ ions and effectively alleviates volume expansion under long-cycle performance; the hierarchical heterostructure of SnS2/Co3S4 nanosheets can expand the interface contact area, provide more active sites and effectively enhance the electrochemical kinetics for sodium storage. The excellent electrochemical performance brought by the rational design of the heterogeneous nanostructure arrays provides new possibilities for the practical application of energy storage in the future.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

In situ growth of Sn nanoparticles confined carbon-based TiO2/TiN composite with long-term cycling stability for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2020Sn has attracted tremendous attentions in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) for its high theoretical capacity, low cost and high electronic conductivity. However, one of the critical problems to hinder the widely practical application of SIBs is the fast capacity decay during repeated charge/discharge cycles owing to the vast volume expansion and aggregation of Sn nanoparticles. Herein, the spatially confined strategy is introduced to synthesize Sn/C@TiO2/TiN composite to address the above issues. The dual space-confined layers of carbonaceous microspheres and TiO2 could effectively buffer the volume expansion of Sn nanoparticles. Moreover, the dual conductive matrix of the inner carbon and outer TiN are favorable to enhance the electrode conductivity and accelerate Na+ and electrons transfer. In addition, the first-principles simulation is further employed to investigate the electrochemical dynamics (structural deformation) of the electrode. As a result, Sn/C@TiO2/TiN electrode exhibits a long cycle life stability (retains a capacity of 201.2 mAh/g after 500 cycles at 0.5 A/g). This spatially confined strategy might exert a profound impact on designing desirable electrode materials with long cycle life and fast redox kinetics in SIBs.",Electrochimica Acta
Hierarchical 1 T-MoS2/MoOx@NC microspheres as advanced anode materials for potassium/sodium-ion batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Metallic MoS2 (1 T-MoS2) is expected as a new anode to effectively storage K+/Na+ due to the merits of high capacity, large layer distance and good metallic conductivity. The main bottleneck of 1 T-MoS2 anode stems from the structure pulverization caused by the large volume changes upon cycling, leading to the rapid capacity fading. Herein, hierarchical N-doped carbon modified 1 T-MoS2/MoOx microspheres (1 T-MoS2/MoOx@NC) assembled by some primary nanoparticles are first fabricated by a facile solvothermal synthesis and followed annealing treatment. As anode materials for potassium-ion batteries, 1 T-MoS2/MoOx@NC delivers the outstanding rate capability (257.9/128.8 mAh g−1 at 0.05/0.5 A g−1) and exceptional long-term cycle life up to 400 cycles. 1 T-MoS2/MoOx@NC as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries also shows high reversible capacity and outstanding cyclic stability (473.8 mAh g−1 over 1300 cycles at 2 A g−1). The related kinetics tests have been used to explain the excellent potassium/sodium storage performances. Meanwhile, the 1 T-MoS2/MoOx@NC//Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell for SIBs has been assembled, which exhibits good electrochemical performances. The discharge capacity can keep at 163.5 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. The excellent potassium/sodium storage performances are mainly attributed to the particular hierarchical structure as well as the synergistic effect of 1 T-MoS2, MoOx and N-doped carbon.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Challenges of today for Na-based batteries of the future: From materials to cell metrics,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Several emerging battery technologies are currently on endeavour to take a share of the dominant position taken by Li-ion batteries in the field of energy storage. Among them, sodium-based batteries offer a combination of attractive properties i.e., low cost, sustainable precursors and secure raw material supplies. Na-based batteries include related battery concepts, such as Na-ion, all solid-state Na batteries, Na/O2 and Na/S, that differ in key components and in redox chemistry, and therefore result in separate challenges and metrics. Na-ion batteries represent an attractive solution which is almost ready to challenge Li-ion technology in certain applications; the other cell concepts represent a more disruptive innovation, with a higher performance gain, provided that major hurdles are overcome. The present review aims at highlighting the most promising materials in the field of Na-based batteries and challenges needed to be addressed to make this technology industrially appealing, by providing an in-depth analysis of performance metrics from recent literature.

Sodiophilic Zn/SnO2 porous scaffold to stabilize sodium deposition for sodium metal batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Sodium is regarded as a promising electrode material in the post lithium ion battery era due to its high theoretical specific capacity of 1166 mAh g−1, low electrochemical potential (−2.71 V vs standard hydrogen electrode), low cost and high natural abundance. However, similar to lithium metal anode, sodium metal anode also shares the problems of uncontrollable dendrites growth, formation of unstable solid electrolyte interface and large volume change during repeated plating/stripping. Herein, a porous sodiophilic zinc metal framework modified with SnO2 surface layer is introduced on copper substrate and used as 3D current collector for sodium metal batteries in order to realize even deposition of Na, moderate the volume change and construct a stable solid electrolyte interface layer simultaneously. Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory are used to interpret the deposition behavior of the metallic Na on different current collectors. The electrochemical performance results show that the Cu/Zn/SnO2@Na symmetric cell can deliver an extremely low nucleation overpotential (0 mV), outstanding long-term rate performance over 1000 h and also can be cycled for around 700 h even at a high current density of 5 mA cm−2 for total capacity of 5 mAh cm−2.

Construction of CoP@C embedded into N/S-co-doped porous carbon sheets for superior lithium and sodium storage,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.To improve the electrical conductivity and relief the large volume variation, carbon coated CoP particles were designed to homogeneously embed into porous carbon sheets, which were synthesized though a simultaneous carbonization and phosphorization method. Notably, the uniform carbon shells and porous carbon sheets constructed a tough conductive matrix to enhance the electron transfer and structural stability during charging/discharging processes. Moreover, the heteroatom doping of nitrogen and sulfur could not only introduce more active sites and defects on the carbon sheets, but also increased electrical conductivity. Owing to the unique structure, the obtained material displayed good electrochemical performance for lithium storage (638.8 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 500 cycles and 334.9 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1) and sodium storage (329.4 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 150 cycles and 162.4 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1). More importantly, the reaction mechanism and the ion diffusion coefficient were explored by ex-situ XRD and EIS for both LIBs and SIBs.

Sulfur and phosphorus co-doped hard carbon derived from oak seeds enabled reversible sodium spheres filling and plating for ultra-stable sodium storage,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Hard carbon has been considered as a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), while suffers from poor rate performance and some safety issues caused by irreversible or undesirable sodium plating. Heteroatom doping is an effective strategy to further improve the electrochemical performance of hard carbon. Herein, biomass oak seeds are selected as carbon source to prepare S/P co-doped hard carbon through a simple one-step pyrolysis process. The hard carbon pyrolyzed from oak seeds at 1000 °C (C1000) exhibits excellent rate performance (initial discharge capacity is 136.1 mA h g−1) and remarkable cycling stability (1000 cycles with 88% capacity retention at 1000 mA g−1). The unique S/P co-doping is very important to the high electrochemical performances, since sulfur and phosphorus co-doping enlarges interlayer distance, modifies the electronic structure, as well as provides more effective active sites, thereby enabling hard carbon with a fast, complete charge transfer kinetics of sodium storage.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
In situ simultaneous encapsulation of defective MoS2 nanolayers and sulfur nanodots into SPAN fibers for high rate sodium-ion batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) with layered structure has emerged as a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) in light of its particular surface chemistry and physical structures. However, the MoS2-based SIBs usually suffered from the weaknesses of the low rate capability and poor cycling stability induced by the sluggish kinetics of Na+ intercalation and the diffluent discharge products. Herein, the defective MoS2 nanocrystals and sulfur nanodots simultaneously embedded in sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) fibers were fabricated via an electrospunning technology, followed by a simple annealing treatment. The unique architecture, in which MoS2 nanolayers and sulfur nanodots were mounted inside the SPAN fiber, provided multi-entry and short-range channel for sodium ion to ensure a fast kinetics. Besides, sulfur defects within MoS2 produced the strong chemical interaction for fixing soluble discharge products. As a result, the electrode performed outstanding sodium-storage performance with a superior long cycling life (8000 cycles at 5 A g−1, 15,000 cycles at 10 A g−1) and excellent rate capability (212 mAh g−1 at 25 A g−1).

"Functionalized M2TiC2T: X MXenes (M = Cr and Mo; T = F, O, and OH) as high performance electrode materials for sodium ion batteries","© the Owner Societies.First-principles calculations were performed to study the electrochemical performance of M2TiC2 (M = Cr or Mo) and M2TiC2Tx (T = O, F or OH) used as anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). The O functionalized MXenes (Cr2TiC2O2 and Mo2TiC2O2) are found to be more stable than F and OH terminated systems. The diffusion performance of sodium in MXene materials is mainly affected by the functional groups. The lowest diffusion barrier of functionalized MXenes is about one order larger in magnitude than that of bare MXenes. Although the introduction of O-groups hinders the diffusion of sodium, it can greatly improve the theoretical storage capacities. Meanwhile, the diffusion paths and diffusion energy barriers of Na are affected by Na concentration effects, while the interactions between terminations have little effect. Furthermore, multiple layers of sodium atoms are found to be adsorbed between the layers of M2TiC2O2, thus significantly increasing the theoretical capacities. The theoretical sodium storage capacities of M2TiC2O2 monolayers reach 515.70 mA h g-1 (M = Cr) and 362.46 mA h g-1 (M = Mo) and the OCVs can approach 0.034 V (M = Cr) and 0.042 V (M = Mo). Therefore, Cr2TiC2O2 and Mo2TiC2O2 are expected to be promising anode materials for SIBs due to their excellent properties, such as good electronic conductivity, low sodium diffusion barrier, and high theoretical sodium storage capacity.

Sub-nanometric Manganous Oxide Clusters in Nitrogen Doped Mesoporous Carbon Nanosheets for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© The greatest challenge for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries application is the development of cathode hosts to address the low conductivity, huge volume change, and shuttling effect of sulfur or lithium polysulfides (LiPs). Herein, we demonstrate a composite host to circumvent these problems by confining sub-nanometric manganous oxide clusters (MOCs) in nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon nanosheets. The atomic structure of MOCs is well-characterized and optimized via the extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Benefiting from the unique design, the assembled Li-S battery displays remarkable electrochemical performances including a high reversible capacity (990 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g-1) and a superior cycle life (60% retention over 250 cycles at 2 A g-1). Both the experimental results and DFT calculations demonstrate that the well-dispersed MOCs could significantly promote the chemisorption of LiPs, thus greatly improving the capacity and rate performance.",Nano Letters
Optical Microscopy Reveals the Ambient Sodium-Sulfur Discharge Mechanism,"© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.With growing demand for energy storage, there is renewed interest in ambient sodium-sulfur batteries, which boast raw material costs below $1/kWh owing to the natural abundance and high theoretical energy density of the pairing. As with lithium, sodium electrochemically reacts with sulfur in ether-based electrolytes, and the intermediate discharge products (polysulfides) dissolve in the battery electrolyte. These polysulfide intermediates have distinct colors, from red-brown to yellow. Additionally, when the solvent permits chemical reordering, the S3•- radical is detected with a blue hue. Radicalization hinders the electrochemical reaction by altering charge balance. Since the reaction intermediates exist with distinct colors, their evolution can be identified during electrochemical discharge with an in-situ optical cell. Optical analysis facilitates detection and characterization of intermediate products across a broader concentration range that is not accessed by more complex in-situ UV-vis spectroscopy. We demonstrate the utility of in-situ optical microscopy for comparing the ambient discharge mechanism in electrolytes from the glyme family. These chain-like solvents, from monoglyme (G1) to tetraglyme (G4), have a greater stabilizing effect on sodium electroplating than for lithium, warranting their investigation at the sulfur cathode. Both the in-situ experiment and stoichiometric solutions reveal that G1 results in the lowest polysulfide solubility and the least sulfur radicalization, while G4 has the greatest. G2 falls between them. Image analysis of the electrolyte between the sulfur working electrode and sodium counter allow for the red, green, and blue image pixilation (RGB) and image brightness to be assessed. With this analysis, we can assign the evolution of particular polysulfides to discharge voltage features.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering

The introduction of Co cations into the precursor is crucial, because it leads to the dispersion of single-atom Co on the carbon matrix, decreasing the size and improving the dispersion of the resultant ZnS-QDs as well. Benefitting from the resilient and stable carbon framework, the single-atom Co and small ZnS-QDs synergically electro-catalyze the S redox process, which can greatly enhance sodium polysulfide conversion and reduction of non-conductive Na2S. The refined S cathode achieves remarkable cycling capability (640 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.1 A g-1), enhanced capacity retention, and outstanding energy density (541 W h kg-1), giving it great promise for scientific research and practical applications.

MXene-based materials for lithium-sulfur and multivalent rechargeable batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.MXene, a 2D material, is the future of materials science research. Its combination of surface hydrophilicity and metallic conductivity makes it most important for researchers. MXenes have exceptional conductivity and volumetric capacitance because of the presence of single-layered nanosheets, usually obtained by the exfoliation of transition metals. These nanosheets can also be easily intercalated with various ions and molecules between their layers. Lithium (Li) and sulfur (S) are well-known materials for battery applications, but the problems of surface properties and the formation of polysulfide molecules are preventing the commercialization of research into these batteries. In the Li-S battery mechanism, the release of various ions over the electrolyte causes polysulfide leakage from the cathode side. To resolve this issue and to make the Li-S battery a commercializable product, researchers are investigating various techniques. One among these is the intercalation of MXene materials and the use of MXene-based materials for Li-S rechargeable batteries. Research has shown that flexibility and high electrical conductivity give Li-S-intercalated MXenes excellent charge rates and superior cyclic stability compared with graphite. MXene materials research shows excellent prospects for the commercialization and industrial production of Li-S and multivalent rechargeable batteries. This chapter describes MXene-based materials that are suitable for Li-S and multivalent rechargeable batteries and includes details about the materials, the preparation of composite materials, and their physical and electrochemical properties as cathode and anode materials.

Here we critically review the state-of-the-art in separators/interlayers for cathode and anode protection, covering the Li-S and the emerging Na-S and K-S systems. The approaches for improving electrochemical performance may be categorized as one or a combination of the following: Immobilization of polysulfides (cathode); catalyzing sulfur redox kinetics (cathode); introduction of protective layers to serve as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) (anode); and combined improvement in electrolyte wetting and homogenization of ion flux (anode and cathode). It is demonstrated that while the advances in Li-S are relatively mature, less progress has been made with Na-S and K-S due to the more challenging redox chemistry at the cathode and increased electrochemical instability at the anode. Throughout these sections there is a complementary discussion of functional separators for emerging alkali metal systems based on metal-selenium and the metal-selenium sulfide. The focus then shifts to interlayers and artificial SEI/cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers employed to stabilize solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) in metal-sulfur solid-state batteries (SSBs). The discussion of SSEs focuses on inorganic electrolytes based on Li- and Na-based oxides and sulfides but also touches on some hybrid systems with an inorganic matrix and a minority polymer phase. The review then moves to practical considerations for functional separators, including scaleup issues and Li-S technoeconomics. The review concludes with an outlook section, where we discuss emerging mechanics, spectroscopy, and advanced electron microscopy (e.g. cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB))-based approaches for analysis of functional separator structure-battery electrochemical performance interrelations. Throughout the review we identify the outstanding open scientific and technological questions while providing recommendations for future research topics.",Chemical Reviews
Sub-nanoscale Engineering of MoO2 Clusters for Enhanced Sodium Storage,"© 2021 Zhengzhou UniversitySmart construction of battery-type anodes with high rate and good mechanical properties is significant for advanced sodium ion capacitors (SICs). Herein, a flexible film consisting of MoO2 subnanoclusters encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (MoO2 SCs@N-CNFs) is designed and synthesized via electrospinning toward SICs as anodes. The strong N-Mo interaction guarantees the stable yet uniform dispersion of high loading MoO2 SCs (≈40 wt.%) in the flexible carbonaceous substrate. The sub-nanoscale effect of SCs restrains electrode pulverization and improves the Na+ diffusion kinetics, rendering better pseudocapacitance-dominated Na+-storage properties than the nanocrystal counterpart. The MoO2 SCs@N-CNFs paper with mass loadings of 2.2–10.1 mg cm−2 can be directly used as free-standing anode for SICs, which exhibit high reversible gravimetric/areal capacities both in liquid and quasi-solid-state electrolytes. The assembled flexible SICs competitively exhibit exceptional energy density and cycling stability. More significantly, the sub-nanoscale engineering strategy here is promisingly generalized to future electrode design for other electrochemical energy-related applications and beyond.",Energy and Environmental Materials
Redox Catalysis Promoted Activation of Sulfur Redox Chemistry for Energy-Dense Flexible Solid-State Zn-S Battery,"© XXXX American Chemical Society.In aqueous Zn-ion batteries, the intercalation chemistry often foil attempts at the realization of high energy density. Unlocking the full potential of zinc-sulfur redox chemistry requires the manipulation of the feedbacks between kinetic response and the cathode's composition. The cell degradation mechanism also should be tracked simultaneously. Herein, we design a high-energy Zn-S system where the high-capacity cathode was fabricated by in situ interfacial polymerization of Fe(CN)64-doped polyaniline within the sulfur nanoparticle. Compared with sulfur, the FeII/III(CN)64/3- redox mediators exhibit substantially faster cation (de)insertion kinetics. The higher cathodic potential (FeII(CN)64-/FeIII(CN)63- ∼0.8 V vs S/S2- ∼0.4 V) spontaneously catalyzes the full reduction of sulfur during battery discharge (S8 + Zn2FeII(CN)6 ↔ ZnS + Zn1.5FeIII(CN)6, ΔG = -24.7 kJ mol-1). The open iron redox species render a lower energy barrier to ZnS activation during the reverse charging process, and the facile Zn2+ intercalative transport facilitates highly reversible conversion between S and ZnS. The yolk-shell structured cathode with 70 wt % sulfur delivers a reversible capacity of 1205 mAh g-1 with a flat operation voltage of 0.58 V, a fade rate over 200 cycles of 0.23%/cycle, and an energy density of 720 Wh kgsulfur-1. A range of ex situ investigations reveal the degradation nature of Zn-S cells: aggregation of inactive ZnS nanocrystals rather than the depletion of Zn anode. Impressively, the flexible solid-state Zn battery employing the composite cathode was assembled, realizing an energy density of 375 Wh kgsulfur-1. The proposed redox electrocatalysis effect provides reliable insights into the tunable Zn-S chemistry.",ACS Nano

Progress and innovation of nanostructured sulfur cathodes and metal-free anodes for room-temperature Na-S batteries,"© 2021 Tabuyo-Martinez et al.; licensee Beilstein-Institut. License and terms: see end of document. All Rights Reserved.Rechargeable batteries are a major element in the transition to renewable energie systems, but the current lithium-ion battery technology may face limitations in the future concerning the availability of raw materials and socio-economic insecurities. Sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries are a promising alternative energy storage device for small- to large-scale applications driven by more favorable environmental and economic perspectives. However, scientific and technological problems are still hindering a commercial breakthrough of these batteries. This review discusses strategies to remedy some of the current drawbacks such as the polysulfide shuttle effect, catastrophic volume expansion, Na dendrite growth, and slow reaction kinetics by nanostructuring both the sulfur cathode and the Na anode. Moreover, a survey of recent patents on room temperature (RT) Na-S batteries revealed that nanostructured sulfur and sodium electrodes are still in the minority, which suggests that much investigation and innovation is needed until RT Na-S batteries can be commercialized.",Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology
A novel long-duration hydrogen storage concept without liquefaction and high pressure suitable for onsite blending,"© 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All rights reserved.Hydrogen is typically stored as a low-pressure cryogenic liquid or as a high-pressure gas. Both approaches come with technical challenges that complicate the implementation of such systems at the actual power plant scale. Cryogenic liquids can provide high energy and volume densities but require complex storage systems to limit boil-off. That makes such liquid tanks complex, large, and heavy which in turn drives up capital cost. Furthermore, expensive liquefaction equipment is required, too. The liquefaction process is highly energy-intensive, approximately 35% of the fuel energy, hence, reduces the net performance of gas turbine power plants using such hydrogen storage approaches. Conversely, high-pressure gas storage bottles are less complex and can be kept at room temperature. However, they require a thick wall to withstand the high pressure which makes them considerably heavy as well. Furthermore, the energy densities associated with gas storage are dramatically lower than for cryogenic liquids, even at high pressures up to 700 bar. The present study presents and discusses a novel concept for storing hydrogen to be used in gas turbine power plants. Proposed technology enables the storage of hydrogen close to cryogenic density without the need for high pressure or liquefaction and the delivery to the gas turbine asset can be at engine pressure so that no gas compression is required. It is believed that the capacity of the storage system scales easily so that hydrogen can be stored for long durations from daily to monthly cycles which correspond to 10 to 100 hours, respectively. Besides a SWOT analysis, a system will be described that would integrate into the existing OEM infrastructure and allows the blending of hydrogen and natural gas between ratios between 30% and 100%. Specifications will be provided for the storage system and analyzed for a gas turbine power plant with 100 MW.",Proceedings of the ASME Turbo Expo
A Monolithic Solid-State Sodium-Sulfur Battery with Al-Doped Na3.4Zr2(Si0.8P0.2O4)3Electrolyte,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.The limit of the energy density and increasing security issues on sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) impede their further development. Solid-state sodium metal batteries are potential candidates to replace the present SIBs. However, low ionic conductivity and poor interface contact hinder their progress. In this work, the impact of Al doping on the crystalline structure and ionic transport in Na3.4Zr2(Si0.8P0.2O4)3 was studied by neutron powder diffraction. The ionic conductivity of Na3.5Zr1.9Al0.1Si2.4P0.6O12 achieves 4.43 × 10-3 S cm-1 at 50 °C. The polarization voltage of the Na||Na symmetric battery is about 40 mV after cycling for more than 1600 h. Moreover, a solid-state sodium-sulfur battery with a monolithic structure was constructed to alleviate the interfacial resistance problems. Its specific discharge capacity can still keep 300 mA h g-1 after 480 cycles at 300 mA g-1. The work provides a promising strategy to design solid-state sodium-sulfur batteries with high performances.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Type VIII Ba8Ga16-δSn30+δClathrate (δ≈ 1) during Lithiation,"© 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.Clathrates of the tetrel (Tt = Si, Ge, Sn) elements are host-guest structures that can undergo Li alloying reactions with high capacities. However, little is known about how the cage structure affects the phase transformations that take place during lithiation. To further this understanding, the structural changes of the type VIII clathrate Ba8Ga16-δSn30+δ (δ≈ 1) during lithiation are investigated and compared to those in β-Sn with ex situ X-ray total scattering measurements and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. The results show that the type VIII clathrate undergoes an alloying reaction to form Li-rich amorphous phases (LixBa0.17Ga0.33Sn0.67, x = 2-3) with local structures similar to those in the crystalline binary Li-Sn phases that form during the lithiation of β-Sn. As a result of the amorphous phase transition, the type VIII clathrate reacts at a lower voltage (0.25 V vs Li/Li+) compared to β-Sn (0.45 V) and goes through a solid-solution reaction after the initial conversion of the crystalline clathrate phase. Cycling experiments suggest that the amorphous phase persists after the first lithiation and results in considerably better cycling than in β-Sn. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that topotactic Li insertion into the clathrate lattice is not favorable due to the high energy of the Li sites, which is consistent with the experimentally observed amorphous phase transformation. The local structure in the clathrate featuring Ba atoms surrounded by a cage of Ga and Sn atoms is hypothesized to kinetically circumvent the formation of Li-Sn or Li-Ga crystalline phases, which results in better cycling and a lower reaction voltage. Based on the improved electrochemical performance, clathrates could act as tunable precursors to form amorphous Li alloying phases with novel electrochemical properties.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Dual redox catalysis of VN/nitrogen-doped graphene nanocomposites for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Science PressLithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are regarded as one of the promising candidates for the next-generation energy storage system owing to their high capacity and energy density. However, the durable operation for the batteries is blocked by the shuttle behavior of soluble lithium polysulfides and the sluggish kinetics in the redox process. Here, VN nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped graphene (VN/NG) composite is synthesized by simple calcining method to modify the separators, which can not only chemically trap polysulfides, but also catalyze the conversion reaction between the polysulfides and the insoluble Li2S during the charge/discharge process. The catalytic effects of VN/NG are verified by the calculated activation energy (Ea), which is smaller than the counterpart with NG toward both directions of redox. Because of the synergistic adsorption-catalysis of VN/NG, the cells with VN/NG-modified separators deliver a superior rate performance (791 mAh g−1 at 5C) and cycling stability (863 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles with a low decaying rate of 0.068% per loop at 1C). This work provides a simple preparation strategy and fundamental understanding of the bifunctional catalyst for high-performance Li-S batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Study on the improvement of electrochemical performance by controlling the surface characteristics of the oxygen electrode porous transport layer for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis,"© 2021, Korean Society of Industrial Engineering Chemistry. All rights reserved.Recently, due to concerns about the depletion of fossil fuels and the emission of greenhouse gases, the importance of hydrogen energy technology, which is a clean energy source that does not emit greenhouse gases, is being emphasized. Water electrolysis technology is a green hydrogen technology that obtains hydrogen by electrolyzing water and is attracting attention as one of the ultimate clean future energy resources. In this study, the surface properties of the porous transport layer (PTL), one of the cell components of the proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), were controlled using a sandpaper to re-duce overvoltage and increase performance and stability. The surfaces of PTL were sanded using sandpapers of 400, 180, and 100 grit, and then all samples were finally treated with the sandpaper of 1000 grit. The prepared PTL was analyzed for the degree of hydrophilicity by measuring the water contact angle, and the surface shape was observed through SEM analysis. In order to analyze the electrochemical characteristics, I-V performance curves and impedance measurements were conducted.",Applied Chemistry for Engineering
A robust polymeric binder based on complementary multiple hydrogen bonds in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The practical application of sulfur cathodes in traditional lithium–sulfur batteries has been hindered by the substantial deterioration of the sulfur electrode due to the polysulfide shuttling effect and the large volume expansion of the electrode during charge/discharge cycling. The resolving of this issue demands for a robust binder to hold the polysulfide/sulfur particles, but without causing severe disintegration of the electrode. A polar polymeric binder with high mechanical strength was designed and synthesized for use in high-performance sulfur cathodes. The complementary multiple hydrogen bonds formed in the polymeric binder significantly enhanced the adhesive strength of the binder, and buffered the dramatic volume expansion of the sulfur cathode during cycling. The strong physical and chemical interactions between the functional groups (e.g. carboxyl and tertiary amine groups) of the binder and the polysulfides effectively mitigated the shuttling effect in the Li–S batteries. As a consequence, the sulfur cathode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance at a high sulfur loading, yielding an initial discharge capacity of 627.8 mA h g−1 with sulfur loading up to 9.610 mg cm−2 at a rate of 0.2C, corresponding to an aerial capacity of 6.03 mA h cm−1. The present work opens a new avenue for constructing a high-performance Li–S battery using a simple and effective binder.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Two Competing Reactions of Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Produce High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is an attractive cathode candidate for the advanced lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries owing to its outstanding cyclic stability. Nevertheless, SPAN suffers from inadequate initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) induced by the sluggish reaction kinetics, which is primarily ascribed to the low Li-ion diffusivity and high electronic resistivity of the Li2S product. In this work, an optimal trace amount of soluble lithium polysulfide of Li2S8 is introduced as a redox mediator for a freestanding fibrous SPAN cathode to enhance the reversible oxidation efficiency of Li2S. During the delithiation process, the chemical interactions between Li2S and Li2S8 additive facilitate the electrochemical oxidation of Li2S, resulting in the transformation of not only C-S/S-S bonds in SPAN but also elemental sulfur. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the two competing reactions, a high initial CE of 82.9% could be achieved at a current density of 200 mA g-1. Moreover, a superior capacity retention along with a high capacity of 1170 mAh g-1 up to the 400th cycle is available at 1000 mA g-1. The study offers a feasible approach for Li-S batteries toward the practical applications of SPAN.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Ionic Liquid (IL) Laden Metal-Organic Framework (IL-MOF) Electrolyte for Quasi-Solid-State Sodium Batteries,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.An ionic liquid (IL) laden metal-organic framework (MOF) sodium-ion electrolyte has been developed for ambient-temperature quasi-solid-state sodium batteries. The MOF skeleton is designed according to a UIO-66 (Universitetet i Oslo) structure. A sodium sulfonic (-SO3Na) group grafted to the UIO-based MOF ligand improves the Na+-ion conductivity. Upon lading with a sodium-based ionic liquid (Na-IL), sodium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) in 1-n-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Bmpyr-TFSI), the Na-IL laden sulfonated UIO-66 (UIOSNa) quasi-solid electrolyte exhibits a Na+-ion conductivity of 3.6 × 10-4 S cm-1 at ambient temperature. Quasi-solid-state sodium batteries with the Na-IL/UIOSNa electrolyte are demonstrated with a layered Na3Ni1.5TeO6 cathode and sodium-metal anode.

Nickel–Cobalt Hydroxides with Tunable Thin-Layer Nanosheets for High-Performance Supercapacitor Electrode,"© 2021, The Author(s).Layered double hydroxides as typical supercapacitor electrode materials can exhibit superior energy storage performance if their structures are well regulated. In this work, a simple one-step hydrothermal method is used to prepare diverse nickel–cobalt layered double hydroxides (NiCo-LDHs), in which the different contents of urea are used to regulate the different nanostructures of NiCo-LDHs. The results show that the decrease in urea content can effectively improve the dispersibility, adjust the thickness and optimize the internal pore structures of NiCo-LDHs, thereby enhancing their capacitance performance. When the content of urea is reduced from 0.03 to 0.0075 g under a fixed precursor materials mass ratio of nickel (0.06 g) to cobalt (0.02 g) of 3:1, the prepared sample NiCo-LDH-1 exhibits the thickness of 1.62 nm, and the clear thin-layer nanosheet structures and a large number of surface pores are formed, which is beneficial to the transmission of ions into the electrode material. After being prepared as a supercapacitor electrode, the NiCo-LDH-1 displays an ultra-high specific capacitance of 3982.5 F g−1 under the current density of 1 A g−1 and high capacitance retention above 93.6% after 1000 cycles of charging and discharging at a high current density of 10 A g−1. The excellent electrochemical performance of NiCo-LDH-1 is proved by assembling two-electrode asymmetric supercapacitor with carbon spheres, displaying the specific capacitance of 95 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with the capacitance retention of 78% over 1000 cycles. The current work offers a facile way to control the nanostructure of NiCo-LDHs, confirms the important affection of urea on enhancing capacitive performance for supercapacitor electrode and provides the high possibility for the development of high-performance supercapacitors.",Nanoscale Research Letters
Production and purification of anhydrous sodium sulfide,"© 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Anhydrous sodium sulfide (Na2S) is a key component in sodium-sulfur batteries as well as an important chemical reagent. However, anhydrous Na2S is currently prohibitively expensive for applications outside of research labs, and purity is a concern. Herein, we compare the properties of three forms of anhydrous Na2S: (i) commercially supplied, (ii) Na2S produced through dehydration and purification of commercial hydrate flakes (Na2S•xH2O), and (iii) Na2S formed by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with dissolved sodium alkoxide and recovered through solvent evaporation. Vacuum annealing of low-cost Na2S hydrate at 150°C produced anhydrous Na2S. This dehydrated material retains impurity signatures attributed to polysulfide (Na2S x) and oxysulfur impurities (SO x) that were also observed in commercially supplied Na2S. Impurity removal typically requires hydrogen reduction at very high temperature (700–900°C), but it is demonstrated here that this can instead be accomplished at 400°C, preventing auto-oxidation and following kinetics well-described by a shrinking core model. The solution-based approach resulted in the direct synthesis of crystalline Na2S anhydride at low temperatures (100°C) without need for further purification. Both approaches presented herein are inherently scalable with materials costs that are one to two orders of magnitude lower than the current price of anhydrous Na2S.",Journal of Sulfur Chemistry

Lithium-activated SnS-graphene alternating nanolayers enable dendrite-free cycling of thin sodium metal anodes in carbonate electrolyte,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sodium metal battery (SMB, NMB) anodes can become dendritic due to an electrochemically unstable native Na-based solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein Li-ion activated tin sulfide graphene nanocomposite membrane (A-SnS-G) is employed as an artificial SEI layer, allowing cyclability of record-thin 100 µm Na metal foils. The thin Na metal is prepared by a self-designed metallurgical rolling protocol. A-SnS-G is initially placed onto the polypropylene (PP) separator but becomes in situ transferred onto the Na metal surface. Symmetric metal cells protected by A-SnS-G achieve low-overpotential extended high-rate cycling in a standard carbonate electrolyte (EC?:?DEC = 1?:?1, 5% FEC). Accumulated capacity of 1000 mA h cm-2 is obtained after 500 cycles at 4 mA cm-2, with accumulated capacity-to-foil capacity (A/F) ratio of 90.9. This is among the most favorable cycle life, accumulated capacity, and anode utilization combinations reported. Protection by non-activated SnS-G membrane yields significantly worse cycling, albeit still superior to the baseline unprotected sodium. Post-mortem and dedicated light optical analysis indicate that metal swelling, dendrite growth and dead metal formation is extensive for the unprotected sample, but is suppressed with A-SnS-G. Per XPS, post-100 cycles near-surface structure of A-SnS-G is rich in metallic Sn alloys and inorganic carbonate salts. Even after 300 cycles, Li-based SEI components ROCO2-Li, Li2CO3 and LiF are detected with A-SnS-G. As a proof of principle, an SMB with a high mass loading (6 mg cm-2) NVP cathode and a A-SnS-G protected anode delivered extended cyclability, achieving 74 mA h g-1 after 400 cycles at 0.4C.",Energy and Environmental Science
Efficient Catalytic Conversion of Polysulfides by Biomimetic Design of “Branch-Leaf” Electrode for High-Energy Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s).Rechargeable room temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries are seriously limited by low sulfur utilization and sluggish electrochemical reaction activity of polysulfide intermediates. Herein, a 3D “branch-leaf” biomimetic design proposed for high performance Na–S batteries, where the leaves constructed from Co nanoparticles on carbon nanofibers (CNF) are fully to expose the active sites of Co. The CNF network acts as conductive “branches” to ensure adequate electron and electrolyte supply for the Co leaves. As an effective electrocatalytic battery system, the 3D “branch-leaf” conductive network with abundant active sites and voids can effectively trap polysulfides and provide plentiful electron/ions pathways for electrochemical reaction. DFT calculation reveals that the Co nanoparticles can induce the formation of a unique Co–S–Na molecular layer on the Co surface, which can enable a fast reduction reaction of the polysulfides. Therefore, the prepared “branch-leaf” CNF-L@Co/S electrode exhibits a high initial specific capacity of 1201 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and superior rate performance.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters

"A Carbon Foam with Sodiophilic Surface for Highly Reversible, Ultra-Long Cycle Sodium Metal Anode","© 2020 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHSodium metal anodes combine low redox potential (−2.71 V versus SHE) and high theoretical capacity (1165 mAh g−1), becoming a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries. Due to the infinite volume change, unstable SEI films, and Na dendrite growth, it is arduous to achieve a long lifespan. Herein, an oxygen-doped carbon foam (OCF) derived from starch is reported. Heteroatom doping can significantly reduce the nucleation resistance of sodium metal; combined with its rich pore structure and large specific surface area, OCF provides abundant nucleation sites to effectively guide the nucleation and subsequent growth of sodium metal, and the nature of this foam can accommodate the deposited sodium. Furthermore, a more uniform, robust, and stable SEI layer is observed on the surface of OCF electrode, so it can maintain ultra-high reversibility and excellent integrity for a long time without dendritic growth. As a result, when the current density is 10 mA cm−2, the electrode can maintain stable 2000 cycles and the coulombic efficiency can reach to 99.83%. Na@OCF||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell also has extremely high capacity retention of about 97.53% over 150 cycles. These results provide a simple but effective method for achieving the safety and commercialization of sodium metal anode.",Advanced Science

Unfortunately, it still suffers from poor cycling life and low coulombic efﬁciency caused by the shuttling effect of lithium polysulﬁdes. Herein, we designed a nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon host (NHPC) for physical and chemical confinement of polysulﬁdes to effectively reduce the shuttling effect. This NHPC was prepared by a simple one-step pyrolysis process using low-cost ascorbic acid as the carbon source, melamine as the nitrogen source and Zn(NO3)2 as the pore generating and carbon exfoliation agent. The resulted NHPC was found to possess randomly stacked ultrathin holy carbon sheets, high BET surface area and pore volume, rich micro- and meso-pores and enriched nitrogen doping. When infiltrated with sulfur, the resulted NHPC/S material was found to exhibit excellent electrochemical cycling performance. It delivered a high initial capacity of 1200 mAh/g at 0.2C, a reversible capacity of 729 mAh/g after 300 cycles at 1.0C and excellent cycling stability with a capacity decay of only 0.057% per cycle after 300 cycles at 1.0C. This work demonstrated a facile and efficient route to synthesize nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon host for immobilization of sulfur in Li–S battery technology.",Microporous and Mesoporous Materials
In situ formation of poly(butyl acrylate)-based non-flammable elastic quasi-solid electrolyte for dendrite-free flexible lithium metal batteries with long cycle life for wearable devices,"© 2020With the rapid development of wearable devices, there is an increasing demand for ultra-safe flexible lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) capable of delivering high energy density. Because it can provide the highest possible capacity of 3860 mAh g-1, lithium metal has drawn tremendous research attention. However, Li is a highly reactive metal that grows dendrites during the cycling of lithium-metal batteries (LMBs). To resolve the problem, we developed a new non-flammable elastic quasi-solid electrolyte (QSE), which can be polymerized in situ and whose composition is tailored to achieve high elasticity. Moreover, the incorporation of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) renders the electrolyte non-flammable. Thanks to the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed, the LMB with QSE displays excellent cycling stability as it can be operated for 500 cycles, with a capacity retention of 94%. The corresponding symmetric cell cycled stably for more than 500 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is critical in forming the LiF-rich SEI that enables long-term cycling stability. In brief, a non-flammable, elastic, and stable QSE is reported for the first time, which is very promising in the application of the next-generation wearable devices.",Energy Storage Materials
Rationally designed nanostructured metal chalcogenides for advanced sodium-ion batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.With the rapid growth of lithium-ion battery (LIB) market raising concerns about limited lithium resources and their surging prices, rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted growing attention as an alternative to LIBs because of abundance and low cost of sodium precursors and significantly reduced fabrication costs arising from the use of Al as the anode current collector. Metal chalcogenides (MCs) have emerged as potential anodes of SIBs thanks to a large variety of available species, abundance, low cost, unique physical and chemical properties, and high theoretical capacities. However, MCs face several challenges like large volume changes during sodiation and desodiation, poor electrical conductivities, and lack of large-scale production. Hence, various strategies have been employed to address these issues for practical applications of SIBs. This review is dedicated to integrating recent progress in rational design of nanostructured MCs for SIBs. Layer- and non-layer structured MCs assembled with nanocarbon materials are discussed along with their underlying reaction mechanisms. A special focus is placed on discussion of the findings from advanced in situ/operando characterization techniques and atomistic and molecular level simulations with various examples to shed comprehensive mechanistic insights into the sodiation and desodiation processes. Finally, the challenges, potential solutions, and future perspectives for exploring new SIB electrode materials are highlighted.",Energy Storage Materials
Boosting Dual-Directional Polysulfide Electrocatalysis via Bimetallic Alloying for Printable Li–S Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe rational design of electrocatalyst has readily stimulated a burgeoning interest in expediting polysulfide conversion and hence essentially restricting the “shuttle effect” in Li–S systems. Nevertheless, seldom efforts have been devoted to probing the dual-directional polysulfide electrocatalysis to date. Herein, a CoFe alloy decorated mesoporous carbon sphere (CoFe-MCS) serving as a promising mediator for Li–S batteries is reported. Such bimetallic alloying boosts dual-directional electrocatalytic activity toward effective polysulfide conversion throughout detailed electroanalytic characterization, theoretical calculation, and operando instrumental probing. Accordingly, the S@CoFe-MCS cathode harvests a stable cycling with a low capacity decay rate of 0.062% per cycle over 500 cycles at 2.0 C. More encouragingly, benefiting from the optimized redox kinetics and delicate grid architecture, printable S@CoFe-MCS cathode achieves an excellent rate performance at a sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm−2 and advanced areal capacity of 6.0 mAh cm−2 at 7.7 mg cm−2. This work explores non-precious metal alloy electrocatalysts in printable cathodes toward dual-directional polysulfide conversion, holding great potential in the pursuit of Li–S commercialization.",Advanced Functional Materials
Dual-porosity carbon derived from waste bamboo char for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries using carbonate-based electrolyte,"© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries have recently drawn a great deal of attention owing to their low cost and high theoretical energy density, making them promising energy storage systems. In this study, a dual-porosity carbon (DPC) matrix with oxygen-containing functional groups derived from waste bamboo char was synthesized by a facile chemical activation for RT Na-S batteries. A high initial discharge capacity of 1168 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and a superior capacity retention of 320 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C over 600 cycles were obtained. The excellent electrochemical performances came from the unique porous structure and oxygen-containing functional groups of DPC. These properties combined physical and chemical methods to anchor polysulfides and further enhance the electrochemical performance. This study has great significance in terms of building a relationship between waste biomass and electrochemical materials, providing low-cost, green, and sustainable development of advanced energy materials in the future.",Ionics
Supersaturated bridge-sulfur and vanadium co-doped M0S2 nanosheet arrays with enhanced sodium storage capability,"© 2020, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The low specific capacity and sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics greatly block the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). New high-performance electrode materials will enhance development and are urgently required for SIBs. Herein, we report the preparation of supersaturated bridge-sulfur and vanadium co-doped MoS2 nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth (denoted as V-MoS2+x/CC). The bridge-sulfur in MoS2 has been created as a new active site for greater Na+ storage. The vanadium doping increases the density of carriers and facilitates accelerated electron transfer. The synergistic dual-doping effects endow the V-MoS2+x/CC anodes with high sodium storage performance. The optimized V-MoS2.49/CC gives superhigh capacities of 370 and 214 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 and 10 A·g−1 within 0.4−3.0 V, respectively. After cycling 3,000 times at 2 A·g−1, almost 83% of the reversible capacity is maintained. The findings indicate that the electrochemical performances of metal sulfides can be further improved by edge-engineering and lattice-doping co-modification concept.

For many years NASICON compounds have not been regarded as a possible electrode material for SIBs, mainly because, the research was focusing on the electrolyte aspect. However, in recent years NASICON type materials have attracted a great deal of attention as an electrode as well due to their excellent properties, which include high ionic mobility, better safety and improved structural stability. This review for the first time features and consolidates the ion diffusion mechanisms and crystal structures of different explored NASICON materials. It also provides insight into the present challenges to commercialize these materials for developing functional SIBs. We believe that the thorough understanding of the ion diffusion mechanisms and crystal structures of NASICON based materials is necessary to design new electrodes and will be useful to improve the electrochemical performances of SIBs. The advantages/disadvantages of each category of materials are also discussed. Apart from the widely investigated NASICON type cathode and anode materials, the rarely explored electrolyte material is also included for the complete review of this potential material.

Organic liquid electrolytes in Li-S batteries: actualities and perspectives,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.To meet future application requirement for large-scale energy storage systems, as a promising candidate, lithium–sulfur battery has attracted extensive attention and has been thoroughly explored due to its high theoretical cathodic capacity (1, 675 mAh g−1) and the low cost of sulfur. Its practical application is hindered by the known challenges, including inferior cycle stability and low charging efficiency etc. despite extensive studies in last decades. Most researchers have focused on developing novel host materials for sulfur cathode, protecting lithium metal anode by artificial SEI layers, and structure optimization of Li-S battery. The primary issue is the high solubility of lithium sulfide intermediates (Li2Sn, 3≤n≤8) in liquid organic electrolytes, which results in a “polysulfide shuttle effect” and rapid capacity fading. Compared with solid-state electrolytes, up to now, traditional liquid state electrolytes are still the most favorable choice for the commercialization of Li-S batteries. Each component of liquid electrolyte, such as solvents, lithium salts and additives, is related to dissolution of polysulfide intermediates and formation of SEI film on lithium metal anode. Motivated by strong demand of the state-of-art electrolyte systems for high performance Li-S batteries, researchers have tried to explore more novel electrolyte systems. In this review, the recent progress of liquid electrolyte systems are summarized and discussed. In addition, we also review some new concepts and the reaction mechanisms of the electrolytes in Li-S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Synthesis strategies towards amorphous porous carbons with selective oxygen functionalization for the application as reference material,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdManipulation of carbon surface functionalization and especially of oxygen surface groups has been demonstrated to be key for obtaining high performance materials in a multitude of applications. Although control of carbon surface chemistry offers large potential in many technical relevant applications, qualitative and quantitative analysis of surface oxides for amorphous and porous carbons remains challenging. In this study, we attempt selective, organic chemistry-based functionalization of a polymer-derived porous model carbon featuring high oxygen loadings, with the aim to establish analytical standards for temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). In this context, quantitative chemical reduction of an oxidized carbon material with lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) is utilized as the key for the synthesis of carbon materials with defined ensembles of oxygen surface groups (hydroxyl groups and ethers). Based on this reduction strategy, selective LiAlH4 reduction based on protection group chemistry leads to aldehydes, ketones and quinones as surface functional groups and chemical grafting is studied for the selective introduction of phenyl esters, methyl ethers and carboxylic acids. All materials are evaluated with respect to the applicability as analytical standard by DRIFT spectroscopy, TPD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and titration methods.",Carbon

In this review, the optimization, the matching strategies and the advanced characterization techniques of the electrolytes system for HCs and P-based anodes are discussed based on the recent advance. The effective optimization strategies are summarized from three aspects: sodium salts, solvents, and additives.

Inorganic sodium solid-state electrolyte and interface with sodium metal for room-temperature metal solid-state batteries,"© 2020Metal solid-state batteries are regarded as the next-generation energy storage systems with high energy density and high safety. A robust and intimate solid-state interfacial contact between the sodium metal with the solid-state electrolyte (SSE) is vital to achieve good cyclic stability at high current density. However, inorganic SSEs suffer from poor stability when cycling at a current density below 2 mA cm−2. This can be ascribed to the dendrite formation through the SSE due to plating process or void formation during the stripping process. Furthermore, simply direct application of a sodium metal on SSE shows poor interfacial contact and low critical current density. In this review, the recent development of inorganic sodium-ion electrolytes, such as oxide-, sulphide-, and halide-based, are briefly discussed. More particularly, the dendrite formation through the SSE and the loss of solid-solid contact at the sodium/SSE interface are reviewed. Additionally, different engineering approaches to integrate the sodium metal with the solid-state electrolytes and its correlation with the electrochemical performance are discussed. Finally, perspectives in future researches are identified.",Energy Storage Materials
"Prelithiation/Presodiation Techniques for Advanced Electrochemical Energy Storage Systems: Concepts, Applications, and Perspectives","© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHPrelithiation/presodiation techniques are regarded as indispensable procedures in electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems, which can effectively compensate irreversible capacity loss, raise working voltage, and increase Li+/Na+ concentration in the electrolyte. Various prelithiation/presodiation methods have been successfully exploited and a revolutionary impact has been achieved through the utilization of prelithiation/presodiation techniques. It is well acknowledged that different prelithiation/presodiation strategies possess their own specific mechanisms, which play vital roles in the advancement of EES systems. However, there has rarely been systematical reviews about the concept and progress of prelithiation/presodiation techniques. Hence, in this review various prelithiation/presodiation approaches are comprehensively analyzed and summarized, and in-depth prelithiation/presodiation behaviors and other innovative applications (including optimization of separators, amelioration of binders, regeneration of spent batteries) are discussed in detail. Finally, suggested future directions of prelithiation/presodiation techniques are proposed and it is expected that these prelithiation/presodiation techniques could provide guidance for construction of advanced EES systems and propel the commercialization process with a focus on safety considerations.",Advanced Functional Materials

Electrocatalysts play a key role in the development of electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. Especially, developing efficient and cost-effective catalysts is important for the large-scale application of these devices. Among various electrocatalyst candidates, earth abundant transition metal compound (TMC)-based electrocatalysts are being widely and rapidly studied owing to their high electrocatalytic performances.

PAANa-induced ductile SEI of bare micro-sized FeS enables high sodium-ion storage performance PAANa粘结剂诱导形成柔韧固态电解质膜提升微米级FeS电极的储钠性能,"© 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.High-capacity metal chalcogenides often suffer from low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and serious capacity fading owing to the shuttle effect and volumetric expansion. Various carbon-coating and fixing methods were used to improve the above-mentioned performance. However, the synthesis processes of them are complex and time-consuming, limiting their engineering applications. Herein, polar polymer binder sodium polyacrylate (PAANa) is selected as an example to solve the problems of metal chalcogenides (bare micro-sized FeS) without any modification of the active materials. The special function of the polymer binder in the interface between the active material particles and the electrolytes demonstrates that a PAANa-induced network structure on the surface of ion sulfide microparticles not only buffers the mechanical stress of particles during discharging-charging, but also participates in forming a ductile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with high interfacial ion transportation and enhanced ICE. The cyclic stability and rate performance can be simultaneously improved. This work not only provides a new understanding of the binder on electrode, but also introduces a new way to improve the performance of batteries.",Science China Materials
Multifunctional LaF3 doped pomegranate-like porous carbon nanofibers with high-speed transfer channel and strong polar interface for high stability lithium sulfur battery,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Rational structure designs of cathodes with high electrical conductivity and strong interface adsorption to lithium polysulfide are a huge requirement for lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery. Herein, we report a multifunctional pomegranate-like porous carbon nanofibers with LaF3 doped (La@PCNFs) by electro-blowing spinning technique and subsequent one-step carbonization process for high stability Li-S battery. Interestingly, a number of hollow and mesoporous carbon grains with high graphitization evenly and densely grow inside the macroporous carbon skeleton, which can construct a fast and hierarchical transfer channel and largely enrich the exposed active sites. More importantly, the polar interfaces decorated with active ionic C-F and LaF3 nanocrystal have strong trapping to the lithium polysulfide during cycles. Therefore, the La@PCNFs cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 640 mAh·g−1 and a low average capacity decay of 0.05% during 1000 cycles at 5 C, which will shed some lights on the development of other biomimetic materials for various energy conversion and storage systems.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Inhibition of Polysulfide Shuttles in Li–S Batteries: Modified Separators and Solid-State Electrolytes,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are one of the most promising next-generation energy storage systems due to their ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity. However, their practical applications are seriously hindered by some inevitable disadvantages such as the insulative nature of sulfur and Li2S, volume expansion of the cathode, the shuttle effect of polysulfides, and the growth of lithium dendrites on the anode. Of these, the polysulfide shuttle effect is one of the most critical issues causing the irreversible loss of active materials and rapid capacity degradation of batteries. Herein, modified separators with functional coatings inhibiting the migration of polysulfides are enumerated based on three effects toward polysulfides: the adsorption effect, separation effect, and catalytic effect. To solve the shuttle effect problem, researchers have replaced liquid electrolytes with solid-state electrolytes. In this review, solid-state electrolytes for lithium–sulfur batteries are grouped into three categories: inorganic solid electrolytes, solid polymer electrolytes, and composite solid electrolytes. Challenges and perspectives regarding the development of an optimized strategy to inhibit the polysulfide shuttle for enhancing cycle stability in lithium–sulfur batteries are also proposed.",Advanced Energy Materials
A Strategy for Polysulfides/Polyselenides Protection Based on Co9S8@SiO2/C Host in Na-SeS2 Batteries,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimTo obtain unbroken sulfides with delicate morphology from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a method for in situ growth of SiO2 protective layers on the surface of MOFs is proposed. This strategy can be successfully expanded to a variety of MOFs (ZIF-67, Cu-MOF, ZIF-8, and PBA). Importantly, room-temperature Na-SeS2 batteries with Co9S8@SiO2/C prepared from ZIF-67 as cathode host are assembled. Due to the hollow structure that can relieve the volume expansion and the co-adsorption of sodium polysulfides/sodium polyselenides by Co9S8@SiO2/C, the SeS2/Co9S8@SiO2/C cathode shows excellent rate performance and Coulombic efficiency. In addition, ex situ X-ray diffraction and in situ Raman results show that S8 and Se8 are generated after the discharge of SeS2, and Se8 is preferentially oxidized during charging.",Advanced Functional Materials
Ambient-Temperature All-Solid-State Sodium Batteries with a Laminated Composite Electrolyte,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThis study presents a sodium-ion conductive laminated polymer/ceramic-polymer solid-state electrolyte for the development of room-temperature all-solid-state sodium batteries. At the negative electrode side, a negative-electrode-benign poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is used as a polymer matrix into which succinonitrile (SN) is integrated to improve the room-temperature Na+-ion conductivity. At the positive electrode side, a cathode-friendly poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) serves as a polymer matrix into which a NASICON-type ceramic solid-electrolyte (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) powder is incorporated toward both the enhancement of Na+-ion conductivity and the prevention of Na dendrite from penetrating through the electrolyte membrane. Through a strategical management of composition, the PAN-Na3Zr2Si2PO12-NaClO4 composite and the PEO-SN-NaClO4 polymer deliver a balanced Na+-ion conductivity. Combining the two electrolyte layers, the laminated PEO-SN-NaClO4/PAN-Na3Zr2Si2PO12-NaClO4 solid electrolyte provides a Na+-ion conductivity of 1.36 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. With respect to the anodic friendly feature of the PEO-SN-NaClO4 layer and the cathodic friendly feature of the PAN-Na3Zr2Si2PO12-NaClO4 layer, the laminated solid electrolyte presents a stable electrochemical window of 0–4.8 V. Room-temperature all-solid-state sodium batteries fabricated with the laminated solid electrolyte, a Na-metal negative electrode, and a Na2MnFe(CN)6 positive electrode exhibit remarkably stable cyclability.",Advanced Functional Materials
Investigations into Reactions between Sodium Metal and Na3PS4-xOxSolid-State Electrolytes: Enhanced Stability of the Na3PS3O Solid-State Electrolyte,"© 2020 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Understanding the interfacial reactions between sodium metal (SM) and the solid-state electrolyte (SSE) Na3PS4 (NPS) and its oxygen-doped derivatives, Na3PS4-xOx (NPSO), will help develop a strategy to stabilize the SM-SSE interface. Previous reports have demonstrated that NPS is a promising SSE due to its high ionic conductivity, but it is known to be unstable against SM. This chemical instability and hence reactivity are critical problems in most sulfide materials, and in this work, we report one of the very first detailed studies of the reaction between SM and NPSO SSEs. It was discovered that the reaction between SM and Na3PS4 is facilitated simply by contact and is not driven by a forced potential difference. A combination of powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy was used to identify the main reaction product as the reduced phosphide Na3P. Additionally, the reaction is significantly slowed but not completely eliminated by the addition of oxygen in NPSO oxy-sulfide SSEs. We find that NPS is unstable because the SM-NPS reaction layer product is heavily exfoliated, allowing further sodium reaction between the newly created sheets. This degradation mechanism results in further chemical reaction until either the metallic sodium or NPS SSE is fully consumed, whichever is the limiting reagent in the reaction. As oxygen is added, x > 0, the SSE surface remains dense and is slower to react, making it more difficult for the SM to react through the NPSO SSE. The central finding here is that in our work, we find that the x = 1 Na3PS3O SSE remains unreacted with SM over periods of months at room temperature and so far appears to be one of the very few sulfide-based SSEs that is stable against SM and as such is a highly promising SSE for all solid-state sodium batteries (ASSSBs).",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Lithium-Oxygen Battery Exploiting Highly Concentrated Glyme-Based Electrolytes,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Concentrated solutions of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium nitrate (LiNO3) salts in either diethylene-glycol dimethyl-ether (DEGDME) or triethylene-glycol dimethyl-ether (TREGDME) are herein characterized in terms of chemical and electrochemical properties in view of possible applications as the electrolyte in lithium-oxygen batteries. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy at the lithium metal surface upon prolonged storage in lithium cells reveals the complex composition and nature of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed through the reduction of the solutions, while thermogravimetric analysis shows a stability depending on the glyme chain length. The applicability of the solutions in the lithium metal cell is investigated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), chronoamperometry, galvanostatic cycling, and voltammetry, which reveal high conductivity and lithium transference number as well as a wide electrochemical stability window of both electrolytes. However, a challenging issue ascribed to the more pronounced evaporation of the electrolyte based on DEGDME with respect to TREGDME actually limits the application of the former in the Li/O2 battery. Hence, EIS measurements reveal a very fast increase in the impedance of cells using the DEGDME-based electrolyte upon prolonged exposure to the oxygen atmosphere, which leads to a performance decay of the corresponding Li/O2 battery. Instead, cells using the TREGDME-based electrolyte reveal remarkable interphase stability and much more enhanced response with specific capacity ranging from 500 to 1000 mA h g-1 referred to the carbon mass in the positive electrode, with an associated maximum practical energy density of 450 W h kg-1. These results suggest the glyme volatility as a determining factor for allowing the use of the electrolyte media in a Li/O2 cell. Therefore, electrolytes using a glyme with sufficiently high boiling point, such as TREGDME, which is further increased by the relevant presence of salts including a lithium protecting sacrificial one (LiNO3), can allow the application of the solutions in a safe and high-performance lithium-oxygen battery.",ACS Applied Energy Materials

Sodium-Based Batteries: In Search of the Best Compromise Between Sustainability and Maximization of Electric Performance,"© Copyright © 2020 Karabelli, Singh, Kiemel, Koller, Konarov, Stubhan, Miehe, Weeber, Bakenov and Birke.Till 2020 the predominant key success factors of battery development have been overwhelmingly energy density, power density, lifetime, safety, and costs per kWh. That is why there is a high expectation on energy storage systems such as lithium-air (Li-O2) and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) systems, especially for mobile applications. These systems have high theoretical specific energy densities compared to conventional Li-ion systems. If the challenges such as practical implementation, low energy efficiency, and cycle life are handled, these systems could provide an interesting energy source for EVs. However, various raw materials are increasingly under critical discussion. Though only 3 wt% of metallic lithium is present in a modern Li-ion cell, absolute high amounts of lithium demand will rise due to the fast-growing market for traction and stationary batteries. Moreover, many lithium sources are not available without compromising environmental aspects. Therefore, there is a growing focus on alternative technologies such as Na-ion and Zn-ion batteries. On a view of Na-ion batteries, especially the combination with carbons derived from food waste as negative electrodes may generate a promising overall cost structure, though energy densities are not as favorable as for Li-ion batteries. Within the scope of this work, the future potential of sodium-based batteries will be discussed in view of sustainability and abundance vs. maximization of electric performance. The major directions of cathode materials development are reviewed and the tendency towards designing high-performance systems is discussed. This paper provides an outlook on the potential of sodium-based batteries in the future battery market of mobile and stationary applications.",Frontiers in Energy Research
Accelerating hydrogen evolution in Ru-doped FeCoP nanoarrays with lattice distortion toward highly efficient overall water splitting,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Rationally designing bifunctional electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high activity and long term stability remains to be a big challenge. Herein, we report in situ synthesized uniform Ru-doped FeCoP (FeCoRuP) nanoarrays as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for highly efficient overall water splitting. The introduction of Ru modifies the electronic interaction between cation active sites due to the electronegativity difference, which also introduces more active sites by creating lattice defects and distortion. Benefiting from the rich active sites and the strong electronic interaction, the optimized Ru-doped FeCoP exhibits excellent HER activities (45 mV at 10 mA cm-2) and OER activity (214 mV at 20 mA cm-2), together with excellent long-term durability (110 h) in alkaline media. An overall water splitting cell in which both anode and cathode are composed of the FeCoRuP catalyst exhibits an ultralow voltage of 1.47 V at 10 mA cm-2, which is superior to the benchmark 20% Pt/C‖IrO2 electrodes (1.68 V at 10 mA cm-2). The present work offers a simple but effective approach to promote the overall water splitting performance of transition metal phosphides by modulating the electronic structure of active sites.

Hierarchical SnS2/carbon nanotube@reduced graphene oxide composite as an anode for ultra-stable sodium-ion batteries,"© 2020Ultrathin SnS2 layers with high theoretical specific capacity displays promising advantages as an anode in sodium storage systems. However, their poor conductivity and large capacity loss during charging/discharging process are urgently needed to be addressed. Herein, an exotic hierarchical SnS2/carbon nanotube@reduced graphene oxide (SnS2/CNT@rGO) composite has been designed and developed to be an anode for sodium-ion batteries. Functionally, the CNT penetrates into the petals of SnS2 micro-flowers to increase the conductivity of SnS2, while the three-dimensional rGO wraps around the SnS2/CNT composite to relieve the volume expansion of SnS2 during the charging/discharging process and construct “rGO conductive bridge” to accelerate electrode reaction kinetics.

Hierarchical porous carbon sheets for high-performance room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries: Integration of nitrogen-self-doping and space confinement,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries hold great promise for next generation high energy storage systems due to their high theoretical capacity and the low cost of both sodium and sulfur. However, the slow reaction kinetics and insulating properties of sulfur, and dissolution of sodium polysulfides seriously inhibit their practical applications. In this work, a nitrogen-self-doped porous carbon (NPC) sheet is prepared through facile self-assembly, followed by a pyrolysis/activation process, in which polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) simultaneously acts as a carbon and nitrogen source. Benefiting from the large specific surface area, abundant micro/nanoporous structure, and nitrogen-self-doping, the obtained NPC sheets can significantly boost space confinement for sulfur molecules and effectively alleviate the dissolution of sodium polysulfides during the charge-discharge process in RT Na-S batteries. As a result, the optimum sample (S@NPC-700) is used as the cathode of a RT Na-S battery, which delivers a specific capacity of 280.9 mA h g-1 (at 2.0C) and maintains a reversible capacity of 418.9 mA h g-1 at 0.5C after 400 cycles. The superior performance of the S@NPC-700 electrode can be attributed to the synergistic effect from the micro/nanoporosity of carbon sheets and nitrogen-self-doping.

Efficient suppression of the shuttle effect in Na-S batteries with an As2S3anchoring monolayer,"© 2020 the Owner Societies.Sodium-sulfur batteries (NaSBs) have emerged as a promising energy storage technology for large-scale stationary applications such as smart electrical grids due to their exceptionally high energy density and cost-effectiveness. However, one of the challenging problems impeding their practical applications is the sulfur shuttle effect by which the active redox intermediates are gradually dissolved in electrolytes. In this work, we have employed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to unravel the suppression of the shuttle effect in NaSBs with a two-dimensional (2D) As2S3 monolayer as the anchoring material. We show that semiconducting As2S3 is a suitable anchoring layer to inhibit the dissolution of the polysulfide intermediates in common electrolytes because of its stronger chemical binding with sodium polysulfides than with the electrolytes. The immense adsorption is attributed to the electron donation from the unfilled S-3p states of the polysulfides to As2S3. These mechanisms increase the carrier population and consequently improve the electrical conductivity of As2S3. Hence, the use of As2S3 can both reduce the shuttle effect and enhance the cathode electron conductivity to enable improved cycling stability and coulombic efficiency of the battery.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Rechargeable Aluminium–Sulfur Battery with Improved Electrochemical Performance by Cobalt-Containing Electrocatalyst,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe rechargeable aluminium–sulfur (Al–S) battery is regarded as a potential alternative beyond lithium-ion battery system owing to its safety, promising energy density, and the high earth abundance of the constituent electrode materials, however, sluggish kinetic response and short life-span are the major issues that limit the battery development towards applications. In this article, we report CoII,III as an electrochemical catalyst in the sulfur cathode that renders a reduced discharge–charge voltage hysteresis and improved capacity retention and rate capability for Al–S batteries. The structural and electrochemical analysis suggest that the catalytic effect of CoII,III is closely associated with the formation of cobalt sulfides and the changes in the valence states of the CoII,III during the electrochemical reactions of the sulfur species, which lead to improved reaction kinetics and sulfur utilization in the cathode. The Al–S battery, assembled with the cathode consisting of CoII,III decorated carbon matrix, demonstrates a considerably reduced voltage hysteresis of 0.8 V, a reversible specific capacity of ≈500 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 200 discharge–charge cycles and of ≈300 mAh g−1 at 3 A g−1.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition

The value of thermal management control strategies for battery energy storage in grid decarbonization: Issues and recommendations,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdDeeply decarbonizing electricity production will likely require low-carbon sources that meet energy demand throughout days, years, and decades. Renewable energy sources (RES) are possible low-carbon options, but the intermittency of RES can limit their potential as viable options. Energy storage can be a solution to this problem by storing excess power from RES and providing power to the load when output power of RES is insufficient. To date, some researchers have investigated the effect of energy storage on power system operations and their environmental impacts. However, the effects of battery thermal management (BTM) controller on the decarbonization of power grid are not sufficiently covered. Thus, this paper presents a comprehensive review on the benefits of thermal management control strategies for battery energy storage in the effort towards decarbonizing the power sector. In this regard, the impacts of BTM controller and optimized controller approaches in terms of cooling, heating, operation, insulation, and the pros and cons of each are reviewed and discussed. Additionally, the impact of batteries, BTM controller, and renewable energy integration towards grid decarbonization are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of various types of batteries concerning power density, normal temperature range, life-cycle, size, environmental impact, and toxic emission are also highlighted. This study also focuses on different issues and challenges related to the BTM as well as recommendations for future research. The review demonstrates that the existing BTM control techniques not only improve the batteries efficiency, but also reduce its environmental impacts. However, further enhancement of BTM control using optimization methods is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Besides, as the majority of current approaches are restricted to simulation analysis, experimental validation becomes necessary. In summary, this review will hopefully strengthen the efforts toward the development of clean power systems with less environmental impact toward grid decarbonization.",Journal of Cleaner Production

On-Site Fluorination for Enhancing Utilization of Lithium in a Lithium-Sulfur Full Battery,"© The rechargeability of the lithium anode in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is an issue for this type of battery. In this work, we demonstrate a Li-S full battery comprising a protected anode scaffold and a Li2S cathode. The stabilized performance is attained by an on-site fluorination strategy, using BiF3 for the interfacial coating of the anode. Unlike previously reported LiF protective coating derived from the vapor/solution depositions, BiF3 nanocrystals would be lithiated on-site to the anode surface and server as the protective layer. The chemically inertial Li3Bi alloy can provide additional ion-conductive paths and stitch the LiF to form a seamless protective layer, thereby suppressing the dendrite propagation and parasitic reactions effectively.

Recent progress on the design of hollow carbon spheres to host sulfur in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries 空心炭球在室温钠硫电池中的研究进展,"© 2020, Science Press. All right reserved.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries are an important class of rechargeable batteries with a high theoretical capacity of 1 675 mAh g-1 and energy density up to 1 276 Wh kg-1 (based on Na2S). They are recognized as attractive next-generation high-energy-density devices for large-scale energy storage owing to the abundance and low cost of sodium and sulfur. However, similar to the working principle in lithium-sulfur batteries, they suffer from some basic problems such as the poor conductivity of elemental sulfur, a large volume change during charge-discharge cycling and a serious shuttle effect caused by sodium polysulfide dissolution. Moreover, the shuttle effect and volume change seem more pronounced in RT-Na/S batteries, which further decreases their performance and seriously hinders the progress towards their practical application. A fast growth in designing porous carbons, especially hollow carbon spheres (HCSs), as a sulfur host to address these problems has been seen in recent years, due to their unique structural features such as a large void space, a permeable shell, and simple functionalization. This review summarizes recent progress in HCS-based materials as the sulfur hosts in RT-Na/S batteries. Beginning with a brief introduction to RT-Na/S batteries, carbon hosts and design strategies for preparing HCSs, particular emphasis is placed on manipulating the pore structure, heteroatom doping and decoration with metal species with the aim of alleviating the ""shuttle effect"" and thus improving the performance. Finally, perspectives on current challenges and future research directions are discussed.",Xinxing Tan Cailiao/New Carbon Materials
New High Donor Electrolyte for Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe unparalleled theoretical specific energy of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries has attracted considerable research interest from within the battery community. However, most of the long cycling results attained thus far relies on using a large amount of electrolyte in the cell, which adversely affects the specific energy of Li–S batteries. This shortcoming originates from the low solubility of polysulfides in the electrolyte. Here, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI) is reported as a new high donor electrolyte for Li–S batteries. The high solubility of polysulfides in DMI and its activation of a new reaction route, which engages the sulfur radical (S3•−), enables the efficient utilization of sulfur as reflected in the specific capacity of 1595 mAh g−1 under lean electrolyte conditions of 5 μLelectrolyte mgsulfur−1. Moreover, the addition of LiNO3 stabilizes the lithium metal interface, thereby elevating the cycling performance to one of the highest known for high donor electrolytes in Li–S cells. These engineered high donor electrolytes are expected to advance Li–S batteries to cover a wide range of practical applications, particularly by incorporating established strategies to realize the reversibility of lithium metal electrodes.",Advanced Materials
Unraveling the Nature of Excellent Potassium Storage in Small-Molecule Se@Peapod-Like N-Doped Carbon Nanofibers,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe potassium–selenium (K–Se) battery is considered as an alternative solution for stationary energy storage because of abundant resource of K. However, the detailed mechanism of the energy storage process is yet to be unraveled. Herein, the findings in probing the working mechanism of the K-ion storage in Se cathode are reported using both experimental and computational approaches. A flexible K–Se battery is prepared by employing the small-molecule Se embedded in freestanding N -doped porous carbon nanofibers thin film (Se@NPCFs) as cathode. The reaction mechanisms are elucidated by identifying the existence of short-chain molecular Se encapsulated inside the microporous host, which transforms to K2Se by a two-step conversion reaction via an “all-solid-state” electrochemical process in the carbonate electrolyte system. Through the whole reaction, the generation of polyselenides (K2Sen, 3 ≤ n ≤ 8) is effectively suppressed by electrochemical reaction dominated by Se2 molecules, thus significantly enhancing the utilization of Se and effecting the voltage platform of the K–Se battery. This work offers a practical pathway to optimize the K–Se battery performance through structure engineering and manipulation of selenium chemistry for the formation of selective species and reveal its internal reaction mechanism in the carbonate electrolyte.",Advanced Materials

Lewis Acid–Base Interactions between Polysulfides and Boehmite Enables Stable Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHRoom-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries are among the ideal candidates for grid-scale energy storage due to their high theoretical energy density. However, rapid dissolution of polysulfides along with extremely slow redox kinetics lead to a low practical cell capacity and inferior cycling stability, inhibiting their practical applications. Herein, an innovative design strategy is introduced for a chemical and structural synergistic immobilization of sodium-polysulfides in the cathode structure. An aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH) nanosheets decorated sulfur/carbon black nanocomposite (S@CB@AlOOH) is used as an efficient cathode material for stable RT Na–S batteries. The cathode material exhibits extremely stable cycling performance, delivering an initial specific capacity of 392 mA h g–1 and retains 378 mA h g–1 after 500 cycles at 1C. The excellent performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the structural encapsulation as well as chemical immobilization of polysulfides, significantly suppressing their gradual dissolution into liquid electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that through favorable Lewis acid–base interactions, AlOOH catalyzes the redox conversion of the higher-order polysulfides (Na2Sn, 6 ≤ n ≤ 8) to the lower-order polysulfides (Na2Sx, 1 ≤ x ≤ 2). The importance of Lewis acid–base catalysis to enhance the overall performance of these batteries is demonstrated.",Advanced Functional Materials

There have been significant achievements in the extensive investigations of potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). However, post-potassium-ion batteries (post-PIBs), including potassium–sulfur (K–S), potassium–selenium (K–Se), all-solid-state potassium-ion batteries (ASSPIBs), and aqueous potassium-ion batteries (APIBs) along with their respective advantages such as higher energy density, better safety, lower costs, and higher power density, are still in the initial stages of research and require further attention. Therefore, this review summarizes the recent progress, current challenges, and advancements in post-PIBs such as K–S/Se batteries and ASSPIBs. Additionally, the challenges and solutions of using K metal in such systems are discussed. Thereafter, smart designs for electrodes and electrolytes, along with rational constructions for obtaining desirable APIBs are evaluated.

An organic nickel salt-based electrolyte additive boosts homogeneous catalysis for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.The shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) intermediates bottlenecks practical uses of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. A commercial organometallic salt, nickel chloride dimethoxyethane adduct (NiDME), is introduced as the homogenous catalyst dissolved in the electrolyte to suppress the shuttle effect. A very small amount of catalyst (only 0.5 wt% additive relative to the electrolyte) brings the battery capacity a big rise from 408 to 784 mAh g−1 over 500 cycles at 1 C. More promisingly, the required amount of electrolyte is greatly reduced, and the battery works well with a lean electrolyte (5 μL(electrolyte)/mg(sulfur)). The improved performance is attributed to the catalyst-accelerated LiPS conversion which is characterized by largely decreased activation energy (Ea) of the sulfur redox reaction, especially for Li2S deposition, and much reduced accumulation of LiPSs intermediates. Specially, the NiDME additive captures LiPSs in the electrolyte, accelerates the redox reactions homogeneously and regulates a uniform and fast deposition of Li2S, all these contributing to a perfect catalytic cycle with less LiPS shuttling. This work deepens our understanding on catalysis in accelerating sulfur redox conversion and indicates homogeneous catalysis as a simple yet fundamental solution to shuttle effect of LiPSs intermediates, which boosts practical Li-S batteries with less electrolyte needs and long working life.",Energy Storage Materials
Nitrogen-doped graphene-wrapped Cu2S as a superior anode in sodium-ion batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been attracting an ever-growing research interest, mainly ascribed to their cost-effectiveness. However, SIBs have been significantly hindered by lack of a suitable anode. Herein, an exceptional Cu2S-based composite anode is developed via a facile ball-milling method, in which Cu2S particles are wrapped by nitrogen-doped graphene sheets (Cu2S@NG). This Cu2S@NG composite anode enables extremely long cycling life, ultra-stable cyclability with high capacity, and excellent rate capability. The superior performance of the Cu2S@NG composite is owing to its intriguing core-shell structure and the exceptional properties of both the Cu2S and NG. In this study, it is found that the NG shell yields multiple merits in improving the performance of Cu2S: (i) mitigating the loss of active materials, (ii) constituting a stable interface, (iii) providing improved electrical conductivity and good ionic transfer, and (iv) enhancing mechanical integrity. Additionally, the vital effects of different voltage windows and a surface coating via atomic layer deposition on further enhancing performance are clarified. Significantly, the electrochemical mechanism of Cu2S during sodiation/desodiation is unveiled using advanced synchrotron-based in-situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy. This work represents a great advance in seeking high-performance anodes in SIBs.",Carbon
Evaluation on hybrid−electrolyte structure using the liquid electrolyte interlayer containing LiBH4 at Li7La3Zr2O12 | Li interface at high operating temperature,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Li metal battery with garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZ) as a solid electrolyte has attracted attentions as a promising candidate for high-energy batteries. However, the interfacial resistance between LLZ and Li is huge due to a point-point contact, leading to poor battery performances such as rate capability and cycleability. Here, we have studied the hybrid-electrolyte structure using the liquid electrolyte interlayer containing LiBH4 between LLZ and Li at high operating temperature of 120 °C. This hybrid-electrolyte structure offers high current density usage and a long-term cycleability. The Li|LLZ|Li symmetric cell shows high critical current density of 13 mA cm−2 and a long term cycle. The liquid electrolyte interlayer containing LiBH4 provides an improved coulombic efficiency of Li striping/plating due to an excellent reductive stability. Our findings suggest that the interfacial conditions on LLZ|Li could be effectively improved by using the modified liquid electrolyte interlayer.",Journal of Power Sources
Coordination engineering of iridium nanocluster bifunctional electrocatalyst for highly efficient and pH-universal overall water splitting,"© 2020, The Author(s).Water electrolysis offers a promising energy conversion and storage technology for mitigating the global energy and environmental crisis, but there still lack highly efficient and pH-universal electrocatalysts to boost the sluggish kinetics for both cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report uniformly dispersed iridium nanoclusters embedded on nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene as an efficient and robust electrocatalyst for both HER and OER at all pH conditions, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with only 300, 190 and 220 mV overpotential for overall water splitting in neutral, acidic and alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Based on probing experiments, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we attribute the high catalytic activities to the optimum bindings to hydrogen (for HER) and oxygenated intermediate species (for OER) derived from the tunable and favorable electronic state of the iridium sites coordinated with both nitrogen and sulfur.",Nature Communications
Iron phthalocyanine with coordination induced electronic localization to boost oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2020, The Author(s).Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) is a promising non-precious catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Unfortunately, FePc with plane-symmetric FeN4 site usually exhibits an unsatisfactory ORR activity due to its poor O2 adsorption and activation. Here, we report an axial Fe–O coordination induced electronic localization strategy to improve its O2 adsorption, activation and thus the ORR performance. Theoretical calculations indicate that the Fe–O coordination evokes the electronic localization among the axial direction of O–FeN4 sites to enhance O2 adsorption and activation. To realize this speculation, FePc is coordinated with an oxidized carbon. Synchrotron X-ray absorption and Mössbauer spectra validate Fe–O coordination between FePc and carbon. The obtained catalyst exhibits fast kinetics for O2 adsorption and activation with an ultralow Tafel slope of 27.5 mV dec−1 and a remarkable half-wave potential of 0.90 V. This work offers a new strategy to regulate catalytic sites for better performance.",Nature Communications
Freestanding agaric-like molybdenum carbide/graphene/N-doped carbon foam as effective polysulfide anchor and catalyst for high performance lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Developing high energy density lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries mainly relies on the design of the electrode matrix which can accommodate high sulfur loading and still remain high utilization of active materials. Herein, a 3D hierarchical graphitic carbon foam supported graphene@Mo2C (GCF-G@Mo2C) heterostructure is introduced as a freestanding electrode for Li–S batteries with a facile and cost-effective method. The N-doped carbon foam wrapped by graphene sheets with agaric-like porous structure could promote fast electron and ion transport, meanwhile effectively anchor the polysulfides through physical confinement and chemical adsorption by strongly polar-polar interactions. More importantly, the Mo2C nanoparticles can act as the chemical anchoring center to provide strong polysulfide adsorption, as testified by experimental data and first-principle calculations. Moreover, the catalytic effect of Mo2C also accelerates the redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion, contributing to enhanced rate performance. As a result, the cell with GCF-G@Mo2C displays an initial capacity as high as 862 mAh g−1 and a retained capacity of 597 mAh g−1 after 600 cycles with only 0.051% capacity fade per cycle at 1C rate, presenting good cycling stability. In addition, the GCF-G@Mo2C substrate with high sulfur content (70 ​wt%) and sulfur loading (10.5 ​mg ​cm−2) achieves an ultra-high areal capacity of 12.6 mAh cm−2 at 0.1 ​C, offering a competitive cathode for high-performance Li–S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Polymer electrolytes and interfaces toward solid-state batteries: Recent advances and prospects,"© 2020Solid-state batteries (SSBs) are considered to be promising next-generation energy storage devices owing to their enhanced safety and energy density. However, the practical application of SSBs has been hampered by the crucial solid-solid electrolyte-electrode interfacial issues, especially in inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) with high ionic conductivity. Compared to ISEs, polymer electrolytes (PEs) can alleviate the tough interface issues due to their inherently competitive interface property, and promote the real application of SSBs along with their enhanced ionic conductivity.

Remarkable cycling durability of lithium-sulfur batteries with interconnected mesoporous hollow carbon nanospheres as high sulfur content host,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.To reduce capacity attenuation during cycling and improve ultrahigh-sulfur-loading of Li-S batteries, we have manufactured nitrogen doped hollow carbon nanospheres (60 nm) with interconnected mesoporous shell (MHCS) as conducting frameworks for sulfur loading. One-step dual template technique is employed to prepare nitrogen doped polymer-silica nanocomposites with “interpenetration twins” nano-architectures at the initial stage. After carbonization and etching of silica, the “interpenetration twins” nano-architectures converted into interconnected functionalized mesoporous carbon nanospheres that endow desired micro-mesoporous volume (4.75 cm3/g) and high-specific area (SBET, 1875 m2/g). To the best of our knowledge, we achieved the highest sulfur content (90.4 wt%) in the carbon-based cathodes due to the interlinked pore network between S and carbon skeleton, which is formed by occupying the space of the removed silica with sulfur. In this way sulfur element could be closely contacted with the conductive carbon skeleton. Furthermore, polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) composite polymer were adhesive on the encapsulated carbon shell to limit the leakage of lithium sulfide leading to an improved the capacity retention of Li-S batteries. Noticeably, the average of the capacity decay reached to 0.023% per cycle during 3,100 cycles, which represent optimal performance of long-period lithium-sulfur batteries heretofore. The effortless method can provide a new way to design exceptionally high pore volume with interconnected mesoporous, and maintained definite hollow nanostructure, which are critical for porous carbons and energy storage.",Chemical Engineering Journal

The difficulty of obtaining suitable electrode materials capable of storing large amount of Na-ion arises from the large radius of Na-ion that restricts its reversible capacity. Herein, Mn2O3 powders are synthesised through the thermal conversion of MnCO3 and reported for the first time as an anode for Na-ion batteries. The phase, morphology and charge/discharge characteristics of Mn2O3 obtained are evaluated systematically. The cubic-like Mn2O3 with particle sizes approximately 1.0–1.5 µm coupled with the formation of Mn2O3 sub-units on its surface create a positive effect on the insertion/deinsertion of Na-ion. Mn2O3 delivers a first discharge capacity of 544 mAh g−1 and retains its capacity by 85% after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1, demonstrating the excellent cyclability of the Mn2O3 electrode. Therefore, this study provides a significant contribution towards exploring the potential of Mn2O3 as a promising anode in the development of Na-ion batteries.",Scientific Reports

Atomically dispersed cobalt catalyst anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets for lithium-oxygen batteries,"© 2020, The Author(s).Developing single-site catalysts featuring maximum atom utilization efficiency is urgently desired to improve oxidation-reduction efficiency and cycling capability of lithium-oxygen batteries. Here, we report a green method to synthesize isolated cobalt atoms embedded ultrathin nitrogen-rich carbon as a dual-catalyst for lithium-oxygen batteries. The achieved electrode with maximized exposed atomic active sites is beneficial for tailoring formation/decomposition mechanisms of uniformly distributed nano-sized lithium peroxide during oxygen reduction/evolution reactions due to abundant cobalt-nitrogen coordinate catalytic sites, thus demonstrating greatly enhanced redox kinetics and efficiently ameliorated over-potentials. Critically, theoretical simulations disclose that rich cobalt-nitrogen moieties as the driving force centers can drastically enhance the intrinsic affinity of intermediate species and thus fundamentally tune the evolution mechanism of the size and distribution of final lithium peroxide. In the lithium-oxygen battery, the electrode affords remarkably decreased charge/discharge polarization (0.40 V) and long-term cyclability (260 cycles at 400 mA g−1).",Nature Communications

Template-guided synthesis of porous MoN microrod as an effective sulfur host for high-performance Lithium–Sulfur batteries,"© 2020Exploiting a sulfur host with strong immobilization and catalysis effects on soluble polysulfide is central for developing advanced lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. On this basis, a molybdenum nitride (MoN) microrod was fabricated using the one-pot ammoniation strategy of metal-oxide template. After the sulfur-melting permeation, rod-like architecture, which was assembled by confining the sulfur in a porous MoN microrod (MoN–S), was successfully achieved. When used as a cathode material for Li–S batteries, the as-prepared MoN–S could deliver an initial discharge capacity of as high as 1315 mAh g−1 and maintain a reversible capacity of 902 mAh g−1 after 350 cycles when a high areal loading of 3.1 mg cm−2 was applied.

Metal-organic framework-derived nitrogen-doped cobalt nanocluster inlaid porous carbon as high-efficiency catalyst for advanced potassium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Despite high theoretical capacity and earth-abundant resources, the potential industrialization of potassium-sulfur (K-S) batteries is severely plagued by poor electrochemical reaction kinetics and a parasitic shuttle effect. Herein, a facile low-temperature pyrolysis strategy is developed to synthesize N-doped Co nanocluster inlaid porous N-doped carbon derived from ZIF-67 as catalytic cathodes for K-S batteries. To maximize the utilization efficiency, the size of Co nanoparticles can be tuned from 7 nm to homogeneously distributed 3 nm clusters to create more active sites to regulate affinity for S/polysulfides, improving the conversion reaction kinetics between captured polysulfides and K2S3/S, fundamentally suppressing the shuttle effect. Cyclic voltammetry curves, Tafel plots, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations ascertain that 3 nm Co clusters in S-N-Cos-C cathodes exhibit superior catalytic activity to ensure low charge transfer resistance and energy barriers, enhanced exchange current density, and improved conversion reaction rate. The constructed S-N-Cos-C cathode delivers a superior reversible capacity of 453 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 after 50 cycles, a dramatic rate capacity of 415 mAh g-1 at 400 mA g-1, and a long cycling stability.

Herein, a slope-dominated mechanism strategy has been designed by preparing hybrid nanostructure carbon materials (HNCs) using a CVD-like method, providing hard carbon with excellent rate performances and high average discharge potential as an anode for Na-ion batteries. The HNCs integrate the advantages of carbon nanotubes and carbon nanosheets, presenting short ion/electron transfer distance and high surface area for abundant active sites. In addition, their microstructural properties including disorder degree and existing state of heteroatom sulfur, can be regulated via different synthetic temperatures providing effective nanovoids and bonding sites. Based on the reaction kinetics analysis, the Na-ion storage mechanism of HNCs can be determined as a capacitive-controlled process, which is essential for improving rate performances.

Tailoring binder-cathode interactions for long-life room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries (NaSBs) are well poised as candidates for next-generation battery applications. However, two important limitations must first be overcome: irreversible capacity loss from long-chain polysulfide dissolution and cathode pulverization from severe volume expansion. Although covalent-sulfur composites like sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (S-PAN) prevent polysulfide dissolution, they do not address the latter issue of sustaining the cathode structure during the sodiation reaction. In this work, we demonstrate that the unique interactions between polar binders and insoluble short-chain sulfur species can be exploited as a strategy to solve both challenges concurrently. Our hypothesis is that specific polar groups, like the carboxyl moiety, interact strongly with sodium sulfide and short-chain polysulfides, as compared to traditional fluoropolymer binders employed in most sulfur-based cathodes. Binder-cathode interactions were first predicted for sodium-sulfur batteries using theoretical calculations, and then confirmed experimentally using a polyacrylic acid (PAA) binder, in combination with a S-PAN cathode. This strategy can be further generalized to other carboxyl binder systems, as demonstrated using two additional binders derived from natural products. Compared to conventional polyvinylidene difluoride-based cathodes experiencing large initial capacity losses, the PAA-based S-PAN cathode delivered a long 1000 cycle lifetime with initial and final discharge capacities of 1195 and 1000 mA h g(S)-1 respectively, representing a low capacity loss of 0.016% per cycle. Rational design of NaSBs based on the synergistic interactions between insoluble sulfur species and carboxyl-binders allows us to overcome key challenges to their practical development.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

Manganese dioxide nanosheet functionalized reduced graphene oxide as a compacted cathode matrix for lithium-sulphur batteries with a low electrolyte/sulphur ratio,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulphur (Li-S) batteries are interesting due to their high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, their commercial implementation is impeded by the lack of suitable sulphur cathodes that have high electrochemical stability and high sulphur loading using a low electrolyte/sulphur ratio. In this work, reduced graphene oxide functionalized with MnO2 nanosheets was demonstrated as a sulphur cathode (MnO2@rGO/S). The high polarity of the MnO2 nanosheets grown on the rGO surface is beneficial for the uniform distribution of sulphur, providing access to Li+ and immobilizing polysulfides in the cathode region. This leads to an improved electrolyte wettability, promoted sulphur utilization and enhanced reaction kinetics. As a result, the obtained cathode enables superior cyclability over 500 cycles with a capacity fading rate of only 0.034% per cycle. Moreover, a sulphur content of 70 wt% with an electrolyte/sulphur ratio of 4 μL mg-1 is achieved, and the volumetric energy density at the cell level is more than 188 W h L-1 at 1.34 mA cm-2 using Li-metal as the anode.

Highly Reversible Na-Intercalation into Graphite Recovered from Spent Li–Ion Batteries for High-Energy Na-Ion Capacitor,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHHigh-performance Na-ion capacitor (NIC) was constructed with graphite recovered from spent Li-ion batteries (LIBs) as battery-type negative electrode and high-surface-area activated carbon as a supercapacitor component. Unlike Li-insertion into graphite, Na-insertion into graphite is extremely limited; hence, a “solvent-co-intercalation” mechanism was proposed for high reversibility using ether family solvents. First, the Na-insertion properties were assessed in the half-cell assembly with 0.5 m NaPF6 in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether as an electrolyte solution and compared with the commercial graphite. The NIC comprised pre-sodiated graphite as a negative electrode and commercial activated carbon as a cathode. This fascinating NIC configuration displayed the maximum energy density of 59.93 Wh kg−1 with exceptional cyclability of 5000 cycles at ambient temperature with approximately 98 % retention. Interestingly, the electrode aging process in the presence of electrolyte resulted in approximately 19 % higher energy density than the routine electrode heat treatment. Further, the electrochemical activity of the NIC at various temperatures was studied, and it was found that the graphite recovered from spent LIBs could be effectively reused towards the construction of high-performance charge storage devices with exceptional performance.",ChemSusChem
Coordinating Adsorption and Catalytic Activity of Polysulfide on Hierarchical Integrated Electrodes for High-Performance Flexible Li-S Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been known to be a promising substitute because of their much higher theoretical energy density than that of traditional Li-ion batteries. However, the low utilization of sulfur caused by the poor conductivity of sulfur and shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) severely restrict the commercial application of Li-S batteries, especially in flexible wearable devices. Herein, a hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT)@Co-Co3O4nanowire array (NWA)-integrated electrode was developed based on the rational design of density functional theory calculations, which shows simultaneous confinement adsorption and catalysis conversion of LiPSs. In situ Raman spectra further proved that the NCNT@Co-Co3O4NWAs exhibit sufficient adsorption capacity and high catalytic conversion of LiPSs. As a result, the NCNT@Co-Co3O4@S electrode exhibited the desirable specific capacity and excellent cyclic stability at both low and high sulfur loadings. Moreover, pouch cells with the NCNT@Co-Co3O4@S cathode show higher capacity under flat or bending states and longer cycle stability than that of the reported results. This work provides a new approach for the development of high-performance Li-S batteries toward future wearable electronics.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Superior anchoring of sodium polysulfides to the polar C2N 2D material: A potential electrode enhancer in sodium-sulfur batteries,"© Despite the high theoretical specific energy in rechargeable sodium-sulfur batteries, the shuttle effect severely hampers its capacity and reversibility, which could be overcome by introducing an anchoring material. We, herein, use first-principles calculations to study the low-cost, easily synthesized, environmentally friendly, and stable two-dimensional polar nitrogenated holey graphene (C2N) and nonpolar polyaniline (C3N) to investigate their performance as anchoring materials and the mechanism behind the binding to identify the best candidate to improve the performance of sodium-sulfur batteries. We gain insight into the interaction, including the lowest-energy configurations, binding energies, binding nature, charge transfer, and electronic properties. Sodium primarily contributes to binding with the nanosheets, which is in accordance with their characteristics as anchoring materials. Sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) and the S8 cluster adsorb at the pores of C2N, where there are six electron lone pairs, one for each N atom. The polar C2N binds the NaPSs much strongly than the nonpolar C3N. In contrast to C3N, the charge population substantially modifies by adsorbing NaPSs on C2N, with a substantial charge transfer from the sulfur atoms. The calculated work function of 6.04 eV for pristine C2N, comparable with the previously reported values, decreases on adsorption of the NaPSs formed from battery discharging. We suggest that the inclusion of C2N into sulfur electrodes could also improve their issue with poor conductivity.",Langmuir
Pulse discharging of sodium-oxygen batteries to enhance cathode utilization,"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Using sodium metal in sodium-oxygen batteries with aprotic electrolyte enables achieving a very high theoretical energy density. However, the promised values for energy density and capacity are not met in practical studies yet due to poor utilization of the void space in the cathode during battery discharge. In this work, we achieve better cathode utilization and higher discharge capacities by using pulse discharging. We optimize the chosen resting-to-pulse times, the applied current density, and elucidate that three-dimensional cathode materials yield higher capacities compared to two-dimensional ones. By implication, the pulse discharging mode ensures better supply with dissolved oxygen within the cathode. The higher amount of dissolved oxygen accumulated during the resting period after a current pulse is essential to form more of the discharge product, i.e., the metal oxide sodium superoxide. Interestingly, we show for the first time that the superoxide is deposited in a very unusual form of stacked and highly oriented crystal layers. Our findings on the pulse discharging can be transferred to other metal-oxygen battery systems and might assist in achieving their full potential regarding practical energy density.",Energies
Dual effect of MgS addition on li2s ionic conductivity and all-solid-state Li–S cell performance,"© 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.The effect of a multivalence cation, i.e. Mg2+, on both the ionic conductivity of Li2-2xMgxS (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) and the all-solid-state Li–S cell performance employing Li2−2xMgxS as an active material is investigated. MgS was added to Li2S (Li2−2xMgxS) using the planetary ball milling method. No trace of MgS was detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with x ≤ 0.05. Improvement of the ionic conductivity upon addition of MgS was observed even in the samples with 0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.2, where the remaining MgS was detected by XRD analysis. Vacancy formation and the nanoionic effect were the governing factors for Li+ conduction. Stabilization of the cycle capacity was also achieved in the cell containing Li1.7Mg0.15S when compared with that employing bare Li2S as the electrode active material. Improvement of the ionic conductivity by approximately 2 orders of magnitude at 90 °C was obtained with x = 0.15 compared with that with x = 0. In addition, the charge–discharge capacities of the cell with x = 0.15 were stable up to 50 cycles, while the cell with x = 0 began to degrade after the 25th cycle.",SN Applied Sciences
Revitalising sodium-sulfur batteries for non-high-temperature operation: A crucial review,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Rechargeable sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries are regarded as a promising energy storage technology due to their high energy density and low cost. High-temperature sodium-sulfur (HT Na-S) batteries with molten sodium and sulfur as cathode materials were proposed in 1966, and later successfully commercialised for utility-scale stationary energy storage. However, their high working temperature (300-350 °C) causes some detrimental problems such as high operating costs, difficulties of maintenance (corrosion), and severe safety issues. In particular, HT Na-S batteries with Na polysulfides as the final discharge product only deliver about a third of the sulfur's theoretical capacity. These drawbacks greatly limited the broader applications of HT Na-S batteries. In recent years, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing next-generation intermediate-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries (IMT Na-S, operating at 120-300 °C) and room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries (RT Na-S) with higher capacity, lower maintenance cost and enhanced safety. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the latest progress on IMT Na-S and RT Na-S batteries. We elucidate the working principles, opportunities and challenges of these non-high-temperature Na-S battery systems, and summarise the advances in the battery components including cathodes, anodes, electrolytes, and other battery constituents. In particular, the applications of solid-state electrolytes in IMT Na-S and RT Na-S chemistry are emphasised. The remaining challenges and clear perspectives are outlined for the future development of novel high-performance Na-S batteries.",Energy and Environmental Science
Advances in the chemistry and applications of alkali-metal–gas batteries,"© 2020, Springer Nature Limited.Rechargeable metal–gas batteries have the promise of exceeding the energy densities of Li-ion batteries. An archetypal metal–gas system is the nonaqueous lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) battery, which was developed with a view to deploying it in electric vehicles. However, operating this battery comes with substantial challenges that include parasitic chemical reactivity and degrees of electrochemical irreversibility, which contribute to poor charging and cycling. To address these challenges, researchers began exploring new nonaqueous metal–gas battery paradigms by manipulating the underlying O2 redox behaviour through electrolyte and materials design, using non-Li-metal anodes to change the nature of the solid discharge phase and improve reversibility, and using other gaseous reactants as the cathode. This Review presents the new understanding of nonaqueous gas-to-solid electrochemistry that has emerged from these concerted efforts, along with new hurdles that have been revealed as cells have gradually been reformulated. The ultimate impact of new metal–gas batteries needs to be re-examined for applications beyond electric vehicles that are more amenable to the individual chemistries and performance characteristics.

Role of Li-Ion Depletion on Electrode Surface: Underlying Mechanism for Electrodeposition Behavior of Lithium Metal Anode,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH GmbHThe application of lithium metal as an anode material for next generation high energy-density batteries has to overcome the major bottleneck that is the seemingly unavoidable growth of Li dendrites caused by non-uniform electrodeposition on the electrode surface. This problem must be addressed by clarifying the detailed mechanism. In this work the mass-transfer of Li-ions is investigated, a key process controlling the electrochemical reaction. By a phase field modeling approach, the Li-ion concentration and the electric fields are visualized to reveal the role of three key experimental parameters, operating temperature, Li-salt concentration in electrolyte, and applied current density, on the microstructure of deposited Li. It is shown that a rapid depletion of Li-ions on electrode surface, induced by, e.g., low operating temperature, diluted electrolyte and a high applied current density, is the underlying driving force for non-uniform electrodeposition of Li. Thus, a viable route to realize a dendrite-free Li plating process would be to mitigate the depletion of Li-ions on the electrode surface. The methodology and results in this work may boost the practical applicability of Li anodes in Li metal batteries and other battery systems using metal anodes.",Advanced Energy Materials

Rechargeable Battery Electrolytes Capable of Operating over Wide Temperature Windows and Delivering High Safety,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHLi-ion batteries (LIBs) are the energy storage systems of choice for portable electronics and electric vehicles. Due to the growing deployment of energy storage solutions, LIBs are increasingly required to function safely and steadily over a broad range of operational conditions. However, the conventional electrolytes used in LIBs will malfunction when the temperatures fall below zero or elevate above 60 °C. Further, conventional electrolytes are toxic and flammable, leading to severe safety risks, especially in the case of an accident or overheating. Therefore, an ever-growing body of research has been dedicated to the development of electrolytes characterized by high ionic conductivity, excellent electrochemical stability, and operability over a wide temperature range. In this Progress Report, the optimization of liquid-based electrolytes achieved by controlling Li salts, functional additives, and solvents is discussed first. Next, gel-polymer and all-solid-state electrolytes (i.e., ceramics, polymers, and their composites) are presented. Examples of advanced batteries (Li/Na/Zn-ion batteries and Li-metal batteries) capable of working over a broad temperature window are highlighted. Morever, recent computational studies aimed at designing and understanding electrolytes are reviewed.

Hollow Rutile Cuboid Arrays Grown on Carbon Fiber Cloth as a Flexible Electrode for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHFlexible electrodes with high charge storage capacity, low solid-state diffusion resistance toward charges, and excellent mechanical properties are needed for fabricating flexible energy storage devices. In this paper, an approach is described to synthesize a composite material with hollow rutile TiO2 cuboid arrays supported on carbon fiber cloth (H-TiO2@CFC). This composite material is used as a self-supporting and binder-free anode for sodium-ion storage, delivering reversible charge capacities of 287.3 at 0.1 C and 103.3 mAh g−1 at 50 C, respectively. The observed excellent electrochemical performance of the H-TiO2@CFC electrode is mainly attributed to its unique architecture, which facilitates ion transport, improves electron conductivity, and enables active surface reactivity toward sodium ions. In situ X-ray diffraction characterization results reveal a nearly zero strain structure of the hollow rutile TiO2 in H-TiO2@CFC against electrochemical cycling. An analysis of the charge storage mechanism reveals a significant pseudocapacitance contribution to the charge storage, accounting for the observed high-rate performance of the electrode. A flexible full cell fabricated with the H-TiO2@CFC as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode exhibits both excellent electrochemical properties and flexibility against mechanical deformation, demonstrating the great promise of the H-TiO2@CFC composite material for flexible battery cells.",Advanced Functional Materials
Recent progress on FeS2 as anodes for metal-ion batteries,"© 2020, The Nonferrous Metals Society of China and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Abstract: The ever-growing demand for advanced battery technologies with high energy and power density, high security, prolonged cycle life, and sustainably low cost requires the development of novel electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), as well as the alternative electrochemical energy storage technologies of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) for their abundant alkali metal elements resources. Among various anode materials, such as graphite, organic compounds, metal oxides, and chalcogenides, iron sulfides have attracted substantial interests for their high theoretical capacity and low price. Specifically, as a common mineral that has been already applied as electrode for primary battery, ferrous disulfide (FeS2) has been regarded as one of the promising candidate anode materials and studied widely. Unfortunately, there are some inherent problems handicapping its practical application for alkali-ion batteries, including limited ionic/electrical conductivity, the formation of soluble polysulfides, and large volume change. In the last decade, massive efforts have been devoted to solving those problems. In this review, the various synthesis strategies, the effect of morphologies and particle sizes, the energy storage mechanisms, and the electrochemical performances of FeS2 as anode for alkali-ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs, and PIBs) are summarized. Furthermore, the existing challenges and prospects of the development of FeS2-based anode materials for alkali-ion batteries are presented at last.

"Synthesis and performance evaluation of Na(2-x)LixFeP2O7 (x=0, 0.6) hybrid cathodes","© 2020 The Authors.This study reports hybrid cathodes formation by cation substitution in which Li+ substitution has been considered for Na+ in the structure of Na(2-x)LixFeP2O7 (x=0, 0.6) to form Na1.4Li0.6FeP2O7 cathodes. Na(2-x)LixFeP2O7 (x=0, 0.6) cathodes were synthesized using the solid-state synthesis technique and characterized by various methods. The structural analysis (XRD, FE-SEM) indicates that the submicron-sized, phase pure, and crystalline materials having irregular morphology have been developed. Moreover, Li+ substitution does not alter the triclinic parent structure of Na2FeP2O7. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that Li+ substitution into Na2FeP2O7 improves its thermal stability up to 550 °C with only ∼5% and Na1.4Li0.6FeP2O7 in both lithium (Li) and sodium (Na) half-cells is investigated using different electrochemical techniques. It is noticed that Na1.4Li0.6FeP2O7 is electrochemically active both in lithium (Li) and sodium (Na) cells with promising cyclability. However, compared with Na2FeP2O7, Na1.4Li0.6FeP2O7 suffers from inferior electrochemical performance, which might be associated with the lattice distortion of Na2FeP2O7 due to Li+ substitution having a lower ionic radius than the Na+. Considering Na2FeP2O7 as a baseline material, a new hybrid Na1.4Li0.6FeP2O7 cathode has been developed, which can be used to synthesize other new cathode materials with improved performance.",ChemistrySelect
Janus conductive/insulating microporous ion-sieving membranes for stable Li-S batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur batteries are one of the most promising next-generation high-density energy storage systems. Despite progress, the poor electrical conductivity and cycling stability of sulfur cathodes still hinder their practical implementation. Here, we developed a facile approach for the engineering of Janus double-sided conductive/insulating microporous ion-sieving membranes that significantly enhance recharge efficiency and long-term stability of Li-S batteries. Our membrane consists of an insulating Li-anode side and an electrically conductive S-cathode side. The insulating side consists of a standard polypropylene separator, while the conductive side is made of closely packed multilayers of highaspect- ratio MOF/graphene nanosheets having a thickness of few nanometers and a specific surface area of 996 m2 g-1 (MOF, metal-organic framework). Our models and experiments reveal that this electrically conductive microporous nanosheet architecture enables the reuse of polysulfide trapped in the membrane and decreases the polysulfide flux and concentration on the anode side by a factor of 250× over recent microporous membranes made of granular MOFs and standard battery separators. Notably, Li-S batteries using our Janus microporous membranes achieve an outstanding rate capability and longterm stability with 75.3% capacity retention over 1700 cycles. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our high-aspect-ratio MOF/graphene nanosheet preparation strategy by the synthesis of a diverse range of MOFs, including ZIF-67, ZIF-8, HKUST- 1, NiFe-BTC, and Ni-NDC, providing a flexible approach for the design of Janus microporous membranes and electrically conductive microporous building blocks for energy storage and various other electrochemical applications.",ACS Nano
Production of quasi-2d platelets of nonlayered iron pyrite (FeS2) by liquid-phase exfoliation for high performance battery electrodes,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Over the past 15 years, two-dimensional (2D) materials have been studied and exploited for many applications. In many cases, 2D materials are formed by the exfoliation of layered crystals such as transitionmetal disulfides. However, it has recently become clear that it is possible to exfoliate nonlayered materials so long as they have a nonisotropic bonding arrangement. Here, we report the synthesis of 2D-platelets from the earthabundant, nonlayered metal sulfide, iron pyrite (FeS2), using liquid-phase exfoliation. The resultant 2D platelets exhibit the same crystal structure as bulk pyrite but are surface passivated with a density of 14 × 1018 groups/m2. They form stable suspensions in common solvents and can be size-selected and liquid processed. Although the platelets have relatively low aspect ratios (∼5), this is in line with the anisotropic cleavage energy of bulk FeS2. We observe size-dependent changes to optical properties leading to spectroscopic metrics that can be used to estimate the dimensions of platelets. These platelets can be used to produce lithium ion battery anodes with capacities approaching 1000 mAh/g.",ACS Nano
Enhancing the rapid Na+-storage performance via electron/ion bridges through GeS2/graphene heterojunction,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Hybridizing carbonous matrix into metal sulfide is confirmed as an effective strategy to enhance electrode conductance and structure stability. However, a comprehensive understanding of the interface reaction mechanism between active materials and carbon substrate is still urgently needed. Based on the band energy theory, a route to enhance the rate ability for electrode is exploited on regulating interfaces of substrates/active heterojunction. Herein, the highly stable Na+-storage performance of GeS2/3DG is delicately designed, where the hierarchical structure is enabled by uniformly overcoating GeS2 nanograins with graphene matrix. Different from the widespread doping route of active materials for fast ion transfer, we focus on the effects of interface regulation on the high-rate Na- ion-storage performance of substrate/active materials. Here, a well-designed interface of the C-Ge bond at the heterointerface induced by hierarchical GeS2/graphene heterojunction is pioneeringly explored, which can result in a fast electron transfer by reducing electron gathering polarization. More importantly, defects in graphene can alleviate the polarization aroused by ion concentration, which not only offers anchoring/ doping sites for C-Ge bond but also provides extra ion channels for Na-ion transportation into GeS2. This interface regulation of constructing metal-carbon bonds will shine light on the reaction kinetics and interface stability and contribute to the fundamental understanding of interface reaction mechanisms for metal sulfide anode materials.",ACS Nano

The application of its hybrid nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage devices is also discussed. © 2020 The Author(s)Graphene and its hybrids have been considered promising candidates for electrochemical energy storage because of their fascinating physicochemical properties. However, they suffer from unsatisfactory areal or volumetric energy density and relatively poor rate performance. These drawbacks are due to limited accessible surface area and poor ion diffusion capacity arising from the agglomeration and restacking of graphene nanosheets during electrode assembly. To solve the above issues, perforation on the graphene planes is adopted, which bestows the graphene-based nanomaterials with porous architectures. In particular, in-plane holes are capable of accelerating ion transport across the graphene sheets and ultimately accessing the inner electrode surface. Here, a comprehensive review of holey graphene-based nanomaterials is presented, which summarizes recent progress from their rational design and controlled synthesis to their applications in electrochemical energy storage. Finally, perspectives on the future directions of their large-scale synthesis and advanced assembly protocols as electrodes are proposed and discussed.",Cell Reports Physical Science
A boron-exposed TiB3monolayer with a lower electrostatic-potential surface as a higher-performance anode material for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries,"© the Owner Societies.The lack of high-performance anode materials has become a major obstacle to the development of Li- and Na-ion batteries. Recently, 2D transition metal borides (e.g. MBenes) have attracted much attention due to their excellent stability and electrical conductivity. Unfortunately, most of the reported MBene phases typically have an intrinsic metal-rich structure with metal atoms exposed on the surface, which harmfully affect the adsorption of Li/Na atoms. Here, through crystal structure prediction combined with the first-principles density functional theory, a novel TiB3 MBene has been determined by altering the proportion of non-metallic element boron to wrap metal atoms and weaken nearest-neighbor electrostatic repulsion. Electrostatic potential analysis visually shows a surface with low potential on the TiB3 monolayer implying high adsorption capacity, and also can be used to quickly screen out the Li/Na adsorption sites. Accurate half-cell battery simulation confirmably shows that the TiB3 monolayer possesses a theoretical specific capacity of 1335.04 and 667.52 mA h g-1 for Li and Na, respectively. The TiB3 monolayer can remain metallic after adsorbing Li/Na atoms, which ensures good conductivity during battery cycling. The ultra-low barrier energy (only 38 meV for Li) and suitable open-circuit voltage indicate excellent charging and discharging capabilities. These results suggest that the TiB3 monolayer could be a promising anode material for Li- and Na-ion batteries, and provide a simple design principle for exposing non-metallic atoms on the surface.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Computational refinement of the puzzling red tetrasulfur chromophore in ultramarine pigments,"© the Owner Societies.We investigated the cryptic red chromophore, accompanying the blue S3- radical in ultramarine pigments, which usually was tentatively assigned to an unspecified isomer of either neutral S4 or ionic S4- species. To reveal its identity, we performed the first systematic density functional studies on periodic and large cluster models of red ultramarines, considering several S4/S4- isomers embedded in aluminosilicate cages. For both neutral and charged tetrasulfides the most stable confined isomer is the planar C2v one. The only plausible candidate for the red chromophore among the tetrasulfur species is the planar C2v isomer of the neutral S4 molecule, which, apart from being thermodynamically preferable, strongly absorbs green light and its vibrational modes match very well with the available Raman data. The C2v-S4- radical, if present at all in red ultramarines, could be identified by strong absorption in the near infrared region and possibly by the slightly larger isotropic value of the g tensor than that of the S3- radical.

Sulfone-assisted-NH4I as electrolyte additive with synergistic dissolution and catalysis effects on reducing the activation voltage of Li2S cathode,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Li2S is highly desired for high energy-density lithium sulfur batteries since it allows to be matched with Li metal-free anodes and alleviates the volume expansion of S cathode. However, Li+ extraction from Li2S usually suffers from a huge voltage barrier due to its poor electron conductivity and sluggish Li+ ion diffusion during activation. In this work, trace sulfone-assisted-NH4I is adopted as an electrolyte additive with synergistic dissolution and catalysis effects to alleviate the voltage barrier of Li2S. On one hand, the intercalation between sulfone-NH4+ and Li2S turns solid Li2S into liquid phase, which significantly speeding up the transport of electrons and Li+ ions during activation. On the other hand, I− works as a redox mediator, which further facilitates the oxidation of Li2S to polysulfides.

Rod-shaped monoclinic CoMo2S4 with exceptionally reversible phase conversion for sodium storage,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Binary metal sulfides have gained wide attention for sodium storage materials benefiting from rich redox sites, high electrochemical activity and high electronic conductivity. However, poor cycle performance and structure reversibility still restrict their applications. Therefore, rational element combination with the exclusive preparation methods are of great significance. Herein, a rod-shaped CoMo2S4 (CMS) with a monoclinic phase was successfully synthesized and investigated as a new anode material for sodium-ion batteries. CMS exhibits promising cycle performance and rate capability (418.1 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 228.9 mAh g−1 at 8 A g−1). The investigation of detailed sodium storage mechanism for CMS reveals exceptionally reversible phase conversion between CMS and metallic Co/Mo phases without generating monometal sulfides (CoSx or MoSx) during discharge and charge processes. The synergistic catalytic effect of ultrafine Mo and Co nanoparticles on the decomposition of Na2S plays a vital role in the reversible phase transition of CMS, which provides new insights for the design of binary metal sulfide anodes for sodium-ion batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Tunable MXene-Derived 1D/2D Hybrid Nanoarchitectures as a Stable Matrix for Dendrite-Free and Ultrahigh Capacity Sodium Metal Anode,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Although sodium (Na) is one of the most promising alternatives to lithium as an anode material for next-generation batteries, uncontrollable Na dendrite growth still remains the main challenge for Na metal batteries. Herein, a novel 1D/2D Na3Ti5O12-MXene hybrid nanoarchitecture consisting of Na3Ti5O12 nanowires grown between the MXene nanosheets is synthesized by a facile approach using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-pretreated Ti3C2 MXene. Used as a matrix for the Na metal anode, the Na3Ti5O12 nanowires, formed benefiting from the CTAB stabilization, have chemical interaction with Na and thus provide abundant Na nucleation sites. These 1D nanostructures, together with the unique confinement effect from the 2D nanosheets, effectively guide and control the Na deposition within the interconnected nanochannels, preventing the ""hot spot""formation for dendrite growth. A stable cycling performance can be achieved at a high current density up to 10 mA cm-2 along with an ultrahigh capacity up to 20 mAh cm-2.",Nano Letters
3D printed rGO/CNT microlattice aerogel for a dendrite-free sodium metal anode,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.Uncontrolled dendrite formation induces inferior electrochemical performance in sodium metal and even severe safety issues, resulting in metallic sodium anode being unsuitable for practical applications. Herein, an artificial reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (rGO/CNT) microlattice aerogel was constructed using three-dimensional (3D) printing technology and further adopted as a sodium metal host. With its specially designed architecture, the 3D rGO/CNT microlattice aerogel can effectively reduce the local current density and provide abundant active nucleation sites, resulting in homogeneous sodium deposition to overcome the issue of dendrite formation. As a result, the Na@rGO/CNT microlattice anode enables an areal capacity of 1 mA h cm−2at 2 mA cm−2with a small nucleation overpotential of 17.8 mV, with a stable cycling performance for 640 cycles at a high current density of 8 mA cm−2. The experimental and simulation results show that the improved performance can be attributed to the rational design of the hierarchical rGO/CNT microlattice aerogel with tuned surface kinetics. Finally, a full battery using a 3D Na@rGO/CNT microlattice as an anode was assembled and delivered a capacity of 67.6 mA h g−1at 100 mA g−1after 100 cycles. Our results demonstrate that the 3D printed rGO/CNT microlattice aerogel is a promising candidate as a sodium metal host for future generation of sodium metal batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Structure Evolution of Na2O2from Room Temperature to 500 °c,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Na2O2 is one of the possible discharge products from sodium-air batteries. Here, we report the evolution of the structure of Na2O2 from room temperature to 500 °C using variable-temperature neutron and synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. A phase transition from α-Na2O2 to β-Na2O2 is observed in the neutron diffraction measurements above 400 °C, and the crystal structure of β-Na2O2 is determined from neutron diffraction data at 500 °C. α-Na2O2 adapts a hexagonal P62m (no. 189) structure, and β-Na2O2 adapts a tetragonal I41/acd (no. 142) structure. The thermal expansion coefficients of α-Na2O2 are a = 2.98(1) × 10-5 K-1, c = 2.89(1) × 10-5 K-1, and V = 8.96(1) × 10-5 K-1 up to 400 °C, and a ∼10% volume expansion occurs during the phase transition from α-Na2O2 to β-Na2O2 due to the realignment/rotation of O22- groups. Both phases are electronic insulators according to DFT calculations with band gaps (both indirect) of 1.75 eV (α-Na2O2) and 2.56 eV (β-Na2O2). An impedance analysis from room temperature to 400 °C revealed a significant enhancement of the conductivity at T ≥ 275 °C. α-Na2O2 shows a higher conductivity (∼10 times at T ≤ 275 °C and ∼3 times at T > 275 °C) in O2 compared to in Ar. We confirmed, by dielectric analysis, that this enhanced conductivity is dominated by ionic conduction.",Inorganic Chemistry

First, Bi(BTC) (DMF)·DMF·(CH3OH)2 (Bi-BTC) was prepared by a solvothermal process and then converted into Bi2Te3@C composite by a simple tellurization reaction. As anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the Bi2Te3@C electrode shows outstanding cycling stability with a specific discharge capacity of 738.5 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 500 cycles. Meanwhile, the Bi2Te3@C composite also demonstrates a specific discharge capacity of 236.4 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles in sodium ion batteries (SIBs). The significant electrochemical performance in LIBs and SIBs is attributed to the nano size of Bi2Te3, which can not only reduce the migration path of electron and ions, but also tolerate the volume variations in the cycle life. Besides, the carbon derived from Bi-BTC can enhance the electrical conductivity of Bi2Te3 nanoparticles and prevent their agglomeration. Electrochemical kinetic analysis of Bi2Te3@C indicates the capacitive contribution accounts for a substantial part for the capacity, which can enhance the rate performance of Bi2Te3@C electrode. This work demonstrates that Bi2Te3@C has a promising application in practical lithium and sodium storage.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Hard carbons for sodium-ion batteries and beyond,"© 2020 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing LtdSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are one of the most promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), due to the much more abundant resources of Na compared with Li in the world. Developing SIB technology to satisfy the increased demand for energy storage is therefore a significant task. However, one of the biggest bottlenecks is the design of high-performance and low-cost anode materials, since the graphite anode in commercial LIBs is not suitable for SIBs due to thermal dynamic issues. Hard carbon materials have been regarded as having the greatest potential as anodes in commercial SIBs owing to their excellent cost-effectiveness, but their relatively limited performance compared to the graphite in LIBs as well as the dimness of the sodium storage mechanisms still need further investigation. In this review, we summarize the progress of recent research into hard carbons for SIB applications, including the fundamentals of SIBs, sodium storage mechanisms, structures and the electrochemical performances of different types of hard carbons in SIBs and other types of sodium-based energy storage as well as the main challenges in this field. We aim to provide a general insight into hard carbons and their applications in SIBs, opening up future perspectives and possible research directions.",Progress in Energy
An aqueous hybrid electrolyte for low-temperature zinc-based energy storage devices,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Aqueous zinc-based energy storage (ZES) devices are promising candidates for portable and grid-scale applications owing to their intrinsically high safety, low cost, and high theoretical energy density. However, the conventional aqueous electrolytes are not capable of working at low temperature. Here we report a frigostable, cost-effective, safe and eco-friendly hybrid electrolyte with high zinc-ion conductivity (6.9 mS cm-1 at -40 °C), and high reversibility of Zn plating/stripping, which consists of water, ethylene glycol (EG) and zinc sulfate salt (ZnSO4). Experiments together with theoretical calculations demonstrated that the unique solvation interaction of Zn2+ with EG can effectively enhance the hydrogen bonding between EG and H2O and weaken the solvation interaction of Zn2+ with H2O, thus providing the hybrid electrolyte with a lower freezing point and reversible Zn/Zn2+ chemistry. As a proof-of-concept, both Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) and Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) with the hybrid electrolytes delivered high energy densities (36 W h kg-1 for the ZHSC and 121 W h kg-1 for the ZIB), high power densities (3.1 kW kg-1 for the ZHSC and 1.7 kW kg-1 for the ZIB) and long-cycle life (5500 cycles over 110 days for the ZHSC and 250 cycles for the ZIB) at -20 °C.

Published by IOP Publishing LtdIn order to improve the performance of the beta-Al2O3 solid electrolyte, the influence of Cr doping during the preparation of Na-beta-Al2O3 by solid state method was studied, the α-Al2O3 and Na2C2O4 was used as raw materials, and Li+ was added to stabilize β″ phase. The results showed that without Cr2O3 doping, the β″ phase content of the electrolyte was 92.28%, and the relative density was 99.07% of the theoretical density. The appropriate amount of Cr element could stabilize the β″ phase and refine the grain, when the doping amount of Cr2O3 was 0.15 wt%, the content of β″ phase could reach 97.93%, the relative density was 99.07%, the ionic conductivity was 0.082 S · cm−1 at 350 °C, and the bending strength was 253 Mpa. In addition, the excessive Cr element tends to gather in the grain boundary, resulting in the melting state and non-uniform size of the grains, and it will also hinder the formation of the β″ phase.",Materials Research Express
Microporous carbon nanoparticles for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are emerging as some of the most promising next-generation battery alternatives to state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high gravimetric energy density, being inexpensive, and having an abundance of elemental sulfur (S8). However, one main, well-known drawback of LSBs is the so-called polysulfide shuttling, where the polysulfide dissolves into organic electrolytes from sulfur host materials. Numerous studies have shown the ability of porous carbon as a sulfur host material. Porous carbon can significantly impede polysulfide shuttling and mitigate the insulating passivation layers, such as Li2S, owing to its intrinsic high electrical conductivity. This work suggests a scalable and straightforward one-step synthesis method to prepare a unique interconnected microporous and mesoporous carbon framework via salt templating with a eutectic mixture of Lil and KI at 800 °C in an inert atmosphere. The synthesis step used environmentally friendly water as a washing solvent to remove salt from the carbon-salt mixture. When employed as a sulfur host material, the electrode exhibited an excellent capacity of 780 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1 and a sulfur loading mass of 2 mg cm-2 with a minor capacity loss of 0.36% per cycle for 100 cycles. This synthesis method of a unique porous carbon structure could provide a new avenue for the development of an electrode with a high retention capacity and high accommodated sulfur for electrochemical energy storage applications.",Nanomaterials

"Integrating Conductivity, Captivity, and Immobility Ability into N/O Dual-Doped Porous Carbon Nanocage Anchored with CNT as an Effective Se Host for Advanced K-Se Battery","© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHPotassium–selenium (K-Se) batteries have attracted increasing attention for their potential as stationary energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. The major challenges of these batteries are the low utilization of active selenium, sluggish kinetics, and the volume change during cycling. Herein, a N and O dual-doped porous carbon nanocage anchored with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (denoted as NO-nanocage/CNT) is designed as a host for Se. This material combines multiple advantages, such as abundant N/O active sites and excellent electrical conductivity, to realize highly efficient immobilization of Se and polyselenide and fast redox kinetics. The hollow carbon skeleton, with abundant micro and mesoporous structures, shortens the diffusion distances between the ions/electrons and accommodates the volume expansion of the active materials. Density functional theory calculations further confirm that the NO-nanocage/CNT exhibits strong chemical affinity to K2Se, which is in agreement with the experimental results. The Se@NO-nanocage/CNT cathode displays a remarkable reversible capacity (623 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1) and an ultra-long cycle life (274 mAh g−1 after 3500 cycles at 1.0 A g−1).

Sodiophilically Graded Gold Coating on Carbon Skeletons for Highly Stable Sodium Metal Anodes,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHMetallic sodium (Na) is an appealing anode material for high-energy Na batteries. However, Na metal suffers from low coulombic efficiencies and severe dendrite growth during plating/stripping cycles, causing short circuits. As an effective strategy to improve the deposition behavior of Na metal, a 3D carbon foam is developed that is sputter-coated with gold nanoparticles (Au/CF), forming a functional gradient through its thickness. The highly porous Au/CF host is proven to have gradually varying sodiophilicity, which in turn facilitates initially preferential Na deposition on the gold-rich, sodiophilic region in a “bottom-up growth” mode, leading to uniform plating over the entire Au/CF host. This finding contrasts with dendrite formation in the pristine CF host, as proven by in situ microscopy. The Na-predeposited Au/CF (Na@Au/CF) composite anode operates steadily for 1000 h at a low overpotential of ≈20 mV at 2 mA cm−2 in a symmetric cell. When the composite anode is coupled with a Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode, the full cell has a high capacity of 102.1 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 2 C. The sodiophilicity gradient design that is explored in this study offers new insight into developing porous Na metal hosts with highly stable plating/stripping performance for next-generation Na batteries.",Small

Toward Rapid-Charging Sodium-Ion Batteries using Hybrid-Phase Molybdenum Sulfide Selenide-Based Anodes,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHTo attain both high energy density and power density in sodium-ion (Na+) batteries, the reaction kinetics and structural stability of anodes should be improved by materials optimization. In this work, few-layered molybdenum sulfide selenide (MoSSe) consisting of a mixture of 1T and 2H phases is designed to provide high ionic/electrical conductivities, low Na+ diffusion barrier, and stable Na+ storage. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is used as a conductive matrix to form 3D electron transfer paths. The resulting MoSSe@rGO anode exhibits high capacity and rate performance in both organic and solid-state electrolytes. The ultrafast Na+ storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO anode is attributed to the surface-dominant reaction process and broad Na+ channels. In situ and ex situ measurements are conducted to reveal the Na+ storage process in MoSSe@rGO. It is found that the Mo-S and Mo-Se bonds effectively limit the dissolution of the active materials. The favorable Na+ storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO electrode are ascribed to its low adsorption energy of −1.997 eV and low diffusion barrier of 0.087 eV. These results reveal that anion doping of metal sulfides is a feasible strategy to develop sodium-ion batteries with high energy and power densities and long life-span.",Advanced Materials

Spurred on by the failures in commercializing Li-S and Na-S batteries, K-Q (Q = S, Se, and SexSy) batteries have entered the sights of researchers because of the low redox potential and natural abundance of element K and its synergistic reaction with S or Se. Unfortunately, the current K-Q battery still suffers from several drawbacks, such as drastic volume change, shuttling phenomenon, relatively low reactivity, and dendrite growth. To help to push forward progress of the K-Q battery, here in this review, we first introduce the operation principle and the fundamental challenges faced by the current K-Q batteries, followed by a comprehensive review of effective strategies that have been developed, including engineering of the electrode structure and optimization of the battery composition. Discussions of the mechanism are also included to deepen the understanding of such battery systems. Finally, we discuss the perspectives and challenges for practical application of K-Q batteries. We hope the insights provided in this review can shed light on this new yet rapidly developing field and offer guidance for the development of future high-performance K-Q batteries.",Materials Today
Facile synthesis of sulfurized polyacrylonitrile composite as cathode for high-rate lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) as a promising cathode material for lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries has drawn increasing attention for its improved electrochemical performance in carbonate-based electrolyte. However, the relatively poor electronic and ionic conductivities of SPAN limit its high-rate and low-temperature performances. In this work, a novel one-dimensional nanofiber SPAN (SFPAN) composite is developed as the cathode material for Li-S batteries. Benefitting from its one-dimensional nanostructure, the SFPAN composite cathode provides fast channels for the migration of ions and electronics, thus effectively improving its electrochemical performance at high rates and low temperature. As a result, the SFPAN maintains a high reversible specific capacity ~ 1200 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles at 0.3 A g−1 and can deliver a high capacity of ~ 850 mAh g−1 even at a high current density of 12.5 A g−1. What is more, the SFPAN can achieve a capacity of ~ 800 mAh g−1 at 0 °C and ~ 1550 mAh g−1 at 60 °C, thus providing a wider temperature range of applications. This work provides new perspectives on the cathode design for high-rate lithium-sulfur batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Cubic MnS-FeS2Composites Derived from a Prussian Blue Analogue as Anode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries with Long-Term Cycle Stability,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Cubic N,S codoped carbon coating MnS-FeS2 composites (MnS-FeS2@NSC) with a hollow structure were prepared and used as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. MnS-FeS2@NSC exhibits excellent cycle performance and high rate capability and delivered a reversible capacity of 501.0 mAh g-1 after 800 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 with a capacity retention of 81%. More importantly, the MnS-FeS2@NSC anode holds long-term cycle stability; the capacity can remain 134.0 mAh g-1 after 14 »500 cycles at 4 A g-1. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that Na+ storage follows a pseudocapacitive dominating process, which is ascribed to the origin of the outstanding rate performance of the MnS-FeS2@NSC material. The enhancement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the hollow structure and the N,S codoped carbon coating structure, which can reduce the diffusion distance for sodium ions and electrons, alleviate volume expansion during sodium-ion insertion/extraction, and retain the structural integrity effectively. Furthermore, a two-step sodiation processes with FeS2 sodiation prior to MnS was demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra might indicate that the accumulation of the metallic elements in the preconversion reaction can accelerate the transfer of electrons and ions in the further conversion process.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Novel Approach through the Harmonized Sulfur in Disordered Carbon Structure for High-Efficiency Sodium-Ion Exchange,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Sodium-ion batteries (SiBs) have recently attracted considerable interest due to the plentiful supply of raw materials for their production and their electrochemical behavior, which is similar to that of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). However, the relatively larger radius of sodium ions than that of lithium ions is not suitable for storage in conventional graphite, which is widely used as the anode. To resolve this issue, in this study, we developed a new harmonized carbon material with a three-dimensional (3D) grapevine-like structure and a sulfur component using an efficient synthesis process. On the basis of these advantages, the harmonized sulfur-carbon material exhibited a highly reversible capacity of 146 mA h g-1 at an extremely high specific current of 100 A g-1 and long-term galvanostatic cycling stability at 10 and 100 A g-1 with superior electrochemical performance. Our results are anticipated to provide new insights into SiB anode materials that would advance their production.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

The preparation of NiO/Ni-N/C nanocomposites and its electrocatalytic performance for methanol oxidation reaction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2020.Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been extensively studied for developing a new non-precious metal catalyst to replace commercial platinum catalysts, due to their expensive cost and susceptibility to CO poisoning. In this work, nanocomposites of nickel oxide/nickel supported by N-doped carbon (NiO/Ni-N/C) were prepared by using a hydrothermal method and further carbonization at different temperatures. The surface morphology and composition of the NiO/Ni-N/C nanocomposites were characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As observed through electrochemical experiments, the NiO/Ni-N/C nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode (NiO/Ni-N/C/GCE) exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline solution. Among the nanocomposites, NiO/Ni-N/C carbonized at 500 °C (NiO/Ni-N/C500) displays the highest mass activity (1043 mA mgNi−1) at 0.73 V (vs.Ag/AgCl), which is much higher than that of Ni(OH)2/N-C and NiO/Ni-N/C carbonized at other temperatures (400, 600, and 700 °C). In addition, the catalytic activity of NiO/Ni-N/C500is 2.12 times that of the commercial Pt/C. NiO/Ni-N/C500/GCE also possesses fast kinetics, excellent stability and CO tolerance.

3D Ni/Na metal anode for improved sodium metal batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Sodium metal batteries are regarded as a promising energy storage system due to the natural abundance of sodium metal. However, sodium metal batteries severely suffer from the formation of Na dendrites and a large volume change during the repetitive Na stripping/plating process. In this work, a 3D Ni/Na metal anode is fabricated by incorporating Na into 3D Ni foam using a facile mechanical rolling strategy. The resultant 3D Ni/Na metal anode shows a lower overpotential and a higher cycling stability in comparison with bare Na metal anode in symmetric cells. Furthermore, in full cells with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, the 3D Ni/Na metal anode exhibits highly reversible capacity of 75 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 1 C and superior rate capability in contrast with bare Na metal anode.",Materials Letters
High performance room temperature Na-S batteries based on FCNT modified Co3C-Co nanocubes,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.High-temperature Sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries have been commercial owing to their high energy density. However, their extra safety and cost issues caused by high-temperature inhibits their wide application. Recently, room-temperature Na-S batteries have attracted widespread attention due to the low cost and excellent energy density. Nevertheless, they still suffer from the poor conductivity, sluggish redox kinetics and shuttle effect. Herein, the incorporated polar Co3C-Co with open fluorinated carbon nanotubes arrays encapsulated in porous three-dimensional (3D) framework (FCNT@Co3C-Co) was designed and applied as the sulfur host for Na-S battery. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that the polar and porous FCNT@Co3C-Co possesses the strong interactions with Na+ and S intermediate species (NaPSs), which increases the sulfide utilization and suppresses the shuttle effect by the efficient physisorption/chemisorption and rapid electrocatalytic conversion. Moreover, the synergy of the porous cube-like framework and superior interface property in FCNT@Co3C-Co mitigates the huge volume variations and reduces the energy barrier for Na-S battery. Hence, the FCNT@Co3C-Co based Na-S batteries deliver a high discharge capacity of 1364 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C even with a lean E/S of 5 mL g−1 under a high S loading of 3.2 mg cm−2 and show Coulombic efficiency above 75% after 500 loops under 2 C at room-temperature.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Polyolefin-Based Janus Separator for Rechargeable Sodium Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRechargeable sodium batteries are a promising technology for low-cost energy storage. However, the undesirable drawbacks originating from the use of glass fiber membrane separators have long been overlooked. A versatile grafting–filtering strategy was developed to controllably tune commercial polyolefin separators for sodium batteries. The as-developed Janus separators contain a single–ion-conducting polymer-grafted side and a functional low-dimensional material coated side. When employed in room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries, the poly(1-[3-(methacryloyloxy)propylsulfonyl]-1-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide sodium)-grafted side effectively enhances the electrolyte wettability, and inhibits polysulfide diffusion and sodium dendrite growth. Moreover, a titanium-deficient nitrogen-containing MXene-coated side electrocatalytically improved the polysulfide conversion kinetics. The as-developed batteries demonstrate high capacity and extended cycling life with lean electrolyte loading.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
On the challenge of large energy storage by electrochemical devices,"© 2020This paper reviews work that promotes the effective use of renewable energy sources (solar and wind) by developing technologies for large energy storage, concentrating on electrochemical devices. Unfortunately, we are not far from a non-return situation related to global warming due to green-house gasses emission, 88% of which is contributed through release of CO2 by combusting fossil fuels. Major contributors to CO2 emission are power stations that produce electricity. Only a massive replacement of fossil fuels combustion by photovoltaic solar panels and wind turbines for electricity production can reduce drastically the detrimental CO2 emission. The success of using renewable energy depends on the availability of technologies for large energy storage. We believe that modern electrochemistry can provide them. We review herein relevant options. While hydrogen based technology using fuel cells and flow batteries are valid options, we believe that stationary rechargeable batteries are most important for large energy storage and load leveling applications. We review herein a plethora of systems: Li and Na ion batteries, systems based on multivalent metal anodes (Mg, Ca, Zn, Al), aqueous batteries and hybrid systems comprising capacitive and redox electrodes. For the latter systems we discuss in detail relevant options for capacitive electrodes. Highly important is the use of systems composed of abundant elements. Improved lead-acid batteries are interesting thanks to the possibility to recycle lead effectively. Li ion batteries comprising Li4Ti5O12 anodes and LiFePO4 or LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4 cathodes are also very suitable for load leveling applications, depending on the availability of lithium, which is discussed herein as well.",Electrochimica Acta
Elastic NaxMoS2-Carbon-BASE Triple Interface Direct Robust Solid-Solid Interface for All-Solid-State Na-S Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.The developments of all-solid-state sodium batteries are severely constrained by poor Na-ion transport across incompatible solid-solid interfaces. We demonstrate here a triple NaxMoS2-carbon-BASE nanojunction interface strategy to address this challenge using the β″-Al2O3 solid electrolyte (BASE). Such an interface was constructed by adhering ternary Na electrodes containing 3 wt % MoS2 and 3 wt % carbon on BASE and reducing contact angles of molten Na to ∼45°. The ternary Na electrodes exhibited twice improved elasticity for flexible deformation and intimate solid contact, whereas NaxMoS2 and carbon synergistically provide durable ionic/electronic diffusion paths, which effectively resist premature interface failure due to loss of contact and improved Na stripping utilization to over 90%. Na metal hosted via triple junctions exhibited much smaller charge-transfer resistance and 200 h of stable cycling. The novel interface architecture enabled 1100 mAh/g cycling of all-solid-state Na-S batteries when using advanced sulfur cathodes with Na-ion conductive PEO10-NaFSI binder and NaxMo6S8 redox catalytic mediator.",Nano Letters
Printable Ink Design towards Customizable Miniaturized Energy Storage Devices,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Miniaturized electrochemical energy storage devices (MEESDs) are widely utilized in microelectronic devices because of their lightweight, controllable size and shape, excellent electrochemical performance and flexibility, and high durability.

Initial investigation and evaluation of potassium metal as an anode for rechargeable potassium batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Potassium, the third alkali element after sodium on the periodic table, provides several advantages over lithium and sodium as a charge carrier in rechargeable batteries. Pertaining to its natural features, potassium has a lower standard redox potential than other metallic elements (-2.93 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) and is highly abundant in the Earth's crust. For these reasons, to date, the development of rechargeable potassium batteries has attracted considerable attention in the search for high-energy and cost-effective energy storage systems. In the development of rechargeable potassium batteries, K metal anodes are the key material and act as the counter electrode to evaluate electrochemical electrode materials in the half-cell configuration. Moreover, they are also an essential component of full-cell potassium-sulfur and potassium-oxygen systems. However, the main hurdle in the widespread acceptance of K metal as an anode in rechargeable potassium batteries lies in identifying fundamental problems and developing suitable solutions. Here, we initially investigate and evaluate potassium metal as an anode for rechargeable potassium batteries and detail the major challenges for K metal systems, that at this time, limit the feasibility of rechargeable potassium batteries, particularly, dendritic growth for liquid systems, poor coulombic efficiency, and the unstable interface between the K metal and electrolyte. In addition, we also highlight the key developments and recent achievements in the stabilization of K metal anodes and their application.

Selenium or Tellurium as Eutectic Accelerators for High-Performance Lithium/Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University.Abstract: Lithium (Li)/sodium (Na)–sulfur (S) batteries are considered to be competitive candidates for the next-generation energy storage devices due to ultrahigh theoretical energy densities and potential low costs. However, the insulating nature of S and dissolution of intermediate polysulfides hinder the development. Here, the use of selenium (Se) or tellurium (Te) as eutectic accelerators in S cathodes can significantly improve the performances. Se and Te can not only be easily introduced into S to form uniform dispersions at the molecular level through S–Se or S–Te bonds and contribute to capacity through their inherent redox reactions, but also significantly accelerate reaction kinetics and alleviate polysulfide dissolution to achieve excellent battery performances. Even for solid-state conversion mechanisms or in all-solid-state batteries, Se or Te can enhance the electronic and ionic conductivities to result in better rate and cycling performances. Overall, Se or Te modified S cathodes possess good compatibility with both Li and Na anode materials and can exhibit excellent electrochemical performances. Therefore, the use of Se or Te as eutectic accelerators in S cathodes is a universal and effective strategy to enhance battery performances and obtain better Li/Na–S batteries.

Interface Concentrated-Confinement Suppressing Cathode Dissolution in Water-in-Salt Electrolyte,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHMass dissolution is one main problems for cathodes in aqueous electrolytes due to the strong polarity of water molecules. In principle, mass dissolution is a thermodynamically favorable process as determined by the Gibbs free energy. However, in real situations, dissolution kinetics, which include viscosity, dissolving mass mobility, and interface properties, are also a critical factor influencing the dissolution rate. Both thermodynamic and kinetic dissolving factors can be regulated by the ratio of salt to solvent in the electrolyte. In this study, concentration-controlled cathode dissolution is investigated in a susceptible Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode whose time-, cycle-, and state-of-charge-dependent dissolubility are evaluated by multiple electrochemical and chemical methods. It is verified that the super-highly concentrated water-in-salt electrolyte has a high viscosity, low vanadium ion diffusion, low polarity of solvated water, and scarce solute−water dissolving surfaces. These factors significantly lower the thermodynamic-controlled solubility and the dissolving kinetics via time and physical space local mass interfacial confinement, thereby inducing a new mechanism of interface concentrated-confinement which improves the cycling stability in real aqueous rechargeable sodium-ion batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials

GF are extensively used as electrodes but they do not have the desired electrochemical properties. MnO2@CeO2 composites have novel electrocatalyst features. Hence, MnO2@CeO2 composites were developed and applied to GF. Chemical and structural features of the bare graphite felt electrode and MnO2@CeO2 composite-modified graphite felt electrode (MGF) were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area analysis. Similarly, the electrochemical performance was investigated using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Tafel, and charge–discharge performance experiments. The charge−discharge experiments were performed at 1 to 3 mg cm− 2 weight of MGFs and varying the current densities from 40 to 70 mA cm− 2. The coulombic efficiency (ηC) and peak power density (PPD) of the cell (132 cm2) determined at 50 mA cm− 2 for 2 mg cm− 2-MGF electrode was found to be 99.10% and 55.56 W cm− 2, respectively. Among the three different types of electrodes, the MGF electrode showed better electrocatalytic performance mainly due to the excellent conducting network of the oxygen moieties of MnO2@CeO2 composites.

The superior performance for overall water splitting is probably attributed to the synergistic effect of Co1−xS and ALD CoN. Specifically, implementation of ALD can be extended to innovate nanostructured materials for overall water splitting and even other renewable energy aspects.",Small

During Na insertion, the CoSbS undergoes a topotactic transformation owing to the formation of a NaxCoSbS (x ≤ 1.6), and then, it is converted into Na3Sb, Na2S, and Co in the fully Na-inserted state via a conversion reaction. Conversely, during Na extraction, Na3Sb transforms to Sb, which alloys with Co to form CoSb. In the fully Na-extracted state, CoSb and S from Na2S are recombined into CoSbS. Owing to the interesting reaction mechanism of CoSbS, the electrochemical performance of the CoSbS and CoSbS@hard-C anodes is excellent. Specifically, when CoSbS is used as a NIB anode, the topotactic transformation between CoSbS and NaxCoSbS (x ≤ 1.6) leads to stable cycling behavior of the NIB and a volumetric capacity of ~480 mAh cm−3 is retained after 100 cycles. Additionally, the NIB with the CoSbS@hard-C anode presents highly reversible and stable capacity (~570 mAh cm−3 after 150 cycles) and fast rate capability (~500 and ~450 mAh cm−3 at 2C and 5C, respectively), which can be attributed to the presence of uniformly dispersed small (5–8 nm) CoSbS nanocrystallites in the hard carbon matrix. Therefore, CoSbS can be utilized as a new anode material for high-performance NIBs.",Materials Today Energy
Molybdenum carbide nanocrystals modified carbon nanofibers as electrocatalyst for enhancing polysulfides redox reactions in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 John Wiley & Sons LtdThe high performance of lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries is the focus of research in recent years. However, the low sulfur loading, shuttling effect in electrolyte, and poor cycling stability limit their applications. Herein, molybdenum carbide nanocrystals embedded carbon nanofibers (Mo2C@CFs: MCCFs) hybrid membrane was prepared in situ on CFs membrane based on carbonthermal reduction of ammonium molybdate. The fibrous MCCFs network is used as the current collector with Li2S6 catholyte solution for Li-S batteries, which inhibits the shuttle effect and accelerates kinetics redox reaction. In addition, Mo2C, as electrocatalyst, promotes nucleation of Li2S of the MCCFs substance, which can reduce polarization and increase the specific capacity. As a result, the free-standing MCCFs@Li2S6 electrode (sulfur loading: 4.74 mg) shows a capacity of 977 mAh g−1 and maintains at 828 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C over 250 cycles, and indicates excellent reversibility and cycling stability. Even with sulfur loading as high as 7.11 mg, the MCCF@Li2S6 electrode exhibits an extremely high capacity of 5.75 mAh. Meanwhile, the Mo2C modified CFs can be effectively retarding the self-discharge behavior by trapping the polysulfides. Furthermore, the stability improvement of lithium anode state by effectively suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfide, played an important role in enhancing the electrochemical performance.",International Journal of Energy Research

"Two-dimensional 1T-PS2 as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries with ultra-high capacity, low average voltage and appropriate mobility","© 2020 The AuthorAs electrodes, two-dimensional materials show special advantages including the infinite planar lengths, broad electrochemical window, large surface–volume ratio, and much exposed active sites. In theory, the two-dimensional materials consist of the elements with high electronegativity may absorb more Na atoms, resulting in a high battery storage capacity. Based on the above idea, we selected the two dimensional metallic PS2 with 1T-Type structure as an anode material, and explored its potential applications as an electrode material for Na-ion battery through first-principle calculations. As we expected, when two dimensional PS2 is used as an anode in Na-ion battery, it can adsorb maximum three layers of sodium atoms on both sides of the monolayer, resulting in a maximum theoretical capacity of 1692 mAh/g. Furthermore, it also possesses a rather small sodium diffusion barrier of 0.17 eV, a low average open-circuit voltage of 0.18 V, and a relatively small lattice changes within 13% during the intercalation of Na. These results suggested that the two dimensional PS2 is a potentially excellent Na-ion battery anode. Our idea of designing two-dimensional anode materials with high storage capacity may provide some references for designing the next generation anode materials of metal-ion batteries.",Chinese Chemical Letters
Self-assembly formation of hierarchical mixed spinel MnCo2O4 porous nanospheres confined by polypyrrole pyrolytic carbon for high-performance lithium storage,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdThe spinel MnCo2O4 characterizing metallic synergistic effect and multi-electron transfer is a promising anode material in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) fields. In the work, the MnCo2O4 porous nanospheres are prepared in virtue of self-assembly ability of glycerol micro-emulsion and subsequent annealing under appropriate temperature. Polypyrrole pyrolytic carbon is introduced to hybridize with low-dimension MnCo2O4 material to settle the common problems of intrinsic low electrical conductivity and severe volume expansion of electrode material. Because of hierarchical porous structure, polypyrrole pyrolytic carbon and metallic synergistic effect, the electrode delivers higher specific capacity, better rate capability and long-term cycling stability compared to several spinel-type oxides/carbon composites.",Materials Today Energy
A controllable flower-like FeMoO4/FeS2/Mo2S3 composite as efficient sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdAs one of the most anticipated energy storage systems, the application of lithium-sulfur batteries is hindered by low conductivity of insoluble sulfur species (S8, Li2S2 and Li2S), the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx, 4 = x ≤ 8) and the volume expansion of sulfur species during the cycling. To overcome these barriers, a tunable geometry of flower-like FeMoO4/FeS2/Mo2S3 composite is successfully investigated using simple one-step solvothermal technique. Fe-based sulfides with good conductivity and Mo-based sulfides with the efficient ability of catalytic sulfur species conversion are promising sulfur host for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). It should be noted that this is first time to introduce FeMoO4 as polysulfides anchoring material into the lithium-sulfur system. Consequently, the flower-like composite with 79 wt % sulfur loading exhibits a high initial capacity of 1600 mA h g−1 and a reversible capacity of 781 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 1 C. Even at a high rate of 10 C, a capacity of 421 mAh g−1 is maintained after 300 cycles.",Electrochimica Acta
Fast conversion and controlled deposition of lithium (poly)sulfides in lithium-sulfur batteries using high-loading cobalt single atoms,"© 2020Lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries are appealing energy storage technologies owing to their exceptional energy density. Their practical applications, however, are largely compromised by poor cycling stability and rate capability because of detrimental shuttling of polysulfide intermediates, complicated multiphase sulfur redox reactions, and uncontrolled precipitation of the discharge products (lithium sulfide, Li2S). Herein, monodispersed Co single-atom catalyst on conductive nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet (CoSA-N-C) with high Co content of 15.3 ​wt% was fabricated through a salt-template method and used as a sulfur host material to simultaneously alleviate the polysulfide shuttling, propel the redox kinetics of dissolved polysulfides, and mediate the deposition of Li2S. The robust two-dimensional architecture of CoSA-N-C with large surface area, high porosity, and dual lithiophilic-sulfiphilic Co–N species enable strong physical and chemical polysulfides confinement and fast electrons/ions transfer process. The densely populated Co–N4 coordinated moieties function as electrocatalytic sites to accelerate the reversible conversion between lithium polysulfides and Li2S. Importantly, the CoSA-N-C enables spatially controlled deposition of Li2S nanoparticles during the battery discharge process, as opposed to conventional Li2S passivation layers that fully covered the conductive host. Consequently, the as-fabricated cathodes based on the CoSA-N-C deliver high sulfur utilization (1574 mAh·g−1 at 0.05 ​C), outstanding rate capability (624 mAh g−1 at 5 ​C) and superior long-term stability (capacity fade rate of 0.035% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 1 ​C). Even under a sulfur loading up to 4.9 ​mg ​cm−2, the reversible areal capacity could reach 4.24 mAh cm−2 after 120 cycles at 0.2 ​C, delivering an ultrahigh capacity retention of 91.8%. This work sheds inspiring insights on the important role of single atomic metal with high mass loading in mediating the deposition of lithium sulfides and accelerating the reversible conversion of lithium polysulfides toward decent-performance Li–S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials

Above all, samples made of rod-shaped boehmite exhibited a better degree of orientation (0.21) and a higher fraction of beta"" phase (96 %) than samples made of flake-shaped boehmite. Meanwhile, for samples fabricated with rod-shaped boehmite, the conductivity at 350 ℃ of the sample surface parallel to the uniaxial pressure was nearly 1.5 times (1.634E-1 S cm−1) greater than that of surface perpendicular to the uniaxial pressure.",Journal of the European Ceramic Society
"Vanadium carbide nanoparticles incorporation in carbon nanofibers for room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries: Confining, trapping, and catalyzing","© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries have aroused extensive interest from researchers owing to the high theoretical volumetric energy density, nontoxicity and low-cost.

Herein, we report a three dimensional self-supported structure with Vanadium carbide (VC) nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanofibers for RT Na-S batteries. Finally, the VC-CNFs@S electrode displays a reversible capacity of 379 mAh g−1 after 2000 cycles at 0.5C with a high capacity retention of 96.2%. Such outstanding electrochemical property is ascribed to the “confining – trapping – catalyzing” effect of VC-CNFs structure.",Chemical Engineering Journal
High performance room temperature all-solid-state Na-SexS battery with Na3SbS4–coated cathode via aqueous solution,"© 2020All-solid-state (ASS) Na–S batteries are promising for large-scale energy storage because of the incombustible solid electrolyte and avoiding the dissolution of intermediates. However, the poor contact between the active material and the solid electrolyte in the positive electrode leads to poor electrochemical performance. Here, we report an aqueous solution approach to fabricate Na3SbS4-coated SexS-based active materials for a Na–S battery working at room temperature. Compared with the Na3SbS4 and SexS mixed cathode, the coated cathode achieves significantly improved Na-ion diffusion kinetics and reduced impedance resistance. Additionally, the nanoparticle coating sustains the volume expansion of the cathode during cycling. The resulting batteries deliver an intensively enhanced specific capacity at various rates. Regardless of the mass loading, the Na3SbS4-coated cathode maintains a decent reversible capacity for the long-term discharge/charge cycling. The best battery achieves an initial discharge capacity of 509 mAh g−1 at a current density of 437.4 mA g−1 and capacity retention of 98.9% for 100 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the best room temperature ASS Na–S battery so far. This work demonstrates that Na3SbS4 is very promising for the cathode coating purpose for ASS Na–S batteries.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

Among them, the highest ambient ionic conductivity (1.75 × 10−4 S cm−1) is achieved when M = Si and x = 0.2. The new fast ionic conductor Na3.8[Sn0.67Si0.33]0.8Sb0.2S4 is isostructural to its structure template Na4Sn0.67Si0.33S4 and thus crystallizes in the space group of I41/acd. It is shown that the incorporation of Sb improves the ionic conductivity. The study of lattice parameters shows that the improvement of the ion conductivity by Sb-substitution is mainly due to the enlarged crystal lattice. Furthermore, using Na3.8[Sn0.67Si0.33]0.8Sb0.2S4 as solid electrolytes, room temperature all-solid-state sodium battery of Se0.05S0.95@pPAN/Na3Sn is realized, which proves the novel fast ionic conductor a potential candidate to apply in sodium solid state battery.

Multiregion Janus-Featured Cobalt Phosphide-Cobalt Composite for Highly Reversible Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Electrode materials with high conductivity, strong chemisorption, and catalysis toward polysulfides are recognized as key factors for metal-sulfur batteries. Nevertheless, the construction of such functional material is a challenge for room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries. Herein, a multiregion Janus-featured CoP-Co structure obtained via sequential carbonization-oxidation-phosphidation of heteroseed zeolitic imidazolate frameworks is introduced. The structural virtues include a heterostructure existing in a CoP-Co structure and a conductive network of N-doped porous carbon nanotube hollow cages (NCNHCs), endowing it with superior conductivity in both the short- and long-range and strong polarity toward polysulfides. Thus, the S@CoP-Co/NCNHC cathode exhibits superior electrochemical performance (448 mAh g-1 remained for 700 times cycling under 1 A g-1) and an optimized redox mechanism in polysulfides conversion. Density functional theory calculations present that the CoP-Co structure optimizes bond structure and bandwidth, whereas the pure CoP is lower than the corresponding Fermi level, which could essentially benefit the adsorptive capability and charge transfer from the CoP-Co surface to Na2Sx and therefore improve its affinity to polysulfides.",ACS Nano
Sulfur-Rich (NH4)2Mo3S13as a Highly Reversible Anode for Sodium/Potassium-Ion Batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have attracted much attention owing to the inexpensive Na/K metal and satisfactory performance. Currently, there are still difficulties in research anode materials that can insert/extract Na/K ions quickly and stably. Herein, the sulfur-rich (NH4)2Mo3S13 is proposed as the anode for SIBs/PIBs and is obtained by a hydrothermal method. The sulfur-rich (NH4)2Mo3S13 with a three-dimensional structure shows a high capacity and long lifespans for Na+ (at 10 A g-1 the capacity of 165.2 mAh g-1 after 1100 cycles) and K+ (120.7 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 retained after 500 cycles) storage. In addition, the (NH4)2Mo3S13 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance at low temperatures (0 °C). The mechanism of Na+ storage in (NH4)2Mo3S13 can be innovatively revealed through the combined use of electrochemical kinetic analysis and a series of ex situ characterization tests.

Atomically dispersed metal active centers as a chemically tunable platform for energy storage devices,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Electrochemical energy storage devices play an indispensable role in the exploitation of renewable, clean, and environment-friendly resources. The most preferred route is the use of energy directly. However, the efficiency of energy conversion and storage is dependent on the activity of the electrode catalyst materials. At present, most of the catalyst materials suffer from shortcomings such as low utilization and low activity, which cannot meet the ever-growing demands. Thus, it has become increasingly important to develop a catalyst with high efficiency and improve the coulombic efficiency of electrochemical energy storage devices. Because of the unique electronic and structural features, atomically dispersed (AD) metal active centers exhibit maximum utilization, high active center density, and ultra-high electrochemical activity. In particular, AD metal catalysis has shown excellent performance in electrocatalytic energy conversion and it has also become a new star in other aspects. The present review summarizes the catalytic activity and mechanism with respect to the recent progress in AD metal active centers as a chemically tunable platform for energy storage devices. Furthermore, the current challenges and perspectives of the AD metal research area are discussed.

"Copolymerized Sulfur with Intrinsically Ionic Conductivity, Superior Dispersibility, and Compatibility for All-Solid-State Lithium Batteries","© 2020 American Chemical Society.Elemental sulfur is ionic-insulating and incompatible with most solvents and other additives in the electrode. When it is used in all-solid-state lithium batteries, there is always high resistance to lithium ion transfer, leading to a poor rate and cycle performance. In this work, polymeric sulfur is synthesized to resolve this problem. Sulfur is copolymerized with poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PMEMA) and 1,3-diisopropenylbenzene (DIB). PMEMA is an acrylate monomer, which can undergo radical copolymerization with sulfur diradicals. Its oligoethylene oxide side chain can transfer lithium ions, providing an intrinsic ion-conducting character, good dispersibility, and compatibility for the final polymeric sulfur material, named poly(S-PMEMA-DIB). It is applied to all-solid-state lithium batteries as the positive material, with the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP)/polyethylene oxide (PEO) composite as the all-solid-state electrolyte. Because poly(S-PMEMA-DIB) can disperse well in acetonitrile and shows good compatibility with LAGP, the electrode can be prepared easily with a uniform structure. Also, because of the intrinsically ionic conductivity of this polymeric sulfur, the interfacial resistance of the electrode is reduced. All-solid-state batteries made from poly(S-PMEMA-DIB) demonstrate an improved rate and cycle performance compared with those made from elemental sulfur, delivering high reversible capacities of 1140 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C and 600 mA h g-1 at 0.5 C.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering

In Situ Observation of Sodium Dendrite Growth and Concurrent Mechanical Property Measurements Using an Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy-Atomic Force Microscopy (ETEM-AFM) Platform,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Akin to Li, Na deposits in a dendritic form to cause a short circuit in Na metal batteries. However, the growth mechanisms and related mechanical properties of Na dendrites remain largely unknown. Here we report real-time characterizations of Na dendrite growth with concurrent mechanical property measurements using an environmental transmission electron microscopy-atomic force microscopy (ETEM-AFM) platform. In situ electrochemical plating produces Na deposits stabilized with a thin Na2CO3 surface layer (referred to as Na dendrites). These Na dendrites have characteristic dimensions of a few hundred nanometers and exhibit different morphologies, including nanorods, polyhedral nanocrystals, and nanospheres. In situ mechanical measurements show that the compressive and tensile strengths of Na dendrites with a Na2CO3 surface layer vary from 36 to >203 MPa, which are much larger than those of bulk Na. In situ growth of Na dendrites under the combined overpotential and mechanical confinement can generate high stress in these Na deposits. These results provide new baseline data on the electrochemical and mechanical behavior of Na dendrites, which have implications for the development of Na metal batteries toward practical energy-storage applications.",ACS Energy Letters
A CoO: X /FeOx heterojunction on carbon nanotubes prepared by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition for the highly efficient electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution reactions,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.In this study, FeOx and CoOx thin films were successively and uniformly coated on high-surface-area carbon nanotubes by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition, which formed a heterojunction of the two oxides. As an electrocatalyst in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), CoOx/FeOx/CNTs showed excellent electrocatalytic performance in terms of catalytic activity and stability. The overpotential of CoOx/FeOx/CNTs in OER was only 308 mV at 10 mA cm-2, which was lower than those of the pure oxides: CoOx/CNTs (392 mV) and FeOx/CNTs (406 mV). The as-prepared electrocatalyst also displayed better stability than the reference RuO2 material, with almost no attenuation of current density in contrast to the 10% loss seen with RuO2. The OER performance of CoOx/FeOx/CNTs was superior to those of its oxide components due to the formation of heterojunction, which led to a smoother reaction path and a lower overpotential for OER compared to pure oxides, as supported by the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. These results provide a new direction for the preparation of electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries and water splitting reactions.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

Lithium-ion storage behavior of ZIFs polyhedral carbons with topological structure,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdPolyhedral carbons from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have been studied as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, because their topological feature enabled ideal research objects. However, the similarities and differences of lithium-ion storage behavior between ZIFs polyhedral carbons have not been systematically studied. Here we synthesized four kinds of ZIF-8 polyhedral carbons, including cubes (ZIF-8/C-C), small rhombicuboctahedrons (ZIF-8/C-R1), large rhombicuboctahedrons (ZIF-8/C-R2) and dodecahedrons (ZIF-8/C-D), and well-studied their storage behavior.

Hollow carbon nanospheres: Syntheses and applications for post lithium-ion batteries,"© 2020 the Partner Organisations.Hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNs) have found broad applications in different kinds of electrochemical storage devices. The characteristic hollow structure can endow carbon electrode materials with good reaction kinetics, high mechanical reliance against structural deformation, and powerful capability toward loading functional materials, which makes them particularly interesting for different energy storage systems. In this review, we summarize the recent progresses made in the research of HCNs, focusing on the synthesis strategies and corresponding applications as high-performance electrode materials in post lithium-ion battery (LIB) systems. Besides the widely implemented template-based routes, self-template routes based on the chemical design of polymeric precursors are also introduced. Efforts directed toward the shape evolution mechanism during synthesis, as well as the control capability of different methodologies on the key structural features of HCNs (such as shape, compositions, and architectures), will also be highlighted. Furthermore, we introduce the representative applications of the prepared HCNs in post LIBs, such as lithium-sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and potassium-ion batteries. We attempt to correlate the battery performance with the structural characteristics of HCNs so as to not only make good use of the advantage of shape control, but also facilitate understanding regarding the charge storage mechanism in the newly emerging technologies.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In this study, NiFe2 O4 @Au core–shell nanoparticles were prepared by the direct reduction of gold on the magnetic surface using amino acid methionine as a reducer and a stabilizing agent simultaneously. The obtained nanoparticles after three steps of gold deposition had an average size of about 120 nm. The analysis of particles was performed by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV-Vis spectroscopy techniques. The results indicate successful synthesis of core–shell particles with the magnetic core, which consists of a few agglomerated nickel ferrite crystals with an average size 25.2 ± 2.0 nm, and the thick gold shell consists of fused Au0 nanoparticles (NPs). Magnetic properties of the obtained nanoparticles were examined with magnetic circular dichroism. It was shown that the magnetic behavior of NiFe2 O4 @Au NPs is typical for superparamagnetic NPs and corresponds to that for NiFe2 O4 NPs without a gold shell. The results indicate the successful synthesis of core–shell particles with the magnetic nickel ferrite core and thick gold shell, and open the potential for the application of the investigated hybrid nanoparticles in hyperthermia, targeted drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging, or cell separation.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The effect of the type of dopant (titanium and manganese) and of the reduced graphene oxide content (rGO, 30 or 50 wt %) of the α-Fe2 O3 @rGO nanocomposites on their microstructural properties and electrochemical performance was investigated. Nanostructured composites were synthesized by a simple one-step solvothermal method and evaluated as anode materials for sodium ion batteries. The doping does not influence the crystalline phase and morphology of the iron oxide nanoparticles, but remarkably increases stability and Coulombic efficiency with respect to the anode based on the composite α-Fe2 O3 @rGO. For fixed rGO content, Ti-doping improves the rate capability at lower rates, whereas Mn-doping enhances the electrode stability at higher rates, retaining a specific capacity of 56 mAhg−1 at a rate of 2C.

KGaA, WeinheimDirectly using solar energy to realize photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels is an effective tactics to solve the energy crisis and carbon emission. Although graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been widely studied as a star photocatalyst for CO2 reduction, the extremely fast charge recombination rate seriously limits its performance. Loading suitable co-catalysts to construct an effective junction is considered an efficient way to solve this issue and promote photocatalytic performance. In this work, metallic molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) is dispersed on g-C3N4 nanosheets to construct a Schottky junction photocatalyst. The Schottky junction between MoO2 and g-C3N4 induces efficient charge separation and transfer. As a result, the optimal MoO2/g-C3N4 Schottky junction photocatalyst exhibits a 15 times higher CH4 yield and five times higher CO yield compared with pure g-C3N4.

KGaA, WeinheimSodium metal anode, featuring high capacity, low voltage and earth abundance, is desirable for building advanced sodium-metal batteries. However, Na-ion deposition typically leads to morphological instability and notorious chemical reactivity between sodium and common electrolytes still limit its practical application. In this study, a porous BN nanofibers modified sodium metal (BN/Na) electrode is introduced for enhancing Na-ion deposition dynamics and stability. As a result, symmetrical BN/Na cells enable an impressive rate capability and markedly enhanced cycling durability over 600 h at 10 mA cm−2.

KGaA, WeinheimFe3S4 @ S @ 0.9Na3SbS4⋅0.1NaI composite cathode is prepared through one-step wet-mechanochemical milling procedure. During milling process, ionic conduction pathway is self-formed in the composite due to the formation of 0.9Na3SbS4⋅0.1NaI electrolyte without further annealing treatment. Meanwhile, the introduction of Fe3S4 can increase the electronic conductivity of the composite cathode by one order of magnitude and nearly double enhance the ionic conductivities. Besides, the aggregation of sulfur is effectively suppressed in the obtained Fe3S4 @ S @ 0.9Na3SbS4⋅0.1NaI composite, which will enhance the contact between sulfur and 0.9Na3SbS4⋅0.1NaI electrolyte, leading to a decreased interfacial resistance and improving the electrochemical kinetics of sulfur.

Directly Grown Vertical Graphene Carpets as Janus Separators toward Stabilized Zn Metal Anodes,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimZinc metal anode has garnered a great deal of scientific and technological interest. Nevertheless, major bottlenecks restricting its large-scale utilization lie in the poor electrochemical stability and unsatisfactory cycling life. Herein, a Janus separator is developed via directly growing vertical graphene (VG) carpet on one side of commercial glass fiber separator throughout chemical vapor deposition. A simple air plasma treatment further renders the successful incorporation of oxygen and nitrogen heteroatoms on bare graphene. Thus-derived 3D VG scaffold affording large surface area and porous structure can be viewed as a continuation of planar zinc anode. In turn, the Janus separator harvests homogenous electric field distribution and lowered local current density at the interface of the anode/electrolyte, as well as harnesses favorable zincophilic feature for building-up uniform Zn ionic flux. Such a separator engineering enables an impressive rate and cycle performance (93% over 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1) for Zn-ion hybrid capacitors and outstanding energy density (182 Wh kg−1) for V2O5//Zn batteries, respectively.

Dielectrics and battery studies on flexible nanocomposite gel polymer electrolyte membranes for sodium batteries,"© 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.In the present study, electrochemical impedance analysis in terms of electrical conductivity, dielectric permittivity, and electrical modulus has been carried out of prepared sodium ion-conducting nanocomposite gel polymer electrolyte. To study ion conduction behavior, frequency-dependent AC conductivity has also been analyzed. Dielectric constant (ε′) and dielectric loss (ε′′) as a function of frequency with different nanofiller SiO2 concentrations as well as at different temperatures ranging from 303 to 333 K have been discussed. The low-frequency region showed high values of dielectric constant due to polarization at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Frequency-dependent real (M′) and imaginary part (M′′) of modulus reveal large capacitance associated with it at lower frequency whereas dispersion (conductivity relaxation) at a higher frequency. The tangent loss (tan δ) of the electrolyte systems has been determined for different frequencies and concentrations of fumed silica nanoparticles. The high conducting nanocomposite gel polymer membrane exhibited an electrochemical stability window of ≈ 3.3 V which is sufficient to apply this material as a separator for electrochemical device application. The conductivity, dielectric, modulus, and electrochemical stability studies reveal that sodium ion-conducting nanocomposite gel polymer electrolytes offer good electrochemical properties and are suitable for application in any electrochemical/power conversion device. The optimized flexible nanocomposite gel polymer electrolyte films have been used in a prototype sodium battery, which shows a stable open-circuit potential of ~ 2.1 V and a significant first specific discharge capacity of ~ 500 mAh g−1 at a drain current of 14 mA g−1.",Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics
Mixed phase sodium manganese oxide as cathode for enhanced aqueous zinc-ion storage,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Aqueous zinc-ion batteries have been regarded as a promising alternative to large-scale energy storage, due to associated low-cost, improved safety and environmental friendliness. However, a high-performance cathode material for both rate capability and specific capacity is still a challenge. One kind of the more promising candidates are sodium manganese oxide (NMO) materials, although they suffer from individual issues and need to be further improved. Herein, we present a novel mixed phase NMO material composed of nearly equal amounts of Na0.55Mn2O4 and Na0.7MnO2.05. The structured configuration with particle size of 200–500 nm is found to be beneficial towards improving the ion diffusion rate during the charge/discharge process. Compared with Na0.7MnO2.05 and Na0.55Mn2O4, the mixed phase NMO demonstrates an enhanced rate capability and excellent long-term cycling stability with a capacity retention of 83% after 800 cycles. More importantly, the system also delivers an impressive energy density and power density, as 378 W·h·kg−1 at 68.7 W·kg−1, or 172 W·h·kg−1 at 1705 W·kg−1. The superior electrochemical performance is ascribed to the fast Zn2+ diffusion rate because of a large ratio of capacitive contribution (63.9% at 0.9 mV·s−1). Thus, the mixed phase route provides a novel strategy to enhance electrochemical performance, enabling mixed phase NMO as very promising material towards large-scale energy-storage applications.",Chinese Journal of Chemical Engineering

The first reliable aqueous Zn/polysulfide system activated by a “liquid film” comprising 4-(3-butyl-1-imidazolio)-1-butanesulfoni ionic liquid (IL) encapsulated within PEDOT:PSS. CF3SO3− anions in the IL operating as Zn2+-transfer channels is reported. Moreover, the PEDOT:PSS network retains the IL, which renders Zn2+-transfer channels and a polysulfide cathode with enhanced structural stability.

"A Chronicle Review of Nonsilicon (Sn, Sb, Ge)-Based Lithium/Sodium-Ion Battery Alloying Anodes","© 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSince the commercialization of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in the early 1990s, tin (Sn), antimony (Sb), and germanium (Ge)-based anodes have attracted considerable research interest as promising candidates for next-generation LIBs due to their high theoretical capacities, suitable operating voltages, and natural abundance. Additionally, the awareness of limited global lithium sources promoted the renaissance of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) in recent years. Sn, Sb, and Ge can electrochemically alloy with sodium and are regarded as promising anode candidates for high-performance SIBs. However, these alloying/dealloying anodes suffer severe volume expansion during lithiation or sodiation processes, which is one of the biggest obstacles toward practical applications. In order to solve this problem, several strategies are developed including reducing the absolute size of particles, creating interior void space, and introducing buffer media. After more than two decades' efforts, the electrochemical performance of Sn, Sb, and Ge-based anodes is significantly improved. Considerable studies about Sn, Sb, and Ge-based anodes are summarized in a chronicle perspective and the brief development histories of the three anodes are outlined. With this unique review, light will be shed on the future trends of the studies on the Sn, Sb, and Ge-based anodes for advanced rechargeable batteries.",Small Methods

An artificial metal-alloy interphase for high-rate and long-life sodium–sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Room-temperature sodium–sulfur battery is considered to be a promising candidate for next-generation batteries due to its high theoretical energy density (~1274 ​Wh kg−1) and natural abundance of elements. There are however, a number of concomitant challenges, including large volume change, low ionic conductivity, rapid dendrite growth, and high chemical reactivity, which limit the viability of sodium anodes. Solid electrolyte interphases that address all 4 challenges simultaneously to enable high-rate cycling of sodium anodes remain scarce in the literature. Here we report an artificial metal-alloy interphase (MAI) comprising sodium-tin alloy, which was synthesized using a facile solid-vapor reaction of metallic sodium with tin tetrachloride vapors, instead of using typical liquid electrolytes with tin-based additives (solid-liquid reaction). The MAI was found to facilitate reversible deposition of sodium at relatively high current densities (2–7 ​mA ​cm−2), and allows sodium electrodes to cycle stably for over 650 cycles at 2 ​mA ​cm−2 in sodium symmetric cells. Owing to the unique properties of MAI, such as strong electrode adhesion (to accommodate volume change), high ionic conductivity (to minimize overpotential), high Young's modulus (to suppress dendrite growth), and low electrolyte permeability (to minimize electrolyte reduction), the sodium anode with MAI can endure extended cycling test in sodium–sulfur batteries for over 500 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. This solid-vapor chemistry concept to synthesize MAIs can also be generalized to other material systems such as sodium-silicon and sodium-titanium alloys.",Energy Storage Materials

To this end, rationally designed frameworks for dendrite-free and volume-changeless alkali-metal deposition at both high current densities and capacities are urgently required. Herein, a general 3D conductive Ti3C2TX MXene-melamine foam (MXene-MF) is demonstrated as an elastic scaffold for dendrite-free, high-areal-capacity alkali anodes (Li, Na, K).

Meanwhile, MXene-MF shows flat voltage profiles for 720 h at 10 mA cm-2 for the Na anode and 800 h at 5 mA cm-2 for the K anode, indicative of the wide applicability. Notably, the high current density of 20 mA cm-2 for 20 mAh cm-2 for the Na anode, accompanying good recyclability was rarely achieved before.

In this review, we have reviewed a combination of two highly potential techniques, namely, electrospinning and atomic layer deposition (ALD), in the view of various applications. Over the past 10 years, our research groups are involved in the exploration of employing this combination for a range of applications. We also include some basic information on both the processes and diversity of nanostructures as a result of their combination. Nonwoven nanofiber membranes are excellent candidates for a wide range of applications. Also, they can act as templates to produce various other kinds of nanostructures when combined with ALD in small/large scale production.

New Concepts in Electrolytes,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Over the past decades, Li-ion battery (LIB) has turned into one of the most important advances in the history of technology due to its extensive and in-depth impact on our life. Its omnipresence in all electric vehicles, consumer electronics and electric grids relies on the precisely tuned electrochemical dynamics and interactions among the electrolytes and the diversified anode and cathode chemistries therein. With consumers' demand for battery performance ever increasing, more and more stringent requirements are being imposed upon the established equilibria among these LIB components, and it became clear that the state-of-the-art electrolyte systems could no longer sustain the desired technological trajectory. Driven by such gap, researchers started to explore more unconventional electrolyte systems. From superconcentrated solvent-in-salt electrolytes to solid-state electrolytes, the current research realm of novel electrolyte systems has grown to unprecedented levels. In this review, we will avoid discussions on current state-of-the-art electrolytes but instead focus exclusively on unconventional electrolyte systems that represent new concepts.",Chemical Reviews
Bimetallic MOF-derived CNTs-grafted carbon nanocages as sulfur host for high-performance lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdCarbon materials, especially those with hollow structure, have gained considerable attention as the host materials for sulfur in Li–S batteries. Herein, the nanocages consisting of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hierarchically porous carbon (CNT-NC@GC) are synthesized using bimetallic core-shell metal-organic frameworks as precursor. CNTs are in situ introduced onto the inner/outer surface of the nanocages to form a three-dimensional conductive network throughout the entire electrode for the favorable electrolyte penetration and improved electrons/ions transfer. Abundant N-doping and Co nanoparticles decoration in the tips of CNTs or on the surface of GC shells are beneficial to immobilize soluble polysulfides. Moreover, the modified Co nanoparticles possess chemisorption and electrocatalytic activity for sulfur conversion, which can promote redox kinetics of the polysulfides and improve the cycling stability. As a result, the as-prepared CNTs-grafted nitrogen-doped carbon@graphitic carbon nanocages cathode containing 79.2 wt% of sulfur (CNT-NC@GC/S) delivers a high discharge capacity of 743 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at a current density of 1.0C with a capacity retention of 83.6%. And the cathode with high areal sulfur loading of 4.95 mg cm−2 shows a high areal capacity of 4.01 mA h cm−2 over 100 cycles.",Electrochimica Acta
Highly conductive and nonflammable composite polymer electrolytes for rechargeable quasi-solid-state Li-metal batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Solid-state Li-metal batteries are promising as next-generation energy storage devices. However, the main bottlenecks are the poor conductivity of the solid electrolyte and the high interfacial resistance. While polymers exhibit a lower interfacial resistance in comparison to ceramics, they often require the inclusion of flammable solvents. In this work, highly conductive composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) membranes are prepared by integrating a poly(vinylidene fluoride) matrix (PVDF) with a Li-conductive perovskite (i.e., Li0.38Sr0.44Ta0.70Hf0.30O2.95F0.05, LSTHF), a flame-retarding solvent (i.e., trimethyl phosphate (TMP)), and a Li salt (i.e., LiClO4). The CPE membrane with 10 wt% LSTHF (CPE-10) exhibits conductivities as high as 0.53 mS cm−1 at room temperature (RT) and 0.36 mS cm−1 at 0 °C. Furthermore, prototype batteries, including the CPE-10 electrolyte, show high initial discharge capacities, good rate capabilities, and stable cycling performance at either RT or 5 and 60 °C. This study illustrates that including a Li-conductive perovskite and TMP in a PVDF-based polymer material could yield safe, high-performance quasi-solid-state Li-metal batteries capable of operating over a relatively wide temperature range.",Journal of Power Sources
Quest for magnesium-sulfur batteries: Current challenges in electrolytes and cathode materials developments,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.The emerging energy-storage technologies must meet the requirement of low cost, reasonable safety, high natural abundance, and high energy density. The rechargeable magnesium-sulfur battery (Mg-S) meets these requirements as a new and emerging technology because of its high specific energy (1722 Wh. kg−1) and dendrite free plating/stripping of magnesium anode. However, its performance is restrained by the sluggish magnesium ion diffusions and unavailability of high-voltage magnesium electrolytes compatible with sulfur cathodes. As a result, Mg-S batteries suffer from poor reversible capacity and cycle life. Furthermore, the formation of magnesium polysulfide (Mg-PS) is considered as a biggest R&D challenge for Mg-S batteries. To alleviate these problems, numerous breakthroughs and achievements have been made in the past five years. This review covers the research and development to date on Mg-S systems including working mechanism, development of nucleophilic and non-nucleophilic electrolytes, inorganic electrolyte additives, fabrications of sulfur cathodes, effect of binders, polysulfide confinement via cathode or separator treatments, and in-situ characterizations of electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The electrochemical properties of newly developed Mg-S systems are debated in terms of cell configuration, composition of electrolyte, specific capacity, cycle performance, over potential and working voltages. Furthermore, the current challenges and possible research gaps in Mg-S systems are critically discussed along with future perspectives. We hope this review will revolutionize the deep understanding of Mg-S battery and open the new horizons to develop the highly efficient cathodes and electrolytes in near future.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Ni2P/C nanosheets derived from oriented growth Ni-MOF on nickel foam for enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Tuning the structural features that furnish electrochemically active sites with improved kinetic diffusion can provide an alternative way to achieve high performance of electrocatalysis. Here, we report a nano-structure of Ni2P/C(NPC) nano-sheets supported on nickel foam (NF) that is prepared by sequenced nitrogen pyrolysis and gas phosphatization of Ni-MOF nanosheets. Initially, the passivated surface of nickel foam facilitates the oriented growth of Ni-MOF nanosheets, which is crucial for the maintenance of structure stability during the subsequent pyrolysis and phosphatization treatment. As a result, more catalytic active sites are exposed than the non-oriented NPC catalysts and diffusion kinetics is favorable. Consequently, the obtained composite can exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution catalytic activity in an alkaline electrolyte. For hydrogen evolution reaction, a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is provided at an overpotential of 97 mV and its onset overpotential is only 29 mV. Meanwhile, good morphology and catalytic activity can be maintained after 12 h of stability testing. This excellent performance is believed to be the result of NPC nanosheet structure on NF derived from the facet-oriented control of pristine Ni-MOF, enabling excellent reaction kinetics.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Organic polymeric filler-amorphized poly(ethylene oxide) electrolyte enables all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries operating at 35 °c,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The poor ionic conductivity and high working temperatures (normally >60 °C) of poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) greatly limit their application in all-solid-state batteries. To mitigate these issues, for the first time, we report here an organic polymer filler, hydrolyzed polymaleic anhydride (HPMA), that can greatly suppress PEO crystallinity, enhance the ionic conductivity of PEO-based SPEs (1.13 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 35 °C) and support battery operation at 35 °C. PEO-HPMA SPEs feature high flexibility, incombustibility, wide electrochemical operating window and stability against lithium. The as-derived Li/PEO-HPMA/LiFePO4 all-solid-state batteries show outstanding rate capability, high reversible capacity and long-term stability up to 1250 cycles. More impressively, the soft-packaged Li/PEO-HPMA/LiFePO4 cells show high safety under various extreme conditions such as cutting and perforation. The PEO-HPMA SPE-based quasi-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries are also presented. This work demonstrates a facile approach that unlocks the low-temperature application of PEO SPE-based all-solid-state batteries. This journal is",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Synthesis of Porous Ni-Doped CoSe2/C Nanospheres towards High-Rate and Long-Term Sodium-Ion Half/Full Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimCarbon-layer-coated porous Ni-doped CoSe2 (Ni-CoSe2/C) nanospheres have been fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method followed by a new selenization strategy. The porous structure of Ni-CoSe2/C is formed by the aggregation of many small particles (20–40 nm), which are not tightly packed together, but are interspersed with gaps. Moreover, the surfaces of these small particles are covered with a thin carbon layer. Ni-CoSe2/C delivers superior rate performance (314.0 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1), ultra-long cycle life (316.1 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 8000 cycles), and excellent full-cell performance (208.3 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 70 cycles) when used as an anode material for half/full sodium-ion batteries. The Na storage mechanism and kinetics have been confirmed by ex situ X-ray diffraction analysis, assessment of capacitance performance, and a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). GITT shows that Na+ diffusion in the electrode material is a dynamic change process, which is associated with a phase transition during charge and discharge. The excellent electrochemical performance suggests that the porous Ni-CoSe2/C nanospheres have great potential to serve as an electrode material for sodium-ion batteries.",Chemistry - A European Journal
In Situ Formation of Liquid Metals via Galvanic Replacement Reaction to Build Dendrite-Free Alkali-Metal-Ion Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimGalvanic replacement reactions have been studied as a versatile route to synthesize nanostructured alloys. However, the galvanic replacement chemistry of alkali metals has rarely been explored. A protective interphase layer will be formed outside templates when the redox potential exceeds the potential windows of nonaqueous solutions, and the complex interfacial chemistry remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the formation of room-temperature liquid metal alloys of Na and K via galvanic replacement reaction. The fundamentals of the reaction at such low potentials are investigated via a combined experimental and computational method, which uncovers the critical role of solid-electrolyte interphase in regulating the migration of Na ions and thus the alloying reaction kinetics. With in situ formed NaK liquid alloys as an anode, the dendritic growth of alkali metals can be eliminated thanks to the deformable and self-healing features of liquid metals. The proof-of-concept battery delivers reasonable electrochemical performance, confirming the generality of this in situ approach and design principle for next-generation dendrite-free batteries.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition

However, the shuttle effect of polysulfides and sluggish reaction kinetics severely hinder the development of practical Li–S batteries. Merely depending on an adsorption strategy to resist the shuttle effect is insufficient to boost the overall electrochemical conversion reaction. Recently, single atom catalysts (SACs) have been used to solve this problem by decreasing the energy barriers of sulfur-species interconversion and Li2S decomposition. Herein, the research progress made in using SACs in Li–S batteries is discussed, focusing on their functions and catalytic mechanism. The challenges and prospects for future application of SACs in electrochemical energy-storage systems are also discussed.",ChemSusChem
Enhancing Hydrogen Storage Properties of MgH2 by Transition Metals and Carbon Materials: A Brief Review,"© Copyright © 2020 Sun, Lu, Nyahuma, Yan, Xiao, Su and Zhang.Magnesium hydride (MgH2) has attracted intense attention worldwide as solid state hydrogen storage materials due to its advantages of high hydrogen capacity, good reversibility, and low cost. However, high thermodynamic stability and slow kinetics of MgH2 has limited its practical application. We reviewed the recent development in improving the sorption kinetics of MgH2 and discovered that transition metals and their alloys have been extensively researched to enhance the de/hydrogenation performance of MgH2. In addition, to maintain the cycling property during the de/hydrogenation process, carbon materials (graphene, carbon nanotubes, and other materials) have been proved to possess excellent effect. In this work, we introduce various categories of transition metals and their alloys to MgH2, focusing on their catalytic effect on improving the hydrogen de/absorption performance of MgH2. Besides, carbon materials together with transition metals and their alloys are also summarized in this study, which show better hydrogen storage performance.

"A comprehensive review on energy storage systems: Types, comparison, current scenario, applications, barriers, and potential solutions, policies, and future prospects","© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Driven by global concerns about the climate and the environment, the world is opting for renewable energy sources (RESs), such as wind and solar. However, RESs suffer from the discredit of intermittency, for which energy storage systems (ESSs) are gaining popularity worldwide.

The idea of storing excess energy is not new, and numerous researches have been conducted to adorn this idea with innovations and improvements. This review is a humble attempt to assemble all the available knowledge on ESSs to benefit novice researchers in this field. This paper covers all core concepts of ESSs, including its evolution, elaborate classification, their comparison, the current scenario, applications, business models, environmental impacts, policies, barriers and probable solutions, and future prospects.

Mesoporous Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanospheres as Sulfur Matrix and a Novel Chelate-Modified Separator for High-Performance Room-Temperature Na-S Batteries,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRoom-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT/Na-S) batteries are considered among the most promising next-generation energy storage and conversion systems because of the earth-abundant reserves of sodium and sulfur. These batteries also possess the advantages of high theoretical gravimetric capacity, high energy density, and low cost. Herein, highly uniform Fe3+/polyacrylamide nanospheres (FPNs) are fabricated on a large-scale by a facile, low-cost approach. Subsequently, mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres (PNC-Ns), obtained by carbonizing FPNs, are applied as a sulfur matrix to improve the utilization of sulfur, enhance the overall conductivity of the cathode, and inhibit the shuttling of sodium polysulfides (SPSs). In addition, graphene and FPNs are simultaneously coated onto the side of the separator to form a FPNs-graphene-functionalized separator (FPNs-G/separator); here, the mesoporous FPNs effectively anchor and block the SPSs, while the large specific area graphene sheets eliminate the intrinsic mechanical brittleness of the FPNs and improve the overall conductivity of RT/Na-S batteries. When S/PNC-Ns as a cathode and FPNs-G/separator are assembled into an RT/Na-S battery, it delivers a high discharge capacity (639 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C after 400 cycles), stable cycle life (396 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C after 800 cycles), and good rate performance (228 mAh g-1 at 2 C).",Small
Fundamental Triangular Interaction of Electron Trajectory Deviation and P-N Junction to Promote Redox Reactions for the High-Energy-Density Electrode,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Highly efficient redox reaction of active electrode materials is the guarantee for achieving high energy density for energy storage devices. Here, we design a triangle of the electrode material involving the P-N junction between NiO (p-type) and MoO3 (n-type) and electron trajectory deviation between gold nanoparticles with NiO or MoO3. This optimized fundamental triangle structure could facilitate the redox reaction of a metal oxide, and thus the fabricated ternary nanocomposites exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. At a lower current density (0.5 A g-1), the mass specific capacitance of a single electrode can reach 943.3 F g-1, while the NiO/MoO3 tested under the same conditions only has a specific capacitance of 278.9 F g-1. The assembled asymmetric device with activated carbon shows a higher capacitance retention rate of 98.7% after long-term cycling under different current densities, and a maximum energy density of 28.9 W h kg-1 (power density of 400.1 W kg-1). The crucial prerequisite of this strategy is the lower work function of gold nanoparticles compared with active materials, which significantly reduce the activation energy of NiO/MoO3 and the formed P-N junction between p-type NiO with n-type MoO3 in their contact interfaces. This novel design of a triangle structure could be expected to be applied in other materials to develop a kind of energy storage device with excellent electrochemical performance.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Conversion of Co Nanoparticles to CoS in Metal-Organic Framework-Derived Porous Carbon during Cycling Facilitates Na2S Reactivity in a Na-S Battery,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Roomerature sodium-sulfur batteries have attracted wide interest due to their high energy density and high natural abundance. Polysulfide dissolution and irreversible Na2S conversion are challenges to achieving high battery performance. Herein, we utilize a metal-organic framework-derived Co-containing nitrogen-doped porous carbon (CoNC) as a catalytic sulfur cathode host. A concentrated sodium electrolyte based on sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, dimethoxyethane, and bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether is used to mitigate polysulfide dissolution. We tune the amount of Co present in the CoNC carbon host by acid washing. Significant improvement in reversible sulfur conversion and capacity retention is observed with a higher Co content in CoNC, with 600 mAh g-1 and 77% capacity retention for CoNC and 261 mAh g-1 and 56% capacity retention for acid-washed CoNC at cycle 50 at 80 mAh g-1. Post-mortem X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and selected area electron diffraction suggest that CoS is formed during cycling in place of Co nanoparticles and CoN4 sites. Raman spectroscopy suggests that CoS exhibits a catalytic effect on the oxidation of Na2S. Our findings provide insights into understanding the role Co-based catalysts play in sulfur batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Generalized Domino-Driven Synthesis of Hollow Hybrid Carbon Spheres with Ultrafine Metal Nitrides/Oxides,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.We have demonstrated an ingenious one-pot aqueous domino-driven synthesis toward hollow hybrid spheres with ultrafine metal nitrides/oxides in hollow carbon cavity. The micelle-interfacial copolymerization is applied for shell formation, while the copolymerization-generated H+ spontaneously triggers oxometallate condensation for encapsulation. By regulating the synthetic conditions, the encapsulated metal species can be well tailored with different sizes/contents (nanocluster to several nanometers) and compositions (VN, VO, MoN, WN, bimetal-based nitrides). The ultrafine VN confined in hollow carbon exhibits excellent potassium storage performance. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Hollow hybrid spheres have been the focus of substantial efforts in areas of energy storage/conversion, especially those with carbon shells. However, current synthesis methods require complicated multistep procedures and show inadequate capability to anchor ultrafine particles with compositional complexity and controllable content, thus far restricting the potentials. Here, we report the preparation of hollow hybrid carbon spheres with encapsulated ultrafine metal nitrides/oxides by one-pot domino-driven synthesis, which involves micelle-interfacial copolymerization for shell formation and spontaneous copolymerization-induced oxometallate condensation inside micelles for encapsulation, followed by controlled pyrolysis. The synthetic platform shows remarkable generality and adjustability, enabling full access to multifarious particles with ultrafine size and tunable content. The reduced dimension of the vanadium nitride nanocluster encapsulated in a hollow carbon cavity facilitates surface-dominated potassium storage with superior capacity and high rate performance. The versatile synthesis and manipulation will expand the scope of hollow hybrid material for widespread applications. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Rational encapsulation of ultrafine particles in hollow carbon spheres have been the subject of considerable attention because of their enormous potential in energy storage/conversion, nanoreactors, confined catalysis, and drug delivery. The synthesis mainly relies on template-based selective etching routes or post impregnation, which involve tedious multistep procedures and are incapable of encapsulating ultrafine particles with compositional complexity. Here, we demonstrate a one-pot domino-driven synthesis to overcome these challenges, whereby spontaneous assembly of hollow shell and encapsulation was realized via micelle-interfacial copolymerization and oxometallate condensation.

KGaA, WeinheimLithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely applied and studied as an effective energy supplement for a variety of electronic devices. Titanium dioxide (TiO2), with a high theoretical capacity (335 mAh g−1) and low volume expansion ratio upon lithiation, has been considered as one of the most promising anode materials for LIBs. However, the application of TiO2 is hindered by its low electrical conductivity and slow ionic diffusion rate. Herein, a 2D ultrathin mesoporous TiO2/reduced graphene (rGO) heterostructure is fabricated via a layer-by-layer assembly process.

A Metal Organic Framework Derived Solid Electrolyte for Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) are currently considered as promising candidates for next-generation energy storage technologies. However, their practical application is hindered by the critical issue of the polysulfide-shuttle. Herein, a metal organic framework (MOF)-derived solid electrolyte is presented to address it. The MOF solid electrolyte is developed based on a Universitetet i Oslo (UIO) structure. By grafting a lithium sulfonate (-SO3Li) group to the UIO ligand, both the ionic conductivity and the polysulfide-suppression capability of the resulting -SO3Li grafted UIO (UIOSLi) solid electrolyte are greatly improved. After integrating a Li-based ionic liquid (Li-IL), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, the resulting Li-IL/UIOSLi solid electrolyte exhibits an ionic conductivity of 3.3 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. Based on its unique structure, the Li-IL/UIOSLi solid electrolyte effectively restrains the polysulfide shuttle and suppresses lithium dendritic growth. Lithium–sulfur cells with the Li-IL/UIOSLi solid electrolyte and a Li2S6 catholyte show stable cycling performance that preserves 84% of the initial capacity after 250 cycles with a capacity-fade rate of 0.06% per cycle.",Advanced Energy Materials

This all-solid-state Na-S battery, operating at room temperature, demonstrates a high capacity of 1560 mAh per gram of sulfur (ca. 330 mAh per gram of positive electrode) and a capacity retention of 93% after 50 cycles. Decreasing the size of the S-MSP20 particles coated with Na3SbS4 in a liquid phase process was observed to reduce the volume change of the particles during charge and discharge cycles, which resulted in an excellent electrochemical performance.",Electrochemistry Communications
Toward Green Battery Cells: Perspective on Materials and Technologies,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimResearch and development of advanced rechargeable battery technologies is dominated by application-specific targets, which predominantly focus on cost and performance targets, including high gravimetric energy, volumetric energy, and related power densities, while ensuring a high safety and long lifetime. The need for high-performance and low-cost batteries is driven by the growing market of electromobility, in order to fulfill key requirements, such as a sufficient driving range and fast charging ability, for achieving broad consumer acceptance. Currently, the lithium ion battery (LIB) is one of the state-of-the-art technologies able to meet most of these key requirements at a reasonable cost.

A three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene framework decorated with an atomic layer deposited ultrathin V2O5layer for lithium sulfur batteries with high sulfur loading,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulfur batteries with ultra-high theoretical capacity have gradually become candidates to replace existing energy systems. However, the severe polysulfide shuttle effect hinders their commercialization process. Although using polar materials to modify the electrode for the adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) can improve the cycle stability to a certain extent, it also causes the decline of the overall energy density due to the extra mass. Herein, we decorate three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene (3DNG) with ultra-thin V2O5 coatings (ALDVO@3DNG) on interior surfaces via controllable atomic layer deposition (ALD). The large number of chemisorption sites can firmly anchor LIPSs and inhibit the shuttle effect, while its ultrathin thickness allows the smooth transfer of electrons and promotes the conversion of polysulfides. As a consequence, by controlling the cycles of the ALD process, the optimized ALDVO@3DNG composite delivers an exceptionally great first-cycle discharge capacity of 1555 mA h g-1 at 0.2C, despite the poor conductivity of V2O5. And it exhibits a good cycling stability with an average decay rate of 0.052% at 2C. Even with a high sulfur loading up to 11.5 mg cm-2, the ALDVO@3DNG composite still reaches a great capacity of 1296 mA h g-1 (corresponding to an areal capacity of 14.9 mA h cm-2). This work provides an idea and experimental exploration of applying ALD for the ultrathin modification layer to enhance the electrochemical properties with a low extra weight burden, which may extend to other materials that may be applied in Li-S batteries.

Exclusive Licensee Science and Technology Review Publishing House. Distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0).The shuttle effect hinders the practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries due to the poor affinity between a substrate and Li polysulfides (LiPSs) and the sluggish transition of soluble LiPSs to insoluble Li2S or elemental S. Here, we report that Ni hexatomic clusters embedded in a nitrogen-doped three-dimensional (3D) graphene framework (Ni-N/G) possess stronger interaction with soluble polysulfides than that with insoluble polysulfides. The synthetic electrocatalyst deployed in the sulfur cathode plays a multifunctional role: (i) selectively adsorbing the polysulfides dissolved in the electrolyte, (ii) expediting the sluggish liquid-solid phase transformations at the active sites as electrocatalysts, and (iii) accelerating the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction of multielectron sulfur, thereby inhibiting the dissolution of LiPSs. The constructed S@Ni-N/G cathode delivers an areal capacity of 9.43 mAh cm-2 at 0.1 C at S loading of 6.8 mg cm-2, and it exhibits a gravimetric capacity of 1104 mAh g-1 with a capacity fading rate of 0.045% per cycle over 50 cycles at 0.2 C at S loading of 2.0 mg cm-2. This work opens a rational approach to achieve the selective adsorption and expediting of polysulfide transition for the performance enhancement of Li-S batteries.",Research
Probing the Extent of Polysulfide Confinement Using a CoNi2S4Additive Inside a Sulfur Cathode of a Na/Li-Sulfur Rechargeable Battery,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.The extent of confinement of soluble metal polysulfides inside a sulfur cathode strongly determines the performance of metal-sulfur rechargeable batteries. This challenge has been largely tackled by loading sulfur inside various conducting porous scaffolds. However, this approach has not proven to be fully effective because of poor chemical interaction between the scaffold and polysulfides. Here, we demonstrate an excellent strategy of using a sulfide additive in the sulfur cathode, viz., cobalt nickel sulfide (CoNi2S4), to efficiently trap the soluble polysulfides inside the sulfur cathode. In situ Raman and ex situ UV-vis spectroscopies clearly reveal higher retention of polysulfides inside CoNi2S4/S compared to bare sulfur and carbon-sulfur mixture cathodes. Against sodium, the CoNi2S4/S assembly showed remarkable cyclability both as a function of current density (at room temperature) and temperature (at constant current density). The versatility of CoNi2S4 is further proven by the exemplary cyclability at various current densities at room temperature against lithium.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Electrocatalyzing S Cathodes via Multisulfiphilic Sites for Superior Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries hold great promise for sustainable and cost-effective applications. Nevertheless, it remains a great challenge to achieve high capacity and cycling stability due to the low activity of sulfur and the sluggish conversion kinetics between polysulfide intermediates and sodium sulfide. Herein, an electrocatalyzing S cathode is fabricated, which consists of porous core-shell structure and multisulfiphilic sites. The flexible carbon structure effectively buffers volume changes during cycling and provides enclosed spaces to store S8 with exceptional conductivity. Significantly, the multisulfiphilic sites (ZnS and CoS2) enhance catalysis toward multistep S conversion, which effectively suppresses long-chain polysulfides dissolution and improves the kinetics of short-chain polysulfides. Thus, the obtained S cathodes achieve an enhanced cycling performance (570 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 over 1000 cycles), decent rate capability (250 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 over 2000 cycles), and high energy density of 384 Wh kg-1 toward practical applications.",ACS Nano
Approaching the voltage and energy density limits of potassium-selenium battery chemistry in a concentrated ether-based electrolyte,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Potassium-selenium (K-Se) batteries offer fairly high theoretical voltage (∼1.88 V) and energy density (∼1275 W h kgSe-1). However, in practice, their operation voltage is so far limited to ∼1.4 V, resulting in insufficient energy utilization and mechanistic understanding. Here, it is demonstrated for the first time that K-Se batteries operating in concentrated ether-based electrolytes follow distinctive reaction pathways involving reversible stepwise conversion reactions from Se to K2Sex (x = 5, 3, 2, 1). The presence of redox intermediates K2Se5 at ∼2.3 V and K2Se3 at ∼2.1 V, in contrast with previous reports, enables record-high average discharge plateau voltage (1.85 V) and energy density (998 W h kgSe-1 or 502 W h kgK2Se-1), both approaching the theoretical limits and surpassing those of previously reported Na/K/Al-Se batteries. Moreover, experimental analysis and first-principles calculations reveal that the effective suppression of detrimental polyselenide dissolution/shuttling in concentrated electrolytes, together with high electron conductibility of Se/K2Sex, enables fast reaction kinetics, efficient utilization of Se, and long-term cyclability of up to 350 cycles, which are impracticable in either K-S counterparts or K-Se batteries with low/moderate-concentration electrolytes. This work may pave the way for mechanistic understanding and full energy utilization of K-Se battery chemistry.",Chemical Science
Theoretical identification of layered MXene phase NaxTi4C2O4as superb anodes for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.Rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have great potential as an alternative technology to substitute resource-limited lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, there is a greater safety concern in directly employing metallic sodium as the anode due to sodium being highly active chemically. It is also very challenging to develop SIB electrodes with high capacity as sodium ions are significantly larger and heavier than lithium ions. Here, in this work, we adopted a materials genome approach based on the density functional theory to screen stable phases through intercalating Na+into a standard layered MXene phase of Ti4C2O4. It is highly appealing to note that each of the resultant series of MXene compounds of NaxTi4C2O4(0 ≤x≤ 12) can maintain the layered structure of Ti4C2O4through a fairly large extent of Na+intercalation. The electrochemical potentialvs.Na/Na+is reversely correlated to the Na content: from 2.96 V and 2.40 V for NaxTi4C2O4(1 ≤x≤ 2) down to 0.05 V for Na12Ti4C2O4. The total capacity for Na12Ti4C2O4exceeds 579.00 mA h g−1, and this makes it a very promising high-capacity candidate as an anode for SIBs, since the structural integrity of the battery cells would be readily maintained over discharging/charging cycles. Besides, the O-terminated Ti4C2O4layers are hydrophobic and oxygen-resistant; thus, the intercalated Na would be well protected in ambient processing conditions.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Free-Radical Catalysis and Enhancement of the Redox Kinetics for Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries offer the potential for inexpensive stationary energy storage at the grid and local level. However, their practical performance remains far from theoretical due to sluggish reaction kinetics, which limits both their energy and their rate characteristics. To overcome this, a conceptually new mechanism is demonstrated on the basis of the catalysis by stabilized free-radical species, as indicated by electron spin resonance measurements, generated on the surface of a Na2S6 catholyte-infiltrated activated carbon cloth cathode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal that free-radical catalysis promotes reduction to end-discharged products, via a surface-bound intermediate state, ACC-S3-. Due to this free-radical catalytic activity, our RT Na-S cell achieves a high nominal cell potential of 1.85 V. At a rate of 0.5 C, the Na-S cell delivers a high specific capacity of 866 mA h g(S)-1 and retains 678 mA h g(S)-1 after 700 cycles. The concept of a free-radical mechanism, as described herein, could be adapted to enhance the electrochemical kinetics of other energy storage devices that involve radical intermediate species.",ACS Energy Letters
Research Progress on Sb-based Anode Material for Sodium-ion Batteries 钠离子电池Sb基负极材料的研究进展,"© 2020, Materials Review Magazine. All right reserved.Sb-base anode materials are considered as a promising material for sodium ions batteries (SIBs) and have attracted close attention of researchers, due to its higher theoretical specific capacity and lower cost than carbon materials. Although Sb metal has many advantages such as good safety performance and easy to synthesis, some problems still exist during the repeated charging/discharging processes: (1)due to the larger volume expansion, sodium ions irreversible detaching freely which declines its cycling efficiency; (2)the crystal structure collapse and material pulverization can bring about the cycle stability of electrode materials diminish and the capacity greatly reduce. The electrochemical properties of Sb metal have been greatly enhanced by means of morphology and structure regulation. Even so, it is still unable to effectively solve the problem of low charging and discharging efficiency and rapid capacity decay arisen from volume expansion of Sb metal during cycling. In order to solve this problem, Sb/C composite materials and Sb-base alloy materials were designed and developed. Sb/C composite materials makes use of the advantages of carbon materials, such as good flexibility, excellent conductivity and adjustable morphology and structure, etc, so that the cycling performance of modified electrode material has been improved to some extent. The reaction mechanism of Sb-based non-metallic compound materials, such as Sb oxides and Sb sulfides, is the coexistence of alloying reaction and transformation reaction mechanism, so both can contribute capacity, making such materials have a higher specific capacity. In order to stabilize structural properties and restrain volume expansion at the same time, other composite materials of Sb with complex structure but excellent electrochemical performance can be constructed. In this paper, some common Sb-based(Sb metal, Sb/C compounds, alloy, oxides, sulfides and other composites of Sb)anode materials for SIBs are introduced. Meanwhile, different materials of their storage mechanism of sodium, performance characteristics, existing problems and optimization methods for electrochemical performance are compared and analyzed. It was worth noting that single modification method cannot greatly improve the electrochemistry properties of these materials. A more effective way is to apply various modification methods comprehensively, such as optimum structure, well control of alloy composition as well as select better reducing agents, binders and electrolyte additives, etc. Finally, challenges of Sb-based anode materials for sodium ion batteries and their future commercial application are presented.",Cailiao Daobao/Materials Reports
Ti-Mesh supported porous CoS2nanosheet self-interconnected networks with high oxidation states for efficient hydrogen production: Via urea electrolysis,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an ideal alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) towards energy efficient hydrogen production. However developing Earth-abundant electrocatalysts for urea oxidation and hydrogen generation still remains a big challenge. Herein, porous CoS2 nanosheet self-interconnected networks with high oxidation states located on a Ti-mesh (P-CoS2/Ti) are synthesized and can act as a high activity catalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In this literature, we report a very interesting phenomenon that cobalt hydroxide with different chemical compositions and crystal structures can be synthesized by adjusting the concentration of NaOH during the etching process. Moreover, porous CoS2 nanosheets with different crystallite sizes can be synthesized by adjusting the sulfuration temperature. P-CoS2/Ti presents outstanding catalytic performance with an overpotential of 91 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for the HER, and it gives an anode potential of 1.243 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm-2 for the UOR. A two-electrode electrolyser is used to validate the catalyst performance, and the P-CoS2/Ti||P-CoS2/Ti electrode is capable of producing a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a cell potential of only 1.375 V, demonstrating its potential feasibility in the practical application of efficient hydrogen production.",Nanoscale
High-Rate and Long-Life Intermediate-Temperature Na-NiCl2Battery with Dual-Functional Ni-Carbon Composite Nanofiber Network,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Improved power and cycle performances are eagerly required in intermediate-temperature sodium-metal halide (Na-MH) batteries. The existence of the low conductivity NiCl2 layer and the growth of the Ni and the NaCl particles limit the broader application of Na-NiCl2 battery. Herein, nickel-carbon composite nanofiber (NCCN) networks are synthesized by a multisolution electrospinning method to construct a novel three-dimensional cathode for Na-NiCl2 battery. The battery with the NCCN-based cathode shows significant improvement in rate and cycle performance at 190 °C. A capacity twice that of a conventional electrode after 100 cycles and 80% of the initial capacity after 400 cycles are observed at a current of 57 mA g-1. The NCCN-based cathode normally works more than 350 cycles without obvious degradation at a high current of 338 mA g-1, that is, a rate of 2C. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals faster electron and ion transport processes precisely on the charging and discharging processes of the NCCN-based cathode. It is found that the NCCNs can not only play the role of a continuous conductivity network but also limit the growth of grains. With the blocking effect of the carbon fibers, the volume expansions of Ni and NaCl grains are well restricted and their sizes were smaller than 500 nm and 7 μm after 50 cycles, respectively.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Effect of Crystal Structure and Morphology on Na3V2(PO4)2F3 Performances for Na-Ion Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimNa-ion batteries (SIB) are considered promising systems for energy storage devices, however diversity of available cathode materials is lower compared to lithium ion batteries. Recently, Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) has been demonstrated as promising cathode material for SIB owing to high specific capacity and electrochemical reversibility. However, most of reports demonstrates capacities lower than theoretical value and optimization of electrochemical performances by controlled morphology and crystal structure was not demonstrated yet. Here, we demonstrate a scalable synthesis strategy to tailor the crystal structure and morphology of NVPF and showed that our approach enables to optimize the Na+ ion accommodation, diffusion and stability. A flower morphology (NVPF-F) crystalizes in tetragonal structure, demonstrates discharge capacity of 109.5 mA.h.g−1 and 98.1 % columbic efficiency whereas a hollow spherical morphology (NVPF-S) with orthorhombic structure exhibits discharge capacity of 124.8 mA.h.g−1 (very close to theoretical value) and 99.5 % columbic efficiency. The observed discharge capacity for NVPF-S is highest reported value which is ascribed due to stable crystal structure and monodispersed morphology. Long term stability with negligible capacity loss is demonstrated over 550 cycles. Our findings shed light on importance of crystal structure and morphology of NVPF on electrochemical response, and realization as cathode material for SIB.",Batteries and Supercaps
Bridging the immiscibility of an all-fluoride fire extinguishant with highly-fluorinated electrolytes toward safe sodium metal batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Room-temperature sodium metal batteries with metallic Na anodes and flammable organic solvent-based electrolytes are breeding severe safety concerns. Herein, by introducing non-flammable, highly-fluorinated ethers as bridge solvents, we enable superior miscibility of an all-fluoride fire extinguishant into fluorinated carbonate electrolytes. Besides the intrinsic non-flammability of the designed electrolyte, the embedded PFMP extinguishant further enhances the battery safety by its efficacy to in situ dissipate the internal heat at an elevated temperature (ΔH = +88.1 J g-1). Moreover, the cyclability is greatly improved by using such an electrolyte. The Na/Na symmetrical cells can cycle for 1100 h at 1.0 mA h cm-2 and more than 800 h at 5.0 mA h cm-2. Paired with a high voltage Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode, the full cell exhibits a high initial coulombic efficiency of 94.7% and a capacity retention of 87.1% after 1000 cycles at 0.5C, which is mainly ascribed to the thin F-rich interphases established on both the Na metal anode and the cathode.",Energy and Environmental Science
From Liquid- to Solid-State Batteries: Ion Transfer Kinetics of Heteroionic Interfaces,"© 2020, The Author(s).Abstract: Hybrid battery cells combining liquid electrolytes (LEs) with inorganic solid electrolyte (SE) separators or different SEs and polymer electrolytes (PEs), respectively, are developed to solve the issues of single-electrolyte cells. Among the issues that can be solved are detrimental shuttle effects, decomposition reactions between the electrolyte and the electrodes, and dendrite propagation. However, the introduction of new interfaces by contacting different ionic conductors leads to other problems, which cannot be neglected before commercialization is possible. The interfaces between the different types of ionic conductors (LE/SE and PE/SE) often result in significant charge-transfer resistances, which increase the internal resistance considerably. This review highlights studies evaluating the interfacial resistances and activation barriers in such systems to present an overview of the issues still hampering hybrid battery systems. The interfaces between different SEs in hybrid all-solid-state batteries (SSBs) are considered as well. In addition, a short summary of physicochemical models describing heteroionic interfaces—interfaces between two different ion conductors—is given in an attempt to explain high interface resistances. In doing so, we hope to inspire future work on the crucial topic of interface optimization toward better SSBs. Graphic Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Electrochemical Energy Reviews
Recent developments and future challenges in designing rechargeable potassium-sulfur and potassium-selenium batteries,"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).The use of chalcogenide elements, such as sulfur (S) and selenium (Se), as cathode materials in rechargeable lithium (Li) and sodium (Na) batteries has been extensively investigated. Similar to Li and Na systems, rechargeable potassium-sulfur (K-S) and potassium-selenium (K-Se) batteries have recently attracted substantial interest because of the abundance of K and low associated costs. However, K-S and K-Se battery technologies are in their infancy because K possesses overactive chemical properties compared to Li and Na and the electrochemical mechanisms of such batteries are not fully understood. This paper summarizes current research trends and challenges with regard to K-S and K-Se batteries and reviews the associated fundamental science, key technological developments, and scientific challenges to evaluate the potential use of these batteries and finally determine effective pathways for their practical development.",Energies
"Covalent Encapsulation of Sulfur in a MOF-Derived S, N-Doped Porous Carbon Host Realized via the Vapor-Infiltration Method Results in Enhanced Sodium–Sulfur Battery Performance","© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimPractical applications of room temperature sodium–sulfur batteries are still inhibited by the poor conductivity and slow reaction kinetics of sulfur, and dissolution of intermediate polysulfides in the commonly used electrolytes. To address these issues, starting from a novel 3D Zn-based metal–organic framework with 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid and 1,4-bis(pyrid-4-yl) benzene as ligands, a S, N-doped porous carbon host with 3D tubular holes for sulfur storage is fabricated. In contrast to the commonly used melt-diffusion method to confine sulfur physically, a vapor-infiltration method is utilized to achieve sulfur/carbon composite with covalent bonds, which can join electrochemical reaction without low voltage activation. A polydopamine derived N-doped carbon layer is further coated on the composite to confine the high-temperature-induced gas-phase sulfur inside the host. S and N dopants increase the polarity of the carbon host to restrict diffusion of sulfur, and its 3D porous structure provides a large storage area for sulfur. As a result, the obtained composite shows outstanding electrochemical performance with 467 mAh g−1 (1262 mAh g−1(sulfur)) at 0.1 A g−1, 270 mAh g−1 (730 mAh g−1(sulfur)) after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 and 201 mAh g−1 (543 mAh g−1(sulfur)) at 5.0 A g−1.",Advanced Energy Materials
1T′-ReS2 Nanosheets In Situ Grown on Carbon Nanotubes as a Highly Efficient Polysulfide Electrocatalyst for Stable Li–S Batteries,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe practical viability of Li–S cells depends on achieving high electrochemical utilization of sulfur under realistic conditions, such as high sulfur loading and low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio. Here, metallic 2D 1T′-ReS2 nanosheets in situ grown on 1D carbon nanotubes (ReS2@CNT) via a facile hydrothermal reaction are presented to efficiently suppress the “polysulfide shuttle” and promote lithium polysulfide (LiPS) redox reactions. The designed ReS2@CNT nanoarchitecture with high conductivity and rich nanoporosity not only facilitates electron transfer and ion diffusion, but also possesses abundant active sites providing high catalytic activity for efficient LiPS conversion. Li–S cells fabricated with ReS2@CNT exhibit high capacity with superior long-term cyclability with a capacity retention of 71.7% over 1000 cycles even at a high current density of 1C (1675 mA g−1). Also, pouch cells fabricated with the ReS2@CNT/S cathode maintain a low capacity fade rate of 0.22% per cycle. Furthermore, the electrocatalysis mechanism is revealed based on electrochemical studies, theoretical calculations, and in situ Raman spectroscopy.",Advanced Energy Materials
Anodes and Sodium-Free Cathodes in Sodium Ion Batteries,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe increase in electricity generation poses growing demands on energy storage systems, thus offering a chance for the success of the reliable and cost-effective energy storage technologies. Sodium ion batteries are emerging as such a technology, which is however not yet mature enough to enter the market. At the crux of building practical sodium ion batteries is the development of electrode materials that promise sufficient cost- and performance-competitiveness. As such, herein, all typical sodium storage materials are discussed, considering their fabrication methods and sodiation mechanisms in detail. A comprehensive cross-literature and cross-material comparison, which also includes the related thermodynamic analysis of their sodiation products, is also provided. The review focusses particularly on anodes and sodium-free cathodes, as they both play the role of the acceptor rather than the donor of sodium ions in their operation in batteries; their difference lies in the (de-)sodiation voltage. In the discussion, special attention is paid to contradictory observations and interpretations in contemporary sodium ion battery research, since debates on these controversies are likely to fuel future sodium battery research.",Advanced Energy Materials
Tellurium: A High-Volumetric-Capacity Potassium-Ion Battery Electrode Material,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimCurrently, exploring high-volumetric-capacity electrode materials that allow for reversible (de-)insertion of large-size K+ ions remains challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode for storage of K+ ions due to its high volumetric capacity, confirmed in lithium-/sodium-ion batteries, and the intrinsic good electronic conductivity. However, the charge storage capability and mechanism of Te in potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) have not been unveiled until now. Here, a novel K–Te battery is constructed, and the K+-ion storage mechanism of Te is revealed to be a two-electron conversion-type reaction of 2K + Te ↔ K2Te, resulting in a high theoretical volumetric capacity of 2619 mAh cm−3. Consequently, the rationally fabricated tellurium/porous carbon electrodes deliver an ultrahigh reversible volumetric capacity of 2493.13 mAh cm−3 at 0.5 C (based on Te), a high-rate capacity of 783.13 mAh cm−3 at 15 C, and superior long-term cycling stability for 1000 cycles at 5 C. This excellent electrochemical performance proves the feasibility of utilizing Te as a high-volumetric-capacity active material for storage of K+ ions and will advance the practical application of KIBs.",Advanced Materials
Ultrastable Sodium–Sulfur Batteries without Polysulfides Formation Using Slit Ultramicropore Carbon Carrier,"© 2020 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaAThe formation of the soluble polysulfides (Na2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) causes poor cycling performance for room temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries. Moreover, the formation of insoluble polysulfides (Na2Sn, 2 ≤ n < 4) can slow down the reaction kinetics and terminate the discharge reaction before it reaches the final product. In this work, coffee residue derived activated ultramicroporous coffee carbon (ACC) material loading with small sulfur molecules (S2–4) as cathode material for RT Na–S batteries is reported. The first principle calculations indicate the space confinement of the slit ultramicropores can effectively suppress the formation of polysulfides (Na2Sn, 2 ≤ n ≤ 8). Combining with in situ UV/vis spectroscopy measurements, one-step reaction RT Na–S batteries with Na2S as the only and final discharge product without polysulfides formation are demonstrated. As a result, the ultramicroporous carbon loaded with 40 wt% sulfur delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 1492 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g−1). When cycled at 1 C rate, the carbon–sulfur composite electrode exhibits almost no capacity fading after 2000 cycles with 100% coulombic efficiency, revealing excellent cycling stability and reversibility. The superb cycling stability and rate performance demonstrate ultramicropore confinement can be an effective strategy to develop high performance cathode for RT Na–S batteries.",Advanced Science
A Ternary Hybrid-Cation Room-Temperature Liquid Metal Battery and Interfacial Selection Mechanism Study,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe dendrite-free sodium–potassium (Na–K) liquid alloy composed of two alkali metals is one of the ideal alternatives for Li metal as an anode material while maintaining large capacity, low potential, and high abundance. However, Na- or K-ion batteries have limited cathode materials that can deliver stably large capacity. Combining advantages of both, a hybrid-cation liquid metal battery is designed for a Li-ion-insertion-based cathode to deliver stable high capacity using a Na–K liquid anode to avoid dendrites. The mechanical property of the Na–K alloy is confirmed by simulation and experimental characterization, which leads to stable cycling performance. The charge carrier selection principle in this ternary hybrid-cation system is investigated, showing consistency with the proposed interfacial layer formation and ion distribution mechanism for the electrochemical process as well as the good stability. With Li ions contributing stable cycling as the cathode charge carrier, the K ion working as charge carrier on the anode, and Na as the medium to liquefy K metal, such a ternary hybrid battery system not only inherits the rich battery chemistry of Li-insertion cathodes but also broadens the understanding of alkali metal alloys and hybrid-ion battery chemistry.",Advanced Materials
Review of Emerging Potassium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThis is the first review on potassium–sulfur (K–S) batteries (KSBs), which are emerging metal battery (MB) systems. Since KSBs are quite new, there are fundamental questions regarding the electrochemistry of S-based cathode and of K metal anode, as well as the holistic aspects of full-cell performance. The manuscript begins with a critical discussion regarding the potassium–sulfur electrochemistry and on how it differs from the much better-known lithium–sulfur. Cathodes are discussed next, focusing on the role of sulfur structure, carbon host chemistry and porosity, and electrolytes in establishing the reversible potassium sulfide K2Sn phase sequence, the parasitic polysulfide shuttle, pulverization-driven capacity fade, etc. Following is a discussion of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs), including of hybrid solid–liquid systems that show much promise. Potassium metal anodes are then critically reviewed, emphasizing electrolyte reactions to form stable versus unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), covering the current understanding of potassium dendrites, and highlighting the deep-eutectic K–Na alloying approaches for room temperature liquid anodes. The manuscript concludes with K–S batteries, focusing on cell architectures and providing quantitative performance comparisons as master plots. Unanswered scientific/technological questions are identified, emerging research opportunities are discussed, and potential experimental and simulation-based studies that can unravel these unknowns are proposed.",Advanced Materials
Cobalt single atoms supported on N-doped carbon as an active and resilient sulfur host for lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur chemistry is currently being explored as a mechanism for electricity storage because it promises high energy capacities and low costs. However, practical applications of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are severely limited by the short cycle life caused by the polysulfide shuttling (PSS) effect. Herein, we report on a PSS-resistant yet redox-active sulfur host containing N-doped carbon dodecahedra supported cobalt single atoms (denoted as Co–SAs@NC) derived from a binary Co–Zn MOF-precursor. The results show that the sulfur cathode built on the Co–SAs@NC is electrocatalytically active towards soluble-polysulfides-to-insoluble-Li2S conversion, thus mitigating the detrimental PSS effect. The LSB using this new sulfur host exhibits a 600-cycle stable operation with a capacity of 737 mAh g−1 at 1C and 2.0 ​mg ​cm−2 S-loading. At a higher sulfur loading of 5.0 ​mg ​cm−2, it can still deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1069 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and maintain 400 mAh g−1 at 1C for 150 cycles. Theoretical analysis suggests that the Co–N4 moiety in the Co–SAs@NC is fundamentally responsible for the observed activity and stability.",Energy Storage Materials
Melt-salt-assisted direct transformation of solid oxide into atomically dispersed FeN4 sites on nitrogen-doped porous carbon,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdEmerging heterogeneous catalysts with metal atomically dispersed on supports (tentatively termed single-atom catalysts, SACs) exhibit many appealing features in a wide variety of catalytic reactions, such as high activity and nearly 100% atom utilization. However, the synthesis of SACs currently requires not only multiple procedures but also appropriate precursors with special structures. Herein, the molten-salt assistance is presented as an effective means that enables the use of common metal oxides (such as Fe2O3 and Co2O3) and small organic molecules as precursors for the preparation of carbon-supported SACs through one-pot pyrolysis. Molten salts as templates that can be easily removed after synthesis also contribute to the formation of porous and nitrogen-doped carbon with a high specific area. More importantly, benefiting from the strong polarizing force of molten salts, the ionic bonds in oxides can be destabilized at high temperature. Subsequently, metal ions released from solid oxides are transformed into atomically dispersed active sites after being trapped by nitrogen (N) atoms on the carbon support. The as-prepared SAC with atomically dispersed Fe–N4 sites demonstrates high activity, outstanding stability and good methanol tolerance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both alkaline and acidic media.",Nano Energy
"Octahedral core–shell bimetallic catalysts M@UIO-67 (M = Pt–Pd nanoparticles, Pt–Pd nanocages): Metallic nanocages that enhanced CO2 conversion","© 2020 Elsevier LtdZr-based metal–organic framework catalysts M@UIO-67 (M = Pt–Pd nanoparticles, Pt–Pd nanocages) were assembled using branched Pt–Pd nanoparticles (Pt–PdNPs) or Pt–Pd nanocages (Pt–PdNCs) as cores in UIO-67, and the conditions were controlled to fabricate one-to-one core-shell composites: one Pt–Pd nanoparticle in one UIO-67 nano-octahedron. Compared with Pt–PdNPs@UIO-67, the catalyst Pt–PdNCs@UIO-67 exhibited higher CO2 conversion (26.88%) for the reverse water–gas shift reaction, the superior performance can be attributed to the hollow structure of Pt–Pd nanocages.",Applied Materials Today
Co-N-C in porous carbon with enhanced lithium ion storage properties,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Carbon materials as promising anodes for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted great attentions owing to their high theoretical capacities and rich natural resources. To improve anode performance of carbon, several common strategies have been developed, such as the fabrication of carbon with various nanostructures and modification of carbon frameworks by heteroatoms doping. Besides, the introduction of transition metal single atom or atom clusters embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks is also a feasible route.

In this work, a nitrogen-doped graphene-ionic liquid-glassy carbon microsphere paste electrode (N-GE/GCILE) was constructed for the determination of Qu. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) were employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of Qu. In comparison with unmodified glassy carbon microsphere paste electrode, the modified electrode exhibited better electrocatalytic activity towards Qu. The influencing conditions on sensitivity such as the amount of modifier, accumulation potential and time, and electrolyte pH value were respectively discussed. Under the optimized conditions, two linear ranges of 0.002- 0.1 μM and 0.1–10 μM were obtained, with a detection limit of 1 nM (S/N = 3). The method was applied in Qu determination in blueberry juice with the recoveries of 102.5–105.0%.",Microchemical Journal
Mg2+ conducting polymer gel electrolytes: physical and electrochemical investigations,"© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.In this work, magnesium ion conducting polymer gel electrolytes based on PVdF-HFP and EC/DEC have been prepared using solution casting technique. Physical and electrochemical investigations have been carried out with a view to understand the effect of magnesium triflate salt concentration within the polymer gel electrolyte. The physical investigations include X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements to probe changes in structural/morphological, thermal, and spectroscopic properties. In order to investigate the dielectric behavior of the electrolyte system, real part of the permittivity and dielectric loss are discussed as a function of frequency, salt concentration, as well as temperature. The modulus behavior of the electrolyte system has been studied by plotting the real and imaginary part as a function of frequency and temperature. The reported Mg2+ ion conducting electrolyte offers predominant ionic character with total ion transport number close to unity. Perhaps these magnesium ion conducting polymer gel electrolytes are suitable for application in electrochemical device, especially in magnesium-based batteries.",Ionics
Interface engineering by atomically thin layer tungsten disulfide catalyst for high performance Li–S battery,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdOwing to high aspect ratio of edge sites and superior catalytic activity, atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) show great promise to tailor the electrolyte/electrode interface properties for high performance lithium-sulfur battery (Li–S battery). However, the TMDCs that engineer the electrode/electrolyte interface are usually produced through chemical hydrothermal methods, which show low crystallinity and thick multilayer structure. Herein, a highly crystalline and atomically thin tungsten disulfides on carbon cloth (WS2@CC) was developed via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and served as an effective electrode/electrolyte interface for Li–S battery. Our results demonstrate that the atomically thin WS2 with high crystal quality and abundant edges sites can effectively accelerates the redox kinetics of sulfur/lithium polysulfides and regulates the precipitation/decomposition of insoluble Li2S. More importantly, it was revealed that the hierarchical flower-stacked WS2 with excessive exposed catalytic edges shows extremely strong polysulfide adsorption, which causes the sulfur species aggregation and passivation on the WS2@CC surface, thus resulting in deformed rate performance and poor cycling stability as compared to the few-layer WS2@CC. Our work provides a new insight into the structural engineering of TMDCs by CVD for Li–S battery, and suggests the importance of rational chemisorption and catalysis of the interface to realize the high-performance Li–S battery.",Materials Today Energy
Theoretical Insights into the Charge and Discharge Processes in Aluminum-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.With the limited number of studies available (mostly experimental), the field of aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) batteries is in urgent need of understanding their complex electrochemical reactions. Herein, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used to obtain a detailed understanding of the involved charging and discharging processes in Al-S batteries by analysis of interfacial systems S8(001)/[EMIM]AlCl4 and Al2S3(001)/[EMIM]AlCl4-electrolyte, respectively. We observe that during the discharging process, the reduction of S8 follows a layer-by-layer mechanism and involves the formation of various cationic and anionic intermediate species, which drives the formation of Al polysulfides during the course of the discharging process. The evolution of the discharge voltage profile studied over a limited timescale shows two voltage domains: the first voltage domain (1.87-2.10 V) corresponds to the interface effects of surface-electrolyte and second the voltage domain of 1.38-1.50 V starts coinciding with the experimental value of 1.30 V and involves the reduction of S8 to higher-order polysulfides. We also observe the diffusion of these higher-order Al polysulfides to the electrolyte, which is in accordance with the experimentally observed solvation of higher-order Al poylsulfides into the electrolyte. The evolution of the atomistic structure and reaction voltage during charging shows that the top atomic sublayer structural distortions are mainly limited to the layer where Al atoms are removed and not the other inner atomic layers, which could be the reason for the poor electrochemical reversibility and an increased overall charging voltage (1.75 V) in experimentally studied Al-S batteries. We believe that the new atomistic insights obtained about the formation of various intermediate species, competition of different reaction mechanisms, and importance of local Al concentration could help improve the understanding of the complex electrochemical processes observed in Al-S batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Atomic-scale identification of influencing factors of sodium dendrite growth on different current collectors,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.To design high-performance and safe Na metal anodes for rechargeable Na-metal batteries, the dendrite-growth mechanisms during the Na electroplating process need to be fully understood. Here, we provided a density functional theory (DFT) insight into essential mechanisms associated with Na dendrite formation on different current collectors, such as Cu, Al, and single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We investigated the adsorption behavior of Na atoms on SWCNTs, Cu (111) surfaces, and Al (111) surfaces and further compared the stability of Na dimers. The ""sodiophilic"" properties and electronic configuration of Cu, Al, and SWCNTs were evaluated. Meanwhile, the electron transfer and the stability of Na dimers were estimated. For the adsorption of a single Na atom, the SWCNT, Cu and Al performed well with adsorption energies of -2.15, -2.93 and -2.24 eV, respectively. However, the Na dimer was not energetically favorable to form on SWCNTs. Based on Hirshfeld atomic charges and electron density distribution, the stable electron configuration of the SWCNT was found to play a critical role in dispersing Na adatoms. In addition, the vacancy defects in the SWCNT induced better ""sodiophilic"" properties and inhibited dendrite growth. Our results unraveled the possible mechanisms underlying dendritic electrodeposition of Na on SWCNTs, Cu and Al current collectors, indicating that SWCNTs can be a promising current collector to develop dendrite-free Na metal anodes for safe Na-metal batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
"Garnet-Type Solid-State Electrolytes: Materials, Interfaces, and Batteries","© 2020 American Chemical Society.Solid-state batteries with desirable advantages, including high-energy density, wide temperature tolerance, and fewer safety-concerns, have been considered as a promising energy storage technology to replace organic liquid electrolyte-dominated Li-ion batteries. Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) as the most critical component in solid-state batteries largely lead the future battery development. Among different types of solid-state electrolytes, garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid-state electrolytes have particularly high ionic conductivity (10-3 to 10-4 S/cm) and good chemical stability against Li metal, offering a great opportunity for solid-state Li-metal batteries. Since the discovery of garnet-type LLZO in 2007, there has been an increasing interest in the development of garnet-type solid-state electrolytes and all solid-state batteries. Garnet-type electrolyte has been considered one of the most promising and important solid-state electrolytes for batteries with potential benefits in energy density, electrochemical stability, high temperature stability, and safety. In this Review, we will survey recent development of garnet-type LLZO electrolytes with discussions of experimental studies and theoretical results in parallel, LLZO electrolyte synthesis strategies and modifications, stability of garnet solid electrolytes/electrodes, emerging nanostructure designs, degradation mechanisms and mitigations, and battery architectures and integrations. We will also provide a target-oriented research overview of garnet-type LLZO electrolyte and its application in various types of solid-state battery concepts (e.g., Li-ion, Li-S, and Li-air), and we will show opportunities and perspectives as guides for future development of solid electrolytes and solid-state batteries.",Chemical Reviews
Layer-Spacing-Enlarged MoS2 Superstructural Nanotubes with Further Enhanced Catalysis and Immobilization for Li-S Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.A layer-spacing-enlarged MoS2 nanotube (LE-MoS2) consisting of hierarchical superstructural nanosheets (-MoS2-carbon layer-MoS2-) was fabricated and served as the sulfur host. The (002) lattice plane of LE-MoS2 is greatly expanded to 1.04 nm and 67.7% higher than that of the conventional 2H-MoS2. Benefitting from the layer-spacing-enlarged hierarchical superstructure of LE-MoS2, the catalytic effect on the S(s)-Li2Sx (soluble, x > 6)-Li2Sy (soluble, y > 2)-Li2S(s) phase transformation kinetics and immobilizing effect on the soluble Li2Sy in Li-S batteries are both further enhanced and demonstrated by in situ X-ray adsorption near-edge structure spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The formation of hierarchical superstructural nanosheets was carefully investigated by customized synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry.",ACS Nano
"Sodium Bis(oxalato)borate in Trimethyl Phosphate: A Fire-Extinguishing, Fluorine-Free, and Low-Cost Electrolyte for Full-Cell Sodium-Ion Batteries","Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Sodium-ion batteries based on all-naturally abundant elements, in which no cobalt, nickel, copper, and fluorine is used, can lead to a major breakthrough in making batteries more sustainable. Safety aspects - in particular, flammability of electrolytes - in the state-of-the-art battery technology is another important concern, especially for applications in which large numbers of cells are employed. Nonflammable battery electrolytes studied so far are based on highly fluorinated compounds or high salt concentrations, which suffer from high cost and toxicity. We here propose an electrolyte based on a single solvent and low-cost and fluorine-free salt at a lower range of ""standard"" concentrations. Our results show - for the first time - that sodium bis(oxalato)borate (NaBOB) is soluble in the nonflammable solvent trimethyl phosphate (TMP). This finding enables a nonflammable electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and promising electrochemical performance in full-cell sodium-ion batteries. An electrolyte of 0.5 M NaBOB in TMP provides an ionic conductivity of 5 mS cm-1 at room temperature, which is comparable to the commonly used electrolytes based on sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and organic carbonate solvents. The proposed electrolyte shows a Coulombic efficiency of above 80% in the first cycle, which increased to about 97% from the second cycle in sodium-ion battery full-cells consisting of a hard carbon anode and a Prussian white cathode. This work opens up opportunities to design safe electrolytes which can further be optimized with electrolyte additives such as vinylene carbonate for industrial applications.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Aminomethyl-Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes as a Host of Small Sulfur Clusters for High-Performance Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimHere we propose an effective strategy to stabilize small sulfur species by using aminomethyl-functionalized carbon nanotubes (AM-CNT) without impairing the conductive channel of the carbon nanotube (CNT) cathode. The linear Sn clusters can be anchored strongly to the AM-CNT for the favorable size of n=5 and the maximum size of n=6 in the production of the cathode, which depresses the mass loss of active sulfur effectively and eliminates the formation of high-order polysulfides completely during the discharge process. The most stable 3 D cross-linked Inter-S5-AM-CNT network shows a fast electron transfer redox reaction through the CNT skeleton that possesses a theoretical capacity of 1337 mA h g−1 (based on sulfur) or 592 mA h g−1 (based on the cathode). The discharge products of the linear S5 cluster tend to form a hyperbranched tight structure through N⋅⋅⋅S⋅⋅⋅Li bridges that are fully impregnated in the AM-CNT bundles, and thus stabilize the entire system. Importantly, this study provides vital guidance into how to design cathodes based on small sulfur clusters for Li-S batteries to depress the shuttle effect intrinsically during charge–discharge cycles, which can be extended to the other small-sulfur-cluster-based batteries.",ChemSusChem
Incorporating Diamondoids as Electrolyte Additive in the Sodium Metal Anode to Mitigate Dendrite Growth,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.Owing to the high abundance and gravimetric capacity (1165.78 mAh g−1) of pure sodium, it is considered as a promising candidate for the anode of next-generation batteries. However, one major challenge needs to be solved before commercializing the sodium metal anode: The growth of dendrites during metal plating. One possibility to address this challenge is to use additives in the electrolyte to form a protective solid electrolyte interphase on the anode surface. In this work, we introduce a diamondoid-based additive, which is incorporated into the anode to target this problem. Combining operando and ex situ experiments (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, optical characterization, and cycling experiments), we show that molecular diamondoids are incorporated into the anode during cycling and successfully mitigate the growth of dendrites. Furthermore, we demonstrate the positive effect of the additive on the operation of sodium-oxygen batteries by means of increased energy density.",ChemSusChem
Hexagonal boron nitride induces anion trapping in a polyethylene oxide based solid polymer electrolyte for lithium dendrite inhibition,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.Here we prepare a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)-polyethylene oxide composite polymer electrolyteviaa convenient casting method, which shows high mechanical strength. Meanwhile, the electrochemical properties (electrochemical window and lithium ion transference number) are enhanced but the ionic conductivity of the h-BN composite electrolyte is decreased after adding h-BN. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results show that a stronger binding effect is observed between TFSI-and BN, compared to that between Li+and BN. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are also utilized to study the mechanism behind the enhanced Li ion diffusion by h-BN addition. Li+diffusion in PEO/LiTFSI/BN is lower than that in the PEO/LiTFSI system, but the diffusion of TFSI-exhibits a more significant decline rate in the presence of BN. This indicates that the presence of BN suppresses anion motion and enhances selectivity in Li+transport. Thus, the PEO/LiTFSI/h-BN composite electrolyte exhibits higher Li ion conductivity but lower anion diffusivity than the PEO/LiTFSI system. Hence the h-BN composite polymer electrolyte in a Li/Li symmetric battery provides a long cycling time of 430 h at 0.2 mA cm-2. A Li metal/LiFePO4full battery with the PEO/LiTFSI/h-BN composite electrolyte also works more efficiently for long-term cycling (140 cycles) than a filler-free PEO based electrolyte (39 cycles).",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
A Biphasic Interphase Design Enabling High Performance in Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 The Author(s)Room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries possess higher specific energy and improved inherent safety compared to their high-temperature analogs used in stationary grid storage. The viability of room temperature sodium batteries depends critically on the mechanical and ionic transport properties of the solid electrolyte interphase. However, little emphasis has been placed on developing sodium anode interphases that combine high Young's modulus (stiffness), high critical strain (ductility), and low ionic diffusion barrier for cycling at high rates. Here, we report an artificial biphasic interphase comprising two chemically distinct phases, NaOH and NaNH2, which combines high stiffness and high ductility. In addition, the biphasic interphase exhibits a low diffusion barrier for sodium ions, enabling reversible sodium plating and stripping behavior even at extremely high current densities (up to 50 mA cm−2) in symmetric cell configuration. Stable and reversible cycling of a room temperature sodium-sulfur battery is also demonstrated over 500 cycles. © 2020 The Author(s)Metal anode batteries typically lack a stable solid electrolyte interphase, causing the metal anode to grow dendrites, which eventually leads to cell failure. Kumar et al. report an artificial biphasic interphase combining high mechanical and electrochemical stability, which is found to be favorable in extending the cycle life and rate capability of sodium anodes.",Cell Reports Physical Science
TMDs beyond MoS2 for Electrochemical Energy Storage,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAtomically thin sheets of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted interest as high capacity electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage devices owing to their unique properties (high surface area, high strength and modulus, faster ion diffusion, and so on), which arise from their layered morphology and diversified chemistry. Nevertheless, low electronic conductivity, poor cycling stability, large structural changes during metal-ion insertion/extraction along with high cost of manufacture are challenges that require further research in order for TMDs to find use in commercial batteries and supercapacitors. Here, a systematic review of cutting-edge research focused on TMD materials beyond the widely studied molybdenum disulfide or MoS2 electrode is reported. Accordingly, a critical overview of the recent progress concerning synthesis methods, physicochemical and electrochemical properties is given. Trends and opportunities that may contribute to state-of-the-art research are also discussed.",Chemistry - A European Journal
Bipolarization of cathode particles as underlying mechanism for voltage hysteresis and the first charge cycle overvoltage of intercalation batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdUnderstanding the mechanisms at the basis of the charge/discharge characteristics of cathode materials is mandatory for lithium-ion and post-lithium-ion batteries optimal development. Here, we theoretically propose bipolarization of cathode particles, as a noble governing mechanism for charge-discharge behaviors, capable to justify many phenomena including the voltage hysteresis (VH) and the first-charge cycle overvoltage, etc. The here proposed original approach is based on previous models, simple concepts and experimental evidences. After representation of the approach, two important phenomena are explained in view of it. The first charge cycle overvoltage is justified by the bipolarization mechanism. VH phenomenon is caused by bipolarization and subsequently neutralization of the particles. Ab-initio calculations are used to estimate VH values based on the approach and the results are in agreement with our experiments. Our approach sheds light on the relevant characteristics of cathode materials cycling properties and allows designing strategies for optimization of the characterizations by controlling and engineering the mechanism. As practical results, different parts of V-C curvature and their corresponding reactions could be distinguished. Accordingly, a new assessment field is opened to determine quality of the cathode powder, electrode preparation and cell assembling. This paper is a foundation to justify other observed phenomena including memory-effect, voltage overshooting, beginning/ending of (dis)charge curvatures and different obtained voltage for one cathode etc.",Electrochimica Acta

Dense Sandwich-like Na2Ti3O7@rGO Composite with Superior Performance for Sodium Storage,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) has been considered as a promising anode in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its low working voltage, high energy density and low cost. However, low electronic and ionic conductivity become the major obstacles to affect the improvement of its electrochemical performance. Here, based on the high specific surface area and high conductivity of reduced graphene oxides (rGO), a dense sandwich-like structure was built through a facile hydrothermal route. The Na2Ti3O7@rGO (NTO@rGO) composites have a stable two-dimensional conductive network framework and the Na2Ti3O7 particles grow in situ on the surface of the rGO nanosheets, greatly improving the utilization of rGO by reducing the introduction of rGO. Moreover, when the NTO@rGO was used as an anode for SIBs, it showed an excellent cycle stability and rate performance with 137 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 500 cycles and 92 mA g−1 at 2 A g−1, respectively.",ChemElectroChem
Enabling remarkable cycling performance of high-loading MoS2@Graphene anode for sodium ion batteries with tunable cut-off voltage,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Layer-structured transition-metal disulfides are considered as promising anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, large volume change over charge-discharge cycles is behind a major problem for mechanical failure, leading to low capacity, poor rate and cycling performance. In this work, we devise a one-step solvothermal method to construct reduced graphene oxide (RGO) aerogel containing nano-roses made of few-layer MoS2 petals, which exhibit significant enlargement in inter-layer spacing. Such MoS2@RGO composites are applied as SIBs anode to facilitate remarkable improvement of rate capacity (513.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 171.5 mAh g−1 at high current density 20 A g−1) and cycling stability (>80% capacity retention, 223.2 mAh g−1, after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g−1). Furthermore, theoretical calculations are employed to study the sodiation/de-sodiation mechanisms, which guide realization of high cycling stability beyond 1000 cycles, through applying a positive discharge cut-off voltage above 0.4 V to keep the layered structures from decomposition.",Journal of Power Sources
Carbon-wrapped cobalt nanoparticles on graphene aerogel for solid-state room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery has attracted more and more widespread attention on account of the low cost, high capacity and reliable efficiency. Nevertheless, how to further improve sulfur reactivity and high-rate cycling performance remains challenging. Herein, carbon-wrapped nanocobalt anchored on graphene aerogel is fabricated to resolve low sulfur reactivity, conductivity and the large volumetric expansion during the charge/discharge process. The novel sulfur composite cathode shows up an initial discharge capacity of 572.8 mAh g−1 at 5C with an extremely low average capacity fading of 0.01% per cycle from 200 to 1000 cycles. Significantly, the cathode is also used for assembling solid-state Na/S batteries, with an initial discharge capacity of 484.9 mAh g−1 at 0.5C and a retainion capacity of 226 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles. This outstanding performance is ascribed to the electrocatalytic effects of the nanocobalt and the conductive and flexible graphene aerogel, which can effectively enhance chemical reaction kinetics and accommodate the fast volume change.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Sodium-Storage Behavior of Exfoliated MoS2as an Electrode Material for Solid-State Batteries with Na3PS4as the Solid Electrolyte,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.MoS2 nanosheets prepared by chemical exfoliation are studied as electrode materials for sodium solid-state batteries (Na-SSBs). Sodium thiophosphate (Na3PS4) is used as the solid electrolyte and is synthesized by high-energy ball milling. The stability of Na3PS4 in contact with the Na metal and a Na-Sn alloy is compared, with the latter showing more favorable properties. The configuration of the Na-SSB is Na-Sn|Na3PS4|(MoS2, Na3PS4, carbon) with the positive electrode containing 60 wt % MoS2, 30 wt % Na3PS4, and 10 wt % carbon. Assuming full conversion, the theoretical capacity of MoS2 is 670 mA h g-1 (5 mA h cm-2), but only a fraction is achieved in the experiment. Cells are cycled at 33.5 mA g-1 at temperatures of 22, 40, and 60 °C for which initial discharge capacities of 243, 319, and 373 mA h g-1 are found. The increase in capacity can be linked to a decrease in resistance as determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results are compared with analogue Li-SSBs (as recently discussed, see http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b01816) and the corresponding cells with a liquid electrolyte. Although SSBs show lower capacity compared to cells with the liquid electrolyte, their initial coulomb efficiency is much higher. For both electrolytes, the capacity in the case of sodium is smaller compared to lithium. All cells show a voltage hysteresis typical for conversion reactions. Interestingly, the volume expansion of the MoS2 electrode in the SSBs during initial sodiation/lithiation is about 70% in both cases, indicating that the discharge capacity is limited by mechanical constraints. Nevertheless, the redox activity of MoS2 electrodes is demonstrated over 100 cycles at different temperatures, with capacities exceeding most previous studies on the use of metal sulfides in Na-SSBs.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C

Yttrium-Sodium Halides as Promising Solid-State Electrolytes with High Ionic Conductivity and Stability for Na-Ion Batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.All-solid-state sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage applications. To build such a battery system, efficient solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with high sodium ionic conductivity at room temperature and good electrochemical stability as well as interface compatibility are required. In this work, using density functional theory combined with molecular dynamics simulation and a phase diagram, we have studied the potential of yttrium halide-based materials (Na3YX6, where X = Cl or Br) with inherent cation vacancies as diffusion carriers for solid electrolytes in ASIBs. A great balance between electrochemical stability and ionic conductivity found in these two systems overcomes the shortcomings of sulfide- and oxide-based SSEs. In particular, these two materials show Na+ conductivities of 0.77 and 0.44 mS cm-1 at 300 K and wide electrochemical windows of 0.51-3.75 and 0.57-3.36 V, and good interfacial stability with Na metal anode and high-potential polyanion (fluoro)phosphate cathode materials, respectively. These features make halide-based materials promising efficient solid-state electrolytes for Na-ion batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters

We report a facile synthesis of Cu1.75S/Cu1.8S microspheres assembled with mesoporous nanosheets and their application in sodium-ion batteries. This unique structure is obtained by a simple reaction of Cu2O octahedra and Na2S in an optimized molar ratio of 1-2.5 in an aqueous solution at room temperature without any other capping agents and chemicals. It is revealed that roxbyite Cu1.75S has preferential growth along the c direction leading to nanosheets with highly exposed (008) facets.

Material and Interfacial Modification toward a Stable Room-Temperature Solid-State Na-S Battery,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature solid-state sodium batteries have the remarkable potential to simultaneously achieve high safety, high energy density, and low cost. However, their current performance is far below expectations. Through material and interfacial modification based on Na3PS4 solid electrolytes, progress is made toward stable room-temperature solid-state sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries. First, the ionic liquid N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Pyr14FSI) is employed to modify the anode/electrolyte interface. An overpotential of 0.55 V after 900 h of a symmetrical battery indicates enhanced interfacial stability. A stable in situ solid electrolyte interphase layer is formed at the interface of NaSn alloy and Na3PS4, proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, selenium-doped sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (Se0.05S0.95@pPAN) is used to boost the ionic and electronic conductivities of the sulfur cathode. As a result, the Na-S battery using a Se0.05S0.95@pPAN cathode and the interfacial modification delivers stable cycle performance and enhanced rate capability.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Development and challenge of advanced nonaqueous sodium ion batteries,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdRoom-temperature nonaqueous rechargeable sodium ion batteries (SIBs) were first studied in 1980s, which had undergone rapid revival since 2010 and could be considered as the most promising candidate for alternative to lithium ion batteries (LIBs) because of their similar chemistry and the abundant sodium reserves.

Metal chalcogenides for potassium storage,"© 2020 The Authors. InfoMat published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of UESTC.Potassium-based energy storage technologies, especially potassium ion batteries (PIBs), have received great interest over the past decade. A pivotal challenge facing high-performance PIBs is to identify advanced electrode materials that can store the large-radius K+ ions, as well as to tailor the various thermodynamic parameters. Metal chalcogenides are one of the most promising anode materials, having a high theoretical specific capacity, high in-plane electrical conductivity, and relatively small volume change on charge/discharge. However, the development of metal chalcogenides for PIBs is still in its infancy because of the limited choice of high-performance electrode materials. However, numerous efforts have been made to conquer this challenge. In this article, we overview potassium storage mechanisms, the technical hurdles, and the optimization strategies for metal chalcogenides and highlight how the adjustment of the crystalline structure and choice of the electrolyte affect the electrochemical performance of metal-chalcogenide-based electrode materials. Other potential potassium-based energy storage systems to which metal chalcogenides can be applied are also discussed. Finally, future research directions focusing on metal chalcogenides for potassium storage are proposed. (Figure presented.).",InfoMat
Stable Sodium Metal Batteries via Manipulation of Electrolyte Solvation Structure,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium metal batteries have attracted rapidly rising attention due to their low cost and high energy densities. However, the instability and low efficiency of metallic sodium anodes pose significant concerns for their practical applications. Here a highly stable sodium metal anode enabled by an ether-based electrolyte is reported, which exhibits a long-term stable cycling up to 400 cycles and achieves an unprecedentedly average Coulombic efficiency of over ≈99.93%. It is revealed that the organic/inorganic hybrid structure containing B–O species and NaF in the ultrathin solid-electrolyte interphase layer plays the key role for the outstanding electrochemical performances. Furthermore, a Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell successfully achieves a stable cycling performance that paves the way for the development of sodium metal batteries.",Small Methods
Carbon-Microcuboid-Supported Phosphorus-Coordinated Single Atomic Copper with Ultrahigh Content and Its Abnormal Modification to Na Storage Behaviors,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimCarbon-supported single atomic metals (SAMs) have aroused great interest in energy conversion and storage fields. However, metal content has to date, been far below expectation. Additionally, theoretical calculations show that SAMs are superb anchoring sites for alkali metal-ion storage, but the experimental research remains untouched. Herein, a metal–organophosphine framework derived strategy is proposed to prepare carbon microcuboids-supported single atomic Cu with a high content of 26.3 wt%. Atomic Cu is stabilized mainly by P moieties, exhibiting robust stability even in concentrated HCl and HNO3. Interestingly, experimental investigations and first-principle calculations indicate that Cu atoms can alter the Na storage behavior and enable Na to maintain an ionic state at a fully discharging state for sodium-ion batteries, which may be a new pathway to mitigate safety concerns of dendrite formation. The Cu atoms also enhance electron transfer and diffusion kinetics. As a result, the carbon cuboids can deliver a high capacity of 107.7 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 and show a long life of 1000 cycles for Na storage. This strategy offers a new possibility for fabricating high-content P-coordinated atomic metals for energy conversion and storage.",Advanced Energy Materials
Gradiently Sodiated Alucone as an Interfacial Stabilizing Strategy for Solid-State Na Metal Batteries,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAll-solid-state metal batteries (ASSMBs) are attracting much attention due to their cost effectiveness, enhanced safety, room-temperature performance and high theoretical specific capacity. However, the alkali metal anodes (such as Li and Na) are active enough to react with most solid-state electrolytes (SSEs), leading to detrimental reactions at the metal–SSE interface. In this work, a molecular layer deposition (MLD) alucone film is employed to stabilize the active Na anode/electrolyte interface in the ASSMBs, limiting the decomposition of the sulfide-based electrolytes (Na3SbS4 and Na3PS4) and Na dendrite growth. Such a strategy effectively improves the room-temperature full battery performance as well as cycling stability for over 475 h in Na–Na symmetric cells. The modified interface is further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling, which provides spatially resolved evidence of the synergistic effect between the dendrite-suppressed sodiated alucone and the insulating unsodiated alucone. The coupled layers reinforce the protection of the Na metal/electrolyte interface. Therefore, alucone is identified as an effective and bifunctional coating material for the enhancement of the metal/electrolyte interfacial stability, paving the way for rapid development and wide application of high-energy ASSMBs.",Advanced Functional Materials

KGaA, WeinheimFor sodium (Na)-rechargeable batteries to compete, and go beyond the currently prevailing Li-ion technologies, mastering the chemistry and accompanying phenomena is of supreme importance. Among the crucial components of the battery system, the electrolyte, which bridges the highly polarized positive and negative electrode materials, is arguably the most critical and indispensable of all.

Thus, the full-scale appraisal of both tailored electrolytes and the concomitant interphases generated at the electrodes need to be prioritized. The deployment of large-format Na-based rechargeable batteries also necessitates systematic evaluation and detailed appraisal of the safety-related hazards of Na-based batteries. Hence, this review presents a comprehensive account of the progress, status, and prospect of various Na+-ion electrolytes, including solvents, salts and additives, their interphases and potential hazards.",Advanced Energy Materials

KGaA, WeinheimThe fabrication of sulfur-containing carbonaceous anode materials (CS) that show exceptional activity as anode material in Na-ions batteries is reported. To do so, a general and straightforward bottom-up synthesis of CS materials with precise control over the sulfur content and functionality is introduced. The new synthetic path combined with a detailed structural analysis and electrochemical studies provide correlations between i) the sulfur content and chemical species and ii) the structural, electronic, and electrochemical performance of the associated materials.

Electrochemical performance of Bi2Te3 heterostructure thin film and Cu7Te4 nanocrystals on undoped and In3+-doped WO3 films for energy storage applications,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdWe demonstrated the synthesis of undoped and In3+-doped WO3 as an electron acceptor for energy storage applications, by utilizing the electrochemical S2− insertion/extraction process at the heterostructure of rhombohedral Bi2Te3 thin films and hexagonal Cu7Te4 nanocrystals. The cyclic voltammetry of heterostructured electrodes with and without In3+ doping both showed Faradic pseudo-capacitance behavior based on the oxidation and reduction processes. The largest exchange current density of 3.43 mA/cm2 was obtained for the heterojunction-structured-Bi2Te3 thin films and Cu7Te4 nanocrystals with In3+ doping in the WO3 electrode. This implies more favorable hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics and higher electrocatalytic activity at the anode. The highest specific capacity of 90.2 mA h/g was obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV/s, with the power density reaching 1.7 kW/kg at the highest energy density value of 18.85 Wh/kg for the In3+-doped electrode. The overall results revealed the inherent properties of the new electrode materials, as well as their potential use in energy storage devices or in future electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications involving hydrogen (or oxygen) evolution reactions.",Electrochimica Acta
Progress in electrolytes for beyond-lithium-ion batteries,"© 2020The constant increase in global energy demand and stricter environmental standards are calling for advanced energy storage technologies that can store electricity from intermittent renewable sources such as wind, solar, and tidal power, to allow the broader implementation of the renewables. The grid-oriented sodium-ion batteries, potassium ion batteries and multivalent ion batteries are cheaper and more sustainable alternatives to Li-ion, although they are still in the early stages of development. Additional optimisation of these battery systems is required, to improve the energy and power density, and to solve the safety issues caused by dendrites growth in anodes. Electrolyte, one of the most critical components in these batteries, could significantly influence the electrochemical performances and operations of batteries. In this review, the definitions and influences of three critical components (salts, solvents, and additives) in electrolytes are discussed. The significant advantages, challenges, recent progress and future optimisation directions of various electrolytes for monovalent and multivalent ions batteries (i.e. organic, ionic liquid and aqueous liquid electrolytes, polymer and inorganic solid electrolytes) are summarised to guide the practical application for grid-oriented batteries.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
Sulfur-nitrogen rich carbon as stable high capacity potassium ion battery anode: Performance and storage mechanisms,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Combined sulfur and nitrogen (S ​= ​12.9 ​at.%, N ​= ​9.9 ​at.%) rich carbons are synthesized for potassium ion anode applications. The low-surface-area carbons (56 ​m2 ​g−1) have sulfur covalently bonded to the structure, with minimum unbound “free” sulfur. This allows for exceptional rate capability and stability: Capacities of 437, 234 and 72 mAh g−1 are achieved at 0.1, 1 and 10 ​A ​g−1, with 75% retention at 2 ​A ​g−1 after 3000 cycles. These are among the most favorable capacity-cyclability combinations reported in potassium ion battery carbon literature. As a proof of principle, the carbons are incorporated into a potassium ion capacitor with state-of-the-art energy and power (e.g. 110 ​W ​h ​kg−1 at 244 ​W ​kg −1). According to XPS analysis, the reaction of nitrogen with K+ is distinct from that of K+ with sulfur. The N and N–O moieties undergo a series of complex multi-voltage reactions that result in both reversible and irreversible changes to their structure. The K–S reactions involve a combination of reversible adsorption and reversible formation of sulfides, thiosulfate and sulfate. GITT and EIS analysis indicate that incorporation of S into the N-rich carbon increases the K+ solid-state diffusion coefficient by factors ranging from ~3 to 8, depending on the voltage. The diffusivities are asymmetric with charging vs. discharging, signifying distinct reaction pathways. The covalently bound sulfur also has a positive influence on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, at early and at prolonged cycling.",Energy Storage Materials
Scalable production of nitrogen-doped carbons for multilayer lithium-sulfur battery cells,"© 2020Lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries are among the targeted candidates for future generation secondary batteries with high specific energy. Herein, a scalable synthesis is presented to produce highly porous, nitrogen-doped carbons from a commercial carbon black material by melamine impregnation and subsequent thermolysis. The process up-scaling up was demonstrated at > 100 g batch level. The nitrogen doping was controlled through pyrolysis temperatures and carbon to melamine ratio. The sulfur-carbon cathodes exhibit an enhanced cycle life at a moderate electrolyte to sulfur ratio of 7 μL mgS −1. In particular, under lean conditions at low electrolyte amount of 5 μL mgS −1, the nitrogen functionalities improved active material utilization and capacity retention significantly. The nitrogen-doped scaffold was integrated into five-layered prototype cell (71 × 46 mm2) with a capacity of up to 0.87 Ah reaching a specific energy density of 238 Wh kg−1 on stack level. These results provide new insights into realistic application of nitrogen-doped carbons on pouch cell level.",Carbon
Transition metal chalcogenide anodes for sodium storage,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdOwing to the low cost and indefinite availability of sodium resources, rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are now being considered as the most appealing alternatives to their lithium-ion counterparts for large scale applications. On the other hand, transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have emerged as potential candidates of SIB anodes due to their versatile material species, ample abundance, low cost, robust nature and high theoretical capacities. However, TMCs still face several challenges like severe volume changes during sodiation/desodiation, inadequate conductivities and large-scale productions. Hence, many traditional and unconventional techniques have been developed to mitigate these issues and obtain high quality electrode materials for practical applications. In this review, recent progress and the rectification stratagems of the problems of TMCs have been summarized firstly. Then, a detailed comparison of transition metal selenides with sulfide TMCs family members was provided to investigate the factors which govern the relative performance improvements of selenides. Besides this, multiple transition metals containing TMCs (M-TMCs) have exhibited intriguingly better performances compared to mono-metal TMCs. Hence, various inspirational features of M-TMCs were discussed. As an outcome of these discussions, we were able to outline several outlooks and prospective solutions for the rectification of potential challenges of TMC anode materials.",Materials Today
"Constructing mesoporous hollow polysulfane spheres bonded with short-chain sulfurs (Sx, x≤3) as high-performance sulfur cathodes in both ether and ester electrolytes","© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Although organic polysulfanes are promising cathodes for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries because of the covalently bonded sulfur to suppress the shuttle effect, those with linear polymer substrates tend to generate long-chain sulfurs (Sx, x ​= ​4–16) that is liable to yield soluble lithium polysulfides and thus could not effectively prevent the shuttle effect. Herein, novel mesoporous hollow sulfurized aminophenol-formaldehyde resin (polysulfane)/carbon nanotube (SAC) spheres with covalently linked short-chain sulfurs (Sx, x ​≤ ​3) are synthesized using a self-template polymerization reaction followed by dissolution and vulcanization processes. The three-dimensional network of aminophenol-formaldehyde resin, the mesoporous hollow structure, and the vulcanization temperature benefit the formation of the short-chain sulfurs (Sx, x ​≤ ​3), suppressing the shuttle effect efficiently. The ex-situ analyses confirm that the unlithiated part of C–S bond could boost the electrochemical kinetics of delithiated reaction. Therefore, the as-prepared SAC cathode exhibits excellent rate performances and high reversible capacities at varied densities, even obtaining a superior structure stability and a very stable cyclability with a loss as low as 0.022% per cycle within 1000 cycles at 2 ​C. Moreover, the SAC could perform stably both in ester and the ether electrolytes.",Energy Storage Materials
Design Strategies to Enable the Efficient Use of Sodium Metal Anodes in High-Energy Batteries,"© 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium-based batteries have attracted considerable attention and are recognized as ideal candidates for large-scale and low-cost energy storage. Sodium (Na) metal anodes are considered as one of the most promising anodes for next-generation, high-energy, Na-based batteries owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (1166 mA h g−1) and low standard electrode potential. Herein, an overview of the recent developments in Na metal anodes for high-energy batteries is provided. The high reactivity and large volume expansion of Na metal anodes during charge and discharge make the electrode/electrolyte interphase unstable, leading to the formation of Na dendrites, short cycle life, and safety issues. Design strategies to enable the efficient use of Na metal anodes are elucidated, including liquid electrolyte engineering, electrode/electrolyte interface optimization, sophisticated electrode construction, and solid electrolyte engineering. Finally, the remaining challenges and future research directions are identified.

Remedies for Polysulfide Dissolution in Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRechargeable room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT-NaS) batteries represent one of the most attractive technologies for future stationary energy storage due to their high energy density and low cost. The S cathodes can react with Na ions via two-electron conversion reactions, thus achieving ultrahigh theoretical capacity (1672 mAh g−1) and specific energy (1273 Wh kg−1). Unfortunately, the sluggish reaction kinetics of the nonconductive S, severe polysulfide dissolution, and the use of metallic Na are causing enormous challenges for the development of RT-NaS batteries.

Designing High Ionic Conducting NASICON-type Na3Zr2Si2PO12 Solid-Electrolytes for Na-Ion Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.The present work investigates the synthesis and characteristics of a Na super-ionic conductor-type Sc3+-and Yb3+-doped Na3Zr2Si2PO12 solid electrolyte for application in solid-state Na-ion batteries. A significant improvement of Na-ion conductivity in Na3Zr2Si2PO12 has been achieved through crystal engineering and microstructure refinement. The presence of the monoclinic-ZrO2 impurity phase adversely affecting the Na-ion conductivity is eliminated using the cubic-ZrO2 precursor at the place of monoclinic-ZrO2 in the conventional solid-state reaction method. Utilizing cubic-ZrO2 also refined the microstructure with thin and microcrack-free grain boundaries. A replacement of 16.5 at. % of Zr4+ by Sc3+ in Na3Zr2Si2PO12 enhances the roomerature total ionic conductivity from 0.61 to 0.96 mS·cm-1. Replacing 11.11 at. % of Sc3+ by Yb3+ further improves the roomerature ionic conductivity to 1.62 mS·cm-1, which is >2.5 times higher than that of bare Na3Zr2Si2PO12. The strategic approach used to raise the ionic conductivity in the current work can be applied to other materials, paving way toward realizing high-performance solid-electrolytes for viable and economic Na-ion batteries. A roomerature conductivity of 1.51 mS·cm-1 for Sc3+/Yb3+-doped Na3Zr2Si2PO12 measured employing Na metal as electrodes confirms Na-ion conduction. Furthermore, a very low current density (∼10-7 A/cm2) in the cyclic-voltammetry profile of the Na|solid-electrolyte|Na cell demonstrates the suitability of Sc3+/Yb3+-doped Na3Zr2Si2PO12 as a solid-electrolyte for Na-ion batteries. A detailed analysis of these materials has been performed, and the possible reasons for the conductivity enhancement are discussed.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
"Covalent sulfur embedding in inherent N,P co-doped biological carbon for ultrastable and high rate lithium-sulfur batteries","© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are attracting extensive interest owing to their low cost and potential for applications in high-density energy storage systems. However, their widespread application is severely plagued by poor cycling stability, inferior rate capability and low coulombic efficiency, which are largely attributed to the shuttling effect of soluble polysulfides. Herein, we report an architecture of an N,P co-doped biological carbon-based covalent sulfur composite (NP@BCCSC), which acts as a cathode for highly robust Li-S batteries. The NP@BCCSC can not only buffer the volume expansion of sulfur during the charge/discharge process, but also shows strong absorption towards soluble polysulfides, which can effectively suppress the shuttling effect. As a cathode for Li-S batteries, the NP@BCCSC with a sulfur content of 20.1% exhibits a reversible capacity of 1190 mA h g-1 (all specific capacities are calculated based on the mass of sulfur) at a current density of 500 mA g-1 after 500 cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of approximately 100%. Moreover, the NP@BCCSC offers a highly robust cycling stability (an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.0024% per cycle during 15,000 consecutive cycles) and an excellent rate capability (high specific capacity of 920 mA h g-1 even at a current density of 10,000 mA g-1), indicating its great potential for applications in future energy storage systems.",Nanoscale
High-density Fibrous Polyimide Sponges with Superior Mechanical and Thermal Properties,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.A relatively low compressive strength significantly limits the practical application of sponges made from electrospun fibers because of an ultralow density <10 mg/cm3. To solve this problem, fibrous polyimide sponges with high density (HDPISG) were prepared using a ""self-gluing""concept. The HDPISG have a density of up to 280 mg/cm3 and porosity >80%, and showed good breathability. The compressive strength increased significantly as the sponge densities increased. The HDPISG with a density of 280 mg/cm3 has the highest compressive strength of 5190 and 35,900 kPa under 50 and 80% compression, respectively. The small HDPISG can even hold weights more than ten thousand times of the weight of the sponge. The HDPISG also possess excellent mechanical properties after thermal treatments and no loss of compressive strength can be seen after heating at 300 °C for 30 h. Further study indicates that the HDPISG can maintain their main shape after carbonization.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Dendrite-Free Sodium Metal Anodes Enabled by a Sodium Benzenedithiolate-Rich Protection Layer,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium metal is an ideal anode material for metal rechargeable batteries, owing to its high theoretical capacity (1166 mAh g−1), low cost, and earth-abundance. However, the dendritic growth upon Na plating, stemming from unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film, is a major and most notable problem. Here, a sodium benzenedithiolate (PhS2Na2)-rich protection layer is synthesized in situ on sodium by a facile method that effectively prevents dendrite growth in the carbonate electrolyte, leading to stabilized sodium metal electrodeposition for 400 cycles (800 h) of repeated plating/stripping at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. The organic salt, PhS2Na2, is found to be a critical component in the protection layer. This finding opens up a new and promising avenue, based on organic sodium slats, to stabilize sodium metals with a protection layer.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Spherical sodium metal deposition and growth mechanism study in three-electrode sodium-ion full-cell system,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered to be promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the greater natural abundance of sodium raw materials versus lithium raw materials. However, to date, the plating and stripping mechanism of Na metal in full SIBs, which is one of the functional reactions in SIBs, has yet to be clarified. Herein, we systematically investigate the influence of current density on the nature of Na-metal deposition in a full-cell SIB using a three-electrode system composed of a commercial NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode, a hard carbon (HC) anode, and a Na-metal reference electrode. Using electrochemical methods and ex situ electron microscopy, it is found that the deposition of Na metal increases with increasing current and plates on the HC anode in a spherical shape; the above morphology is in contrast to the dendrite-like morphology of Li plated onto graphite. Using first-principles calculations, it is discovered that the suppression of dendrite growth on SIB anodes can be attributed to the homogeneous adsorption energy of Na atoms on different facets of a sodium crystal.",Journal of Power Sources
A thermodynamically stable quasi-liquid interface for dendrite-free sodium metal anodes,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.Dendrite-associated cell degradation is a key challenge to the practical application of sodium metal anodes. Here, we present that incorporation of a tiny amount of mercury into sodium generates a unique quasi-liquid interface that affords long-term cycling stability. This amalgam layer allows fast electron transfer and sodium migration at the electrolyte-electrode interphase, which significantly promote the cycling performance over 5000 h with a practically desired capacity of 2 mA h cm-2 and a current density of 8 mA cm-2. In situ optical microscopy analyses confirm that dendrite nucleation and growth can be remarkably suppressed with the amalgam-protected anodes. Prototype full cells also demonstrate a much improved rate and long-term cycling stability. These promising results provide new perspectives on the regulation of sodium electrodeposition by introducing low-melting metals and hence the elimination of the dendritic morphology for the practical development of sodium metal batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

Altering the Electrochemical Pathway of Sulfur Chemistry with Oxygen for High Energy Density and Low Shuttling in a Na/S Battery,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.In this work, we demonstrate that intrinsically altering the reaction pathway of a sulfur-based cathode with designed additional redox activities could simultaneously suppress polysulfide shuttling and enhance energy density. A new hybrid sulfur-oxygen chemistry was described for room-temperature Na/S batteries, where the solvated sodium-oxygen reaction in the electrolyte redirected the cathode chemistry via the formation of NaO2-Na2Sn (1< n ≤ 4) clusters at the nanoscale. These intermediate oxy-sulfur species serve as an effective mediator to immobilize the polysulfide species and unlock high specific capacity from the hybrid cathode. This new cathode chemistry delivers a high reversible capacity of over 1400 mA h/g, low overpotential (∼250 mV), and stable cycling performance (over 800 mA h/g after 50 cycles). The judicious hybridization of oxygen and sulfur chemistries has resolved the persistent degradation that has been plaguing all sulfur-based cathodes and enabled a high energy and reversible Na/S battery at room temperature.",ACS Energy Letters
An in Situ Prepared Covalent Sulfur-Carbon Composite Electrode for High-Performance Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.A covalent sulfur-carbon (covalent-SC) composite is successfully prepared in situ by a wet-chemical solvothermal method based on the strong interaction between carbon disulfide (CS2) and red phosphorus. It is demonstrated that sulfur uniformly distributes among the boundary and interior of the carbon skeleton with the formation of S-C bonds. Moreover, the interior sulfur can be electrochemically activated under 0.5 V and then functions as a capacity sponsor, because Na+ can freely transfer into the carbon interlayer (with a stable enlarged distance of ∼0.4 nm after the first cycle) via adsorption-like behavior to be combined with the interior sulfur in the following cycles. Thus, the activated covalent-SC composite delivers ultrahigh reversible capacities of 888.9 and 811.4 mAh g-1 after 600 and 950 deep cycles at 0.8C and 1.6C, respectively. Furthermore, it exhibits outstanding rate performance with the capacity of 700 mAh g-1 at a high rate of 8.1C.",ACS Energy Letters
Core-Shell Cathode Design with Molybdenum Trioxide as the Electrocatalytic Trapping Layer for High-Energy Density Room-Temperature Sodium Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries are receiving immense attention because of their low cost and higher energy density compared to lithium ion batteries. The key challenges of room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries are the polysulfide shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfide conversion. To mitigate these two issues, molybdenum trioxide is chosen to catalytically covert the sodium polysulfide as well as chemically anchor the polysulfide toward the cathode. This proof of concept is implemented and realized through the change in the design of the cathode wherein the sulfur is used as the core layer and MoO3 is used as the catalytic shell layer for shielding the polysulfide migration. The core-shell design of the cathode delivers a specific capacity of 1198 mA h g-1 at a current density of 50 mA g-1, which is about 4.2 times enhancement in specific capacity when compared to the single-layered cathode with a cycling stability of 1000 cycles. The core-shell cathode design offers a more stable open circuit potential for over 20 days and low charge transfer resistance. The enhancement in specific capacity is attributed to the formation of polythionate complexes through the reaction of MoO3 with the polysulfides which helps in strong binding of soluble species as evident from the spectroscopy studies. This is the first attempt of utilizing catalytic MoO3 for binding sodium polysulfide in room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries and will provide a new practical approach for the development.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Quasi-Solid-State Dual-Ion Sodium Metal Batteries for Low-Cost Energy Storage,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Dual-ion sodium metal||graphite batteries are a viable technology for large-scale stationary energy storage because of their high working voltages (above 4.4 V versus Na/Na+) and the low cost of electrode materials. However, traditional liquid electrolytes generally suffer from severe decomposition at such a high voltage, which results in poor cycle life.

Towards high-performance solid-state Li-S batteries: From fundamental understanding to engineering design,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries (SSLSBs) with high energy densities and high safety have been considered among the most promising energy storage devices to meet the demanding market requirements for electric vehicles. However, critical challenges such as lithium polysulfide shuttling effects, mismatched interfaces, Li dendrite growth, and the gap between fundamental research and practical applications still hinder the commercialization of SSLSBs. This review aims to combine the fundamental and engineering perspectives to seek rational design parameters for practical SSLSBs. The working principles, constituent components, and practical challenges of SSLSBs are reviewed. Recent progress and approaches to understand the interfacial challenges via advanced characterization techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are summarized and discussed. A series of design parameters including sulfur loading, electrolyte thickness, discharge capacity, discharge voltage, and cathode sulfur content are systematically analyzed to study their influence on the gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of SSLSB pouch cells.

One-Pot Fabrication of Crumpled N-Doped Graphene Anchored with Cobalt for High-Performance Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe commercialization of sulfur batteries is hindered by a few inherent drawbacks. In this study, crumpled N-doped graphene anchored with cobalt (Co-NCG) was fabricated in one pot via a sample solvothermal method and applied to lithium-sulfur (Li−S) batteries. The crumpled structure not only gives graphene a large specific surface area and abundant pores, but also endows graphene superb stability by preventing its restacking; these features are beneficial for loading and efficient utilization of sulfur. The lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom underwent strong chemical interactions with Li ions, which lent the Co-NCG/S material the ability to chemically immobilize polysulfide species. Cobalt acts as an electrocatalyst in the battery and kinetically accelerates sulfur redox reactions. As a result of these multifunctional arrangements, the Co-NCG/S cathode showed excellent capacity retention and reaction kinetics and high sulfur loading capacity.",ChemElectroChem
N-doped interconnected carbon aerogels as an efficient SeS2 host for long life Na-SeS2 batteries,"© 2020, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Selenium sulfide (SeS2) cathodes have attracted much concerns as an optimized choice comparing to sulfur and selenium for lithium and sodium storage. However, it also suffers from poor cycling stability due to the dissolution of reaction intermediate products. In this study, N-doped Interconnected carbon aerogels was applied as an efficient SeS2 host by infiltrating selenium sulfide into its microporous structure (denoted as SeS2@NCAs), which could effectively accommodate the volume change of SeS2 during cycling and alleviate the dissolution of reaction intermediate products. Therefore, as for Na storage, the SeS2@NCAs cathode delivers a superior long-term cycling performance of 536 mA·h·g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A·g−1 after 1,000 cycles with only 0.04% capacity decline per cycle and a high rate performance (524 mA·h·g−1 at 2 A·g−1 and 745 mA·h·g−1 at 0.1 A·g−1 retained), indicating the remarkable cycling stability of SeS2@NCAs cathodes.

Design of a composite cathode and a graphene coated separator for a stable room-temperature aluminum-sulfur battery,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Both aluminum and sulfur are promising materials for future-generation electrochemical energy storage technology owing to their natural abundance, low cost, and high capacity. However, a rechargeable aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) battery with high energy density suffers from poor reversibility and very short cycle life. Herein, a graphene/CoS2/sulfur composite cathode together with a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coated separator are fabricated to improve the room-temperature Al-S battery performance. The rGO coating on the separator along with the composite cathode form a sandwich structure which effectively suppresses the diffusion of polysulfides and decreases the polarization of the battery. As a result, the Al-S battery gives a stable cycle life of 38 cycles with a high discharge capacity range of 676-1145 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1; the performance is greatly improved compared with the bare separator. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic analyses illustrate the mechanism of electrochemical reactions in detail. These meaningful studies facilitate a remarkable step forward in the progress of Al-S batteries.",Sustainable Energy and Fuels
Single-Atom Catalytic Materials for Advanced Battery Systems,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAdvanced battery systems with high energy density have attracted enormous research enthusiasm with potential for portable electronics, electrical vehicles, and grid-scale systems. To enhance the performance of conversion-type batteries, various catalytic materials are developed, including metals and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Metals are highly conductive with catalytic effects, but bulk structures with low surface area result in low atom utilization, and high chemical reactivity induces unfavorable dendrite effects. TMDs present chemical adsorption with active species and catalytic activity promotes conversion processes, suppressing shuttle effect and improving energy density. But they suffer from inferior conductivity compared with metal, and limited sites mainly concentrate on edges and defects. Single-atom materials with atomic sizes, good conductivity, and individual sites are promising candidates for advanced batteries because of a large atom utilization, unsaturated coordination, and unique electronic structure. Single-atom sites with high activity chemically trap intermediates to suppress shuttle effects and facilitate electron transfer and redox reactions for achieving high capacity, rate capability, and conversion efficiency. Herein, single-atom catalytic electrodes design for advanced battery systems is addressed. Major challenges and promising strategies concerning electrochemical reactions, theoretical model, and in situ characterization are discussed to shed light on future research of single-atom material-based energy systems.",Advanced Materials
Enhanced electrochemical performance of all-solid-state sodium-sulfur batteries by PEO-NaCF3SO3-MIL-53(Al) solid electrolyte,"© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.A flexible PEO-NaCF3SO3-MIL-53(Al) solid electrolyte is fabricated for all-solid-state sodium-sulfur batteries (ASSBs). When the mole ratio of EO (ethylene oxide of PEO):Na (sodium ion of NaCF3SO3) is 20 and MIL-53(Al) is 3.24 wt%, high ionic conductivities of 6.87 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 60 °C and 6.52 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 100 °C are achieved. And the sodium ion transference number is significantly increased to 0.40 from 0.13 compared to the PEO-NaCF3SO3 solid electrolyte without MIL-53(Al). When it is assembled to ASSBs, the batteries obtain high capacity retention and reversible current-rate capability. At 0.1 C and 60 °C, the solid-state battery delivers the first discharge capacity of 897.7 mAh g−1 and 674.9 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles with a coulombic efficiency near 100%. The enhanced electrochemical performances of the solid electrolyte, as well as ASSBs, are benefited from MIL-53(Al) filler.",Ionics
Design strategies for nonaqueous multivalent-ion and monovalent-ion battery anodes,"© 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.The inability of current battery technologies to keep up with the performance requirements of industry is pushing forward developments in electrochemistry. Specifically, the battery’s negative electrode, the anode, presents many unique chemical, physical and engineering challenges. Lithium-based battery technologies have dominated the past decade, but concerns about the limited supply of lithium in the Earth’s crust have led researchers to look towards alternative metal-ion technologies. Various alkali metals (such as sodium and potassium) and alkali earth metals (such as magnesium and calcium) have attracted significant research interest. In this Review, we analyse these technologies in a coherent manner, addressing the problems of each type of anode, rather than those of specific types of metal-ion batteries. Covering direct metal plating and stripping, intercalation-based, alloy-based and conversion-reaction-based anode technologies, this analysis will offer the reader a comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of different metal-ion anodes and of what can be learned by transferring knowledge between these different systems.",Nature Reviews Materials
Boosting the stable sodium-ion storage performance by tailoring the 1D TiO2@ReS2 core-shell heterostructures,"© 2020ReS2 has been considered as an emerging transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its electrochemical performance is severely limited by the structural aggregation and damage during deep charge-discharge. Here, a new 1D TiO2@ReS2 core-shell structure is reported for boosting the stable performance as the TiO2 has durable structural stability. The 1D TiO2 nanotubes with rough surface and large surface area are helpful to grow few-layer (≤4 layers) ReS2 nanosheets onto their surface. In the obtained 1D TiO2 nanotube@ReS2 nanosheet (1D TiO2-NT@ReS2-NS) core-shell heterostructures, the exposed ultrathin ReS2 nanosheets offer high contact area for rapid Na+ diffusion, whilst the TiO2 nanotubes work as robust backbone for accommodating volume change and strain. Moreover, the chemical interfacial interaction between TiO2 and ReS2 gives rise to favorable synergistic effect, leading to enhanced electrical conductivity, Na+ diffusion kinetics, and structural stability at both electrode and materials levels. These findings can be supported by various characterization technologies such as X-ray photoelectron spectrum and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. As a result, the 1D TiO2-NT@ReS2-NS electrode displays a desirable long-life span cycling performance of 118 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles in sodium-ion batteries. This work not only reports a stable SIBs anode material, but also provides fundamental understanding for designing and fabricating electrode materials for alkali metal ion batteries.",Electrochimica Acta
Tailoring conductive networks within hollow carbon nanospheres to host phosphorus for advanced sodium ion batteries,"© 2020The formidable sustainability challenges in advancing energy storage technologies call for game-changing research in battery designs. The previous pursuing of novel cathode materials with high redox potentials impedes the vast applications due to the simultaneous electrolyte decomposition at high potentials, though they are expected to deliver high specific capacities. Eventually, people start thinking in an opposite way, desirable anode materials with low redox potentials can also own high specific capacities. Among all the promising candidates, phosphorus-based anodes in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have received considerable attention owing to the low cost and relatively high natural abundance of phosphorus. More importantly, phosphorus can store three sodium atoms and enable a high theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh g−1, which overwhelms any other SIB anode currently available. However, the poor electronic conductivity and large volume change of phosphorus during cycling severely deteriorate battery performance. The most widely used strategy is to confine phosphorus within well-designed carbon hosts. We thereby introduce a new type of porous hollow carbon with conductive-network interior as phosphorus host, which not only improves the electrical conductivity, but also creates enough interior surface for maximizing phosphorus utilization and shortening the ion's diffusion distance, compared to those conventional hollow carbon hosts. Therefore, the as-prepared red phosphorus-carbon spheres composites (RP/CS) exhibit superior rate performance (~1083 mAh g−1 at 4 A g−1, ~837 mAh g−1 even at 8 A g−1) and excellent cycle life (1027 mAh g−1 at 4 A g−1 more than 2000 cycles).",Nano Energy
Confined growth of porous nitrogen-doped cobalt oxide nanoarrays as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for rechargeable zinc–air batteries,"© 2019Cobalt oxides are promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts due to their intrinsic activities toward both dissociation and formation of oxygen molecules. Unfortunately, their practical utilization is seriously hindered by the limited accessible active sites and inferior activity. Herein, vertically-aligned porous nanoarrays composed of ultrafine nitrogen-doped cobalt oxide (NP-Co3O4) nanoparticles (4-5 ​nm) are in-situ fabricated on carbon cloth (CC) via mild oxidation of Co-based zeolitic-imidazolate-framework (Co-ZIF) nanoarrays. The oxidation decomposition of 2-methylimidazolate ligands between Co nodes not only confines the growth of cobalt oxides, but also provides the nitrogen sources for realizing low-temperature (200 ​°C) nitrogen doping. In alkaline electrolyte, the as-built NP-Co3O4/CC manifests an extremely high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) half-wave potential of ~0.9 ​V and a decreased oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 330 ​mV ​at 10 ​mA ​cm−2, displaying a record low potential gap of 0.66 ​V. As bifunctional oxygen electrodes in rechargeable aqueous and all-solid-state flexible zinc-air batteries, the NP-Co3O4/CC-based batteries exhibit ultrahigh power densities up to 200 ​mW ​cm−2 and 99.8 ​mW ​cm−3, respectively, which are much higher than those of reported bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. This work paves a new avenue for the fabrication of porous nitrogen doped metal oxides towards high-performance zinc-air batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Restructured rimous copper foam as robust lithium host,"© 2020Uncontrollable growth of lithium (Li) dendrites and infinite volume change during cycling limit the practical implementation of Li metal anode in batteries. Three-dimensional (3D) porous materials with interconnected conductive skeleton are expected as ideal hosts to boost uniform Li deposition by reducing the local current density and Li nucleation barrier. However, surface modifications for the 3D conductive frameworks are complicated and costly, and most of these host materials can only afford shallow cycling at smaller current densities. Herein, a new strategy is proposed to fabricate rimous Cu foam (RCF) with ant-nest-like porous skeleton via a novel polysulfide-assisted reconstruction approach. The interconnected conducting Cu network with a larger and lithiophilic surface enables uniform and deep Li deposition into the interior space of RCF. The unique ant-nest-like interior channel not only endows a high intake capacity for Li, but also abstains volume fluctuation of Li anode during cycling. Therefore, the RCF-modified Li anode delivers excellent cycling stability with high Coulombic efficiency of 99% after 660 cycles at 1 ​mA ​cm−2 and small overpotential of 30 ​mV over 200 ​h under a high plating/stripping rate of 3 ​mA ​cm−2. More importantly, full cells paired with practical-level LiFePO4 cathode exhibit exceptional performance under high current densities.",Energy Storage Materials

Here, we design a free-standing film, constructed from Co nanoparticles onto nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanofibers (Co@NPCNFs), to load sulfur for RT Na-S batteries. Experiment result shows that Co as catalyst can enable the rapid sodium intercalation and fast reduction reaction of the polysulfides during cycling. Hence, the prepared Co@NPCNFs/S cathode exhibits a remarkable capacity of 906 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and long cycling life up to 800 cycles with a slow capacity decay of 0.038% per cycle at 1 C.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

The development of reliable and flexible electrodes with low cost, high performance, superior stability and safety remains a great challenge to meet the requirements for many practical applications. On the other hand, structural design can also enhance their flexibility and electrochemical performance. On account of the low cost and easily accessible sodium resources, in the present review we mainly focus on recent progress in flexible energy storage devices with sodium-ions as the charge carriers. We begin with a brief introduction of flexible energy storage systems and the current development of flexible sodium-ion based energy storage devices. Then, a more detailed overview of recent progress on pliable materials in flexible sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is presented, including carbon-based substrates materials (e.g., graphene, carbon cloths, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)), metal-based materials (e.g., stainless steel, copper (Cu) and titanium (Ti) foils), other flexible substrate materials and electrolytes. This is followed by detailed discussion of the advancements in other flexible analogous sodium-based energy systems, such as the fiber-shaped flexible SIBs, sodium-ion capacitors (SICs), Na–S batteries and Na–Se batteries. Finally, future prospects and challenges are examined and possible solutions are brought up to inspire the future flexible sodium-based energy storage devices.",Energy Storage Materials

Herein, thermodynamic calculations are performed to obtain: 1) theoretical energy densities (based on the cathode and anode active materials) of 1683 kinds of batteries of conversion reaction chemistry using Li, Na, K, Mg, Al, and Zn as the anodes; and 2) electromotive force (EMF, also known as thermodynamic equilibrium voltage) of these batteries. Among these batteries, theoretical energy density above 1000 ​Wh kg−1, 800 ​Wh L−1 and EMF over 1.50 ​V are taken as the screening criteria to reveal significant battery systems. In addition, hazard and cost issues are examined. Ultimately, there are 51 kinds of batteries satisfying the screening criteria, including O2/Li, O2/Al, O2/Mg, H2O/Li, CO2/Li, S/Li, CO2/Al, H2O/Al batteries. Moreover, practical energy densities of the cells are estimated using a solid-state pouch cell with electrolyte of PEO/LiTFSI. Knowing the batteries with high energy densities will guide the research and development on the next-generation energy storage.",Energy Storage Materials
"Metal-organic frameworks derived porous carbon, metal oxides and metal sulfides-based compounds for supercapacitors application","© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The energy storage field has witnessed a dramatic expansion in terms of short charging time of supercapacitors, especially in the highly active electrode materials. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials have been extensively applied as precursors or templates for the synthesis of carbon, metal oxides/sulfides-based compounds as high-performance electrodes in supercapacitors. The MOFs-derived materials can be broadly divided into two groups: MOFs-derived porous carbon and MOFs-derived metal oxide/sulfide compounds. These MOFs-derived materials are characterized by unique porous structures, controllable structures, high surface area, good conductivity (MOFs-derived carbon) and outstanding electrochemical stability, meeting the requirements of the desirable specific capacitance and long-term cyclic performance of both electrochemical double layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors. However, MOFs-derived materials still suffer from the complex synthesis process and high production cost of MOFs precursors, difficulties in mass production, and unstable structure in highly corrosive electrolyte. In addition, the electrical conductivity of MOFs-derived metal oxides/sulfides needs to be further improved. In this review, we summarize the recent progresses in the development of MOFs-derived porous carbons and metal oxide/sulfide compounds and their applications in supercapacitors. The prospects and challenges of MOFs-derived carbon and metal oxide/sulfide compounds as highly effective and durable electrodes in supercapacitors are discussed.",Energy Storage Materials
Emerging applications of atomic layer deposition for lithium-sulfur and sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li–S) and sodium-sulfur (Na–S) batteries are the promising energy storage systems of next-generation because of their high theoretical specific energy, abundant storage of sulfur, and long cycle life. However, both of them are suffering the low conductivity, volume expansion of cathode, corrosion of Li/Na anode by the electrolyte, shuttle effect of polysulfides, and dendrites formation of Li/Na metal anode. The new technology of atomic layer deposition (ALD) has shown great potential in Li-ion and Na-ion batteries due to the outstanding conformal deposition, digitized and accurate film thickness, and the mild low-temperature growth on complex substrates, such as mesoporous materials. Inspired by these benefits, recently, more and more studies successfully employed ALD strategy to fabricate or modify cathodes, anodes, interlayers, and all-solid-state electrolytes with precisely atomic level conformal films to improve their conductivity, stability, and mechanical properties for the high electrochemical performance of Li–S and Na–S batteries. To our knowledge, this is the first review to systematically summarize the most recent advances of ALD for both Li–S and Na–S batteries applications. Especially, various functions of the ALD technique in Li–S and Na–S batteries have been presented and fully discussed with classical examples. Further, the mechanism, advantages, and future development of ALD are also proposed and discussed.",Energy Storage Materials
A flexible and free-standing FeS/sulfurized polyacrylonitrile hybrid anode material for high-rate sodium-ion storage,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Sodium-ion based energy storage systems have attracted extensive attention due to the similarities in the mechanism of operation with lithium-ion batteries along with the additional benefit of low cost and high abundance of sodium resources. Iron sulfide-based electrodes that operate via conversion mechanism have shown ample potential for high energy sodium-ion storage. However, the problems related with tremendous volume changes and the dissolution of sodium polysulfides in the electrolyte deteriorate the cycle life and limit their application in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a hybrid anode material, FeS/SPAN-HNF, with iron sulfide (FeS) nanoparticles decorated in a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) fiber matrix is demonstrated as flexible and free-standing anode material for high-rate SIBs. Unlike previous strategies in which FeS is encapsulated in an electrochemically inactive carbon matrix, this study utilizes SPAN, an electrochemically active material, as a dual functional matrix that can efficiently buffer volume expansion and sulfur dissolution of FeS nanoparticles as well as provide significant capacity improvement. The as-designed electrode is self-standing and flexible, without current collectors, binders or additional conductive agents, thus rendering enhanced practical capacity and energy density. This electrode showed a high reversible capacity of 782.8 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1 with excellent high rate capability, maintaining 327.5 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 5 A g−1, emphasizing promising prospects for the development of flexible and high energy density SIBs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
A Functionalized Carbon Surface for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Storage,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising for large-scale energy storage systems and carbon materials are the most likely candidates for their electrodes. The existence of defects in carbon materials is crucial for increasing the sodium storage ability. However, both the reversible capacity and efficiency need to be further improved. Functionalization is a direct and feasible approach to address this issue. Based on the structural changes in carbon materials produced by surface functionalization, three basic categories are defined: heteroatom doping, grafting of functional groups, and the shielding of defects. Heteroatom doping can improve the electrochemical reactivity, and the grafting of functional groups can promote both the diffusion-controlled bulk process and surface-confined capacitive process. The shielding of defects can further increase the efficiency and cyclic stability without sacrificing reversible capacity. In this Review, recent progresses in the ways to produce surface functionalization are presented and the related impact on the physical and chemical properties of carbon materials is discussed. Moreover, the critical issues, challenges, and possibilities for future research are summarized.",Small
Transient modeling and simulation of a nonisothermal sodium–sulfur cell,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.The use of sodium-sulfur batteries at the grid level requires high current density operation that can cause cell deterioration, leading to lower sulfur utilization and lower energy efficiency. In addition, it can result in undesired thermal runaway leading to potentially hazardous situations. A rigorous, dynamic model of a sodium-sulfur battery can be used to study these phenomena, design the battery for optimal transient performance, and develop mitigation strategies. With this motivation, a first-principles, fully coupled thermal-electrochemical dynamic model of the entire sodium-sulfur cell has been developed. The thermal model considers heat generation due to Ohmic loss, Peltier heat, and heat due to entropy change. Species conservation equations are written in the sulfur electrode by considering the phase transition and change in the composition depending on the SOD. Species conservation equations are written in the beta”-alumina electrolyte for the ionic species by considering the change in composition due to diffusion and migration. In addition, the potential distribution, and cell resistance for this spatially distributed system has been modeled. Furthermore, temperature-dependent correlations for the physicochemical properties are developed. The model is used to study both charging and discharging characteristics of the cell at varying current densities.",Journal of Power Sources
High-performance sodium–selenium batteries enabled by microporous carbon/selenium cathode and fluoroethylene carbonate electrolyte additive,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Sodium-selenium (Na–Se) batteries are promising energy storage systems due to their relatively low cost and high volumetric energy density of Se cathode. However, the practical application of Na–Se batteries has been hindered by the polyselenides dissolution (or shuttle effect phenomena), which could cause low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycling lifetime. Herein, we addressed the polyselenides dissolution by using microporous carbon (MPC) derived from poly (vinylidene fluoride) as the Se host and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the additive in the electrolyte. The MPC/Se cathode with 3% FEC additive maintained a specific capacity of 382 and 350 mAh g−1 in the 100th and 200th cycle, respectively, while the MPC/Se cathode without FEC could only deliver 317 and 245 mAh g−1 after 100 and 200 cycles, respectively. Another important finding was that the use of FEC additive could prevent the corrosion of Na metal anode from soluble polyselenides, and preserve the structural integrity of Na anode, contributing to the enhanced cycling stability and specific capacity of Na–Se batteries. It is expected that this work could draw researchers’ attention to the importance of reporting and studying Na metal anode while optimizing Se cathode for Na–Se batteries.",Journal of Power Sources

The thickness of the carbon shell was 4 nm, and the diameter of the NiS2 core was 28 nm. The electrochemical performance of NiS2@C electrode was measured as the cathode materials for Na-S batteries. The Coulombic efficiency of NiS2@C electrode remained above 90% after four cycles at a current density of 100 mA•g-1, and the reversible specific capacity of 106.8 mAh•g-1 remained after 500 cycles, which showed high cyclic stability. The electrochemical impedance analysis reveals that the electrode reactions were accelerated and the dynamic equilibrium of ion migration at the interface was maintained due to its good electronic conductivity and excellent structural stability by the constraint of the external carbon layer.",Cailiao Yanjiu Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Materials Research
Strongly coupled sulfur nanoparticles on graphene-carbon nanotube hybrid electrode for multifunctional sodium and aluminium ion storage,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The practical utility of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in sodium and aluminium ion batteries are limited due to its low interlayer spacing of 0.34 nm. Herein, we have developed a simple approach of enhancing the interlayer spacing of multiwalled carbon nanotubes by incorporating sulfur nanoparticles into graphene-multiwalled carbon nanotube (GCNT) structure. This proof of concept is realised from its excellent specific capacity and cyclic stability for the first time in sodium and aluminium ion batteries. GCNT/S as the anode in sodium ion battery exhibits a specific capacity of about 510 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 with a cyclic stability of 2500 cycles which results in about 42% enhancement in specific capacity when compared to GCNT. GCNT/S as cathode in aluminium ion battery shows a specific capacity of 507 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 and a stable cyclic stability for 600 cycles. This is about 7.2 times enhancement in specific capacity when compared to GCNT. The highly durable nature is due to the small sulfur particles which offer low volume expansion and the GCNT structure acts as a buffer matrix for controlling the volume expansion. Our study provides a new and a simple strategy to enhance the specific capacity and cyclic stability of multiwalled carbon nanotubes for sodium ion batteries and aluminium ion batteries which can be a promising approach for other cost-effective battery technologies as well.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Boosting Sodium Storage in Two-Dimensional Phosphorene/Ti3C2Tx MXene Nanoarchitectures with Stable Fluorinated Interphase,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.The stacking of complementary two-dimensional (2D) materials into hybrid architectures is desirable for batteries with enhanced capacity, fast charging, and long lifetime. However, the 2D heterostructures for energy storage are still underdeveloped, and some associated problems like low Coulombic efficiencies need to be tackled. Herein, we reported a phosphorene/MXene hybrid anode with an in situ formed fluorinated interphase for stable and fast sodium storage. The combination of phosphorene nanosheets with Ti3C2Tx MXene not only facilitates the migration of both electrons and sodium cations but also alleviates structural expansion of phosphorene and thereby improves the cycling performance of the hybrid anode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in-depth analysis reveals that the fluorine terminated MXene stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase by forming fluorine-rich compounds on the anode surface. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the sodium affinities and diffusion kinetics are significantly enhanced in the phosphorene/MXene heterostructure, particularly in the phosphorene/Ti3C2F2. As a result, the hybrid electrode achieved a high reversible capacity of 535 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and superior cycling performance (343 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1 with a capacity retention of 87%) in a fluorine-free carbonate electrolyte.",ACS Nano
Li10Ge(P1-xSb x)2S12 Lithium-Ion Conductors with Enhanced Atmospheric Stability,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Sulfide solid electrolytes have recently attracted significant interest for use in all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) due to their high ionic conductivity. However, one of the main challenges associated with the commercialization of sulfide-based electrolytes is their instability toward air/moisture, which leads to complex processing requirements. Herein, we develop a strategy to not only increase ionic conductivity but also obtain high air stability of the Li10Ge(P1-xSbx)2S12 electrolyte system with soft acid Sb substitution. Theoretical calculations predict the Sb substitution in (Ge,P)S4 tetrahedral sites, which is further confirmed by the X-ray diffraction Rietveld refinement and synchrotron X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. Opened channels and increased unit cell volume are achieved with an appropriate amount of Sb substitution, leading to an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 17.3 ± 0.9 mS cm-1. The softer acidity of Sb compared to that of P also ensures strong covalent bonding with S in Li10Ge(P1-xSbx)2S12, which improves the air stability of the electrolyte. Moreover, the air-exposed samples exhibit high ionic conductivities of 12.1-15.7 mS cm-1. Bulk-type ASSLBs assembled with either pristine or air-exposed Li10Ge(P1-xSbx)2S12 exhibit high initial Coulombic efficiencies of 92.8 and 91.0%, respectively, with excellent cycling performances of over 110 cycles. The observed variations in the structural parameters and bond strengths provide an effective approach toward designing more ionically conductive and stable solid-state electrolytes.",Chemistry of Materials
In Situ Sulfurized Carbon-Confined Cobalt for Long-Life Mg/S Batteries,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Magnesium (Mg) batteries have attracted growing attention because of their low cost and high volumetric capacity. Mg/S batteries are of particular interest because of the high capacities of Mg and sulfur, which cooperatively enable high energy densities. However, the shuttling polysulfides during the S0/S2- conversion impair the cathode stability and corrode the Mg anode. This work reports the in situ sulfurization of carbon-confined cobalt in a mesoporous matrix (MesoCo@C) through sulfur melt impregnation and its effectiveness in uplifting the cathode stability and alleviating the Mg anode corrosion (i.e., formation of magnesium sulfides/sulfates). The CoSx species play important roles in binding with polysulfides and regulating the notorious polysulfide shuttle. Both the carbon matrix and the preserved cobalt are excellent electron conductors and allow fast charge transfer to the CoSx species, which become the active sites that facilitate the interaction with magnesium polysulfides and improve the cathode kinetics.

Lithiophilic V2O5 nanobelt arrays decorated 3D framework hosts for highly stable composite lithium metal anodes,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The lithium metal anode has been considered to be an optimal anode material for high-energy-density battery system due to its ultrahigh specific capacity. However, the sharp dendrite growth and infinite volume expansion have significantly impeded its commercial application. Herein, we propose that V2O5 as the lithiophilic substance can be decorated onto 3D stable frameworks to fabricate dendrite-suppressed composite Li metal anodes via a molten Li infusion method. It is demonstrated that the energetic chemical reaction between V2O5 and molten Li together with the capillary effect based on the nanostructure of interconnected V2O5 nanobelt arrays contributes synergistically to the great Li affinity of the V2O5-Ni foam (V2O5-NF) host and facilitate the efficient and uniform intake of molten Li into the 3D framework. Benefitting from the homogeneous Li distribution in the framework, the decreased local current density of the electrode and the stable property of the host, dendrite-free Li stripping/plating behavior and alleviated volume fluctuation have been achieved for the Li-V2O5-NF composite anode. Compared with the bare Li anode, the as-obtained Li-V2O5-NF composite anode exhibits much stable stripping/plating profiles with low overpotential (~18 mV) for ultralong lifespan (1600 h) at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 in symmetric Li/Li cell. Furthermore, outstanding rate capability and long-term cycling performance (78.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles under 2 C) are obtained in full cells when coupled with Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) cathodes, indicating a promising potential for practical application. Moreover, this work demonstrates that using a new lithiophilic material, V2O5, should be an effective method to construct high stable 3D Li metal anode for Li metal battery.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Co3O4 nanosheet decorated nickel foams as advanced lithium host skeletons for dendrite-free lithium metal anode,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have been regarded as the most promising battery system for the next-generation high energy density batteries due to the extremely high specific capacity of the lithium (Li) metal anode. Unfortunately, the commercial application has been hindered by sharp dendrite Li growth and infinite relative volume change during the repeated charge/discharge process, which lead to severe safety issues and poor cyclability of the battery. Herein, a novel composite Lithium anode is fabricated via thermally infusion molten Li into three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (NF) framework decorated by lithiophilic Co3O4 nanosheet arrays. The universalized growth of Co3O4 nanosheet on the Ni foam can provide superior wettability between the molten Li and Ni foam, and facilitate more convenient infusion process (5 s). Benefitting from uniform distribution of Li in the 3D host and homogeneous Li+ flux on the surface of the electrode, excellent Li stripping/plating performance (1000 h at 3 mA cm−2 and 275 h at 5 mA cm−2) and dendrite-suppressed morphology are achieved for the Li–Co3O4/NF composite anode. When utilized in full cells paired with a LiFePO4 cathode, the Li–Co3O4/NF composite anode demonstrates greater cyclability and rate performance than bare Li anode. As a result, the obtained Co3O4/NF demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance as a lithium host skeleton for advanced Li metal battery.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

High-performance double-network ionogels enabled by electrostatic interaction,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Production of highly conductive and mechanically robust ionogels is urgently needed for the development of diverse flexible electrical devices, but it remains challenging. Herein, we report a facile strategy to prepare high-performance ionogels (ionic conductivity of 1.9 S m-1, fracture strain of 170%) via electrostatic interaction between mechanically robust charged gel double networks and conductive ionic liquids. Ionogels based on charged polymer networks (with electrostatic interaction) exhibit obvious higher optical transmittance, ionic conductivity, and better mechanical properties compared with those based on neutral polymer networks (without electrostatic interaction). Ionic conductivity and mechanical properties of the ionogels can also be regulated by the double-network structure of the gels. We further develop an ionic skin sensor with the high-performance ionogels used as ionic conductors, which can exhibit excellent sensing performance even under harsh conditions. We envision that this new class of high-performance ionogels would be an attractive alternative to traditional hydrogels, and would extend the applications of ionic conductors to extreme environments.",RSC Advances

Electron-State Confinement of Polysulfides for Highly Stable Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimConfinement of polysulfides in sulfur cathodes is pivotal for eliminating the “shuttle effect” in metal–sulfur batteries, which represent promising solutions for large-scale and sustainable energy storage. However, mechanistic exploration and in-depth understanding for the confinement of polysulfides remain limited. Consequently, it is a critical challenge to achieve highly stable metal–sulfur batteries. Here, based on a 2D metal–organic framework (2D MOF), a new mechanism to realize effective confinement of polysulfides is proposed. A combination of in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical computations reveal that the dynamic electron states of the Ni centers in the 2D MOF enable the interaction between polysulfides and the MOF in the discharge/charge process to be tuned, resulting in both strong adsorption and fast conversion kinetics of polysulfides. The resultant room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries are amongst the most stable reported so far, thus demonstrating that the new mechanism opens a promising avenue for the development of high-performance metal–sulfur batteries.",Advanced Materials

Achieving superior high-capacity batteries with the lightest Ti2C MXene anode by first-principles calculations: Overarching role of S-functionate (Ti 2CS2) and multivalent cations carrier,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Finding thin, light and high-capacity electrode materials is an urgent need for the application of rechargeable metal-ion batteries. The performance of MXenes as anode materials are largely determined by the surface terminal groups, and surface modification strategies are often used to improve their energy storage performance. Here S-functionalized Ti2C is designed and the properties of it as anode materials for rechargeable metal-ion batteries is studied by first-principles calculations, including Li-, Na-, K-, Mg-, Ca-, and Al-ion batteries. The metallic nature, high structural stability of Ti2CS2 monolayer, as well as the small diffusion barriers and low OCV values of these metal cations make the Ti2CS2 monolayer a promising anode material for rechargeable metal-ion batteries. Most importantly, the stable multilayer adsorption (up to three layers) of Na and Mg ensure the excellent capacity of Ti2CS2 monolayer in Na-ion (935.57 mA h g−1) and Mg-ion (1871.13 mA h g−1) batteries. The findings in our work may encourage further experimental and theoretical research on the designation of MXenes-based, even other two-dimensional anode materials for high-capacity rechargeable metal-ion batteries.",Journal of Power Sources
Can Hybrid Na–Air Batteries Outperform Nonaqueous Na–O2 Batteries?,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimIn recent years, there has been an upsurge in the study of novel and alternative energy storage devices beyond lithium-based systems due to the exponential increase in price of lithium. Sodium (Na) metal-based batteries can be a possible alternative to lithium-based batteries due to the similar electrochemical voltage of Na and Li together with the thousand times higher natural abundance of Na compared to Li. Though two different kinds of Na–O2 batteries have been studied specifically based on electrolytes until now, very recently, a hybrid Na–air cell has shown distinctive advantage over nonaqueous cell systems. Hybrid Na–air batteries provide a fundamental advantage due to the formation of highly soluble discharge product (sodium hydroxide) which leads to low overpotentials for charge and discharge processes, high electrical energy efficiency, and good cyclic stability. Herein, the current status and challenges associated with hybrid Na–air batteries are reported. Also, a brief description of nonaqueous Na–O2 batteries and its close competition with hybrid Na–air batteries are provided.",Advanced Science
Associating and Tuning Sodium and Oxygen Mixed-Ion Conduction in Niobium-Based Perovskites,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimPure ionic conductors as solid-state electrolytes are of high interest in electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices. They systematically involve only one ion as the charge carrier. The association of two mobile ionic species, one positively and the other negatively charged, in a specific network should strongly influence the total ion conduction. Nb5+- (4d0) and Ti4+-based (3d0) derived-perovskite frameworks containing Na+ and O2− as mobile species are investigated as mixed ion conductors by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The design of Na+ blocking layers via sandwiched pellet sintered by spark plasma sintering at high temperatures leads to quantified transport number of both ionic charge carriers tNa+ and tO2−. In the 350–700 °C temperature range, ionic conductivity can be tuned from major Na+ contribution (tNa+ = 88%) for NaNbO3 to pure O2− transport in NaNb0.9Ti0.1O2.95 phase. Such a Ti-substitution is accompanied with a ≈100-fold increase in the oxygen conductivity, approaching the best values for pure oxygen conductors in this temperature range. Besides the demonstration of tunable mixed ion conduction with quantifiable cationic and anionic contributions in a single solid-state structure, a strategy is established from structural analysis to develop other architectures with improved mixed ionic conductivity.",Advanced Functional Materials

Long-Life Sodium Metal Anodes Achieved by Cuprous Oxide–Modified Ni Foam Host,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium metal is considered as a potential anode material for future energy-storage systems. However, the practical application of Na is hindered by the infinite dimension change and dendrite growth during Na stripping/plating. Herein, a nanoflowered cuprous oxide–modified nickel foam (CNF) matrix is used as a stable host to guide Na nucleation behavior and suppress dendrite growth. Tailored CNF shows a 3D porous core–shell cylindrical structure with Cu2O as the shell and special Ni as the core. The shell of CuO2 can reduce the nucleation barrier of Na by reacting with sodium. The core of Ni provides a strong skeleton with high electrical conductivity, good mechanical ductility, and a rich porous structure. The unique matrix structure can direct the homogeneous nucleation of sodium metal and restrict its deposition within matrix pores, suppressing the volume expansion and dendrite growth of sodium metal. As a consequence, the Na/CNF anode exhibits an excellent stability over 1000 cycles with a capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2. Moreover, the full battery exhibits excellent performance over 300 cycles at a high rate (5 C).

A Sodium Polysulfide Battery with Liquid/Solid Electrolyte: Improving Sulfur Utilization Using P2S5 as Additive and Tetramethylurea as Catholyte Solvent,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimHerein, the proof of concept of a sodium polysulfide battery consisting of two electrode chambers being separated by a solid electrolyte is described. The concept is suited for dissolved polysulfide cathodes and has the advantage that both half reactions can be optimized separately. The formation of solid sulfide discharge products is identified as the major limiting factor for cell cycling. This issue can be alleviated by adding solid P2S5. Further improvement can be achieved by replacing diglyme (2G) as the cathode compartment solvent with tetramethylurea (TMU). Using TMU, the cell cycles with Coulombic efficiencies >99% and capacities of 800 mAh g−1 are maintained for at least 30 cycles. Viscosity, density, conductivity, and the electrochemical stability window values of the 2G- and TMU-based electrolytes are compared. The latter shows higher viscosity (2.806 vs 1.603 mPa s), higher density (1.016 vs 0.996 g cc−1), and higher conductivity (4.27 vs 1.45 mS cm−1). The oxidative stability limit of the TMU electrolyte is 3.2 V versus Na+/Na, which is sufficient for polysulfide redox reactions. Vis spectroscopy is used to follow the electrode reaction. In case of TMU, the reaction is based on the redox activity of S3 −• radicals (blue coloration of the catholyte solution).",Energy Technology
Enabling high-performance sodium metal anodes via A sodiophilic structure constructed by hierarchical Sb2MoO6 microspheres,"© 2020Sodium (Na) metal batteries have gained extensive attention as promising next-generation rechargeable batteries owing to the low cost of Na resource, high specific capacity and low electrochemical potential of Na metal anode. However, the development of Na metal batteries is still hindered by the challenge of repetitive breakage/recovery of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film caused by the volume expansion of Na metal anode during stripping/plating process, which results in dendritic Na growth, low Coulombic efficiency, and short cycling life. Herein, we synthesized hierarchical Sb2MoO6 (SMO) microspheres to serve as a substrate that can self-construct into a unique sodiophilic structure composed of ‘seed-embedded conductive buffer matrix’ to enable uniform Na deposition without dendrite growth. As a result, symmetric cells with Na-predeposited SMO (Na/SMO) electrodes demonstrate highly stable voltage profile with small hysteresis, excellent cycling stability (up to 500 cycles) at a high current density (up to 10 mA cm−2) and a large areal capacity (up to 8 mAh cm−2). Na-ion full cells consist of Na/SMO anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode show significantly enhanced electrochemical performance (a capacity of 101.3 mAh g−1 is retained after 800 cycles at 10C) compared to the cells with bare Na metal anode.",Nano Energy

Nickel manganese hydroxides with thin-layer nanosheets and multivalences for high-performance supercapacitor,"© 2019We propose a simple and effective one-step hydrothermal strategy to prepare various nickel manganese layered double hydroxides (NiMn-LDHs) by changing the concentrations of NiCl2·6H2O and MnCl2·4H2O under a fixed molar ratio of Ni to Mn of 3:1. The SEM and TEM results indicate that the obtained NiMn-LDHs are composed of thin-layer nanosheets with well-improved dispersity. Furthermore, the NiMn-LDHs displayed by the XPS analysis contain multivalent Ni and Mn ions, in which the relative contents of Ni2+ and Mn3+ are increasing with the decrease of reactant concentration. When the concentration reduce to 0.0125 mol L−1, the optimal Ni1Mn1-LDH exhibits both the thin-layer nanosheets structure with average thickness of about 15 nm and the highest contents of Ni2+ and Mn3+. Applied as an electrode material for supercapacitors, the Ni1Mn1-LDH can deliver an excellent electrochemical performance with a maximum specific capacity of 624 C g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and above 80% capacitance retention over 1000 cycles. The electrochemical performance of Ni1Mn1-LDH is further investigated by assembling two-electrode asymmetric supercapacitor with carbon spheres. The specific capacity is 106 C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and the capacitance retention is 75% over 1000 cycles. This work offers a facile way to tune simultaneously the nanostructure and multivalence of the NiMn-LDHs, and also provides a confirmation about the important affection of them on the enhanced capacitive performance for supercapacitor electrode.",Results in Physics

Considering these issues, FeS2/nitrogen-doped graphene composite (FeS2/N-G) has been proposed, where in-situ growth of FeS2 microspheres among N-doped graphene are confined into a diameter of 1–3 μm and coated with the intact and uniform N-doped graphene decoration. Through the kinetic analysis and first-principles calculations, the heterointerface between FeS2 and N-doped graphene is found to play an essential role in improving electronic conductivity and facilitating Na+ diffusion kinetics. The uniform N-doped graphene coating also helps sustain good structural stability, which is revealed in morphology evolution examination. Because of the chemical and structural synergistic effect, FeS2/N-G can realize the robust and fast sodium-ion storage with delivering a reversible capacity of 251.7 mAh g−1 over 10,000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The superior electrochemical performance and simple synthetic procedure of FeS2/N-G demonstrate the feasibility of applying FeS2/N-G as a potential anode material for sodium-ion batteries.",Applied Surface Science
Promoted rate and cycling capability of Li–S batteries enabled by targeted selection of co-solvent for the electrolyte,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Lithium sulfur (Li–S) batteries are considered as promising candidates for high-energy-density battery systems owing to the high theoretical capacity of sulfur (1675 mAh g−1) and low cost of raw materials. However, their practical application is hampered by low rate capability and rapid degradation of capacity, arising from the passivation of the cathode by lithium sulfides (Li2S2/Li2S) deposited during discharge and low interfacial stability of the Li anode. Herein, we report on a comprehensive strategy to select co-solvent to the electrolyte to regulate the deposition of lithium sulfides during charge-discharge process. We show that addition of a co-solvent with high solubility, and strong interaction with Li2S to a conventional electrolyte effectively mitigates the formation of a passivating layer on the sulfur cathode and dramatically improves the interfacial stability of the Li anode. We demonstrate that Sulfolane (SL) has these properties and that a Li–S cell with an electrolyte containing 6 vol% SL exhibits outstanding cyclic performance (0.083% decay per cycle) and rate capability (capacity density of 765 mAh g−1 at rate of 1.0C). Thus, we provide a facile strategy for the selection of co-solvent for improved performance of Li–S batteries, realizing their practical application for high-energy-density battery systems.",Energy Storage Materials
Reinforcing concentrated phosphate electrolytes with in-situ polymerized skeletons for robust quasi-solid lithium metal batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Current lithium metal batteries are haunted by stability issues and safety concerns that are critically linked to the growth of dendritic lithium. A quasi-solid electrolyte is designed that is non-flammable and is capable of suppressing dendrites by in-situ polymerizing a poly (methyl methacrylate) skeleton to support phosphate-based electrolytes with high salt concentrations. By varying the polymer-to-electrolyte ratio, we reveal that there is a strong interplay between the mechanical strength, the ionic conductivity, and the ability to suppress dendrites. A carefully chosen composition leads to a quasi-solid electrolyte with a high ionic conductivity of 0.11 mS cm−1, a wide electrochemical window up to 4.8 V vs. Li/Li+, and the ability to suppress lithium dendrites at high current densities. Stable lithium plating and stripping is achieved using such electrolyte at a current density of 1.2 mA cm−2, a two-fold increase compared with its liquid counterpart. A lithium-metal battery using a LiFePO4 cathode with a high active material loading of ~15 mg cm−2 based on the quasi-solid electrolyte is demonstrated which exhibits high specific capacity of over 100 mAh g−1 and is able to be cycled 150 times without obvious capacity decay. The current work offers a practical solution to the safety concerns as well as the stability issues of lithium metal batteries.",Energy Storage Materials

A low-cost intermediate temperature Fe/Graphite battery for grid-scale energy storage,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Due to their compactness, storage/supply flexibility, modularity and factory manufacturability, batteries are excellent candidates for large scale energy storage applications. However, the widespread application of most batteries hitherto developed is hindered by their high cost. Here, an intermediate temperature molten salt battery is developed that emphatically resolves this issue by using all earth-abundant and cheap elements. Operated at 170 °C, the cell comprises of an Fe metal anode, NaCl saturated NaAlCl4 electrolyte and an AlCl4 − intercalated graphite cathode in the fully charged state. It has a capacity retention of 85% after nearly 10,000 cycles. After characterizing the anode, it was determined that the high reversibility of the Fe to FeCl2 solid state transformation are responsible for the absence of dendritic growth on such a metal anode. Different electrode capacity matching strategies are discussed in the context of ensuring safe operation during overcharging. Finally, the overall material cost of the Fe/Graphite cell is estimated to be 33.9 $ kWh−1, which can potentially meet the demands of the commercial energy storage market.",Energy Storage Materials
One-dimensional nanomaterials toward electrochemical sodium-ion storage applications via electrospinning,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The demand for energy storage technologies is rapidly increasing due to the development of grid-scale energy storage applications. Sodium-ion storage devices have been considered as potential candidates for large-scale energy storage systems owing to the natural abundance and low price of sodium resources. As a cost-effective and versatile method, electrospinning has been used to fabricate designed one-dimensional architectures with targeted components for advanced energy storage systems.

Advanced carbon nanostructures for future high performance sodium metal anodes,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Metallic sodium is a promising anode material due to its remarkably high theoretical capacity (1165 mA h g−1) and favorable redox voltage (−2.71 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode). However, unstable solid-electrolyte-interface (SEI) film and uncontrollable dendritic sodium formation induce low Coulombic efficiency, inferior cycling performance and even severe safety issues, dragging the sodium metal anode out of practical applications. Recently, the reviving of lithium metal and application of related characterization techniques bring a new era of the alkali metal anode. Carbonaceous materials have been employed as the interface engineering layer or the host of sodium metal. The advantageous of carbon nanostructure are including high mechanical strength, low weight, high conductivity, various nanoarchitecture, large surface area, easy functionalization, and sustainable. With these merits, sodium metal is guided and uniformly deposited into/through carbon nanostructures without dendrite formation as the stable sodium metal anode. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the strategies of suppressing the dendritic sodium by carbon nanostructures, and comprehensively analysis the related dendrite depression mechanism. We expect that this work can provide important insights into scientific and practical application of sodium metal batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Rationalizing Electrocatalysis of Li–S Chemistry by Mediator Design: Progress and Prospects,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery is regarded as a next-generation energy storage system due to its conspicuous merits in high theoretical capacity (1672 mAh g−1), overwhelming energy density (2600 Wh kg−1), and the cost-effectiveness of sulfur. However, the practical application of Li–S batteries is still handicapped by a multitude of key challenges, mainly pertaining to fatal lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics.

Single-atom transition metals supported on black phosphorene for electrochemical nitrogen reduction,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is one of the most promising routes to produce ammonia under mild conditions. Black phosphorene (BP) has attracted wide attention as an NRR electrocatalyst owing to its high Fermi level and unique electronic structure. However, the low intrinsic activity of surface sites greatly restricts its application in the electrochemical NRR. In this work, we theoretically designed a series of single-atom transition metals anchored on the BP surface with MP3 (M = Fe, Mn, Cr, Mo, W, V and Nb) active sites for the NRR via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By taking stability, activity and selectivity into consideration, the single-atom W-anchored BP was selected as a promising candidate for the NRR. The energy-favorable enzymatic pathway on W@BP (W atoms adsorb on the surface of BP) and the hybrid pathway on W-BP (W atoms substitute the surface P atoms of BP) have reaction onset potentials of 0.46 and 0.42 V, respectively, indicating that the single-atom W-anchored BP shows high activity towards the NRR. This high performance originates from the WP3 active sites, which act as an electron adaptor to activate N2 by donating electrons, thereby greatly regulating the charge transfer between BP and the reaction intermediates. This study proposes a promising active catalyst and provides theoretical guidance to construct BP-supported transition metal single-atom electrocatalysts for the NRR.",Nanoscale
Toward heat-tolerant potassium batteries based on pyrolyzed selenium disulfide/polyacrylonitrile positive electrode and gel polymer electrolyte,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.K-S batteries have attracted increasing research attention as promising energy storage systems. However, they suffer from slow reaction kinetics, which is attributed to the large radius of the potassium ion and insulating nature of sulfur. In addition, good heat tolerance of K-S batteries is crucial but not easy to realize due to the low melting point of potassium metal. Herein, we report a K-S battery that can be operated at both high and room temperatures with remarkable electrochemical performance using pyrolyzed selenium disulfide/polyacrylonitrile (SeS2-CPAN) as the positive electrode and a gel polymer as the electrolyte. SeS2-CPAN was prepared via calcination. Utilizing the advantages of both sulfur and selenium, the battery delivered a remarkable reversible capacity of 263 mA h g-1 (840.3 mA h gSeS2-1) at 100 mA g-1 and excellent rate performance (152.7 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1) at room temperature. When the temperature was increased to 50 °C, the K//SeS2-CPAN cell with the liquid electrolyte and porous separator could not be cycled. However, with the gel polymer electrolyte, the cell delivered an initial reversible capacity of 304.9 and 229.6 mA h g-1 (974.1 and 733.5 mA h gSeS2-1) at 100 and 500 mA g-1, respectively, and it exhibited good cycle and rate performances as well. The gel polymer electrolyte mitigates the penetration of softened potassium and circumvents the short circuit, leading to remarkable electrochemical performance at a high temperature. Thus, this study demonstrates an effective and facile strategy to extend the application of potassium batteries, especially at high temperatures. In addition, the reaction mechanism and kinetics between SeS2-CPAN and potassium are discussed.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Facile-Processed Nanocarbon-Promoted Sulfur Cathode for Highly Stable Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 The AuthorsRoom temperature sodium-sulfur batteries using bulk sulfur materials attract extensive attention as low-cost and large-scale energy storage devices. Hu et al. report the facile processing of nanocarbon to promote a bulk-sized commercial sulfur cathode, enabling room temperature Na-S batteries with high Coulombic efficiency and capacity retention, and long cycling life. © 2020 The AuthorsRoom temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries hold great promise as the next-generation cost-effective energy storage systems. However, their practical implementation is still plagued by the low reversible capacity of a bulk-sized commercial sulfur cathode with low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycling stability. Here, we report a highly stable room temperature Na-S battery using a facile-processed, nanocarbon-promoted, bulk-sized commercial sulfur cathode and a polymer electrolyte. This processed nanocarbon possesses a high binding affinity to sulfur and polysulfides, largely facilitating the sulfur reaction kinetics and leading to high reversible capacity. Meanwhile, by applying a thin coating of the facile-processed nanocarbon on the polymer electrolyte, dead sulfur formation can be avoided, contributing to greatly enhanced capacity retention. Our Na-S battery delivers a reversible capacity of >700 mAh g−1 with near-100% Coulombic efficiency and the ultrahigh capacity retention of 98.2% at 0.2C after 200 cycles.",Cell Reports Physical Science
Electrode Degradation in Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2020 American Chemical Society.Although Li-ion batteries have emerged as the battery of choice for electric vehicles and large-scale smart grids, significant research efforts are devoted to identifying materials that offer higher energy density, longer cycle life, lower cost, and/or improved safety compared to those of conventional Li-ion batteries based on intercalation electrodes. By moving beyond intercalation chemistry, gravimetric capacities that are 2-5 times higher than that of conventional intercalation materials (e.g., LiCoO2 and graphite) can be achieved. The transition to higher-capacity electrode materials in commercial applications is complicated by several factors.

Elastic and Plastic Characteristics of Sodium Metal,"Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.Sodium metal holds promise as an anode material for rechargeable batteries due to its large theoretical charging capacity, low electrochemical potential, earth abundance, and low cost. However, a number of concerns remain that must be addressed prior to practical implementation, particularly Na's propensity to form unstable morphologies during electrochemical deposition. Given the importance of mechanical deformation in this process, unlocking the potential of sodium metal as an anode material requires a thorough understanding of its mechanical properties. To this end, we evaluate the mechanical properties of sodium metal at room temperature through a combination of bulk compression, microhardness, and nanoindentation tests. With regard to elastic properties, nanoindentation testing produced an elastic modulus of 3.9 ± 0.5 GPa. With regard to plastic properties, bulk compression testing revealed the flow stress at 0.08 strain as varying between 102 and 254 kPa at strain rates between 10-4 and 10-2 s-1. Nanoindentation indicated a decrease in hardness from 26.6 to 2.3 MPa at target P/P = 0.05 s-1 as the indentation depth increased from 0.25 to 10 μm, while microhardness testing indicated hardness values between 1.6 and 1.1 MPa at depths varying between 50 and 130 μm. We perform finite element simulations to relate length scales in these measurements (e.g., depth) to physical lengths scales relevant to battery applications. We also found that Na exhibits a marked strain-rate sensitivity, with a strain-rate sensitivity exponent of m = 0.14 from nanoindentation and m = 0.20 from bulk compression. Likewise, indentation demonstrated that Na is even more susceptible to creep than is Li metal. Overall, our studies indicate that Na metal is extremely soft, readily creeps, and exhibits pronounced size effects. We discuss the implications of these properties relative to other candidate anode materials of rechargeable batteries. Most notably, Na's greater propensity to creep than Li, in turn, has implications for charging rate capability in solid-state batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Free‐standing reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube paper for flexible sodium‐ion battery applications,"© 2020 by the authors.We propose a flexible, binder‐free and free‐standing carbonaceous paper fabricated via electrostatic spray deposition using reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (rGO/CNT) as a promising electrode material for flexible sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs). The as‐prepared rGO/CNT paper exhibits a three‐dimensional (3D) layered structure by employing rGO as conductive frameworks to provide sodium‐storage active sites and CNT as spacer to increase rGO interlayer distance and benefit the diffusion kinetics of sodium ions. Consequently, the rGO/CNT paper delivers an enhanced sodium ion storage capacity of 166.8 mAh g–1 at 50 mA g‐1, retaining an average capacity of 101.4 mAh g–1 when current density sets back 100 mA g–1 after cycling at various current rates. An average capacity of 50 mAh g–1 at 200 mA g–1 was stabilized when cycling up to 300 cycles. The well‐maintained electrochemical performance of free‐standing rGO/CNT paper is due to the well‐established hybrid 3D nanostructures, which demonstrates our carbon based material fabricated by a facile approach can be applied as one of the high‐performance and low‐cost electrode materials for applications in flexible energy storage devices.",Molecules
Ameliorating Interfacial Issues of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2/Poly(propylene carbonate) by Introducing Graphene Interlayer for All-Solid-State Lithium Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimInterfacial side reaction mechanism between poly(propylene carbonate) solid polymer electrolyte (PPC-SPE) and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode (c-NCM) is investigated. Ni3+ and Co4+ species generated by electrochemical oxidization process can decompose poly(propylene carbonate) to aldehyde. To address this interface issue, a graphene interlayer is introduced to the LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode surface via a facile method to improve cycle stability, rate capability and interfacial resistance. After 50 cycles at 0.3 C, the capacity retention of G@c-NCM is 97.9 % and the resistance is less than 20 Ω, the improved electrochemical properties can be attributed to the graphene interlayer slows the side reaction, facilitates interfacial charge-transfer process and stabilizes the cathode structure. These results demonstrate that modifying LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) cathode surface with graphene interlayer is conducive to enhance the electrochemical performance of all-solid-state lithium batteries.",ChemistrySelect
The effect of co2 contamination in rechargeable non-aqueous sodium-air batteries,"© 2020 Author(s).Metal-air batteries have higher theoretical specific energies than existing rechargeable batteries including Li-ion batteries. Among metal-air batteries, the Na-O2 battery has gained much attention due to its low discharge/charge overpotentials (∼100 mV) at relatively high current densities (0.2 mA/cm2), high electrical energy efficiency (90%), high theoretical energy density, and low cost. However, there is no information reported regarding the effect of CO2 contamination in non-aqueous Na-air batteries. Density functional theory has, here, been applied to study the effect of low concentrations of CO2 contamination on NaO2 and Na2O2 growth/depletion reaction pathways and overpotentials. This was done on step surfaces of discharge products in non-aqueous Na-air batteries. Adsorption energies of CO2 at various nucleation sites for both step surfaces were determined, and results revealed that CO2 preferentially binds at the step valley sites of (001) NaO2 and 11̄00 Na2O2 surfaces with binding energies of-0.65 eV and-2.67 eV, respectively. CO2 blocks the step nucleation site and influences the reaction pathways and overpotentials due to carbonate formation. The discharge electrochemical overpotential increases remarkably from 0.14 V to 0.30 V and from 0.69 V to 1.26 V for NaO2 and Na2O2 surfaces, respectively. CO2 contamination is thus drastically impeding the growth/depletion mechanism pathways and increases the overpotentials of the surface reaction mechanism, hampering the performance of the battery. Avoiding CO2 contamination from intake of gas and electrolyte decomposition is thus critical in development of Na-air batteries.",Journal of Chemical Physics
PIM-1-based carbon-sulfur composites for sodium-sulfur batteries that operate without the shuttle effect,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.Room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries have distinct advantages over other next generation batteries because of their use of abundant and inexpensive resources with high theoretical capacities of 1166 and 1675 mA h g-1, namely for sodium and sulfur. However, problematic side reactions, called the shuttle effect, lead to low coulombic efficiency during cycling. Here, we propose a new strategy to fundamentally suppress the shuttle phenomenon by combining two widely used concepts, covalent bonds and physical confinement, through the preparation of a PIM-1-based carbon-sulfur composite. This sulfur-carbon material was prepared through one-step heat treatment of a mixture of sulfur and PIM-1. The resulting sulfur-carbon composites have characteristics of both ∼0.5 nm-sized ultra-micropores and covalent bonding in a single material, which fundamentally obstruct the dissolution of polysulfide into the electrolyte. This strategy led to long cycling stability over 250 cycles, with a capacity of 556 mA h gs-1 and a coulombic efficiency of approximately 100%.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Pathways to Triplet or Singlet Oxygen during the Dissociation of Alkali Metal Superoxides: Insights by Multireference Calculations of Molecular Model Systems,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRecent experimental investigations demonstrated the generation of singlet oxygen during charging at high potentials in lithium/oxygen batteries. To contribute to the understanding of the underlying chemical reactions a key step in the mechanism of the charging process, namely, the dissociation of the intermediate lithium superoxide to oxygen and lithium, was investigated. Therefore, the corresponding dissociation paths of the molecular model system lithium superoxide (LiO2) were studied by CASSCF/CASPT2 calculations. The obtained results indicate the presence of different dissociation paths over crossing points of different electronic states, which lead either to the energetically preferred generation of triplet oxygen or the energetically higher lying formation of singlet oxygen. The dissociation to the corresponding superoxide anion is energetically less preferred. The understanding of the detailed reaction mechanism allows the design of strategies to avoid the formation of singlet oxygen and thus to potentially minimize the degradation of materials in alkali metal/oxygen batteries. The calculations demonstrate a qualitatively similar but energetically shifted behavior for the homologous alkali metals sodium and potassium and their superoxide species. Fundamental differences were found for the covalently bound hydroperoxyl radical.",Chemistry - A European Journal
Design of porous calcium phosphate based gel polymer electrolyte for Quasi-solid state sodium ion battery,"© 2020The design of a suitable separator is an effective approach to enhance the performance as well as the safety of a rechargeable battery. The conventional glass fiber separator has electrolyte leakage due to the random distribution of pores in the structure. The design of a gel polymer electrolyte with phosphorus containing compound is considered to be safer for the operation of a rechargeable sodium ion battery. Hence, we have developed a gel polymer using hydroxyapatite, a calcium phosphate-based compound in poly (vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene)-poly (butyl methacrylate) blend membrane by a simple solution casting technique. The developed membrane has an ionic conductivity of 1.086 × 10− 3 S cm− 1 with an electrochemical stability of up to 4.9 V, good porosity and electrolyte uptake, thereby making it a promising electrolyte to be used in a rechargeable sodium ion battery. To demonstrate its feasibility, the electrochemical properties of Na3V2(PO4)3/C are investigated using the prepared gel polymer electrolyte. The sodium ion cell using gel polymer electrolyte exhibits a specific capacity of 97 mAh g− 1 at 4 C which is about 33.5% enhancement in specific capacity when compared to the cell with the conventional glass fiber membrane. This study illustrates the feasibility of using gel polymer electrolyte as a replacement to the existing glass fiber separator.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
Cobalt-doped pyrite for Na11Sn2SbS11.5Se0.5 electrolyte based all-solid-state sodium battery with enhanced capacity,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability of the electrolyte layer as well as the capacity of cathode material play pivotal roles for enhancing the electrochemical performances of all-solid-state sodium batteries. Herein, Na11Sn2SbS11.5Se0.5 solid electrolyte with ionic conductivity of 6.6 × 10−4 S cm−1 is synthesized. Meanwhile, Na11Sn2SbS11.5Se0.5-Na3PS4 electrolyte bilayer is employed to address the unstability of Na11Sn2SbS11.5Se0.5 against sodium.

Tailoring the structure of supported δ-MnO2 nanosheets to raise pseudocapacitance by surface-modified carbon cloth,"© 2019Coupling electrode composed of carbonaceous materials and metal oxides can effectively raise pseudocapacitance; however, due to the weak interaction between carbonaceous materials and metal oxides, structural control of the resultant coupling electrode remains a great challenge. Herein, surface-modified carbon cloth (SMCC), which is obtained by carbonizing the hydrothermal products of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and glucose solution on carbon cloth (CC), is employed to regulate in-situ growth of δ-MnO2 in a KMnO4 and H2SO4 solution at hydrothermal condition. Structural characterizations indicate that surface modification renders SMCC to possess an oxygen-species-rich superhydrophilic surface, which in turn enables the supported δ-MnO2 to form the dense ultrathin nanosheets and abundant oxygen-vacancy (Vo) structure. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the MnO2/SMCC can exhibit a specific capacitance of 508 F g−1 (792.5 C g−1) at 1 A g−1 under working potential range from −0.3 to 1.26 VAg/AgCl in three-electrode system, outperforming previously-reported δ-MnO2-based materials. Further, the detailed structural investigations identify that the oxygen species on SMCC dominate the generation of Vo in δ-MnO2 by reducing thickness and interface bonding, and the Vo in δ-MnO2 improves the pesudocapacitance by promoting the transition of Mn2+ to Mn4+.",Journal of Power Sources
Site-Specific Sodiation Mechanisms of Selenium in Microporous Carbon Host,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.We combined advanced TEM (HRTEM, HAADF, EELS) with solid-state (SS)MAS NMR and electroanalytical techniques (GITT, etc.) to understand the site-specific sodiation of selenium (Se) encapsulated in a nanoporous carbon host. The architecture employed is representative of a wide number of electrochemically stable and rate-capable Se-based sodium metal battery (SMB) cathodes. SSNMR demonstrates that during the first sodiation, the Se chains are progressively cut to form an amorphous mixture of polyselenides of varying lengths, with no evidence for discrete phase transitions during sodiation. It also shows that Se nearest the carbon pore surface is sodiated first, leading to the formation of a core-shell compositional profile. HRTEM indicates that the vast majority of the pore-confined Se is amorphous, with the only localized presence of nanocrystalline equilibrium Na2Se2 (hcp) and Na2Se (fcc). A nanoscale fracture of terminally sodiated Na-Se is observed by HAADF, with SSNMR, indicating a physical separation of some Se from the carbon host after the first cycle. GITT reveals a 3-fold increase in Na+ diffusivity at cycle 2, which may be explained by the creation of extra interfaces. These combined findings highlight the complex phenomenology of electrochemical phase transformations in nanoconfined materials, which may profoundly differ from their ""free"" counterparts.",Nano Letters

Combination of experimental and theoretical approaches can be used to develop insight into the relationship between electrochemical behavior of sulfur redox and metal stripping-plating and the structural properties of electrode materials. With metal-sulfur batteries, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are a suitable model with which to connect and test experimental results with theoretical predictions and to explore structure-property relationships. Here, through the view of combining experimental and theoretical approaches, we explore sulfur redox conversion on 2D nanomaterials in various reaction stages and critically review crucial factors affecting 2D nanomaterials as artificial solid electrolyte interfaces (SEIs) and host materials in protecting Li and Na metal anodes. We conclude with a focused discussion on promising research orientations for developing high-performance metal-sulfur batteries. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Through a combination of advanced experimental characterizations and theoretical computations based on 2D materials, an in-depth understanding of structure-property relationships in Li/Na-sulfur batteries has been obtained.

Dual Play of Chitin-Derived N-Doped Carbon Nanosheets Enabling High-Performance Na-SeS2 Half/Full Cells,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRoom-temperature Na−S batteries hold great promise for developing next-generation battery system with the advantages of abundant resource, high energy density, and long lifetime. However, limited by sluggish kinetics, Na−S batteries frequently suffer from low utilization of active materials, rapid capacity decay during cycling and poor rate capability. Herein, we propose an advanced cathode with SeS2 tightly impregnated in chitin-derived rich nitrogen carbon nanosheets (termed as CCN/SeS2). The CCN/SeS2 exhibits superb rate capability (422 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1) and long cycle stability (566 mAh g−1 after 470 cycles with a capacity decay rate of 0.056 % per cycle). High content and high loading cathodes are also fabricated to meet the requirement of practical application. The results of electrochemical tests and characterization demonstrate that CCN/SeS2 has preponderance in lowering overpotential and reaction resistances, prompting the diffusion of sodium ions and achieving the uniform deposition of discharge products. For the first time, a full cell based on all-chitin materials (CCN/SeS2 cathode and CCN anode) is assembled, which exhibits favorable cycling performance over 100 cycles. The as-obtained cell using a green and low-cost carbon and SeS2 inheriting the advantages of Se and S may pave a new way to energy storage.",Batteries and Supercaps

High-performance room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery enabled by electrocatalytic sodium polysulfides full conversion,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na-S) batteries are highly desirable for grid-scale stationary energy storage due to their low cost; however, short cycling stability caused by the incomplete conversion of sodium polysulfides is a major issue for their application. Herein, we introduce an effective sulfiphilic host, gold nanodots decorated on hierarchical N-doped carbon microspheres (CN/Au/S), to achieve completely reversible conversion reactions in the S cathode by electrocatalyzing the low-kinetics conversion of Na2S4 into NaS2 (discharge process) or S (charge process). Besides, gold nanodots and N-doped carbon can increase the conductivity of the S cathode and provide strong polar-polar adsorption of sodium polysulfides to alleviate the shuttling effects. When serving as the cathode, the CN/Au/S composite can realize enhanced sulfur utilization, excellent cycling stability, and outstanding rate capability. This work deepens our understanding of the catalytic effect of gold atoms on sulfur molecules, opening a new avenue for cathode design and development of advanced RT-Na-S batteries.",Energy and Environmental Science
Covalent fixing of sulfur in metal-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.With its earth abundance and two-electron-transfer reaction mechanism, sulfur has been driving the rapid growth of metal-sulfur batteries. The practical performance of metal-sulfur batteries, however, is restricted by the notorious electrode processes of sulfur (such as low conductivity, intermediate loss, mass crossover, etc.). Sulfur conversion reactions can be stabilized and promoted through a surface immobilization strategy via physical confinement and chemical adsorption effects. As an emerging method in the field, covalent-bonding sulfur materials have demonstrated promise for metal-sulfur batteries. The covalent fixing of sulfur reinforces the molecular interactions between sulfur and the cathode matrix at the bulk level. In this review, we attempt to address the covalent fixing concept on the basis of the emerging studies related to covalent sulfur-containing compounds and composites in various rechargeable metal-sulfur batteries. Firstly, we briefly discuss the classification of sulfur fixing strategies and identify the uniqueness of covalently stabilized sulfur for metal-sulfur batteries. Secondly, we summarize the state-of-the-art covalent sulfur-based materials as well as their synthetic chemistry. Thirdly, we focus on lithium-sulfur batteries that feature cathodes with covalent sulfur active materials, including reaction mechanisms and material innovations. Advances in alternative alkaline metal-sulfur battery systems (sodium-sulfur and potassium-sulfur) involving covalent fixing of sulfur are also discussed. Finally, the prospective opportunities of applying the covalent fixing strategy to optimize the sulfur redox process are commented on. This contribution is anticipated to place the covalent fixing of sulfur into the spotlight and to encourage more efforts in this challenging cross-disciplinary area of organic/polymer chemistry, materials science, electrochemistry and energy technologies.",Energy and Environmental Science
A High-Kinetics Sulfur Cathode with a Highly Efficient Mechanism for Superior Room-Temperature Na–S Batteries,"© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimApplications of room-temperature–sodium sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries are currently impeded by the insulating nature of sulfur, the slow redox kinetics of sulfur with sodium, and the dissolution and migration of sodium polysulfides. Herein, a novel micrometer-sized hierarchical S cathode supported by FeS2 electrocatalyst, which is grown in situ in well-confined carbon nanocage assemblies, is presented. The hierarchical carbon matrix can provide multiple physical entrapment to polysulfides, and the FeS2 nanograins exhibit a low Na-ion diffusion barrier, strong binding energy, and high affinity for sodium polysulfides. Their combination makes it an ideal sulfur host to immobilize the polysulfides and achieve reversible conversion of polysulfides toward Na2S. Importantly, the hierarchical S cathode is suitable for large-scale production via the inexpensive and green spray-drying method. The porous hierarchical S cathode offers a high sulfur content of 65.5 wt%, and can deliver high reversible capacity (524 mAh g−1 over 300 cycles at 0.1 A g−1) and outstanding rate capability (395 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 for 850 cycles), holding great promise for both scientific research and real application.",Advanced Materials
Sodium Sulfide Cathodes Superseding Hard Carbon Pre-sodiation for the Production and Operation of Sodium–Sulfur Batteries at Room Temperature,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThis study demonstrates for the first time a room temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) full cell assembled based on a pristine hard carbon (HC) anode combined with a nanostructured Na2S/C cathode. The development of cells without the demanding, time-consuming and costly pre-sodiation of the HC anode is essential for the realization of practically relevant RT Na–S prototype batteries. New approaches for Na2S/C cathode fabrication employing carbothermal reduction of Na2SO4 at varying temperatures (660 to 1060 °C) are presented. Initial evaluation of the resulting cathodes in a dedicated cell setup reveals 36 stable cycles and a capacity of 740 mAh gS−1, which correlates to ≈85% of the maximum value known from literature on Na2S-based cells. The Na2S/C cathode with the highest capacity utilization is implemented into a full cell concept applying a pristine HC anode. Various full cell electrolyte compositions with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive have been combined with a special charging procedure during the first cycle supporting in situ solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on the HC anode to obtain increased cycling stability and cathode utilization. The best performing cell setup has delivered a total of 350 mAh gS−1, representing the first functional full cell based on a Na2S/C cathode and a pristine HC anode today.",Advanced Energy Materials
A solid-electrolyte-reinforced separator through single-step electrophoretic assembly for safe high-capacity lithium ion batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.In rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the separator undergoes stresses in repeated charge and discharge processes. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) gel separators own excellent thermal stability and electrolyte wettability, but their limited mechanical strength cannot sustain severe strains under the conditions of large Li ion fluxes, mechanical and thermal shocks of batteries. In this report, a solid-electrolyte-reinforced gel separator is prepared through a single-step electrophoretic deposition on a stable surfactant-free colloid of PVDF-HFP and Al-doped Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LLZTO). The LLZTO/PVDF-HFP separator owns a 3D laminated structure, a mechanical strength of 28.6 MPa, a room-temperature ionic conductivity of 7.13 × 10−4 S cm−1 and improved thermal stability.

Nickel Hollow Spheres Concatenated by Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Fibers for Enhancing Electrochemical Kinetics of Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe high energy density of room temperature (RT) sodium–sulfur batteries (Na-S) usually rely on the efficient conversion of polysulfide to sodium sulfide during discharging and sulfur recovery during charging, which is the rate-determining step in the electrochemical reaction process of Na-S batteries. In this work, a 3D network (Ni-NCFs) host composed by nitrogen-doped carbon fibers (NCFs) and Ni hollow spheres is synthesized by electrospinning. In this novel design, each Ni hollow unit not only can buffer the volume fluctuation of S during cycling, but also can improve the conductivity of the cathode along the carbon fibers. Meanwhile, the result reveals that a small amount of Ni is polarized during the sulfur-loading process forming a polar NiS bond. Furthermore, combining with the nitrogen-doped carbon fibers, the Ni-NCFs composite can effectively adsorb soluble polysulfide intermediate, which further facilitates the catalysis of the Ni unit for the redox of sodium polysulfide. In addition, the in situ Raman is employed to supervise the variation of polysulfide during the charging and discharging process. As expected, the freestanding S@Ni-NCFs cathode exhibits outstanding rate capability and excellent cycle performance.",Advanced Science
Understanding of nitrogen fixation electro catalyzed by molybdenum–iron carbide through the experiment and theory,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdThe electrochemical method is considered being a sustainable alternative to the industrial Haber-Bosch process (150–350 atm, 350–550 °C) because it can produce ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O) at room temperature and pressure. However, since the N≡N triple bond in N2 is one of the strongest bonds in nature, it requires a more negative potential for N2 reduction, which often leads to violent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolysis systems. Therefore, it is a great challenge for the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (ENRR) to find catalysts that can reduce the energy barrier of N2 fixation and inhibit the HER. Herein, inspired by the Mo–Fe site in the biological nitrogenase, we found that the catalyst containing Mo3Fe3C active material has excellent N2-fixing catalytic performance and can effectively inhibit the HER. At −0.05 V vs RHE, the Faraday efficiency (FE) of ENRR was as high as 27.0%. In addition, we innovatively used the Fourier-transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTACV) to explore the electron transfer process in ENRR, indicating that Mo3Fe3C is more conducive to reducing N2 at low potential. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, compared with Mo2C and Fe3C, Mo3Fe3C is more helpful in promoting N2 activation and hydrogenation. Due to the synergistic effect of the Mo–Fe site, N2 hydrogenation needs to overcome a lower energy barrier in potential-determining step (PDS). Our research extends the knowledge into bimetallic active sites in ENRR and provides a new insight for the subsequent synthesis of high selectivity catalysts.",Nano Energy
Electrode Engineering by Atomic Layer Deposition for Sodium-Ion Batteries: From Traditional to Advanced Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as one of the most promising and competitive energy storage systems due to abundant sodium resources and its environmentally friendly features. However, further improvements in the engineering of the SIB electrode/electrolyte interphase—which directly determines the Na-ion transfer behavior, material structure stability, and sodiation/desodiation property—are highly recommended to meet the continuously increasing requirements for secondary power sources. Reasonably speaking, to promote SIBs, the advanced and controllable interphase/electrode engineering approach exhibits promise by rationally designing the bulk electrode and generating a well-defined interphase. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology, with atomic-scale deposition, superior uniformity, excellent conformality, and a self-limiting nature, is thus expected to address the current challenges facing SIBs in terms of low energy density, limited cycling life, and structural instability, and to promote innovations such as multifunctional electrodes and nanostructured materials for advanced SIBs. This review summarizes and discusses the most recent advancements in the interphase engineering of SIBs by ALD via modifying traditional electrodes and designing advanced electrodes (such as 3D, organic, and protected sodium metal electrodes). Furthermore, based on the recent critical progress and current scientific understanding, future perspectives for the engineering of next-generation SIB electrodes by ALD can be provided.",Advanced Functional Materials

Boosting energy and power performance of aqueous energy storage by engineering ultra-fine metallic VSe2 nanoparticles anchored reduced graphene oxide,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Metallic transition metal selenides are broadly applied in energy storages because of their excellent electro-conductivity and high theoretical capacity. However, the poor cycling life which comes from irreversible volume expansion and the formation of soluble selenides intermediates make it hardly use in commercialization. In this work, ultra-fine metallic VSe2 nanoparticles anchored reduced graphene oxide composite (VSe2/rGO) is prepared by an accessible one-step hydrothermal method. The small particle size of VSe2 and the unique structure endows the composite a high specific capacity of 156.8 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, and maintain 53.2% of original capacity even at 15 A g−1. In addition, the anchoring effect of the composite process can effectively improve the durability of the VSe2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, an aqueous energy storage system based on the prepared VSe2/rGO cathode and a carbon coated Fe3O4 nanoparticle anode is assembled with considerable energy and power densities. This study sheds lights on the application of metallic VSe2 for high performance cathode materials for energy storage.",Journal of Power Sources
A Highly Crosslinked and Conductive Sulfur-Rich Copolymer with Grafted Polyaniline for Stable Cycling Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS""). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.Lithium-sulfur batteries offer promisingly high energy density, but suffer from low lithium ion diffusion and lithium polysulfide shuttling, resulting in capacity loss. Herein, we present a novel sulfur-rich copolymer combination Poly(S-r-DIB)-g-PANI (SBPA) to address these chronic issues. Two organic compounds 1,3-diisopropylbenzene and p-aminostyrene are sequentially grafted to sulfur forming multiple crosslinking carbon-sulfur bonds; the amino group of p-aminostyrene then provides a site for aniline polymerization. The combination of the copolymer graftings create a novel structure of highly crosslinked copolymer chains with covalently grafted polyaniline. As cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries, the sulfur has high specific capacity, impressive cycling stability, and good rate capability, i.e. 1089 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C after 160 cycles (∼84% retention) and 612 mAh g-1 after 450 cycles at 0.5 C (∼73% retention). Compared to controls of sulfur/polyaniline mixtures or to non-aniline-reacted sulfur-copolymer, the polyaniline crosslinked copolymer has superior capacity retention and rate capability due to the unique combination of crosslinked sulfur and grafted polyaniline.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
Bio-based electric devices,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.The development of bio-based materials is one of the biggest challenges of our society as fossil resources are becoming scarcer. Decoupling of our economy from the fossil resource base by developing a bio-based one can only be successful, if advanced materials are produced from renewable resources. There is a considerable potential of substitution in the field of electrochemical energy storage technologies (supercapacitors or batteries) and energy conversion systems (fuel cells), which are of central importance in the context of renewable energies and e-mobility. The capacity of the energy storage and conversion technologies is significantly determined by the used electrode materials, which currently are made of fossil activated carbon. Through carbonization of biomass (hydrothermal or pyrolysis) and following activation and functionalization of the carbon materials, bio-based materials can be produced in order to substitute the conventional counterparts. Currently, activated carbons from coconut shell are already used as electrode material in energy storage, but the huge potential of other biomass precursors remains unnoticed by the industry till now. Current research shows that the production of promising bio-based activated carbon or composite materials made of different biomasses and metal-oxides or heteroatoms is possible. However, correlations between the production parameters (e.g., carbonization temperature), physiochemical properties (e.g., inner surface area, surface functionalities), and their electrochemical performance still need further research. The objective must be to produce bio-based materials which are not only technically equal or better than their fossil counterparts, but also provide economic and ecological benefits. This chapter gives an overview about the operation principles and state-of-the-art in the field of energy storage and conversion systems to provide a deeper insight into the application potential of bio-based carbon materials.",Biobased Products and Industries
Eco-friendly process for facile pore control in thermally stable cellulose acetate utilizing zinc(II) nitrate for water-treatment,"© 2019 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering ChemistryThe generation of pores in cellulose acetate (CA) using water pressure and inorganic materials was investigated and succeeded in fabricating straight nanopores in polymer. In this study, we researched Zn(NO3)2·6H2O to have relatively larger ionic size instead of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O. When the CA/Ni(NO3)2·6H2O membrane was employed, the water flux was about 95 L/m2 h at water-pressure of 8 bar. However, the water flux through the CA/Zn(NO3)2·6H2O membrane was about 182 L/m2 h at the same water-pressure. This indicated that Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was more easily able to control the pore size than Ni(NO3)2·6H2O since both zinc salts and the plasticized parts by salts were readily removed by water-pressure.",Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry
Germanium telluride: Layered high-performance anode for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdGermanium telluride (GeTe) with a layered structure and a GeTe nanocomposite modified by amorphous carbon (GeTe/C) are prepared via a simple solid-state synthesis, and their electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries is evaluated. To determine the electrochemical sodiation/desodiation mechanism of the GeTe and GeTe/C, various ex situ analytical methods are employed. During sodiation, GeTe in both electrodes is converted into NaGe and Na2Te phases. By contrast, during desodiation, the converted NaGe and Na2Te phases in the only GeTe/C are completely recombined into the original GeTe phase. Because of the repeated conversion/recombination reactions during sodiation/desodiation, GeTe/C displays outstanding Na-ion storage characteristics, such as a high reversible first volumetric capacity of 662 mAh cm−3, a stable capacity retention of 98.5% up to after 100 cycles, and rapid rate capabilities of 704 mAh cm−3 at 1C and 630 mAh cm−3 at 3C. Therefore, the GeTe/C is expected to perform well as a high–capacity anode in rechargeable sodium-ion batteries.",Electrochimica Acta
Energy coefficients for comparison of aircraft supported by different propulsion systems,"© 2019Stakeholders envision introduction of electric and hybrid-electric aircraft into operation by 2035. First developments meet a series of challenges caused mostly by deficiencies (like low specific energy) of battery technology. Due to this, electric aircraft will have unacceptably large take-off weight or significantly reduced range. Energy factors (energy used per unit of work performed adapted to electric and hybrid-electric aircraft can support the evaluation of aircraft with different propulsion systems, and prediction of required battery technology and electric energy generation. Using the recommended energy factors, aircraft with different propulsion systems are comparable at the concept inspiration and conceptual design stages of new aircraft design. The results are clear and understandable. Energy intensity (evaluating the “aerodynamic goodness” at cruise flight) is about 10–60% lower (better) for full electric aircraft, but such aircraft have 50–80% less range and 40–230% greater take-off mass than comparable conventionally powered aircraft. Analysis of the used energy factors shows that the full electric small 4-seater aircraft may use less energy for flights up to 750 km range. Total energy used per unit of work done is 15–20% greater than total used energy during aircraft operations.",Energy

We focus on the repair mechanisms and performances of energy storage devices prepared from self-healing materials with a focus on electrodes and electrolytes. Since the research on these self-healing materials is still in its infancy, it has developed rapidly but still suffers from many limitations. Therefore, we discuss the challenges this research is currently facing and the opportunities for future development.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Preparation of porous FeS2-C/RG composite for sodium ion batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Pyrite (FeS2) is considered to be one of the most promising anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity, natural abundance, low cost and low toxicity, but the commercial process of FeS2 is always limited by its low conductivity and volume expansion during the charge-discharge process. Herein, a three-dimensional porous composite (FeS2-C/RG) is constructed using FeS2-C nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide through one-step vulcanization of PB (Prussian blue)/GO (graphene oxide) gel. As the anode material of SIBs, FeS2-C/RG exhibits high electrochemical performance benefiting from the unique three dimensional structure and small FeS2-C nanoparticles. The initial specific capacity can reach 1196 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and it can still remain 543.0 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. Even at 6 A g−1, the capacity could maintain 291.7 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles.

Memristive synapses with high reproducibility for flexible neuromorphic networks based on biological nanocomposites,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Memristive synapses from biomaterials are promising for building flexible and implantable artificial neuromorphic systems due to their remarkable mechanical and biological properties. However, these biological devices have relatively poor memristive switching characteristics, and thus fail to meet the requirement of neuromorphic networks for high learning accuracy. Here, memristive synapses based on carrageenan nanocomposites that possess desirable characteristics are demonstrated. These devices show highly reproducible analog resistive switching behaviors with 250 conductance states, low write noise, good write linearity, high retention of more than 104 s and endurance for at least 106 pulses. The enhanced switching properties are attributed to controllable and confined conductive filament growth, owing to the synergistic effect of self-assembled silver nanocluster doping and nanocone-shaped electrode contact. Moreover, the devices exhibit excellent reliability after 1000 bending cycles. Simulations including the non-ideal factors prove that the synaptic device array can operate with an online learning accuracy of 94.3%. These findings enable broader applications of biomaterials in flexible memristive devices and neuromorphic systems.",Nanoscale

At present, flexible lithium-ion battery dominates the consumer electronic markets, such as flexible displayers and wearable sensors, due to its high power and energy density. However, the limited lithium resourcesslow the sustainable development of batteries. Owing to abundant sodium resources and low cost, sodium-ion batteries have attracted more and more attention. Flexible sodium-ion batteries, which are expected to meet the future market demand, consist of electrode active materials, current collectors, electrolytes, and separators. The electrodes not only require high capa-city and electrical conductivity, but also need good mechanical flexibility to ensure that the flexible battery works properly under various deformations (bending, stretching, folding, etc.). Meanwhile, the flexible electrolytes and separators should maintain a stable interface with the electrodes while maintaining battery safety. However, these key materials are still imperfect which have hindered the development of flexible sodium-ion batteries. In addition, ordinary pouch-type flexible batteries cannot meet the miniaturization and wearability requirement of future electronic devices. Innovative and practical structural design and preparation techniques suitable for mass production are also in urgent need. Here, this review introduces the research efforts with respects to flexible sodium-ion battery, and provides elaborate descriptions about the electrode materials (including anode materials, cathode materials and conductive substrate), electrolytes, battery structure and preparation process. In addition, the existing problems of flexible sodium-ion batteries, such as high cost, poor safety, complicated preparation process and other issues, are critically discussed and analyzed. For further development, lower cost active materials and substrates of flexible sodium-ion batteries, as well as structural innovation are essential to solve the problems of flexible sodium-ion batteries.

Anisotropic Elastic Properties of Battery Anodes,"© 2020 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS""). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.Negative battery electrodes based on metals exhibit theoretical energy densities that surpass those of the intercalation-based anodes used in present-day Li-ion batteries. Nevertheless, metal anodes have a propensity to form dendrites during charging; thus, use of interfacial protection schemes or solid electrolytes (SE) may be necessary for these systems to be practical. The efficacy of these schemes are influenced by the interplay of the mechanical properties of the anode with those of the SE. To aid in the design of robust anode/SE interfaces, the present study employs Density Functional Theory calculations to assess the elastic properties of eight candidate anode materials: Li, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Al, and Si. The elastic constants, Young's modulus, and shear modulus are predicted as a function of temperature within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Anisotropy is assessed by resolving the moduli as a function of crystallographic direction. The alkali metals (Li, Na, and K) are predicted to have the smallest elastic moduli overall, and their moduli decrease with increasing atomic number. Regarding anisotropic behavior, Al and Mg are predicted to exhibit highly isotropic elastic properties, while the alkali metals are highly anisotropic. In the cubic systems, the crystallographic directions exhibiting extrema in the elastic properties are diametrically opposed: Under axial loading the stiffest (most compliant) orientation is 111 (100), while in shear 100 (111) is the stiffest (most compliant). Importantly, the maximum anisotropic shear modulus of some metals is observed to be more than twice as large as their respective polycrystalline values. In these cases the polycrystalline properties may be a poor approximation to the elastic behavior. Accounting for this anisotropy, the resistance to dendrite initiation of several classes of solid electrolytes is discussed.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society

Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.With higher nature abundance and lower production cost of sodium-based materials compared to lithium-based ones, sodium batteries have been arising as one of the most promising energy storage systems serving as complementary power sources to the popular lithium-ion batteries. Replacing conventional liquid electrolytes containing flammable liquid solvents with polymer electrolytes (PEs) empowers sodium batteries with inherently enhanced safety at a low expense of processability. In this contribution, we present a comprehensive overview on the research progresses and advances in the PE-based sodium batteries, including three main categories of PEs, i.e., solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), composite solid polymer electrolytes (CSPEs), and plasticized/gel polymer electrolytes (PPEs/GPEs). The energy densities of sodium batteries at cell level are estimated and compared with their lithium counterparts. The research development of PE-based sodium batteries is scrutinized and the remaining challenges and possible solutions are intensively discussed. The purpose of the present work is not only to provide a well-balanced status quo of PE-based sodium batteries but also to address the possible remedies for improving their performance and other post lithium battery technologies, in hope of facilitating their large-scale deployment in the market.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society

In Situ Formation of Liquid Metals via Galvanic Replacement Reaction to Build Dendrite-Free Alkali-Metal-Ion Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Galvanic replacement reactions have been studied as a versatile route to synthesize nanostructured alloys. However, the galvanic replacement chemistry of alkali metals has rarely been explored. A protective interphase layer will be formed outside templates when the redox potential exceeds the potential windows of nonaqueous solutions, and the complex interfacial chemistry remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the formation of room-temperature liquid metal alloys of Na and K via galvanic replacement reaction. The fundamentals of the reaction at such low potentials are investigated via a combined experimental and computational method, which uncovers the critical role of solid-electrolyte interphase in regulating the migration of Na ions and thus the alloying reaction kinetics. With in situ formed NaK liquid alloys as an anode, the dendritic growth of alkali metals can be eliminated thanks to the deformable and self-healing features of liquid metals. The proof-of-concept battery delivers reasonable electrochemical performance, confirming the generality of this in situ approach and design principle for next-generation dendrite-free batteries.",Advanced Materials

The extensive applications of various SACs are manifested via their ability to electro-catalyze typical hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and conversion reactions in novel room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries (RT-Na-S). The enhanced performances for these electrochemical reactions arisen from the ability of different single active atoms on local structures to tune their electronic configuration. Significantly, the electrocatalytic behaviors of diverse SACs, assisted by density functional theory calculations, are systematically revealed by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and in situ transmission electronic microscopy, providing a strategic library for the general synthesis and extensive applications of SACs in energy conversion and storage.",Advanced Materials

Superior anchoring effect of a Cu-benzenehexathial MOF as an aluminium-sulfur battery cathode host,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The poor reversibility and short lifespan of next generation Al-S batteries can be effectively overcome by opting for a cathode host able to trap sulfur and Al polysulfide species. In this work, with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a 2D Cu-benzenehexathial (Cu-BHT) metal organic framework (MOF) has been proposed as an excellent potential cathode host for Al-S batteries as compared to carbonaceous hosts such as graphene. The favourable electrical conductivity of the Cu-BHT MOF eliminates the insulating nature of most sulfur-based electrodes and is helpful in supporting the cathode charge/discharge processes. The results of a binding study show that while graphene has low binding energies (-0.76 to -0.88 eV) towards Al polysulfides, the Cu-BHT MOF exhibits improved binding to Al polysulfides (-1.11 to -3.56 eV) because of the presence of copper and sulfur, which results in increased charge transfer to the Al polysulfides. The synergic dual interactions based on the Al-S (of the sulfur host) bond and S (of the Al polysulfide)-Cu bond also lead to a uniform deposition of insoluble Al2S3 over the Cu-BHT surface, improving the utilization of the active cathode host. This leads to the incorporation of 45.81 wt% sulfur in the Cu-BHT monolayer host, higher than that of the experimentally reported S@HKUST-1-C cathode host (34 wt%) for Al-S batteries. Moreover, it is also observed that the Al polysulfide binding is much stronger than their interaction with the electrolytes, thus decreasing the overall dissolution of Al polysulfides into the electrolyte and improving the net cycling performance in Al-S batteries. With these desirable properties, it is expected that the Cu-BHT MOF can be used as a promising anchoring cathode host compared to graphene in Al-S batteries. This journal is",Materials Advances
A review on recent approaches for designing the SEI layer on sodium metal anodes,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.With the ever-increasing demand for high energy density and low-cost energy storage devices, researchers have revitalized the field of alkali metal batteries. One of the emerging candidates are the sodium metal batteries (SMBs) as they have the merits of high theoretical capacity (1166 mA h g-1) and can be easily manufactured owing to the abundance of sodium resources. However, the uncontrollable dendrite growth on sodium metal, mainly attributed to its inhomogeneous and unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), has severely hindered the practical application of SMBs. In this review, we first summarize the critical challenges faced in the practical application of SMBs based on fundamental studies. We then discuss the recent approaches for designing an SEI layer on sodium metal anodes from two perspectives combined with feasible ideas, i.e., electrolyte modification and artificial interphase engineering. Finally, the practical applications and prospects of SMBs based on the fundamental knowledge and characterization methods are provided. We anticipate that our review will provide essential insights on stable SEI layer formation and also contribute to innovative ideas for developing practical SMBs. This journal is",Materials Advances
Direct Intermediate Regulation Enabled by Sulfur Containers in Working Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Polysulfide intermediates (PSs), the liquid-phase species of active materials in lithium–sulfur (Li-S) batteries, connect the electrochemical reactions between insulative solid sulfur and lithium sulfide and are key to full exertion of the high-energy-density Li-S system. Herein, the concept of sulfur container additives is proposed for the direct modification on the PSs species. By reversible storage and release of the sulfur species, the container molecule converts small PSs into large organosulfur species. The prototype di(tri)sulfide-polyethylene glycol sulfur container is highly efficient in the reversible PS transformation to multiply affect electrochemical behaviors of sulfur cathodes in terms of liquid-species clustering, reaction kinetics, and solid deposition. The stability and capacity of Li-S cells was thereby enhanced. The sulfur container is a strategy to directly modify PSs, enlightening the precise regulation on Li-S batteries and multi-phase electrochemical systems.",Advanced Materials

Recent advancements in high-performance solid electrolytes for li-ion batteries: Towards a solid future,"© 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.With the emergence of non-conventional energy resources and development of energy storage devices, serious efforts on lithium (Li) based rechargeable solid electrolyte batteries (Li-SEBs) are attaining momentum due to their potential as a safe candidate to replace state-of-the-art conventionally existing flammable organic liquid electrolyte-based Li-ion batteries (LIBs). However, Li-ion conduction in solid electrolytes (SEs) has been one of the major bottlenecks in large scale commercialization of next-generation Li-SEBs.

Chalcogenide electrolytes for all-solid-state sodium ion batteries,"© Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.All-solid-state sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) are important for future large-scale energy storage applications. ASIBs have come to occupy an important position in research on advanced secondary batteries in recent years owing to their advantages of abundance in resources, low cost, long lifetime, and high safety. As the key to the success of ASIBs, solid-state electrolytes such as polymers, oxide ceramics, and sulfide glass-ceramics have always attracted immense interest. Chalcogenide electrolytes for ASIBs have high roomtemperature conductivity, high elastic modulus, and can be easily pressed into a mold at room temperature; hence, they are the research focus in ASIBs. This paper summarized recent studies on the structure and properties of chalcogenide electrolytes for ASIBs. These studies demonstrate the relationship between the phase structure and ionic conductivity of sulfide-based electrolytes and selenide-based electrolytes. Besides, arguments that the sodium vacancy in the crystal structure dominates ionic conduction, and creating a sodium vacancy via cation substitution is the principal strategy to increasing ionic conduction, are discussed. Further, the intrinsic chemical stability and interface stability between the electrode and electrolyte are highlighted. Based on the soft and hard acid and base theory, some studies adopted various anion/cation ion substitution strategies to improve the chemical stability of chalcogenide electrolytes in humid air. Particularly, the inconsistency in the electrochemical stability window of a representative chalcogenide electrode, Na3PS4, as measured by a semi-blocking electrode and calculated by firstprinciples, is compared. Additionally, to develop all-solid-state Na-S and Na-O2 batteries with high capacity, the nonnegligible interface instability of the sulfide electrode against the sodium metal anode and feasible solutions are summarized. Next, the research progress on ASIBs using chalcogenide electrolytes is reviewed. Chalcogenide electrolytes are restricted by the electrochemical stability window and chemical compatibility with electrode materials; hence, they are expected to only be applicable to ASIBs using sulfur, sulfide, and organic matter as the cathode and Na-Sn alloy as the anode. However, these ASIBs have long cycling life (> 500 cycles), illustrating their potential applications in large-scale energy storage power stations. Finally, we comprehensively evaluate the ionic conductivity, stability against humid air, stability of the interface, electrochemical stability window, and ease of preparation of typical chalcogenide electrolytes, including Na3PS4, Na3PSe4, Na3SbS4, Na3SbSe4, Na10SnPS12, and Na11Sn2PS12. Moreover, we highlight the challenges and propose possible solutions toward the development of chalcogenide electrolytes in future. Advanced technologies in fine synthesis, in situ characterization, and surface/interface modification are essential to overcome existing challenges and promote the development of chalcogenide-electrolyte-based ASIBs.",Wuli Huaxue Xuebao/ Acta Physico - Chimica Sinica
Electrocatalytic assisted performance enhancement for the Na-S battery in nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres loaded with Fe,"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries have been considered to be potential candidates for future energy storage devices because of their low cost, abundance, and high performance. The sluggish sulfur reaction and the “shuttle effect” are among the main problems that hinder the commercial utilization of room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. In this study, the performance of a hybrid that was based on nitrogen (N)-doped carbon nanospheres loaded with a meagre amount of Fe ions (0.14 at.%) was investigated in the sodium-sulfur battery. The Fe ions accelerated the conversion of polysulfides and provided a stronger interaction with soluble polysulfides. The Fe-carbon nanospheres hybrid delivered a reversible capacity of 359 mAh·g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A·g−1 and retained a capacity of 180 mAh·g−1 at 1 A·g−1, after 200 cycles. These results, combined with the excellent rate performance, suggest that Fe ions, even at low loading, are able to improve the electrocatalytic effect of carbon nanostructures significantly. In addition to Na-S batteries, the new hybrid is anticipated to be a strong candidate for other energy storage and conversion applications such as other metal-sulfur batteries and metal-air batteries.",Molecules
Beyond lithium-based batteries,"© 2020 by the authors.We discuss the latest developments in alternative battery systems based on sodium, magnesium, zinc and aluminum. In each case, we categorize the individual metals by the overarching cathode material type, focusing on the energy storage mechanism. Specifically, sodium-ion batteries are the closest in technology and chemistry to today's lithium-ion batteries. This lowers the technology transition barrier in the short term, but their low specific capacity creates a long-term problem. The lower reactivity of magnesium makes pure Mg metal anodes much safer than alkali ones. However, these are still reactive enough to be deactivated over time. Alloying magnesium with different metals can solve this problem. Combining this with different cathodes gives good specific capacities, but with a lower voltage (<1.3 V, compared with 3.8 V for Li-ion batteries). Zinc has the lowest theoretical specific capacity, but zinc metal anodes are so stable that they can be used without alterations. This results in comparable capacities to the other materials and can be immediately used in systems where weight is not a problem. Theoretically, aluminum is the most promising alternative, with its high specific capacity thanks to its three-electron redox reaction. However, the trade-off between stability and specific capacity is a problem. After analyzing each option separately, we compare them all via a political, economic, socio-cultural and technological (PEST) analysis. The review concludes with recommendations for future applications in the mobile and stationary power sectors.",Materials
Complex hollow structures of cobalt(II) sulfide as a cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2020 The Authors.Lithium-sulfur batteries are considered the most promising candidates in the next generation of electrochemical energy storage because of their huge advantages in energy density, coulombic efficiency and price. One of the problems to be solved is promoting the conversion of polysulfides while maintaining high sulfur utilization. Complex double-layered hollow nanostructures have attracted wide attention as battery cathode materials. A ZIF-67 nanocube is used as a template to form a double-layer hollow structure (denoted as CoS) in which the inner layer is a CoS nanobox and the outer shell is a CoS nanosheet. In general, the double-layer hollow structure not only maximizes the encapsulation of sulfur but also provides sufficient reaction sites to optimize the electrochemical properties of the material. As a cathode material for Li-S batteries, cobalt-based sulfides also improve electrochemical performance due to their high electronic conductivity and abundance of redox reaction sites. The initial discharge capacity of the battery at 0.1 C was 1275.76 mA h g-1, demonstrating excellent rate performance.",International Journal of Electrochemical Science
Solvent-dictated sodium sulfur redox reactions: Investigation of carbonate and ether electrolytes,"© 2020 by the authors.Sulfur-based cathode chemistries are essential for the development of high energy density alkali-ion batteries. Here, we elucidate the redox kinetics of sulfur confined on carbon nanotubes, comparing its performance in ether-based and carbonate-based electrolytes at room temperature. The solvent is found to play a key role for the electrochemical reactivity of the sulfur cathode in sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries. Ether-based electrolytes contribute to a more complete reduction of sulfur and enable a higher electrochemical reversibility. On the other hand, an irreversible solution-phase reaction is observed in carbonate solvents. This study clearly reveals the solvent-dependent Na-S reaction pathways in room temperature Na-S batteries and provides an insight into realizing their high energy potential, via electrolyte formulation design.",Energies
Large-scale surfactant-free synthesis of WS2 nanosheets: An investigation into the detailed reaction chemistry of colloidal precipitation and their application as an anode material for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are versatile 2D materials that have many important applications including their use as battery materials for energy storage. However, very few reports are available in the open literature on the scalable synthesis of these materials. In this work, an easy and versatile wet synthesis method for large scale preparation of tungsten disulfide (WS2) is reported. Although such methods are sometimes referred to in textbooks as the 'industrial methods' for WS2 manufacturing, a detailed synthesis process is not reported in the literature. The chemistry of the process, as revealed in this work, is also very different from that hitherto known. In this work, we clearly show that the sulfurization of WO42- is found to occur through several stable intermediates such as WOS32- and WO2S22-. Sulfurization is also found to occur through H2S upon lowering the pH. The entire process needs very careful monitoring as various side reactions and the corresponding pH are identified during the sulfurization process, which is crucial for product purity and yield. Apart from the sulfurization process, we also thoroughly explored the calcination step and hence have provided a complete process for obtaining the best pristine quality, scalable WS2 sheets. When evaluated as an anode material for Li-ion (LIB) and Na-ion (NIB) batteries, an initial capacity of about 400 mA h g-1 at 1C rate is obtained. A drastic capacity fading due to polysulphide formation is found to be more critical in the NIB system. The rate capability of pristine, bulk, scalable WS2 in LIBs is quite high (250 mA h g-1) even at 5C rate (2.1 A g-1). The initial results on carbon-coated WS2/C as the anode in LIBs show remarkable capacity recovery and retention, regaining the initial reversible capacity of about 450 mA h g-1 after 700 cycles at 1C.",New Journal of Chemistry
Utilizing Cyclic Voltammetry to Understand the Energy Storage Mechanisms for Copper Oxide and its Graphene Oxide Hybrids as Lithium-Ion Battery Anodes,"© 2020 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.Graphene-based materials have been extensively researched as a means improve the electrochemical performance of transition metal oxides in Li-ion battery applications, however an understanding of the effect of the different synthesis routes, and the factors underlying the oft-stated better performance of the hybrid materials (compared to the pure metal oxides) is not always demonstrated. For the first time, we report a range of synthetic routes to produce graphene oxide (GO)-coated CuO, micro-particle/GO “bundles” as well as nano-particulates decorated on GO sheets to enable a comparison with CuO and its carbon-coated analogue, as confirmed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging and Raman spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry was utilized to probe the lithiation/delithiation mechanism of CuO by scanning at successively decreasing vertex potentials, uncovering the importance of a full reduction to Cu metal on the reduction step. The GO hybrid materials clearly show enhanced specific capacities and cycling stabilities comparative to the CuO, with the most promising material achieving a capacity of 746 mAh g−1 and capacity retention of 92 % after 30 cycles, which is the highest stable capacity quoted in literature for CuO. The simple cyclic voltammetry technique used in this work could be implemented to help further understand any conversion-type anode materials, in turn accelerating the research and industrial development of conversion anodes.",ChemSusChem
Electrochemical: In situ construction of vanadium oxide heterostructures with boosted pseudocapacitive charge storage,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Pseudocapacitive materials hold extraordinary promise for improving the energy densities of electrochemical capacitors but are often limited to electrodes with ultralow mass loadings (e.g. <1 mg cm-2) due to the sluggish mass transport kinetics in thicker electrodes. Here a V5O12/VO2 heterojunction nanomaterial with a built-in electric field near the heterointerface is fabricated on a 3D graphite substrate via an in situ electrochemical method for the first time, which can remarkably enhance the capacitive performance by improving the electron/ion delivery kinetics. The V5O12/VO2 electrode (mass loading ∼10.8 mg cm-2) achieves a high areal capacitance of 5.03 F cm-2 (465 F g-1) with a good rate capability and long cycle life, outperforming the V5O12 and VO2 counterparts, as well as the state-of-the-art reported VOX electrodes. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled using V5O12/VO2 as the negative electrode and MnO2 as the positive electrode can deliver high areal/volumetric energy densities of 1.42 mW h cm-2/11.85 mW h cm-3. An extrapolated gravimetric energy density of 18.6 W h kg-1 can also be achieved, based on the entire weight of the device (76.6 mg cm-2, active material ratio ∼30%), representing a critical step of pushing pseudocapacitors toward practical applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Dual-phase MoS2 as a high-performance sodium-ion battery anode,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.The increasing cost and limited availability of lithium have prompted the development of high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as a potential alternative to lithium-ion batteries. However, it has been a critical challenge to develop high-performance anode materials capable of storing and transporting Na+ efficiently. Amongst the various options, MoS2 has significant advantages including low cost, and a high theoretical capacity of ∼670 mA h g-1. Nevertheless, MoS2 has several issues: its electronic conductivity is low and its structure deteriorates rapidly during charge/discharge cycles, leading to a poor electrochemical performance. Here, a dual-phase MoS2 (DP-MoS2) is synthesized by combining two distinct 1T (trigonal) and 2H (hexagonal) phases to solve these challenges. Compared to the conventional 2H-MoS2 counterpart, the DP-MoS2 phase material presents a highly reversible Na+ intercalation/extraction process aided by expanded interlayer spacing along with much higher electronic conductivity and Na ion affinity. Consequently, the DP-MoS2 electrode delivers a high cyclic stability with a reversible capacity of 300 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 and an excellent rate capability of ∼220 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1. The SIBs assembled with DP-MoS2 and Na3V2(PO4)3 as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively, have a specific capacity of 210 mA h g-1 (based on the mass of DP-MoS2) at 0.5 A g-1. This performance demonstrates that DP-MoS2 has a significant potential in commercial devices. This work offers a new approach to develop metal chalcogenides for electrochemical energy storage applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Recent advances in phosphate cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries,"© Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.Lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles because of their high energy density and long cycle life. Sodium-ion batteries have broad application prospects in the areas of large-scale electrochemical energy storage systems and low-speed electric vehicles because of their abundant raw materials, low resource cost, safety, and environmental friendliness. However, the development of sodium-ion batteries has been hindered by the low reversibility, sluggish ion diffusion, and large volume variations of the host materials. Suitable electrode materials with decent electrochemical performance must be primarily explored for the successful use of sodium-ion batteries. Since the electrochemical potential and specific capacities of cathode materials have a major impact on the energy densities of sodium-ion batteries, the development of cathode materials is critical. To date, various Na-insertable frameworks have been proposed, and some cathode materials have been reported to deliver reversible capacities approaching their theoretical values. Among them, transition metal oxides show a high reversible capacity and high working potential, but most of them still possess problems such as irreversible phase transition, air instability, and insufficient battery performance. Another type is the Prussian blue analogs. These materials exhibit a favorable operating voltage, cycling stability, and rate capability; however, the main obstacles to their practical application are the control of lattice defects, thermal instability, and low tap density. Polyanionic phosphates are the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries and have great research value and application prospects because of their stable framework structure, suitable operating voltage, and fast ion diffusion channels. However, their inherent defects, such as poor electronic conductivity and low theoretical energy density, considerably limit their practical applications. Researchers have conducted modification studies through bulk structure adjustment and micro-nano structural control with the goal of improving the performance of phosphate cathode materials and promoting the research and development of sodium-ion energy storage systems. This study reviews the recent advances in phosphate cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, including orthophosphates, pyrophosphates, fluorophosphates, and mixed phosphate compounds. In this study, the intrinsic relationships among material composition, structure, and electrochemical properties are identified through analyses of the crystal structures, sodium storage mechanisms, and modification strategies of phosphate materials, thereby providing a reference for the continuous modification of polyanion phosphate cathode materials and exploration of high-voltage phosphate cathode materials. Some directions for future research and possible strategies for building advanced sodium-ion batteries are also proposed.",Wuli Huaxue Xuebao/ Acta Physico - Chimica Sinica
High loading FeS2 nanoparticles anchored on biomass-derived carbon tube as low cost and long cycle anode for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2019 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of SciencesIn recent years, the sodium storage mechanism and performance optimization of FeS2 have been studied intensively. However, before the commercial application of FeS2, preconditions of low-cost, simple craft and scale production of nanoscale FeS2 are also essential. Based on above challenges, mesh-like FeS2/carbon tube/FeS2 composites are prepared simply from green, low-cost and renewable natural herb in this work. With the assistance of protogenetic interconnected carbon tube network (only 5.3 wt%), FeS2/carbon tube/FeS2 composites show high capacity (542.2 mA h g−1), good stability (< 0.005% per cycle over 1000 cycles), and excellent rate performance (426.2 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1). The outstanding electrochemical performance of FeS2/carbon tube/FeS2 composites may be attributed to the unique interconnected reticular structure, meaning that FeS2 nanoparticles are effectively immobilized by carbon tube network via physical encapsulation and chemical bonding. More importantly, this work may provide green and low cost preparation method for specially structured metal sulfides/carbon composites, which promotes their commercial utilization in environmentally friendly energy storage system.",Green Energy and Environment
Enhanced Chemisorption and Catalytic Effects toward Polysulfides by Modulating Hollow Nanoarchitectures for Long-Life Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimHollow nanostructures with intricate interior and catalytic effects hold great promise for the construction of advanced lithium–sulfur batteries. Herein, a double-shelled hollow polyhedron with inlaid cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated by nitrogen-doped carbon (Co/NC) nanodots (Co-NC@Co9S8/NPC) is reported, which is acquired by using imidazolium-based ionic-polymer-encapsulated zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 as a core-shelled precursor. The Co/NC nanodots promote redox kinetics and chemical adsorbability toward polysulfides, while the interconnected double shells serve as a nanoscale electrochemical reaction chamber, which effectively suppresses the polysulfide shuttling and accelerates ion/electron transport. Benefiting from structural engineering and reaction kinetics modulation, the Co-NC@Co9S8/NPC-S electrode exhibits high cycling stability with a low capacity decay of 0.011% per cycle within 2000 cycles at 2 C. The electrode still shows high rate performance and cyclability over 500 cycles even in the case of high sulfur loading of 4.5 mg cm−2 and 75 wt% sulfur content. This work provides one type of new hollow nanoarchitecture for the development of advanced Li–S batteries and other energy storage systems.",Small
Fully Conjugated Phthalocyanine Copper Metal–Organic Frameworks for Sodium–Iodine Batteries with Long-Time-Cycling Durability,"© 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRechargeable sodium–iodine (Na–I2) batteries are attracting growing attention for grid-scale energy storage due to their abundant resources, low cost, environmental friendliness, high theoretical capacity (211 mAh g−1), and excellent electrochemical reversibility. Nevertheless, the practical application of Na–I2 batteries is severely hindered by their poor cycle stability owing to the serious dissolution of polyiodide in the electrolyte during charge/discharge processes. Herein, the atomic modulation of metal–bis(dihydroxy) species in a fully conjugated phthalocyanine copper metal–organic framework (MOF) for suppression of polyiodide dissolution toward long-time cycling Na–I2 batteries is demonstrated. The Fe2[(2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octahydroxy phthalocyaninato)Cu] MOF composited with I2 (Fe2–O8–PcCu/I2) serves as a cathode for a Na–I2 battery exhibiting a stable specific capacity of 150 mAh g−1 after 3200 cycles and outperforming the state-of-the-art cathodes for Na–I2 batteries. Operando spectroelectrochemical and electrochemical kinetics analyses together with density functional theory calculations reveal that the square planar iron–bis(dihydroxy) (Fe–O4) species in Fe2–O8–PcCu are responsible for the binding of polyiodide to restrain its dissolution into electrolyte. Besides the monovalent Na–I2 batteries in organic electrolytes, the Fe2–O8–PcCu/I2 cathode also operates stably in other metal–I2 batteries like aqueous multivalent Zn–I2 batteries. Thus, this work offers a new strategy for designing stable cathode materials toward high-performance metal–iodine batteries.",Advanced Materials
Solid-solution alloy nanoclusters of the immiscible gold-rhodium system achieved by a solid ligand-assisted approach for highly efficient catalysis,"© 2019, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Striking effects are expected in solid-solution alloying, which offers enormous possibilities for various applications, especially in industrial catalysis. However, phase diagrams have revealed that a wide range of metallic elements are immiscible with each other even above their melting points. Achieving such unknown alloying between different immiscible metallic elements is highly desirable but challenging. Here, for the first time, by using an innovative solid ligand-assisted approach, we achieve the solid-solution alloying between the bulk-immiscible Au and Rh in plenty of clean, ultrafine (∼ 1.6 nm) and highly dispersed nanoclusters. The solid-solution alloying of immiscible Au and Rh significantly enhances their catalytic performance toward the hydrogen evolution from formic acid in contrast to the monometallic Au and Rh nanoclusters. Moreover, the resultant binary solid-solution nanoclusters are stable without any segregation during catalytic reactions. The approach demonstrated here for homogeneously mixing the immiscible metals at the atomic scale will benefit the creation of advanced alloys and their catalytic applications in future.

KGaA, WeinheimAll-solid-state batteries with an alkali metal anode have the potential to achieve high energy density. However, the onset of dendrite formation limits the maximum plating current density across the solid electrolyte and prevents fast charging. It is shown that the maximum plating current density is related to the interfacial resistance between the solid electrolyte and the metal anode. Due to their high ionic conductivity, low electronic conductivity, and stability against sodium metal, Na-β″-alumina ceramics are excellent candidates as electrolytes for room-temperature all-solid-state batteries. Here, it is demonstrated that a heat treatment of Na-β″-alumina ceramics in argon atmosphere enables an interfacial resistance <10 Ω cm2 and current densities up to 12 mA cm−2 at room temperature. The current density obtained for Na-β″-alumina is ten times higher than that measured on a garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 electrolyte under equivalent conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that eliminating hydroxyl groups and carbon contaminations at the interface between Na-β″-alumina and sodium metal is key to reach such values. By comparing the temperature-dependent stripping/plating behavior of Na-β″-alumina and Li7La3Zr2O12, the role of the alkali metal in governing interface kinetics is discussed. This study provides new insights into dendrite formation and paves the way for fast-charging all-solid-state batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials
All roads lead to Rome: Sodiation of different-stacked SnS2,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdStructural symmetry variations of two-dimensional materials may significantly affect their reaction process and kinetics with alkali ions. Here, SnS2 with different structural symmetry is used as the target to be comparatively investigated the phase transition pathway and ionic diffusion upon (de)sodiation in sodium-ion batteries using in situ transmission electron microscopy and ex situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in combination with first-principles calculations. Different intermediate phases, AA1 NaSnS2 for trigonal SnS2 and AB1 NaSnS2 for hexagonal SnS2, are observed after sodium ions fully occupy all Oh sites. While the coming conversion/alloying reaction processes are relatively similar. The AA1/AB1 NaSnS2 sequentially transits to SnS, β-Sn and Na15Sn4 phases starting from Td sites of SnS2 being held. Reversible reactions occur among SnS, Na15Sn4 and Na2Sm (2<m<8) in following cycles. Our works provide a deep understanding of the ionic diffusion and electrochemical reaction mechanisms for two-dimensional materials with different symmetry, and offer some guidance for the design of the high energy two-dimensional electrode materials.",Nano Energy
MXene-Based Dendrite-Free Potassium Metal Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimPotassium metal batteries are considered as attractive alternatives beyond lithium-ion batteries. However, uncontrollable dendrite growth on the potassium metal anode has restrained their practical applications. A high-performance potassium anode achieved by confining potassium metal into a titanium-deficient nitrogen-containing MXene/carbon nanotube freestanding scaffold is reported. The high electronic transport and fast potassium diffusion in this scaffold enable reduced local current density and homogeneous ionic flux during plating/stripping processes. Furthermore, as verified by theoretical calculations and experimental investigations, such “potassium-philic” MXene sheets can induce the nucleation of potassium, and guide potassium to uniformly distribute in the scaffold upon cycling. Consequently, the as-developed potassium metal anodes exhibit a dendrite-free morphology with high Coulombic efficiency and long cycle life during plating/stripping processes. Such anodes also deliver significantly improved electrochemical performances in potassium–sulfur batteries compared with bare potassium metal anodes. This work can provide a new avenue for developing potassium metal-based batteries.",Advanced Materials
Revealing the Critical Factor in Metal Sulfide Anode Performance in Sodium-Ion Batteries: An Investigation of Polysulfide Shuttling Issues,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimMetal sulfides are a class of promising anodes for sodium-ion batteries with high theoretical capacities. However, the properties of intrinsic metal sulfide anodes usually decay rapidly at initial cycling of batteries. Previously, it was believed that the low conductivity and volume expansion of metal sulfides lead to the poor performance. Here, using in situ batteries followed by the assistance of spectral analysis, it is shown that the polysulfide shuttling effect is one of the crucial factors for the degradation of metal sulfide anodes beyond traditional consensus of low conductivity and volume expansion. Furthermore, a novel strategy by controlling the dissolution of sodium polysulfides in selected electrolyte is proposed to enable intrinsic metal sulfides to work stably in polysulfide-insoluble fluoroethylene carbonate electrolyte, which would decay fast in polysulfide-soluble propylene carbonate electrolyte. This work has deepened the understanding of electrochemical reaction mechanisms of metal sulfide anodes and expanded the strategies to optimize the electrochemical performance of metal sulfides anodes.",Small Methods
Controlling the physical and electrochemical properties of block copolymer-based porous carbon fibers by pyrolysis temperature,"© 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Block copolymer-based porous carbon fibers are emerging materials for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Pyrolysis temperature governs the properties of carbons. To design porous carbon fibers with tunable pore size, surface area, heteroatom content, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical performance, block copolymer poly(acrylonitrile-block-methyl methacrylate) (PAN-b-PMMA) was converted to porous carbon fibers via self-assembly, stabilization, and pyrolysis at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1200 °C. An increase in the pyrolysis temperature increases the total pore volume, specific surface area, and graphitic level, but decreases the amounts of nitrogen and oxygen heteroatoms, as well as the electrical resistance. As electrochemical supercapacitor electrodes, the porous carbon fibers pyrolyzed at 800 °C exhibit the highest gravimetric capacitance, owing to the balanced structural, chemical, and physical properties. The porous carbon fibers pyrolyzed at 600 °C have the highest heteroatom content to induce pseudocapacitance, but their capacitance and rate capability are the lowest due to the poorest electrical conductivity. In contrast, the porous carbon fibers pyrolyzed at 1200 °C show the best rate capability because of the highest electrical conductivity, the largest pore volume, the lowest diffusion resistance, and the best electron/ion transport. This work systematically reveals the thermal processing principles of porous carbon fibers with controlled structural, physical and electrochemical properties. The findings provide a guideline for designing block copolymer-based porous carbon fibers for electrochemical energy conversion and storage.",Molecular Systems Design and Engineering
Electron density modulation of Fe1-xCoxP nanosheet arrays by iron incorporation for highly efficient water splitting,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdThe good performance of base metal phosphides as alternative catalysts for hydrogen evolution has attracted great attention. However, phosphorus-hydrogen bonds (P-Hads) are easily formed on the surface of metal phosphides, which will severely inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we propose a universal strategy to improve the HER activity of metal phosphides by modulating the surface electron densities. The iron modulated Fe0.29Co0.71P nanosheet arrays exhibit an overpotential of 74 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 53.56 mV dec−1, which are close to the performance of noble metal catalysts in alkaline condition. The electronic interactions between cobalt and phosphorus are modulated after iron doping, resulting in more positively charged Co, which can promote adsorption and activation of H2O molecules and will weaken P-Hads bonds formed on the catalyst surfaces. Therefore, Fe0.29Co0.71P can optimize the adsorption and desorption of H atoms, and can promote both Volmer and Heyrovsky steps of HER. In addition, the electron density modulation of catalytic sites also improves the OER catalytic performance of Fe0.29Co0.71P. The overall water splitting electrolyzer assembled by Fe0.29Co0.71P/Ni-foam exhibits a lower cell voltage (1.59 V/10 mA cm−2), compared to that (1.61 V/10 mA cm−2) of the IrO2//Pt/C electrolyzer.",Nano Energy
Facile Synthesis of Copper Sulfide Nanosheet@Graphene Oxide for the Anode of Potassium-Ion Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimPotassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are promising to expedite future energy storage progress because of the low price and high energy density of potassium. Copper sulfide (CuS), a plentiful, low-priced, and nontoxic transition metal sulfide, is going to be a promising anode material with high capacity and excellent rate performance for energy storage. Herein, thioacetamide is chosen as the sulfur source to prepare CuS nanosheets uniformly anchored on graphene oxide (CuS@GO) using a simple one-step method. The prepared CuS@GO increases the active sites and GO effectively alleviates the polymerization of CuS during the cycling. When CuS@GO is utilized as an anode material for PIBs, it exhibits a preeminent specific capacity of 410 mAh g−1 (at a current density of 100 mA g−1) and outstanding rate capability (even achieving a higher capacity of 196.5 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1000 mA g−1). In this study, the phase evolution of CuS during the potassium-ion insertion and extraction process is further explored by in situ X-ray diffraction studies, which is significant to clearly understand the energy storage mechanism of CuS. A novel perspective in potassium storage mechanism for transition metal sulfides is provided.",Energy Technology
"Structural, optical and electrochemical performances of undoped and Sn2+-doped Bi2Te3 nanoparticles on WO3 electrodes","© 2019 Elsevier LtdA facile synthesis approach was used to prepare Sn2+-doped Bi2Te3 nanospheres on a WO3 electrode, and the pseudo-capacitive property was measured for samples prepared with optimum parameters. SEM micrographs revealed that after the Sn2+ doping, the morphology of Bi2Te3 changed from aggregated or network-like nanoparticles to smaller nanospheres with a homogeneous distribution. The X-ray diffraction pattern showed rhombohedral Bi2Te3 coated on the WO3 electrode. Due to the more abundant electro-active sites and charge carriers that diffused through the electrolyte to the working electrode, the Sn2+-doped Bi2Te3 electrode displayed the highest specific capacity of 41.4 mAh/g at a scan rate 10 mV/s, a power density of 0.63 kW/kg, an energy density of 24.5 Wh/kg, and an LSV breakdown potential of 0.26 V. These materials may be applied in potential pseudo-capacitors and in further energy storage devices.",Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing
Structural environment of chloride ion-conducting solids based on lanthanum oxychloride,"© 2019 The American Ceramic SocietyThe effect of the structural environment on the Cl− ion conductivity was demonstrated in LaOCl-based solid electrolytes. By replacing the La3+ site with lower-valent Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, the conductivity was enhanced owing to the formation of a Cl− ion vacancy. Despite the same dopant content, the conductivity of La0.8Ca0.2OCl0.8 was considerably greater than La0.8Mg0.2OCl0.8. This enhancement of the conductivity was influenced by the high ionicity of the Cl− ions, which facilitated the weakening of the La-Cl bond cleavage to conduct inside the lattice. The elongation of the La-La distance, associated with the Cl− ion conduction, could also cause an increase of the conductivity.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society
A Game Changer: Functional Nano/Micromaterials for Smart Rechargeable Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe imperative to electrify the transport sector in the past few decades has put millions of electric vehicles on the road worldwide with an extended mile range from critical technological breakthroughs in developing the rechargeable energy storage systems, which also covers electronic devices and smart grid applications. However, the available energy density of prevailing systems in the market (i.e., batteries) is reaching its boundaries due to the limited choice of electrochemical reactions that necessarily depend on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the components (e.g., cathode, anode, electrolyte, separator, and current collectors). Reaching the high energy density of batteries exploits new redox chemistry such as sensitive metal anodes, insulating and highly dissolving sulfur cathodes, etc., thus requiring novel designs of various multiscale functional materials to address the corresponding issues. Here, the recent achievements on the designs of smart functional materials for emerging problems in the whole range of systems are discussed: i) interfacial control/kinetic regulation of Li–S battery; ii) self-healing-driven structural stability in the electrode and electrolyte; iii) ion-sieving functional membranes for selective scavenging capability; and iv) functional materials to ensure battery safety.",Advanced Functional Materials
Rational construction of rGO/VO2 nanoflowers as sulfur multifunctional hosts for room temperature Na-S batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Developing high energy density room-temperature sodium sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries relies on the design of delicate structure that can be efficiently injected sulfur and enhance the cycle life of electrode active material. Herein, a three dimensional (3D) hierarchical cathode substrate with VO2 nanoflowers as catalyst in situ grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for sulfur cathodes are designed and prepared. In this novel structure, the electronic conductivity of sulfur cathode can be greatly improved due to the high electrical conductivity of rGO substrate. More importantly, the catalytic effect of VO2 accelerates the conversion long-chain NaPSs to Na2S2/Na2S, and enhances the cycle capability, which can be validated by experimental data. As a result, the as-obtained rGO/VO2/S composites achieves an initial reversible capacity of 876.4 mA h g−1 at 0.2C. Moreover, the capacity of 156.1 mA h g−1 is demonstrated after long-cycling term of 1000 cycles at 2C and high cycle stability of only 0.07% capacity decay per cycle is exhibited.",Chemical Engineering Journal

This review summarizes the fundamental understandings on the interfacial behaviors between liquid electrolytes, electrodes and solid-state electrolytes. Afterwards, emerging strategies are discussed, involving interfacial wetting, in situ polymerization and interfacial reactions. Finally, current limitations and perspectives are presented for liquid phase therapy regarding the interfacial science and engineering.",Energy Storage Materials
Progress on iron oxides and chalcogenides as anodes for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.As one of the most promising candidate devices in large-scale energy storage applications for renewable energy, sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted great attention due to the inexpensive cost and abundant sodium sources in earth's crust. To exert the cost advantage for NIBs, earth-abundant electrode materials are essential. Recent studies have demonstrated that various iron-based materials, such as iron oxides and chalcogenides can be regarded as potential anode candidates for NIBs. In this review, recent progress on iron-based materials as anodes for NIBs is summarized. The corresponding structural designs, achievable capacities and electrochemical mechanisms are also briefly discussed. Based on this extensive literature review, there are still some existing challenges for these anode materials. In addition, outlooks on the possible further research directions are presented.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Poly(vinylidene difluoride) coating on Cu current collector for high-performance Na metal anode,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Direct utilization of Na metal anode, instead of carbon or alloy-based anode, is highly desired in Na-ion batteries mainly because of its lowest operating potential and high capacity. Nevertheless, unstable solid electrolyte interphase and uncontrollable Na dendrite growth during the repetitive Na deposition/stripping process usually lead to the low Coulombic efficiency and safety hazards. Herein, dendrite-free Na deposition/stripping can be achieved via constructing a protective PVDF layer on Cu current collector through a facile and scalable doctor blade coating technique. As a result, PVDF@Cu current collector exhibits a stable cycling lifetime for 1200 h with a small overpotential (∼35 mV) at 1 mA cm−2, which is 6 times longer than the bare Cu current collector (∼200 h). Furthermore, PVDF@Cu current collector delivers a high average CE of 99.91% for 2000 h at 1 mA cm−2. The excellent electrochemical performances of PVDF@Cu current collectors are found to arise from the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase consisted of Na2O2 with a high shear modulus and rich NaF with a fast Na ion migration based on the defluorination reaction between PVDF and Na metal anode, which synergistically suppresses Na dendrite growth. This approach provides a new opportunity to stabilize Na metal anode.",Energy Storage Materials
Enhanced Protein Adsorption in Fibrous Substrates Treated with Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 (ZIF-8) Nanoparticles,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Development for new solid substrates for protein adsorption is important, given the massive potential in a number of fields including food production, medicine, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical processing. We developed a zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 (ZIF-8)-nanoparticles based fibrous platform (Platform 1). Its ability in protein adsorption is proven by fluorescence study of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG adsorbed on Platform 1. Studies reveal that Platform 1 shows much more enhanced protein adsorption compared to a polyethylene terephthalate gauze fibrous platform treated with ZIF-8 nanoparticles. This may be explained by considering that more active sites are enabled on fabric to adsorb a higher amount of ZIF-8 nanoparticles. We show that Platform 1 provides favorable biocompatibility to maintain the bioactivity of enzymes. Furthermore, we prove that a carboxymethylated cotton fabric platform treated with ZIF-8 (Platform 3) can be more capable of immobilizing the Alexa Fluor 647-labeled antibodies than Platform 1. Carboxymethylation helps to enhance protein adsorption in these cotton fabric substrates.",ACS Applied Nano Materials
Real-Time Imaging of the Electrochemical Process in Na-O2 Nanobatteries Using Pt@CNT and Pt0.8Ir0.2@CNT Air Cathodes,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Compared to lithium-oxygen batteries, sodium-oxygen (Na-O2) batteries exhibit a number of advantages: extremely low cost, low charging overpotential, and stability under nitrogen. However, accumulation of insoluble discharge products and failure of catalysts often result in poor performance of Na-O2 batteries and limit their cycling life. In this work, electrochemical reactions of Na-O2 batteries were directly investigated in situ by assembling a solid-state Na-O2 nanobattery in an aberration-corrected environmental transmission electron microscope. During discharge, NaO2 hollow spheres formed and expanded continuously, accompanying their partial decomposition into Na2O2. These spheres shrank and collapsed into Na2O2 nanoparticles during the charging process. Carbon nanotubes doped with Pt and bimetallic Pt/Ir nanoscale catalyst can promote product formation and reversible evolution. In-depth investigation of the electrochemical reaction mechanism in Na-O2 cells helps to accelerate the development of metal-air devices.",ACS Nano
Sulfur-Based Electrodes that Function via Multielectron Reactions for Room-Temperature Sodium-Ion Storage,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimEmerging rechargeable sodium-ion storage systems—sodium-ion and room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT-NaS) batteries—are gaining extensive research interest as low-cost options for large-scale energy-storage applications. Owing to their abundance, easy accessibility, and unique physical and chemical properties, sulfur-based materials, in particular metal sulfides (MSx) and elemental sulfur (S), are currently regarded as promising electrode candidates for Na-storage technologies with high capacity and excellent redox reversibility based on multielectron conversion reactions. Here, we present current understanding of Na-storage mechanisms of the S-based electrode materials. Recent progress and strategies for improving electronic conductivity and tolerating volume variations of the MSx anodes in Na-ion batteries are reviewed. In addition, current advances on S cathodes in RT-NaS batteries are presented. We outline a novel emerging concept of integrating MSx electrocatalysts into conventional carbonaceous matrices as effective polarized S hosts in RT-NaS batteries as well. This comprehensive progress report could provide guidance for research toward the development of S-based materials for the future Na-storage techniques.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Systematic parameter acquisition method for electrochemical model of 4.35 V LiCoO2 batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical model plays an important role in studying the relationship between the corresponding parameters and battery performance. To improve the accuracy and persuasion of the electrochemical model, a systematic method for key parameters acquisition in 4.35 V LiCoO2 batteries with wound type cell design is presented in this paper. The design specification, lithium ion concentrations, kinetic parameters are measured using different experimental and computational method. In this work, the volume fractions, porosity, states of charge of individual electrodes, diffusion coefficient and membrane impedance Rsf of LiCoO2/graphite pouch cells were estimated. It is found that the diffusion coefficients during discharge processes are larger than the values in the charge processes by Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), while the diffusion coefficient calculated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed two orders of magnitude smaller as compared with GITT. Based on the experimental and computational results obtained herein this work, the pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) electrochemical model can predict the electrochemical characteristics with high accuracy.",Solid State Ionics
Jackfruit-like electrode design for advanced Na-Se batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Sodium-selenium (Na–Se) batteries are attracting much attention because of their high energy density. However, their practical application is still restricted by rapid capacity fading resulting from the inferior electrode kinetics, low utilization of Se and enormous volumetric expansion. Herein, a jackfruit-like electrode is designed for advanced Na–Se batteries to solve these problems. The carbon nanorods are well-aligned to form a jackfruit-like design as the Se host. Thanks to the unique structure, many hollow nanochannels between nanorods are able to provide multifold pathways for Na-ions diffusion and electrolyte penetration. Moreover, the nanopores in carbon nanorods can provide adequate space to store Se and to buffer volumetric expansion during cycling. More importantly, the well-aligned carbon nanorods can enable a fast electron transfer to improve the utilization of Se. As a result, the jackfruit-like Se-carbon electrodes exhibit a high capacity of 616 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, outstanding rate capability and long cycling life up to 600 cycles at 2 C with a very low capacity decay of 0.066% per cycle.",Journal of Power Sources
All-Solid-State batteries based on glass-ceramic lithium vanadate,"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. All rights reserved.In this chapter, challenges in the development of all-solid-state batteries designed to solve the problem of safety of the chemical power sources are discussed. Difficulties in the development of such batteries are poor adhesion and electrical conductivity of solids and change in the volume of materials during charge/discharge processes. To solve these problems, the use of glassy or glass-ceramic materials as the electrode is suggested. Based on vanadates glasses and glass-ceramics have attracted the most significant attention among glassy electrode materials since glassy vanadates have rather high electrical conductivity in comparison with other oxide glasses (about 10-5 S·cm-1 at room temperature). In addition, the electrical conductivity of vanadate glasses can be significantly improved by obtaining of glass-ceramic based on them. Further, results of the test of all-solid-state battery with vanadate cathode are presented. It is shown that the voltage of Li-Ga glassy vanadate single cell achieves the value of 3.3 V.",Solid Electrolytes for Advanced Applications: Garnets and Competitors
Sparked Reduced Graphene Oxide for Lowerature Sodium-Beta Alumina Batteries,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Wetting Na metal on the solid electrolyte of a liquid Na battery determines the operating temperature and performance of the battery. At low temperatures below 200 °C, liquid Na wets poorly on a solid electrolyte near its melting temperature (Tm = 98 °C), limiting its suitability for use in lowerature batteries used for large-scale energy-storage systems. Herein, we propose the use of sparked reduced graphene oxide (rGO) that can improve the Na wetting in sodium-beta alumina batteries (NBBs), allowing operation at lower temperatures. Experimental and computational studies indicated rGO layers with nanogaps exhibited complete liquid Na wetting regardless of the surface energy between the liquid Na and the graphene oxide, which originated from the capillary force in the gap. Employing sparked rGO significantly enhanced the cell performance at 175 °C; the cell retained almost 100% Coulombic efficiency after the initial cycle, which is a substantial improvement over cells without sparked rGO. These results suggest that coating sparked rGO is a promising but simple strategy for the development of lowerature NBBs.",Nano Letters
Chirality Induces the Self-Assembly to Generate a 3D Porous Spiral-like Polyhedron as Metal-Free Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.The sluggish kinetics and large overpotential of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) severely limit the widespread production and application of metal-air batteries. Herein, a conductive three-dimensional (3D) porous spiral-like polyhedron structure composed of nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (L/D-SPNC) was utilized as catalysts with combination of 3D hierarchical porous properties and distinguishing intrinsic properties of two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets for ORR. The chiral template, l/d-tartaric acid, induces the self-assembly of the supramolecule and the formation of an orderly array of carbon with spiral-like surface feature on a molecular scale. The resulting L/D-SPNC exhibits a small wall thickness (2.5 nm), large specific surface area (2034.2 m2/g), and high conductivity (155.76 S/m), which indicates that the properties of 2D nanosheets building blocks are kept in 3D mode. As catalysts for ORR, the optimized L-SPNC-950-1 exhibits a more positive onset potential of 1.03 V compared with those of Pt/C (1.00 V) and a half-wave potential of 0.87 V is also comparable to those of Pt/C (0.87 V). Al-air battery discharge data demonstrate that the spiral-like structure facilitates the diffusion of the electrolyte and oxygen on a three-phase interface, causing weak polarization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove that the twisted surface aggravates the differential charge distribution between C-C/C-N bonds.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Revisiting the positive roles of liquid polysulfides in alkali metal-sulfur electrochemistry: From electrolyte additives to active catholyte,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Polysulfide dissolution and shuttling in liquid organic electrolytes are considered as the most challenging detrimental effects of an Li-S cell, which is one of the most promising next-generation high-energy-density batteries. Therefore, considerable efforts have been devoted to confining solid sulfur or sulfide so as to avoid the formation and diffusion of dissolved polysulfides. However, the positive roles played by the liquid polysulfides in Li-S electrochemistry should not be overlooked. Polysulfide dissolution can promote the cell kinetics and sulfur utilization; as electrolyte additives, polysulfides can help stabilize the Li metal anode, redistribute the active mass in the cathode and act as extra back-up active sulfur sources. After being applied directly as active catholytes, a novel Li-polysulfide redox flow battery (Li-PS RFB) and an Li-polysulfide battery (Li-PS battery) have been developed. This review revisited these beneficial effects of polysulfides and provided a summary of the recent progress on Li-PS RFB and Li-PS batteries, especially with a more comprehensive emphasis on the latter. Furthermore, dissolved polysulfides applied as active catholytes in Na-S and K-S systems and as catholytes or anolytes in aqueous batteries were also briefly discussed. Hopefully, the Li-S electrochemistry can be better understood so as to overcome challenging issues in the way of the practical commercialization of the Li-S batteries.",Nanoscale

In this work, three-dimensional porous microspheres composed of nanosized sulfur particles, nitrogen-doped oxygen-deficient TiO2-x nanorods and reduced graphene oxide (N-TiO2-x/RGO/S) were synthesized as sulfur host material for the first time in spray-drying process. The microspheres construction with void spaces mitigated volumetric expansion upon charge/discharge cycling and improved sulfur utilization. Furthermore, the N-TiO2-x nanorods enhanced the conductivity of the material and exhibited strong capability for adsorption and the migration of lithium polysulfides, which was demonstrated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Due to such advantages, the N-TiO2-x/RGO/S cathode delivered excellent rate capability and stable cycle performance at 1.0 C over 300 cycles with a specific capacity about 700 mAh g−1. This novel design and preparation strategy also contributes to the materials engineering and structural design towards remarkable improvement of electrochemical performance of energy storage systems.",Electrochimica Acta

The title material crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c with the unit cell parameters: a = 6.532(2) Å, b = 12.492(2) Å, c = 11.060(2) Å, β = 99.44 (2) , V = 890.3(3) Å3 and Z = 4. The peculiarity of this structure is the Al3+ and Co2+ distribution over four crystallographic independent sites. Charge distribution (CHARDI) calculations and bond-valence sum (BVS) analysis were used to support the proposed structural model. The crystal structure of the title compound features a 3D anionic framework built of corner-edge sharing (Al3+/Co2+)O6 and AsO4 polyhedra, with interconnecting channels where the Na+ cations are located. The title compound is a new member of Wylleite family with an additional new Na+ site denoted X(3). The modelling of pathways transport of Na+ in the anionic framework shows that only the sodium Na1 can diffuse through an infinite 1D pathway along [100] direction. The empirical activation energy deduced from the Bond-Valence Site Energy (BVSE) model is about 5.45 eV.",Materials Research Express
Recent Advances in Cathode Materials for Room-Temperature Sodium−Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRoom-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT−Na/S) batteries hold great promise to meet the requirements of large-scale energy storage due to their high theoretical energy density, low material cost, resource abundance, and environmental benignity. However, the poor cycle performance and low utilization of active sulfur greatly hinder their practical application. As the essential part directly related to the battery performance, the S-based cathode has attracted tremendous research interests in recent years.

Particularly, basic insights into the Na/S reaction mechanism are presented and representative works on S-based cathode materials are systematically summarized. The remaining challenges and developing trends of RT−Na/S batteries are also discussed. We hope this review can shed light on the field of next-generation metal-sulfur batteries.",ChemPhysChem
A New Superionic Plastic Polymorph of the Na+Conductor Na3PS4,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Na3PS4 is one of the most promising Na+ conductors, relevant for applications that can leverage its high ionic conductivity, such as solid-state batteries. Currently, two crystalline phases of the material have been identified, and it has been thought to melt above 500 °C. In contrast, based on diffraction, ab initio simulations, impedance spectroscopy, and thermal analysis, we show that Na3PS4 remains solid above this temperature and transforms to a third polymorph, γ, exhibiting fast-ion conduction and an orthorhombic crystal structure. We show that the fast Na+-conduction is associated with rotational motion of the thiophosphate polyanions pointing to a plastic crystal. These findings are of major importance for the development and understanding of new polyanion-based solid electrolytes.",ACS Materials Letters
Expediting redox kinetics of sulfur species by atomic-scale electrocatalysts in lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2019 The Authors. InfoMat published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of UESTC.Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have extremely high theoretical energy density that make them as promising systems toward vast practical applications. Expediting redox kinetics of sulfur species is a decisive task to break the kinetic limitation of insulating lithium sulfide/disulfide precipitation/dissolution. Herein, we proposed a porphyrin-derived atomic electrocatalyst to exert atomic-efficient electrocatalytic effects on polysulfide intermediates. Quantifying electrocatalytic efficiency of liquid/solid conversion through a potentiostatic intermittent titration technique measurement presents a kinetic understanding of specific phase evolutions imparted by the atomic electrocatalyst. Benefiting from atomically dispersed “lithiophilic” and “sulfiphilic” sites on conductive substrates, the finely designed atomic electrocatalyst endows Li–S cells with remarkable cycling stablity (cyclic decay rate of 0.10% in 300 cycles), excellent rate capability (1035 mAh g−1 at 2 C), and impressive areal capacity (10.9 mAh cm−2 at a sulfur loading of 11.3 mg cm−2).

Dehybridization effect in improved dehydrogenation of LiAlH4 by doping with two-dimensional Ti3C2,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdLowering the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers for dehydrogenation of high-capacity hydrides has been a key challenge for the realization of practical hydrogen energy. One of the most efficient strategies is doping hydrides with catalysis while nanosizing the composites. Although numerous catalytic additives have been investigated, more efficient dopants are still under exploration, and the underling mechanism of catalysis is highly desirable. In this study, a two-dimensional (2D) layered metal carbide, Ti3C2, was doped to improve the dehydrogenation performance of LiAlH4. The results show that, by doping 5 wt% of Ti3C2, the initial desorption temperature of LiAlH4 decreased significantly from 180.1 to 58.6 with 6.5 wt% of hydrogen release. Approximately 5.5 wt% of hydrogen was liberated from the LiAlH4+5 wt% Ti3C2 sample at 200 °C within 35 min. Combining density functional theory calculations, we reveal that contact of 2D Ti3C2 significantly decreases the desorption energy barrier of Al–H bonding in LiAlH4 and accelerates the breakdown of Al–H bonding through the interfacial charge transfer and the dehybridization of the Al–H cluster.",Materials Today Nano
Ti-Based Oxide Anode Materials for Advanced Electrochemical Energy Storage: Lithium/Sodium Ion Batteries and Hybrid Pseudocapacitors,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimTitanium-based oxides including TiO2 and M-Ti-O compounds (M = Li, Nb, Na, etc.) family, exhibit advantageous structural dynamics (2D ion diffusion path, open and stable structure for ion accommodations) for practical applications in energy storage systems, such as lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and hybrid pseudocapacitors. Further, Ti-based oxides show high operating voltage relative to the deposition of alkali metal, ensuring full safety by avoiding the formation of lithium and sodium dendrites. On the other hand, high working potential prevents the decomposition of electrolyte, delivering excellent rate capability through the unique pseudocapacitive kinetics. Nevertheless, the intrinsic poor electrical conductivity and reaction dynamics limit further applications in energy storage devices. Recently, various work and in-depth understanding on the morphologies control, surface engineering, bulk-phase doping of Ti-based oxides, have been promoted to overcome these issues. Inspired by that, in this review, the authors summarize the fundamental issues, challenges and advances of Ti-based oxides in the applications of advanced electrochemical energy storage. Particularly, the authors focus on the progresses on the working mechanism and device applications from lithium-ion batteries to sodium-ion batteries, and then the hybrid pseudocapacitors. In addition, future perspectives for fundamental research and practical applications are discussed.",Small
Hierarchical Composite of Rose-Like VS2@S/N-Doped Carbon with Expanded (001) Planes for Superior Li-Ion Storage,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimIn the present work, a hierarchical composite of rose-like VS2@S/N-doped carbon (VS2@SNC) with expanded (001) planes is successfully fabricated through a facile synthetic route. Notably, the d-spacing of (001) planes is expanded to 0.92 nm, which is proved to dramatically reduce the energy barrier for Li+ diffusion in the composite of VS2@SNC by density functional theory calculation. On the other hand, the S/N-doped carbon in the composite greatly promotes the electrical conductivity and enhances the structural stability. In addition, the hierarchical structure of VS2@SNC facilitates rapid electrolyte diffusion and increases the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte simultaneously. Benefiting from the merits mentioned above, the VS2@SNC electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties, such as a large reversible capacity of 971.6 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, an extremely high rate capability of 772.1 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1, and a remarkable cycling stability up to 600 cycles at 8 A g−1 with a capacity of 684.5 mA h g−1, making it a promising candidate as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries.",Small
Electrochemically Stable Sodium Metal-Tellurium/Carbon Nanorods Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimElectrochemical metal cells utilizing tellurium and sodium chemistry are being extensively explored for developing advanced high-performance batteries. The daunting challenges, however, still remain with low rate capability/volumetric capacity, unclear redox reaction processes, and the notorious sodium dendrites. Here, a cell design that features a novel Te/carbon nanorods cathode and a tailored ether-based electrolyte is reported. It is the first report of Na metal-Te full batteries with performance comparable to those of reported Na-S and Na-Se batteries at low ratings. By using the semimetal Te instead of the insulating S or Se, the Na-Te batteries actually outperform reported Na-S and Na-Se batteries at high ratings. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, UV–vis spectrum, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy results clearly reveal a three-step redox process and stability of the Na metal-Te cells. These comprehensive results demonstrate the feasibility of practical Na metal-Te batteries with high volumetric energy density and a viable cell fabrication cost.",Advanced Energy Materials
MoN Supported on Graphene as a Bifunctional Interlayer for Advanced Li-S Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRational design of effective polysulfide barriers is highly important for high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. A variety of adsorbents have been applied as interlayers to alleviate the shuttle effect. Nevertheless, the unsuccessful oxidation of Li2S on interlayers leads to loss of active materials and blocks Li ion transport. In this work, a MoN-based interlayer sandwiched between the C-S cathode and the separator is developed. Such an interlayer not only strongly binds lithium polysulfides via Mo-S bonding but also efficiently accelerates the decomposition of Li2S. The acceleration mechanism toward Li2S decomposition is determined to be a combination of contributions of catalytic cleavage of Li-S bond in Li2S based on the proposed covalence-activation mechanism and rapid migration of the produced Li ions. As a result, the C–S cathodes with the as-developed interlayer manifest a negligible charging potential barrier and outstanding cycling stability with a very low capacity fading rate of 0.023% per cycle during 1500 cycles at 1 C. High areal capacity of 6.02 mAh cm−2 is achieved for high sulfur loading of 7.0 mg cm−2 after cycling at 0.1 C. The material and strategy demonstrated in this work can open the door toward developing shuttle suppression interlayers without impairing cathode performance.",Advanced Energy Materials
Repelling Polysulfides Using White Graphite Introduced Polymer Membrane as a Shielding Layer in Ambient Temperature Sodium Sulfur Battery,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimHerein, a strategy is demonstrated to effectively control the sodium polysulfide dissolution using composite polymer blend membrane. The sufficient interconnected pores in the white graphite introduced polymer blend membrane plays a multifunctional role as an ion selective membrane, evident from the ionic conductivity of 10−3 S cm−1 facilitating the movement of sodium ions and the presence of boron and nitrogen in white graphite acts as an effective absorbent to trap sodium polysulfides. The electrochemical testing reveals significant improvement of about 87.6% in specific capacity when compared to the cell without white graphite@ polymer membrane. Also, the cell exhibits an excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 83.1% at the end of 500 cycles. Other than the performance enhancement, the self-discharge battery is significantly reduced using the developed membrane. The better performance of the room temperature sodium sulfur battery is attributed to the physical and chemical confinement of composite polymer membrane which is also evident from the post analysis study. This is the first attempt of utilizing composite polymer membrane as a blocking layer in room temperature sodium sulfur batteries and is promising for the construction of high performance batteries.",Advanced Materials Interfaces
Encapsulating lithium and sodium inside amorphous carbon nanotubes through gold-seeded growth,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdMetallic lithium promises the ultimate anode material for building next-generation Li batteries, though some fundamental hurdles remain unsolved. Li growth induced by hetero particles/atoms has recently emerged as a highly efficient route enabling spatial-control and dendrite-free Li deposition on anode hosts. However, the detailed mechanism of Li nucleation and its interaction with heterogeneous seeds are largely unknown. Herein, we investigate this issue by visualizing Au-seeded Li nucleation processes that guide Li deposition inside the one-dimensional hollow space of individual amorphous carbon nanotubes by in-situ transmission electron microscopy. A reversible two-step conversion process during Au–Li alloying/dealloying reactions is revealed, suggesting that the formation of Li3Au plays the actual role in inducing Li nucleation. We propose a front-growth scenario to explain the spatially confined Li growth and stripping kinetic behaviors, which involves the mass addition and removal at the deposition front through ion diffusion along the tubular carbon shell. As a comparison, nanotubes without gold seeds inside exhibit uncontrolled dendrite-like Li growth outside the carbon shell. We further demonstrate that Au-seed growth can be successful in encapsulating sodium metal for the first time. These findings provide mechanistic insights into heterogeneous seeded Li/Na nucleation and space-confined deposition for design of high-performance battery anodes.",Nano Energy
Synthesis of RuNi alloy nanostructures composed of multilayered nanosheets for highly efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdRational design and synthesis of materials for highly efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of paramount importance in the development and utilization of renewable energy. Here, RuNi alloy nanostructures (RuNi NSs) composed of multilayered nanosheets are prepared through a one-pot solvothermal process. Impressively, they exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic HER activity under alkaline conditions with a low overpotential of only 15 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of only 28 mV dec−1, much better than those of commercial Ru/C and Pt/C catalysts. This superior performance could be attributed to their large electrochemically active surface area (154 m2 g−1), and the Ni alloying effect which facilitates the water dissociation and optimizes the hydrogen adsorption and desorption. This work paves the way to the rational design and synthesis of new materials for highly efficient electrocatalysis.",Nano Energy

Structural water and disordered structure promote aqueous sodium-ion energy storage in sodium-birnessite,"© 2019, The Author(s).Birnessite is a low-cost and environmentally friendly layered material for aqueous electrochemical energy storage; however, its storage capacity is poor due to its narrow potential window in aqueous electrolyte and low redox activity. Herein we report a sodium rich disordered birnessite (Na0.27MnO2) for aqueous sodium-ion electrochemical storage with a much-enhanced capacity and cycling life (83 mAh g−1 after 5000 cycles in full-cell). Neutron total scattering and in situ X-ray diffraction measurements show that both structural water and the Na-rich disordered structure contribute to the improved electrochemical performance of current cathode material. Particularly, the co-deintercalation of the hydrated water and sodium-ion during the high potential charging process results in the shrinkage of interlayer distance and thus stabilizes the layered structure. Our results provide a genuine insight into how structural disordering and structural water improve sodium-ion storage in a layered electrode and open up an exciting direction for improving aqueous batteries.",Nature Communications
Design and Construction of Sodium Polysulfides Defense System for Room-Temperature Na–S Battery,"© 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRoom-temperature Na–S batteries are facing one of the most serious challenges of charge/discharge with long cycling stability due to the severe shuttle effect and volume expansion. Herein, a sodium polysulfides defense system is presented by designing and constructing the cathode-separator double barriers. In this strategy, the hollow carbon spheres are decorated with MoS2 (HCS/MoS2) as the S carrier (S@HCS/MoS2). Meanwhile, the HCS/MoS2 composite is uniformly coated on the surface of the glass fiber as the separator. During the discharge process, the MoS2 can adsorb soluble polysulfides (NaPSs) intermediates and the hollow carbon spheres can improve the conductivity of S as well as act as the reservoir for electrolyte and NaPSs, inhibiting them from entering the anode to make Na deteriorate. As a result, the cathode-separator group applied to room-temperature Na–S battery can enable a capacity of ≈1309 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and long cycling life up to 1000 cycles at 1 C. This study provides a novel and effective way to develop durable room-temperature Na–S batteries.",Advanced Science
Factors of Kinetics Processes in Lithium–Sulfur Reactions,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium–Sulfur (Li–S) batteries are among the most promising next-generation secondary battery technologies due to their high theoretical energy density. However, the Li–S reaction is a multistep process and a solid–liquid–solid phase transition process, relating to complex reaction kinetics. Moreover, the poor conductivity of sulfur hinders effective electron transport, and large volume expansion leads to electrode pulverization, causing the electrode to lose effective electrical contact, which decreases the kinetics. In this review, the factors influencing kinetics processes in Li–S electrochemistry are reviewed, starting from the design of sulfur host materials, along with electrode structure. Then, the cell design including electrolyte, interlayer, etc., is discussed further. Finally, insights on how to improve the kinetics are provided, which is expected to provide direction for further kinetic investigation of Li–S batteries.",Energy Technology

KGaA, WeinheimLi–CO2 batteries are an attractive technology for converting CO2 into energy. However, the decomposition of insulating Li2CO3 on the cathode during discharge is a barrier to practical application. Here, it is demonstrated that a high loading of single Co atoms (≈5.3%) anchored on graphene oxide (adjacent Co/GO) acts as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for Li–CO2 batteries. This targeted dispersion of atomic Co provides catalytically adjacent active sites to decompose Li2CO3. The adjacent Co/GO exhibits a highly significant sustained discharge capacity of 17 358 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 for >100 cycles. Density functional theory simulations confirm that the adjacent Co electrocatalyst possesses the best performance toward the decomposition of Li2CO3 and maintains metallic-like nature after the adsorption of Li2CO3.",Advanced Functional Materials
Nickel sulfide nanocrystals on nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanotubes with high-efficiency electrocatalysis for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2019, The Author(s).Polysulfide dissolution and slow electrochemical kinetics of conversion reactions lead to low utilization of sulfur cathodes that inhibits further development of room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. Here we report a multifunctional sulfur host, NiS2 nanocrystals implanted in nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanotubes, which is rationally designed to achieve high polysulfide immobilization and conversion. Attributable to the synergetic effect of physical confinement and chemical bonding, the high electronic conductivity of the matrix, closed porous structure, and polarized additives of the multifunctional sulfur host effectively immobilize polysulfides. Significantly, the electrocatalytic behaviors of the Lewis base matrix and the NiS2 component are clearly evidenced by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction and density functional theory with strong adsorption of polysulfides and high conversion of soluble polysulfides into insoluble Na2S2/Na2S. Thus, the as-obtained sulfur cathodes exhibit excellent performance in room-temperature Na/S batteries.",Nature Communications
Highly cross-linked carbon sponge enables room-temperature long-life semi-liquid Na/polysulfide battery,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdSodium/sulfur (Na/S) batteries are actively studied due to their low cost and potential energy density. Improvements have been achieved in the room temperature Na/S batteries during the last decades, however still with low practical capacity and unstable cycling performance. We hereby report a semi-liquid Na/polysulfide (Na/PS) cell with unique microscale intertwined carbon/polymer sponges to alleviate sulfur loss during cycling. The as-prepared highly cross-linked structure not only facilitates mass transfer but provides functional reservoir to entrap polysulfides. The Na/PS batteries with low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio (∼4.05 μL/mg) retain 375 mA h/g capacity after 200 cycles. More importantly, the interlinked sponge with high sulfur loading (e.g. 1.9 mg/cm2) restricts the decay rate of open-circuit voltage to only 0.04‰ per hour, which overcomes the severe self-discharge behavior observed in many Na/S cells. The highly cross-linked sponge therefore is an efficient approach to addressing the notorious challenges of Na/PS batteries.",Materials Today Energy

Side reactions between the sodium metal and liquid electrolyte, as well as sodium dendrite formation, are successfully suppressed, especially at 60 °C. The sodium vanadium phosphate/sodium full cells with composite electrolyte exhibit 95.3% and 78.8% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1 C at 25 °C and 60 °C, respectively.",Nature Communications

Herein, we design and synthesize freestanding graphitized carbon interlayers decorated with Fe/Fe3C nanocatalysts by thermal treatment of cellulose paper with adsorbed ferric nitrate at 1000 °C, during which the freestanding carbon network derives from the cellulose paper while the Fe results from the reduction of Fe3+ with a carbothermal reduction process; simultaneously, the in situ formed Fe boosts graphitization of carbon to enhance electrical conductivity of the interlayer, and the carbon network effectively helps confine and accommodate Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles. Therefore, the well dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles catalytically accelerate electrochemical conversion of polysulfides, while the enhanced conductive network of carbon benefits the electron transfer during the electrocatalytic process.

Sodium ion incorporated alumina - A versatile anisotropic ceramic,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdThe present article is a review of crystal structure dependent anisotropic properties of β and β″-phases of sodium ion incorporated alumina.

Conducting plane between two consecutive spinel aluminas constituting loosely bound mobile sodium ions, promote ionic conductivity in the parallel direction. In contrary, the restricted movement of ions in the orthogonal direction brings about polarization giving it directional dielectric property. High ionic conductivity of 1.3 S/cm and large dielectric constant of ˜ 200 are reported. Exchanging sodium ions with different cations, such as potassium and lithium, results in similar anisotropy.

High-Performance Na-Ion Storage of S-Doped Porous Carbon Derived from Conjugated Microporous Polymers,"© 2019, © 2019, The Author(s).Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to the high abundance and low cost of Na. It is well known that S doping can improve the electrochemical performance of carbon materials for NIBs. However, the current methods for S doping in carbons normally involve toxic precursors or rigorous conditions. In this work, we report a creative and facile strategy for preparing S-doped porous carbons (SCs) via the pyrolysis of conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs). Briefly, thiophene-based CMPs served as the precursors and doping sources simultaneously. Simple direct carbonization of CMPs produced S-doped carbon materials with highly porous structures. When used as an anode for NIBs, the SCs exhibited a high reversible capacity of 440 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 100 cycles, superior rate capability, and excellent cycling stability (297 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 500 mA g−1), outperforming most S-doped carbon materials reported thus far. The excellent performance of the SCs is attributed to the expanded lattice distance after S doping. Furthermore, we employed ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to investigate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of the SCs during sodiation–desodiation, which can highlight the role of doped S for Na-ion storage.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano-Micro Letters
"Effect of ionic liquids on the electrical, structural and morphological properties of P(VdF-HFP)–NaTF electrolytes","© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Polymer electrolytes with different ionic liquids, 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate (BMImTf), were prepared. Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VdF-HFP)) was used as polymer and sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaTf) as salt. Maximum ionic conductivity for the polymer electrolyte was observed as 1.03 × 10−3 Scm−1 and 1.37 × 10−3 Scm−1 for the addition of 20 wt% of BMImTf and for 40 wt% of PMII respectively. The dielectric behaviour of the samples was studied by analysing the complex dielectric permittivity. It was observed from the XRD studies that the amorphicity of the PMII added system was greater than the system added with BMImTf. FTIR analysis confirmed the occurrence of complexation and interaction among the components. Quantity of free ion and contact ion pairs was calculated using the deconvolution of the FTIR spectrum which supported the determined ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolytes. The BMImTf-added system was identified as more thermally stable than the PMII-added system. DSC confirmed the enhancement of amorphous phase in polymer electrolyte after the addition of ionic liquid. SEM images illustrated the role of porous structures on the ionic conductivity of the films. AFM analysis of the polymer electrolytes showed that the morphological change induced by PMII was higher than BMImTf.",Ionics
Non-flammable electrolyte for dendrite-free sodium-sulfur battery,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Room temperature (RT) sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries are a promising technology for stationary energy storage thanks to their high energy density of 1274 Wh kg−1 and low cost. However, RT Na-S batteries are hazardous because they use highly volatile and flammable electrolytes. Here, we develop a new nonflammable electrolyte for RT Na-S batteries, consisting of sodium trifluoromethanesulfonimide (NaTFSI) in a mixture of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). The nonflammable electrolyte facilitates highly stable and reversible Na plating/stripping during cycles. The dendrite-free Na-S battery with the NaTFSI/TMP+FEC electrolyte delivers a remarkable reversible capacity of 788 ​mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 1C, corresponding to a negligible capacity decay below 0.04% per cycle. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and surface analysis reveal the formation of a NaF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film with reduced interfacial resistance thanks to the introduction of FEC into the electrolyte. The formed NaF SEI layer suppresses the growth of Na dendrites on the anode, enhancing the electrochemical performance of the RT Na-S batteries. The new findings reported here will shed new light on dendrite-free RT Na-S batteries by the rational design of nonflammable electrolytes.",Energy Storage Materials
Electrolyte Evolution Propelling the Development of Nonlithium Metal–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Interlayers for lithium-based batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The increasing demands for the clean energy have steered the rapid development of energy storage devices with high energy and power density as well as high energy utilization efficiency. Lithium (Li)-based batteries are the most potential ones and are being intensively studied owing to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density. Despite the necessary device components including the cathodes, electrolytes and anodes, the use of interlayers is also of great significance for better performance of the battery. In lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, the interlayers enable selective control of polysulfides shuttling, while not disturbing the ion transfer. In-situ formed interlayers (solid electrolyte interphase) or artificial interlayers can also modify the physico-chemical properties or prevent the formation of Li dendrites to stabilize the metallic Li anodes. Interlayers are inert in these devices but they are indispensable to construct a better operation environment for these devices just like what the cell membrane does. In this review, we discuss the most recent applications of emerging interlayer system in Li-based batteries (Li-S batteries and Li metal anode) by proposing the “cell membrane” concept as a model. We aim to use such an analogy to build up a common concept and designing principle of the interlayers for better understanding their work mechanism and fully address the significance of interlayers. This review concludes with some personal perspectives which will shed some light on the emerging requirements of the “cell-membrane-like” interlayer system for guiding future development of advanced Li-based batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Uniform nucleation of sodium in 3D carbon nanotube framework via oxygen doping for long-life and efficient Na metal anodes,"© 2019The Na metal anode has long been considered as one of the most promising anode types due to its high theoretical capacity and its having the lowest electrochemical potential. Safety concerns, low efficiency, and large volume changes are severe hurdles blocking its practical application, however, especially in the case of high areal capacity. Herein, an oxygen-doped carbon nanotube framework (a-CNTs) obtained after acidification has been adopted as the Na plating matrix to regulate the homogeneous nucleation of Na metal and suppress dendrite growth. The oxygenic functional groups on the carbon nanotubes induce them “sodiophilic”, which guides the homogeneous nucleation and uniform deposition of Na. In addition, the cross-conductive network and high specific surface area of a-CNTs further enhance the electrochemical performances. As a result, a-CNTs have enabled reversible plating/stripping for 1000 cycles with coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at 3 mA cm−2 for 1 mA h cm−2. Furthermore, the symmetrical cells could run stably for 1650 cycles at 3 mA cm−2 for 1 mA h cm−2, and even could run for more than 300 h at 5 mA cm−2 at 8 mA h cm−2, which has rarely been achieved under such aggressive working conditions.",Energy Storage Materials
Liquid electrolyte immobilized in compact polymer matrix for stable sodium metal anodes,"© 2019Sodium metal batteries suffer from severe capacity decay due to the continuous side-reactions between sodium metal anode and conventional carbonate electrolyte using porous glass fiber (GF) membranes as the separator, especially at elevated temperature. Moreover, sodium dendrites preferentially propagate through the low-modulus pores and cause severe safety issues. Here a compact gel polymer electrolyte (GF-GPE) with high ionic conductivity is developed by tightly immobilizing liquid electrolyte in polymer matrix embedded in GF membranes. The extensive interaction between the liquid electrolyte and polymer matrix promotes the formation of a stable Na/GF-GPE interface to effectively reduce the side reactions at both room and elevated temperature. The GF-GPE could regulate the depth concentration profile of NaF, a key solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) component, to deter sodium dendrites formation and side reactions. As a result, the Na3V2(PO4)3/GF-GPE/Na cell presents outstanding cycling stability. Its capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1C under room temperature is as high as 95% and that after 500 cycles at 60 °C reaches 84%. This study successfully develops a robust and scalable approach by using a compact gel polymer electrolyte to achieve stable sodium metal anodes at room and elevated temperature.",Energy Storage Materials
Ether-compatible sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode with excellent performance enabled by fast kinetics via selenium doping,"© 2019, The Author(s).Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile is suggested to contain Sn (n ≤ 4) and shows good electrochemical performance in carbonate electrolytes for lithium sulfur batteries. However inferior results in ether electrolytes suggest that high solubility of Li2Sn (n ≤ 4) trumps the limited redox conversion, leading to dissolution and shuttling. Here, we introduce a small amount of selenium in sulfurized polyacrylonitrile to accelerate the redox conversion, delivering excellent performance in both carbonate and ether electrolytes, including high reversible capacity (1300 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1), 84% active material utilization and high rate (capacity up to 900 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1). These cathodes can undergo 800 cycles with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency and ultralow 0.029% capacity decay per cycle. Polysulfide dissolution is successfully suppressed by enhanced reaction kinetics. This work demonstrates an ether compatible sulfur cathode involving intermediate Li2Sn (n ≤ 4), attractive rate and cycling performance, and a promising solution towards applicable lithium-sulfur batteries.",Nature Communications
Recent advances in shuttle effect inhibition for lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are one of the most promising batteries in the future due to its high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g−1) and energy density (2600 Wh kg−1). However, the severe capacity fading caused by shuttle effect of polysulfide needs to be addressed before the practical application of Li-S batteries. In this review, we summarized the formation mechanism and the corresponding inhibition strategies of shuttle effect. The formation of polysulfide shuttle effect is classified into five steps: (i) formation of long-chain polysulfide, (ii) detaching of polysulfide from sulfur host, (iii) dissolution of polysulfide into electrolyte, (iv) migration of polysulfide toward lithium anode side, and (v) reaction between polysulfide and lithium anode. The corresponding strategies are reviewed and discussed step by step according to the shuttle effect formation steps of polysulfide. Evaluation and perspective of the current strategies are also discussed in this review in order to provide new view points for researchers.",Energy Storage Materials
Novel Metallic Crystalline Phase of Li2S3,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Poor electrical conductivity of the redox end solid products is one of the most important reasons impeding commercialization of Li-S battery. One of the solid intermediate products, Li2S2, is well-characterized, but the nature of the higher-order polysulfides is still somewhat unknown. In this paper, we focus on Li2S3, investigating its structural and electronic properties. The calculated results based on density functional theory find the cubic phase to be the ground state of Li2S3. Analysis of the vibrational spectrum suggests the cubic Li2S3 to be dynamically stable. The calculated density of states predicts the cubic Li2S3 to be metallic, which is due to excess S2 dimers relative to Li atoms in the unit cell. Moreover, a signature peak at 2471 eV observed in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectrum of Li polysulfides has been identified. Overall, the calculated results provide insight into the nature of one of the intermediate Li-S redox solid products, thereby facilitating efforts via a controlled synthesis of conducting Li-S redox species to advance the design of the cathode material for Li-S battery.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
"A Sodiophilic Interphase-Mediated, Dendrite-Free Anode with Ultrahigh Specific Capacity for Sodium-Metal Batteries","© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimDespite efforts to stabilize sodium metal anodes and prevent dendrite formation, achieving long cycle life with high areal capacities remains difficult owing to a combination of complex failure modes that involve retardant uneven sodium nucleation and subsequent dendrite formation. Now, a sodiophilic interphase based on oxygen-functionalized carbon nanotube networks is presented, which concurrently facilitates a homogeneous sodium nucleation and a dendrite-free, lateral growth behavior upon recurring sodium plating/stripping processes. This sodiophilic interphase renders sodium anodes with an ultrahigh capacity of 1078 mAh g−1 (areal capacity of 10 mAh cm−2), approaching the theoretical capacity of 1166 mAh g−1 of pure sodium, as well as a long cycle life up to 3000 cycles. Implementation of this anode allows for the construction of a sodium–air battery with largely enhanced cycling performance owing to the oxygen functionalization-mediated, dendrite-free sodium morphology.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Mega High Utilization of Sodium Metal Anodes Enabled by Single Zinc Atom Sites,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Low utilization of active metallic sodium (Na) and uncontrollable growth of Na dendrites remain significant challenges for high-performance Na metal batteries, which are limited to inefficient Na utilization (<1%) and shallow cycling conditions (0.25-1.0 mAh cm-2). In this work, a kind of Na metal anode with record-high utilization and long-term cycling stability is reported, using carbon-substrate-supported nitrogen-anchored zinc (Zn) single atoms as a current collector. Single Zn atom sites which serve as a strong ""magnet"" for Na ions, can guide the metallic Na uniform nucleation and free from dendrite-induced short circuit. The nucleation overpotential of our strategy is essentially zero, where most of the reported modified substrates were greatly exceed 20 mV. Specifically, the Na anodes exhibit a high Na stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency with 99.8% over 350 cycles and a stable voltage response with small voltage hysteresis after cycling 1000 h. The full cell exhibits high Na utilization up to 100% and superior long-term cycling stability for more than 1000 cycles with excellent capacity retention. In terms of lifetime and Na utilization, the Na metal anodes based on our strategy significantly outperforms the reported state-of-the-art Na metal anodes. Moreover, this affords new insights into the controllable Na nucleation behavior and high Na utilization and sheds fresh light on atomic level design of an electrode for Na metal anodes.",Nano Letters
The effect of calcium impurities of β″-alumina on the degradation of NaxCoO2 cathodes in all solid state sodium-ion batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.β″-alumina is a promising solid electrolyte candidate for room-temperature all-solid-state sodium-ion batteries due to its high sodium ionic conductivity of up to 10− 2 S cm− 1 at room temperature. However, calcium impurities are known to be present in the Al2O3 precursors used to produce commercial β″-alumina. Here we present a study on the impact of the calcium impurities which are diffusing in a temperature controlled process from the β″-alumina substrates into the NaxCoO2 layered oxide cathode. The increasing calcium content in the NaxCoO2 cathode leads to a degradation due to the formation of the calcium-rich Ca3Co4O9 phase. The electrochemical performance of sodium-ion batteries is investigated with NaxCoO2/β″-alumina/Na solid-state model batteries. The thin-film cathodes were grown onto commercial β″-alumina ceramic substrates by pulsed laser deposition and cycled between 2.0 and 3.8 V with metallic sodium anodes.",Solid State Ionics
Ultrafine Titanium Nitride Sheath Decorated Carbon Nanofiber Network Enabling Stable Lithium Metal Anodes,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimNonuniform local electric field and few nucleation sites on the reactive interface tend to cause detrimental lithium (Li) dendrites, which incur severe safety hazards and hamper the practical application of Li metal anodes in batteries. Herein, a carbon nanofiber (CNF) mat decorated with ultrafine titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles (CNF-TiN) as both current collector and host material is reported for Li metal anodes. Uniform Li deposition is achieved by a synergetic effect of lithiophilic TiN and 3D CNF configuration with a highly conductive network. Theoretical calculations reveal that Li prefers to be adsorbed onto the TiN sheath with a low diffusion energy barrier, leading to controllable nucleation sites and dendrite-free Li deposits. Moreover, the pseudocapacitive behavior of TiN identified through kinetics analysis is favorable for ultrafast Li+ storage and the charge transfer process, especially under a high plating/stripping rate. The CNF-TiN-modified Li anodes deliver lower nucleation overpotential for Li plating and superior electrochemical performance under a large current density (200 cycles at 3 mA cm−2) and high capacity (100 cycles with 6 mAh cm−2), as well as a long-running lifespan (>600 h). The CNF-TiN-based full cells using lithium iron phosphate and sulfur cathodes exhibit excellent cycling stability.",Advanced Functional Materials
Controlling the thickness of amorphous layer on Cu3(PO4)2 particle for promoted sodium storage reversibility as a conversion-reaction-based cathode,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The conversion reaction can provide a high specific capacity through a multiple electron transmission in redox reaction, but there are few studies on the conversion-reaction-based cathode materials in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) currently. The Cu3(PO4)2 material based on conversion reaction has gradually attracted researchers’ attention due to its high specific capacity, good thermal stability, etc. However, the reversibility of Cu3(PO4)2 in the conversion reaction process is poor, resulting in the short cycle life. To solve this problem, the Cu3(PO4)2 with different thickness of amorphous layer was synthesized by controlling the solid phase reaction temperature. It was found that the Cu3(PO4)2 with a 3 nm amorphous layer showed an enhanced cyclic stability. The reversible capacity remained at 112 mAh g−1 after 30 cycles under a current density of 0.1 A g−1. Further electrochemical characterization showed that the suitable thickness of amorphous layer can maintain the reaction products Na3PO4 and Cu a good electrical contact and bring a good charge transfer ability even after conversion reaction. It promoted the reversibility in conversion process and led to an enhanced cycle performance. The mechanism discussed in this paper may provide reference for improving the performance of other conversion-reaction-based materials.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
Ultrafine Co2P nanorods wrapped by graphene enable a long cycle life performance for a hybrid potassium-ion capacitor,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Given their high theoretical capacities, metal phosphides are anticipated to be excellent charge-storage materials for high-efficiency potassium-ion batteries. However, one of the major problems is the shuttling of heavy and large K+ ions between electrodes, which triggers rapid capacity fading. Here, we demonstrate that sub-4 nm Co2P nanorods attached to reduced graphene oxide (Co2P@rGO) can operate at a lifespan exceeding thousands of cycles. By taking advantage of the high electronic conductivity and flexibility of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), the composite electrode delivers a high capacity (374 mA h g-1 at 20 mA g-1) and excellent C-rate capability (141 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1), superior to its commercial counterpart. Impressively, the electrode maintains 54% of the capacity over 5000 cycles, and there is almost no capacity fading after the initial 200 cycles. In addition, a hybrid potassium-ion capacitor, assembled from a Co2P@rGO anode and activated carbon cathode, affords a high energy/power density (87 W h kg-1 and 4260 W kg-1) in a potential window of 1.0-4.0 V, as well as a long lifespan of over 1000 cycles. These extremes demonstrate the high-performance of the Co2P@rGO anode materials and an optimal synthesis strategy to boost K+ storage performance.",Nanoscale Horizons
Two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx@S as cathode for room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Room temperature sodium-sulfur battery has special research value due to the low cost of sulfur resource and its high specific capacity. However, the cathode material of the room temperature sodium-sulfur battery mainly combines carbon materials and elemental sulfur now, and the utilization of the sulfur is low. Herein, a two-dimensional layered material Ti3C2Tx was prepared. The cathode material of Ti3C2Tx@S was prepared by a simple melting method at 155 °C, and the mass percentage of the sublimed sulfur was 55%. Then, the valence states of Ti and C were characterized by XPS after loading the sublimed sulfur. The results indicated that a part of Ti3+ turned into the Ti4+, and some C–S bonds were formed. Additionally, the electrochemical properties of Ti3C2Tx@S were studied in sodium-ion battery under ambient conditions. The battery exhibited excellent rates performance, the first discharge specific capacity was 447.0 mAh g−1, and a specific capacity of 120.0 mAh g−1 was maintained at the current density of 1000 mA g−1. In addition, Ti3C2Tx@S demonstrated excellent cycle stability in room temperature sodium-sulfur battery. In the case of a current density of 100 mA g−1, the discharge specific capacity was maintained at 150.0 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles, and the capacity retention rate was 80% from the second cycle. For the electrode, the specific capacity still remained 107.7 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles.",Ionics
Reduced graphene oxide aerogel as stable host for dendrite-free sodium metal anode,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Sodium (Na) metal has attracted great attention as a promising anode for next-generation energy storage systems because of its abundant resources, potentially low cost, and high theoretical capacity. However, severe dendrite growth, large volume expansion during plating/stripping lead to poor cycle performance and limit the practical application of sodium metal anodes. Here, oriented freeze-drying and molten infusion are used to synthesize a Na-infused reduced graphene oxide aerogel (Na@rGa) composite anode using a reduced graphene oxide aerogel (rGa) as a stable host. This unique host shows ultra-light weight which guarantees high capacity (1064 mAh g−1), and the large specific surface area and uniform pores effectively lower the local current density and uniform electrolyte distribution from the inner to the outside of electrode. The Na@rGa anode exhibits low overpotential (50 mV) and stable cycle performance for 1000 cycles at 5 mA cm−2 in carbonate electrolyte system. The electrochemical performance of a full cell using the Na@rGa composite anode is clearly superior to that of a reference cell.

Tuning sodium nucleation and stripping by the mixed surface of carbon nanotube-sodium composite electrodes for improved reversibility,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Metallic sodium is regarded as a promising anode material for sodium rechargeable batteries. However, sodium dendrite growth and exhaustive electrolyte decomposition cause the poor reversibility of the sodium metal electrode. Here, we present that, by forming a mixed surface of carbon and sodium metal, the sodium electrodeposition mode and stripping mechanism can be tuned. In order to systematically investigate sodium plating/stripping behavior on a mixed surface of carbon and sodium, we fabricate a carbon nanotube-sodium composite electrode with a simple rolling and folding method. As the carbon nanotube content is increased, the overpotentials for sodium nucleation and pit-formation are remarkably reduced. Postmortem and chronoamperometry analysis elucidate that sodium and sodiated carbon nanotube have a different sodium nucleation mode, and sodium nucleation is preferred on the sodiated carbon nanotube surface with lower nucleation energy, inducing a more uniform sodium deposition. Furthermore, the embedded carbon nanotube appears to help sodium stripping by providing a channel for a more facile sodium ion transport. As a result, the carbon nanotube-sodium composite electrode exhibites a 5 times higher cycling stability. The tuning of the nucleation and stripping behaviors by forming a mixed surface can be a viable approach for enhancing the reversibility of metal electrode.",Journal of Power Sources

The intense anchoring (by Fe2O3) and rapid electron transfer (by Fe3C) for lithium polysulfides transformation can be simultaneously achieved on the Fe2O3-Fe3C heterostructure interface, thus preventing the amassment of lithium polysulfides benefiting from its excellent interfacial contact and improving sulfur utilization. Experimental characterizations and DFT calculations confirmed the restrained polysulfides shuttle and enhanced redox kinetics. Therefore, the battery containing optimal Fe2O3-Fe3C heterostructure delivered a high capacity of 776.2 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 1 C at a low fading rate of 0.037% per cycle. Even at a high sulfur loading of 3.5 and 4.5 mg cm-2, high capacities of 773.6 and 533.6 mA h g-1 at 0.5 C can be achieved with capacity retentions of 91.7 and 94.2%, respectively.

Among these, the lithium-ion battery is the most important option due to the high energy density, good stability, and low discharge rate. However, the thermal safety problem of lithium-ion battery cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is very necessary to explore an effective thermal management system for battery module. Here, a thermal silica cooling plate-aluminate thermal plate (SCP-ATP) coupling with forced convection air cooling system as a thermal management system is proposed for improving the cooling performance of pouch battery module. The results reveal that the heat dissipating performance and temperature uniformity of pouch battery module with SCP-ATP are greatly improved compared with other thermal management systems. Moreover, the highest temperature can be controlled below 50°C, and the temperature differences can be maintained with 3°C when the SCP-ATP coupling forced convection is utilized to enhance the heat transfer coefficient. Furthermore, considering the cooling effectiveness and consumption cost comprehensively, the optimal air velocity of the SCP-ATP coupling forced convection cooling system is 9 m/s. In addition, the SCP-ATP filling with different proportions of acetone has also been investigated for pouch battery module, indicating that 50% acetone exhibited a better heat transfer effect than the 30% one. Therefore, this research would provide a significant value in the design and optimization of thermal management systems for battery module.",International Journal of Energy Research

Hybrid Protective Layer for Stable Sodium Metal Anodes at High Utilization,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Na metal is a promising anode for Na batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and low reduction potential. Nevertheless, an unstable and inhomogeneous solid electrolyte interphase originated from the instantaneous reactions between the Na metal anode and organic liquid electrolyte causes the intractable hurdles of dendrite growth and low Coulombic efficiency. Here, a sodium fluoride (NaF)-poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) inorganic-organic hybrid protective layer is constructed on a commercial Cu current collector via a simple blade-coating technique. A flexible PVDF matrix can endure volume change, maintaining the integrity of the anode/coating interface, while NaF particles provide improved Na+ diffusion conductivity and mechanical strength, suppressing the dendrite initiation and growth. Based on these synergetic effects, an excellent cycle life of more than &tild;2100 h is realized at 1 mA cm-2 at 50% depth of discharge (DOD), which outperforms 10-fold lifetime of the Cu current collector (&tild;170 h).

Effect of multi-walled carbon nanotubes addition on MnOx/Ti electrode prepared by spraying–calcination method for electro-catalytic oxidation of Acid Red B,"© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The titanium-based electrodes with MnOx nanoparticles coating (MnOx/Ti) and MnOx nanoparticles mixed with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MnOx–CNTs/Ti) were fabricated by spraying–calcination method. The physicochemical properties of electrodes were investigated by SEM, XRD and XPS, which indicated that the surface coating of MnOx–CNTs/Ti, with MnOx nanoparticles dispersed uniformly on the CNTs, was smoother and with higher integrity than MnOx/Ti. Acid Red B was used as model pollutant to investigate the electro-catalytic activity of the electrodes, and the results revealed that the removal efficiency of Acid Red B reached 93.6% and 98.0% by MnOx/Ti and MnOx–CNTs/Ti, respectively, and the cell potential during the process of degradation by MnOx–CNTs/Ti was relatively low and stable. The electrochemical results confirmed that MnOx–CNTs/Ti possessed smaller charge transfer resistance and higher oxygen evolution current compared with MnOx/Ti, which can enhance the electro-catalytic activity and reduce the energy consumption by accelerating the transfer of electrons on the electrode surface. The accelerated lifetime tests of electrodes were carried out and showed that actual service lifetimes of MnOx–CNTs/Ti were 38 times of that for MnOx/Ti calculated by the experienced formula, which demonstrated that the durability of MnOx-based electrode was significantly promoted by addition of CNTs on Ti substrate.",Journal of Materials Science
Core-shell anatase anode materials for sodium-ion batteries: The impact of oxygen vacancies and nitrogen-doped carbon coating,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.In this work, the impact of oxygen vacancies and nitrogen-doped carbon coating on the sodium-ion storage properties of anatase TiO2 has been demonstrated. Oxygen vacancies and nitrogen-doped carbon coating were introduced simultaneously by the calcination of core-shell structured TiO2 spheres in a reducing atmosphere. Compared to the anatase TiO2 with and without oxygen vacancies, TiO2-x@NC exhibits much better electrochemical performance in the storage of sodium ions. A high reversible capacity of 245.6 mA h g-1 is maintained at 0.1 A g-1 after 200 cycles, and a high specific capacity of 155.6 mA h g-1 is achieved at a high rate of 5.0 A g-1. The significantly improved electrochemical performance of the core-shell structured anatase TiO2 spheres is attributed to the synergistic effect of the oxygen vacancies in the anatase lattice and surface nitrogen-doped carbon coating. This work provides an efficient strategy for improving the electrochemical performance of metal-oxide-based electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",Nanoscale

An updated review of energy storage systems: Classification and applications in distributed generation power systems incorporating renewable energy resources,"© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The demand of electric energy is increasing globally, and the fact remains that the major share of this energy is still being produced from the traditional generation technologies. However, the recent trends, for obvious reasons of environmental concerns, are indicating a paradigm shift towards distributed generation (DG) incorporating renewable energy resources (RERs). But there are associated challenges with high penetration of RERs as these resources are unpredictable and stochastic in nature, and as a result, it becomes difficult to provide immediate response to demand variations. This is where energy storage systems (ESSs) come to the rescue, and they not only can compensate the stochastic nature and sudden deficiencies of RERs but can also enhance the grid stability, reliability, and efficiency by providing services in power quality, bridging power, and energy management. This paper provides an extensive review of different ESSs, which have been in use and also the ones that are currently in developing stage, describing their working principles and giving a comparative analysis of important features and technical as well as economic characteristics. The wide range of storage technologies, with each ESS being different in terms of the scale of power, response time, energy/power density, discharge duration, and cost coupled with the complex characteristics matrices, makes it difficult to select a particular ESS for a specific application. The comparative analysis presented in this paper helps in this regard and provides a clear picture of the suitability of ESSs for different power system applications, categorized appropriately. The paper also brings out the associated challenges and suggests the future research directions.",International Journal of Energy Research
High Capacity and Superior Cyclic Performances of All-Solid-State Lithium-Sulfur Batteries Enabled by a High-Conductivity Li10SnP2S12 Solid Electrolyte,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.All-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) employing sulfide-based solid electrolytes have gained widespread attention for their high energy density and intrinsic safety. Li10SnP2S12 is identified as one of the most rivaling candidates in sulfide electrolytes. Herein, a highly Li-ion-conductive Li10SnP2S12 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) is synthesized via a combination of high-energy ball-milling and heat treatment processes, which is more facile and efficient compared with other previously reported methods. The obtained Li10SnP2S12 SSE exhibits high ionic conductivity (3.2 × 10-3 S cm-1) at room temperature (RT). The effects of the annealing temperature on the Li-ion conductivity and activation energy of Li10SnP2S12 are also thoroughly studied. Moreover, the ASSLSBs based on the Li10SnP2S12 electrolyte are constructed, and they deliver a high initial capacity of 1601.7 mAh g-1 at 40 mA g-1. A favorable capacity retention upon cycling and a good rate performance are also achieved at RT. Concomitantly, the Coulombic efficiency approaches 100% during the prolonged cycling.

Synthesis and Ionic Conductivity of NaZr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3 – x,"© 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.Abstract: Arsenate phosphates NaZr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3 – x are synthesized by the sol–gel method with subsequent annealing at 1123 K. Thus obtained specimens are investigated using X-ray diffraction analysis, IR and impedance spectroscopy. In the NaZr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3 – x system, continuous solid solution (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) with NaZr2(PO4)3 (NASICON) structure forms. According to the impedance spectroscopy data, an increase of the content of arsenic in the NaZr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3 – x system leads to an increase of the sodium-ionic conductivity; for NaZr2(AsO4)3, it reaches 8 × 10–5 S/cm at 773 K. At the same time, the activation energy of conductivity of this material (50 ± 1 kJ/mol) appears to be twice lower than the activation energy of conductivity of NaZr2(PO4)3 (100 ± 1 kJ/mol).",Russian Journal of Electrochemistry
An integrated structural air electrode based on parallel porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube arrays for rechargeable li–air batteries,"© 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The poor discharge and charge capacities, and the cycle performance of current Li–air batteries represent critical obstacles to their practical application. The fabrication of an integrated structural air electrode with stable parallel micropore channels and excellent electrocatalytic activity is an effcient strategy for solving these problems. Herein, a novel approach involving the synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (N-CNT) arrays on a carbon paper substrate with a conductive carbon-black layer for use as the air electrode is presented. This design achieves faster oxygen, lithium ion, and electron transfer, which allows higher oxygen reduction/evolution reaction activities. As a result, the N-CNT arrays (N/C = 1:20) deliver distinctly higher discharge and charge capacities, 2203 and 186 mAh g- 1, than those of active carbons with capacities of 497 and 71 mAh g- 1 at 0.05 mA cm- 2, respectively. A theoretical analysis of the experimental results shows that the parallel micropore channels of the air electrode decrease oxygen diffusion resistance and lithium ion transfer resistance, enhancing the discharge and charge capacities and cycle performance of Li–air batteries. Additionally, the N-CNT arrays with a high pyridinic nitrogen content can decompose the lithium peroxide product and recover the electrode morphology, thereby further improving the discharge–charge performance of Li–air batteries.",Nanomaterials

Designing solid-state interfaces on lithium-metal anodes: a review,"© 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Li-metal anodes are one of the most promising energy storage systems that can considerably exceed the current technology to meet the ever-increasing demand of power applications. The apparent cycling performances and dendrite challenges of Li-metal anodes are highly influenced by the interface layer on the Li-metal anode because the intrinsic high reactivity of metallic Li results in an inevitable solid-state interface layer between the Li-metal and electrolytes. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on the interfacial chemistry regarding the interactions between electrolytes and ion migration through dynamic interfaces. The critical factors that affect the interface formation for constructing a stable interface with a low resistance are reviewed. Moreover, we review emerging strategies for rationally designing multiple-structured solid-state electrolytes and their interfaces, including the interfacial properties within hybrid electrolytes and the solid electrolyte/electrode interface. Finally, we present scientific issues and perspectives associated with Li-metal anode interfaces toward a practical Li-metal battery.",Science China Chemistry
Rechargeable Iron–Sulfur Battery without Polysulfide Shuttling,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSulfur represents one of the most promising cathode materials for next-generation batteries; however, the widely observed polysulfide dissolution/shuttling phenomenon in metal–sulfur redox chemistries has severely restricted their applications. Here it is demonstrated that when pairing the sulfur electrode with the iron metal anode, the inherent insolubility of iron sulfides renders the shuttling-free nature of the Fe–S electrochemical reactions. Consequently, the sulfur electrode exhibits promising performance for Fe2+ storage, where a high capacity of ≈1050 mAh g−1, low polarization of ≈0.16 V as well as stable cycling of 150 cycles are realized. The Fe–S redox mechanism is further revealed as an intriguing stepwise conversion of S8 ↔ FeS2 ↔ Fe3S4 ↔ FeS, where a low volume expansion of ≈32.6% and all-solid-state phase transitions facilitate the reaction reversibility. This study suggests an alternative direction to exploit sulfur electrodes in rechargeable transition metal–sulfur batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials
On the Reversibility and Fragility of Sodium Metal Electrodes,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimMetallic sodium is receiving renewed interest as a battery anode material because the metal is earth-abundant, inexpensive, and offers a high specific storage capacity (1166 mAh g−1 at −2.71 V vs the standard hydrogen potential). Unlike metallic lithium, the case for Na as the anode in rechargeable batteries has already been demonstrated on a commercial scale in high-temperature Na||S and Na||NiCl2 secondary batteries, which increases interest. The reversibility of room temperature sodium anodes is investigated in galvanostatic plating/stripping reactions using in situ optical visualization and galvanostatic polarization measurements. It is discovered that electronic disconnection of mossy metallic Na deposits (“orphaning”) is a dominant source of anode irreversibility in liquid electrolytes. The disconnection is shown by means of direct visualization studies to be triggered by a root-breakage process during the stripping cycle. As a further step toward electrode designs that are able to accommodate the fragile Na deposits, electrodeposition of Na is demonstrated in nonplanar electrode architectures, which provide continuous and morphology agnostic access to the metal at all stages of electrochemical cycling. On this basis, nonplanar Na electrodes are reported, which exhibit exceptionally high levels of reversibility (Coulombic efficiency >99.6% for 1 mAh cm−2 Na throughput) in room-temperature, liquid electrolytes.",Advanced Energy Materials
High-Performance Sodium-Ion Battery Anode via Rapid Microwave Carbonization of Natural Cellulose Nanofibers with Graphene Initiator,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimCellulose is a promising natural bio-macromolecule due to its abundance, renewability and low cost. Here, a new method is developed to prepare pre-sodiated carbonaceous anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) under microwave irradiation for potential ultrafast and large-scale manufacturing. While direct carbonization of CNFs through microwave treatment is usually impossible due to the weak microwave absorption of CNFs, it is found that a small amount of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can act as an effective initiator. Microwaving rGO releases extremely high energy, giving rise to local ultrahigh temperature as well as ultrahigh heating rate, which then induces the fast carbonization of CNFs and the production of pre-sodiated carbonaceous materials within seconds. The sodium in the carbonaceous materials, introduced from the carbonization of CNFs containing sodium-ion carboxyl, offer favorable spaces for sodiation/desodiation, which improves the electrochemical performance of the sodium-inserted carbonaceous anode. When the microwaved rGO-CNF (MrGO-CNF) is used as an anode for SIBs, a high initial capacity of 558 mAh g−1 is delivered and the capacity of 340 mAh g−1 remains after 200 cycles. The excellent reversible capacity and cycling stability indicate MrGO-CNF a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries.",Small
A Versatile Pyramidal Hauerite Anode in Congeniality Diglyme-Based Electrolytes for Boosting Performance of Li- and Na-Ion Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimFor the first time, environmentally friendly sulfur-rich pyramidal MnS2 synthesized via a single-step hydrothermal process is used as a high-performance anode material in Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. The superior electrochemical performance of the MnS2 electrode along with its high compatibility with ether-based electrolytes are analyzed in both half- and full-cell configurations. The reversible capacities of ≈84 mAh g−1 and ≈74 mAh g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 are retained in the Li-ion and Na-ion full-cells, respectively, over 200 cycles with excellent capacity retentions. Moreover, important findings regarding activation processes in the presence of a new phase transition and protective electrolyte interphase layer are revealed using ab initio density function theory calculation and in situ potentio-electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The detailed complex redox mechanism of MnS2 in Li/Na half-cells is also elucidated by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.",Advanced Energy Materials
Single Nickel Atoms on Nitrogen-Doped Graphene Enabling Enhanced Kinetics of Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have arousing interest because of their high theoretical energy density. However, they often suffer from sluggish conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) during the charge/discharge process. Single nickel (Ni) atoms on nitrogen-doped graphene (Ni@NG) with Ni–N4 structure are prepared and introduced to modify the separators of Li–S batteries. The oxidized Ni sites of the Ni–N4 structure act as polysulfide traps, efficiently accommodating polysulfide ion electrons by forming strong Sx 2−⋅⋅⋅NiN bonding. Additionally, charge transfer between the LiPS and oxidized Ni sites endows the LiPS on Ni@NG with low free energy and decomposition energy barrier in an electrochemical process, accelerating the kinetic conversion of LiPS during the charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the large binding energy of LiPS on Ni@NG also shows its ability to immobilize the LiPS and further suppresses the undesirable shuttle effect. Therefore, a Li–S battery based on a Ni@NG modified separator exhibits excellent rate performance and stable cycling life with only 0.06% capacity decay per cycle. It affords fresh insights for developing single-atom catalysts to accelerate the kinetic conversion of LiPS for highly stable Li–S batteries.",Advanced Materials
Boosting the Reversibility of Sodium Metal Anode via Heteroatom-Doped Hollow Carbon Fibers,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium (Na) metal anodes stand out with their remarkable capacity and natural abundance. However, the dendritic Na growth, infinite dimensional changes, and low Coulombic efficiency (CE) present key bottlenecks plaguing practical applications. Here, heteroatom-doped (nitrogen, sulfur) hollow carbon fibers (D-HCF) are rationally synthesized as a nucleation-assisting host to enable a highly reversible Na metal. The “sodiophilic” functional groups introduced by the heteroatom-doping and large surface area (≈1052 m2 g−1) synchronously contribute to a homogenous plating morphology with dissipated local current density. High “sodiophilicity” of the D-HCF is confirmed by first-principle calculations and experimental results, where strong adsorption energy of −3.52 eV with low Na+ nucleation overpotential of 3.2 mV at 0.2 mA cm−2 is realized. As such, highly reversible plating/stripping is achieved at 1.0 mA cm−2 with average CE approximating 99.52% over 600 cycles. The as-assembled Na@D-HCF symmetric cells exhibit a prolonged lifetime for 1000 h. A full-cell paired with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode further demonstrates stable electrochemical behavior for 200 cycles at 1 C along with excellent rate performance (102 mAh g−1 at 5 C). The results clearly show the effectiveness of the D-HCF in manipulating Na+ deposition and thus the significance of nucleation control in realizing dendrite-free metal anodes.",Small
Li-Breathing Air Batteries Catalyzed by MnNiFe/Laser-Induced Graphene Catalysts,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe development of efficient bifunctional catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) is important in the development of rechargeable metal–O2 (air) batteries. Here, a straightforward synthesis of highly efficient bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts MnNiFe/LIG (M111/LIG and M311/LIG where the numbers reflect the relative molar ratio of Mn, Ni, and Fe species) is presented through a facile re-lasing method. The MnNiFe/LIG shows promising performance in Li–O2 and Li–air batteries without the presence of a redox mediator. The Li–O2 battery with M311/LIG catalysts is reliably discharged and charged for 150 cycles while the discharge potential slightly increases by 0.24 V. The Li-breathing air battery with M311/LIG catalyst is stable during 350 cycles while the Li-breathing air battery with M111/LIG catalyst is stable for ≈300 cycles. The function of the M111/LIG and M311/LIG catalysts in the Li–O2 batteries and the influence of the catalysts on the discharge and decomposition products are also investigated. This study promotes further development in carbon–metal oxide composite cathode catalysts for metal–air batteries and underscores the efficacy of laser-induced graphene for electrode fabrications.",Advanced Materials Interfaces
Macroscopic modelling of the discharge behaviour of sodium air flow battery,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdMetal air batteries are the promising alternative to power electric vehicles in future. However, they suffer from mass transfer limitations at the higher discharge rates. The use of flow batteries can provide higher specific energies at the higher discharge rates. The flow batteries incorporating sodium as the anode material provides less expensive energy storage option compared to the lithium based flow batteries. In the current study, we focus on the discharge behaviour of the sodium air flow battery. A detailed parametric study is carried out to investigate the influence of the different operating variables such as the discharge current density and the pressure gradient. We identify the distribution of the oxygen concentration through the cell to be the critical parameter relating to the cell performance. Further, we demonstrate that the advantage of using flow configuration compared to the non-flow configuration becomes apparent beyond a critical current density as the parasitic power consumption for obtaining forced convection dominates over the low current density regime. Moreover, the optimal pressure gradient strongly depends on the desired rate of discharge. The inferences presented in the current paper are essential in terms of understanding and designing the futuristic sodium air flow batteries.",Journal of Energy Storage
Preparation and electrochemical properties of nickel–manganese composite sulfide,"© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Nickel–manganese sulfide microspheres were prepared with the electrodepositon method, and the supercapacitive properties of this substance as composite electrode materials were explored. Pretreated nickel foam and thiourea were used as the substrate and sulfur source, respectively. Deposition duration was the main factor affecting the morphology of the material, and the degree of morphological dispersion affected the electrochemical properties. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) techniques were used to investigate the electrochemical properties of the material. The highest specific capacitance was determined to be 2076 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 when the deposition time was 5 min, the thiourea concentration was 0.2 M, the nickel to manganese ratio was 1:3, and the deposition potential was − 1.1 V. The specific capacitance retention of the material was 48.5% after 1000 cycles at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.",Ionics
Structural and electrochemical studies of undoped and In3+-doped co-binary Cu2-xTe and Bi2Te3 thin films for aqueous Na–S batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.WO3 electrodes coated with co-binary Cu2-xTe and Bi2Te3 thin films were fabricated for sodium-sulfur (Na–S) batteries. Film fabrication was controlled by adjusting the pH of the solution and the indium doping concentration. The phases of orthorhombic CuTe and hexagonal Cu2Te with rhombohedral Bi2Te3 were formed on the WO3 electrode. After In3+ doping, In3+ ions act as Frenkel defects in the Cu2-xTe structure. This indicated that In3+ ions are located at interstitial sites in the Cu2-xTe structure with higher defect creation energy. Furthermore, more interconnected-like nanoparticles and reduced porosity were observed, thereby indicating that indium segregation with grain boundaries presented and contributed to an enhancement of the surface mobility, nucleation density, and a smoother surface. For electrochemical characteristics, a polysulfide solution was used as a redox electrolyte for ion transport. Optimization of the pH and indium concentration attributed to improve the exchange current density (J0) and time responses for the colored and bleached states because of faster movement of Na+ and S2− ions during inter/de-intercalation. Furthermore, optimization of the electrode by adjusting the pH and doping with indium is advantageous for both Na–S and rechargeable batteries because of long life cycle, reasonably high power and energy density of 306 W/kg and 9.35 Wh/kg, respectively. The highest specific capacity (Cs) values of the charge and discharge cycles for In3+-doped electrodes are ∼ 21 and 19 mAh/g, respectively with the coulombic efficiency approximates 100% (average value of ∼96%). This approach may provide a general path for the fabrication of undoped and In3+-doped co-binary Cu2-xTe and Bi2Te3 films on WO3 electrodes and may increase our knowledge regarding Na–S batteries for further performance improvement.",Ceramics International
Toward a low-cost high-voltage sodium aqueous rechargeable battery,"© 2019 The AuthorsRecent discovery of high-concentration electrolyte systems has opened a new avenue toward the high-voltage, safe, and low-cost aqueous rechargeable batteries. However, the need for generally high-cost organic solutes in the high-concentration electrolyte has become another major obstacle. Herein, we revisited all the commonly used low-cost solutes for high-concentration system and discovered that the use of NaClO4 solute effectively results in a wide electrochemical stability window by suppressing water decomposition and induces stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formation without involving the reduction of salt anions. The SEI layer, composed of Na2CO3 and Na[sbnd]O compounds including NaOH, guarantees the excellent electrochemical storage stability of the full-cell composed of Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) cathode and NaTi2(PO4)3 anode for the extended period of time. This new class of electrolyte systems provides remarkable cycle stability and a coulombic efficiency of ∼99% at 1C for over 200 cycles, which outperforms the state-of-the-art super-concentrated systems based on NaCF3SO3.",Materials Today

Here, we investigate the key parameters required to achieve single-step scalable synthesis of Na3PS4 solid electrolyte from its starting precursors. We determine that Na3PS4 solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity (∼0.2 mS cm−1) can be easily achieved in 20 min using a single synthesis step, representing a significant improvement over other existing energy-intensive multiple-step methods. The all solid-state battery constructed with this highly conductive Na3PS4 is able to deliver 185 mAh g−1 capacity on the first discharge and excellent rate performance with a TiS2 cathode and a Na15Sn4 anode.",Journal of Power Sources
Nitrogen and Sulfur Co-doped Mesoporous Carbon for Sodium Ion Batteries,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Enhanced sodium ion storage capacity of carbon anodes can be realized by heteroatom doping. Designing doped carbons with superior rate performance, high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), and excellent cyclability is still vital for practical application of sodium ion batteries. Herein, nitrogen and sulfur co-doped mesoporous carbons have been successfully synthesized from rhodanine using SBA-15 as the template, and the doped carbons exhibit ultrahigh ICE of 90.9%, show superior rate performance with a high capacity of 236 mA h g-1 tested at 10 A g-1, and maintain 88% of their initial capacity even after 5000 cycles in ether-based electrolyte. High nitrogen and sulfur co-doping level, interconnected mesoporous structure, and optimized electrolyte ensure rapid electron/ion transfer. The kinetics analysis indicates that ultrahigh capacitive contribution of 84.5% at 0.2 mV s-1 and 93.9% at 1 mV s-1 can be achieved. Ex situ XPS analysis indicates that heteroatom doping can introduce irreversible capacity, and the functional groups should be strictly controlled for boosting the electrochemical performance. These results open a promising avenue to realize advanced carbon anodes for sodium ion storage by doping with ether-based electrolyte.",ACS Applied Nano Materials
Na2S sacrificial cathodic material for high performance sodium-ion capacitors,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdSodium sulfide (Na2S) has been used as sacrificial material for the presodiation of a Sn4P3 negative electrode in order to realize a high-performance sodium-ion capacitor (NIC). In two-electrode cells with Na counter/reference electrode and 1 mol L−1 NaClO4 electrolyte, sodium could be irreversibly extracted from Na2S at potential lower than 3.8 V vs. Na/Na+, with a capacity close to the theoretical value of 687 mAh g−1. In the realization of the composite positive electrode for a NIC, the relatively high capacity of Na2S allows to reduce its amount to 40 wt%, whereas the other materials are activated carbon (AC, 40 wt%), carbon soot (15 wt%) and binder (5 wt%). Once the pre-sodiation of Sn4P3 is completed, activated carbon being a part of the positive electrode stores charges in the electrical double-layer (EDL), while reversible sodium insertion occurs in the Sn4P3 negative electrode. The full NIC demonstrates stable performance in the voltage range 2.0 V–3.8 V with high specific energy ca. 48 Wh kg−1 at specific power of 1 kW kg−1 (per total mass of electrodes). Hence, Na2S is an excellent sacrificial material, which allows the NICs construction to be simplified and consequently the manufacturing costs to be reduced.",Electrochimica Acta

In addition, power density, energy density, and cycle life of these metal-Air batteries can be improved further by utilizing the fast faradaic reactions of metal ions in the catalyst layer together with the oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR) for charge storage. In this work, we propose mixed metal phosphates of nickel and cobalt, NixCo3-x(PO4)2 (x = 0,1, 1.5, 2, and 3), as multifunctional air-cathodes exhibiting bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and reversible metal redox reaction (M3+/2+, M = Ni and Co). Submicron-sized NixCo3-x(PO4)2 particles were synthesized by a solution combustion synthesis technique with urea acting as the fuel. Electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M NaOH was systematically tuned by varying the Ni-To-Co ratio. The synthesized NixCo3-x(PO4)2 with x = 1.5 (NCP11) showed superior bifunctional catalytic activity to other samples. Moreover, the catalyst material delivered a specific capacity of â 110 mAh g-1 by the redox reactions of its metal sites. The hybrid Na-Air battery fabricated using the NCP11 catalyst-loaded air-cathode exhibited low overpotential, stable cycling performance, and round-Trip energy efficiency exceeding 78% in a 0.1 M NaOH aqueous electrolyte.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
A Sodium Storage Material Based on Chamber-Confined Conversion of Co9S8 Nanorod Encapsulated by N-Doped Carbon Shell,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Different from the ion intercalation/deintercalation, conversion-based reactions are a promising way to achieve high capacity of storage materials. However, their too much volume change and poor reversibility during discharge/charge are stubborn to overcome. Herein, by combining hydrothermal synthesis and chemical vapor deposition, a Co9S8 nanorod encapsulated by a N-doped carbon shell (r-Co9S8@NC) is built and applied as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries. Benefiting from the advantages of the chamber-confined conversion and sodiophilic interface offered by the N-doped carbon shell, the Co9S8 redox was well restrained in the shell with improved kinetics, which can not only alleviate the Co9S8/electrolyte side reaction and suppress the large volume expansion and aggregation of Co9S8 nanorods but also enhance the sodium storage/diffusion ability. As expected, the r-Co9S8@NC electrodes exhibit a high capacity of 675 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, an excellent rate capability (342 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1), and a good cycling stability (317 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles at 5 A g-1 and 483 mAh g-1 after 150 cycles at 500 mA g-1) among which the rate capability is outperforming most of the reported metal-sulfide-based anodes. Further, the sodium storage mechanism and the good reversibility of the r-Co9S8@NC electrode have been revealed and confirmed by the XRD and XPS characterizations. This work provides an effective strategy to design storage materials based on a chamber-confined conversion reaction.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering

Polymer Electrolytes for Lithium-Based Batteries: Advances and Prospects,"© 2019 Elsevier Inc.Polymer electrolytes have attracted great interest for next-generation lithium (Li)-based batteries in terms of high energy density and safety. In this review, we summarize the ion-transport mechanisms, fundamental properties, and preparation techniques of various classes of polymer electrolytes, such as solvent-free polymer electrolytes (SPEs), gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs), and composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). We also introduce the recent advances of non-aqueous Li-based battery systems, in which their performances can be intrinsically enhanced by polymer electrolytes.

Stable and Unstable Diglyme-Based Electrolytes for Batteries with Sodium or Graphite as Electrode,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.We study the stability of several diglyme-based electrolytes in sodium|sodium and sodium|graphite cells. The electrolyte behavior for different conductive salts [sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaOTf), NaPF6, NaClO4, bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI), and sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI)] is compared and, in some cases, considerable differences are identified. Side reactions are studied with a variety of methods, including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, online electrochemical mass spectrometry, and in situ electrochemical dilatometry. For Na|Na symmetric cells as well as for Na|graphite cells, we find that NaOTf and NaPF6 are the preferred salts followed by NaClO4 and NaFSI, as the latter two lead to more side reactions and increasing impedance. NaTFSI shows the worst performance leading to poor Coulombic efficiency and cycle life. In this case, excessive side reactions lead also to a strong increase in electrode thickness during cycling. In a qualitative order, the suitability of the conductive salts can be ranked as follows: NaOTf ≥ NaPF6 > NaClO4 > NaFSI ≫ NaTFSI. Our results also explain two recent, seemingly conflicting findings on the degree of solid electrolyte interphase formation on graphite electrodes in sodium-ion batteries [ Maibach, J.; et al. ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2017, 9, 12373-12381; Goktas, M.; et al. Adv. Energy Mater. 2018, 8, 1702724[. The contradictory findings are due to the different conductive salts used in both studies.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Turbostratic carbon-localised FeS2 nanocrystals as anodes for high-performance sodium-ion batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Low-cost metal sulfides are promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs); however, they suffer from sluggish kinetics and large volume expansion upon cycling. Here, a strategy to grow FeS2 on turbostratic carbon (t-carbon) assisted by chemical interactions between Fe and C electrons was realized via a simple and scalable mechanical alloying (MA) approach with a trace amount of CNTs. The structural change in CNTs synchronized with the in situ growth of FeS2 on the transformed t-carbon during the MA process, forming localised FeS2 nanocrystals wrapped in the frameworks of t-carbon. This intertwined structure within a grain consisted of chemical bonding by electronic hybridization between FeS2 and its adjacent carbon layer, resulting in enhanced structural stability upon cycling. Moreover, the localised FeS2 nanocrystals with an ultrasmall diameter of 10 nm encapsulated in the nanoframeworks of t-carbon could effectively shorten the diffusion paths of electrons/ions and withstand the volume expansion. The as-synthesized FeS2-C hybrid composite electrode exhibited a pseudocapacitive diffusion behavior with high specific capacity, good cycling stability, and remarkable rate capability. This strategy is a facile, scalable, and low-cost route toward high-performance metal sulfide anode materials for the commercial utilization of SIBs.",Nanoscale
Regulating Interfacial Na-Ion Flux via Artificial Layers with Fast Ionic Conductivity for Stable and High-Rate Na Metal Batteries,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Metallic Na electrodes are promising anodes for low-cost and high-energy density batteries due to their natural abundance and high specific capacity. Unfortunately, they are extremely reactive and spontaneously form unstable solid-electrolyte interphases, which lead to critical challenges including growth of dendritic/mossy Na structures and fast degradation. We report here the design of artificial interphase films that have intrinsic high Na+-ion conductivity, which enable protected Na electrodes with simultaneously improved surface stability and redox kinetics. They were prepared from Mo6S8 films, which transform to NaxMo6S8 (x ≈ 16) through an in-situ sodiation process when pressed onto Na metal. The protected Na electrodes were stable in dry air for days and exhibited 2.5 times higher exchange current density compared with pristine Na electrodes. They enabled symmetric batteries with stable cycling for 1200 h at 0.5 mA cm-2 and fast Na metal batteries with substantially improved high-rate performance and robust durability for 1000 cycles.",ACS Materials Letters
Hierarchical Nickel Clusters Encapsulated in Ultrathin N-doped Graphitic Nanocarbon Hybrids for Effective Hydrogen Evolution Reaction,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Three-dimensional (3D) nanospheres with a hollow interior derived from self-sacrificing templates have triggered great enthusiasm due to their structure-related performance for splitting water into hydrogen. Herein, a nickel-organic compound constituted of elemental nickel and glycine was first synthesized through a solvothermal process in an ethyl alcohol solution. Then, novel 3D hierarchical nanocatalysts consisting of ultrathin N-doped graphitic-nanocarbon-coated nickel clusters with a hollow interior structure were facilely fabricated via calcining the prepared nickel-organic compound. Outstanding electrocatalytic activity with a small overpotential of 70 mV and a low Tafel slope of 119 mV dec-1 for the hydrogen evolution reaction process can be readily achieved in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution through a controllable synthesis method. The investigation on electrocatalytic activity certifies that the thickness of the graphitic nanocarbon shells has a great influence on water splitting efficiency for hydrogen; the thinner the graphitic nanocarbon shells, the more excellent the electrocatalytic efficiency. Additionally, the detailed electrochemically active surface area suggests that the 3D hollow structured hybridized electrocatalysts with defect-rich ultrathin graphitic nanocarbon shells could limit the aggregation of nickel clusters, and small electrochemical impedance accelerates the penetration of electrons, inducing a high efficiency for electrochemical water splitting. Therefore, thoughtful design using the self-sacrificing template method provides a promising strategy for the fabrication of other hybridized composites with hierarchical architectures consisting of nanoclusters and nanocarbon for more efficient water splitting.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering

KGaA, WeinheimThe elemental sulfur electrode with Cu2+ as the charge carrier gives a four-electron sulfur electrode reaction through the sequential conversion of S↔CuS↔Cu2S. The Cu-S redox-ion electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 3044 mAh g−1 based on the sulfur mass or 609 mAh g−1 based on the mass of Cu2S, the completely discharged product, and displays an unprecedently high potential of sulfur/metal sulfide reduction at 0.5 V vs. SHE. The Cu-S electrode also exhibits an extremely low extent of polarization of 0.05 V and an outstanding cycle number of 1200 cycles retaining 72 % of the initial capacity at 12.5 A g−1. The remarkable utility of this Cu-S cathode is further demonstrated in a hybrid cell that employs an Zn metal anode and an anion-exchange membrane as the separator, which yields an average cell discharge voltage of 1.15 V, the half-cell specific energy of 547 Wh kg−1 based on the mass of the Cu2S/carbon composite cathode, and stable cycling over 110 cycles.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition

Encapsulation of few-layer MoS2 in the pores of mesoporous carbon hollow spheres for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Integrating a highly conductive carbon host and polar inorganic compounds has been widely reported to improve the electrochemical performances for promising low-cost lithium sulfur batteries. Herein, a MoS2/mesoporous carbon hollow sphere (MoS2/MCHS) structure has been proposed as an efficient sulfur cathode via a simple wet impregnation method and gas phase vulcanization method. Multi-fold structural merits have been demonstrated for the MoS2/MCHS structures. On one hand, the mesoporous carbon hollow sphere (MCHS) matrix, with abundant pore structures and high specific surface areas, could load a large amount of sulfur, improve the electronical conductivity of sulfur electrodes, and suppress the volume changes during the repeated sulfur conversion processes. On the other hand, ultrathin multi-layer MoS2 nanosheets are revealed to be uniformly distributed in the mesoporous carbon hollow spheres, enhancing the physical adsorption and chemical entrapment functionalities towards the soluble polysulfide species. Having benefited from these structural advantages, the sulfur-impregnated MoS2/MCHS cathode presents remarkably improved electrochemical performances in terms of lower voltage polarization, higher reversible capacity (1094.3 mAh g-1), higher rate capability (590.2 mAh g-1 at 2 C), and better cycling stability (556 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles at 2 C) compared to the sulfur-impregnated MCHS cathode.

A first-principles exploration of NaxSy binary phases at 1 atm and under pressure,"© 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Interest in Na-S compounds stems from their use in battery materials at 1 atm, as well as the potential for superconductivity under pressure. Evolutionary structure searches coupled with Density Functional Theory calculations were employed to predict stable and low-lying metastable phases of sodium poor and sodium rich sulfides at 1 atm and within 100-200 GPa. At ambient pressures, four new stable or metastable phases with unbranched sulfur motifs were predicted: Na2S3 with C2/c and Imm2 symmetry, C2-Na2S5 and C2-Na2S8. Van der Waals interactions were shown to affect the energy ordering of various polymorphs. At high pressure, several novel phases that contained a wide variety of zero-, one-, and two-dimensional sulfur motifs were predicted, and their electronic structures and bonding were analyzed. At 200 GPa, P4/mmm-Na2S8 was predicted to become superconducting below 15.5 K, which is close to results previously obtained for the Β-Po phase of elemental sulfur. The structures of the most stable M3S and M4S, M = Na, phases differed from those previously reported for compounds with M = H, Li, K.",Crystals

S-Doped Carbon Fibers Uniformly Embedded with Ultrasmall TiO2 for Na+/Li+ Storage with High Capacity and Long-Time Stability,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimBuilding a rechargeable battery with high capacity, high energy density, and long lifetime contributes to the development of novel energy storage devices in the future. Although carbon materials are very attractive anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), they present several deficiencies when used in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The choice of an appropriate structural design and heteroatom doping are critical steps to improve the capacity and stability. Here, carbon-based nanofibers are produced by sulfur doping and via the introduction of ultrasmall TiO2 nanoparticles into the carbon fibers (CNF-S@TiO2). It is discovered that the introduction of TiO2 into carbon nanofibers can significantly improve the specific surface area and microporous volume for carbon materials. The TiO2 content is controlled to obtain CNF-S@TiO2-5 to use as the anode material for SIBs/LIBs with enhanced electrochemical performance in Na+/Li+ storage. During the charge/discharge process, the S-doping and the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles into carbon fibers promote the insertion/extraction of the ions and enhance the capacity and cycle life. The capacity of CNF-S@TiO2-5 can be maintained at ≈300 mAh g−1 over 600 cycles at 2 A g−1 in SIBs. Moreover, the capacity retention of such devices is 94%, showing high capacity and good stability.",Small
Recent progress on solid-state hybrid electrolytes for solid-state lithium batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Lithium batteries are promising energy storage systems for applications in electric vehicles. However, conventional liquid electrolytes inherit serious safety hazards including leakage, ignition and even explosion upon overheating. Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are considered as the ultimate solution to these safety concerns because of their excellent thermal and electrochemical stabilities. Nevertheless, few individual SSE has reached practical application standards due to incomprehensive performance. High ionic conductivity, low interfacial resistance, and high stability towards electrodes are difficult to achieve simultaneously with an individual SSE. Hybrid electrolytes rationally combining two or more types of SSEs with complementary advantages are promising for building feasible solid-state lithium batteries (SSLBs). Coupling desired soft electrolyte and stiff inorganic SSEs can ensure good electrode wettability, high ionic conductivity, and high mechanical strength to prevent lithium dendrite formation at the same time. In this review, comprehensive perspectives from the broad context of the importance of hybrid electrolytes to subtle design concepts are summarized. This review not only covers the introductory of classifications, synthesis methods, and ionic conductivity mechanism, but also crystallizes the strategies for enhancing the ionic conductivity of hybrid electrolyte, the understandings on the interfacial challenges of the electrolyte/electrolyte and electrolyte/electrode interfaces, and the strategies for building feasible SSLBs with different hybrid electrolyte combinations.",Energy Storage Materials
Hetero-layered MoS2/C composites enabling ultrafast and durable Na storage,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Transition metal dichalcogenides have been considered as promising conversion-type electrode materials in sodium ion batteries, which allow multi-electron redox processes providing high capacities. However, the conversion reaction often leads to dramatic structural degradation of the electrodes during de-/sodiation, which strongly limits their cycle lifetime, achievable capacities and rate performances. To circumvent these obstacles, in this study, we applied an interfacial engineering strategy by constructing a MoS2/C composite with an inter-overlapped hierarchical structure (MoS2-C@C) through a bottom-up synthesis method. With the alternative stacking of MoS2 and carbon layers, MoS2-C@C provides an ideal environment to maintain the MoS2 structure through the van de Waals interaction within the multilayers. At the same time, the heterointerfaces in MoS2-C@C offer abundant electron transfer pathways. Consequently, the MoS2-C@C electrode exhibits prominently improved electrochemical performance including a high reversible capacity of 590 mA h g−1, a superior cycling stability up to 1000 cycles and an excellent rate capability (164 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1 and 51 mA h g−1 at 50 A g−1). The fast kinetics and high reversibility of the hetero-layered MoS2/C composite for Na storage demonstrate the feasibility of this synthetic strategy to prevent the structural degradation of the conversion-type battery materials.",Energy Storage Materials
Ag–Co Electrocatalysts for Rechargeable Lithium–O2 Batteries: O2 Pressure and Current Density Effects,"© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.In this study, we evaluated the Ag–Co alloy as a catalyst in the Li–O2 battery electrode aiming to improve the electrochemical performance of the energy system. Ag–Co alloys were obtained by cyclic voltammetry from an electrolytic bath. The influence of O2 pressure (1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 atm) and current density (25, 50, and 75 μA cm−2) on the charge and discharge on the cell were studied. It was observed that a medium value of O2 pressure and current density was favorable to obtain a high capacity. Energy-dispersive X-ray presented that the cyclic voltammetry technique did not favor cobalt deposition. Scanning electron microscopy showed homogeneity of the deposits with the presence of cracks and small crystals. X-ray diffraction evidenced Li2O as well as the Raman spectra for nickel foam electrode. Oxygen evolution reaction was improved with Ag–Co catalyst according to linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry analysis. Steel mesh electrode showed higher discharge capacity (336 mAh gc −1) when compared with nickel foam (115 mAh gc −1) which suggests that materials with lower cost can be used as electrodes in Li–O2 batteries.

Designing room temperature sodium sulfur batteries with long cycle-life at pouch cell level,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The successful transfer of room temperature sodium sulfur (RT-Na-S) technology from coin cell to pouch cell level is demonstrated. The general cell design is based on a previously developed RT-Na-S concept implementing hard carbon based anodes. Scalable technologies known from lithium ion battery production are utilized for electrode production. The electrolyte composition, the voltage window as well as the balancing is evaluated on coin cell level leading to optimized parameters. For scaled electrodes and electrolytes, a specific capacity of 418 mAh gS −1 coupled with a high coulombic efficiency of 95.3% can be still obtained in RT-Na-S coin cells after a total of 549 cycles. Residual carbonates in the HC-anode were found to deteriorate the cycling performance. An increased cut-off voltage (1.5 V) significantly raises the coulombic efficiency. Finally, the design is successfully transferred to a 10-layered pouch cell leading to a high energy efficiency of 88.6% and a capacity of 387 mAh gS −1 after a total of 937 cycles. Hence, the present work shows the principle feasibility of a stationary energy storage technology based on RT-Na-S pouch cell technology.",Energy Storage Materials
Thermally etched porous carbon cloth catalyzed by metal organic frameworks as sulfur hosts for lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdActivated carbon cloth (CC)plays vital roles in the fabrication of flexible energy devices, structured supports for catalysts, and CO2 capturer, etc. In terms of the conventional processing methods of activated CC, KOH and CO2 are the representative activation agents. Based on the idea of waiving the use of concentrated alkali and specialty gases, we demonstrate herein a highly efficient and previously unreported method of CC activation with a two-step procedure: homogeneous growth of metal organic frameworks (MOFs)on CC and subsequent activation catalyzed by the MOF derivatives. During pyrolysis, the MOF structures are transformed into Co3O4 particles, which react with carbon, leading to etching of the carbon fiber. This method can be used to form activated CC with coexistence of micropores, mesopores, and macropores. With the benefit of such hierarchical and unique structures, a free-standing sulfur-impregnated porous CC electrode demonstrates obvious advantages over CC-supported sulfur melt or sulfur slurry electrodes, which demonstrates great feasibility of MOF catalyzing porosification of CC for practical applications. This reported method not only broadens the scope of application of MOFs, it could also be further used to create hierarchical structures on other carbonaceous materials in various fields.",Carbon
"Nitrogen, phosphorus co-doped mesoporous carbon materials as efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction","© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Carbon, phosphorus or nitrogen-doped carbon and nitrogen, and phosphorus co-doped carbon materials were successfully synthesized. The scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope indicated that the samples exhibited three-dimensional layered structure. While the X-ray diffraction and Raman results suggested that the samples were typical carbon materials with high purity, besides, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm results showed that the nitrogen, phosphorus co-doped carbon material had the highest specific surface area of 2346.2 m2 g−1 with uniform mesoporous (3.8 nm) and considerable pore volume (0.69 cm3 g−1). The cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectra, liner sweep voltammetry, and chronoamperometry were tested in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The electrochemical tests suggested that the nitrogen, phosphorus co-doped carbon material had a positive onset potential (0.92 V), half-wave potential (0.81 V), low resistance (73 Ω), and low Tafel slope (70 mV/decade) at low current region. More importantly, the oxygen reduction reaction was a 4-electron pathway with excellent methanol tolerance.",Ionics
The ionic resistance and chemical stability of polycrystalline K-β″ alumina in aqueous solutions at room temperature,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Interfaces between alkali metal solid state electrolytes and aqueous solutions are often unstable. In particular, the use of β/β″ alumina superionic conductors is generally limited to conditions absent of liquid water due to their well-known sensitivity to water vapor. However, the degradation mechanism upon exposure to aqueous solutions is not well understood. Using impedance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and chemical analysis, we studied the mechanism of ionic impedance rise for K+-ion-conducting, polycrystalline K-β″ alumina membranes in room temperature aqueous solutions. By using a non-blocking Fe2+/Fe3+ couple in a symmetric aqueous impedance cell with different concentrations of LiOH, NaOH, KOH, CsOH, and KBr, we find that the rate of resistance rise of the membrane is highly dependent on the pH and K+ concentration in the solution. We find the rate decreases from ~50–200 Ω cm2 h−1 in neutral pH solutions to ~0.1–1 Ω cm2 h−1 in alkaline solutions or solutions with high K+ concentrations. Characterization results are consistent with ion exchange of K+ for hydrated protons as the mechanism of resistance rise.",Solid State Ionics
Hierarchical micro-mesoporous carbon prepared from waste cotton textile for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.As the next generation battery, the lithium-sulfur battery with high theoretical specific capacity and energy density needs to overcome the low practical discharge capacity and the poor cycle performance for the poor conductivity of sulfur and the shuttle effect of polysulfide. In this study, a hierarchical micro-mesoporous carbon (HPC) is designed and synthesized as a sulfur host from the cotton textile with KOH activation at 700 °C to combine the advantages of these two structures, where mesoporous structure can improve the infiltration of electrolyte to act as fast ionic channel and micropores have an excellent ability of binding sulfur. The HPC showed an excellent high specific surface area (2835.47 m2 g−1) and a high pore volume (2.82 cm3 g−1), and the ratio of the mesoporous reaches 57.85%. The sulfur in HPC/S was uniformly distributed in the host structure and no surface crystallization was observed by TEM characterization. Assembled in the lithium-sulfur battery, the cathode mixed with HPC/S and conductive agent delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1577 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, and a reversible capacity of 434.5 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at the current rate of 1C.",Ionics
Boron-phosphide monolayer as a potential anchoring material for lithium-sulfur batteries: A first-principles study,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.In recent years, lithium-sulfur (Li[sbnd]S)batteries have attracted tremendous attention as a promising candidate for the next generation recharged battery because of the high theoretical capacity and theoretical specific energy density. However, the severe shuttle effect and poor conductivity of polysulfides greatly hinder the practical application of Li[sbnd]S batteries. In this study, we have employed the first-principles calculations to propose a promising anchoring material of boron-phosphide (BP)monolayer for Li[sbnd]S batteries. The anchoring behaviors and electronic properties of lithium polysulfides on the BP monolayer have been investigated. The results verify that the BP monolayer can be regarded as a moderate anchoring material because the adsorption energy of the polysulfide species on the BP monolayer is in the range of 0.57–2.85 eV. Such a moderate anchoring material is suggested to be the best choice for battery electrode. By analyzing the components of van der Waals, electrostatic and chemical interactions, the complicated anchoring mechanisms are explored. Furthermore, the adsorption of lithium polysulfides can reduce the band gap of BP monolayer, exhibiting enhanced performance of electronic conductivity. Our results of the good anchoring performance and the enhanced electronic conductivity suggest that the BP monolayer has great promise as a cathode anchoring material for Li[sbnd]S batteries, which could inspire more experimental and theoretical studies to explore and develop the potential of other 2D sheets in energy storage systems.",Applied Surface Science
Li-Ion Capacitor Integrated with Nano-network-Structured Ni/NiO/C Anode and Nitrogen-Doped Carbonized Metal-Organic Framework Cathode with High Power and Long Cyclability,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) represent a new type of energy-storage devices, which have combined merits of high energy density Li-ion battery and high power density supercapacitor. Nevertheless, one significant challenge for LICs is the imbalanced kinetics between the fast capacitive cathode and relatively slow intercalation anode that limit the energy-storage performance. Here, the asymmetric LIC devices were developed based on a nitrogen-doped, carbonized zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) cathode and a three-dimensional, nano-network-structured, conversion reaction-based Ni/NiO/C anode. These nanostructures associated with both the cathode and anode enable rapid electron and ions transport in the LIC devices, which allows the asymmetric LICs to be operated on either high energy mode (energy density of 114.7 Wh/kg at power density of 98.0 W/kg) or high power mode (power density of 60.1 kW/kg at energy density of 17.6 Wh/kg). The device also exhibited long-term cycle stability with 87% capacitance retention after 12 000 cycles. These results demonstrate that the rational design of nanoporous electrode structures can deliver a balanced, high-performance-activated cZIF-8|Ni/NiO/C-based lithium-ion capacitor.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Hierarchical porous Fe/N doped carbon nanofibers as host materials for high sulfur loading Li-S batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Improving the sulfur utilization and cycling stability especially under high sulfur loading (>2 mg cm-2) is challenging due to the poor conductivity of sulfur and high soluble nature of polysulfides. Herein, we develop novel self-supporting carbon nanofibers with hierarchical porous structures and Fe/N absorption/nucleation centers (Fe/N-HPCNF) as high performance sulfur hosts via a facile co-spinning method. The highly interior porous carbon fiber structure provides good electrolyte infiltration, stable conductive networks and sufficient surfaces for fast Li+/electron transport and sulfur redox while maintaining high sulfur area loading. In addition, the abundant Fe/N heteroatoms evenly dispersed in the fiber strongly restrain polysulfide diffusion through a chemisorption effect and meanwhile regulate homogeneous sulfur nucleation, enhancing the stability of cathodes. Consequently, S@Fe/N-HPCNF cathodes realize a high initial specific capacity of 1273 mA h g-1 (areal capacity: 4.5 mA h cm-2) and long cycle life over 500 cycles with a high sulfur loading of 3.5 mg cm-2. A stable capacity of 6.6 mA h cm-2 is achieved even under 9 mg cm-2 sulfur. What's more, a pouch cell prototype with an ultrahigh sulfur area density (54 mg cm-2) was assembled and successfully lighted 10 yellow light-emitting diodes (LED), demonstrating the convenient scale-up of our S@Fe/N-HPCNF cathodes.",Nanoscale
Mechanistic Understanding of Metal Phosphide Host for Sulfur Cathode in High-Energy-Density Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.For solving the drawbacks of low conductivity and the shuttle effect in a sulfur cathode, various nonpolar carbon and polar metal compounds with strong chemical absorption ability are applied as sulfur host materials for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Nevertheless, previous research simply attributed the performance improvement of sulfur cathodes to the chemical adsorption ability of polar metal compounds toward lithium polysulfides (LPS), while a deep understanding of the enhanced electrochemical performance in these various sulfur hosts, especially at the molecular levels, is still unclear. Herein, for a mechanistic understanding of superior metal phosphide host in Li-S battery chemistry, an integrated phosphide-based host of CF/FeP@C (carbon cloth with grown FeP@C nanotube arrays) is chosen as the model, and this binder-free cathode can exclude interference from the binder and conductive additives. With a systematic electrochemical investigation of the loading sulfur in such oxide- and phosphide-based hosts (CF/Fe3O4@C and CF/FeP@C), it is found that CF/FeP@C@S shows much superior Li-S performances. The greatly enhanced performance of CF/FeP@C@S suggests that FeP can well suppress the shuttle effect of LPS and accelerate their transformation during the charge-discharge process. The first-principles calculations reveal the performance variations of Fe3O4 and FeP in Li-S batteries mainly because the shifts of the p band of the FeP could accelerate the interfacial electronics transfer dynamics by increasing the electronic concentration in the Fermi level of adsorbed Li2S4. The current work sheds light on the promising design of superior Li-S batteries from both theoretical and experimental aspects.",ACS Nano
Transitional Metal Catalytic Pyrite Cathode Enables Ultrastable Four-Electron-Based All-Solid-State Lithium Batteries,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.All-solid-state batteries can enable reversible four lithium ion storage for pyrite (FeS2) at a cutoff voltage of 1.0-3.0 V. However, strain/stress concentration generating electrode pulverization and sluggish electrochemical reaction of lithium sulfide and sulfur will affect the long cycling stability of the battery. Through experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is proved that nanostructure engineering and electronic conduction improvement with introduction of catalytic cobalt can effectively improve the electrochemical activity of FeS2. The optimized loose structured Co0.1Fe0.9S2 based all-solid-state lithium batteries show reversible capacities of 860.5, 797.7, 685.8, and 561.8 mAh g-1 after five cycles at 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mA g-1, respectively, and a stable capacity of 543.5 mAh g-1 can be maintained after cycling at a current density of 500 mA g-1 for 100 cycles. Ex situ TEM and Raman results reveal that, after the first cycle, the reversible reaction 2Li2S + Fe â†"" FeSy + (2-y)S + 4Li+ + 4e- proceeds from the following cycles onward, while nanocrystalline mackinawite FeS, Fe(III)-containing mackinawite FeS, and Fe3S4 are generated after the first discharge-charge process. This work provides a facile method for improving the electrochemical performance for multi-electron reaction mechanism based all-solid-state lithium batteries.",ACS Nano
Design and development of polybenzoxazine-POSS hybrid materials from renewable starting materials for low k and low surface free energy applications,"© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.The introduction of nano-sized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) derivatives into polymer matrices have received significant interest in recent years mainly because of the inherent properties of POSS which include low coefficient thermal expansion, low density, low thermal conductivity, low dielectric constant, high oxidation resistance, and low surface free energy. In view of this, an attempt has been made to develop thermally stable, flame retardant, low dielectric, and lower surface free energy polybenzoxazine-POSS (PBz-POSS) hybrid prepared using renewable agro-waste (cardanol, furfurylamine and stearylamine) as starting materials. A new approach involving thiol-ene click reaction has been adopted to introduce mercapto functional POSS (SH-POSS) into cardanol benzoxazines (Bz-C-F and Bz-C-S). The thermal, dielectric, flame-retardant, and contact angle studies of the prepared PBz-POSS hybrids were investigated using modern characterization techniques. The results from thermal, flame, dielectric and water contact angle studies clearly indicate that the developed renewable, cost-effective and eco-friendly PBz-POSS hybrid materials can be exploited as coatings and sealants as well as for low dielectric microelectronic applications to substitute the currently used petroleum-based raw materials.",Materials Research Express
Preparation of sulfur micro-particles suitable for lithium sulfur batteries using sulfur vapor deposition,"© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.The current paper reports the deposition of sulfur micro-particles using sulfur vapor deposition (SVD). Sulfur particles in size of 5 to 45 μm were deposited on a stainless steel substrate to be used as the cathode with porous structure in lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Mass loading of about 0.5 mg cm-2 was obtained from this pure sulfur cathode. The structure of this binder-free cathode was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and x-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical performance of the battery with two different organic liquid ether- and carbonate-based electrolytes was investigated and the results demonstrated that the battery with the ether-based electrolyte had much higher stability. By using the ether-electrolyte, an initial high discharge capacity of 1088.21 mAh g-1 was achieved for the rechargeable battery at the current density of 100 mA g-1. For the first time, this cathode showed a coulombic efficiency as high as 95.63% after 100 cycles without LiNO3 additive in the electrolyte.

One-Step in Situ Preparation of Polymeric Selenium Sulfide Composite as a Cathode Material for Enhanced Sodium/Potassium Storage,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Alkali metal-sulfur/selenium batteries have attracted much attention because they offer promising high energy density. However, the shuttle effect of the polysulfide dissolutions, poor electrical conductivity, and relatively large volume variations greatly hinder their potential applications. Herein, a novel organic carbon/selenium sulfide (OC/SeS2) composite has been prepared by a one-step in situ method by heating the mixture of commercial polyacrylonitrile (PAN) with selenium sulfide powder in vacuum. The carbonized PAN matrix with an N-doped carbon ring structure could effectively confine SeS2 in the form of small molecules and regulate its electronic structure. The superior sodium/potassium storage performance of the OC/SeS2 composite electrodes stems from their rational chemical structure design, including high electrical conductivity of the N-doped organic carbon network and chemical binding with SeS2 molecules. As a result, the OC/SeS2 cathode delivers a reversible capacity of 416 mAh g-1 after 700 cycles for sodium-ion batteries and 216 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles for potassium-ion batteries at 0.5 A g-1, respectively. These findings could open a new window to develop selenium sulfide cathode for metal-sulfur/selenium batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
"Crystal structure stabilization, electrochemical properties, and morphology of P2-type Na0.67Mn0.625Fe0.25Ni0.125O2 for Na-ion battery cathodes","© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Sodium-ion batteries are potential alternatives to lithium-ion batteries due to the natural abundance, and relatively low cost, of sodium. When used as a Na-ion battery cathode material, P2-type Na0.67Mn0.65Fe0.35O2 (NMFO) displays high reversible capacity (185 mAhg−1) and undergoes structural transitions between P63/mmc, P63 (OP4) and orthorhombic Cmcm during charge-discharge cycling between 1.5 and 4.3 V. Using Rietveld crystal structure refinement, we report that these structural transitions are completely suppressed in Na0.67Mn0.625Fe0.25Ni0.125O2 (NMFNO) during cycling. Interestingly, during discharge to 1.5 V, a mixture of two separate P63/mmc phases appears. Reversible capacity and specific energy of NMFNO are superior up to 100 cycles in the 1.5–4.0 V range, and to at least 200 cycles for 2.0–4.0 V. NMFNO displays first-cycle specific energy of 335 Whg−1, compared with 275 Whg−1 for NMFO. Scanning Electron Microscopy of the cathode surfaces after 200 cycles reveals performance-eroding cracks, and a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) shows that the total impedance of NMFNO between 1000 kHz and 0.1 Hz is significantly lower than NMFO after 200 cycles. We conclude that Ni substitution stabilizes the crystal structure by suppressing structural transitions in NMFO during cycling.",Journal of Power Sources

Sodium-Sulfur Batteries with a Polymer-Coated NASICON-type Sodium-Ion Solid Electrolyte,"© 2019 Elsevier Inc.The shuttling of dissolved sodium polysulfides through conventional porous separators has been a challenging issue with the development of room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries. In this study, a NASICON-type Na+-ion solid-electrolyte membrane, Na3Zr2Si2PO12, is used as a polysulfide-shield separator. However, as a general issue with solid-electrolyte batteries, the ionic interface between the Na-metal anode and the Na-ion conduction Na3Zr2Si2PO12 membrane is fairly poor. To address this problem, a critical approach by coating a layer of a polymer that exhibits intrinsic nanoporosity (PIN) onto the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 membrane has been developed. The PIN coating greatly improves the ionic interfacial properties between the Na anode and the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 membrane. RT Na-S batteries with a PIN-coated Na3Zr2Si2PO12 solid-electrolyte separator show enhanced cycle life. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Advances in large-scale battery technologies will help to solve our future energy and environmental challenges. Room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries are gaining much attention as a low-cost option for large-scale energy storage applications. The use of inexpensive, earth-abundant Na and S as electrode materials in an RT Na-S system offers remarkable economical superiority to traditional battery systems in terms of practical cost-performance ratio.

Alloy Anodes for Rechargeable Alkali-Metal Batteries: Progress and Challenge,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Alkali metal electrodes (including lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K)) have been strongly considered as promising candidates for next-generation batteries, beyond lithium ion batteries, because of their high theoretical specific capacities and very low electrochemical potentials. However, all alkali metal anodes are susceptible to dendrite growth, causing safety concerns, low energy efficiency, and short lifespan, which severely hampers their practical applications in working rechargeable batteries. Recently, alloy anodes with two metal components are effective to protect alkali metal anodes. In this Perspective, we analyze the alkali-metal alloy anodes based on their contribution to dendrite suppression, released capacity, and safety enhancement. Recent progress in alloy anodes, including Li/Na-X alloy (X represents the element of non-alkali metal), Li-Na alloy, and Na-K alloy, is reviewed. The perspectives and clear suggestions on the future of alkali-metal alloy anodes are presented. This sheds fresh light on the rational electrode architecture and materials for alkali metal anode and opens a new chapter for next-generation battery systems.",ACS Materials Letters
In situ Synthesis of a Bismuth Layer on a Sodium Metal Anode for Fast Interfacial Transport in Sodium-Oxygen Batteries,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimNa metal has shown great promise as anode material for Na-based batteries due to its high theoretical capacity, low potential, high abundance, and low cost. However, the uneven solid electrolyte interphase layer formed on the Na anode surface caused by side reactions with the electrolyte and serious corrosion will lead to dendrite formation and safety issues. Here we report a stable Na anode by coating a Bi layer, which is formed in situ through simple ion-exchange. The compact Bi layer can effectively prevent Na reacting with the electrolyte and suppress the formation of dendrites. The Na/Bi anode exhibits high exchange current densities and fast charge-transfer kinetics. As a result, the overpotential of the symmetric cells using this Na/Bi electrode does not increase obviously after cycling for 1000 h at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2. Moreover, the Na−O2 batteries with Na/Bi anode can run for 50 cycles. The presented surface coating approach provides a new strategy to protect Na anodes in Na-based batteries.",Batteries and Supercaps
General Synthesis of Heteroatom-Doped Hierarchical Carbon toward Excellent Electrochemical Energy Storage,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimHeteroatom-doping is an effective approach to modify the microstructure of carbon-based materials toward enhanced electrochemical energy storage performance. Nevertheless, it is a great challenge to obtain a specific heteroatom-doped carbon material with hierarchical structure as a general doping strategy is missing. Herein, carbon materials doped with P, S and both of them are designed and precisely prepared through in-situ polymerization. Used as anode for sodium-ion batteries, the best performing material displays a high specific capacity of 368.6 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles. A high capacity of 159.8 mAh g−1 is achieved at a large current density of 5 A g−1. Impressively, this material also delivers robust storage performances for lithium. According to the first-principles method and detailed experimental data, the expanded interlayer distance and enhanced electronic conductivity of the microcrystalline region can be attributed to C−S and P−C bonds, while the high surface capacitance contribution can be assigned to surface C−S species and highly exposed edges of the microcrystalline region. This work sheds light on a promising method for the exploitation of versatile heteroatom modified hierarchical carbon materials.",Batteries and Supercaps

The hollow porous structure not only effectively accommodates the volumetric expansion during the discharge-charge process but also makes the composite have a good contact with the electrolyte. In addition, the 3D open framework structure can be conducive to fast electron transportation. As a result, the Se-hollow porous carbon composite exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance when evaluated as a cathode material for rechargeable K-Se batteries.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers
"N, S co-doped porous carbon microtubes with high charge/discharge rates for sodium-ion batteries","© 2019 the Partner Organisations.Pseudocapacitance, typically occurring on the surface of the electrode material, plays a crucial role in improving the charge/discharge rate of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, N, S co-doped porous carbon microtubes (SNCTs) are prepared through modified in situ polymerization and subsequent annealing with sublimed sulphur in a nitrogen atmosphere. The one-dimensional porous hollow structure enhances the electrolyte penetration and shortens the sodium-ion diffusion pathway, while the N, S doping improves the electrical conductivity of carbon and offers excess reaction sites for sodium-ion storage. The electrode reactions are dominated by a pseudocapacitive process, which can effectively shorten the sodium-ion diffusion pathway and provide extra capacity, resulting in high-rate capability. When used as anodes for SIBs, SNCTs demonstrate good cycling stability (222 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1 after 800 cycles) and superior rate performance (288 and 252 mA h g-1 at 1000 and 2000 mA g-1, respectively). A roomerature full cell SIB is further assembled using the SNCT as the anode and commercial Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode, which exhibits a high specific capacity of 186.1 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles at 50 mA g-1.

Rational Design of Layered SnS2 on Ultralight Graphene Fiber Fabrics as Binder-Free Anodes for Enhanced Practical Capacity of Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2019, © 2019, The Author(s).Generally, the practical capacity of an electrode should include the weight of non-active components such as current collector, polymer binder, and conductive additives, which were as high as 70 wt% in current reported works, seriously limiting the practical capacity. This work pioneered the usage of ultralight reduced graphene fiber (rGF) fabrics as conductive scaffolds, aiming to reduce the weight of non-active components and enhance the practical capacity. Ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets/rGF hybrids were prepared and used as binder-free electrodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The interfused graphene fibers endow the electrode a porous, continuous, and conductive network. The in situ phase transformation from SnO2 to SnS2 could preserve the strong interfacial interactions between SnS2 and graphene. Benefitting from these, the designed binder-free electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 500 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at a current rate of 0.5 A g−1 with almost 100% Coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, the weight percentage of SnS2 in the whole electrode could reach up to 67.2 wt%, much higher than that of common electrode configurations using Cu foil, Al foil, or carbon cloth, significantly highlighting the ultralight characters and advantages of the rGF fabrics for using as binder-free electrodes of SIBs.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano-Micro Letters

BC2N monolayers as promising anchoring materials for lithium-sulfur batteries: First-principles insights,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdOne of the major challenging issues in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is that the lithium polysulfides easily dissolve in the electrolyte and shuttle between anode and cathode. To overcome this problem, an ideal anchoring materials is urgent. In the current work, we explore the potential application of BC2N allotropes (approximated by Type-I and Type-II structures) as anchoring materials for Li-S batteries by using first-principles method with van der Waals interaction. Type-I is a direct-bandgap semiconductor, while type-II is semi-metallic due to inversion symmetry of its structure. They show remarkable but not too strong chemical interaction with S8 and Li2Sx clusters and enhanced electrical conductivity. In addition, the introduction of dopants and defects result in semiconductor-to-metal transition on type-I BC2N, and enhancement of binding energies and still keep intact Li2Sx clusters.

The bond evolution mechanism of covalent sulfurized carbon during electrochemical sodium storage process 共价硫碳材料在储能过程中的价键演变机制,"© 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The excellent energy storage performance of covalent sulfur-carbon material has gradually attracted great interest. However, in the electrochemical sodium storage process, the bond evolution mechanism remains an elusive topic. Herein, we develop a one-step annealing strategy to achieve a high covalent sulfur-carbon bridged hybrid (HCSC) utilizing phenylphosphinic acid as the carbon-source/catalyst and sodium sulfate as the sulfur-precursor/salt template, in which the sulfur mainly exists in the forms of C–S–C and C–S–S–C. Notably, most of the bridge bonds are electrochemically cleaved when the cycling voltage is lower than 0.6 V versus Na/Na+, leading to the appearance of two visible redox peaks in the following cyclic voltammogram (CV) tests. The in-situ and ex-situ characterizations demonstrate that S2− is formed in the reduction process and the carbon skeleton is concomitantly and irreversibly isomerized. Thus, the cleaved sulfur and isomerized carbon could jointly contribute to the sodium storage in 0.01–3.0 V. In a Na-S battery system, the activated HCSC in cut off voltage window of 0.6–2.8 V achieves a high reversible capacity (770 mA h g−1 at 300 mA g−1). This insight reveals the charge storage mechanism of sulfur-carbon bridged hybrid and provides an improved enlightenment on the interfacial chemistry of electrode materials.",Science China Materials

Flame-Retardant Bilayer Separator with Multifaceted van der Waals Interaction for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Safety issues induced by a flammable organic electrolyte challenge the practical applications of high-specific energy lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Here, we develop a robust bilayer separator by incorporating MoO3 and Al-doped Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LLZTO). The bilayer separator is highly flame-resistive and manages to endure intense fire. Density functional calculations reveal that abundant hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces within the bilayer separator greatly suppress the combustion with interfacial adhesion of MoO3 and LLZTO to poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene). With MoO3 and LLZTO, the graphitized carbon content of the carbon residues is increased, and the formation of molybdenum fluoride (MoFx) and lanthanum fluoride (LaFx) is induced during combustion, thus suppressing heat accumulation. The bilayer separator owns a large ductility (227%) and low thermal shrinkage (5%) after annealing at 160 °C for 4 h. Based on the bilayer separator, Li/LiFePO4 cells deliver a remarkable discharge capacity of 162 mA h/g at 0.5 C with a high capacity retention of 95% after 100 cycles. This work provides a new strategy for achieving safe LIBs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Tuning anion solvation energetics enhances potassium–oxygen battery performance,"© 2019 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a critical reaction in secondary batteries based on alkali metal chemistries. The nonaqueous electrolyte mediates ion and oxygen transport and determines the heterogeneous charge transfer rates by controlling the nature and degree of solvation. This study shows that the solvent reorganization energy (λ) correlates well with the oxygen diffusion coefficient (DO2) and with the ORR rate constant (k) in nonaqueous Li–, Na–, and K–O2 cells, thereby elucidating the impact of variations in the solvation shell on the ORR. Increasing cation size (from Li+ to K+) doubled k=λ, indicating an increased sensitivity of k to the choice of anion, while variations in DO2were minimal over this cation size range. At the level of a symmetric K–O2 cell, both the formation of solvent-separated ion pairs [K+–(DMSO)n–ClO4 − + (DMSO)m–ClO4 −] and the anions being unsolvated (in case of PF6 −) lowered ORR activation barriers with a 200-mV lower overpotential for the PF6 − and ClO4 − electrolytes compared with OTf− and TFSI− electrolytes with partial anion solvation [predominantly K+–(DMSO)n–OTf−]. Balancing transport and kinetic requirements, KPF6 in DMSO is identified as a promising electrolyte for K–O2 batteries.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

They are inactive and do not participate in the charge-discharge reactions but take up resources and space within a cell. Herein, we demonstrate a proof of concept to turn the Cu and Al foils into active materials by constructing a Cu-Al full cell, with Cu undergoing stripping/deposition reactions at the cathode and Al alloying with lithium at the anode. Stable cycle performance is possible with the use of a highly concentrated electrolyte; a 3 V cell exhibits excellent cycle stability for more than 200 cycles in 6 M LiTFSI DMC electrolyte. Our Cu-Al battery can give a volumetric energy density in the range 79-156 Wh L-1, comparable to that of state-of-the-art all-vanadium redox-flow batteries. The use of inexpensive Cu and Al as active materials can also potentially reduce the cost of energy storage.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
"Sustainable applications utilizing sulfur, a by-product from oil and gas industry: A state-of-the-art review","© 2019 Elsevier LtdThis paper presents a review of current routes to utilize sulfur and sulfuric acid. Sulfur is a by-product from sour gas and crude oil processing and the precursor of sulfuric acid. As an oversupply is projected for the near-term future, it is prudent to investigate new sulfur applications and market domains that may facilitate a balancing of supply and demand. This consideration is especially relevant for the UAE, and the Middle East in general, due to the requirement to develop sulfur-rich sour gas resources to meet increasing energy needs. The goal of this review is to understand current sulfur oversupply, not as a problem, but as an opportunity to develop more sustainable technologies. Current routes are reviewed, and possible new applications and their potential as a sulfur sink and a sustainable alternative to existing technologies are discussed. Although sulfur is currently in oversupply, less than 5% positive balance according to Harrisson (2016), it must be noted that it is also a critical component in fertilizer production, having a direct impact on the food supply for the world's growing population. Should the world find itself in a sulfur shortage in the future (which could be possible in the long-term (beyond 2030) as a result of growth in renewable energies, shale gas/oil proliferation and population growth), this would be a much greater problem than the current slight oversupply situation, thus making it important to consider sulfur recoverability as a key factor for any sulfur sink technologies explored.",Waste Management
Effective Chemical Prelithiation Strategy for Building a Silicon/Sulfur Li-Ion Battery,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Prelithiation has important applications to convert a nonlithiated cathode or anode materials into a controllably lithiated state required for developing advanced Li-ion batteries. However, most of the prelithiation reagents developed so far are highly reactive and sensitive to oxygen and moisture and therefore difficult for practical battery application. In this work, we developed a facile prelithiation strategy using lithium naphthalenide to fully prelithiate sulfur-poly(acrylonitrile) (S-PAN) composite into a Li2S-PAN cathode and to partially prelithiate nanosilicon into a LixSi anode, which leads to a new version of silicon/sulfur Li-ion battery. This LixSi/Li2S-PAN battery can demonstrate a high specific energy of 710 Wh kg-1, with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.5% and a considerable cyclability. Also, this chemical prelithiation approach is mild, efficient, and widely applicable to a large range of Li-deficient electrodes, opening up new possibilities for development of low cost, environmentally benign, and high capacity Li-ion batteries.",ACS Energy Letters
In Situ Formation of a Stable Interface in Solid-State Batteries,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are considered as promising candidates for solid-state batteries. SPEs with a conventional solution casting technique have serious side reactions during charging because of the residual solvent. Here we report a creative method that can self-remove it via spontaneous reactions. The core idea is to consume the residual solvent and form stable products by choosing proper salt, solvent, and additives. Inspired by the hydrolysis of sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI), during which the proton carrier changes from H2O to HF and HF further reacts with metal oxide to form a stable hydrate, like AlF3·6H2O, NaFSI, H2O, and Al2O3/SiO2 nanoparticles are thus employed to prepare poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based SPEs. Solid-state sodium batteries with PEO/NaFSI-Al2O3-AQ electrolytes exhibit good reversibility with Na3V2(PO4)3 as the active materials, high rate performance, long-term cycling stability (92.8% after 2000 cycle), and high Coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, environmentally friendly and low-cost preparation of PEO-based SPEs is realized with this aqueous technique.",ACS Energy Letters
Current Status and Future Prospects of Metal–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium–sulfur batteries are a major focus of academic and industrial energy-storage research due to their high theoretical energy density and the use of low-cost materials. The high energy density results from the conversion mechanism that lithium–sulfur cells utilize. The sulfur cathode, being naturally abundant and environmentally friendly, makes lithium–sulfur batteries a potential next-generation energy-storage technology. The current state of the research indicates that lithium–sulfur cells are now at the point of transitioning from laboratory-scale devices to a more practical energy-storage application. Based on similar electrochemical conversion reactions, the low-cost sulfur cathode can be coupled with a wide range of metallic anodes, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and aluminum. These new “metal–sulfur” systems exhibit great potential in either lowering the production cost or producing high energy density. Inspired by the rapid development of lithium–sulfur batteries and the prospect of metal–sulfur cells, here, over 450 research articles are summarized to analyze the research progress and explore the electrochemical characteristics, cell-assembly parameters, cell-testing conditions, and materials design. In addition to highlighting the current research progress, the possible future areas of research which are needed to bring conversion-type lithium–sulfur and other metal–sulfur batteries into the market are also discussed.",Advanced Materials
"The latest advances in the critical factors (positive electrode, electrolytes, separators) for sodium-sulfur battery","© 2019The sodium-sulfur (Na/S) batteries have caused widespread concern owing to the advantages of low cost and high energy density, these advantages make them promising in the large-scale energy storage system. But the research progress in this field is still at the beginning stage and confronts with tough challenges, for example, the low sulfur conductivity and polysulfide shuttle effect. Considering Na/S battery is a complicated system whose reaction mechanism between sulfur and sodium is different from the operating temperatures, positive electrode hosts and electrolytes, thus a comprehensive understanding about the electrochemistry of the Na/S batteries that operating in high-temperature, intermediate-temperature and room-temperature is necessary. In addition, the critical factors (positive electrodes, electrolytes, separators) associated with the development of high energy density and high performance Na/S battery, it also need to be analysed for the successful application in the near future. In this review, the working methods of high-temperature Na/S (HT-Na/S) battery, intermediate-temperature Na/S (IT-Na/S) battery and room-temperature Na/S (RT-Na/S) battery will be compared, and also focus on the latest progress of positive electrodes, electrolytes and separators in Na/S batteries. Finally, we provide an outlook on the state of the art for the production of more efficient and reliable Na/S batteries with rational technique.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Stable Na Metal Anode Enabled by a Reinforced Multistructural SEI Layer,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimMetallic sodium (Na) is one of the most promising anode candidates for next-generation secondary batteries. The development of Na metal batteries with a high energy density and low cost is desirable to meet the requirements of both portable and stationary electrical energy storage. Unfortunately, several problems caused by the unstable Na metal anode severely hinder the practical applications of these batteries. Here reported is a facile but effective methodology to form a multistructural interphase layer containing a sodium fluoride-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and crisscrossed Na3Sb bars on the Na electrode surface. The reinforced Na-alloy network and chemically/electrochemically complementary SEI formation greatly improve the interphase strength and Na+ conductivity. The well-protected Na metal electrode in symmetric Na|Na cells is stable and dendrite-free in the plating and stripping cycling processes with a negligible voltage divergence, even at a large current density of 5 mA cm−2 or with a high deposition capacity of 10 mAh cm−2. Moreover, this anode is especially compatible with different cathodes and demonstrates outstanding cycle performance in the full cells. It is believed that this approach provides a practical solution toward stable Na metal anodes and related battery systems.",Advanced Functional Materials
Recent advances in understanding dendrite growth on alkali metal anodes,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdLithium metal has been considered as a “Holy Grail” anode for rechargeable batteries due to its ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity and the most negative electrochemical potential. Sodium and potassium, the alkali metals that are more abundant in the earth's crust are also regarded as candidates for next-generation anode materials, considering the low crust abundance and high cost of lithium carbonate. However, all of these alkali metal anodes are susceptible to dendrite growth, causing safety concerns, low energy density, and short lifespan, which severely hampers their practical applications. A number of models have been proposed to describe the dendrite growth mechanism/behavior and offer strategies to render a uniform and dendrite-free deposition behavior. In this review, we summarize the progress in the energy chemistry of alkali metal anodes. Firstly, the similarities and differences among three alkali metals in chemical/physical/electrochemical features are addressed. Then, special attention is paid to the understanding of mechanisms and models for Li dendrite nucleation and growth, including the thermodynamic model, space-charge model, stress and inelastic deformation model, film growth model, and phase field kinetics model. The feasibility of these models to Na and K anode systems is also discussed. Finally, general conclusions and perspectives on the current limitations and future research directions toward the understanding of mechanisms on dendrite growth are presented. This review should provide important insights into alkali metal deposition behaviors and alkali metal anode protection.",EnergyChem

Redox-flow batteries have attracted extensive attention because of their flexibility and scalability and are promising large-scale energy storage systems for electrical grids. As an emerging member of the redox-flow battery family, polysulfide flow batteries exhibit a relatively high energy density with ultralow chemical cost of the redox active materials. The special solution chemistry and complex conversions between sulfur and polysulfides with long and short chains lead to various system design schemes and complicated reaction mechanisms. Here, we present a review of various polysulfide flow battery systems developed to date and their underlying reaction mechanism and offer our perspective for their future development.",Batteries and Supercaps
Practical Implications of Using a Solid Electrolyte in Batteries with a Sodium Anode: A Combined X-Ray Tomography and Model-Based Study,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe commercial use of metal anodes is difficult due to dendrite growth during battery charge, whereas solid electrolytes (SEs) can be applied as a protective layer to mitigate this issue. In this article, X-ray tomography of cycled symmetric sodium (Na) cells with Na-β-alumina is used to validate the success of a protective layer. X-ray imaging after cell failure reveals that the SE unexpectedly breaks apart alongside a crack. The crack may have acted as the nucleation site for Na dendrite growth, which ended in short-circuiting and cell failure. Operando X-ray radiography reveals that a tilted SE is even more likely to break. Simulations complement the experimental study and shed light on the current density distribution at the edges and smallest pinholes. The results obtained emphasize that during fabrication of a battery with a protective layer, particular care needs to be taken to align the metal electrodes as flat and planar as possible. To achieve the aim of fully utilizing a metal anode in the future battery technology, much effort has to be made to engineer a proper cell design by accounting for mechanical stress in the SE material.",Energy Technology

Although pumped hydroelectric energy storage system is in the dominant position currently, battery systems and “molten salt” energy storage systems can offer more energy storage versitalities for different situations.

Electrodeposition stability of metal electrodes,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Rechargeable battery chemistries, with high energy densities, are particularly desirable in order to meet the burgeoning demand for energy storage. In this regard, metal electrodes have recently drawn extensive research interest due to the intrinsic energy density boost, while a fundamental study is needed to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing the electrodeposition stability. Here, we explore the mesoscale interactions in nucleation and growth of electrodeposition, with a focus on the competition of ion transport in the electrolyte, electrochemical reactions at the electrolyte-electrode interface, and surface self-diffusion. It is found that lithium (Li) and sodium (Na) metal anodes have the tendency to form dendrites at high local reaction rates, whereas magnesium (Mg) and aluminum (Al) do not, because of the low intrinsic self-diffusion barriers. Nonuniform electrodeposition at low reaction rates is observed, which could be attributed to the spatial inhomogeneities due to separator wetting, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, and electrode surface roughness. This work provides a fundamental understanding of the mesoscale underpinnings on the electrodeposition stability of various metal electrodes, especially shedding light on pathways toward potentially dendrite-free electrodeposition morphology.",Energy Storage Materials
Hydrophilic binder interface interactions inducing inadhesion and capacity collapse in sodium-ion battery,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.A nanoscale pseudo-graphite hard carbon offers marvelous electrochemistry properties for the sodium ion battery as anode, exhibiting a superb initial Coulombic efficiency of 86% with the sodium alginate binder, which is presumably ascribed to thin and smooth solid electrolyte interface layer. The aforesaid binder system delivers an optimal reversible capacity of 344.4 mA h g−1, maintaining 324.8 mA h g−1 (94.3% at 100th cycle)and 284.8 mA h g−1 (82.6% at 200th cycle)at 0.1C. However, this capacity collapses from 230th cycle with a representative “bluff” curve, which frequently occurs in hydrophilic binders noteworthily. Consequently, the characteristics of the sodium alginate binder are intensively explored: (a)carboxy groups build up the typical multi-dimensional infiltration network by constructing renewable hydrogen bonds (H-bonds)skeleton. (2)This network mitigates the intergranular spacing, infiltrates the micropores and decorates the solid-electrolyte-interface layer, (c)which restrains the network from decomposition caused by the electrolyte. (d)Repeated current impacting and the oxidative decomposition from the NaClO4 electrolyte eventually break the network structure, leading to in-adhesion and “bluff” capacity fading.",Journal of Power Sources
Selenium-sulfur (SeS) fast charging cathode for sodium and lithium metal batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.We report a bifunctional sodium metal battery (SMB) and lithium metal battery (LMB) cathode based on 63 wt.%SeS covalently bonded to a co-pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile (PAN) host, termed “SeSPAN”. This dense, low surface area, fully-amorphous electrode offers a highly favorable combination of reversible capacity, rate capability, and cycling life: At a fast charging rate of 1 A g−1, the reversible capacities with Na and Li are 632 and 749 mAh g−1 (based on active SeS), with cycle 1 CE of 81% in both cases. At an ultra-fast charging rate of 4 A g−1 (∼5C) the reversible capacities with Na and Li are 453 and 604 mAh g−1. Li-SeSPAN degrades 3% at cycle 500, while with Na-SeSPAN degrades by 17% after 150 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. Both Na and Li cells display a uniquely low voltage hysteresis (210 and 200 mV at a current density of 0.2 A g−1), indicative of facile charge-discharge kinetics. Analysis of the post-cycled anodes shows negligible S or Se crossover, with neither species being detected in the Li-SEI after extended cycling.",Energy Storage Materials
Easy approach to realize low cost and high cell capacity in sodium nickel-iron chloride battery,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd A sodium metal chloride battery is one of the promising candidates in the battery energy storage system which has gained considerable attention due to the global interest about environment. An easy approach is shown, in this study, to obtain the low cost and high cell capacity in a Na-(Ni,Fe)Cl 2 battery. It is the usage of Fe particles which are larger than Ni particles. Consequently, the Ni content is significantly decreased to be approximately 50 wt % in the Na-(Ni,Fe)Cl 2 cell, and this cell shows an excellent cell capacity of 263 mAh g −1 (per the weight of Ni-Fe composites). In general, the Ni content is 86–100 wt % in a Na-(Ni,Fe)Cl 2 [or Na-NiCl 2 ] battery. Especially, in this manuscript, a simple test cell is also suggested for the study of active materials in a Na-MCl 2 (M: metal) battery. Until now, it has been difficult to study a sodium metal chloride battery in a small-and-academic laboratory, since a lot of exclusive equipment is necessary to assemble the cell. It is expected that this simple test cell can assist the study of a sodium metal chloride battery in an academic laboratory.",Composites Part B: Engineering
Triglyme-based electrolyte for sodium-ion and sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Herein, we investigate a lowly flammable electrolyte formed by dissolving sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaCF3SO3) salt in triethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TREGDME) solvent as suitable medium for application in Na-ion and Na/S cells. The study, performed by using various electrochemical techniques, including impedance spectroscopy, voltammetry, and galvanostatic cycling, indicates for the solution high ionic conductivity and sodium transference number (t+), suitable stability window, very low electrode/electrolyte interphase resistance and sodium stripping/deposition overvoltage. Direct exposition to flame reveals the remarkable safety of the solution due to missing fire evolution under the adopted experimental setup. The solution is further investigated in sodium cells using various electrodes, i.e., mesocarbon microbeads (MCMBs), tin-carbon (Sn–C), and sulfur-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (S-MWCNTs). The results show suitable cycling performances, with stable reversible capacity ranging from 90 mAh g−1 for MCMB to 130 mAh g−1 for Sn–C, and to 250 mAh g−1 for S-MWCNTs, thus suggesting the electrolyte as promising candidate for application in sustainable sodium-ion and sodium-sulfur batteries.",Ionics
High-energy density room temperature sodium-sulfur battery enabled by sodium polysulfide catholyte and carbon cloth current collector decorated with MnO2 nanoarrays,"© 2018The sodium-sulfur (Na-S) battery is a well-known large-scale electrochemical storage option. The disadvantages of this particular battery technology result from its high operation temperature. Room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries would overcome these issues, but have issues of their own, such as rapid capacity decay caused by the “polysulfide shuttle” and low usage of active material resulting from the insulating nature of sulfur and the final discharge product. Here, we prepare a free-standing cathode using manganese dioxide decorated carbon cloth (CC@MnO2) as an electronically-conducting substrate and polysulfide reservoir, and sodium polysulfide (Na2S6) catholyte as the active material. Without incorporating any active interlayer, nor an expensive ion-selective membrane (such as Nafion), this free-standing cathode exhibits an initial reversible specific capacity of 938 mA h g–1 with remarkable capacity retention of 67% after 500 cycles. The as-assembled RT Na-S cell operates at an average potential of 1.82 V and delivered an initial energy density (based on the mass and molecular weight of sulfur and sodium) of 946 W h kg–1, retained an energy density of 855 W h kg–1 after 50 cycles, and attend energy density of 728 W h kg–1 after 500 cycles. Furthermore, the nature of the interactions between MnO2 and the intermediate polysulfides is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.",Energy Storage Materials
Electronic structures and binding motifs of sodium polysulfide clusters NaS n - (n = 5-9): A joint negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy and computational investigation,"© 2019 Author(s).We report a joint experimental and computational study on the electronic and geometric structures of a series of NaSn- (n = 5-9) clusters. Cryogenic, size-selective, negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to obtain their photoelectron spectra, in which distinctive spectral features with electron binding energy (EBE) up to 6.4 eV are unraveled. The EBE of the first peak in each spectrum for NaSn- (n = 5-9), assigned to the transition from the ground state of the anion to the ground state of each neutral radical, was observed to increase with cluster size. The vertical detachment energies (VDEs), measured from the first peak maximum, are 3.43 ± 0.02, 3.57 ± 0.02, 3.82 ± 0.03, 3.86 ± 0.02, and 4.00 ± 0.02 eV, and the adiabatic detachment energies (ADEs), determined from the onset of the first peak, are 3.27 ± 0.05, 3.44 ± 0.05, 3.65 ± 0.05, 3.75 ± 0.05, and 3.93 ± 0.05 eV, for n = 5-9, respectively. A number of low-lying isomers of the anions were screened and identified with density functional theory calculations, showing a structural preference of a chainlike polysulfide moiety electrostatically interacting with a sodium cation for all of the clusters. The CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ calculated VDEs and ADEs are in excellent agreement with the experimental results, confirming the identified isomers. Further analyses based on excited-state transitions, molecular orbitals, and natural population charges were performed, to assign and reveal the nature of all observed spectral bands. These computational results suggest that the electron detachment process and observed excitations are mainly derived from the polysulfide chain within each NaSn- cluster. This work provides a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic molecular properties of sodium polysulfide systems, which widely exist in life science and sodium-sulfur cells.",Journal of Chemical Physics
Impact of the Mechanical Properties of a Functionalized Cross-Linked Binder on the Longevity of Li-S Batteries,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.One of the very challenging aspects of Li-S battery development is the fabrication of a sulfur electrode with high areal loading using conventional Li-ion binders. Herein, we report a new multifunctional polymeric binder, synthesized by the free-radical cross-linking polymerization of [2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (AETMAC) and ethylene glycol diacrylate (EGDA) to form poly(AETMAC-co-EGDA), that not only helps to confine the soluble polysulfide species but also has the desired mechanical properties to allow stable cycling of high-sulfur loading cathodes. Through a combination of spectroscopic and electrochemical studies, we elucidate the chemical interactions that inhibit polysulfide shuttling. We also show that extensive cross-linkage enables this polymeric binder to exhibit a low degree of swelling as well as high tensile modulus and toughness. These attributes are essential to maintain the architectural integrity of the sulfur cathode during extended cycling. Using this material, Li-S cells with a high-sulfur loading (6.0 mg cm-2) and a low-intermediate electrolyte/sulfur ratio (7 μL:1 mg) achieve an areal capacity of 5.4 mA h cm-2 and can be (dis)charged for 300 cycles with stable reversible redox behavior after the initial cycles.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
"The role of polysulfide dianions and radical anions in the chemical, physical and biological sciences, including sulfur-based batteries","© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The well-known tendency of sulfur to catenate is exemplified by an extensive series of polysulfide dianions [Sn]2- (n = 2-9) and related radical monoanions [Sn]-. The dianions can be isolated as crystalline salts with appropriate cations and structurally and spectroscopically characterized. Although the smaller radical monoanions may be stabilized in zeolitic matrices, they are usually formed in solution via disproportionation or partial dissociation of the dianions as well as by electrochemical reduction of elemental sulfur. An understanding of the fundamental chemistry of these homoatomic species is key to unravelling their behaviour in a broad variety of chemical environments. This review will critically evaluate the techniques used to characterize polysulfide dianions and radical anions both in solution and in the solid state, i.e. Raman, UV-visible, EPR, NMR and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, chromatography and high-level quantum-chemical calculations. This is followed by a discussion of recent advances in areas in which these anionic sulfur species play a crucial role, viz. alkali-metal-sulfur batteries, organic syntheses, biological chemistry, geochemical processes including metal transport, coordination complexes, atmospheric chemistry and materials science.",Chemical Society Reviews
Dendrite-free and long-life Na metal anode achieved by 3D porous Cu,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdMetallic sodium is an ideal anode for high energy batteries because of its low cost, high natural abundance and suitable redox potential. However, the practical application of Na metal in rechargeable Na batteries is seriously limited by uneven Na plating and stripping process during cycling, which leads to Na dendrite formation and low Coulombic efficiencies (CEs). Here, we report that three-dimensional (3D) porous Cu can significantly promote the stability of Na plating/stripping, which features high CEs of 99.4% after 400 cycles at 1 mA cm−2 and low voltage hysteresis voltage (20 mV). Moreover, 3D porous structure provides highly stable and efficient plating/stripping of Na metal up to 6 mA cm−2. The excellent performance can be attributed to large specific surface area of 3D porous Cu and its good wettability of electrolyte, which is beneficial to actual current density reduction and non-dendritic growth. Due to the superior performance of anode, the full battery coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibited excellent performance that demonstrates its feasibility in practical applications.",Electrochimica Acta
Zinc ion conducting blended polymer electrolytes based on room temperature ionic liquid and ceramic filler,"© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Zinc ion conducting nanocomposite gel polymer electrolytes (NCGPEs) comprising of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)/poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA) blend, zinc triflate [Zn(OTf) 2 ] salt, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMIMTFSI) ionic liquid (IL) and fumed silica (SiO 2 ) viz. [PVC/PEMA–Zn(OTf) 2 –EMIMTFSI–SiO 2 ] exhibited the highest ionic conductivity value of 6.71 × 10 −4 Scm −1 at room temperature. The ion–filler–polymer interactions and probable conformational changes observed in the structure of the gel composites due to the entrapment of IL and dispersion of nano-sized SiO 2 were confirmed from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of NCGPEs demonstrated uniform surface with abundant interconnected micropores. The cationic transport number of NCGPE samples has been found to be appreciably enhanced up to a maximum of 0.69 thus demonstrating a considerable improvement in Zn 2+ ion conductivity. The NCGPE film possesses an electrochemical stability window up to 5.07 V (vs. Zn/Zn 2+ ) and ensures feasible zinc stripping/plating in the redox process. The addition of SiO 2 into the gel polymer electrolyte system has effectively reduced the glass-transition temperature (T g ) of the NCGPE films and also accomplished improved thermal stability up to approximately 180 °C which were ascertained from Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric (TG) results. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Single-Atom Coated Separator for Robust Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are strong contenders among lithium batteries due to superior capacity and energy density, but the polysulfide shuttling effect limits the cycle life and reduces energy efficiency due to a voltage gap between charge and discharge. Here, we demonstrate that graphene foam impregnated with single-atom catalysts (SACs) can be coated on a commercial polypropylene separator to catalyze polysulfide conversion, leading to a reduced voltage gap and a much improved cycle life. Also, among Fe/Co/Ni SACs, Fe SACs may be a better option to be used in Li-S systems. By deploying SACs in the battery separator, cycling stability improves hugely, especially considering relatively high sulfur loading and ultralow SAC contents. Even at a metal loading of ∼2 μg in the whole cell, an Fe SAC-modified separator delivers superior Li-S battery performance even at high sulfur loading (891.6 mAh g-1, 83.7% retention after 750 cycles at 0.5C). Our work further enriches and expands the application of SACs catalyzing polysulfide blocking and conversion and improving round trip efficiencies in batteries, without side effects such as electrolyte and electrode decomposition.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Enabling Safe Sodium Metal Batteries by Solid Electrolyte Interphase Engineering: A Review,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.With the merits of a naturally abundant sodium (Na) resource with similar electrochemical characteristics to that of lithium-ion batteries, Na-based batteries have been widely studied as the next-generation economical and practical energy storage choices. Particularly, the Na metal anode possesses a high theoretical specific capacity of 1166 mAh/g and low electrochemical potential of -2.71 V (vs standard hydrogen electrode), and it is therefore considered as the ultimate anode material for Na-based batteries. Nevertheless, the commercialization of the Na metal anode is still largely hindered by several long-lasting challenges, namely, metallic Na dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. In this review, we first go over the fundamental mechanisms associated with these challenges. Then, we provide an in-depth discussion on the recent key advancements from the perspectives of liquid electrolyte optimization, artificial SEI fabrication, and solid-state electrolyte implementation. Lastly, we highlight the promising aspects from each strategy for the future development of Na-based batteries.",Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research
"One-Pot Synthesis of Novel B, N Co–Doped Carbon Materials for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries","© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimBoron and nitrogen have been widely utilized as the heteroatoms to prepare boron doped carbon materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors since they can act as the electronic acceptor and enhance the electronic conductivity. However, little attention is paid to the coeffect of boron and nitrogen on the performance of carbon materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, boron, nitrogen co-doped carbon materials have been prepared through a facile, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective one-pot method, and used as the anode for SIBs. The as-obtained boron, nitrogen co-doped carbon materials show a high reversible specific capacity of 329.71 mAh g−1 and a high capacity retention of 91.3% after 100 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. The improved electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the enhanced electronic conductivity and double-layer capacitance behavior by the introduction of boron and nitrogen. The present work demonstrates that boron, nitrogen-co-doped carbon is promising anode materials for SIBs, which provides novel insights to the design of carbon anode materials for SIBs.",ChemistrySelect

Herein, a β-MnO2 nanowire/graphene-modified separator is used to improve the performance of CNF cloth/S cathodes without changing their structure. β-MnO2 can facilitate chemical bonding with polysulfides, whereas graphene can decrease the inner resistance and trap polysulfide by physical shielding. The cathode with the bifunctional separator displayed a high discharge capacity of 529.9 mAh g−1 with a low capacity decay of 0.051 % per cycle after 500 cycles at 1 C, which is 3 times higher compared with a bare separator. Even with a high sulfur loading of 9.0 mg cm−2, a high areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm−2 was delivered over 100 cycles.",ChemSusChem
Controlling Fluoride-Forming Reactions for Improved Rate Capability in Lithium-Perfluorinated Gas Conversion Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimNonaqueous metal–gas batteries based on halogenated reactants exhibit strong potential for future high-energy electrochemical systems. The lithium–sulfur hexafluoride (Li–SF6) primary battery, which utilizes a safe, noncombustible, energy-dense gas as cathode, demonstrates attractive eight-electron transfer reduction during discharge and high attainable capacities (>3000 mAh g−1carbon) at voltages above 2.2 VLi. However, improved rate capability is needed for practical applications. Here, two viable strategies are reported to achieve this by targeting the solubility of the passivating discharge product, lithium fluoride (LiF). Operating at moderately elevated temperatures, e.g., 50 °C, in DMSO dramatically improves LiF solubility and promotes sparser and larger LiF nuclei on gas diffusion layer electrodes, leading to capacity improvements of ≈10× at 120 µA cm−2. More aggressive chemical modification of the electrolyte by including a tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane anion receptor further promotes LiF solubilization; capacity increases even at room temperature by a factor of 25 at 120 µA cm−2, with attainable capacities up to 3 mAh cm−2. This work shows that bulk fluoride-forming conversion reactions can be strongly manipulated by tuning the electrolyte environment to be solvating toward F−, and that significantly improved rates can be achieved, leading a step closer to practical applications.",Advanced Energy Materials

Status and prospects of SexSy cathodes for lithium/sodium storage,"© 2019 the Partner Organisations.To meet the developing requirements of rechargeable batteries, cathode materials should have light masses, high densities, low costs, low toxicity, small oxidation potentials, and good electronic conductivities. As the cathode active material for lithium storage, sulfur (S) has high theoretical density and cost effectiveness. However, its conductivity is poor. The heavier analogue of S, viz. Se, however, has much larger electronic conductivity and higher density. Combining the advantages of S and Se, a new type of cathode material, namely, SexSy, has attracted much interest in recent years. Though SexSy has good conductivity and high volumetric capacity, the issues of shuttle effects, electrolyte suitability, and volume change during cycling still exist. To alleviate these issues, many groups have made versatile efforts to address SexSy. However, hitherto, there has been no systematic summary of this topic. Convinced by its promising synergetic effect and constructive supplement for S cathodes in rechargeable batteries, we here review the recent progress on SexSy as a cathode material for Li and Na batteries. Their syntheses, structures, electrochemical performances, and the structure-property relationships are referred to. As SexSy is a type of relatively young cathode, the electrolytes for Li-SexSy are also addressed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for Li/Na-SexSy batteries are given.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers
FeS2 hollow nanospheres as high-performance anode for sodium ion battery and their surface pseudocapacitive properties,"© 2019, Springer Nature B.V.In this work, hollow FeS2 nanospheres were successfully synthesized via a simple hydrolysis method followed by annealing and a sulfidation process. These nanospheres have diameters of approximately range from 300 to 400 nm and shells about 50 nm thick. Due to the unique hollow structures, these FeS2 reveal excellent long-cycling performance through improving the ratio of the pseudocapacitance effects in total charge storage. At a current density of 1 A g−1, the FeS2 anode delivered a high capacity of 541.5 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles. More importantly, these FeS2 could retain a capacity of 313.5 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g−1, and still achieve a capacity of 147.2 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles at a higher current density of 10 A g−1.",Journal of Nanoparticle Research
Building aqueous K-ion batteries for energy storage,"© 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.Aqueous K-ion batteries (AKIBs) are promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage due to their inherent safety and low cost. However, full AKIBs have not yet been reported due to the limited availability of suitable electrodes and electrolytes. Here we propose an AKIB system consisting of an Fe-substituted Mn-rich Prussian blue KxFeyMn1 − y[Fe(CN)6]w·zH2O cathode, an organic 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide anode and a 22 M KCF3SO3 water-in-salt electrolyte. The cathode achieves 70% capacity retention at 100 C and a lifespan of over 10,000 cycles due to the mitigation of phase transitions by Fe substitution. Meanwhile, the electrolyte can help decrease the dissolution of both electrodes owing to the lack of free water. The AKIB exhibits a high energy density of 80 Wh kg−1 and can operate well at rates of 0.1–20 C and over a wide temperature range (−20 to 60 °C). We believe that our demonstration could pave the way for practical applications of AKIBs for grid-scale energy storage.",Nature Energy
Free-standing integrated cathode derived from 3D graphene/carbon nanotube aerogels serving as binder-free sulfur host and interlayer for ultrahigh volumetric-energy-density lithium[sbnd]sulfur batteries,"© 2019 The actual applications of lithium sulfur (Li[sbnd]S) batteries are significantly obstructed by limited cyclability and low volumetric-energy-density due to the shuttling effect of polysulfides and low mass density of sulfur cathode. Herein, we report a free-standing, compact, conductive and integrated cathode (G/CNT-S//G/CNT), constructed by compressing graphene/carbon nanotubes (G/CNT) aerogels, simultaneously serving as bi-functionalities of binder- and metal-current-collector-free sulfur host (G/CNT-S) and interlayer (G/CNT), for high volumetric-energy-density Li[sbnd]S batteries. The G/CNT aerogels display three-dimensional interconnected porous network, large surface area (363 m 2 g −1 ) and high electrical conductivity (67 S m −1 ), which can endow the cathode with ultrahigh volumetric mass density (1.64 g cm −3 ) and superior electron-ion transport network. Meanwhile, the compressed ultralight G/CNT film can act as flexible interlayer for synergistically suppressing the polysulfide shuttling via both chemical interaction and physical restriction. Consequently, the compact cathodes, achieve high capacity of 1286 mAh g −1 at 0.2 C and long-term cyclability with an extremely low decay rate of 0.06% over 500 cycles at 2 C. Most importantly, our compact cathodes represent unprecedented volumetric capacity of 1841 Ah L −1 and volumetric-energy-density of 2482 Wh L −1 , both of which are the highest values of Li[sbnd]S batteries reported to date. Therefore, this proposed strategy will open a new avenue for developing high volumetric-energy-density Li[sbnd]S batteries.",Nano Energy
Rational synthesis of two-dimensional G@porous FeS 2 @C composite as high-rate anode materials for sodium/potassium ion batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Pyrite (FeS 2 ) with the advantages of high capacity, low cost and environmental benign has been considered as a promising anode material for alkali metal (Li, Na, K) ion batteries. However, the large volume expansion and its semiconductor nature result in poor battery performance and hamper its practical applications. To overcome these drawbacks, we rationally construct a two-dimensional FeS 2 -carbon architecture, from which porous FeS 2 nanoparticles are distributed within reduced graphene oxide matrix and carbon coating shell with abundant interior void space.

For sodium storage, it exhibits good cyclic performance with a high capacity 598 mA h g −1 sustained after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g −1 , and excellent rate capability (428 mA h g −1 at 10 A g −1 ). For potassium storage, it also maintains a superior rate capacity of 298 mA h g −1 at 2 A g −1 . Moreover, pseudocapacity has been proved to be dominated in charge/discharge process, accounting for the excellent rate performance.",Electrochimica Acta
Rational design of Co 9 S 8 /CoO heterostructures with well-defined interfaces for lithium sulfur batteries: A study of synergistic adsorption-electrocatalysis function,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The shuttle behavior of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish electrochemical conversion from LiPSs to Li 2 S lead to poor cycling performance, which is the major problem hindering the practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we developed a one-pot carbothermal reduction method to synthesize new CoO nanoparticles decorated Co 9 S 8 (Co 9 S 8 /CoO) heterostructures with well-defined interfaces, in which CoO shows strong adsorption function and Co 9 S 8 has significant electrocatalysis function. The Co 9 S 8 /CoO heterostructures with rationally structural design can not only improve the chemical capturing between CoO and LiPSs but also facilitate the electrocatalytic activity of Co 9 S 8 involving the reaction from soluable LiPSs to insoluble Li 2 S 2 and subsequent solid-solid reaction from Li 2 S 2 to Li 2 S. The synergistic adsorption-electrocatalysis function is verified by both theoretical calculations and electrochemical characterizations. The Li-S cell with the Co 9 S 8 /CoO-Graphene coated separator exhibits a coulombic efficiency of approximately 100% and delivers a specific capacity of 925 mA h g −1 with a fade rate of 0.049% per cycle over 1000 cycles under a high S loading (2.5 mg cm −2 ). This work provides an emerging view on the design of heterostructures with synergistic adsorption and electrocatalysis function for application in Li-S batteries and catalysis fields.",Nano Energy
"Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)@NaFePO4@C core-double-shell architectures on carbon cloth: A high-rate, ultrastable, and flexible cathode for sodium ion batteries","© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Designing and fabricating structurally optimized cathodes are critical to realize excellent electrochemical performance for sodium ion batteries. Herein, a facile and versatile sol-gel fabrication strategy followed by heat treatment is developed to synthesize Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)@NaFePO4@C core-double-shell architectures grown on flexible carbon cloth, which can be directly used as a binder-free cathode for high-performance sodium ion batteries. In the composite structure, the thickness of the maricite NaFePO4 shell can be stably confined to approximately 15 nm, which effectively promotes its electrochemical activation to achieve a high reversible capacity. The Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) core possesses a high working voltage and fast ion transport capability, while the carbon cloth and outermost carbon shell jointly build a fast three-dimensional electronic conducting network. In combination with structural and compositional advantages, the Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)@NaFePO4@C-carbon cloth cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity (136 mAh g−1 at 0.1C), excellent cycling stability (without capacity decay over 3000 cycles at 10C), and good rate capability (68 mAh g−1 at 100C). This work provides a new and effective strategy to achieve synergism between Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) and NaFePO4 for realizing superior electrochemical performance on flexible substrates.",Chemical Engineering Journal
3D Printing of Hierarchical Graphene Lattice for Advanced Na Metal Anodes,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.The expanding energy storage market has created a surge of interest in the exploration of high energy density alternatives to Li-ion batteries, and Na metal batteries have received considerable attention due to their abundant reserves and low cost. Similar to Li metal anodes, the unstable plating/stripping behaviors of Na metal anodes upon cycling hinder their practical applications at room temperature. Herein, a superelastic graphene lattice (GL) with hierarchical structures was fabricated via a 3D printing technique on the basis of the direct inkjet writing strategy. This approach enables the precise tailoring of the multiscale graphene bulk structure, from nanometer GO building elements to macroscopic monoliths. Due to the pore-structure design of the GL, the rim regions of the holes demonstrated a highly concentrated current density and could serve as preferred sites for Na deposition. This phenomenon was utilized to regulate the Na deposition; hence, a stable Na metal anode is produced. As a result, a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.84% was realized for a long lifetime of 500 cycles (-1000 h) at a current density of 1 mA cm-2. These results provide a novel insight into the rational design of graphene-based material structures at multiscale for high-performance Na metal anodes.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Unraveling the Li2S Deposition Process on a Polished Graphite Cathode for Enhancing Discharge Capacity of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Solid deposition accounts for three-quarters of the theoretical capacity in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with liquid electrolyte. Despite extensive research efforts on cathode material synthesis, little knowledge has been gained so far in understanding and controlling the growth of solid discharge product in Li-S batteries. In this work, a polished graphite was used as a cathode to understand the growth mechanism of Li2S. The SEM/EDS analysis of the discharged cathodes indicates that the Li2S precipitate can grow over a micrometer in size and its morphology strongly depends on the depth of discharge (DODs) and discharge rate of the cell. In addition, the morphology evolution and the in situ electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) show that the Li2S follows a dissolution-precipitation mechanism during its deposition on the graphite surface. Finally, a mathematical model based on the multicomponent transport theory is developed and used to describe the nucleation and precipitation phenomena on the 2D surface and the EIS spectra at different DODs. The model confirms that the surface passivation of the cathode plays a major role during the discharge of the battery and offers a simple way to measure experimentally the surface coverage as a function of the DOD in Li-S batteries. This work highlights the importance of deferring cathode surface passivation in Li-S batteries and indicates the potential utilization of nonporous carbons as alternative sulfur hosts.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Glyme-based electrolytes for lithium metal batteries using insertion electrodes: An electrochemical study,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd We report an electrochemical study of end-capped glymes dissolving lithium salts as electrolyte solutions for lithium metal batteries. Various electrolyte formulations including triethylene and diethylene glycol dimethyl ethers as solvents and lithium salts employing bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI − ), bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI − ), and bis(pentafluoroethanesulfonyl)imide (BETI − ) anions are explored. The ion transport properties, the lithium/electrolyte interphase characteristics and the electrochemical stability window are investigated by means of chronoamperometry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic cycling, and voltammetry measurements. The comparative study suggests electrochemical properties well suitable for lithium battery application which enable long cycling. The electrolyte solutions are studied in cells using an insertion cathode material, i.e., lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4 ), and the high-energy lithium metal anode. The results reveal that the electrolyte composition has a remarkable effect on the cell performances, and indicate the solutions of LiTFSI salt in either glymes as the most adequate formulations for possible applications among the ones herein investigated.",Electrochimica Acta
Exfoliated MoS2 as Electrode for All-Solid-State Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.The electrode behavior of exfoliated MoS2 is studied in an all-solid-state lithium-ion battery. MoS2 nanosheets with a crystallite thickness of about 6 nm are synthesized by chemical exfoliation of bulk MoS2 and characterized by XRD, SEM, and TEM. MoS2 composite electrodes are obtained by uniaxial cold-pressing at 3 tons and contain 60 wt % MoS2, 30 wt % β-Li3PS4 solid electrolyte, and 10 wt % carbon black. Solid-state lithium-ion batteries are assembled using β-Li3PS4 as the solid electrolyte and a Li-In alloy as the counter electrode. The electrode performance is well above state-of-the-art with an initial specific capacity of about 439 mAh g-1 when discharged at 67 mA g-1 (C/10) in the potential range of 0.01-3.0 V. The initial irreversible capacity is only 9%. The specific capacity retention is excellent with 312 mAh g-1 obtained after 500 cycles. In view of the theoretical capacity of MoS2 (qth = 670 mAh g-1), the solid-state reaction in the cell is incomplete; yet the end phases of the conversion reaction after discharge (Mo and Li2S) are confirmed by XRD. We also studied the behavior of bulk MoS2 (same mass loading) and found that the performance is inferior as compared to MoS2 nanosheets. The initial discharge capacity of bulk MoS2 is only 259 mAh g-1, and the initial irreversible capacity is as large as 26%. Overall, the study shows that MoS2 can be effectively cycled in all-solid-state batteries with β-Li3PS4 as solid electrolyte and that the electrode performance can be significantly improved by nanostructuring.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Taming Active Material-Solid Electrolyte Interfaces with Organic Cathode for All-Solid-State Batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier Inc.Attaining stable active material-solid electrolyte interfaces is a great challenge in sulfide-based all-solid-state sodium batteries (ASSSBs). A resistive layer forms at the interface upon charging above the anodic stability potential of sulfide electrolytes. In addition, contact failure at the interface during cycling is long known, but a fundamental solution is not yet available. Herein, we use an organic cathode material, pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone (PTO), to enable high-performance ASSSBs. We report, for the first time, a reversible active material-electrolyte interfacial resistance evolution during cycling. We further show for the first time that a low-modulus cathode material such as PTO maintains intimate interfacial contact with solid electrolytes during cycling, thus improving cycle life. The PTO-based cells exhibit a high specific energy (587 Wh kg−1) and a record cycling stability (500 cycles) among ASSSBs. This work reveals an effective cathode material design strategy toward compatibility with solid electrolytes and thus high-performance ASSSBs. All-solid-state sodium batteries (ASSSBs) have been attracting considerable attention as safe and low-cost alternatives to Li-ion batteries. However, the performance of ASSSBs falls short of the requirements for commercial applications because of challenges concerning the electrode-electrolyte interface. Despite high Na-ion conductivity having been reported for solid-state sulfide electrolytes, most ASSSBs suffer a short cycle life. In this work, we show that an organic cathode material with a moderate redox potential enables an (electro)chemically reversible cathode-electrolyte interface. The unique elastic properties of organic cathode materials also ensure intimate contact during cycling. The benefits of organic cathode material are reflected in the excellent cell performance, providing insights to the electrode-electrolyte interface design in ASSSBs. Forming compatible interfaces between cathode active materials and solid electrolytes is important for high-performance all-solid-state batteries. The organic cathode demonstrated here is (electro)chemically and mechanically compatible with a sulfide electrolyte. Its moderate redox potential enables the reversible formation of a resistive active material-electrolyte interface. It also maintains intimate contact with the electrolyte during cycling because of favorable mechanical properties. These features have contributed to the record cycling stability for all-solid-state sodium batteries.",Joule
Uniform Lithium Deposition Assisted by Single-Atom Doping toward High-Performance Lithium Metal Anodes,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim For a long time lithium (Li) metal has been considered one of the most promising anodes for next-generation rechargeable batteries. Despite decades of concentrated research, its practical application is still hindered by dendritic Li deposition and infinite volume change of Li metal anodes. Here, atomically dispersed metals doped graphene is synthesized to regulate Li metal nucleation and guide Li metal deposition. The single-atom (SA) metals, supported on the nitrogen-doped graphene can not only increase the Li adsorption energy of the localized area around the metal atomic sites with a moderate adsorption energy gradient but also improve the atomic structural stability of the overall materials by constructing a coordination mode of M-N x -C (M, N, and C denoted as metal, nitrogen, and carbon atoms, respectively). As a result, the as-obtained electrode exhibits an ultralow voltage hysteresis of 19 mV, a high average Coulombic efficiency of 98.45% over 250 cycles, and a stable Li plating/stripping performance even at a high current density of 4.0 mA cm −2 . This work demonstrates the application of SA metal doping in the rational design of Li metal anodes and provides a new concept for further development of Li metal batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials
Hierarchical Co 3 O 4 Nanofiber–Carbon Sheet Skeleton with Superior Na/Li-Philic Property Enabling Highly Stable Alkali Metal Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Uncontrollable dendritic behavior and infinite volume expansion in alkali metal anode results in the severe safety hazards and short lifespan for high-energy batteries. Constructing a stable host with superior Na/Li-philic properties is a prerequisite for commercialization. Here, it is demonstrated that the small Gibbs free energy change in the reaction between metal oxide (Co 3 O 4 , SnO 2 , and CuO) and alkali metal is key for metal infusion. The as-prepared hierarchical Co 3 O 4 nanofiber–carbon sheet (CS) skeleton shows improved wettability toward molten Li/Na. The 3D carbon sheet serves as a primary framework, offering adequate lithium nucleation sites and sufficient electrolyte/electrode contact for fast charge transfer. The secondary framework of Co/Li 2 O nanofibers provides physical confinement of deposited Li and further redistributes the Li + flux on each carbon fiber, which is verified by COMSOL Multiphysics simulations. Due to the uniform deposition behavior and near-zero volume change, modified symmetrical Li/Li cells can operate under an ultrahigh current density of 20 mA cm −2 for more than 120 cycles. When paired with LiFePO 4 cathodes, the Li/Co–CS cell shows low polarization and 88.4% capacity retention after 200 cycles under 2 C. Convincing improvement can also be observed in Na/Co–CS symmetrical cells applying NaClO 4 -based electrolyte. These results illustrate a significant improvement in developing safe and stable alkali metal batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
Tremella-like nitrogen-doped microporous carbon derived from housefly larvae for efficient encapsulation of small S2-4 molecules in Li-S batteries,"© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.The commercialization of rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) has been severely restricted due to the electrically insulating nature of sulfur and the dissolution of polysulfides Li2Sn (4 ≤ n ≤ 8). Herein, we demonstrated a sustainable and proficient strategy to synthesize a unique and cost-effective tremella-like nitrogen-doped microporous carbon (TNMC) materials derived from housefly larvae. The key feature of TNMC is that it possesses interconnected 3D channels with voids, high surface area (>1000 m2 g-1) along with large volume (0.62 cm3 g-1). Particularly, a high portion of ultra-micropore and the predominant pore width of ∼0.54 nm play important roles in confining the metastable small sulfur molecules (S2-4) physically. More importantly, TNMCs with sufficient nitrogen doping (6-8 wt%) not only improve the conductivity of sulfur electrode materials but also act as an active site for adsorbing S2-4 chemically and reducing the shuttle effect efficiently. Beneficial from the unique 3D microstructures with ultra-micropore and inherent nitrogen doping, the resultant LSBs show high reversible capacity with a stable Coulombic efficiency.",Materials Research Express

Since the limited sources of lithium and its skyrocketing price in recent years, the rechargeable sodium ion batteries (SIBs)and potassium ion batteries (PIBs)have attracted a great many studies due to the unlimited sources of sodium and potassium in the ocean. And the development of electrode materials and electrolytes of SIBs/PIBs are very important to better smoothly integrating the renewable resources over large-scale energy storage systems (EESs). The earth abundant iron-/manganese-based anodes are ideal candidates for further reducing the prices of electrodes with more potential practical in SIBs and PIBs.

In addition, comprehensive and integrated explanations of the structure–function–performance relationship of these composites/compounds and constructive suggestions towards obtaining better electrochemical properties and exceptional structure designs are reasonably proposed with their existing merits and shortcomings. We believe that more comprehensive explorations of these high abundant and low-cost Fe-/Mn-based anodes will surely boost the real applications of SIBs and PIBs in the near future.",Energy Storage Materials
Development of low-cost sodium-aqueous polysulfide hybrid batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.There has been increasing interest in sodium-sulfur (Na-S)batteries as an option for low-cost grid-scale energy storage. However, traditional Na-S batteries operate at high temperatures, raising concerns about long-term maintenance costs and safety. On the other hand, room-temperature Na-S batteries have their own limitations, including Na dendrite formation, polysulfide shuttling, and low utilization of active material. To overcome these issues, we present here a novel low-cost room-temperature sodium-aqueous polysulfide (Na-APS)hybrid battery system with a Na-metal anode, Na+-ion solid electrolyte separator, and an aqueous polysulfide catholyte. The solid electrolyte blocks Na dendrites and polysulfide shuttling while simultaneously protecting the reactive Na metal anode from the aqueous catholyte. The redox kinetics of the APS catholyte is improved with a rational development of a freestanding CuS-CNT catalytic electrode. The improvements with the Na-APS hybrid battery compared to the traditional Na-S battery systems are discussed. The Na-APS hybrid battery displays excellent performance under a 418 mA h g−1 of sulfur capacity-restricted cycling. The battery achieves an energy efficiency of 90% over 100 cycles at 0.5 mA cm−2 current density.",Energy Storage Materials
"A nitrogen, sulphur dual-doped hierarchical porous carbon with interconnected conductive polyaniline coating for high-performance sodium-selenium batteries","© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Sodium-selenium (Na-Se)battery has been emerging as a new rechargeable energy storage system with high capacity, low cost and high rate capability. However, the shuttling of polyselenides from the cathode to the anode causes dramatic capacity decay, severely impeding their practical applications. Herein, we report a combinational strategy of nitrogen and sulphur dual-doped hierarchical porous carbon with interconnected conductive polyaniline (PANI)coating to incorporate Se as stable cathodes (i-PANI@NSHPC/Se)for Na-Se batteries. Ex situ characterizations and density functional theory (DFT)calculations demonstrate that the i-PANI@NSHPC/Se cathode can provide both physical diffusion barrier and strong chemical affinity for polyselenides. In addition, the interconnected conductive polyaniline network enhances the conductivity for electrons and ions. With this strategy, the i-PANI@NSHPC/Se cathode delivered a high reversible capacity of 617 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.2C with a low capacity decay rate of 0.013% per cycle and an excellent rate capability at 20 C. Importantly, stable cycling performances were achieved with high capacities at different Se areal mass loadings (1.2, 2.3, 3.5 mg cm−2). This work could provide an efficient approach for developing Na-Se batteries with high active material mass loading, high rate capacity and long cycle life.",Energy Storage Materials
Remarkable enhancement in the electrochemical activity of maricite NaFePO 4 on high-surface-area carbon cloth for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The electrochemical reversibility of maricite NaFePO 4 is highly dependent on the rational design of the nanostructure. We propose, for the first time, an effective strategy of applying an acid-etched carbon cloth (eCC) as the substrate to be loaded with NaFePO 4 @C and significantly enhance the electrochemical activity of the maricite. The electrochemical test results show that the NaFePO 4 @C loaded on eCC exhibits a much higher reversible capacity (142 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C) than that (107 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C) of the material loaded on an Al current collector. Moreover, compared to that of the untreated carbon cloth (CC), NaFePO 4 @C loaded on eCC shows a superior rate performance and ultralong cycling lifetime at high mass loading levels. The excellent electrochemical performance of the NaFePO 4 @C-eCC electrode benefits from the regular grooves on the surface of the eCC, which provide a significantly larger surface area that is favorable to NaFePO 4 @C strongly and uniformly binding onto the carbon fibers. The self-supporting electrode configuration, that is, without the addition of an inactive binder and conductive additives, facilitates fast ion/electronic transport and reduces the aggregation of the NaFePO 4 @C particles. This work is expected to provide a new route for achieving high electrochemical activity in NaFePO 4 .",Carbon
A zero fading sodium ion battery: High compatibility microspherical patronite in ether-based electrolyte,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.The state-of-the-art vanadium sulfide VS4, a linear-chain compound of disulfide anions [S2]2– with vanadium atoms, has proved to have high potential in the field of secondary batteries due to its unique properties. Possessing qualities of a remarkable theoretical capacity, high electrical conductivity, natural abundance, and environmental friendliness, VS4 is determined to be a significant candidate for new high-energy storage systems. However, the fundamental drawbacks of capacity-fading issues, such as structure collapse or active-material loss during repeated cycling, critically limit the practical applications of VS4. Overcoming those obstacles, the present work used a design strategy to develop a VS4 electrode with a unique secondary morphology and utilize it in combination with a specific choice of an ether-based electrolyte for sodium ion batteries. This pristine VS4 displayed exceptional rate performance with excellent and stable cycling ability. An important finding in this study is the presence of a highly protective solid electrolyte interphase layer along the surface of the primary particle, which limits the polysulfide dissolution and hence preserves the active material during the reaction with sodium, as observed using ex-situ potentio-electrochemical impedance spectroscopy examinations. The detailed complex redox process of VS4/Na was also elucidated by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.",Energy Storage Materials
Silica-free sealing glass for sodium-beta alumina battery,"© 2018 The American Ceramic Society A CaO-Bi 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -B 2 O 3 glass system was studied as a sealant for sodium-sulfur battery. The thermal properties such as thermal expansion coefficient, glass transition, and softening temperature were determined by dilatometry and differential scanning calorimetry. Selected glasses, based on the thermal properties, were bonded with α-alumina substrate followed by aging in air at 400°C for 100 hours and in sodium vapor at 350°C for 100 hours. The interfacial compatibility and resistance to sodium vapor corrosion of the bonded and aged samples were evaluated by structural and microstructural analysis using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) attached with energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). Helium leakage test was performed at room temperature to examine the sealing ability of the select glass.

The microspheres of broccoli-like K0.17MnO2 made up of large rod particles with a size of about 200 nm in diameter are synthesized by hydrothermal method followed by calcination at 500 °C in air for 2 h. The cyclic voltammetry measurement demonstrates that it is easy to intercalate into the cathode for zinc ions with smaller radius compared with potassium ions. The galvanostatic charge/discharge test displays that it delivers the initial discharge capacity of 189.3 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after adding 0.05 mol L−1 MnSO4 into the hybrid electrolyte. Meanwhile, the discharge capacity retains still up to 78.4 mAh g−1 at a current density of 3200 mA g−1, indicating the much better cycle stability than that without additive and the superfast ion transport characteristic.",Ionics
Surface-Driven Energy Storage Behavior of Dual-Heteroatoms Functionalized Carbon Material,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Heteroatom modification represents one of the major areas of carbon materials' research in electrical energy storage. However, the influence of heteroatomic state evolution on electrochemical properties remains an elusive topic. Herein, thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid is chemically activated to prepare O,S-diatomic hybrid carbon material (OS–C). The heteroatoms and carbon matrix coexist in the form of CO/CO and CS/SS bonds, which introduce porous networks to the partially graphitized carbon skeleton and provide abundant active sites for better ion absorption. Moreover, the heteroatoms and carbon matrix are bridged to establish stable pseudocapacitive functional groups like quinoid unit and disulfide bonds, which can be electrochemically converted into benzenoid units and mercaptan anions through Faradaic reactions to further improve the reversible capacity. Combined with the detailed kinetic exploration and in situ investigation of the electrochemical impedance spectra, the energy storage mechanism for lithium/sodium is proposed in the following steps: Faradaic reactions at a higher potential range, energy storage at active sites, and ions intercalation on the graphitized parts in the low-voltage states. Greatly, the electrode can store lithium up to the capacity of ≈700 mAh g −1 , while also delivering ≈330 mAh g −1 of sodium storage, providing lifetimes in excess of thousands of cycles.",Advanced Functional Materials
"Relieving the ""sudden Death"" of Li-O 2 Batteries by Grafting an Antifouling Film on Cathode Surfaces","© 2019 American Chemical Society. The ""sudden-death"" phenomenon has been frequently encountered during discharging of Li-O 2 batteries and has been ascribed to the growth of a blocking film of Li 2 O 2 on the cathode surface. Recent fundamental study revealed that this dilemma could be addressed by discharging Li 2 O 2 in the electrolyte solution rather than on the cathode surface. However, even for Li-O 2 batteries operated under the conditions favorable for the solution growth of Li 2 O 2 , sudden death still persists and its origin remains incompletely understood. Herein, by using a combination of in situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculation, we reveal that sudden death of Li-O 2 batteries operated under the conditions (e.g., low discharge current density and high donor number electrolyte solvent) favorable for discharging Li 2 O 2 in the electrolyte solutions is caused by adventitious adsorption of a minor quantity of Li 2 O 2 , which triggers a rapid transition of Li 2 O 2 growth mode from solution- to surface-mediated growth. Moreover, a cathode surface modification strategy has been developed to effectively retard the Li 2 O 2 adsorption and therefore significantly alleviate the sudden death of Li-O 2 batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Encapsulation of SeS 2 into Nitrogen-Doped Free-Standing Carbon Nanofiber Film Enabling Long Cycle Life and High Energy Density K-SeS 2 Battery,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society. K-SeS 2 batteries could provide a low-cost and high energy density energy storage system, because the earth-abundant element potassium (K) shows a low reduction potential and a high gravimetric capacity. But the K-SeS 2 battery has never been reported because of the lack of high-performance electrode materials. Herein, we design an advanced K-SeS 2 battery by encapsulation of SeS 2 in the nitrogen-doped free-standing porous carbon matrix (SeS 2 @NCNFs). The self-supported SeS 2 @NCNFs electrode achieves a high reversible capacity of 417 mAh g -1 after 1000 cycles with 85% capacity retention at 0.5 Ag 1- with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency. The nanosized SeS 2 nanoparticles are encapsulated in the carbon matrix, which minimizes the volume expansion during cycling and shortens the ion transport pathways, thus enhancing the rate capability. The interconnected porous carbon nanofiber structure could improve the flexibility and offer a continuous pathway for rapid ionic/electronic transport. The DFT calculations confirm that high content N-doping (11.2 at. %) can enhance the chemical affinity between the discharge product and the N-doped carbon. The pyrrolic and pyridinic N-doping lead to stronger adsorption than that of the graphitic N-doping. This proposed design holds great promise for practical application of high energy density K-SeS 2 batteries.",ACS Nano
"Metal Nanoclusters: New Paradigm in Catalysis for Water Splitting, Solar and Chemical Energy Conversion","© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimA sustainable future demands innovative breakthroughs in science and technology today, especially in the energy sector. Earth-abundant resources can be explored and used to develop renewable and sustainable resources of energy to meet the ever-increasing global energy demand. Efficient solar-powered conversion systems exploiting inexpensive and robust catalytic materials for the photo- and photo-electro-catalytic water splitting, photovoltaic cells, fuel cells, and usage of waste products (such as CO2) as chemical fuels are appealing solutions. Many electrocatalysts and nanomaterials have been extensively studied in this regard. Low overpotentials, catalytic stability, and accessibility remain major challenges. Metal nanoclusters (NCs, ≤3 nm) with dimensions between molecule and nanoparticles (NPs) are innovative materials in catalysis. They behave like a “superatom” with exciting size- and facet-dependent properties and dynamic intrinsic characteristics. Being an emerging field in recent scientific endeavors, metal NCs are believed to replace the natural photosystem II for the generation of green electrons in a viable way to facilitate the challenging catalytic processes in energy-conversion schemes. This Review aims to discuss metal NCs in terms of their unique physicochemical properties, possible synthetic approaches by wet chemistry, and various applications (mostly recent advances in the electrochemical and photo-electrochemical water splitting cycle and the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells). Moreover, the significant role that MNCs play in dye-sensitized solar cells and nanoarrays as a light-harvesting antenna, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into fuels, and concluding remarks about the present and future perspectives of MNCs in the frontiers of surface science are also critically reviewed.",ChemSusChem
Insights into Sodium Ion Transfer at the Na/NASICON Interface Improved by Uniaxial Compression,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.A robust ceramic solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity is a key component for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). In terms of the demand for high-energy-density storage, researchers have been tackling various challenges to use metal anodes, where a fundamental understanding on the metal/solid electrolyte interface is of particular importance. The Na+ superionic conductor, so-called NASICON, has high potential for application to ASSBs with a Na anode due to its high Na+ ion conductivity at room temperature, which has, however, faced a daunting issue of the significantly large interfacial resistance between Na and NASICON. In this work, we have successfully reduced the interfacial resistance as low as 14 ω cm2 at room temperature by a simple mechanical compression of a Na/NASICON assembly. We also demonstrate a fundamental study of the Na/NASICON interface in comparison with the Na/β′′-alumina counterpart by means of the electrochemical impedance technique, which elucidates a stark difference between the activation energies for interfacial charge transfer: ∼0.6 eV for Na/NASICON and ∼0.3 eV for Na/β′′-alumina. This result suggests the formation of a Na+-conductive interphase layer in pressing Na metal on the NASICON surface at room temperature.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
High Performance Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Battery by Eutectic Acceleration in Tellurium-Doped Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Room temperature (RT) sodium-sulfur batteries suffer from slow reaction kinetics and polysulfide dissolution, resulting in poor performance. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile is a unique sulfur cathode which is suggested to involve only S3-4 and shows high specific capacity. Herein, the designed Te0.04S0.96@pPAN with 4 mol % Te used as eutectic accelerator exhibits significantly enhanced reaction kinetics and excellent sulfur utilization, leading to a high performance RT Na-S battery. Te0.04S0.96@pPAN delivers capacities of 1236 and 629 mA h g-1 and 1111 and 601 mA h g-1 at 0.1 and 6 A g-1 in carbonate and ether electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, UV-vis spectra and the shuttle current test reveal diminished sodium polysulfides in ether electrolyte, attributed to the fast kinetics enabled by Te doping. More significantly, the spectral technique and electrochemical analysis demonstrate a two-step reaction pathway in which Na2S3 and Na2S are the main intermediate and final discharge product, respectively. This method provides a promising approach toward applicable RT Na-S batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Stable Na Plating and Stripping Electrochemistry Promoted by In Situ Construction of an Alloy-Based Sodiophilic Interphase,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Sodium metal anodes are poor due to the reversibility of Na plating/stripping, which hinders their practical applications. A strategy to form a sodiophilic Au–Na alloy interphase on a Cu current collector, involving a sputtered Au thin layer, is shown to enable efficient Na plating/stripping for a certain period of time. Herein, electrochemical behaviors of Na plating on different substrates are explored, and it is revealed that the sodiophilic interphase can be achieved universally by in situ formation of M–Na (M = Au, Sn, and Sb) alloys during Na plating prior to Na bulk deposition in the initial cycle. Moreover, it is found that repetitive alloying–dealloying leads to falling-off of thin film sodiophilic materials and thus limits the lifespan of efficient Na cycling. Therefore, an approach is further developed by employing particles of sodiophilic materials combined with the control over the cutoff potential, which significantly improves the stability of Na plating/stripping process. Especially, the low-cost Cu@Sn-NPs and Cu@Sb-MPs composite current collectors allow Na plating and stripping to cycle for 2000 and 1700 times with the average efficiency of 99.9% at 2 mA cm −2 .",Advanced Materials
Three-Dimensionally Reinforced Freestanding Cathode for High-Energy Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society. Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery cathodes suffer from poor conductivity, rapid dissolution of intermediate products, and potentially destructive volume change during cycling. The optimal way to minimize these problems could be a construction of a nanocomposite cathode scaffold combining different components selected for their particular functions. Here, we have combined the excellent electronic conductivity of reduced graphene oxide, polysulfide adsorption ability of the ultrafine manganese oxide nanocrystals, rapid ion/electron dissemination efficiency of nanosized sulfur, and outstanding mechanical stiffness and good electrical conductivity of Na alginate/polyaniline hybrid binder in a single electrode heterostructure. At 0.2 A g -1 , an RT Na-S battery containing the freestanding cathode delivers an initial specific cap acity of 631 mA h g -1 . By delivering a nominal discharge voltage of 1.81 V, our Na-S batteries bestow a high specific energy of 737 W h kg -1 at the 2nd cycle and 660 W h kg -1 was retained after 50 cycles. The effect of the amount of electrolyte additive is also well demonstrated in this study.

"High-Abundance and Low-Cost Metal-Based Cathode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries: Problems, Progress, and Key Technologies","© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRecently, room-temperature stationary sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received extensive investigations for large-scale energy storage systems (EESs) and smart grids due to the huge natural abundance and low cost of sodium. The SIBs share a similar “rocking-chair” sodium storage mechanism with lithium-ion batteries; thus, selecting appropriate electrodes with a low cost, satisfactory electrochemical performance, and high reliability is the key point for the development for SIBs. On the other hand, the carefully chosen elements in the electrodes also largely determine the cost of SIBs. Therefore, earth-abundant-metal-based compounds are ideal candidates for reducing the cost of electrodes. Among all the high-abundance and low-cost metal elements, cathodes containing iron and/or manganese are the most representative ones that have attracted numerous studies up till now. Herein, recent advances on both iron- and manganese-based cathodes of various types, such as polyanionic, layered oxide, MXene, and spinel, are highlighted. The structure–function property for the iron- and manganese-based compounds is summarized and analyzed in detail. With the participation of iron and manganese in sodium-based cathode materials, real applications of room-temperature SIBs in large-scale EESs will be greatly promoted and accelerated in the near future.",Advanced Energy Materials
Toward a Reversible Calcium-Sulfur Battery with a Lithium-Ion Mediation Approach,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Calcium represents a promising anode for the development of high-energy-density, low-cost batteries. However, a lack of suitable electrolytes has restricted the development of rechargeable batteries with a Ca anode. Furthermore, to achieve a high energy density system, sulfur would be an ideal cathode to couple with the Ca anode. Unfortunately, a reversible calcium-sulfur (Ca-S) battery has not yet been reported. Herein, a basic study of a reversible nonaqueous room-temperature Ca-S battery is presented. The reversibility of the Ca-S chemistry and high utilization of the sulfur cathode are enabled by employing a Li + -ion-mediated calcium-based electrolyte. Mechanistic insights pursued by spectroscopic, electrochemical, microscopic, and theoretical simulation (density functional theory) investigations imply that the Li + -ions in the Ca-electrolyte stimulate the reactivation of polysulfide/sulfide species. The coordination of lithium to sulfur reduces the formation of sturdy Ca-S ionic bonds, thus boosting the reversibility of the Ca-S chemistry. In addition, the presence of Li + -ions facilitates the ionic charge transfer both in the electrolyte and across the solid electrolyte interphase layer, consequently reducing the interfacial and bulk impedance of Ca-S batteries. As a result, both the utilization of active sulfur in the cathode and the discharge voltage of Ca-S batteries are significantly improved.",Advanced Energy Materials
"Ratiometric Electrochemical Sensors Associated with Self-Cleaning Electrodes for Simultaneous Detection of Adrenaline, Serotonin, and Tryptophan","Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Electrochemical sensors have long suffered from issues such as nonspecific adsorption, poor anti-interference ability, and internal and external disturbances. To address these challenges, we developed a facile electrochemical method, which integrated a ratiometric strategy with self-cleaning electrodes. In the novel sensing system, the self-cleaning electrode was realized via forming a hydrophobic layer on carbonized ZIF-67@ZIF-8 (cZIF) by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) precursor vaporization. As for ratiometry, it is worth to mention that the measurements were conducted by adding an interior reference (methylene blue) directly into electrolyte solution, which is more facile and flexible to operate compared with conventional ones. Sensing performance of the self-cleaning electrode as well as the newly established ratiometric strategy was explored fully, and it turned out that PDMS@cZIF nanocomposites provided decent electrocatalytic ability, superhydrophobic property, and stability. Furthermore, the ratiometric strategy significantly elevated the robustness and reproducibility of electrochemical sensing. Simultaneous detection of Adr, 5-HT, and Trp was performed under the optimum experimental conditions with wide linear ranges and low detection limits. Finally, the original ratiometric electrochemical sensor was successfully applied for monitoring the three target molecules in biological samples.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Surfactant assisted electrospinning of WS 2 nanofibers and its promising performance as anode material of sodium-ion batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Metal sulfides were considered as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, volume expansion during charging/discharging is an issue. One dimensional nanofibers are considered here to alleviate the change in stress of the anode's structure. Here we incorporated the nanofibers and WS 2 nanosheets which used (DODA) 3 PW 12 O 40 as the precursor. The precursor was prepared by an ion-exchange method, and then used to fabricate the anode material (denoted as DODA-WS 2 ) via electrospinning. Use of surfactant dimethyldistearylammonium bromide (DODA·Br) disperses the WS 2 nanosheets in the nanofibers. Carbonization and decomposition of DODA ligands provides porosity that accommodates volume expansion. The resulting structure of the anode material delivers high capacities of 363 and 318 mAh g −1 with 96% and 91% rate capacity retention after 400 cycles at 200 and 500 mA g −1 , respectively. Also, improved rate capabilities (395 and 91 mAh g −1 at 50 and 10000 mA g −1 , respectively) and good cycling stability (226.5 mAh g −1 after 800 cycles at 1000 mA g −1 ). These unique results are ascribed to the well-dispersed WS 2 cross-linked nanofiber framework and its conductive network. This structure facilitates the transportation of electrons and Na + and relieve the stress due to expansion. DODA-WS 2 has a high potential for use as anode materials in SIBs.",Electrochimica Acta
Strong Surface Bonding of Polysulfides by Teflonized Carbon Matrix for Enhanced Performance in Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Battery,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim The practical application of room temperature sodium-sulfur (Na–S) battery remains far away from the market due to the poor coulombic efficiency and cyclic stability which in turn arises from high dissolution of intermediate polysulfides in carbonate-based electrolytes, slow reaction kinetics, and low electrical conductivity of sulfur. In this aspect, an advanced cathode structure by incorporating Teflon-lined conductive carbon substrate (TCS) as a supporting cathode to efficiently immobilize the migration of soluble polysulfides to the anode, as well as enhance the conductivity during the polysulfide conversion, is presented here. After inclusion of TCS, the cell delivers a specific capacity of 800 mAh g −1 at 0.1C (1C = 1672 mA g −1 ) with 85% enhancement in specific capacity. Also, a stable cyclic stability of about 300 cycles with an excellent capacity retention of about 93% and coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% is obtained. Teflon, which has a linear carbon chain surrounded completely by fluorine atoms, acts as the anchoring sites for trapping the intermediate sodium polysulfides. This study provides a simple approach of controlling the shuttling effect, which can be beneficial for the development of high energy density room temperature Na–S battery.",Advanced Materials Interfaces

Herein, we develop a facile methodology for the synthesis of precise carbon-confined hybrid nanostructures by stereoselective assembly accompanied by catalytic pyrolysis. Polyacrylonitrile fiber films favors not only metal-polymer coordination, but also oriented assembly to ensure the well-defined nanostructure of the carbon hybrids. During chemical vapor deposition (CVD), cobalt-nanoparticle-catalyzed growth of carbon-nanotube branches driven by organic molecules (e.g. melamine) delivers hierarchical carbon hybrids. The resulting carbon hybrids exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance for metal-ion batteries, for example, a high specific capacity of 680 mAh g −1 after 320 cycles (Li-storage) and 220 mAh g −1 after 500 cycles (Na-storage) without decay.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition

A bioinspired functionalization of polypropylene separator for lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2019 by the authors.Lithium-sulfur batteries have received intensive attention, due to their high specific capacity, but the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfide results in a decrease in capacity. In response to this issue, we develop a novel tannic acid and Au nanoparticle functionalized separator. The tannic acid and gold nanoparticles were modified onto commercial polypropylene separator through a two-step solution process. Due to a large number of phenolic hydroxyl groups contained in the modified layer and the strong polarity of the gold nanoparticles, the soluble polysulfide generated during battery cycling is well stabilized on the cathode side, slowing down the capacity fade brought by the shuttle effect. In addition, the modification effectively improves the electrolyte affinity of the separator. As a result of these benefits, the novel separator exhibits improved battery performance compared to the pristine polypropylene separator.",Polymers

Batteries of various types and sizes are considered one of the most suitable approaches to store energy and extensive research exists for different technologies and applications of batteries; however, environmental impacts of large-scale battery use remain a major challenge that requires further study. In this paper, batteries from various aspects including design features, advantages, disadvantages, and environmental impacts are assessed. This review reaffirms that batteries are efficient, convenient, reliable and easy-to-use energy storage systems (ESSs). It also confirms that battery shelf life and use life are limited; a large amount and wide range of raw materials, including metals and non-metals, are used to produce batteries; and, the battery industry can generate considerable amounts of environmental pollutants (e.g., hazardous waste, greenhouse gas emissions and toxic gases) during different processes such as mining, manufacturing, use, transportation, collection, storage, treatment, disposal and recycling. Battery use at a large scale or grid-scale (>50 MW), which is widely anticipated, will have significant social and environmental impacts; hence, it must be compared carefully with alternatives in terms of sustainability, while focusing on research to quantify externalities and reduce risk.

In this account, we describe our recent efforts regarding SIL-based electrolytes for Li, Na, K, and Mg batteries with respect to structural, physicochemical, and electrochemical characteristics. Systematic studies based on crystallography and Raman spectroscopy combined with thermal/electrochemical stability analysis showed that the balance of competitive cation−anion and cation−solvent interactions predominates the stability of the solvate cations.

Metal-organic framework-derived hierarchical Co 3 O 4 @MnCo 2 O 4.5 nanocubes with enhanced electrocatalytic activity for Na-O 2 batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry. The Na-O 2 battery system is attracting increasing attention due to its superiority in specific capacity and cost. However, its practical implementation is hindered by many issues, such as high charge-discharge overpotential, limited cycling life, and poor reversibility, all of which result from the mediocre O 2 electrode.

Visualizing the Oxidation Mechanism and Morphological Evolution of the Cubic-Shaped Superoxide Discharge Product in Na–Air Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Sodium–air (Na–O 2 ) batteries have recently developed as a high theoretical energy density energy storage and conversion system. In particular, Na–O 2 batteries with superoxide as the discharge product have a very high round-trip energy efficiency over lithium–air batteries due to their significantly reduced charging overpotential. However, Na–O 2 batteries yet suffer from limited cycling lives because of the formation and incomplete removal of side products during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes, while the mechanism of these processes is still not fully understood. Herein, a detailed investigation on tracking the decomposition pathway of cubic-shaped micrometer-sized NaO 2 discharge products in Na–O 2 batteries with carbon-based air electrodes is reported. A detailed electrochemical charging mechanism is revealed during the charging process. The evolution of the chemical compositions of the discharge/side products in air electrode during charging is also verified by synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments. The formation of these intermediate phases other than NaO 2 during the charging process results in high overpotentials. These new findings can contribute to a better understanding and the rational design of future Na–O 2 batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
Single Additive with Dual Functional-Ions for Stabilizing Lithium Anodes,"© 2019 American Chemical Society. The dendritic lithium formation and sustained lithium consumption caused by the uncontrollable side reactions between lithium and electrolytes seriously restrict the applications of lithium anodes in high-energy density batteries, especially in carbonate electrolytes. Ameliorating the surface status of lithium anodes is critical for modulating lithium deposition behavior and improving the cycling stability of lithium metal batteries. Herein, magnesium chloride salt is first reported as a carbonate electrolyte additive for lithium surface modification by in situ reaction. It is proved that both Cl - and Mg 2+ play important roles in building a stable electrode/electrolyte interface with a fast Li + diffusion property. The coexistence of inorganic LiCl and metallic Mg species in the interface can effectively decrease the surface side reactions, lower interphase resistance, promote Li ions diffusion, and result in uniform lithium deposition. The electrochemical tests show that the reversible utilization rate of lithium for Li/Cu asymmetrical cells increases by 10% and the polarization of Li/Li symmetrical cells is reduced noteworthily with such an additive. Furthermore, a significant improved cycling performance of Li/Li 4 T 5 O 12 full cells is also achieved.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Rechargeable aqueous Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) are very promising for large-scale grid energy storage applications owing to their low cost, environmentally benign constituents, excellent safety, and relatively high energy density. Their usage, however, is largely hampered by the fast capacity fade. The complexity of the reactions has resulted in long-standing ambiguities of the chemical pathways of Zn/MnO 2 system. In this study, we find that both H + /Zn 2+ intercalation and conversion reactions occur at different voltages and that the rapid capacity fading can clearly be ascribed to the rate-limiting and irreversible conversion reactions at a lower voltage. By limiting the irreversible conversion reactions at â1.26 V, we successfully demonstrate ultrahigh power and long life that are superior to most of the reported ZIBs or even some lithium-ion batteries.",Chemistry of Materials
Scalable Synthesis of Size-Controlled Li2S Nanocrystals for Next-Generation Battery Technologies,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Lithium sulfide (Li2S) nanocrystals (NCs) are critical materials for emerging solid-state and Li-S battery technologies. Conventional synthesis is energy intensive and costly, and offers limited size control. Here we describe a scalable approach wherein Li2S is formed by contacting hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas with metalorganic solution at ambient temperature. NCs are recovered with essentially 100% yield in a subsequent evaporation step. Control of NC size and uniformity is demonstrated through manipulating parameters such as precursor concentration and solvent evaporation rate. A suite of complementary techniques confirm the production of anhydrous, phase-pure Li2S nanocrystals with tunable size (5-20 nm) and narrow particle size distributions. Mild annealing conditions are identified to provide the purity necessary for battery applications, while retaining the original size distribution. Simple cathodes fabricated from the resulting NCs show promising battery performance, where the capacity approaches the theoretical value and displays good cyclability and rate capability.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Nitrogen-Doped Carbon as a Host for Tellurium for High-Rate Li–Te and Na–Te Batteries,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimA nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon sponge, used as a matrix for tellurium accommodation, was designed and prepared in this work. The porosity of the matrix played an important role in enhancing the electrochemical performance of Li/Na–Te batteries. Specifically, the mesopores could accommodate active materials whereas the macropores provided sufficient space for partial Te accommodation and volume expansion in discharge. In addition, N heteroatoms in carbon species could enhance the electrical conductivity and widen its application in lithium/sodium storage. The monolithic and flaky architecture of the nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon sponge/tellurium composite offered a highly conductive network for fast electron transportation. As a result, the nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon sponge/tellurium composite achieved a superior rate performance for Li–Te and Na–Te batteries.",ChemSusChem
New Interpretation of Na+-Ion Conduction in and the Structures and Properties of Sodium Borosilicate Mixed Glass Former Glasses,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.A new study has been made of the well-known sodium borosilicate glass system to improve the overall and detailed understanding of both the atomic level structures in these glasses and the correlation of these structures to their physical properties. The specific intent is to examine the isocompositional, Na2O content, variation of the Na+-ion conductivity with the mixing ratio x of the amounts of B2O3 and 2SiO2 (Si2O4, which keeps the number of glass former cations constant across this series) in these glasses. This study deepens our ongoing examination of the mixed glass former effect (MGFE) on the Na+ ion conductivity in these glasses. In doing so, we also report and examine the MGFE on the density, the mechanical moduli, and the glass-transition temperature, Tg. The most significant structural change that occurs in these glasses is the formation of large fractions of tetrahedral borons, B4, that leads to densification and strengthening of the glass structure and, as a result, causes what appears to the very first negative MGFE in the alkali-ion conductivity in an oxide glass. Until this study, all studies of the MGFE in oxide glasses have shown that the alkali-ion conductivity is a positive function of the mixing ratio of the two glass formers. The weak negative effect reported here appears to be a direct result of the positive MGFEs observed in the density, the Tg, and all of the mechanical moduli of these glasses. Weak negative MGFE in the Na+-ion conductivity appears to be consistent with an increasing strain energy to Na+ conduction caused by the densification of the structure, leading to the increased mechanical energy necessary to force the dilation of the volume necessary to accommodate the Na+-ion motion between sites. This negative MGFE in the volumetric strain energy appears therefore to overcome a slight reduction in the coulombic binding energy between the Na+ ion and its counter anions caused by the formation of weakly basic B4 anion sites. An improved model for ion conduction in solid electrolyte glasses is developed as a result of modeling the composition dependence of the Na+-ion conductivity in these glasses.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Ultrathin 2D Sheets of Graphene and WS2 for Energy Storage Applications,"© 2019 IEEE.Ultrathin 2D-nanomaterials are currently being exploited and employed for energy storage applications. Graphene nanosheets (GNS) are the most favorable candidate for energy storage and charge transfer due to its extraordinary novel properties. Other than graphene, various 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are used in charge storage applications too. In this article, ultrathin 2D sheets of various 2D materials like graphene and TMDs like WS2 were being prepared by liquid phase exfoliation method. The exfoliated 2D sheets were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-Vis spectrometer, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). SEM and AFM being used to determine the morphology and dimensional aspects of prepared exfoliated sheets, respectively. The exfoliated sheets were coated over PET membranes in single layer and layer by layer assembly for evaluating their supercapacitance, respectively. The prepared films were tested with galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles and cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 1 M Na2SO4 as electrolyte. Results obtained from layer by layer assembly of WS2-GNS showed a high efficiency of 96% charge retention after 1000 cycles. The WS2/GNS multilayer films can exhibit a high value of specific capacitance about 800 F kg-1 and area calculated for this capacitance was 70 F m-2 under 10 mVs-1 scan rate. And the film exhibits good cycle stability over 1000 cycles. The results suggest that the WS2-GNS layer by layer assembly is quite suitable as well as favorable electrode materials for high performance energy storage devices like supercapacitors.","Proceedings of 2019 16th International Bhurban Conference on Applied Sciences and Technology, IBCAST 2019"
"Zwitterions for Organic/Perovskite Solar Cells, Light-Emitting Devices, and Lithium Ion Batteries: Recent Progress and Perspectives","© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimZwitterions, a class of materials that contain covalently bonded cations and anions, have been extensively studied in the past decades owing to their special features, such as excellent solubility in polar solvents, for solution processing and dipole formation for the transfer of carriers and ions. Recently, zwitterions have been developed as electrode modifiers for organic solar cells (OSCs), perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), and organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs), as well as electrolyte additives for lithium ion batteries (LIBs).

Hollow Co 3 S 4 /C anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers as a free-standing anode for high-performance Li-ion batteries,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Cobalt sulfide coupled with carbon materials attracts tremendous interest as a promising anode for Li-ion storage. In this paper, hollow Co 3 S 4 /C nanoparticles (NPs) with a uniform size of 30 nm homogeneously anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (denoted as Co 3 S 4 /CNF) are prepared by electrospinning method, followed by carbonization and sulfuration process. The free-standing Co 3 S 4 /CNF composites are straightly acted as binder- and current collector-free anode for lithium-ion battery, which demonstrate a high reversible capacity of 742 mAh·g −1 at 200 mA·g −1 after 200 cycles and 436 mAh·g −1 at 1 A·g −1 after 500 cycles, respectively. Such superior lithium storage performance of the Co 3 S 4 /CNF composites can be ascribed to the synergetic effect of the composites structure, which can effectively facilitate the electron and lithium ion diffusion, restrain the volumetric variation and keep the structure intact.",Electrochimica Acta
Graphene-Encapsulated FeS 2 in Carbon Fibers as High Reversible Anodes for Na + /K + Batteries in a Wide Temperature Range,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Developing low cost, long life, and high capacity rechargeable batteries is a critical factor towards developing next-generation energy storage devices for practical applications. Therefore, a simple method to prepare graphene-coated FeS 2 embedded in carbon nanofibers is employed; the double protection from graphene coating and carbon fibers ensures high reversibility of FeS 2 during sodiation/desodiation and improved conductivity, resulting in high rate capacity and long-term life for Na + (305.5 mAh g −1 at 3 A g −1 after 2450 cycles) and K + (120 mAh g −1 at 1 A g −1 after 680 cycles) storage at room temperature. Benefitting from the enhanced conductivity and protection on graphene-encapsulated FeS 2 nanoparticles, the composites exhibit excellent electrochemical performance under low temperature (0 and −20 °C), and temperature tolerance with stable capacity as sodium-ion half-cells. The Na-ion full-cells based on the above composites and Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 can afford reversible capacity of 95 mAh g −1 at room temperature. Furthermore, the full-cells deliver promising discharge capacity (50 mAh g −1 at 0 °C, 43 mAh g −1 at −20 °C) and high energy density at low temperatures. Density functional theory calculations imply that graphene coating can effectively decrease the Na + diffusion barrier between FeS 2 and graphene heterointerface and promote the reversibility of Na + storage in FeS 2 , resulting in advanced Na + storage properties.",Small
Unraveling the Formation Mechanism of Solid-Liquid Electrolyte Interphases on LiPON Thin Films,"© 2019 American Chemical Society. Most commercial lithium-ion batteries and other types of batteries rely on liquid electrolytes, which are preferred because of their high ionic conductivity, and facilitate fast charge-transfer kinetics at the electrodes. On the other hand, hybrid battery concepts that combine solid and liquid electrolytes might be needed to suppress unwanted shuttle effects in liquid electrolyte-only systems, in particular if mobile redox systems are involved in the cell chemistry. However, at the then newly introduced interface between liquid and solid electrolytes, a solid-liquid electrolyte interphase forms. In this study, we analyze the formation of such an interphase between the solid electrolyte lithium phosphorous oxide nitride (Li x PO y N z , ""LiPON"") and various liquid electrolytes using in situ neutron reflectometry, quartz crystal microbalance, and atomic force microscopy measurements. Our results show that the interphase consists of two layers: a nonconducting layer directly in contact with ""LiPON"" and a lithium-rich outer layer. Initially, a fast growth of the solid-liquid electrolyte interphase is observed, which slows down significantly afterward, resulting in a thickness of about 20 nm eventually. Here, a formation mechanism is proposed, which describes the solid-liquid electrolyte interphase growth as the fast deposition of a film, which mostly covers the ""LiPON"", with only a little degree of remaining porosity. The residual void space is then slowly filled, thus blocking the remaining channels for ionic conduction, which leads to increasing resistance of the interphase. The results obtained imply that hybrid battery concepts with liquid electrolyte and solid electrolyte can be hampered by highly resistive interphases, whose formation cannot be simply slowed down or suppressed. Further research is required regarding possible countermeasures.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Controllable Chain-Length for Covalent Sulfur–Carbon Materials Enabling Stable and High-Capacity Sodium Storage,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Room temperature sodium–sulfur batteries have emerged as promising candidate for application in energy storage. However, the electrodes are usually obtained through infusing elemental sulfur into various carbon sources, and the precipitation of insoluble and irreversible sulfide species on the surface of carbon and sodium readily leads to continuous capacity degradation. Here, a novel strategy is demonstrated to prepare a covalent sulfur–carbon complex (SC-BDSA) with high covalent-sulfur concentration (40.1%) that relies on SO 3 H (Benzenedisulfonic acid, BDSA) and SO 4 2− as the sulfur source rather than elemental sulfur. Most of the sulfur is exists in the form of OS/CS bridge-bonds (short/long-chain) whose features ensure sufficient interfacial contact and maintain high ionic/electronic conductivities of the sulfur–carbon cathode. Meanwhile, the carbon mesopores resulting from the thermal-treated salt bath can confine a certain amount of sulfur and localize the diffluent polysulfides. Furthermore, the CS x C bridges can be electrochemically broken at lower potential (<0.6 V vs Na/Na + ) and then function as a capacity sponsor. And the R-SO units can anchor the initially generated S x 2− to form insoluble surface-bound intermediates. Thus SC-BDSA exhibits a specific capacity of 696 mAh g −1 at 2500 mA g −1 and excellent cycling stability for 1000 cycles with 0.035% capacity decay per cycle.",Advanced Energy Materials

Ultra-stable sodium metal-iodine batteries enabled by an in-situ solid electrolyte interphase,"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd High capacity sodium (Na) metal anodes open up new opportunities for developing next-generation rechargeable batteries with both high power and high energy densities. However, many challenges still plagued their practical application, including low plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency (CE) and dendrite growth after repeated cycle inducing safety issue. Especially, the sodium metal is less stable in organic (i.e. carbonate-based) electrolytes than lithium metal, due to the more unstable organic solid–electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, we report a facile technology to stabilize sodium metal anode and inhibit the growth of sodium dendrites. The in-situ ultrathin NaI SEI layer successfully endows best-performance Na/I 2 metal batteries (>2200 cycles) with high capacity (210 mA h g −1 at 0.5 C) based on the conversion reaction chemistry with higher discharge voltage plateau (> 2.7 V) and lower overpotential (134 mV) due to the fast charge transfer dynamics and interfacial stability compared with pristine Na anode. The detailed theoretical calculations and experimental results elucidate that NaI layer has a much lower diffusion barrier compared to that of NaF (NaF as one the most commonly found inorganic components in Na-based SEI layer), and actually facilitates more uniform sodium deposition. This work provides a new avenue for designing low-cost, high-performance and high-safety sodium metal-iodine batteries and other metal-iodine batteries.",Nano Energy

Fluorine atom-inducing graphene oxide in situ coating SnPO composites as anode for sodium ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdWith the development of society, rechargeable batteries are becoming ever-popular in people's lives. Although rechargeable sodium-ion batteries have attracted a large number of researchers, they suffer from the limited cycle stability and low capacity. To address these issues, tin-phosphorus-oxygen (SnPO) composite materials were protected by the curling of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) induced by the fluorine atoms from the electrolyte. The in-situ coating protection not only can increase the electrical conductivity, but also more importantly adjust the large volume expansion and suppress the pulverization of electrode materials during cycling. As a result, the SnPO composite delivers an initial discharge/charge capacity of 843 mAh g−1/450 mAh g−1at the current density of 50 mA g−1 and still retains a reversible discharge capacity of ∼420 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles. Moreover, it achieves a superior rate performance with the capacity of 200 mAh g−1at the current density of 2000 mA g−1. The superior electrochemical performance and the facile in-situ protection strategy will make a great contribution to the future development of rechargeable batteries.",Materials Today Energy
Concentrated electrolytes unlock the full energy potential of potassium-sulfur battery chemistry,"© 2018Rechargeable K-S batteries provide a theoretical energy density almost double that of the current Li-ion batteries. However, in practice, this energy potential is largely compromised predominantly because of the dissolution and shuttle reactions of the redox intermediates in the commonly used electrolytes. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that a 5 M concentrated electrolyte can effectively mitigate this parasitic effect and enables a full energy utilization of the K-S battery chemistry. The prototype K-S batteries operating at an average discharging voltage of 2.1 V deliver a discharging energy density of ~1270 Wh/kgS or ~700 Wh/kg(K2S3), which reaches the theoretical limit and is ~40%–100% higher than those of the current Li-ion batteries. X-ray powder diffraction analysis provides the first unambiguous evidence that the K-S battery chemistry involves reversible stepwise phase transformations of S8⇔K2S6⇔K2S5⇔K2S4⇔K2S3. This work shines a light on the full utilization and in-depth mechanistic understanding of high-energy-density K-S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Nip the Sodium Dendrites in the Bud on Planar Doped Graphene in Liquid/Gel Electrolytes,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium (Na) metal is the most promising alternative anode to metallic lithium for high-energy batteries due to the low cost and high abundance of Na resources, but it suffers from severe dendritic/mossy growth at high current densities. Understanding Na nucleation/growth mechanism in different electrolyte systems is the key to tackling this issue but is complicated by the structural complexities of existing substrates for Na plating/stripping. Herein, well-defined planar doped graphene substrates are synthesized as model plating platforms to unravel a binding energy dominant Na nucleation-growth mode. The dopants (e.g., boron) in doped graphene and the regions close to the dopants possess high binding energies with Na atoms, providing abundant preferential nucleation sites and contributing to uniform Na plating/stripping. Accordingly, the boron-doped graphene regulated Na anode exhibits long-term stability at high current densities in both liquid and polymer electrolytes. The results enhance the understanding of Na nucleation/growth for stabilizing Na metal batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
Chem-Bonding and Phys-Trapping Se Electrode for Long-Life Rechargeable Batteries,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Selenium-carbon materials present an interesting opportunity for rechargeable battery systems. They are usually obtained through infusing elemental Se into various carbon sources. Herein, a self-thermal-reduction method is successfully applied to prepare covalent Se carbon material (CPSe, Se: 10.8 wt%) utilizing polyselenophene (PSe) as a dual source of selenium and carbon matrix, in which selenium is mainly present with the form of CSe bond. Interestingly, most of them are found to break away from the carbon skeleton as the discharge voltage is gradually scanned down to a lower stage, and then selenide is progressively oxidized to elemental Se in the charge process. Furthermore, employing a space-confined strategy, a high Se mass loading composite (Se-CPSe, 56.8 wt%) is effectively produced with the simultaneous introduction of covalent Se and physical-trapped Se. In this electrode, the physical-restricted Se part exhibits a reversible capacity of 420 mA h g −1 at 100 mA g −1 for the Na-Se battery. More significantly, after being activated at 0.01–3.0 V in the initial cycles, the electrochemical cleaved covalent Se and physical-confined Se can jointly contribute specific capacity of ≈590 mA h g −1 . Such strategies and understanding are important for the future design and optimization of electrode materials for Na-Se batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
Thermodynamic Overpotentials and Nucleation Rates for Electrodeposition on Metal Anodes,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Rechargeable batteries employing metal negative electrodes (i.e., anodes) are attractive next-generation energy storage devices because of their greater theoretical energy densities compared to intercalation-based anodes. An important consideration for a metal's viability as an anode is the efficiency with which it undergoes electrodeposition and electrodissolution. The present study assesses thermodynamic deposition/dissolution efficiencies and associated nucleation rates for seven metals (Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Al, and Zn) of relevance for battery applications. First-principles calculations were used to evaluate thermodynamic overpotentials at terraces and steps on several low-energy surfaces of these metals. In general, overpotentials are observed to be the smallest for plating/stripping at steps and largest at terrace sites. The difference in the coordination number for a surface atom from that in the bulk was found to correlate with the overpotential magnitude. Consequently, because of their low bulk coordination, the body-centered alkali metals (Li, Na, and K) are predicted to be among the most thermodynamically efficient for plating/stripping. In contrast, metals with larger bulk coordination such as Al, Zn, and the alkaline earths (Ca and Mg) generally exhibit higher thermodynamic overpotentials. The rate of steady-state nucleation during electrodeposition was estimated using a classical nucleation model informed by the present first-principles calculations. Nucleation rates are predicted to be several orders of magnitude larger on alkali metal surfaces than on the other metals. This multiscale model highlights the sensitivity of the nucleation behavior on the structure and composition of the electrode surface.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
High-Performance Quasi-Solid-State MXene-Based Li-I Batteries,"© 2019 American Chemical Society. Lithium-iodine (Li-I) batteries have attracted tremendous attention due to their high energy and power densities as well as the low cost of iodine. However, the severe shuttle effect of iodine species and the uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth have strongly hindered their practical applications. Here we successfully develop a quasi-solid-state Li-I battery enabled by a MXene-based iodine cathode and a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) containing NaNO 3 particles dispersing in a pentaerythritol-tetraacrylate-based (PETEA-based) gel polymer electrolyte. As verified by experimental characterizations and first-principle calculations, the abundant functional groups on the surface of MXene sheets provide strong chemical binding to iodine species, and therefore immobilize their shuttling. The PETEA-based polymer matrix simultaneously suppresses the diffusion of iodine species and stabilizes the Li anode/CPE interface against dendrite growth. The NaNO 3 particles act as an effective catalyst to facilitate the transformation kinetics of LiI 3 on the cathode. Owing to such synergistic optimization, the as-developed Li-I batteries deliver high energy/power density with long cycling stability and good flexibility. This work opens up a new avenue to improve the performance of Li-I batteries.",ACS Central Science
Roomerature potassium-sulfur batteries enabled by microporous carbon stabilized small-molecule sulfur cathodes,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Potassium-sulfur (K-S) batteries are a promising alternative to lithium ion batteries for large-area energy storage applications, owing to their high capacity and inexpensiveness, but they have been seldom investigated. Here we report roomerature K-S batteries utilizing a microporous carbon-confined small-molecule sulfur composite cathode. The synergetic effects of the strong confinement of microporous carbon matrix and the small-molecule sulfur structure can effectually eliminate the formation of soluble polysulfides and ensure a reversible capacity of 1198.3 mA h g-1 and retain 72.5% after 150 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of ∼97%. The potassium-storage mechanism was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations. The results suggest that K2S is the final potassiation product along with the reaction of 2K + S → K2S, giving a theoretical capacity of 1675 mA h g-1. Our findings not only provide an effective strategy to fabricate high-performance roomerature K-S batteries but also offer a basic comprehension of the potassium storage mechanism of sulfur cathode materials.",ACS Nano
Insight into the discharge products and mechanism of room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries: A first-principles study,"© 2019 American Chemical Society. Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries have recently gained much attention as a low-cost candidate for application in large-scale energy storage, especially in stationary energy. For performance improvement of RT-Na/S batteries, a full understanding of the actual reaction process and discharge products is needed. In this work, we discovered the most stable structure of Na 2 S 3 and a new phase of Na 2 S 2 (Î3-Na 2 S 2 ) by using first-principles unbiased structure searching calculations. Analysis of the thermodynamics and electrochemical activity indicates that Na 2 S 3 acts as a stable product like Na 2 S 2 and Na 2 S, but it can spontaneously disproportionate into Na 2 S 2 , Na 2 S, and S in an RT-Na/S battery. The structure of Na 2 S 3 not only matches the last sloping region of the experimental discharge profile but also gives a direct explanation of the experimental Raman peaks at 476, 458, and 238 cm -1 . Our work makes a contribution to a full understanding of the mechanism for the discharge progress in RT-Na/S batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
"Toward a stable sodium metal anode in carbonate electrolyte: A compact, inorganic alloy interface","© 2019 American Chemical Society. Development of the next-generation, high-energy-density, low-cost batteries will likely be fueled by sodium (Na) metal batteries because of their high capacity and the abundance of Na. However, their practical application is significantly plagued by the hyper-reactivity of Na metal, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and dendritic Na growth, leading to continuous electrolyte decomposition, low Coulombic efficiency, large impedance, and safety concerns. Herein, we add a small amount of SnCl 2 additive in a common carbonate electrolyte so that the spontaneous reaction between SnCl 2 and Na metal enables in situ formation of a Na-Sn alloy layer and a compact NaCl-rich SEI. Benefitting from this design, rapid interfacial ion transfer is realized and direct exposure of Na metal to the electrolyte is prohibited, which jointly achieve a nondendritic deposition morphology and a markedly reduced voltage hysteresis in a Na/Na symmetric cell for over 500 h. The Na/SnCl 2 -added electrolyte/Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 full cell exhibits high capacity retention over cycling and excellent rate capability (101 mAh/g at 10 C). This work can provide an easily scalable and cost-effective approach for developing high-performance Na-metal batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters
Trimethyl Phosphate for Nonflammable Carbonate-Based Electrolytes for Safer Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim To address the safety concern for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries, such as fires easily triggered by organic electrolytes, an applicable non-flammable electrolyte formula was developed by introducing trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into 1.0 M NaClO 4 -ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolyte. It is demonstrated that the electrolyte containing 15 wt.% TMP was a optimized formula, exhibiting nonflammability, thermal stability, electrochemical compatibility and lasting cell performance. Using this optimized electrolyte formula, the sulfur cathode exhibited a stable capacity of 788 mAh g −1 at a rate of 0.1 C and excellent rate capability of 441 and 177 mAh g −1 for 200 cycles at rates of 1 C and 5 C, respectively. When the TMP content further increases to 25 wt.%, the specific capacity of batteries declined significantly due to unstable SEI. Our study can shed light on the development of flame-retardant electrolyte for room-temperature sodium-sulfur or other batteries.",ChemElectroChem
N/S codoped carbon microboxes with expanded interlayer distance toward excellent potassium storage,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Carbonaceous materials for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are quite attractive for the cost-effective feature. However, the cycle stability and rate performance of carbonaceous anode materials based on PIBs are limited, for the difficulty of accommodating large K ions (1.38 Å). Thus, the nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) codoped carbon microboxes (NSC) with increased interlayer spacing is prepared via a carbonization-etching process. Unlike the traditional graphite, in which the K ions are difficult to insert into the restricted interlayer spacing, the NSC displays extremely large interlayer spacing of 0.412 nm, making the K ions more flexible during the insertion/extraction process in NSC. Moreover, ex-situ TEM study reveals that the layer structure of NSC is well-remained during the potassiation/depotassiation process. As a result, the NSC delivers super-long cycle life (180.5 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1 after 1000 cycles) and extraordinary rate ability (155.6 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1), which makes the NSC a promising anode material for PIBs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Carbonized-MOF as a Sulfur Host for Aluminum–Sulfur Batteries with Enhanced Capacity and Cycling Life,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim The rechargeable aluminum–sulfur (Al–S) battery is a promising next generation electrochemical energy storage system owing to its high theoretical capacity of 1672 mAh g −1 and in combining low-cost and naturally abundant elements, Al and S. However, to date, its poor reversibility and low lifespan have limited its practical application. In this paper, a composite cathode is reported for Al–S batteries based on S anchored on a carbonized HKUST-1 matrix (S@HKUST-1-C). The S@HKUST-1-C composite maintains a reversible capacity of 600 mAh g −1 at the 75th cycle and a reversible capacity of 460 mAh g −1 at the 500th cycle under a current density of 1 A g −1 , with a Coulombic efficiency of around 95%. X-ray diffraction and Auger spectrum results reveal that the Cu in HKUST-1 forms S–Cu ionic clusters. This serves to facilitate the electrochemical reaction and improve the reversibility of S during charge/discharge. Additionally, Cu increases the electron conductivity at the carbon matrix/S interface to significantly decrease the kinetic barrier for the conversion of sulfur species during battery operation.",Advanced Functional Materials
Nitrogen-doped CoOx/carbon nanotubes derived by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition: Efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdHerein, an advanced technique of plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition is applied to in-situ adjust the intrinsic crystal structure and chemical composition of cobalt oxides by nitrogen-doping. The homogeneous N-CoOx thinfilm is conformally deposited on high-surface-area carbon nanotubes which maintains the one-dimensional structures. The N-CoOx/carbon nanotubes electrocatalyst displays remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The onset potential for oxygen reduction reaction is 0.9 V, which is about 80 mV positively shifted compared to the undoped sample while the oxygen evolution reaction performance is also improved by reducing the overpotential of 35 mV after nitrogen doping. Moreover, the limiting current density of N-CoOx/carbon nanotubes electrocatalyst is comparable to the benchmarking Pt/C while the former one exhibits better stability which is only 5% loss of current after operation for 10000 s and for the latter one is 11%. The improved electrochemical performance is affected by the introduction of N-dopant and the results provide a direction for designing and constructing other metal oxides as bifunctional electrocatalysts for air batteries and water splitting reactions.",Electrochimica Acta
Ultrafine CuO nanoparticles decorated activated tube-like carbon as advanced anode for lithium-ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdRecently, copper oxide (CuO) as promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has received much interest. Hybridizing CuO with carbon is considered as a valid way to improve the conductivity and alleviate the volume effect of CuO, but how to achieve more optimized utilization rate of CuO-based anodes still remains a big challenge for us. In this work, activated tube-like carbon (ATC) is firstly prepared by pre-carbonization followed by alkali etching process using palm tree bark hair as initial carbon source, then the ATC is used as carbon matrix to load CuO by a modified phase-transfer approach. As a result, ultrafine CuO nanoparticles decorated ATC (ATC/CuO) can be obtained. For comparison, we also synthesize tube-like carbon (TC) by a direct pyrolysis process, and obtain TC/CuO hybrid by similar loading method. The morphology, structure, composition and surface property of the two carbon matrixes and the corresponding C/CuO hybrids are all systematically investigated. The results show that ATC/CuO hybrid possesses rich C–O–Cu bond and unique ultrafine CuO structure, which is attributed to the co-effect of abundant oxygen-containing groups, large specific surface area and special microporous property of ATC matrix. Consequently, the ATC/CuO electrode exhibited much enhanced cycling stability and rate capability when compared to sole CuO and TC/CuO electrodes.

Metal-Sulfur Batteries: Overview and Research Methods,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Rechargeable metal-sulfur batteries (RMSBs) represent one of the most attractive electrochemical systems in terms of energy density and cost. In most of the proposed systems, the anode side is metallic and the cathode side is elemental sulfur impregnated in a porous matrix. Despite the relatively low voltage of these systems, they attract a lot of attention and are considered to be very promising as next-generation batteries for the following reasons: (1) utilization of active metal anodes enables a leap in specific energy due to the high capacity of metal anodes in comparison to intercalation compounds, (2) sulfur as a cathode exhibits high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh/g), and (3) system components make RMSBs low-cost, less toxic batteries. Nevertheless, the high reactivity of metallic anodes (e.g., Li, Na, Mg, and Al) and the solubility of sulfur species in the electrolyte render these batteries unstable and hinder their practical realization. In this Perspective, we focus on rechargeable sulfur batteries with active metal anodes, present important studies conducted in this field, and summarize the reported methods and techniques that are mandatory for effective and practical studies of RMSB.",ACS Energy Letters
Understanding Shuttling Effect in Sodium Ion Batteries for the Solution of Capacity Fading: FeS 2 as an Example,"© 2019 American Chemical Society. Pyrite (FeS 2 ) has been regarded as one of the most promising electrode materials for sodium ion batteries owing to high theoretical capacity and low cost. However, the short cycle life of FeS 2 electrode in sodium storage hampers its further development. Although some researchers focused on the mechanism of capacity fading in Na/FeS 2 battery, such as irreversible crystal transform, terrible volume change, and so on, whether and how the shuttling effect of FeS 2 electrode exists in half-cell or full-cell systems still remain so far. In this work, the shuttling effect on sodium ion batteries with FeS 2 as electrode is investigated systematically in both half-cell and full-cell systems and it is confirmed the shuttle of Fe element and polysulfides simultaneously. These shuttling effects were influenced significantly by some factors. In detail, excessive voltage will cause oxidation for shuttled Fe and polysulfides and side reactions often take place at low voltage; carbonate electrolyte can react with polysulfides; stable solid electrolyte interface could prevent the loss of elements. According to these influence factors, as an example, a designed nano FeS 2 @C composite was synthesized to limit the shuttling effects. As a result, in a large operating voltage range of 0.01-3 V, it shows high capacity (about 600 mAh g -1 ) and good cyclic performance with ether-based electrolyte.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
A Scalable Approach for Dendrite-Free Alkali Metal Anodes via Room-Temperature Facile Surface Fluorination,"© 2019 American Chemical Society. Alkali metals are attractive anode materials for advanced high-energy-density battery systems because of their high theoretical specific capacities as well as low electrochemical potential. However, severe dendrite growth as well as high chemical reactivity restrict their practical application in energy storage technologies. Herein, we propose a facile scalable solution-based approach to stabilize Li and Na anodes via the facile process of immersing the Li/Na metal in a nonhazardous ionic liquid 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate for several minutes at room temperature before battery assembly. This produces a dense and robust artificial fluoride layer, formed in situ by the reaction of the ionic liquid and Li/Na metal. As a demonstration, a homogeneous and compact LiF coating on the Li metal anode was fabricated via our method and it can effectively suppress the growth of Li dendrites and the continuous decomposition of electrolytes during cycling. As a result, the LiF-coated metallic Li anode achieves an enhanced cycling lifespan of over 700 h with low overpotential (∼22 mV) at 1 mA cm -2 , as well as a very high Coulombic efficiency of up to 98.1% for 200 cycles at 1 mA cm -2 . Furthermore, the successful achievements of the dendrite-free Na deposition show the versatility of room-temperature surface fluorination for potential battery applications.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Hierarchical porous stratified texture and enhanced lithium-ion storage performance of Co3O4 modified by nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxides,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Choosing, designing and preparing the alternative electrode materials are of highly urgent for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in sustainable energy storage fields. Herein, a novel and well-dispersive hierarchical porous stratified texture of Co3O4 modified by nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxides (N-rGO/Co3O4) microplates are successfully synthesized via a reproducible and mass-produced route. The N-rGO/Co3O4 microplates are hierarchically self-assembled by a few porous thin nanoflakes and the N-rGO is uniformly permeated into Co3O4 matrix. As an anode material for LIBs, the N-rGO/Co3O4 microplates deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1890 mAh·g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a Coulombic efficiency as high as 77.6%. During the 1000 charging-discharging cycles, the capacities and Coulombic efficiencies maintain at 1000 mAh·g−1 and 99.6%. Even the current density is increased to 2 A g−1, the electrode still delivers a stable capacity of 770 mAh·g−1 for 500 cycles. Moreover, the rate performance is highly superior. Such an advanced Li ions storage of the N-rGO/Co3O4 microplates is mainly due to the modification of small quantity N-rGO improving the electric conductivity without sacrificing the capacity of Co3O4 and the hierarchical porous stratified texture. Hence, the hierarchical porous N-rGO/Co3O4 microplates and synthetic strategy can be applied for next-generation LIBs in the near future.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Enabling High Lithium Conductivity in Polymerized Ionic Liquid Block Copolymer Electrolytes,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimHerein, the use of a novel block copolymer host, based on a polymerized ionic liquid block copolymer, is proposed. Mechanically robust solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with high lithium conductivity are developed using a ternary polymer electrolyte system, consisting of a poly(styrene-b-1-((2-acryloyloxy)ethyl)-3-butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfo-nyl)imide) (S-PIL64-16) block copolymer, a N-propyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (C3mpyrFSI) ionic liquid (IL) and a lithium bis (fluorosulfonyl) imide (LiFSI) salt. The impact of both IL and lithium salt concentration on the morphology, ion migration processes and electrochemical performance of the electrolytes is characterized. High lithium ion conductivity is achieved when anion to Li+ molar ratio was kept below a value of 1.5, resulting in a lithium transport number ((Formula presented.)) as high as 0.53 at 50 °C. Finally, the cycling performance in a Li|LiFePO4 full cell is assessed using an in-house formulated solid-state high loading cathode (LiFePO4 loading=10 mg cm−2, 1.8 mAh cm−2). 98 % of the theoretical discharge capacity (167 mA g−1) is achieved for the first cycle at a C-rate of C/20 at 50 °C. The results herein reported are the first demonstration of a PIL block copolymer-IL-salt composite electrolyte operating at near-practical levels, making them a promising choice of electrolyte for the next generation of solid-state high capacity lithium-metal batteries.",Batteries and Supercaps

KGaA, Weinheim The combination of Mg and S is considered as an attractive candidate for metal-sulfur batteries due to their high volumetric energy density and adequate existence of natural resources. However, Mg−S batteries suffer from polysulfide dissolution and shuttling which leads to reduced cycle life and stability. Here we report the significance of the chemical interaction between magnesium polysulfide and N, S dual-doped carbon cloth for improving the cycle life. Compared to undoped carbon cloth, the dual-doped carbon cloth as current collector shows improved electrochemical performance. When the dual-doped carbon cloth as current collector is used in Mg−S cell, it retains the capacity up to 388 mAhg −1 after 40 cycles.

KGaA, WeinheimRoom-temperature (RT) sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries are attractive cost-effective platforms as the next-generation energy storage systems by using all earth-abundant resources as electrode materials. However, the slow kinetics of Na–S chemistry makes it hard to achieve high-rate performance. Herein, a facile and scalable approach has been developed to synthesize hollow sodium sulfide (Na2S) nanospheres embedded in a highly hierarchical and spongy conductive carbon matrix, forming an intriguing architecture similar to the morphology of frogspawn coral, which has shown great potential as a cathode for high-rate performance RT Na–S batteries. The shortened Na-ion diffusion pathway benefits from the hollow structures together with the fast electron transfer from the carbon matrix contributes to high electrochemical reactivity, leading to superior electrochemical performance at various current rates. At high current densities of 1.4 and 2.1 A g−1, high initial discharge capacities of 980 and 790 mAh g−1sulfur can be achieved, respectively, with reversible capacities stabilized at 600 and 400 mAh g−1sulfur after 100 cycles. As a proof of concept, a Na-metal-free Na–S battery is demonstrated by pairing the hollow Na2S cathode with tin-based anode.

Nonlithium Metal–Sulfur Batteries: Steps Toward a Leap,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimPresent mobile devices, transportation tools, and renewable energy technologies are more dependent on newly developed battery chemistries than ever before. Intrinsic properties, such as safety, high energy density, and cheapness, are the main objectives of rechargeable batteries that have driven their overall technological progress over the past several decades. Unfortunately, it is extremely hard to achieve all these merits simultaneously at present. Alternatively, exploration of the most suitable batteries to meet the specific requirements of an individual application tends to be a more reasonable and easier choice now and in the near future. Based on this concept, here, a range of promising alternatives to lithium–sulfur batteries that are constructed with non-Li metal anodes (e.g., Na, K, Mg, Ca, and Al) and sulfur cathodes are discussed. The systems governed by these new chemistries offer high versatility in meeting the specific requirements of various applications, which is directly linked with the broad choice in battery chemistries, materials, and systems.

Fe-MOF derived jujube pit like Fe3O4/C composite as sulfur host for lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdLi-S batteries have shown great potential for next generation energy storage due to the high theoretical specific capacity and low cost. However, the issues of shuttle effect of polysulfide, poor conductivity of sulfur, and volume expansion during lithiation/delithiation seriously restrict the development of Li-S batteries. Inspired by the strong chemical absorption between metal oxides and polysulfides, a jujube pit like Fe3O4/C composite derived from iron-based metal-organic framework (Fe-MOF) are applied as efficient sulfur host in Li-S batteries in this work. Benefitting from the strong chemical bond between iron ion and polysulfides, as well as the interaction between oxygen anion and lithium ion, the Fe3O4/C composite can immobilize the sulfur and inhibit the diffusion of polysulfides efficiently. In addition, the carbon component not only improves the electrical conductivity, but also serves as buffer layer to accommodate the volume variation upon charging/discharging. Consequently, such Fe3O4/C/S cathode shows a high initial specific capacity of 1324 mAh/g at a current density of 0.05 C and could retain a specific capacity of 642 mAh/g after 300 cycles at current density of 1 C, corresponding to a low fading rate of 0.072% per cycle.",Electrochimica Acta
Optimization of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic electrolyte and interface for high performance solid-state sodium battery,"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Poor ionic conductivity of solid-state electrolyte (SE) and high interface resistances between the SE and electrodes are two major challenges for solid-state sodium batteries (SSBs). In this work, an integrate strategy is proposed for improving the ionic conductivity of SE and reducing the interfacial resistance between SE and cathode. The pure-phase Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) is prepared by optimizing the composition ratios of the starting materials and is applied as SE for SSBs. The as-prepared NZSP SE achieves a relatively high ionic conductivity of 1.935 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C and a good electrochemical stability up to 5 V vs. Na+/Na. The solid-state Na|NZSP|Na symmetrical cell can perform a consistent cycling for 70 h, indicating the excellent chemical and electrochemical stability for SE and SE/Na interface. A composite cathode is fabricated using NZSP and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) particles. The sodiated Nafion is particularly applied as the interface modifier for the cathode to facilitate the ionic contact. At 25 °C, the SSB with NZSP SE and the composite cathode modified by sodiated Nafion delivers a discharge capacity of 81.6 mA h g−1 at the current density of 20 mA g−1 and retains a high capacity of 62.23 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. These results indicate that optimization of the NZSP electrolyte and the NZSP/NVP interface is an efficient method to achieve the high-performance SSB.",Ceramics International
Core-Shell Structured S@Co(OH)2 with a Carbon-Nanofiber Interlayer: A Conductive Cathode with Suppressed Shuttling Effect for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.Rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries are potential candidates for storing electrochemical energy because of their extremely high energy density. However, their practical applications are prohibited by the sluggish charge transfer, the retarding Li ion diffusion, and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides. We report here a high-performance cathode material in which a S submicrosphere with a mass fraction of 80% was encapsulated within a permeable Co(OH)2 nanoshell which functions as a physical barrier preventing the sulfur and polysulfides from leaking into the electrolyte and also contributes to the catalytic decomposition of polysulfides during the charge and discharge process. When an interlayer of carbon nanofibers is introduced between the S@Co(OH)2 cathode and the separator, the performance of the Li-S batteries can be further significantly enhanced. Specifically, the S@Co(OH)2 cathode possesses good cycling stability over 1000 cycles with an initial discharge capacity of 1100 mAh g-1 at 2 C and a reversible capacity of 606 mAh g-1. In particular, without the LiNO3 additive, this S@Co(OH)2 cathode also exhibits a Coulombic efficiency as high as 85%, just a little lower than that of commercial electrolyte with LiNO3 additive. Relevant mechanistic studies revealed that such superior performances are attributed to the enhanced internal electrical and ionic conductivity and suppressed shuttling effect, owing to the presence of the Co(OH)2 shell and the carbon-nanofiber interlayer. Theoretical simulations based on density functional theory were also carried out to figure out the interaction between the Co(OH)2 nanosheets and the polysulfides. It revealed that the Co(OH)2 nanoshell, rather than merely working as a physical barrier to trap the polysulfides, could also adsorb polysulfides and catalyze their decomposition during the cycling process, further helping to suppress the shuttling effect.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Long-Life Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries by Virtue of Transition-Metal-Nanocluster–Sulfur Interactions,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries hold significant promise for large-scale application because of low cost of both sodium and sulfur. However, the dissolution of polysulfides into the electrolyte limits practical application. Now, the design and testing of a new class of sulfur hosts as transition-metal (Fe, Cu, and Ni) nanoclusters (ca. 1.2 nm) wreathed on hollow carbon nanospheres (S@M-HC) for RT-Na/S batteries is reported. A chemical couple between the metal nanoclusters and sulfur is hypothesized to assist in immobilization of sulfur and to enhance conductivity and activity. S@Fe-HC exhibited an unprecedented reversible capacity of 394 mAh g −1 despite 1000 cycles at 100 mA g −1 , together with a rate capability of 220 mAh g −1 at a high current density of 5 A g −1 . DFT calculations underscore that these metal nanoclusters serve as electrocatalysts to rapidly reduce Na 2 S 4 into short-chain sulfides and thereby obviate the shuttle effect.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition

Pillared MXene with Ultralarge Interlayer Spacing as a Stable Matrix for High Performance Sodium Metal Anodes,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium (Na) metal is a promising alternative to lithium metal as an anode material for the next-generation energy storage systems due to its high theoretical capacity, low cost, and natural abundance. However, dendritic/mossy Na growth caused by uncontrollable plating/stripping results in serious safe concerns and rapid electrode degradation. This study presents Sn2+ pillared Ti3C2 MXene serving as a stable matrix for high-performance dendrite-free Na metal anode. The intercalated Sn2+ between Ti3C2 layers not only induces Na to nucleate and grow within Ti3C2 interlayers, but also endows the Ti3C2 with larger interlayer space to accommodate the deposited Na by taking advantage of the “pillar effect,” contributing to uniform Na deposition. As a result, the pillar-structured MXene-based Na metal electrode could enable high current density (up to 10 mA cm−2) along with high areal capacity (up to 5 mAh cm−2) over long-term cycling (up to 500 cycles). The full cell using MXene-based Na metal anode exhibits superior electrochemical performance than that using host-less commercial Na. It is believed that the well-controlled MXene-based Na anode not only extends the application scope of MXene, but also provides guidance in designing high-performance Na metal batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
Enhanced Interfacial Stability of Hybrid-Electrolyte Lithium-Sulfur Batteries with a Layer of Multifunctional Polymer with Intrinsic Nanoporosity,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe use of lithium-ion conductive solid electrolytes offers a promising approach to address the polysulfide shuttle and the lithium-dendrite problems in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. One critical issue with the development of solid-electrolyte Li-S batteries is the electrode–electrolyte interfaces. Herein, a strategic approach is presented by employing a thin layer of a polymer with intrinsic nanoporosity (PIN) on a Li+-ion conductive solid electrolyte, which significantly enhances the ionic interfaces between the electrodes and the solid electrolyte. Among the various types of Li+-ion solid electrolytes, NASICON-type Li1+ xAlxTi2- x(PO4)3 (LATP) offers advantages in terms of Li+-ion conductivity, stability in ambient environment, and practical viability. However, LATP is susceptible to reaction with both the Li-metal anode and polysulfides in Li-S batteries due to the presence of easily reducible Ti4+ ions in it. The coating with a thin layer of PIN presented in this study overcomes the above issues. At the negative-electrode side, the PIN layer prevents the direct contact of Li-metal with the LATP solid electrolyte, circumventing the reduction of LATP by Li metal. At the positive electrode side, the PIN layer prevents the migration of polysulfides to the surface of LATP, preventing the reduction of LATP by polysulfides.",Advanced Functional Materials
Tortuosity Effects in Garnet-Type Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 Solid Electrolytes,"© 2018 American Chemical Society. Intrinsic material microstructure features, such as pores or void spaces, grains, and defects can affect local lithium-ion concentration profiles and transport properties in solid ion conductors. The formation of lithium-deficient or -excess regions can accelerate degradation phenomena, such as dendrite formation, lithium plating, and electrode/electrolyte delamination. This paper evaluates the effects pores or void spaces have on the tortuosity of a garnet-type Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 solid electrolyte. Synchrotron X-ray tomography is used to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of different electrolytes sintered at temperatures between 1050 and 1150 °C. The magnitude of the electrolyte tortuosity and the tortuosity directional anisotropy is shown to increase with sintering temperature. Electrolytes with highly anisometric tortuosity have lower critical current densities. Alignment or elimination of pores within an electrolyte or composite cathode may provide a means for achieving higher critical current densities and higher power densities in all solid-state batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
A liquid metal-based self-adaptive sulfur-gallium composite for long-cycling lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been regarded as a promising candidate for energy storage owing to their ultrahigh theoretical capacity and low cost. However, the commercial application of Li-S batteries has been plagued by the huge volume change of sulfur, the insulative nature of solid active materials (S and Li 2 S) and the polysulfide shuttle. Here, a uniform sulfur-gallium core-shell structure (S@Ga) with an ultrathin liquid gallium shell was prepared by harnessing the reaction between sulfur and gallium via a facile mixing process. In this S@Ga composite, the thin gallium shell not only exhibits the self-adaptive characteristic to perfectly adapt to the varying volume change of sulfur, restraining the polysulfide shuttle, but also acts as a conductive agent to enhance the electronic/ion transmission, improving the rate capacity of the S@Ga cathode. Therefore, the resultant S@Ga cathode exhibits a high capacity of 1295 mA h g -1 at 0.1C and a high cycling stability with a small decay of 0.043% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 1C.",Nanoscale

"FTIR, thermal and ionic conductivity studies of nanocomposite polymer electrolytes","© 2019 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.In this study, proton-conducting nanocomposite plasticized polymer electrolytes based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) complexed with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HCF3SO3) plasticized with propylene carbonate (PC) and dispersed with nanosized fumed silica (SiO2) have been prepared through the solution-casting technique. The ionic conductivity of electrolytes was measured as a function of acid, plasticizer and fumed silica concentrations. A maximum ionic conductivity of 3·31 × 10-4 S/cm for PMMA + 10 wt% trifluoromethanesulfonic acid polymer electrolytes and 5·37 × 10-3 S/cm for plasticized polymer electrolytes containing 50 wt% PC has been observed at room temperature. The viscosity percolation threshold for nanocomposite polymer electrolytes was observed at 3 wt% concentration of fumed silica with ionic conductivity of 8·84 × 10-3 S/cm at room temperature. Fourier transform infrared studies suggested the complexation of constituents of the electrolytes, formation of ion aggregates in unplasticized polymer electrolytes and dissociation of ion aggregates with the addition of the plasticizer in plasticized polymer electrolytes. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis studies proved that these electrolytes are thermally stable only up to 130°C. The conductivity shows negligible change with temperature from 30 to 130°C and time of 30 d, which is desirable for their use in practical applications such solid-state batteries, fuel cells, sensors and supercapacitors.",Surface Innovations
Applications of 2D MXenes in energy conversion and storage systems,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes), a family of two-dimensional (2D) inorganic compounds, are materials composed of a few atomic layers of transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides. Ti3C2, the first 2D layered MXene, was isolated in 2011. This material, which is a layered bulk material analogous to graphite, was derived from its 3D phase, Ti3AlC2 MAX. Since then, material scientists have either determined or predicted the stable phases of >200 different MXenes based on combinations of various transition metals such as Ti, Mo, V, Cr, and their alloys with C and N.

The potential of MXenes for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in water, such as dye waste, is also addressed, along with their promise as catalysts for ammonium synthesis from nitrogen. Finally, their application potential is summarized.",Chemical Society Reviews
"Smart Merit Combination of Sulfur, Selenium and Electrode Engineering to Build Better Sustainable Li-Storage Batteries","© 2018 American Chemical Society.Given the giant theoretical capacity and great natural abundance of sulfur (S), Li-S batteries have been regarded as one of the most promising sustainable power sources in the future. However, they have to suffer from issues of short cyclic lifespan, low Coulombic efficiency, and poor rate behaviors unfortunately due to the insulating nature for S actives and negative polysulfide intermediates dissolution. As a congener, the conducting selenium (Se) shows the similar Li-storage chemistry to S, with comparable volumetric capacity, superb rate capability, but unluckily low gravimetric capacity and limited cyclic life. To build sustained power systems with preferable behaviors, we put forward an efficient battery promotion strategy by combining merits of S, Se and smart electrode engineering. Herein, Se and S are successively infused into a carbon black (CB) matrix and further packaged by thin nickel nitrate hydroxide layers (S/SeNNH) so as to suppress the actives diffusion losses. Such integrated S/SeNNH hybrids well inherit the superiorities of S, Se and benefit from the integrated electrode design, capable of showing high reversible specific capacities (∼913 mAh g-1), excellent rate capability and cyclic stability (almost 100% Coulombic efficiency), and greatly prolonged lifetime. Our present work may provide an efficient, scalable, and applicable way to develop reliable and superior cathodes for sustainable Li-storage applications.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
Mechanically enhanced electrical conductivity of polydimethylsiloxane-based composites by a hot embossing process,"© 2019 by the authors.Electrically conductive polymer composites are in high demand for modern technologies, however, the intrinsic brittleness of conducting conjugated polymers and the moderate electrical conductivity of engineering polymer/carbon composites have highly constrained their applications. In this work, super high electrical conductive polymer composites were produced by a novel hot embossing design. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composites containing short carbon fiber (SCF) exhibited an electrical percolation threshold at 0.45 wt % and reached a saturated electrical conductivity of 49 S/m at 8 wt % of SCF. When reducing the sample thickness from 1.0 to 0.1 mm by the hot embossing process, a compression-induced percolation threshold occurred at 0.3 wt %, while the electrical conductivity was further enhanced to 378 S/m at 8 wt % SCF. Furthermore, the addition of a second nanofiller of 1 wt %, such as carbon nanotube or conducting carbon black, further increased the electrical conductivity of the PDMS/SCF (8 wt %) composites to 909 S/m and 657 S/m, respectively. The synergy of the densified conducting filler network by the mechanical compression and the hierarchical micro-/nano-scale filler approach has realized super high electrically conductive, yet mechanically flexible, polymer composites for modern flexible electronics applications.",Polymers

It is here that 2D materials, due to the large number of favorable properties such as high surface area, elevated electrical and thermal conductivities, and enhanced chemical and mechanical stability are deemed to play a very important role. Also, novel fabrication techniques have been developed which aim to greatly tailor and take advantage of the variety of fascinating morphology and layered structures that 2D materials provide. It is the also expected that a combination of 2D materials, as a hybrid, will further enhance the overall electrochemical performance. Recent studies along those lines have demonstrated, synergistic effects between graphene and other 2D materials including transition metal dichalcogenides, MXenes, and phosphorene based anodes have been observed. In this chapter, applications and performances of graphene-based 2D hybrid anodes for advanced nonlithium batteries (sodium-ion, potassium-ion, and magnesium-ion battery systems) is presented.",2D Nanomaterials for Energy Applications: Graphene and Beyond

Spatially controlled synthesis of superlattice-like SnS/nitrogen-doped graphene hybrid nanobelts as high-rate and durable anode materials for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising for large-scale energy storage because of the low cost and earth abundance of sodium. Although tin monosulfide (SnS) has attracted broad interest in SIBs due to its layered structure and large capacity, the sluggish sodiation kinetics, substantial volumetric variation, and electrochemical dissolution of intermediate polysulfides during cycling hinder its practical implementation. Herein, we report a spatially confined synthesis of superlattice-like SnS/N-doped graphene (NG) hybrids composed of alternately stacked SnS and NG nanosheets as high-rate and long-life anode materials for SIBs. The density functional theory calculations reveal the enhanced densities of states (DOSs) near the Fermi level and increased interfacial conductivity for the SnS/NG heterostructured nanobelts. In SnS/NG hybrids, the SnS is sandwiched between the NG layers enabling enlarged SnS interlayer spacing and a strong built-in field between adjacent SnS and NG, which facilitates the Na-ion diffusion and sodiation/desodiation reactions with rapid kinetics. Moreover, the conductive NG layers not only improve the conductivity in the composite but also provide the 2D confined interspace to accommodate the volume variation of SnS and mitigate polysulfide effusion and shuttling during cycling to yield excellent cycling stability. Consequently, the superlattice-like SnS/NG hybrid shows a large capacity of 600 mA h g-1 at 1600 mA g-1, a high rate capability of 550 mA h g-1 at 14 580 mA g-1 and an excellent cycling stability with 0.004% decay per cycle for over 1200 cycles, outperforming the reported sulfides so far. The full cell with the SnS/NG anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode has a large energy density of 160 W h kg-1 and good cycling stability, demonstrating promising applications in electrochemical energy storage.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

First, the focus is put on materials, either Li+, Na+ or Ag+ conducting ones, with the most striking points being the discovery of ion conducting chalcogenide glasses in the 1980s, the elaboration of fast ion conducting glass-ceramics with the introduction of mechanical alloying techniques in the 1990s, and more recently the renewed interest in Na+ conducting glasses and glass-ceramics. The second part of the chapter focuses on the development of all-solid-state batteries, Li-ion and Li/S batteries and to a lesser extent Na+ and Ag+-ion batteries.

Sulfur-Based Electrodes that Function via Multielectron Reactions for Room-Temperature Sodium-Ion Storage Schwefel-basierte Elektroden mit Mehrelektronenreaktionen für Raumtemperatur-Natriumionenspeicherung,"© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Emerging rechargeable sodium-ion storage systems—sodium-ion and room-temperature sodium–sulfur (RT-NaS) batteries—are gaining extensive research interest as low-cost options for large-scale energy-storage applications. Owing to their abundance, easy accessibility, and unique physical and chemical properties, sulfur-based materials, in particular metal sulfides (MSx) and elemental sulfur (S), are currently regarded as promising electrode candidates for Na-storage technologies with high capacity and excellent redox reversibility based on multielectron conversion reactions.

Diphenyl polysulfides: Cathodes with excellent lithiation performance and high specific energy for LSBs,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Reversible lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are considered one of the most promising next-generation energy storage systems. However, the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfide significantly weakens the electrochemical properties and the cycle life, hindering its practical application. Organo-sulfides are unique materials with low cost, profuse content and high capacity. Here, via quantum chemical calculations, we introduce a class of diphenyl polysulfides, PhSnPh (2 ≤ n ≤ 15), which are all structurally stable, confirmed by calculation of their Gibbs free energies. The theoretical specific energy of PhS15Ph is high, up to 2632 W h kg-1, exceeding that of S8. By calculating the bond dissociation energy of S-S in PhSnPh molecules, we analyze the breaking processes of the S-S bonds in each step of lithiation. The microscopic mechanism of the fast reaction kinetics of PhSnPh cathodes is explored. It is phenyl that prevents the formation of soluble long-chain polysulfide molecules (Li2S4, Li2S6, Li2S8) in the lithiation process, efficiently weakening the ""shuttle effect"".",RSC Advances
"Layer-by-layer stacked nanohybrids of N,S-co-doped carbon film modified atomic MoS2 nanosheets for advanced sodium dual-ion batteries","This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sodium dual-ion batteries (SDIBs) have received tremendous research attention due to their multiple advantages of environmental friendliness and high working voltages. However, the development of high-performance SDIBs still remains a daunting challenge, mainly due to the lack of robust anode materials with sufficient interlayer spacing for Na+ insertion/extraction. We here report a solvothermal method for the fabrication of coral-like nanohybrids that are constructed from layer-by-layer stacked nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon film modified atomic MoS2 nanosheets (a-MoS2NS@NSCfilm). Comprehensive characterization demonstrates that a-MoS2NS@NSCfilm shows favorable electrochemical and structural properties for sodium ion storage, including significantly improved electrical conductivity and an expanded layer space of 0.95 nm thanks to carbon film modification, which favorably facilitate electron transfer and enhance Na+ diffusion kinetics, thus leading to an impressive capability for fast and high-capacity sodium storage. We further verify the practical application of a-MoS2NS@NSCfilm as an anode for SDIBs by coupling it with an expanded graphite (EG) cathode; this delivers a capacity of 40 mA h g-1 with outstanding cycling stability and an extremely low capacity decay of 0.0056% per cycle after 5000 cycles at 10C.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Tin nanoparticles embedded in a carbon buffer layer as preferential nucleation sites for stable sodium metal anodes,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sodium (Na) metal is one of the most appealing anode materials for grid-scale energy storage systems owing to the high earth abundance and low cost of Na resources. Nevertheless, the implementation of the Na metal anode is hindered by two primary issues associated with Na dendrite growth and volume expansion, resulting in low coulombic efficiency and poor cycle life. Herein we present a facile and scalable method to synthesize tin (Sn) nanoparticles (NPs) that are uniformly embedded within a carbon network (denoted as Sn@C composite), which can address the two issues simultaneously. Specifically, Sn NPs can serve as preferential nucleation sites to guide Na nucleation and thereby lower the Na deposition overpotential, while the carbon network can act as a buffer layer to effectively minimize the volume change and alleviate the exfoliation of Sn NPs over repeated cycles. Consequently, high-capacity Na anodes can be realized with long-term reversibility and stability. Moreover, a room-temperature Na-sulfur battery based on the Sn@C composite as an anode coupled with commercial sodium sulfide as a cathode was demonstrated to have significantly improved electrochemical performance. We believe that this work provides a new pathway for designing high-energy Na metal batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Optimized synthesis of ultrahigh-surface-area and oxygen-doped carbon nanobelts for high cycle-stability lithium-sulfur batteries,"© The Electrochemical SocietyHierarchical clews of carbon nanobelts (CsCNBs) with ultrahigh specific surface area (2300 m2 g−1) and large pore volume (up to 1.29 cm3 g−1) has been successfully fabricated through carbonization and KOH activation of phenolic resin based nanobelts. The product possesses hierarchically porous structure, three-dimensional conductive network framework, and polar oxygen-rich groups, which are very befitting to load sulfur leading to excellent cycling stability of lithium-sulfur batteries. The composites of CsCNBs/sulfur exhibit an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 1245 mA h g−1 and ultralow capacity decay rate as low as 0.162% per cycle after 200 cycles at 0.1 C. Even at high current rate of 4 C, the cells still display a high initial discharge capacity (621 mA h g−1) and ultralow capacity decay rate (only 0.039% per cycle) after 1000 cycles. These encouraging results indicate that polar oxygen-containing functional groups are important for improving the electrochemical performance of carbons. The oxygen-doped carbon nanobelts have excellent energy storage potential in the field of energy storage.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
Ti-based electrode materials for electrochemical sodium ion storage and removal,"This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.Owing to the natural abundance and high safety, electrochemical sodium-ion storage and removal devices are considered as promising candidates for large-scale energy storage and water purification systems. When used as the key component of sodium ion batteries (SIBs), sodium ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs), and capacitive deionization (CDI) devices, the electrode architecture and composition need to be precisely designed to achieve high capacity, rate performance, and long life span. Among various sodium hosting materials, titanium-based electrodes have been intensively investigated owing to their appropriate operating voltage, small strain expansion, fast rate capability, environmental friendliness, safety, and low costs. In this review, we discuss the progress of Ti-based electrode materials over the last two years, covering their classification and key factors (electrical conductivity, ion diffusion, volume variation, capacity and operating voltage) of the electrode design for SIB, SIHC, and CDI applications. The architectural concepts, synthesis methods, and microstructural and compositional control of Ti-based electrodes are also discussed. Our perspectives on current impediments and the future research direction are finally discussed. This review inspires us to propose new chemical strategies that can greatly improve the electrochemical performance.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
The influence of silica surface groups on the Li-ion conductivity of LiBH4/SiO2 nanocomposites,"This journal is © the Owner Societies.Lithium borohydride is a promising lithium ion conductor for all-solid-state batteries. However, the compound only exhibits high ionic conductivity at elevated temperatures, typically above 110 °C. It was shown that the addition of oxides such as silica or alumina increases the room temperature ionic conductivity by 3 orders of magnitude. The origin of this remarkable effect is not yet well understood. Here, we investigate the influence of oxide surface groups on the ionic conductivity of LiBH4/SiO2 nanocomposites. We systematically varied the density and nature of the surface groups of mesoporous silica by heat treatment at different temperatures, or surface functionalization, and subsequently prepared LiBH4/SiO2 nanocomposites by melt infiltration. The ionic conductivity is strongly influenced by the heat treatment temperature, hence the density of the free surface silanol groups. Replacing some of the silanol groups with hydrophobic surface groups resulted in an order of magnitude reduction of the room temperature ionic conductivity, suggesting that their presence is crucial to obtain high ionic conductivity in the nanocomposites. This systematic study and insight provide a basis for further exploration of the impact of surface groups, and for the rational design of novel solid-state nanocomposite electrolytes via interface engineering.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
"Polysulfide reduction and oxidation at MoS2, WS2 and Cu-doped MoS2 thin film electrodes","© 2019 The Electrochemical Society.The sluggish kinetics of cyclic polysulfide electrochemistry, where sulfur species typically range from S2 2− to S6 2−, presents a challenge in several common electrochemical systems. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides such as WS2 and MoS2 have been proposed for catalysis of polysulfide oxidation-reduction. Here electrodeposited WS2, MoS2, and Cu-doped MoS2 thin films are tested for 24 h cycling in an electrolyte containing 1.8 M Na2Sx + 1.0 M NaOH. Although their initial catalytic activity is high, electrodeposited WS2 films delaminated after ∼4 h. The initial catalytic activity of MoS2 films is also high, but MoS2 gradually transforms to Mo2S3 during 24 h of polysulfide oxidation-reduction cycling, as shown by X-ray diffraction (XRD), cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The best results were obtained for Cu-doped MoS2, which exhibited both high catalytic activity and stable polarization curves during 24 h of potential cycling. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of MoS2 stabilization during cyclic polysulfide electrochemistry through incorporation of a metal dopant into MoS2",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
A high-energy potassium-sulfur battery enabled by facile and effective imidazole-solvated copper catalysts,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The potassium-sulfur (K-S) battery is a promising low-cost energy storage technology; however, its development is limited by a low achievable capacity (∼560 mAh gS-1) and a low average cell voltage (typically <1.5 V) owing to the formation of thermodynamic traps (K2S3) and sluggish reduction kinetics. In this study, we design a facile and effective homogeneous catalyst, 1-methylimidazole (Me-Im) solvated-copper, to promote the reduction kinetics of K2S3 to K2S, achieving a high reversible sulfur capacity of 922 mAh gS-1 with a high average cell voltage of 1.93 V, corresponding to a gravimetric energy of 1779 Wh kgS-1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and density functional theory calculation elucidated the working mechanism of the Me-Im-solvated Cu catalyst toward weakening the S-S bond in K2S3 and promoting the formation of K2S. This work provides a key strategy to achieve high-energy reversible potassium-sulfur batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Mechanochemical synthesis of fast sodium ion conductor Na11Sn2PSe12 enables first sodium-selenium all-solid-state battery,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Fast sodium ion conducting Na11Sn2PSe12 solid electrolyte was prepared by a mechanochemical method. This is the first tin based selenide prepared by room temperature ball milling instead of conventional synthesis in a sealed quartz tube under vacuum. Our approach is safe and easy to scale up. Samples were synthesized systematically using various intervals of ball milling and annealing time to maximise phase purity and ionic conductivity. The highest room temperature bulk ionic conductivity of the mechanochemically synthesized Na11Sn2PSe12 was 1.0 mS cm-1 observed for a sample prepared by ball milling for 15 h followed by 6 h annealing at 550 °C. This fast-ion conducting Na11Sn2PSe12 allowed to demonstrate the first Na-Se all-solid-state batteries Na/Na11Sn2PSe12/C-Se and Na3Sn/Na11Sn2PSe12/C-Se with specific initial discharge capacities of 430 mA h g-1 or 400 mA h g-1, respectively at a current density 0.08 mA cm-2.

Sulfur-functionalized vanadium carbide MXene (V2CS2) as a promising anchoring material for lithium-sulfur batteries,"This journal is © the Owner Societies.The development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is hindered by capacity loss due to lithium polysulfide (LIPS) dissolution into electrolyte solutions (known as the ""shuttle effect""). MXenes with excellent electrical conductivity, high mechanical strength and multiple possible active two-dimensional surface terminations are attracting much attention as anchoring materials of Li-S batteries. Here, the S-functionalized V2C (V2CS2) is designed and demonstrated to have not only dynamic and thermal stability, but also metallic character. Compared with bare V2C and V2CO2, V2CS2 exhibits a moderate adsorption effect to suppress the ""shuttle effect"" and can preserve the structure of LIPSs without any decomposition. Moreover, the metallic properties of V2CS2 are maintained after LIPSs are adsorbed, which can promote the electrochemical activity during the charge and discharge process. The low energy barriers of Li2S decomposition and Li diffusion on the V2CS2 surface promise the phase transformation of LIPSs and assist the electrochemical process. Based on these remarkable results, we can conclude that V2CS2 is a promising anchoring material for lithium-sulfur batteries. Our work may also inspire the exploration of other MXenes and new surface functionalization methods to improve the performance of MXenes as host materials for high performance Li-S batteries.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Facile and scalable synthesis of low-cost FeS@C as long-cycle anodes for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sodium ion batteries have attracted extensive attention due to their earth-abundant elements and potential for low cost. Iron-based materials not only satisfy these demands but also have high theoretical capacities and are of great commercial value. It is, therefore, necessary to conquer the problems of iron sulfide, including the synthesis method and insufficient cycle stability, from a practical perspective; however, only a few studies have focused on these points. In this work, FeS nanocrystals embedded in a carbon network (FeS@C) were prepared by a homogeneous carbothermal reduction strategy. The advantages of this preparation method are as follows: (1) low-cost and abundant raw materials, (2) green synthesis method without releasing sulfide, (3) simple production processes, and (4) easy large-scale production. The as-synthesized FeS@C demonstrates a long cycle life (97.6%, 3000 cycles) with relatively high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), high capacity, and excellent rate capacity. The application of FeS@C was further confirmed via a pouch full cell.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Diversities of stoichiometry and electrical conductivity in sodium sulfides,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Aiming at developing and understanding the active materials in the renewable energy-storage sodium-sulfur (Na-S) system, we systemically explored the phase diversity, electronic properties, and chemical bonding of the Na-S system at ambient and high pressure up to 50 GPa, using a combination of first-principles calculations with extensive structural searches. We identified four new stable phases; Na3S, Na5S3, Na2S2 and Na2S3. The previously unidentified Na2S3 with S32- polyanions shows Pnma symmetry with quite a low formation enthalpy relative to Na2S2 and Na2S4. The simulated voltage through Na2S4 to generate Na2S3 in a battery is predicted to be 1.65 V, consistent with previous measurements. The predicted tetragonal Na5S3 with infinite S chains has mixed valence states of sulfur atoms, which was first observed in alkali metal sulfides. Na3S exhibits a potential one-dimensional (1-D) electride with the chemical formula of [Na3S]+·e-, where the sulfur atoms possess the highest coordination number (Na12S). Both Na3S and Na5S3 exhibit intrinsic metallic behaviors, clearly differing from other semiconducting phases. A detailed analysis of the electronic structure reveals the distinct electrical pathways of a 1-D electron gas in the channel voids in Na3S and infinite sulfur chains with metallic S-S bonding in Na5S3. Our results may help to discover new candidates in Na-S systems and elucidate the potential electrochemical mechanism in the Na-S battery.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Deeply Nesting Zinc Sulfide Dendrites in Tertiary Hierarchical Structure for Potassium Ion Batteries: Enhanced Conductivity from Interior to Exterior,"© 2019 American Chemical Society.Transition metal sulfides are deemed as attractive anode materials for potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) due to their high theoretical capacities based on conversion and alloying reaction. However, the main challenges are the low electronic conductivity, huge volume expansion, and consequent formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) upon potassiation/depotassiation. Herein, zinc sulfide dendrites deeply nested in the tertiary hierarchical structure through a solvothermal-pyrolysis process are designed as an anode material for KIBs. The tertiary hierarchical structure is composed of the primary ultrafine ZnS nanorods, the secondary carbon nanosphere, and the tertiary carbon-encapsulated ZnS subunits nanosphere structure. The architectural design of this material provides a stable diffusion path and enhances effective conductivity from the interior to exterior for both K+ ions and electrons, buffers the volume expansion, and constructs a stable SEI during cycling. A stable specific capacity of 330 mAh g-1 is achieved after 100 cycles at the current density of 50 mA g-1 and 208 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1 over 300 cycles. Using density functional theory calculations, we discover the interactions between ZnS and carbon interface can effectively decrease the K+ ions diffusion barrier and therefore promote the reversibility of K+ ions storage.",ACS Nano
General Approach to Produce Nanostructured Binary Transition Metal Selenides as High-Performance Sodium Ion Battery Anodes,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimMultiple transition metals containing chalcogenides have recently drawn boosted attraction as anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Their greatly enhanced electrochemical performances can be attributed to the superior intrinsic conductivities and richer redox reactions, comparative to mono metal chalcogenides. To employ various binary metals comprising selenides (B-TMSs) for SIBs, discovery of a simplistic, scalable and universal synthesis approach is highly desirable. Herein, a simple, facile, and comprehensive strategy to produce various combinations of nanostructured B-TMSs is presented. As a proof of concept, optimized, high surface area bearing, and hierarchical nanosheets of iron–nickel selenide (FNSe), iron–cobalt selenide, and nickel–cobalt selenide are produced and employed in SIBs. These B-TMSs exhibit adequately high energy capacities, excellent rate capabilities, and an extraordinarily stable life of 2600 cycles. As far as it is known, it is the first work to discuss sodium storage of FNSe, so various in situ and ex situ battery analyses are carried out to probe the sodium storage mechanism. When employed in sodium full batteries, these B-TMSs present reasonably high reversible specific capacities even after 100 cycles. Overall, the presented strategy will pave the way for facile synthesis of numerous binary transition metal chalcogenides that are the potential materials for energy storage and conversion systems.",Small

The insulating properties of the sulfur and shuttle effect of the polysulfides during charge/discharge process limit its commercial application. In this work, we prepared a hierarchical N/P co-doped porous carbon (DPC) via NH4H2PO4 and KHCO3 dual-activation of the porous carbon, which was obtained by annealing of nano-calcium carbonate/sucrose composites. The resulting DPC/S composite as cathode materials for LSBs shows a promising long-term cycling stability (968.9 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C) and rate performance (624.4 mAh g−1 at 1 C, 545.4 mAh g−1 at 2 C). The structural superiority of DPC host materials, i.e., highly porous structure, hierarchical pores and N/P co-doping contributes to the superior electrochemical performance of the materials.

Investigation of the electrochemical and thermal stability of an ionic liquid based Na0.6Co0.1Mn0.9O2/Na2.55V6O16 sodium-ion full-cell,"© 2019 The Electrochemical Society.Electrolytes based on non-flammable and electrochemically and thermally stable ionic liquids (ILs) are rendered promising alternatives to the conventionally applied organic electrolytes for lithium as well as sodium ion batteries (SIBs). In this study the electrochemical performance and thermal stability of a SIB full-cell containing an IL based electrolyte is evaluated and compared to a reference system employing a conventional organic electrolyte. Compatibility of the IL electrolyte with the electrode materials Na0.6Co0.1Mn0.9O2 (NMO) and Na2.55V6O16 (NVO) is assured by SIB half-cell studies. In NMO/NVO full-cells the IL electrolyte outperforms the organic electrolyte in terms of cycling stability and columbic efficiency, reaching a retention of 76% after 100 cycles. Studies at 75°C show that, in contrast to the system based on the organic electrolyte, the IL-based SIB is capable of operating at elevated temperatures. Further, for the first time the superior safety of an IL-based SIB full-cell over the organic analogue is proven using Accelerating Rate Calorimetry (ARC) underlining the benefits of the IL based electrolyte.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
Interpenetrating-Syncretic Micro-Nano Hierarchy Fibers for Effective Fine Particle Capture,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimIn nature, valuable and essential multilevel hierarchy structures are common in microstructures and macrostructures. Researchers try to emulate these unique structures or obtain inspiration from them. In general, materials with a single structure are easy to prepare but it is difficult to achieve multiple functions or performances simultaneously. Here, a facile method with general applicability and a high yield for preparing interpenetrating-syncretic micro-nanocomposite fibers with a multilevel hierarchy structure via bicomponent electrostatic-centrifugal spinning is introduced. This 3D structure is distinctive and differs from previous micro-nanocomposite structure, in which nanofibers are embedded through microfibers. The formation of a longer, more complex and diversified path is close to undulating surface, mainly because of microfiber introduction. Those characteristics in favor of improving the capture rate of particle on the surface. Two different preparation routes are designed. By controlling the spinning parameters, samples with an outstanding filtering efficiency, a low pressure drop, a high quality factor, an optical transparency, and an excellent impact resistant are constructed. Because the different fiber diameters assume different functions, this work could be used to construct diverse materials by using suitable polymers in other fields that require different fiber sizes and a solid multilevel hierarchy structure to improve the mechanical properties and corresponding performance.",Advanced Engineering Materials

This study presents a simple and scalable synthesis of pyrite (FeS 2 ) starting from S and Fe powders, which involves high-energy ball milling of precursor powders followed by a thermal treatment. The formation of the desired product was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. After the synthesis, spherical FeS 2 nanoparticles of ~ 85 nm in size were obtained, with a highly crystalline face-centered cubic structure and no secondary phases. The synthesized material was tested as cathode material for lithium batteries. The cathodes delivered good electrochemical lithium storage properties, such as a reversible capacity as high as 470 mAh g −1 even after 120 cycles and a good rate capability. Furthermore, aspects regarding the reaction mechanism and common electrochemical features of Li/FeS 2 batteries are discussed.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry
Confining ultrasmall bimetallic alloys in porous N-carbon for use as scalable and sustainable electrocatalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.This paper demonstrates a rational protocol for the synthesis of ultrasmall bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (FeCo, FeNi, and NiCo; <4 nm) anchored on biomass-processed porous N-carbon as oxygen electrocatalysts via a micro-mesopore confinement synthetic strategy. Among them, a representative catalyst, termed FeCo-NCps, possesses highly active M-Nx-C sites, a superhigh specific surface area and a structure with abundant defects, displaying excellent bifunctional performance in both ORR and OER in 0.1 M KOH. Furthermore, a home-made rechargeable Zn-air battery was constructed using FeCo-NCps as the air cathode, delivering an excellent energy conversion efficiency (with an extremely high energy density of 922 W h kg-1 at 10 mA cm-2). This work not only provides a scalable and sustainable method to produce low-cost and highly efficient ORR/OER catalysts, but also highlights the great value of the rational design of biomass-derived nanocarbons for advanced energy materials.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
An electrochemical study on the cathode of the intermediate temperature tubular sodium-sulfur (NAS) battery,"© 2019 The Electrochemical Society.The development of low-cost energy storage schemes is imminent in light of the ever-growing demand of electricity. Sodium-sulfur (NaS) batteries offer low-cost technology for energy storage applications due to the intrinsically high capacities of elemental sodium and sulfur as well as their abundant resources. Operating this battery technology on the intermediate range (130-200◦C) can lead to lower material costs, mitigate thermal management and safety issues and enhance cycle life. Herein, an electrochemical study on the cathode of the IT NaS cell is performed at 150◦C and a concentration range of 1.5 to 3 M sodium pentasulfide dissolved in tetraglyme, showing a robust long term performance (42 days of continuous cycling) with a volumetric energy density of 83 Wh L−1. Most importantly, the cell was eligible for a tenfold volume scale-up considerably enhancing its capacity (790 mAh) but in the same time somewhat hindered by mass transport, especially during the end of the discharge process as manifested by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
Effect of eutectic accelerator in selenium-doped sulfurized polyacrylonitrile for high performance room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile is a suitable cathode candidate for room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. However, its limited reactivity results in low utilization of active materials, limited rate capability and poor cycling performance especially in ether electrolyte. Here, we demonstrate the effect of using selenium as a eutectic accelerator in sulfurized polyacrylonitrile in which a small amount of selenium is easily distributed at the molecular level and leads to significant improvement of reaction kinetics. As a result, the designed Se0.08S0.92@pPAN cathode exhibits superior rate and cycle performance as well as compatibility with both ether and carbonate electrolytes, delivers capacities of 1214 and 767 mA h g-1 at 0.1 and 3 A g-1 respectively, and maintains a good specific capacity of 770 mA h g-1 at 0.4 A g-1 over 500 cycles (0.045% decay per cycle) in carbonate electrolyte with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, self-discharge tests reveal diminished soluble sodium polysulfides owing to the fast redox conversion enabled by Se-doping.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
A S/N-doped high-capacity mesoporous carbon anode for Na-ion batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Low-cost Na-ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising alternative to Li-ion batteries (LIBs) for large-scale energy storage systems due to the abundant sodium resources and eco-friendliness. The volumetric changes of sodium anodes during the sodiation/desodiation processes, however, reduce the cycling life of Na-ion batteries. In order to solve the problem, we have used the electrospinning method to successfully fabricate mesoporous S/N-doped carbon nanofibers (S/N-C), which show a high capacity and high-rate capability in a Na-ion battery. The S/N-C nanofibers delivered a high reversible capacity of 552.5 and 355.3 mA h g-1 at 0.1 and 5 A g-1, respectively, because of the high S-doping (27.95%) in the carbon nanofibers. The introduction of N and S in S/N-C nanofibers increases the active sites for Na+ storage and reduces the energy required for Na+ transfer, as confirmed by in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, the mesoporous S/N nanofibers are wetted by liquid electrolyte, which facilitates the Na+ transport and increases the rate performance, thus making them a suitable anode material for SIBs and other electrochemical energy storage devices.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Boosting the pseudocapacitance of nitrogen-rich carbon nanorod arrays for electrochemical capacitors,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.Nitrogen-doped carbons possess the merits of carbon and the unique functionalities of N-moieties, leading to vast interest for energy storage. They are generally synthesized by the pyrolysis of N-rich polymers, which however requires relatively high temperature and causes the loss of N. The pseudocapacitive contribution from N-moieties is thus limited. Here, a low-temperature pyrolysis approach is demonstrated to prepare N-rich carbon nanorod arrays. The decomposition of (NH4)2SO4 releases ammonia and allows the incorporation of N with the oxygen functional groups in polyaniline chains. The loss of N-moieties is effectively prevented at the low-temperature condition (350 °C), resulting in a high N-content of ∼21.86%. A highly conductive 3D graphite substrate is used to further enhance the charge transfer kinetics. The optimized electrode provides an excellent gravimetric capacitance (776 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), a good rate capability and a long cycle life. The low-temperature strategy demonstrated here could also be used to fabricate other doped carbon materials with high heteroatom content. Comparing with the commonly used high-temperature pyrolysis method, this efficient low-temperature strategy provides more feasibility for large-scale applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
"Electrospun nanostructures for conversion type cathode (S, Se) based lithium and sodium batteries","© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sulfur and selenium based rechargeable batteries have attracted great attention due to their high gravimetric/volumetric energy densities owing to multielectron conversion reactions. Over the last few years, rationally designed nanomaterials have played a crucial role in the continuous growth of these battery systems. In this context, electrospun nanostructures are of paramount interest for the development of these rechargeable secondary batteries due to their high surface area to volume ratio and good mechanical stability. Here, a systematic and comprehensive review of the recent advances in the development of electrospun nanostructures as novel materials for next generation sulfur and selenium based lithium and sodium batteries is presented. In this review, we highlight the recent progress made in Li-S, RT Na-S, Li-SxSey, RT Na-SxSey, Li-Se and RT Na-Se batteries using electrospun carbon, polymers or heterostructures with tailored textural properties, compositions and surface functionalities (polysulfide trapping capability and catalytic activity) in cathodes, interlayers, separator coatings, and electrolyte membranes. The emphasis is placed on various synthesis strategies to design advanced electrospun nanostructures with tunable structural properties and the impact of these features on capacity, rate capability and long-term cycling. Moreover, we have introduced the 'fraction of (electrochemically) active cathode (FAC)' as a parameter to highlight the advantages of free-standing electrospun nanostructures compared to their non-electrospun or slurry-cast electrospun counterparts. Furthermore, current challenges and prospects in the use of electrospun nanostructures in each battery system are also discussed. We believe that this review will provide new opportunities in the field of advanced sulfur and selenium based rechargeable batteries using electrospun nanostructures.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Tin-decorated reduced graphene oxide and NaLi0.2Ni0.25Mn0.75Oδ as electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2019 by the authors.A tin-decorated reduced graphene oxide, originally developed for lithium-ion batteries, has been investigated as an anode in sodium-ion batteries. The composite has been synthetized through microwave reduction of poly acrylic acid functionalized graphene oxide and a tin oxide organic precursor. The final product morphology reveals a composite in which Sn and SnO2 nanoparticles are homogenously distributed into the reduced graphene oxide matrix. The XRD confirms the initial simultaneous presence of Sn and SnO2 particles. SnRGO electrodes, prepared using Super-P carbon as conducting additive and Pattex PL50 as aqueous binder, were investigated in a sodium metal cell. The Sn-RGO showed a high irreversible first cycle capacity: only 52% of the first cycle discharge capacity was recovered in the following charge cycle. After three cycles, a stable SEI layer was developed and the cell began to work reversibly: the practical reversible capability of the material was 170 mA·h·g-1. Subsequently, a material of formula NaLi0.2Ni0.25Mn0.75Oδ was synthesized by solid-state chemistry. It was found that the cathode showed a high degree of crystallization with hexagonal P2-structure, space group P63/mmc. The material was electrochemically characterized in sodium cell: the discharge-specific capacity increased with cycling, reaching at the end of the fifth cycle a capacity of 82 mA·h·g-1. After testing as a secondary cathode in a sodium metal cell, NaLi0.2Ni0.25Mn0.75Oδ was coupled with SnRGO anode to form a sodium-ion cell. The electrochemical characterization allowed confirmation that the battery was able to reversibly cycle sodium ions. The cell's power response was evaluated by discharging the SIB at different rates. At the lower discharge rate, the anode capacity approached the rated value (170 mA·h·g-1). By increasing the discharge current, the capacity decreased but the decline was not so pronounced: the anode discharged about 80% of the rated capacity at 1 C rate and more than 50% at 5 C rate.",Materials
Polypyrrole-encapsulated amorphous Bi2S3 hollow sphere for long life sodium ion batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as the most promising next-generation energy storage devices to displace the widely used lithium ion batteries due to their inherent advantages. Here, polypyrrole-encapsulated amorphous Bi2S3 hollow spheres are prepared by the sulfuration of Bi-glycol spheres with a polypyrrole (PPy) coating. Benefiting from the unique hollow structure (Kirkendall effect) and the excellent conductivity and flexibility of the PPy coating, this material can be applied in both SIBs and Li-S batteries. For SIBs, the unconductive amorphous Bi2S3 is electrochemically reduced to conductive metallic Bi, leading to a Bi-PPy core-shell structure. The resulting Bi acts as the main active material while the PPy coating accommodates the volume variation of Bi during sodiation/desodiation. For Li-S batteries, the outer double layer structure effectively prevents the dissolution and ""shuttle effect"" of polysulfides by physically containing and chemically adsorbing polysulfides, and tolerates the volume expansion of sulfur. Meanwhile, the residual polyvinyl pyrrolidone in the preparation process is chemically bonded with sulfur and exhibits the electrochemical properties, and results in additional discharging/charging capacity. Thus, this multifunctional electrode shows excellent rate capability and cycling life in SIBs and Li-S batteries. This work provides new insight into the design of multifunctional electrodes.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

Sodium Titanate for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2019, Allerton Press, Inc.First research related to the intercalation of sodium atoms into the structure of the host material emerged in the early 1980s. Since that time, the development of sodium-ion batteries continues. In the last decade, a considerable attention is aimed at sodium-ion batteries with the context of renewable energy sources. The consumption of non-renewable resources like oil or coal resulted in an increasing problem related to the production of greenhouse gases. The main solution to this problem is the generation of energy by renewable energy sources like wind, sun, or hydropower. Solar and wind energies are among non-dispatchable energy sources, i.e. the energy cannot be dispatched at a request of the power grid or the plant owner according to current needs. Renewable energy sources need energy storage devices for energy accumulation. Batteries play a crucial role in that application. Sodium-ion batteries present a promising solution that can deliver low-cost, environmentally friendly energy storage for sustainable development of the human society.

Homogeneous guiding deposition of sodium through main group II metals toward dendrite-free sodium anodes,"© 2019 The Authors, Some Rights Reserved.Metallic sodium is a potential anode material for rechargeable sodium-based batteries because of its high specific capacity and low cost. However, sodium commonly suffers from severe sodium dendrites and infinitely huge volume change, hampering its practical applications. Here, we demonstrate that sodium can be controllably deposited through main group II metals such as Be, Mg, and Ba since they have definite solubility in sodium and thus enable a marked reduction of the nucleation barriers of sodium, guiding the parallel growth of sodium on the metal substrates. By further homogeneously dispersing Mg clusters in a three-dimensional hierarchical structure on the basis of a carbonized Mg-based metal-organic framework-74 membrane, the nucleation barriers of sodium can be eliminated, owing to the plentiful Mg nucleation seeds. Hence, a dendrite-free sodium metal anode with a very low overpotential of 27 mV and a superior cycling stability of up to 1350 hours is achieved.",Science Advances
Strongly coupled polypyrrole/molybdenum oxide hybrid films via electrochemical layer-by-layer assembly for pseudocapacitors,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.There is an ever increasing demand for advanced electrode materials with well-defined micro-nanostructures for supercapacitors. Both polypyrrole (PPy) and molybdenum oxide (MoOx) are promising candidates for capacitive applications, yet each has limitations. Here, a facile electrochemical method capable of assembling strongly coupled layer-by-layer (LbL) PPy/MoOx hybrid films on a 3D exfoliated graphite current collector is demonstrated. The strong interlayer interaction between PPy and MoOx was studied. The spectroscopy results indicate that the protonation level of PPy is enhanced and the valence state of Mo in MoOx is reduced, which synergistically improve the charge transfer kinetics of the composites. LbL-PPy/MoOx achieves a high specific capacitance of 398 F g−1 and good cycling stability. The quantitative calculation suggests that the strong coupling effect contributes more than 50% of the total capacitance at a fast discharge rate (e.g., 20 A g−1). A 2.2 V asymmetric capacitor using LbL-PPy/MoOx as the anode can deliver a high energy density of 72.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 343 W kg−1. Our findings disclose the interfacial interaction between PPy and MoOx in the composite materials and could open up new opportunities for the fabrication of other composite materials with enhanced interactions, leading to great development in a plethora of applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
CHAPTER 8: From lithium to sodium and potassium batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-ion batteries have the highest volumetric and gravimetric energy densities among the available rechargeable batteries, hence they are the prime choice of power source in numerous portable devices. It is expected that there will be tremendous growth in electric vehicles and electrical energy storage in the future. Employing Li-ion batteries on a large scale may strain the lithium supply due to geopolitical constraints and the lower abundance of lithium resources in the Earth's crust.

A stable polypyridinopyridine-red phosphorus composite as a superior anode material for long-cycle lifetime lithium-ion batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.Red phosphorus (RP) is an attractive anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to its relatively low-cost and non-toxic nature. Here, we synthesize a novel polypyridinopyridine-red phosphorus (PPyPy-RP) composite containing phosphorus-carbon (P-C) and phosphorus-oxygen-carbon (P-O-C) bonds by a simple one-step vaporization-condensation-conversion method. The resultant PPyPy-RP composite has been investigated further as an anode material for LIBs, which exhibits a high discharge specific capacity of 1870.2 mA h gphosphorus−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles. In the meantime, a stable discharge specific capacity of 518.3 mA h gphosphorus−1 within 2000 cycles is maintained at a higher current density of 5000 mA g−1. This superior performance is attributed to the structural stability of the chemically bonded PPyPy-RP composite, which plays an important role in maintaining contact between the P and conductive polypyridinopyridine (PPyPy) during the electrochemical process.",New Journal of Chemistry

Sodium Metal Anodes: Emerging Solutions to Dendrite Growth,"Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society. This comprehensive Review focuses on the key challenges and recent progress regarding sodium-metal anodes employed in sodium-metal batteries (SMBs). The metal anode is the essential component of emerging energy storage systems such as sodium sulfur and sodium selenium, which are discussed as example full-cell applications. We begin with a description of the differences in the chemical and physical properties of Na metal versus the oft-studied Li metal, and a corresponding discussion regarding the number of ways in which Na does not follow Li-inherited paradigms in its electrochemical behavior. We detail the major challenges for Na-metal systems that at this time limit the feasibility of SMBs. The core Na anode problems are the following interrelated degradation mechanisms: An unstable solid electrolyte interphase with most organic electrolytes, ""mossy"" and ""lath-like"" metal dendrite growth for liquid systems, poor Coulombic efficiency, and gas evolution. Even solid-state Na batteries are not immune, with metal dendrites being reported. The solutions may be subdivided into the following interrelated taxonomy: Improved electrolytes and electrolyte additives tailored for Na-metal anodes, interfacial engineering between the metal and the liquid or solid electrolyte, electrode architectures that both reduce the current density during plating-stripping and serve as effective hosts that shield the Na metal from excessive reactions, and alloy design to tune the bulk properties of the metal per se. For instance, stable plating-stripping of Na is extremely difficult with conventional carbonate solvents but has been reported with ethers and glymes. Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) such as beta-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE), sodium superionic conductor (NASICON), and sodium thiophosphate (75Na 2 S·25P 2 S 5 ) present highly exciting opportunities for SMBs that avoid the dangers of flammable liquids. Even SSEs are not immune to dendrites, however, which grow through the defects in the bulk pellet, but may be controlled through interfacial energy modification. We conclude with a discussion of the key research areas that we feel are the most fruitful for further pursuit. In our opinion, greatly improved understanding and control of the SEI structure is the key to cycling stability. A holistic approach involving complementary post-mortem, in situ, and operando analyses to elucidate full battery cell level structure-performance relations is advocated.",Chemical Reviews
Rechargeable aluminum batteries: effects of cations in ionic liquid electrolytes,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are solvent-free liquids comprised of densely packed cations and anions. The low vapor pressure and low flammability make ILs interesting for electrolytes in batteries. In this work, a new class of ionic liquids were formed for rechargeable aluminum/graphite battery electrolytes by mixing 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium chloride (Py13Cl) with various ratios of aluminum chloride (AlCl3) (AlCl3/Py13Cl molar ratio = 1.4 to 1.7). Fundamental properties of the ionic liquids, including density, viscosity, conductivity, anion concentrations and electrolyte ion percent were investigated and compared with the previously investigated 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (EMIC-AlCl3) ionic liquids. The results showed that the Py13Cl-AlCl3 ionic liquid exhibited lower density, higher viscosity and lower conductivity than its EMIC-AlCl3 counterpart. We devised a Raman scattering spectroscopy method probing ILs over a Si substrate, and by using the Si Raman scattering peak for normalization, we quantified speciation including AlCl4−, Al2Cl7−, and larger AlCl3 related species with the general formula (AlCl3)n in different IL electrolytes. We found that larger (AlCl3)n species existed only in the Py13Cl-AlCl3 system. We propose that the larger cationic size of Py13+ (142 Å3) versus EMI+ (118 Å3) dictated the differences in the chemical and physical properties of the two ionic liquids. Both ionic liquids were used as electrolytes for aluminum-graphite batteries, with the performances of batteries compared. The chloroaluminate anion-graphite charging capacity and cycling stability of the two batteries were similar. The Py13Cl-AlCl3 based battery showed a slightly larger overpotential than EMIC-AlCl3, leading to lower energy efficiency resulting from higher viscosity and lower conductivity. The results here provide fundamental insights into ionic liquid electrolyte design for optimal battery performance.",RSC Advances

Ab initio investigation of the stability of electrolyte/electrode interfaces in all-solid-state Na batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.All-solid-state batteries show great potential for achieving high energy density with less safety problems; however, (electro)chemical issues at the solid electrolyte/electrode interface may severely limit their performance. In this work, the electrochemical stability and chemical reactivity of a wide range of potential Na solid-state electrolyte chemistries were investigated using density functional theory calculations. In general, lower voltage limits are predicted for both the reduction and oxidation of Na compounds compared with those of their Li counterparts. The lower reduction limits for the Na compounds indicate their enhanced cathodic stability as well as the possibility of stable sodium metal cycling against a number of oxides and borohydrides. With increasing Na content (or chemical potential), improved cathodic stability but also reduced anodic stability are observed. An increase in the oxidation voltage is shown for Na polyanion systems, including borohydrides, NaSICON-type oxides, and aluminates, due to the covalent stabilization of the anions. In addition, the oxides exhibit remarkable chemical stability when in contact with various cathode materials (layered transition metal oxides and fluorophosphates), whereas the chalcogenides predictably display narrow electrochemical windows and high chemical reactivity. Our findings indicate some promising candidates for solid-state conductors and/or protective coating materials to enable the operation of high-energy-density all-solid-state Na batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Untying thioether bond structures enabled by “voltage-scissors” for stable room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.A steady sulfur cathode is central to realizing stable room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries. Here, sulfur atoms are incorporated into carbon to form thioether bond functionalized carbon (SC) as a cathode material for sodium storage, which is capable of the complete elimination or great suppression of the shuttle effect of soluble poly-sulfides by the generation of insoluble sulfides in RT Na-S batteries using an ordinary carbonate electrolyte. This thioether bond structure (C-S-C) in sulfur-doped carbon can be disassembled by the assistance of “voltage-scissors” in the low voltage range of 0.01-0.50 V vs. Na/Na+. The small sulfur species derived from the thioether bond structure react with the sodium anode to form insoluble sulfides. Moreover, the insoluble sulfides Na2S2 and Na2S are confined in the carbon defects induced by the cleaved sulfur to prevent them from degrading the long-chain poly-sulfides. The distinctive electrochemical performance of SC enriches our understanding of the sulfur cathode, and could provide novel insights for constructing stable sulfur cathode materials for specific energy storage devices.",Nanoscale
Sodium-based batteries: from critical materials to battery systems,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sodium-based energy storage systems are attracting tremendous attention along with the growing demand for electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage. Sharing similar intercalation chemistry to their lithium counterpart, sodium-ion based systems show promising potential for large-scale application due to the benefit of the low cost and natural abundance of sodium sources. However, despite the rapid progress, sodium-based energy storage systems still face enormous challenges such as slow kinetics and unstable cyclability, which continue to attract intense research efforts.

Furthermore, to highlight the recent progress, we discuss the design and optimization of Na-O2 (CO2) batteries through an evaluation of the electrolytes and cathode configuration with suitable gas channels, which are critical factors to determine the reaction mechanism. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of sodium-based energy systems are also presented.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

Here, a novel composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) with nano-SiO2 acting as a cross-linking agent to form a 3D cross-linked network was synthesized to improve the electrochemical stability and mechanical ability. The novel CPE exhibited some excellent properties such as high ionic conductivity (4.65 × 10-3 S cm-1 at room temperature) with a broad electrochemical stability window (∼5.4 V vs. Li/Li+), high ionic transfer number (0.45), high mechanical robustness and flexibility (Young's module ∼8.9 MPa, breaking strain 181%), and excellent interface stability. The lithium metal battery LiFePO4/CPE/Li was assembled and delivered a specific capacity of 160 mA h g-1 with a capacity retention of above 90% after 500 cycles at 1C.

The cathode demonstrated excellent cycling stability and rate capability by delivering a reversible specific capacity of 419mAh g−1 at 8C after 500 cycles with low capacity fading at 0.04% per cycle. At high sulfur loading of 4.7mg cm−2 the batteries delivered 3.4mAh cm−2 areal capacity after 100 cycles at 0.5C. The synergistic effect of strong chemical interaction between lithium polysulfides and WS2, and the superior electronic conductivity of carbon nanosheets are responsible for the enhanced performance. It also suppressed the self-discharge phenomenon by maintaining 94.5% of its initial capacity after 10 days resting. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis demonstrated that even after 400 cycles, the interfacial and charge transfer resistances only increased by 1.2 and 1.7, respectively, describing faster electrochemical kinetics by inhibiting the formation of insulating layer of lithium sulfide (Li2S) on the surface of the electrodes.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
Cellular carbon-wrapped FeSe 2 nanocavities with ultrathin walls and multiple rooms for ion diffusion-confined ultrafast sodium storage,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with high energy/power density have been in urgent demand for various power applications. Upgrading the electrochemical dynamics of electrode materials is crucial to achieve this goal. Herein, we exhibit delicately synthesized cellular carbon-wrapped FeSe 2 nanocavities (h-FeSe 2 @PC) with sub-5 nm ultrathin walls and multiple rooms for ultrafast sodium storage. Unlike with the conventional interphase Kirkendall effect, the multi-room FeSe 2 nanocavities were formed via an exotic stress-induced cracking-hollowing reassembly mechanism. Benefiting from their unique multi-hierarchy, more than 93% pseudocapacitive capacity contribution was recognized in an h-FeSe 2 @PC anode, featuring ultrafast dynamics. As a result, h-FeSe 2 @PC displayed an extremely low-decay (9.5%) rate capability, ultrastable cyclability (over 2000 loops with 98.5% capacity retention), and high energy/power densities (670.7 W h kg -1 /35.3 kW kg -1 at 20 A g -1 ). The results of multiple analyses and comparisons showed that the dynamics-promoted superior performance was correlated almost completely to the applied FeSe 2 in h-FeSe 2 @PC by shortening the Na + -diffusion length to near the accessible limit (<10 nm) and to the fast electron transfer ensured by the cellular carbon. The exhibited dynamics-oriented materials design could open up an avenue to aid the further development of high-performance electrodes.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
"High and intermediate temperature sodium-sulfur batteries for energy storage: development, challenges and perspectives","© The Royal Society of Chemistry. In view of the burgeoning demand for energy storage stemming largely from the growing renewable energy sector, the prospects of high (>300 °C), intermediate (100-200 °C) and room temperature (25-60 °C) battery systems are encouraging. Metal sulfur batteries are an attractive choice since the sulfur cathode is abundant and offers an extremely high theoretical capacity of 1672 mA h g −1 upon complete discharge. Sodium also has high natural abundance and a respectable electrochemical reduction potential (−2.71 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). Combining these two abundant elements as raw materials in an energy storage context leads to the sodium-sulfur battery (NaS). This review focuses solely on the progress, prospects and challenges of the high and intermediate temperature NaS secondary batteries (HT and IT NaS) as a whole. The already established HT NaS can be further improved in terms of energy density and safety record. The IT NaS takes advantage of the lower operating temperature to lower manufacturing and potentially operating costs whilst creating a safer environment. A thorough technical discussion on the building blocks of these two battery systems is discussed here, including electrolyte, separators, cell configuration, electrochemical reactions that take place under the different operating conditions and ways to monitor and comprehend the physicochemical and electrochemical processes under these temperatures. Furthermore, a brief summary of the work conducted on the room temperature (RT) NaS system is given seeking to couple the knowledge in this field with the one at elevated temperatures. Finally, future perspectives are discussed along with ways to effectively handle the technical challenges presented for this electrochemical energy storage system.",RSC Advances
The combination of intercalation and conversion reactions to improve the volumetric capacity of the cathode in Li-S batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Lithium-sulfur batteries are currently attracting wide interest due to their high theoretical capacity, although their energy density is greatly limited by the low tap density of traditional C/S cathode materials. Herein hollow VO 2 @S microspheres were designed as cathode materials with high volumetric capacity by combining the intercalation and conversion mechanisms. The hollow microsphere can offer enough space for high sulfur loading, which results in a high tap density of 1.64 g cm -3 , while VO 2 can offer additional capacity by Li intercalation reactions and has strong interactions with polysulfides to prevent the shuttling effect by its in situ surface sulfidation. Therefore, the obtained materials delivered a high volumetric capacity (1084 mA h cm -3 at 0.1C) and good rate capability and cycling performance (440 mA h g -1 at 1.0C after 200 cycles). This study demonstrates that traditional cathode materials with a proper potential window would be an alternative host for sulfur to offer additional capacity and increase the energy density due to their high tap density.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Discarded cigarette filter-derived hierarchically porous carbon@graphene composites for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Discarded cigarette filters mainly composed of cellulose acetate (CA) are non-biodegradable and can cause a severe environmental pollution hazard. In an effort to turn waste into wealth, herein, we explore hierarchically porous carbon@graphene composites derived from cigarette filters as efficient cathode hosts for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The hierarchical porous structure enables high sulfur loading and confines the dissolution of lithium polysulfides while the strongly coupled graphene provides an electrically conductive network for electrons to transfer within the composites. Accordingly, the cigarette filter-derived porous carbon@graphene-based cathode containing 78 wt% sulfur could achieve a high capacity of 1010 mA h g -1 at 0.2C after 200 cycles and even 722 mA h g -1 at 0.5C over 1000 cycles with only ∼0.04% capacity loss per cycle. The findings may open a new trash-to-treasure avenue for the development of high-performance electrode materials in energy storage devices.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Metal-organic frameworks for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have gained popularity over recent decades due to their theoretically superior performance, which renders them a promising new energy storage technology. To cater to the increasing demand for energy, suitable and effective materials are desired to constitute Li-S batteries, especially as host materials, separators and interlayers. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), novel porous materials, have attracted public attention because of their controllable porous structure and ultrahigh porosity. Moreover, MOF composites and MOF derivatives exhibit even better performance and reduce the shortcomings of pure MOFs. These MOF-based materials are confirmed to be perfect candidates for several important parts in Li-S batteries. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive introduction to the excellent performance of pristine MOFs, MOF composites and MOF derivatives in Li-S batteries as host materials, separators or interlayers, including their working mechanism as different constituents. An outlook of possible research directions in the near future and difficulties in development is also given.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
In situ extracted poly(acrylic acid) contributing to electrospun nanofiber separators with precisely tuned pore structures for ultra-stable lithium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are extremely attractive for next-generation energy storage technologies owing to their high energy density, low cost and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, the severe shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPS) has been one of the major technical challenges causing the rapid capacity fading of Li-S batteries. Herein, we prepare a uniquely designed polyacrylonitrile/poly(acrylic acid) composite nanofiber separator with controllable pore structures and abundant electronegative groups, which is denoted as E-PAN/PAA, to effectively suppress the shuttling effect of LiPS. By a facile electrospinning strategy combined with ethanol steaming treatment, poly(acrylic acid) can be in situ extracted out from the inside of PAN/PAA composite nanofibers to precisely tune the pore structure of the nanofiber separator. As a result, the optimized E-PAN/PAA separator can act as an ionic sieve to allow fast Li + transport while effectively inhibiting LiPS migration as well, leading to a high initial capacity of 1232 mA h g −1 at 0.1C and a remarkable cycling stability with an ultra-low fading rate of 0.03% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1C. Moreover, the E-PAN/PAA separator presents a remarkable combination of excellent electrolyte wettability, thermal stability and mechanical properties, providing a valuable strategy for the design and manufacture of advanced Li-S battery separators.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

This unusual cathode combines the sulfur host and the current collector together, increasing the sulfur mass ratio by over 20% compared with routine cathodes, resulting in excellent cycling performance with an initial capacity of 1325 mA h g-1 and a coulombic efficiency of over 99% at 1.0C.",Chemical Communications
High-performance lithium-organic batteries by achieving 16 lithium storage in poly(imine-anthraquinone),"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Organic materials have attracted intensive research interest in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) due to their advantages of structural diversity, low cost and sustainability in nature. Here we report a highly conjugated organic framework, poly(imine-anthraquinone) (PIAQ), as the anode material of LIBs. It was synthesized by a green and environmentally friendly in situ solvothermal condensation reaction. When applied in LIBs, the PIAQ exhibits an outstanding reversible specific capacity (1231 mA h g -1 at 200 mA g -1 ), excellent long-term cycle stability (486 mA h g -1 , 1000 cycles at 1 A g -1 ), and good rate performance. As further revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Li storage mechanism of PIAQ is a reversible process associated with a six-step insertion/deintercalation of 16 Li + per molecule, which is well consistent with the experimental results. Both the structural stability and excellent performance of PIAQ make it one of the most promising organic electrode materials for next-generation LIBs.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Rechargeable Na/Ni batteries based on the Ni(OH) 2 /NiOOH redox couple with high energy density and good cycling performance,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Rechargeable battery systems that use Na-based anodes as alternatives to Li-ion batteries are highly desirable for grid-scale energy storage systems owing to the high abundance and low cost of Na. Furthermore, aqueous Na batteries are advantageous considering the cost, safety and cycle life. However, the limited energy density is still a critical issue for Na-based batteries. Here, we demonstrate a high performance rechargeable battery using dual electrolytes based on a Na metal anode and a redox couple of hierarchical NiCoAl-layered double hydroxide (NiCoAl-LDH) nanosheets on a carbon microfiber electrode with high energy storage capacity. In this design, the wide potential range of the Na metal anode and the high capacity of hierarchical NiCoAl-LDH nanosheets on a carbon microfiber cathode enable a rechargeable Na/Ni battery with excellent energy storage performance. For stable operation in a hybrid system using non-aqueous and aqueous electrolytes, an alkali-ion solid electrolyte (NASICON, Na 3 Zr 2 Si 2 PO 12 ) is used for the separation of electrolytes. The Na/Ni battery exhibits a stable operating voltage of ∼3.1 V during discharge which outperforms the low cell voltage (∼1.23 V) of an aqueous rechargeable battery, a high capacity of ∼350 mA h g -1 , and a resulting high energy density of ∼1085 W h kg -1 . With the combination of a solid-state redox couple as the cathode and a metallic sodium anode, our study demonstrates the high potential of Na based batteries for high energy EES systems.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Adapting FeS 2 micron particles as an electrode material for lithium-ion batteries: Via simultaneous construction of CNT internal networks and external cages,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Volume changes, polysulfide shuttle effects, and low Li-ion/electronic conductivity of sulfide electrodes limit their application in Li-ion batteries with high-energy density. Here, micron FeS 2 particles with bifunctional carbon nanotubes (FeS 2 @B-CNTs) including CNT internal conductive networks and external protective cages were prepared by a one-step solvothermal method. The internal CNTs anchor FeS 2 via chemical binding, which much more effectively inhibited the shuttle effect than physical confinement alone. Meanwhile, reticular CNT cages were generated on the surface of the composite FeS 2 micron particles, buffering volumetric changes during cycling and further restraining the shuttle of polysulfides. Additionally, a three-dimensional CNT framework offered a primarily continuous charge transfer pathway. The FeS 2 @B-CNTs electrode had a high initial coulombic efficiency of 91.3% and delivered a capacity of 698 mA h g -1 over 500 cycles at 1000 mA g -1 . The Li-ion diffusion coefficient is two orders of magnitude higher than those of previous reports, which improved the rate performance of the FeS 2 @B-CNTs electrode. These studies on micron FeS 2 spheres shed light on the design strategies for the application of sulfide electrodes.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Crystallized lithium titanate nanosheets prepared: Via spark plasma sintering for ultra-high rate lithium ion batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry. This paper shows that a lithium titanate (LTO) nanosheet material is successfully prepared by the spark plasma sintering (SPS) method at 500 °C within only 5 minutes, using its nanosheet precursor synthesized by hydrothermal reaction. The pulsed electric field induces the phase transition of the precursor at much lower temperature and in a much shorter time during the SPS process. Moreover, the thin layer morphology of the LTO precursor can be well maintained after SPS treatment, which has been changed into nanoparticles during the conventional solid state calcination. The crystalline LTO nanosheets prepared by SPS deliver high specific capacities of 151.2 mA h g -1 and 147.2 mA h g -1 at high current densities of 8 A g -1 (45.7C) and 10 A g -1 (57.1C), respectively. Moreover, the LTO nanosheets display stable capacity retentions of 73.9% and 75.6% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g -1 and 2 A g -1 , respectively.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
A railway-like network electrode design for room temperature Na-S battery,"© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Poor conductivity and severe volume expansion of sulfur (S) electrode are the key issues for the practical application of room temperature Na-S battery. In this paper, we propose a 3D railway-like electrode design to tackle these problems for room temperature Na-S battery. Nitrogen-doped porous carbon polyhedrons (NPCs) as ""station"" for loading S are tightly concatenated by 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as ""railway"" for transporting electrons to form a 3D railway-like network (CNT/NPC) as S host. The 3D cross-linked railway-like network not only facilitates the rapid transfer of electrons for high capacity but also connects the polyhedrons during the cycling maintaining the integrity of the electrode. With this rational design, 3D railway-like S@CNT/NPC electrode shows a high discharge capacity of ∼601 mA h g -1 at 0.5C and outstanding rate capability. In addition, a high capacity of 410 mA h g -1 can still be achieved after 500 cycles with a very low capacity decay rate of 0.064% per cycle.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Fluoroethylene carbonate as an additive in a carbonates-based electrolyte for enhancing the specific capacity of room-temperature sodium-sulfur cell,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Room-temperature sodium‑sulfur (RT Na-S) battery is a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage applications due to its high theoretical specific energy, low cost, and environmental benefits. Here the effect of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as an additive in 1.0 M NaClO4-ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate (EC/PC, V/V = 1/1) electrolyte was verified in RT Na-S battery with a high-surface-area carbon/sulfur composite (YP50F/S) as the cathode. Using 1.0 M NaClO4-EC/PC electrolyte containing 5 wt% FEC, the YP50F/S electrode can deliver a reversible capacity of up to 1651 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. When 5 wt% FEC-added electrolyte is used, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the electrode surface clearly indicates a more effective solid electrolyte interface (SEI), a more thorough transformation between S and Na2S, and a more obvious redox reaction between sulfur oxides during the first discharge-charge processes. We further confirm that 5 wt% FEC can also be employed for another activated carbon material (XFP01), therefore, our work may provide a new insight for the development of RT Na-S battery.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry
Impact of the electrolyte salt anion on the solid electrolyte interphase formation in sodium ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdAiming at a more comprehensive understanding of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in sodium ion batteries (NIBs), a detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigation of the few-nanometer thick passivation film formed on hard carbon (HC) in contact with various Na+-ion conducting electrolytes is reported. The electrolytes investigated include 1 M solutions of NaPF6, NaClO4, NaTFSI, NaFSI, and NaFTFSI, all dissolved in a common mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethylene carbonate (DEC) (EC/DEC = 1/1 wt. ratio). For comparison, the study of analogous Li-based electrolytes containing LiPF6 and LiFSI as representative electrolyte salts is also reported. The anion and cation of the electrolyte salt appear to play a key role in determining the overall SEI layer composition, including its depth evolution and thickness. The SEI building species formed on hard carbon by solvent reduction upon sodiation are found to decrease with the various salts in the order: NaPF6 > NaClO4 ≈ NaTFSI > NaFTFSI > NaFSI. The comparison of lithiated and sodiated HC electrodes shows that the SEI layer is more homogeneous and richer in organic species upon the use of Na-based electrolytes. Surface and depth-profiling XPS analysis on HC electrodes charged in the various electrolyte formulations provides in-depth insights on the differences and similarities of the SEI (composition, thickness, depth evolution, etc.) evolving from the variation in the chemical structure of the cations and anions of the respective salts.",Nano Energy
"A theoretical study on the stability and ionic conductivity of the Na11M2PS12 (M = Sn, Ge) superionic conductors","© 2018 Elsevier B.V.The search for next-generation solid-state superionic conductors has attracted significant attention. Among Na superionic conductors, Na11Sn2PS12 has been reported to have a room temperature ionic conductivity of 1.4 mS/cm. In this study, we employ density functional theory to study the stability of Na11Sn2PS12 and further explore the substitution of Sn with Ge. Our results indicate that Na11Ge2PS12 is more stable than Na11Sn2PS12. Furthermore, substituting Sn with Ge increases the band gap, improves the room temperature ionic conductivity by a factor of 2, and lowers the activation energy of Na hopping. Statistical analysis suggests that Na11Ge2PS12 has a faster diffusion along the ab-plane compared to the c-axis. The Na diffusion in Na11Ge2PS12 appears to occur with two different mechanisms depending on temperature: 1) an ion hopping process at lower temperatures (<800 K); 2) a fluid-like distribution of Na ions at higher temperatures (>1000 K). The computations suggest that Na11Ge2PS12 is a promising candidate as a solid Na electrolyte due to its high room temperature ionic conductivity and phase stability. In light of these simulation results, we expect to stimulate further experimental studies on Na11Ge2PS12.",Journal of Power Sources

Uncovering the Cu-driven electrochemical mechanism of transition metal chalcogenides based electrodes,"© 2018Transition-metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have emerged as attractive anode materials for rechargeable batteries due to their excellent performance and abundant resources. Here, for the first time, we disclose a unique copper (Cu)-driven conversion process in TMC-based battery systems that involves classic Cu current collector and is considered to be an “activation process”. According to state-of-the-art characterization techniques, Cu was evidenced to gradually replace the transition-metal elements in TMCs to be the active material during cycling. Based on this unique Cu-driven conversion mechanism, we used a facile method to design a new type of sulfur-based battery that presents excellent performance: a reversible capacity of 1.045 mAh cm−2 after 700 cycles at 2 A g−1, and a good rate capability up to a capacity of 0.33 mAh cm−2 at 20 A g−1.

"Sodium metal anodes for room-temperature sodium-ion batteries: Applications, challenges and solutions","© 2018Room-temperature (RT) sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have gained much attention due to rich sodium resource and low cost for potential application in large-scale energy storage. To date, cathode materials have been well investigated, but anode materials still face long-standing challenges including low capacity and high cost, which have led to comprehensive research efforts in resolving these issues. Among the many candidate anode materials best suited to meet these challenges, Na metal possesses the most future potential: the lowest redox potential, highest theoretical capacity, earth-abundancy and a demonstrated feasibility in previous electrochemical systems. Yet several factors still hinder the applicability of Na metal anodes in future larger scale, such as unstable solid electrolyte interphase, large volume change upon cycling and safety concerns related to the uncontrolled dendritic Na growth. As such, this review summarizes the applications of Na metal anodes before providing an in-depth review of research efforts attempting to solve the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, recently-developed strategies to protect Na metal anodes by electrolyte optimization, artificial solid electrolyte interphase, and electrode structure design are outlined and analyzed in detail.

Rechargeable potassium-ion batteries enabled by potassium-iodine conversion chemistry,"© 2018Potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) have emerged as attractive alternatives to dominative lithium-ion batteries for grid-level electricity storage due to lower potential of K+/K redox couple in non-aqueous electrolyte and abundant potassium resource.

We for the first time demonstrate a rechargeable potassium-iodine (K-I2) battery enabled by a two-electron K-I2 conversion reaction. With the help of in-situ Raman and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we confirm that the highly reversible conversion among I2, KI3 and KI involves solid-liquid-solid phase transitions and the formation of soluble KI3 intermediate enables the fast reaction kinetics. The K-I2 battery delivers a reversible capacity of 156 mA h/g and a small capacity decay of 0.058% per cycle over 500 cycles.",Energy Storage Materials
Construction of Soft Base Tongs on Separator to Grasp Polysulfides from Shuttling in Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRechargeable lithium–sulfur batteries, which use sulfur as the cathode material, promise great potentials to be the next-generation high-energy system. However, higher-order lithium polysulfides, Li2Sx (x = 4, 6, and 8), regardless of in charge or in discharge, always form first, dissolve subsequently in the electrolyte, and shuttle to the cathode and the anode, which is called “shuttle effect.” The polysulfides shuttle effect leads to heavy loss of the active-sulfur materials. Literature works mostly “cover or fill” the pores to block polysulfides from shuttling, which also hinder the lithium ion transfer. Here a protocol is invented to grasp polysulfides based on the “soft and hard acid–base” theory. Tertiary amine layer (TAL) polymerized on a polypropylene separator selectively coordinates with the dissolved high-order Li2Sx in the cathode. Meanwhile, the transportation of lithium cations is not interrupted because of enough pores left for their transportation. After 400 cycles of charge/discharge at 0.5C, the TAL modified separator battery still possesses a capacity of 865 mAh g−1, which is among the best of the state-of-the-art performances of lithium–sulfur batteries. The flexible “polysulfides tongs” construction method paves a new way for Li–S batteries to reach desired performances with less worry about polysulfides shuttle.",Small
High-Rate Nanostructured Pyrite Cathodes Enabled by Fluorinated Surface and Compact Grain Stacking via Sulfuration of Ionic Liquid Coated Fluorides,"Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society. Metal-polysulfide batteries are attracting broad attention as conversion reaction systems of high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, their further applications are hindered by the low loading of active species, excess conductive additive, and loose (nanostructured) electrode networkss. Herein, we propose that compact grain stacking and surface fluorination are two crucial factors for achieving high-rate and long-life pyrite (FeS 2 ) cathodes enabled by sulfurating ionic liquid wrapped open-framework fluorides. Both of the factors can accelerate the Li- and Na-driven transport across the pyrite-electrolyte interface and conversion propagation between adjacent grains. Such an electrode design enables a highly reversible capacity of 425 mAh/g after 1000 cycles at 1 C for Li storage and 450 mAh/g after 1200 cycles at 2 C for Na storage, even under a high loading of pyrite grains and ultrathin carbon coating (<2 nm). Its cathode energy density can reach to 800 and 350 Wh/kg for Li and Na cells, respectively, under a high power density of 10000 W/kg. The cross-linkage between ionic liquid and fluoride precursors appears to be a solution to the reinforcement of surface fluorination.",ACS Nano
Directional Flow-Aided Sonochemistry Yields Graphene with Tunable Defects to Provide Fundamental Insight on Sodium Metal Plating Behavior,"Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society. We report a directional flow-aided sonochemistry exfoliation technique that allows for unparalleled control of graphene structural order and chemical uniformity. Depending on the orientation of the shockwave relative to the flow-aligned graphite flakes, the resultant bilayer and trilayer graphene is nearly defect free (at-edge sonication graphene ""AES-G"") or is highly defective (in-plane sonication graphene ""IPS-G""). AES-G has a Raman G/D band intensity ratio of 14.3 and an XPS-derived O content of 1.3 at. %, while IPS-G has an I G/D of 1.6 and 6.2 at. % O. AES-G and IPS-G are then employed to understand the role of carbon support structure and chemistry in Na metal plating/stripping for sodium metal battery anodes. The presence of graphene defects and oxygen groups is highly deleterious: In a standard carbonate solution (1 M NaClO 4 , 1:1 EC-DEC, 5 vol % FEC), AES-G gives stable cycling at 2 mA/cm 2 with 100% Coulombic efficiency (CE) (within instrument accuracy) and an area capacity of 1 mAh/cm 2 . Meanwhile IPS-G performs on-par with the baseline Cu support in terms of poor CE, severe mossy metal dendrites, and periodic electrical shorts. We argue that solid electrolyte interface (SEI) stability is the key for stable cycling, with defects of IPS-G being catalytic toward SEI formation. For IPS-G, the SEI layer also shows F-rich ""hot spots"" due to accelerated decomposition of FEC additive in localized regions.",ACS Nano

Fluorinated solid electrolyte interphase enables highly reversible solid-state Li metal battery,"Copyright © 2018 The Authors.Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are receiving great interest because their high mechanical strength and transference number could potentially suppress Li dendrites and their high electrochemical stability allows the use of high-voltage cathodes, which enhances the energy density and safety of batteries. However, the much lower critical current density and easier Li dendrite propagation in SSEs than in nonaqueous liquid electrolytes hindered their possible applications. Herein, we successfully suppressed Li dendrite growth in SSEs by in situ forming an LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) between the SSEs and the Li metal. The LiF-rich SEI successfully suppresses the penetration of Li dendrites into SSEs, while the low electronic conductivity and the intrinsic electrochemical stability of LiF block side reactions between the SSEs and Li. The LiF-rich SEI enhances the room temperature critical current density of Li3PS4 to a record-high value of >2 mA cm−2. Moreover, the Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency was escalated from 88% of pristine Li3PS4 to more than 98% for LiF-coated Li3PS4. In situ formation of electronic insulating LiF-rich SEI provides an effective way to prevent Li dendrites in the SSEs, constituting a substantial leap toward the practical applications of next-generation high-energy solid-state Li metal batteries.",Science Advances
Chemical Synthesis of K 2 S 2 and K 2 S 3 for Probing Electrochemical Mechanisms in K-S Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society. Understanding the properties of polysulfide intermediates is crucial for explaining and optimizing metal-sulfur batteries. Unlike the unstable or inseparable low-order polysulfide intermediates in Li-S systems, the K-S phase diagram displays a series of stable phases of K 2 S n (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), which provides the accessibility of an individual polysulfide to investigate the mechanism using pure-phase polysulfides. Herein, we synthesized two key intermediate polysulfides, K 2 S 2 and K 2 S 3 , and probed their electrochemical pathways. When K 2 S 2 and K 2 S 3 are coated directly on a current collector, both species can be further reduced. However, when K 2 S 2 and K 2 S 3 are electrically isolated from the current collector, no further reduction is observed, showing the reduction occurs through a solid-state conversion pathway. Interestingly, K 2 S 2 and K 2 S 3 can be charged even when they are electrically isolated from the current collector, proving solution-mediated charging pathways. Only K 2 S is the ""dead"" sulfur species that cannot be charged.",ACS Energy Letters
Recognizing the Mechanism of Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Cathode Materials for Li-S Batteries and beyond in Al-S Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is the most promising cathode for next-generation lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries due to the much improved stability. However, the molecular structure and reaction mechanism have not yet been fully understood. Herein, we present a new take on the structure and mechanism to interpret the electrochemical behaviors. We find that the thiyl radical is generated after the cleavage of the S-S bond in molecules in the first cycle, and then a conjugative structure can be formed due to electron delocalization of the thiyl radical on the pyridine backbone. The conjugative structure can react with lithium ions through a lithium coupled electron transfer process and form an ion-coordination bond reversibly. This could be the real reason for the superior lithium storage capability, in which the lithium polysulfide may not be formed. This study refreshes current knowledge of SPAN in Li-S batteries. In addition, the structural analysis is applicable to analyze the current organic cathodes in rechargeable batteries and also allows further applications in Al-S batteries to achieve high performance.",ACS Energy Letters
Electrolytes for Batteries with Earth-Abundant Metal Anodes,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimEarth-abundant metal anodes have become one of the hottest topics in recent years.

CNT Interwoven Nitrogen and Oxygen Dual-Doped Porous Carbon Nanosheets as Free-Standing Electrodes for High-Performance Na-Se and K-Se Flexible Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimNa-Se and K-Se batteries are attractive as a stationary energy storage system because of much abundant resources of Na and K in the Earth's crust. As the alloy-type Se has a severe pulverization issue, one critical challenge to develop advanced Na-Se and K-Se batteries is to explore a highly efficient and stable Se-based cathode. Herein, a flexible free-standing Se/carbon composite film is prepared by encapsulation of Se into a carbon nanotube (CNT) interwoven N,O dual-doped porous carbon nanosheet (Se@NOPC-CNT). The 3D interconnected CNT uniformly wrapped on the N,O dual-doped porous carbon skeletons improves the flexibility and offers an interconnected conductive pathway for rapid ionic/electronic transport. In addition, the N,O dual-doping significantly enhances the chemical affinity and adhesion between NaxSe/KxSe (0 < x ≤ 2) and porous carbon, which is confirmed by density functional theory calculation. When used as the cathode in Na-Se batteries, the Se@NOPC-CNT delivers a remarkable reversible capacity of 400 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 2000 cycles with a 0.008% capacity decay per cycle. For K-Se batteries, it also exhibits an excellent cycling stability (335 mA h g−1 after 700 cycles at 0.8 A g−1). This unique design may open an avenue for practical application of flexible Na-Se and K-Se batteries.",Advanced Materials
Constructing Universal Ionic Sieves via Alignment of Two-Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs),"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe shuttle effect of electrode materials always leads to capacity loss and poor cycle life of batteries. Two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with uniform and controllable nanopores provide a promising strategy for fabricating ionic sieves to inhibit the shuttle effect. However, the insoluble nature of COFs made it difficult to fabricate compact and ordered membranes of COFs. Herein, we report a novel method for facilely anisotropic ordering of 2D COFs via depositing COFs onto graphene. The resulted double-layer membranes acting as ionic sieves impressively inhibit the shuttle effect and exhibit versatility to both organic sodium-ion batteries and Li-S batteries, leading to high cyclability.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Recent Progress in Liquid Electrolyte-Based Li–S Batteries: Shuttle Problem and Solutions,"© 2018, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University.Abstract: Lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs) are among the most promising candidates for next-generation high-energy lithium batteries. However, the polysulfide shuttle effect remains a key obstacle in the practical application of LSBs. Liquid electrolytes, which transport lithium ions between electrodes, play a vital role in battery performances due to the dissolution of polysulfides, and recently, researchers have shown that LSB performances can be greatly improved through the confinement of polysulfides within cathodes. Inspired by this, growing efforts are been devoted to the suppression of the shuttle effect in LSBs by using liquid electrolytes, such as controlling the solubility of solvents and intercepting shuttle reactions. In this review, the design of applicable electrolytes and their functionality on the shuttle effect will be outlined and discussed. In addition, perspectives regarding the future research of LSBs will be presented. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Electrochemical Energy Reviews
Sodium storage performance and mechanism of rGO-wrapped nanorod vanadium sulfide as an anode material for sodium ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Nanorod vanadium sulfide wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite is synthesized by a facile solvothermal reaction. Nanorod vanadium sulfide is uniformly distributed on the surface of rGO nanosheets. As an anode for sodium ion batteries, the composite with 13 wt% rGO has 1203.8 and 781.4 mAh g−1 specific capacities for the first discharge and charge, respectively, with 64.9% of Coulombic efficiency, higher than that of pure vanadium sulfide submicrospheres. The sodiation/desodiation mechanism is investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectrum and discharging-charging measurement. The results show that the vanadium sulfide/rGO composite can convert to sodium sulfide + vanadium/rGO composite after the first cycle, and the rGO can inhibit the dissolution of polysulfide while metal vanadium increases electrode conductivity, resulting in the enhanced electrochemical performance.",Solid State Ionics
Atomic cobalt as an efficient electrocatalyst in sulfur cathodes for superior room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2018, The Author(s).The low-cost room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery system is arousing extensive interest owing to its promise for large-scale applications. Although significant efforts have been made, resolving low sulfur reaction activity and severe polysulfide dissolution remains challenging. Here, a sulfur host comprised of atomic cobalt-decorated hollow carbon nanospheres is synthesized to enhance sulfur reactivity and to electrocatalytically reduce polysulfide into the final product, sodium sulfide. The constructed sulfur cathode delivers an initial reversible capacity of 1081 mA h g−1 with 64.7% sulfur utilization rate; significantly, the cell retained a high reversible capacity of 508 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 600 cycles. An excellent rate capability is achieved with an average capacity of 220.3 mA h g−1 at the high current density of 5 A g−1. Moreover, the electrocatalytic effects of atomic cobalt are clearly evidenced by operando Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and density functional theory.",Nature Communications
A room-temperature sodium–sulfur battery with high capacity and stable cycling performance,"© 2018, The Author(s).High-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries operating at 300–350 °C have been commercially applied for large-scale energy storage and conversion. However, the safety concerns greatly inhibit their widespread adoption. Herein, we report a room-temperature sodium–sulfur battery with high electrochemical performances and enhanced safety by employing a “cocktail optimized” electrolyte system, containing propylene carbonate and fluoroethylene carbonate as co-solvents, highly concentrated sodium salt, and indium triiodide as an additive. As verified by first-principle calculation and experimental characterization, the fluoroethylene carbonate solvent and high salt concentration not only dramatically reduce the solubility of sodium polysulfides, but also construct a robust solid-electrolyte interface on the sodium anode upon cycling. Indium triiodide as redox mediator simultaneously increases the kinetic transformation of sodium sulfide on the cathode and forms a passivating indium layer on the anode to prevent it from polysulfide corrosion. The as-developed sodium–sulfur batteries deliver high capacity and long cycling stability.",Nature Communications
"Development, design and applications of structural capacitors","© 2018 Elsevier LtdStructural capacitors are multifunctional structural materials that provide the capacitor function for the purpose of electrical energy storage. This paper reviews the development of structural capacitors and enunciates their design and applications. A structural capacitor is commonly a polymer-matrix structural composite with a dielectric film between the electrodes, which are an electronic conductor, commonly the continuous carbon fiber laminae that serve to reinforce the composite. The dielectric film is preferably small in thickness and serves to avoid short circuiting of the two electrodes. In order to maximize the capacitance by having the structural capacitor constitute capacitors in parallel, the dielectric film is preferably positioned at every interlaminar interface of the composite, such that alternating electrodes in the stack are connected to opposite polarities of the AC electric field source. A structural supercapacitor requires the matrix to be a solid electrolyte. From the viewpoints of structural performance, safety, service life and high frequency capability, structural dielectric capacitors are closer to commercialization readiness than structural supercapacitors. Structural capacitors have not yet been commercialized, but they are expected to provide an untapped, extensive, save and distributed means of energy storage, and allow aircraft, satellites, automobile, ships, wind turbines, buildings, solar panels, display panels, outdoor lighting, computers, cell phones, etc., to store energy in their structures.",Applied Energy
Synthesis and enhanced photocatalytic performance of Ag/AgCl/TiO2 nanocomposites prepared by ion exchange method,"© 2018 The Chinese Ceramic SocietyAg/AgCl/TiO2 nanocomposite was synthesized through the combination of sol-gel process and hydrothermal (HT) method followed by ion exchange method in the paper. Transmission electron microscope, UV–vis absorption property and X-ray diffraction were utilized to characterize the morphology, optical absorption property and phase structure of the as-prepared photocatalysts. The morphological and performance studies of Ag/AgCl/TiO2 revealed that a well-interconnected mixed phase heterojunction photocatalyst was achieved through as-prepared TiO2 and the subsequent ion exchange method. By the degradation of Rhodamine B under xenon lamp, Ag/AgCl/TiO2 exhibited a significant enhancement in photocatalytic activity compared with TiO2 and Ag/TiO2. The band gap of Ag/AgCl/TiO2 can reach to 2.53eV compared with 3.22eV of the prepared TiO2. Furthermore, the synthesis process and photoreaction mechanisms of TiO2, Ag/TiO2 and Ag/AgCl/TiO2 photocatalysts were proposed. It demonstrated that the enhancement of photocatalytic was mainly due to the reducing of electron-hole recombination in Ag/AgCl/TiO2.",Journal of Materiomics
Temperature-Induced Activation of Graphite Co-intercalation Reactions for Glymes and Crown Ethers in Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.The intercalation of solvated ions into graphite leads to ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GICs). Here, we study the impact of temperature on the electrochemical activity of graphite electrodes for co-intercalation reactions between 20 and 80 °C in sodium cells. For this, a range of linear ethers (mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraglyme) are studied. For the first time, pentaglyme and several crown ethers are also investigated. We find that several solvents that appear as unsuitable for the co-intercalation reaction at room temperature provide higher capacities at elevated temperatures. The most evident example is pentaglyme. While poor performance is found at room temperature for this solvent (20 mAhg-1 and large polarization), almost complete utilization (∼110 mAh g-1) and excellent rate capability are obtained at 45 °C. We find that the reactions involving mono-, di-, tetra-, and (at elevated temperatures also) pentaglyme are thermodynamically controlled, whereas the reaction with triglyme is kinetically limited. We also find that the crown ether 18c6 can be used as an electrolyte solvent above its melting point, which, for the first time, demonstrates the synthesis of t-GICs with crown ethers by electrochemical methods. Additionally, parasitic reactions are found to appear at elevated temperatures. Overall, we demonstrate that new co-intercalation reactions can be activated by temperature. The chemistry of these compounds might therefore be much richer than previously thought.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Fabrication of Microporous Sulfur-Doped Carbon Microtubes for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.Developing efficient anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is important for the storage of renewable energy. Inspired by the rapid development of biomass-derived hard carbons and heteroatom-doped carbon materials in various areas, a high-temperature sulfurizing method is exploited for the fabrication of sulfur-doped carbon microtubes (S-CMTs). Owing to high sulfur doping (10.2 wt %) and well-developed microporous structure, the as-prepared S-CMTs show a large charge capacity of 532 mAh g-1 at a current rate of 200 mA g-1, outstanding rate capability (234 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1), and exceptional cycling stability (281 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1), values that are superior to those of biomass-derived carbons reported previously. The excellent electrochemical performance of S-CMTs in full cells paired with N,B-co-doped carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes further demonstrates the feasibility of SIBs. The simple synthesis strategy can potentially be extended to other carbon-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",ACS Applied Energy Materials
Long Cycle Life All-Solid-State Sodium Ion Battery,"Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.All-solid-state sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) based on sulfide electrolytes are considered a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage. However, the limited cycle life of ASIBs largely restricts their practical application. Cycling-stable ASIBs can be achieved only if the designed cathode can simultaneously address challenges including insufficient interfacial contact, electrochemical and chemical instability between the electrode and electrolyte, and strain/stress during operation, rather than just addressing one or part of these challenges. Chevrel phase Mo6S8 has inherent high electronic conductivity and small volume change during sodiation/desodiation, and is chemically and electrochemically stable with the sulfide electrolyte, and therefore the only challenge of using Mo6S8 as the cathode for ASIBs is the insufficient contact between Mo6S8 and the solid electrolyte (SE). Herein, a thin layer of SE is coated on Mo6S8 using a solution method to achieve an intimate contact between Mo6S8 and the SE. Such a SE-coated Mo6S8 cathode enabled an ASIB with a high cycling performance (500 cycles), even much better than that of the liquid-electrolyte batteries with the Mo6S8 cathode. This work provides valuable insights for developing long-cycle life ASIBs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Recent progress in metal–organic frameworks for lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe development of novel electrochemical energy storage systems has induced a great evolution of sustainable production and life. Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries show a significant potential of becoming the next-generation energy storage systems, even though several vital problems, especially the dissolution and loss of active polysulfides, still hinder their practical application. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a novel class of porous crystalline materials, and their derived materials, exhibit great potential for anchoring soluble polysulfides due to the unique physical and surface chemical property. In this review, we dedicate to review strategies for designing MOF-based and MOF-derived materials as hosts and functional polysulfide barriers for Li–S batteries. By revisiting three most important parameters for the design of hosts, namely conductivity, porosity and chemisorption to polysulfides, we hope to gain a greater understanding of how these MOF-related materials promote the electrochemical performance and the cycle stability of Li–S batteries. We also summarize the recent advances of two types of polysulfide barriers working based on an adsorbing-reutilization approach and a blocking approach. Finally, we point out the main challenges and some perspectives for the future development of this promising area.",Polyhedron
Nickel-hydrogen batteries for large-scale energy storage,"© 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Large-scale energy storage is of significance to the integration of renewable energy into electric grid. Despite the dominance of pumped hydroelectricity in the market of grid energy storage, it is limited by the suitable site selection and footprint impact. Rechargeable batteries show increasing interests in the large-scale energy storage; however, the challenging requirement of low-cost materials with long cycle and calendar life restricts most battery chemistries for use in the grid storage. Recently we introduced a concept of manganese-hydrogen battery with Mn2+/MnO2 redox cathode paired with H+/H2 gas anode, which has a long life of 10,000 cycles and with potential for grid energy storage. Here we expand this concept by replacing Mn2+/MnO2 redox with a nickel-based cathode, which enables ∼10× higher areal capacity loading, reaching ∼35 mAh cm−2. We also replace high-cost Pt catalyst on the anode with a low-cost, bifunctional nickel-molybdenum-cobalt alloy, which could effectively catalyze hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions in alkaline electrolyte. Such a nickel-hydrogen battery exhibits an energy density of ∼140 Wh kg−1 (based on active materials) in aqueous electrolyte and excellent rechargeability with negligible capacity decay over 1,500 cycles. The estimated cost of the nickel-hydrogen battery based on active materials reaches as low as ∼$83 per kilowatt-hour, demonstrating attractive characteristics for large-scale energy storage.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Electrolyte Additives for Lithium Metal Anodes and Rechargeable Lithium Metal Batteries: Progress and Perspectives,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium metal (Li0) rechargeable batteries (LMBs), such as systems with a Li0 anode and intercalation and/or conversion type cathode, lithium-sulfur (Li-S), and lithium-oxygen (O2)/air (Li-O2/air) batteries, are becoming increasingly important for electrifying the modern transportation system, with the aim of sustainable mobility. Although some rechargeable LMBs (e.g. Li0/LiFePO4 batteries from Bolloré Bluecar, Li-S batteries from OXIS Energy and Sion Power) are already commercially viable in niche applications, their large-scale deployment is hampered by a number of formidable challenges, including growth of lithium dendrites, electrolyte instability towards high voltage intercalation-type cathodes, the poor electronic and ionic conductivities of sulfur (S8) and O2, as well as their corresponding reduction products (e.g. Li2S and Li2O), dissolution, and shuttling of polysulfide (PS) intermediates. This leads to a short lifecycle, low coulombic/energy efficiency, poor safety, and a high self-discharge rate. The use of electrolyte additives is considered one of the most economical and effective approaches for circumventing these problems. This Review gives an overview of the various functional additives that are being applied and aims to stimulate new avenues for the practical realization of these appealing devices.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
From Nature to Energy Storage: A Novel Sustainable 3D Cross-Linked Chitosan-PEGGE-Based Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Excellent Lithium-Ion Transport Properties for Lithium Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society. Developing a gel polymer electrolyte with a cross-linked structure is one of the best choices to improve the mechanical strength of the gel polymer electrolyte without sacrificing its lithium-ion transportation properties. However, the cost is always too high. Herein, a novel gel polymer electrolyte based on three-dimensional cross-linked chitosan-poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether macromolecule network was designed and synthesized through a simple and environmental harmless method, with sustainable and cheap chitosan as major material. The obtained gel polymer electrolyte shows improved mechanical strength of 5.5 MPa, which is higher than that of other gel polymer electrolytes without inert frameworks. The optimized gel polymer electrolyte exhibits a good lithium ionic conductivity of 2.74 × 10 -4 S cm -1 with a superior lithium-ion transfer number of 0.869 at 25 °C. Lithium battery assembled with this gel polymer electrolyte demonstrates an initial discharge capacity of 146.8 mA h g -1 , which retains 88.49% capacity after 360 cycles at 0.2C. Moreover, this gel polymer electrolyte possesses good interfacial compatibility with lithium anode. Therefore, the growth of lithium dendrite is greatly delayed. This research proves the great possibility of applying sustainable and cost-effective chitosan into gel polymer electrolyte and lithium batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Improving the Stability of an RT-NaS Battery via In Situ Electrochemical Formation of Protective SEI on a Sulfur–Carbon Composite Cathode,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe room temperature sodium sulfur battery (RT-NaS) has attracted considerable attention as a next-generation energy storage system due to its low cost and high specific energy and the abundance of sodium and sulfur. However, the sulfur-based cathode in RT-NaS always undergoes dissolution of polysulfides during the cycle, which limits the utilization of active material and the stability of the RT-NaS. In this study, the authors report an economical and simple method to suppress the dissolution of polysulfides by forming an artificial protective solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the cathode surface using an in situ electrochemical treatment with a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) electrolyte additive. The artificially formed SEI has a thickness of ≈20 nm and contains fluoride anions that improve electrical conductivity and mechanical stability. The RT-NaS full cell with the sulfur–carbon cathode and protective SEI exhibits a 0.1 VNa+/Na lower electrochemical polarization for desodiation, and SEI and electrical resistances that are 23% and 45% lower, respectively, than those of untreated NaS. These improvements lead to a capacity increase of ≈120% (270 to 590 mAh g−1 at the 50th cycle) and a high Coloumbic efficiency of 99.5% in the high-rate cyclability test of the 2 C rate over 200 cycles.",Advanced Sustainable Systems
Characterization of fractionated hardwood kraft lignin with organic solvents,"© EBSCO Information Services 2018. All rights reserved.Hardwood kraft lignin was fractionated with various organic solvents to obtain more homogeneous lignin. Using organic solvent solubility, hardwood kraft lignin was clearly separated into six fractions (F1-F5 and FI) by molecular size. Compared with hardwood kraft lignin, the molecular weight (MW) distribution of each fraction was in a relatively small range and the MW of each fraction (F1-F5) gradually increased from Fl to F5. In addition, thermal stability of the fraction was improved by increasing MW and the resulting glass transition temperature also increased with increasing MW. As a result of Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis, the functional groups of each fraction, except for FI, were very similar. The methoxyl group contents of fractionated lignins from F1 to F5 were 6.2 mmol/g, 2.4 mmol/g, 2.0 mmol/g, 1.9 mmol/g, and 1.6 mmol/g, respectively.

Effect of the particle size of 316L stainless steel on the corrosion characteristics of the steel fabricated by selective laser melting,"© 2018 The Authors.The corrosion characteristics of 316L stainless steel (SS316L) fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) in a 6.0 wt.% FeCl3 solution was investigated in this study. To analyse the relationship between the corrosion factor and powder feedstock, three samples were made by SLM with three particle sizes, and their potentiodynamic polarization curve were measured using a CHI660E electrochemical working station in a 6.0 wt.% FeCl3 solution at 25 °C. The microstructure was investigated by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Corrosion products analyses were performed using an X-ray energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) detection system. The results showed that the SLM samples prepared with fine powder possessed the best surface quality with a much lower porosity and without un-melted powder particles. Compared with the SLM samples from the coarse powder and raw powder, the SLM samples from fine powder exhibited a higher corrosion potential (Ecorr) by 18.94 %, 28.09 % and 67.33 % at the XY-plane, the XZ-plane and the YZ-plane, respectively. However, the corrosion current density (icorr) at the three cross-sections of the SLM sample from fine powder was not lower than that of the other two samples. The weight loss of the SLM sample from fine powder was the highest. These results indicated that the corrosion tendency of the SLM sample from the fine powder was the lowest, but its corrosion rate was the fastest.",International Journal of Electrochemical Science
A Li2S-Based Sacrificial Layer for Stable Operation of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe polysulfide shuttle effect forms a formidable barrier for lithium-sulfur (Li−S) battery technology, as it results in serious side reactions on the anode surface and shortens the battery's cyclability. In this work, we propose a facile yet effective preparation of the Li2S-based sacrificial layer (LSL) as the separator to retard polysulfide crossover. On one hand, before polysulfides (PS) reach the anode surface and react with Li metal, low-order Li2S prefilled inside the porous separator can chemically interact with PS and sterically physically block PS diffusion. On the other hand, the loss of Li2S in LSL can be replenished by the chemical disproportion of polysulfides, rendering the LSL with excellent endurance over cycling. With the optimized LSL, the Li/polysulfide battery achieves a stabilized discharge capacity at 25 °C (>950 mAh g−1 for 300 cycles, 0.5 C) and demonstrates an excellent thermal stability even at 55 °C (>870 mAh g−1 for 150 cycles, 1 C). The strategy is further generalized to other sulfur based batteries (i. e. Na−S battery), offering new opportunities to improve high-energy sulfur-based energy storage technologies.",Energy Technology
Recent advances in effective protection of sodium metal anode,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdBecause of the ultrahigh theoretical capacity, sodium metal is regarded as the most prospective next-generation anode material. However, due to the dendritic sodium formation as well as high chemical reactivity with electrolyte, it still has safety issues and poor cyclability, which have severely impeded the practicability of sodium metal technology. Therefore, it is important for the advanced sodium metal batteries to construct the stable dendrite-free sodium metal anode. In recent years, considerable efforts have been directed towards solving these problems, including sodium-electrode framework design, organic electrolyte modification, sodium-metal interface protection. Furthermore, solid-state electrolytes have an advantage over the liquid electrolytes and are considered to constitute safe solid sodium metal batteries so as to prohibit problematic sodium dendrites. This review comprehensively analyzes the growth mechanism of the sodium dendrites and summarizes recent advances in the strategies of suppressing the formation of sodium dendrite. The practical application in full batteries and future challenges of sodium metal anode are addressed for energy storage devices. We hope this review delivers an overall picture of sodium protection strategies and inspires more researches in the future.",Nano Energy

Through the design of a proper cathode-separator assembly, a deep discharge of the K-S cell with a high utilization of sulfur cathode is accessible.",Energy Storage Materials
Dendrite-free Na metal plating/stripping onto 3D porous Cu hosts,"© 2018Metallic sodium (Na) has been generally regarded as one of the most promising anode materials due to its high specific capacity and natural abundance. However, uneven deposition, large volume change, and dendrite growth during Na plating/stripping process severely restrict its feasibility for energy storage devices. Here we propose a copper nanowire-reinforced three-dimensional (3D) Cu foam current collector (CuNW-Cu) to achieve highly reversible Na storage. The in-situ growth of Cu nanowires can provide abundant active nucleation sites and reduce the local electric current by increasing surface area of the current collector, leading to homogeneous Na deposition. The Na metal anode can run for more than 1400 h (350 cycles) on CuNW-Cu with a low thickness variation of 2% and a stable voltage hysteresis of 25 mV. Moreover, controllable Na loading ranging from 2 to 12 mA h cm−2 can be plated into CuNW-Cu with a long steady life-span over 1000 h and a high Coulombic efficiency over 97.5% owing to the synergistic effect between copper nanowires and interconnected 3D porous Cu foam, which delivers an excellent compatibility for cathodes with different areal loadings. Our results indicate that this hierarchically nanostructured current collector holds great potential for next-generation Na-based batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Advanced Na metal anodes,"© 2018 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesNa metal anode, benefiting from its high theoretical capacity and lowest electrochemical potential, is one of the most favorable candidates for future Na-based batteries with high energy density. Dendrite growth, volume change and high reactivity are the formidable challenges in terms of good cycling performance and high Coulombic efficiency as well as an expected safety guarantee of Na metal anode for the practical application. Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer as an indispensable component of a battery, its formation and stability play the critical role in the feasibility of Na metal anode. In this review, we first discuss the current consideration and challenges of Na metal anode, and then summarize several strategies to suppress dendrite growth and improve electrochemical performance, including interface engineering, electrolyte composition, electrode construction, and so on. Finally, the conclusion and future perspective of potential development on Na metal anode are proposed.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Multi-electron reaction materials for sodium-based batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdSodium-based rechargeable batteries are very promising energy storage and conversion systems owing to their wide availability and the low cost of Na resources, which is beneficial to large-scale electric energy storage applications in future. In the context of attempting to achieve high-energy densities and low cost, multi-electron reaction materials for both cathodes and anodes are attracting significant attention due to high specific capacities involved. Here, we present a brief review on recently reported multi-electron reaction materials for sodium-based batteries. We mostly concentrate on true multi-electron reactions that involve individually valence changes greater than one per redox center, but in addition include materials in the discussion, which undergo multi-electron processes per formula unit. The theoretical gravimetric and volumetric (expanded state) capacities are studied for a broad range of examples. Then, the practically achievable volumetric energy density and specific energy of Na cells with hard carbon, sodium (Na), and phosphorus (P) anodes are compared. For this purpose, various data are recalculated and referred to the same basis cell. The results show the potential superiority of the cells using multi-electron reaction materials and provide an intuitive understanding of the practically achievable energy densities in future Na-based rechargeable batteries. However, these multi-electron reaction materials are facing several key challenges, which are preventing their high-performance in current cells. In order to overcome them, general strategies from particle design to electrolyte modification are reviewed and several examples in both cathode and anode materials using such strategies are studied. Finally, future trends and perspectives for achieving promising Na-based batteries with better performance are discussed.",Materials Today
Nitrogen and Sulfur Co-Doped Graphene Nanosheets to Improve Anode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) attract more attention because of sodium's abundant availability, affordable price, and potential to be an effective anode material. Meanwhile, carbon-based materials provide the most promising anode materials. Because of the large radius of sodium ions, SIBs do not exhibit favorable electrochemical performance. Introducing heteroatoms into the carbon-lattice is an effective strategy to enlarge the interlayer space of carbon-based materials which can improve carbon's electrochemical performance. In addition, anode materials with a surface-induced capacitive process can enhance the SIB's electrochemical performance because its capacitive process increases the kinetics of ion diffusion. Here, we describe an SIB's anode material containing nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene sheets [denoted as poly(2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole) (PDMcT)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO)] which are synthesized via carbonization of PDMcT polymerized on the surface of GO. PDMcT/RGO exhibited high capacities (240 mA h g-1 at 500 mA g-1), improved rate performance (144 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1), and good cycling stability (153 mA h g-1 after 5000 cycles at 5000 mA g-1). These unique results are attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing and electronic conductivity from the heteroatoms which facilitate the sodium ion's insertion and electron transport. These results represent that PDMcT/RGO is a great potential anode material for SIBs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
A Robust Integrated SnOx/Carbon Composite Anode for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimTin (Sn) has been considered as a promising anode material for sodium ion battery due to its high specific capacity. However, its poor cycling stability and rate performance hinders the real application. Inspired by the structure of reinforced concrete and tunnel, an integrated SnOx/carbon composite anode was designed for high performance sodium ion batteries. In this structure, the SnOx nanoparticles were embedded in the amorphous carbon with interconnected pores derived from carbonization of the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and starch, where the amorphous carbon can buffer the bulk expansion of SnOx to maintain structural stability and the interconnected pores can store the electrolyte to promote the sodium ion transportation for high rate reaction of the SnOx particles with sodium ion. The reduced graphene oxide as robust framework similar with rebar is inserted into the amorphous carbon/SnOx composite to enhance the stability and conductivity of composite. The starch as pore-creating additive is decomposed during high-heat treatment to form interconnected tunnel-like pores in SnOx/carbon composite for electrolyte storage and high efficient sodium ion transportation. As a result, the as-prepared integrated SnOx/carbon composite anode shows outstanding rate and cycling performance. Constructing the interconnected pore in SnOx/carbon composite using starch can greatly improve its charge specific capacity and rate performance.",ChemistrySelect
Recent Progress in Rechargeable Potassium Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe topic of sustainable and eco-friendly energy storage technologies is an issue of global significance. To date, this heavy burden is solely addressed by lithium-ion battery technology. However, the ongoing depletion of limited global lithium resources has restricted their future availability for Li-ion battery technology, and hence, a significant price increase is expected. This grim situation is the driving force for the development of the “beyond Li-ion battery” strategy involving alternatives that have several advantages over conventional Li-ion batteries in terms of cost, durability, safety, and sustainability. Potassium, the closest neighboring alkali element after sodium, offers some unique advantages over lithium and sodium as a charge carrier in rechargeable batteries. Potassium intercalation chemistry in potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) is successfully demonstrated to be compatible with Li-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries. In addition to KIBs, potassium–sulfur and potassium–oxygen batteries have emerged as new energy-storage systems due to their low costs and high specific energy densities. This review covers the key technological developments and scientific challenges for a broad range of rechargeable potassium batteries, while also providing valuable insight into the scientific and practical issues concerning the development of potassium-based rechargeable batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
3D Selenium Sulfide@Carbon Nanotube Array as Long-Life and High-Rate Cathode Material for Lithium Storage,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimA 3D selenium sulfide@carbon nanotube array is designed and synthesized by encapsulating and anchoring a large amount of selenium sulfide (SexS8− x) into boron- and nitrogen-codoped vertically aligned carbon nanotubes. Successfully employed as cathode material for the lithium metal battery, it exhibits long cycling lifetime and high rate capability with high energy density. Vertically aligned carbon nanotubes can not only enable fast migration to realize excellent rate capability and efficient utilization of the SexS8− x loaded inside, but also provide optimal unidirectional void space to significantly reduce volumetric expansion and the polysulfide shuttling phenomenon during the cycling process. Meanwhile, the graphene layers decorated by element doping and held together by COOH- and OH-enriched poly(acrylic acid) binder can efficiently consolidate SexS8− x molecules inside the carbon nanotubes and prevent the separation of the active materials from the current collector during long-term cycling. Benefiting from these features, the composite presents optimal cycling performance with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 96% and a high reversible capacity of 818 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g−1. This composite thus represents one of the most promising cathode materials that can give the lithium metal battery long cycle life and remarkable power density.",Advanced Functional Materials
Room-Temperature Liquid Na–K Anode Membranes,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe Na–K alloy is a liquid at 25 °C over a large compositional range. The liquid alloy is also immiscible in the organic-liquid electrolytes of an alkali-ion rechargeable battery, providing dendrite-free liquid alkali-metal batteries with a liquid–liquid anode-electrolyte interface at room temperature. The two liquids are each immobilized in a porous matrix. In previous work, the porous matrix used to immobilize the alloy was a carbon paper that is wet by the alloy at 420 °C; the alloy remains in the paper at room temperature. Here we report a room-temperature vacuum infiltration of the alloy into a porous Cu or Al membrane and a reversible stripping/plating of the liquid alloy with the immobilized organic-liquid electrolyte; no self-diacharge is observed since the liquid Na–K does not dissolve into the liquid carbonate electrolytes. The preparation and stripping/plating of the liquid alkali-metal anode can both now be done safely at room temperature.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Conducting Polymer Paper-Derived Mesoporous 3D N-doped Carbon Current Collectors for Na and Li Metal Anodes: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Herein, the manufacturing of a free-standing N-doped mesoporous carbon (CPPY) paper by straightforward carbonization of polypyrrole-coated nanocellulose paper is described. The deposition of Na and Li on these CPPY electrodes, which also serve as current collectors, is studied using a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations. The porous CPPY electrodes gave rise to decreased current densities, which helped to prolong the life-time of the Na electrodes. While the density functional theory calculations suggest that both Na and Li should be deposited uniformly on the CPPY electrodes, the experimental results clearly show that the sodium deposition was more well-defined on the surface of the CPPY electrodes. In contrast to Li, dendrite-free Na depositions could be carried out using deposition capacities up to 12 mAh cm-2 and a stable Na electrode cycling performance was found during 1000 h at 1 mA cm-2. The results suggest that it was difficult to predict the Na or Li deposition behavior merely based on calculations of the metal adsorption energies, as kinetic effects should also be taken into account. Nevertheless, the experimental results clearly show that the use of the present type of porous electrodes provides new possibilities for the development of durable Na electrodes for high-performance sodium metal batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
"Glass formation and structural analysis of Na4P2S7-xOx, 0 ≤ x ≤ 7 sodium oxy-thiophosphate glasses","© 2018 Elsevier B.V.The short-range order (SRO) structures of glasses in the Na4P2S7-xOx, 0 ≤ x ≤ 7 system were investigated on samples prepared by planetary ball milling (PBM). Like other glasses prepared by PBM, the glassy nature of the prepared materials was confirmed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) showing that they were structurally amorphous and by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showing that each composition exhibited a reproducible glass transition temperature (Tg). The SRO structure of these glasses were determined using a combination of Raman, Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), and 31P Magic Angle Spinning NMR (MAS NMR) spectroscopies to investigate how oxygen and sulfur are bonded in the various SRO structural units that were found in these glasses. The three spectroscopic techniques gave further evidence that the resulting glasses were completely reacted from their starting polycrystalline materials Na2S, P2S5 and P2O5. It was found that significant disproportionation reactions occur in these compositions in which the original as-batched and expected pyro-phosphate SRO units, P1 = 2 Na/P, for x = 0 undergo a transformation to form charge compensated amounts of ortho-phosphate (P0, 3 Na/P) and meta-phosphate (P2, 1 Na/P) SRO structures with increasing x such that there is a conservation of Na+ charge, on average 2Na/P. In this nomenclature, the superscript is the total number of bridging sulfurs (BSs) and bridging oxygens (BOs), three minus the superscript is the number of Na per P, and four minus the superscript is the total number of non-bridging sulfurs (NBSs) and non-bridging oxygens (NBOs) on each of the SRO units. As seen in earlier work on other mixed oxy-sulfide (MOS) glass forming systems, the stronger Lewis base O=, compared to S=, is found to preferentially form BOs in the form of P2 units by bonding to the stronger Lewis acid P+5, compared to Na+. This leaves the weaker Lewis base S= to bond to the weaker Lewis acid, Na+, in the form of NBSs on the charge compensation required P0 groups. Using both charge balance and quantitative 31P MAS NMR measurements, a complete composition map of all of the SRO structures present in these glasses has been determined.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids
Dendrite-Free Li Metal Anode for Rechargeable Li-SO2 Batteries Employing Surface Modification with a NaAlCl4-2SO2 Electrolyte,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Dendritic growth of a Li metal anode during cycling is one of major issues to be addressed for practical application of Li metal rechargeable batteries. Herein, we demonstrate that surface modification of Li metal with a Na-containing SO2 electrolyte can be an effective way to prevent dendritic Li growth during cell operation. The surface-modified Li metal anode exhibited no dendritic deposits even under a high areal capacity (5 mA h cm-2) and a high current density (3 mA cm-2), whereas the unmodified anode showed typical filamentary Li deposition. The surface-modified Li metal anode also demonstrated significantly enhanced electrochemical performance, which could be attributed to the newly formed Na-containing inorganic surface layer that exhibits uniform and dense properties. Consequently, surface modification with a Na-containing SO2 inorganic electrolyte is suggested as one of the most effective ways to realize a highly stable Li metal anode with dendrite-free Li deposition for Li metal-based rechargeable batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Sulfur Spillover on Carbon Materials and Possible Impacts on Metal–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThere is currently intense research on sulfur/carbon composite materials as positive electrodes for rechargeable batteries. Such composites are commonly prepared by ball milling or (melt/solution) impregnation to achieve intimate contact between both elements with the hope to improve battery performance. Herein, we report that sulfur shows an unexpected “spillover” effect when in contact with porous carbon materials under ambient conditions. When sulfur and porous carbon are gently mixed in a 1:1 mass ratio, complete surface coverage takes place within just a few days along with the loss of the sulfur bulk properties (crystallinity, melting point, Raman signals). Sulfur spillover also occurs in the presence of a liquid phase. Consequences of this phenomenon are discussed by considering a sodium–sulfur cell with a solid electrolyte membrane.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Designing MOFs-Derived FeS2@Carbon Composites for High-Rate Sodium Ion Storage with Capacitive Contributions,"Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.Sodium-ion batteries suffer the disadvantages of poor rate performance and cycling stability due to its sluggish sodiation kinetics. A rational design strategy for both materials compositions and structures has been proposed to meet these challenges. Herein, a triple-component composite derived from metal-organic frameworks, comprising FeS2, nitrogen-sulfur co-doped porous carbon, and reduced graphene oxide (FeS2@NSC/G), has been successfully synthesized. With the capacities contributions from different sodium storage routes (diffusion-controlled processes and surface capacitive processes) at varies rate conditions, it is aiming to make full use of each component in the electrode composite and their unique porous structures. Expected electrode properties have been achieved and related electrochemical behaviors have also been investigated. The strategy would present a promising thought for composites design, which could enhance high-rate electrochemical energy storage performances.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
"Review of electrical energy storage technologies, materials and systems: Challenges and prospects for large-scale grid storage","© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Increased interest in electrical energy storage is in large part driven by the explosive growth in intermittent renewable sources such as wind and solar as well as the global drive towards decarbonizing the energy economy. However, the existing electrical grid systems in place globally are not equipped to handle mass scale integration of intermittent energy sources without serious disruptions to the grid. It is generally agreed that more than 20% penetration from intermittent renewables can greatly destabilize the grid system. Certainly, large-scale electrical energy storage systems may alleviate many of the inherent inefficiencies and deficiencies in the grid system, and help improve grid reliability, facilitate full integration of intermittent renewable sources, and effectively manage power generation. Electrical energy storage offers two other important advantages. First, it decouples electricity generation from the load or electricity user, thus making it easier to regulate supply and demand. Second, it allows distributed storage opportunities for local grids, or microgrids, which greatly improve grid security, and hence, energy security. Currently, there is only 170 GW of installed storage capacity around the world, but more than 96% is provided by pumped-hydro, which is site-constrained and not available widely. Hence, a battery of technologies is needed to fully address the widely varying needs for large-scale electrical storage. The focus of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of a broad portfolio of electrical energy storage technologies, materials and systems, and present recent advances and progress as well as challenges yet to overcome. The article discusses the status and options for mechanical, thermal, electrochemical, and chemical storage. Where appropriate, it also provides tutorial level background information on fundamental principles for the interested non-expert. It is hoped that this article is of interest to the uninitiated as well as active scientists and engineers engaged in energy storage technologies, with particular focus on large-scale electrical energy storage.",Energy and Environmental Science
FeS2 nanosheets encapsulated in 3D porous carbon spheres for excellent Na storage in sodium-ion batteries,"© 2018 the Partner Organisations.FeS2 nanosheets encapsulated in 3D porous carbon spheres (FeS2@C-2 h) were fabricated by a series of treatments using Fe2O3 hollow nanospheres as starting materials. We first fabricated Fe2O3@PPy by a facile process in solution. Then, Fe2O3@PPy was converted to Fe3O4@C by annealing treatment under an Ar atmosphere. Fe3O4@C composites were etched in HCl and they formed Fe3O4 nanoparticles dispersed in porous carbon hollow spheres. Finally, the FeS2 nanosheets encapsulated in porous carbon hollow spheres were obtained by a sulfidation treatment. Thus, the FeS2-carbon structure is believed to be beneficial for improving the sodium storage performance of the products. Our experimental results show that FeS2@C-2 h exhibit a significantly improved electrochemical performance compared with pure FeS2 without carbon coating and etching when used as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. At a current density of 500 mA g-1, the FeS2@C-2 h anode delivered a high capacity of 514.9 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles. The capacity of 420.1 mA h g-1, 410.5 mA h g-1 and 396.6 mA h g-1 can be achieved at high current densities of 1000, 2000 and 3000 mA g-1 after 200 cycles, respectively. The capacity is still as high as 272.4 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at a higher current density of 5000 mA g-1. The excellent electrochemical performance suggests that the FeS2@C-2 h nanomaterials hold potential to serve as electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers

However, the Na metal anode faces several challenges, including: (1) the formation of Na dendrites and short circuiting; (2) low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and poor cycling performance; and (3) an infinite volume change due to its hostless nature. Furthermore, the issues associated with Na metal anodes have also been noticed in practical Na metal batteries (NMBs). In recent years, the importance of the Na metal anode has been highlighted and many studies have provided potential solutions to address the issues of its use. This review article focuses on the recent developments of Na metal anodes, including insight into the fundamental understanding of its electrochemical processes, novel characterization methods, approaches for protecting the anode and future perspectives.

Amorphous germanium as a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries: a first principle study,"© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The abundance of sodium (Na), its low-cost, and low reduction potential provide a lucrative inexpensive, safe, and environmentally benign alternative to lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The significant challenges in advancing sodium ion battery (NIB) technologies lie in finding the better electrode materials. Experimental investigations revealed the real potency of germanium (Ge) as suitable anode materials for NIBs. However, a systematic atomistic study is necessary to understand the fundamental aspects of capacity–voltage correlation, microstructural changes of Ge, as well as diffusion kinetics. We, therefore, performed the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulation to investigate the sodiation–desodiation kinetics in germanium–sodium system (Na64Ge64). We analyzed the intercalation potential and capacity correlation for intermediate equilibrium structures and compared our data with the experimental results. Effect of sodiation on inter-atomic distances within Na–Ge system is analyzed by means of Pair Correlation Function (PCF). This provides insight into possible microstructural changes taking place during sodiation of amorphous Ge (a-Ge). We further investigated the diffusivity of sodium in a-Ge electrode material and analyzed the volume expansion trend for Na64Ge64 electrode system. Our computational results provide the fundamental insight into the atomic scale and help experimentalists design Ge-based NIBs for real-life applications.",Journal of Materials Science
Mo2C embedded in S-doped carbon nanofibers for high-rate performance and long-life time Na-ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.We succeed in obtaining Mo2C embedded in S-doped carbon (Mo2C/SC) nanofibers by electrospinning and sulfuration. The use of S-doped carbon not only provides more additional Na+ storage active sites to enhance its sodium storage performance, but also increases electrons migration and ions diffusion. As the anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), the electrode exhibits excellent rate capacities of 242 and 96 mA h g−1 from 0.1 A g−1 to 5 A g−1. Excitingly, the high-rate performance is superior, achieving 102.7 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 over 1000th cycle.

However, it has the disadvantage with regard to the dissolution of active materials in organic electrolyte. In this study, we encapsulated high capacity material calix[4]quinone (C4Q) in the nanochannels of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) CMK-3 with various mass ratios ranging from 1:3 to 3:1, and then systematically investigated their morphology and electrochemical properties. The nanocomposites characterizations confirmed that C4Q is almost entirely capsulated in the nanosized pores of the CMK-3 while the mass ratio is less than 2:1. As cathodes in lithium-ion batteries, the C4Q/CMK-3 (1:2) nanocomposite exhibits optimal initial discharge capacity of 427 mA h g−1 with 58.7% cycling retention after 100 cycles.

Insight into Sulfur Confined in Ultramicroporous Carbon,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Here, we provide a deeper insight into the state of sulfur confined in ultramicroporous carbon (UMC) and clarify its electrochemical reaction mechanism with lithium by corroborating the results obtained using various experimental techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In combination, these results indicate that sulfur in UMC exists as linear polymeric sulfur rather than smaller allotropes. The electrochemical reactivity of lithium with sulfur confined in UMC (pore size ≤0.7 nm) is different from that of sulfur confined in microporous carbon (≤2 nm, or ultramicroporous carbon containing significant amount of micropores) and mesoporous carbon (>2 nm). The observed quasi-solid-state reaction of lithium with sulfur in UMC with a single voltage plateau during the discharge/charge process is due to the effective separation of solvent molecules from the active material. The size of carbon pores plays a vital role in determining the reaction path of lithium with sulfur confined in UMC.",ACS Omega
Improving ionic conductivity of Nasicon (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) at intermediate temperatures by modifying phase transition behavior,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Molten sodium (Na) anode high temperature batteries, such as Na-NiCl2 and Na-S, draw attentions to be used in stationary electricity storage applications. Recent efforts are exerted to lower their operating temperatures down to below 200 °C in order to adopt ultra-low cost cell production, establish easier maintenance, pursue enhanced safety, and more. One of main challenges in lowering the operation temperature is radical decrease in ionic conductivity of their solid electrolytes. Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (Nasicon) is considered as a solid electrolyte for the lower temperature operation. Here we report Na ionic conductivity of Nasicon at 150 °C increases by adding Ge element. The ionic conductivity of Ge-added sample (Na3[Zr2-δGeδ]Si2PO12, δ = 0.1, 0.2) is measured as high as 1.4 × 10−2 S cm-1 at 150 °C which is about two times higher than those of the bare Nasicon. The phase transition temperature of the Ge-added samples is lowered, thereby the volume fraction of the rhombohedral phase, which is stable at higher temperatures and exhibits higher Na ion conductivities, increases. This finding provides a useful guideline to further increase the ionic conductivity of Nasicon solid electrolytes, which can advance materialization of lower temperature operating Na batteries.",Journal of Power Sources
Ultra-stable sodium ion battery cathode realized by Cu7S4 nanoparticles,"© 2018Sodium ion battery attracts significant attentions due to its unlimited sodium resources and low cost. However, sodium ion battery usually suffers from the cathode materials’ low capacity and poor cyclic stability. Here we demonstrate that the ultrafine Cu7S4 nanoparticles as cathode for sodium ion battery, which is in-situ generated during the cycling of commercial sulfur/graphene composite electrodes, can enable superior specific capacity and ultra-stable cycling performance. The Cu7S4 has an open crystal structure for Na+ insertion, the graphene conductive networks ensure the fast transportation of electrons and also provide more active sites, and the ultrafine-sized Cu7S4 with a larger specific surface area guarantees efficiently electrochemical reactions. Thus, the ultrafine Cu7S4 nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets composite exhibit a high capacity of 585.5 mAh g−1 (0.41 mAh cm−2) at the current density of 100 mA g−1, ultra-stable cycling performance even after 2000 cycles with a capacity of 409.9 mAh g−1 (0.29 mAh cm−2) at a current density of 500 mA g−1 and excellent rate performance even at the highest current density of 2000 mA g−1 with a reversible capacity of 277.1 mAh g−1 (0.19 mAh cm−2).",Journal of Power Sources
PEG400-assisted synthesis of oxygen-incorporated MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets supported on reduced graphene oxide for sodium ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Oxygen-incorporated MoS2 (OI-MoS2) ultrathin nanosheets have been successfully fabricated using a PEG400-assisted one-pot hydrothermal method. The role of polyethylene-glycol 400 (PEG400) in promoting the formation of long-range ordered single-phase OI-MoS2 has not been investigated previously. In our study, we demonstrate that polyethylene-glycol 400 (PEG400) can act as a surfactant to reduce nanosheet aggregation. Furthermore, it can function as a structural modifier to regulate the degree of sulfidation and stabilize the oxygen-incorporated structure with larger interlayer spacing and higher intrinsic electronic conductivity for facilitating sodiation/de-sodiation reactions. A very low content of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is enough to provide a highway for electron transport between adjacent OI-MoS2 layers, and prevent OI-MoS2 layers from stacking in the [002] direction. Enhanced electrochemical performance is observed in the OI-MoS2/L-rGO nanosheets with carbonate-based electrolyte, delivering a discharge capacity of 462 mAh g−1 during the 2nd cycle with 89.1% capacity retention after 50 cycles.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
High-Capacity All-Solid-State Sodium Metal Battery with Hybrid Polymer Electrolytes,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAll-solid-state sodium metal batteries (SSMBs) are of great interest for their high theoretical capacity, nonflammability, and relatively low cost owing partially to the abundance of sodium recourses. However, it is challenging to fabricate SSMBs because compared with their counterparts, which contain lithium metal, sodium metal is mechanically softer and more reactive toward the electrolyte. Herein, the synthesis and electrochemical properties of newly designed sodium-containing hybrid network solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) and their application in SSMBs are reported. The hybrid network is synthesized by controlled crosslinking of octakis(3-glycidyloxypropyldimethylsiloxy)octasilsesquioxane and amine-terminated polyethylene glycol in existence with sodium perchlorate (NaClO4). Plating and stripping experiments using symmetric cells show prolonged cycle life of the SPEs, >5150 and 3550 h at current density of 0.1 and 0.5 mA cm−2, respectively. The results for the first time show that the SPE|sodium metal interface migrates into the SPE phase upon cycling. SSMBs fabricated with the hybrid SPE sandwiched between sodium metal anode and bilayered δ-NaxV2O5 cathode exhibit record-high specific capacity for solid sodium-ion batteries of 305 mAh g−1 and excellent Coulombic efficiency. This work demonstrates that the hybrid network SPEs are promising for SSMB applications.",Advanced Energy Materials
Three-Dimensional Carbon-Honeycomb as Nanoporous Lithium and Sodium Deposition Scaffold,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Using the density functional theory method, we demonstrate that the recently synthesized three-dimensional carbon-honeycomb (C-honeycomb) can serve as a promising nanoporous scaffold for both lithium and sodium deposition with good electronic conductivity. Lithium/sodium can insert into the channels of C-honeycomb with low migration energy barriers along the walls of one-dimensional pores (<0.5 eV for lithium and <0.25 eV for sodium) and exist in the form of metal nanorods. A high theoretical capacity (711 mAh/g, almost twice that of graphite) can be achieved when the one-dimensional pores are filled with lithium/sodium atoms. The volume expansion of the C-honeycomb after metal insertion is less than 5 and 15% for lithium and sodium, respectively. Further introduction of defects such as pyridinic-N doping or single vacancy can provide initial nucleation sites for the metal nanorods and increase the open-circuit voltage.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Porous Molybdenum Carbide Nanorods as Novel “Bifunctional” Cathode Material for Li-S Batteries,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe shuttle effect of polysulfide is the primary obstacle in Li-S batteries. Although some effort has been made to suppress the shuttle process, more highly conductive materials with stronger adsorption ability to polysulfides are still in urgent demand. Another important problem is the deteriorating performance of Li-S batteries with prolonged cycling owing to irreversible deposition of lithium sulfide (Li2S). However, a host material for the effective conversion of insoluble Li2S has been elusive up to now. Herein, porous molybdenum carbide nanorods (Mo2C NRs), with high catalytic activity for Li2S and ultrastrong adsorption for polysulfides, are used as a “bifunctional” host material and incorporated into sulfur cathodes for the first time. The “bifunctional” Mo2C NRs have the advantage of immobilizing polysulfides over the conventional host, with adsorption energies from −4.89 to −8.20 eV for Li2Sx (x=1, 2, 4, 6, and 8). The electrochemical analysis shows that Mo2C NRs, more than an anchor, can activate Li2S by greatly reducing the charging overpotential. Therefore, the irreversible deposition of polysulfides is effectively restrained and the utilization of Li2S is clearly enhanced. The Mo2C NRs–sulfur composites (Mo2C NRs-S) cathodes provide a capacity of 1298 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C in the Li-S batteries. More importantly, the battery with Mo2C NRs-S cathodes exhibits a much lower capacity decay of 0.062 % per cycle at 1 C over 500 cycles.",Chemistry - A European Journal
Electrolyte and Interface Engineering for Solid-State Sodium Batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier Inc.Sodium batteries are considered as promising candidates for large-scale energy-storage systems owing to the abundant and low-cost sodium resources. However, many reported sodium batteries are based on conventional organic liquid electrolyte, which would lead to potential safety issues. Developing solid-state electrolyte (SSE) for sodium batteries is an effective way to solve such problems. Nevertheless, how to develop high-performance SSE and compatible interface for constructing solid-state sodium batteries is still challenging. In this review, we mainly focus on the development and recent advances of SSE (including all-solid-state and quasi-solid-state electrolyte) and interface engineering for sodium batteries. The structure-property correlations and design principles of different inorganic and organic SSE are discussed in depth. The comprehensive performance of SSE depends on the structural characteristics such as defects, crystallinity, and stability of bonds. The design principles mainly include increasing the density of mobile Na+ ions, reducing the energy barrier, immobilizing anions, adjusting the stability of bonds, adding specific buffer layers, and increasing interfacial contact area. Moreover, we discuss the interface between SSE and electrode because a suitable interface is the key prerequisite for high-performance solid-state sodium batteries. This review provides fundamental insights and future perspectives to design advanced SSE and concomitant interface for next-generation rechargeable solid-state sodium batteries. The recent boom in electronics and electric vehicles has raised the demand for rechargeable batteries. However, safety issues of rechargeable batteries based on liquid electrolyte such as ethers and carbonate esters are common due to the flammability of organic solvent and hazards of electrolyte leakage. In recent years, solid-state sodium batteries have attracted extensive attention because of their improved safety, considerable energy density, and low cost. Nevertheless, high-performance solid-state electrolyte and compatible interface are still absent and need to be further developed for constructing solid-state sodium batteries. The development and recent advances of solid-state electrolyte and concomitant interface issues for sodium batteries are systematically summarized in this review. We discuss the fundamental principles in the design of solid-state electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, high transference number, and high chemical/electrochemical stability. Furthermore, we highlight the design of interface between electrolyte and electrode, which is the key challenge in developing high-performance solid-state sodium batteries. Thus, future investigations of solid-state sodium batteries should focus on anode/electrolyte/cathode interface through the combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies. Meanwhile, large-scale production of high-performance solid-state electrolyte via a facile and scalable method with low cost is also necessary. This review introduces the development and recent progress of different types of solid-state electrolyte for sodium batteries, including β-alumina, NASICON, sulfide-based electrolyte, complex hydrides, and organic electrolyte. In particular, the transport mechanism, ionic conductivity, ionic transference number, chemical/electrochemical stability, and mechanical properties of solid-state electrolyte for sodium batteries are summarized. Meanwhile, the interface issues of anode/electrolyte/cathode (interfacial contact and chemical compatibility) are discussed in depth with the aim of constructing high-performance solid-state sodium batteries.",Joule
Double-Morphology CoS2 Anchored on N-Doped Multichannel Carbon Nanofibers as High-Performance Anode Materials for Na-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted increasing attention given the fact that sodium is relatively more plentiful and affordable than lithium for sustainable and large-scale energy storage systems. However, the shortage of electrode materials with outstanding comprehensive properties has limited the practical implementations of NIBs. Among all the discovered anode materials, transition-metal sulfide has been proven as one of the most competitive and promising ones due to its excellent redox reversibility and relatively high theoretical capacity. In this study, double-morphology N-doped CoS2/multichannel carbon nanofibers composites (CoS2/MCNFs) are precisely designed, which overcome common issues such as the poor cycling life and inferior rate performance of CoS2 electrodes. The conductive 3D interconnected multichannel nanostructure of CoS2/MCNFs provides efficient buffer zones for the release of mechanical stresses from Na+ ions intercalation/deintercalation. The synergy of the diverse structural features enables a robust frame and a rapid electrochemical reaction in CoS2/MCNFs anode, resulting in an impressive long-term cycling life of 900 cycles with a capacity of 620 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 (86.4% theoretical capacity) and a surprisingly high-power output. The proposed design in this study provides a rational and novel thought for fabricating electrode materials.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Advanced Characterization Techniques in Promoting Mechanism Understanding for Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Engineering Materials for Progressive All-Solid-State Na Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Following the prevalence of the Li-ion battery for electrical energy storage systems (EESs), the world is looking toward alternative, cost-effective, electrical EESs for portable electronics, electric vehicles, and grid storage from renewable sources. Na-based batteries are the most promising candidates and show similar chemistry as Li-based batteries. All-solid-state sodium batteries (AS3Bs) have attracted great attention due to safe operation, high energy density, and wide operational temperature. Herein, current development of solid-state crystalline borate- and chalcogenide-based Na-ion conductors is discussed together with historically important Na-β-alumina and Na superionic conductors (NASICONs). Furthermore, we report on engineering a ceramic Na-ion electrolyte and electrode interface, which is considered a bottleneck for practical applications of solid-state electrolytes in AS3Bs. A soft Na-ion conducting interlayer is critical to suppress the interfacial Na-ion charge transfer resistance between the solid electrolyte and electrode. Several Na-ion conducting ionic liquids, polymers, gels, crystalline plastics interlayers, and other interfacial modification strategies have been effectively employed in advanced AS3Bs.",ACS Energy Letters
"Ethers Illume Sodium-Based Battery Chemistry: Uniqueness, Surprise, and Challenges","© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have the potential to be practically applied in large-scale energy storage markets. The rapid progress of SIBs research is primarily focused on electrodes, while electrolytes attract less attention. Indeed, the improvement of electrode performance is arguably correlated with the electrolyte optimization. In conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), ether-based electrolytes are historically less practical owing to the insufficient passivation of both anodes and cathodes. As an important class of aprotic electrolytes, ethers have revived with the emerging lithium-sulfur and lithium-oxygen batteries in recent years, and are even booming in the wave of SIBs. Ether-based electrolytes are unique to enabling these new battery chemistries in terms of producing stable ternary graphite intercalation compounds, modifying anode solid electrolyte interphases, reducing the solubility of intermediates, and decreasing polarization. Better still, ether-based electrolytes are compatible with specific inorganic cathodes and could catalyze the assembly of full SIBs prototypes. This Research News article aims to summarize the recent critical reports on ether-based electrolytes in sodium-based batteries, to unveil the uniqueness of ether-based electrolytes to advancing diverse electrode materials, and to shed light on the viability and challenges of ether-based electrolytes in future sodium-based battery chemistries.",Advanced Energy Materials
"Polarizable Molecular Dynamics and Experiments of 1,2-Dimethoxyethane Electrolytes with Lithium and Sodium Salts: Structure and Transport Properties","© 2018 American Chemical Society.The structure and transport properties of electrolyte solutions of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) having salts of Li+ with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([TFSI]-) or Na+ with [TFSI]- are investigated with polarizable molecular dynamics and experiments. Polarizable force fields for Li+ and Na+ with DME and [TFSI]- were developed based on quantum chemistry calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and thermodynamic liquid-state properties. Simulation results for density, viscosity, self-diffusion coefficient, and conductivity of the electrolytes all agree well with the trends and magnitudes of available experimental data for a wide range of salt concentrations. As the concentration of salt increases, the electrolytes become more viscous and molecular species become less mobile. Ionic conductivity does not change monotonically with salt concentration and exhibits a maximum between 0.5 and 1.0 M for both Li[TFSI] and Na[TFSI] electrolytes. Comparatively, both cations are solvated by 5-6 DME or [TFSI]- oxygen atoms and exhibit similar diffusivities and conductivities. The solvation shell of Na+ is found to be more weakly bound and to have a lower binding residence time than that of Li+. The transport of Li+ therefore is more vehicular, through the motion of the solvation shell, while the transport of Na+ is based more on exchange, through the replacement of solvating species. The atomistic insight provided by this work can be used as the basis for future rational design of improved electrolyte solvents for lithium-oxygen, sodium-oxygen, and lithium-sulfur batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry B
Nitrogen and Oxygen Co-doped Graphitized Carbon Fibers with Sodiophilic-Rich Sites Guide Uniform Sodium Nucleation for Ultrahigh-Capacity Sodium-Metal Anodes,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Sodium (Na) metal is an ideal anode for high-energy Na batteries due to the low cost and natural abundance of Na metal. Nevertheless, issues regarding dendritic and mossy Na metal deposits have prevented their practical application. Herein, nitrogen and oxygen co-doped graphitized carbon fibers (DGCF) have been developed as the Na plating hosts to direct Na metal homogeneous nucleation and suppress the growth of Na dendrites. We show experimental results as well as first-principles calculations demonstrating that the uniformly doped nitrogen and oxygen function as sodiophilic sites that direct the sodium-metal nucleation to a smooth dendrite-free anode. The resultant DGCF-Na anode can be cycled stably at 1 mA cm-2 for a high areal capacity of 12.7 mA h cm-2 with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8%, and a Na|Na symmetrical cell can be cycled with long-term durability for more than 1200 h at 2 mA cm-2.

Soft Colloidal Glasses as Solid-State Electrolytes,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Solid-state electrolytes are an attractive alternative to conventional liquid electrolytes in lithium batteries because of their intrinsic safety features and superior mechanical properties. Maintaining high bulk and interfacial ion fluxes in batteries that utilize solid-state electrolytes remains a significant challenge. We report on synthesis and electrochemical properties of a class of solid-state polymer electrolytes composed of silica nanoparticles covalently grafted with poly(ethylene oxide) chains. By regulating the salt content in the materials, we find that it is possible to drive microstructural changes, including nanoparticle arrangements, to achieve appreciable levels of bulk and interfacial ionic conductivity at room temperature. Additionally, we show that electrolyte salt additives can be used to create cathode-electrolyte interphases (CEI) that increase the oxidative stability of all PEO-based electrolytes. Finally, we report that solid-state lithium batteries comprised of a high-voltage nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM) cathode, metallic Li anode, and a solid-state hybrid polymer electrolyte can be cycled stably with high levels of reversibility.",Chemistry of Materials
TiO2 quantum dots decorated multi-walled carbon nanotubes as the multifunctional separator for highly stable lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdLithium sulfur battery is considered one of the most promising rechargeable energy storage devices due to its ultrahigh theoretical energy density and specific capacity. It still cannot be applied because of some key problems. In particular, the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfide compounds leads to the rapid attenuation of battery capacity, short cycle life and serious self-discharge effect. TiO2 quantum dots and polysulfide compounds have strong interactions and can capture soluble polysulfide compounds, thus inhibiting the shuttle effect. Herein, we introduce a battery separator based on TiO2 quantum dots modified multi walled carbon nanotubes to solve the shuttle effect and adapt to the expansion of electrodes during charging and discharging. The interlayer has abundant spacing and excellent conductivity. This strategy can significantly improve the stability of lithium sulfur batteries. As a result, Li-S cells with MWCNTs@TiO2 quantum dots modified separator deliver an initial capacity of 1083 mAh g−1 and keep a cycle capacity of 610 mAh g−1 after 600 cycles at the rate of 838 mA g−1, which maintains an average capacity decay of only 0.072% per cycle. This simple and effective method can greatly improve the application capacity of lithium sulfur batteries.",Electrochimica Acta

Hierarchically Porous Fe2CoSe4 Binary-Metal Selenide for Extraordinary Rate Performance and Durable Anode of Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimOwing to high energy capacities, transition metal chalcogenides have drawn significant research attention as the promising electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, limited cycle life and inferior rate capabilities still hinder their practical application. Improvement of the intrinsic conductivity by smart choice of elemental combination along with carbon coupling of the nanostructures may result in excellence of rate capability and prolonged cycling stability. Herein, a hierarchically porous binary transition metal selenide (Fe2CoSe4, termed as FCSe) nanomaterial with improved intrinsic conductivity was prepared through an exclusive methodology. The hierarchically porous structure, intimate nanoparticle–carbon matrix contact, and better intrinsic conductivity result in extraordinary electrochemical performance through their synergistic effect.

Hierarchical iron sulfide-graphene nanocubes consisting of multiple nanoparticles with superior sodium ion storage properties,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdHierarchical iron sulfide nanocubes consisting of multiple iron sulfide-carbon core-shell nanoparticles coated with few-layer graphene (Fe1-xS@C/rGO) were prepared by a two-step in-situ transformation strategy employing Prussian blue (PB) as a starting material. The hierarchical nanocubes delivered an outstanding rate capability of 323 mAh g−1 at the current density of 10 A g−1 when used as the anode of sodium ion half cells. An iron-based sodium-ion full cell composed of a hierarchical Fe1-xS@C/rGO anode and PB cathode had a capacity of 323 mAh g−1 for 150 cycles. We attributed the good sodium ion storage properties of the Fe1-xS@C/rGO nanocubes to the stable hierarchical building structures and the high graphitization degree of carbon obtained during the transformation process. The graphene-coated nanocube structures inhibited the agglomeration of iron sulfide-carbon core-shell nanoparticles and accommodated the huge volume expansion that occurred during cycling. The high graphitization degree of carbon endowed Fe1-xS@C/rGO nanocubes with high electronic conductivity, facilitated sodium ion accessibility, and increased mechanical durability.",Electrochimica Acta
"Binder-free, freestanding cathodes fabricated with an ultra-rapid diffusion of sulfur into carbon nanofiber mat for lithium–sulfur batteries","© 2018A rapid (5-s) sulfur deposition technique is demonstrated on electrospun carbon nanofibers to fabricate binder-free, freestanding cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries. The 5-second procedure melts sulfur into carbon nanofiber mats, which play a significant role as a built-in conductive matrix to provide uninterrupted electron transport pathways throughout the electrode such that the heavy current collector is eliminated. Meanwhile, the large inter-fiber spacing facilitates electrolyte diffusion and provides sufficient space for sulfur integration during cathode fabrication and the volume expansion during lithium-sulfur redox reaction. This technique eliminates the need for slurry processing with insulating binders and toxic solvents while eliminating heavy current collectors. This ultra-rapid technique involving only 140 °C, 5 s, and slight pressure (<250 psi) offers a practical approach to light-weight sulfur cathodes compared to the conventional sulfur melt deposition techniques requiring high temperatures (155–300 °C), long times (8–10 h), and heavy components in the cell assembly. The cathodes thus obtained deliver a discharge capacity of ∼550 mAh gsulfur −1 owing to their simple construction, with 100% capacity retention at 0.5C rate over 150 cycles. This translates to ∼250 mA h gelectrode −1 (based on total mass at the cathode) which is comparable to highly sophisticated electrodes when the weight of the entire electrode and current collector is considered.",Materials Today Energy
NiMn layered double hydroxides derived multiphase Mn-doped Ni sulfides with reduced graphene oxide composites as anode materials with superior cycling stability for sodium ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdSodium ion batteries have been drawing attention in recent years as the next generation batteries, due to the even distribution and abundance of sodium source. Metal sulfides as the promising sodium ion battery anode materials have the advantages of relatively high electronic conductivity than the metal oxides and high theoretical capacity. However, the accompanied severe volume changes upon de/sodiation often lead to fast capacity decay, poor rate capability and unsatisfactory cycling stability. In our work, multiphase Mn-doped Ni sulfides (NMS) nanoparticles were obtained by sulfidation process, the NMS nanoparticles deliver higher electronic conductivity and larger sodium diffusion coefficient than the multiphase Ni sulfides (NS) nanoparticles, resulting in a better rate performance. With the addition of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), NMS nanoparticles anchored on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (NMGS) were obtained. The optimized NMGS can deliver specific capacity of 460.9 mAh/g at a current density of 50 mA/g, while retaining a capacity of 169.4 mAh/g at an increased current density of 5000 mA/g, demonstrating good rate performance. In addition, when the ether-based electrolyte (1 M NaCF3SO3 in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether) is used, the NMGS can maintain a capacity of 229.2 mAh/g at high current density of 5000 mA/g, and retain capacity of 206.1 mAh/g at 500 mA/g after 2000 cycles. The high specific capacity, great rate performance with excellent cycling stability emphasizes the promising potential of NMGS as sodium ion battery anodes.",Materials Today Energy
Carbon hollow nanobubbles on porous carbon nanofibers: An ideal host for high-performance sodium-sulfur batteries and hydrogen storage,"© 2018One-dimensional (1D) carbon nanostructures have been intensively investigated because of their intriguing features and great potential for practical application in various fields. This paper reports the controllable fabrication of carbon hollow nanobubbles on porous carbon nanofibers (CHNBs@PCNFs) through a general electrospinning strategy, with metal azides serving as both a bubbling and a porogen reagent. The strong repulsive forces resulting from the intense release of N2 from the decomposition of metal azides upon carbonization leads to the uniform formation of porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs), which could be facile tuned by heating rates and the amount of the bubbling reagent, simultaneously constructed with carbon hollow nanobubbles (CHNBs) on the surface. Density functional theory calculations reveal the strong interactions between terminal Na atoms in sodium polysulfides and N and O atoms doped into CHNBs@PCNFs, which could effectively alleviate the shuttle effect of Na-S batteries via adsorbing and trapping polysulfides. With strong adsorption capability of sodium polysulfides and high electrical conductivity, these CHNBs@PCNFs are demonstrated to be an ideal sulfur host in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries, which delivers a high reversible capacity of 256 mA h g−1 (specific energy density 384 W h kg−1) with a low decay rate of 0.044% per cycle at 2 C-rate. When CHNBs@PCNFs used as functional supports for MgH2 nanoparticles, a significantly enhanced hydrogen storage performance was achieved. The present work represents a critically important step in advancing the electrospinning technique for generating 1D carbon nanostructures in a facile and universal manner.",Energy Storage Materials
Nanostructured Bi2S3 encapsulated within three-dimensional N-doped graphene as active and flexible anodes for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2018, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been increasingly attracting attention as a sustainable alternative to lithium-ion batteries for scalable energy storage. The key to advanced SIBs relies heavily upon the development of reliable anodes. In this respect, Bi2S3 has been extensively investigated because of its high capacity, tailorable morphology, and low cost. However, the common practices of incorporating carbon species to enhance the electrical conductivity and accommodate the volume change of Bi2S3 anodes so as to boost their durability for Na storage have met with limited success. Herein, we report a simple method to realize the encapsulation of Bi2S3 nanorods within three-dimensional, nitrogen-doped graphene (3DNG) frameworks, targeting flexible and active composite anodes for SIBs. The Bi2S3/3DNG composites displayed outstanding Na storage behavior with a high reversible capacity (649 mAh·g–1 at 62.5 mA·g–1) and favorable durability (307 and 200 mAh·g–1 after 100 cycles at 125 and 312.5 mA·g–1, respectively). In-depth characterization by in situ X-ray diffraction revealed that the intriguing Na storage process of Bi2S3 was based upon a reversible reaction. Furthermore, a full, flexible SIB cell with Na0.4MnO2 cathode and as-prepared composite anode was successfully assembled, and holds a great promise for next-generation, wearable energy storage applications.

Na3NH2B12H12 as high performance solid electrolyte for all-solid-state Na-ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Solid electrolyte with stable and fast Na+ ionic conductivity is of central importance in the development of all-solid-state sodium batteries.

Remedies of capacity fading in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Liquid-electrolyte sodium-sulfur battery operated at room temperature is encountering challenges brought by the complex sulfur redox reactions, including (i) the dissolved polysulfide intermediates trigger serious side reactions on Na anode surface; (ii) the short-chain sulfide precipitation exhibits sluggish kinetics and the sulfur utilization is generally below 50% with unclear reasons. In this work, employing an ion selective polybenzimidazole-based separator we successfully suppress the polysulfide corrosion on the Na anode, which allows the investigation of the precipitation reaction. Combining DFT calculation and characterization techniques, we determine Na2S2 particles as the final discharge product and reveal that Na2S2 passivation is the predominant attributes of large polarization and capacity fading. To address these issues, we present the use of a bifunctional NaI-P2S5 based electrolyte additive, which (i) improves the Na2S2 precipitation kinetics by forming soluble Na2S2-P2S5 complex and (ii) promotes the dissolution of Na2S2 by the chemical mediation of I−/ I3−. As a result, a much improved capacity retention (92.9% for 50 cycles at 0.2C) is attained, which sheds light on enabling the stable operation of sodium-sulfur batteries via combining advanced separator and electrolyte engineering strategies.",Journal of Power Sources
A Flexible Sulfur-Enriched Nitrogen Doped Multichannel Hollow Carbon Nanofibers Film for High Performance Sodium Storage,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this work, a sulfur-enriched N-doped multichannel hollow carbon nanofiber (denoted as S-NCNF) film is prepared through electrospinning technology and heat treatment with sublimed sulfur as the flexible anode for sodium ion batteries (NIBs). The S-NCNF film displays outstanding electrochemical performance, particularly with a high rate capacity (132 mA h g−1 at the current density of 10 A g−1) and remarkable long cycling stability (reversible specific capacity of 187 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 over 2000 cycles). The improved sodium storage performance results from the unique 3D structure, abundant defects, and increased interlayer spacing of S-NCNFs. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate that nitrogenous carbon nanofibers doping with sulfur could not only promote the adsorption of sodium but also favor electrons' transfer. This strategy has been demonstrated as a general process to design free-standing carbon-based thin film with other heteroatom doping.",Small
Cation-Directed Selective Polysulfide Stabilization in Alkali Metal-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Alkali metal sulfur redox chemistry offers promising potential for high-energy-density energy storage. Fundamental understanding of alkali metal sulfur redox reactions is the prerequisite for rational designs of electrode and electrolyte. Here, we revealed a strong impact of alkali metal cation (Li+, Na+, K+, and Rb+) on polysulfide (PS) stability, redox reversibility, and solid product passivation. We employed operando UV-vis spectroscopy to show that strongly negatively charged short-chain PS (e.g., S4 2-/S3 2-) is more stabilized in the electrolyte with larger cation (e.g., Rb+) than that with the smaller cation (e.g., Li+), which is attributed to a stronger cation-anion electrostatic interaction between Rb+ and S4 2-/S3 2- owing to its weaker solvation energy. In contrast, Li+ is much more strongly solvated by solvent and thus exhibits a weaker electrostatic interaction with S4 2-/S3 2-. The stabilization of short-chain PS in K+-, Rb+-sulfur cells promotes the reduction of long-chain PS to short-chain PS, leading to high discharge potential. However, it discourages the oxidation of short-chain PS to long-chain PS, leading to poor charge reversibility. Our work directly probes alkali metal-sulfur redox chemistry in operando and provides critical insights into alkali metal sulfur reaction mechanism.",Journal of the American Chemical Society
A Hybrid Electrolytes Design for Capacity-Equivalent Dual-Graphite Battery with Superior Long-Term Cycle Life,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimBased on cation/anion graphite intercalation chemistry (GIC) processes, dual-graphite batteries promise to be an energy storage device of high safety and low cost. However, few single electrolyte systems can simultaneously meet the requirements of both high oxidative stability during high voltage anion-GIC on cathode and high reversibility upon cation-GIC on anode. Thus, in order to rigidly remedy the irreversible capacity loss, excessive electrode materials need to be fabricated within full cell, resulting in an imbalance toward capacity-dependent mass loading proportion between both electrodes. This work introduces a hybrid (dual-organic) electrolytes design strategy into this promising technology. Segregated by a Nafion-based separator, an ionic liquid electrolyte within the cathodic side can endure high operation potentials, while high Li-GIC reversibility can be achieved in a superconcentrated ether-based electrolyte on the anode side. On a mechanistic level, various cation-GIC processes conducted in different electrolyte systems are clearly revealed and are summarized based on systematical characterizations. More importantly, after synergistically tuning the advantage and drawback of each electrolyte in this hybrid system, the dual-graphite full cell assembled with capacity-equivalent graphite-based electrodes (1:1 mass loading) demonstrates superior long-term cycling stability with ultrahigh capacity retention for over 3000 cycles.",Advanced Energy Materials
Role of Disorder in NaO2 and Its Implications for Na-O2 Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.There is a need for more energy dense batteries, and Na-O2 batteries have emerged as an attractive option. In this work, we present a density functional theory (DFT) study utilizing the Hubbard U correction to probe structural and magnetic disorder in NaO2, the primary discharge product of Na-O2 batteries. We show that NaO2 exhibits a large degree of rotational and magnetic disorder. A three-body Ising model is necessary to capture the subtle interplay of this disorder. Our Monte Carlo (MC) simulations demonstrate for the first time that energetically favorable, ferromagnetic (FM) phases near room temperature consist of alternating bands of O2 dimers oriented along two of four cubic cell body diagonals. Using hybrid density functional theory calculations, we find that bulk structures are insulating, with a subset of FM structures showing a moderate gap (<2 eV) in one spin channel. The insulating nature of NaO2 implies that growth of the discharge product is most likely occurring due to the solution mechanism pathway involving a chemical dissolution of NaO2 into Na+ and O2 -, similar to what is seen in Li-O2 batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Systematic post-synthetic modification of metal-organic framework (ZIF-67) with superior cyclability for lithium-ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdIn this work, carboxyl groups were introduced on the organic ligands of ZIF-67 through post-synthetic modification (-CH3→-CH2Br→-CHO→-COOH). A thin layer of Ag nanoparticles (3 nm in diameter) coating was deposited on external surface of ZIF-67 crystals through the reaction between the aldehyde groups in the ligands and silver ammonia solution. The carboxyl groups can participate in the lithium storage while the Ag nanoparticles coating help in increasing the conductivity. Electrochemical properties of the modified ZIF-67 electrodes are examined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. Benefiting from the outstanding conductivity of Ag nanoparticles and the synergistic effect between Ag nanoparticles and the modified ZIF-67, the composite exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance compared to its ZIF-67 counterpart. Nearly an invariable capacity of 800 mA h g−1 is maintained up to 100 cycles at 0.28 C (1C = 137 mA g−1) with a Coulombic efficiency of 99%. Furthermore, the ex situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies on the electrode material under different states suggest that the Co ions remain in the Co2+ state during the charging/discharging process and the usual conversion reaction mechanism for lithium storage might not be suitable for the modified ZIF-67 electrode material.",Electrochimica Acta

Sodium-ion batteries: New opportunities beyond energy storage by lithium,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Sodium has been recently attracted considerable attention as a promising charge carrier, but this sudden attention has made the strategy of research somewhat hazy, as most research reports are indeed the examination of typical materials rather than following a solid roadmap for developing practical cells. Although the history of sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) is as old as that of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the potential of NIB had been neglected for decades until recently. Most of the current electrode materials of NIBs have been previously examined in LIBs. Therefore, a better connection of these two sister energy storage systems can shed light on the possibilities for the pragmatic design of NIBs. The first step is to realise the fundamental differences between the kinetics and thermodynamics of Na as compared with those of Li. In fact, tiny differences between the electrochemical behaviours of these systems can lead us to new practical ideas for designing suitable materials. Furthermore, NIBs should be considered as new opportunities for energy storage rather than replacing LIBs. Hence, the subtle strategy of research is to learn from LIBs but not replicate them when designing NIBs.",Journal of Power Sources
"Mesoporous, conductive molybdenum nitride as efficient sulfur hosts for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries","© 2018 Elsevier B.V.The insulating nature of sulfur and the shuttling of polysulfides are two major fundamental issues that have to be tackled in Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, generally leading to low sulfur utilization and fast capacity decay. Constructing sulfur hosts with both excellent conductivity and efficient polysulfides immobilization is critical to the successful implementation of Li-S batteries. Herein, mesoporous molybdenum nitride (Mo2N) with interconnected structures is readily designed as sulfur hosts to resolve the low conductivity and polysulfides dissolution issues. The specific surface area and the conductivity of the mesoporous Mo2N are verified to be 121 m2 g−1 and 1 × 105 S m−1, respectively. Along with its high polarity enabling the chemisorption of polysulfides, the as-obtained mesoporous Mo2N is promising as sulfur host. The polysulfides dissolution is efficiently suppressed owing to the fruitful nanospaces in the mesoporous Mo2N that offer more exposed polar interfaces for intensive chemical affinity/adsorption with polysulfides. Encouragingly, the as-prepared mesoporous, conductive and polar Mo2N with sulfur delivers superior capacity of 995 mA h g−1, long cycle stability (91.9% capacity retention after 100 cycles), superior to those of Nonporous-Mo2N/S and Mesoporous-MoO3/S. Our results reveal that vivid engineering of metal nitrides via creating nanopores is promising for pursuing high-performance Li-S batteries.",Journal of Power Sources
A Stable Quasi-Solid-State Sodium–Sulfur Battery,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAmbient-temperature sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries are considered a promising energy storage system due to their high theoretical energy density and low costs. However, great challenges remain in achieving a high rechargeable capacity and long cycle life. Herein we report a stable quasi-solid-state Na-S battery enabled by a poly(S-pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA))-based cathode and a (PETEA-tris[2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl] isocyanurate (THEICTA))-based gel polymer electrolyte. The polymeric sulfur electrode strongly anchors sulfur through chemical binding and inhibits the shuttle effect. Meanwhile, the in situ formed polymer electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and enhanced safety successfully stabilizes the Na anode/electrolyte interface, and simultaneously immobilizes soluble Na polysulfides. The as-developed quasi-solid-state Na-S cells exhibit a high reversible capacity of 877 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C and an extended cycling stability.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Simultaneously Exfoliated Boron-Doped Graphene Sheets to Encapsulate Sulfur for Applications in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.Heteroatom-doped high-quality graphene is highly effective in encapsulating sulfur (S) and fabricating a high-performance electrode for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, simultaneously exfoliated boron-doped graphene sheets (B-EEGs) are prepared via electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in a 1.0 mol L-1 Li bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB)/dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) electrolyte. The obtained B-EEG possesses high quality with a large planar size of ∼11 μm, few structure defects of ID/IG = 0.26, and low oxygen content of 7.93%. After B-EEG is used to encapsulate S through an in situ deposition route, the S@B-EEG with an S content of 72.5% displays a high initial discharge capacity of 1476 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C. Compared to a conventional S@thermally reduced graphene oxide (S@T-RGO) composite, the S@B-EEG composite exhibits a high capability of 1018 mAh g-1 at 1 C and excellent capacity retention of 838 mAh g-1 after 130 cycles. On one hand, the excellent electrochemical performances of S@B-EEG are primarily attributed to the few defects and big planar size of B-EEG, which is helpful for increasing the conductivity of S and suppressing the shuttle of long-chain polysulfides. On the other hand, the doped boron atoms as active sites can efficiently trap polysulfides by chemical adsorption.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
CuS Microspheres with Tunable Interlayer Space and Micropore as a High-Rate and Long-Life Anode for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLayered transition metal sulfides (LTMSs) have tremendous commercial potential in anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) in large-scale energy storage application. However, it is a great challenge for most LTMS electrodes to have long cycling life and high-rate capability due to their larger volume expansion and the formation of soluble polysulfide intermediates caused by the conversion reaction. Herein, layered CuS microspheres with tunable interlayer space and pore volumes are reported through a cost-effective interaction method using a cationic surfactant of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). The CuS–CTAB microsphere as an anode for SIBs reveals a high reversible capacity of 684.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and 312.5 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 1000 cycles with high capacity retention of 90.6%. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique structure of this material, and a high pseudocapacitive contribution ensures its high-rate performance. Moreover, in situ X-ray diffraction is applied to investigate their sodium storage mechanism. It is found that the long chain CTAB in the CuS provides buffer space, traps polysulfides, and restrains the further growth of Cu particles during the conversion reaction process that ensure the long cycling stability and high reversibility of the electrode material.",Advanced Energy Materials
A Layered–Tunnel Intergrowth Structure for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Oxide Cathode,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimDelivery of high-energy density with long cycle life is facing a severe challenge in developing cathode materials for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Here a composite Na0.6MnO2 with layered–tunnel structure combining intergrowth morphology of nanoplates and nanorods for SIBs, which is clearly confirmed by micro scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy as well as scanning transmission electron microscopy with atomic resolution is presented. Owing to the integrated advantages of P2 layered structure with high capacity and that of the tunnel structure with excellent cycling stability and superior rate performance, the composite electrode delivers a reversible discharge capacity of 198.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2C rate, leading to a high-energy density of 520.4 Wh kg−1. This intergrowth integration engineering strategy may modulate the physical and chemical properties in oxide cathodes and provide new perspectives on the optimal design of high-energy density and high-stable materials for SIBs.",Advanced Energy Materials
Chemical Immobilization and Conversion of Active Polysulfides Directly by Copper Current Collector: A New Approach to Enabling Stable Room-Temperature Li-S and Na-S Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRoom-temperature Li/Na-S batteries are promising energy storage solutions, but unfortunately suffer from serious cycling problems rooted in their polysulfide intermediates. The conventional strategy to tackle this issue is to design host materials for trapping polysulfides via weak physical confinement and interfacial chemical interactions. Even though beneficial, their capability for the polysulfide immobilization is still limited. Herein, the unique sulfiphilic nature of metallic Cu is revisited. Upon the exposure to polysulfide in aqueous or aprotic solution, the surface sulfidization rapidly takes place, resulting in the formation of Cu2S nanoflake arrays with tunable texture. When the sulfidized Cu current collector is directly used as the sulfur-equivalent cathode, it enables high-performance Li/Na-S batteries at room temperature with reasonable high sulfur loading. Specific capacities up to ≈1200 mAh g−1 for Li-S and ≈400 mAh g−1 for Na-S are measured when normalized to the amount of equivalent sulfur, and can be readily sustained for >1000 cycles.",Advanced Energy Materials

Research on this system is currently in its infancy, and its development is still faced with many challenges in terms of high charge potential, weak rate capability, and poor cyclability. Moreover, the reaction mechanism in the battery is still unclear and hard to determine, due to the generation of carbon along with metal carbonates on the cathode.

Internal structure – Na storage mechanisms – Electrochemical performance relations in carbons,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThis review focuses on carbon-based sodium ion battery (NIB) negative electrodes, emphasizing the internal structure – Na storage mechanisms – electrochemical performance relations. We bring a unique vantage to the ever-expanding field of NIB anode literature: To quantify the critical emphasis on the structure – properties interdependence, we provide comprehensive data comparisons of representative published studies. This is accomplished through a series of “Master Plots”, which rather than focusing on an individual publication, combine the data by broad features first outlined in the taxonomy section. The advantage of such an approach is that it transcends the paper-to-paper differences in electrochemical performance in a given class of anodes, providing generalizable comparisons that are statistically significant. For instance, we manage to demonstrate that, while N-doped carbons have a slight advantage in terms of capacity, their rate performance at higher currents is unchanged over that of undoped carbons. To our knowledge such broad high-level data analysis has not been done in past reviews on either NIB or LIB carbon anodes. Furthermore, we also discuss a wide range of individual microstructures and chemistries, offering critical analysis when appropriate.",Progress in Materials Science

Sulfur Diffusion within Nitrogen-Doped Ordered Mesoporous Carbons Determined by in Situ X-ray Scattering,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.The low intrinsic conductivity of sulfur necessitates conductive additives, such as mesoporous carbons, to the cathode to enable high-performance metal-sulfur batteries. Simultaneous efforts to address polysulfide shuttling have introduced nitrogen-doped carbons to provide both conductivity and suppressed shuttling because of their strong interaction with sulfur. The strength of this interaction will impact the ability to fill the mesopores with sulfur via melt infusion. Here, we systematically investigate how nitrogen doping influences the rate that molten sulfur can infiltrate the mesopores and the overall extent of pore filling of highly ordered mesoporous doped carbons using in situ small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The similarity in electron density between molten sulfur and the soft carbon framework of the mesoporous material leads to a precipitous decrease in the scattered intensity associated with the ordered structure as voids are filled with sulfur. As the nitrogen doping increases from 1 to 20 at. %, the effective diffusivity of sulfur in the mesopores decreases by an order of magnitude (2.7 × 10-8 to 2.3 × 10-9 cm/s). The scattering becomes nearly invariant within 20 min of melt infiltration at 155 °C for all but the most doped carbon, which indicates that submicron-sized mesoporous carbon particles can be filled rapidly. Additionally, the nitrogen doping decreases the sulfur content that can be accommodated within the mesopores from 95% of the mesopores filled without doping to only 64% filled with 20 at. % N as determined by the residual scattering intensity. Sulfur does not crystallize within the mesopores of the nitrogen-doped carbons, which is further indicative of the strong interactions between the nitrogen species and sulfur that can inhibit polysulfide shuttling. In situ SAXS provides insights into the diffusion of sulfur in mesopores and how the surface chemistry of nitrogen-doped carbon appears to significantly hinder the infiltration by sulfur.",Langmuir
A Chemically Engineered Porous Copper Matrix with Cylindrical Core–Shell Skeleton as a Stable Host for Metallic Sodium Anodes,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium (Na) metal is the most promising alternative for lithium metal as anode for the next-generation energy storage systems. However, its practical implementation is hindered by the huge volume change and severe Na metal dendrite growth during electrochemical stripping/plating. Herein, the use of a chemically engineered porous copper (Cu) matrix as a stable host for metallic Na anode is presented. By treating the commercial Cu foam through a facile and cost-effective method, a composite matrix consists of cylindrical core–shell skeleton is achieved, facilitating uniform impregnation and confinement of Na within the matrix pores promoted by the chemical interaction between Na and the matrix. The unique matrix's surface characteristic can divert the Na deposition from the skeleton towards the Na reservoirs within the pores, suppressing the volume change and mossy/dendritic Na growth. A stable Na cycling behavior is demonstrated in carbonate electrolyte without any additives at a high capacity up to 3 mAh cm−2 with a current density up to 2 mA cm−2. Moreover, electrochemical measurements of a full cell made of the Na composite matrix anode clearly reveal the superior performance at high rate (5C) over that using bare Na metal.",Advanced Functional Materials
Preparation of amorphous Ni-W coating for the current collector of Na/S battery by electrodeposition,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Stainless steel 430 (SS430) was usually used as current collector of sodium‑sulfur batteries, but it had limited corrosion resistance in high temperature sulfur environment. In this paper, the amorphous Ni-W coating was synthesized on the SS430 surface by the electrodeposition technique. The element Ce was added to improve the density of the coating moreover. Their structure and electrical conductivity were investigated by XRD, SEM, XPS and four probe tester respectively. The corrosion resistance of SS430 and two kinds of coatings had been studied in sulfur environment at 350 °C. The results indicated that amorphous Ni-W coating could slow down the corrosion of SS430 in high temperature molten sulfur environment and improve the conductivity. And the introduction of Ce could prompt the crystalline bulks refinement and the microstructure compact. The corrosion rate of Ni-W-Ce coating was 0.0612 mm/y after corrosion for 120 h in high temperature sulfur environment and the block resistance was 0.3055 mΩ.",Surface and Coatings Technology
Vapor-Infiltration Approach toward Selenium/Reduced Graphene Oxide Composites Enabling Stable and High-Capacity Sodium Storage,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Emerging sodium-selenium batteries suffer from volume expansion of the selenium cathode and shuttling effects of soluble intermediates. Confining selenium within the carbon matrix is the most adopted strategy to address these two issues, which is generally realized via a melt-infusion method. Herein, we developed a vapor-infiltration method to fabricate selenium/carbon composites that are advantageous over the melt-infusion route in terms of several aspects: it relieves the requirement of intensive mechanical mixing and simplifies the ratio optimization between selenium and carbon; it avoids selenium aggregation and makes it possible to utilize all of the surface and pores of the carbon host. Utilizing this method, we fabricated a selenium/graphene composite from thermally reduced graphene oxide with a selenium loading equal to 71 wt %, thus approaching the record value. The obtained composite achieved the highest reported to date initial Coulombic efficiency of 88% among various selenium cathodes, with superior rate and cycle performance (410 and 367 mA h g-1 at 0.1 and 1 A g-1 capacity decay <10% after 800 cycles at 2 A g-1) enabled by the supporting graphene framework and the use of the ether electrolyte. In view of the distinct advantages of the vapor-infiltration method and the significant influence of the ether electrolyte on both initial Coulombic efficiency and cyclability of the batteries, we believe the introduced approach will be frequently adopted to incorporate selenium into various host materials, and the ether electrolyte will be widely considered for selenium-based electrodes.",ACS Nano
Cross-Linking Hollow Carbon Sheet Encapsulated CuP2 Nanocomposites for High Energy Density Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Sodium-ion batteries (SIB) are regarded as the most promising competitors to lithium-ion batteries in spite of expected electrochemical disadvantages. Here a ""cross-linking"" strategy is proposed to mitigate the typical SIB problems. We present a SIB full battery that exhibits a working potential of 3.3 V and an energy density of 180 Wh kg-1 with good cycle life. The anode is composed of cross-linking hollow carbon sheet encapsulated CuP2 nanoparticles (CHCS-CuP2) and a cathode of carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (C-NVPF). For the preparation of the CHCS-CuP2 nanocomposites, we develop an in situ phosphorization approach, which is superior to mechanical mixing. Such CHCS-CuP2 nanocomposites deliver a high reversible capacity of 451 mAh g-1 at 80 mA g-1, showing an excellent capacity retention ratio of 91% in 200 cycles together with good rate capability and stable cycling performance. Post mortem analysis reveals that the cross-linking hollow carbon sheet structure as well as the initially formed SEI layers are well preserved. Moreover, the inner electrochemical resistances do not significantly change. We believe that the presented battery system provides significant progress regarding practical application of SIB.",ACS Nano
Tin(IV) Sulfide Greatly Improves the Catalytic Performance of UiO-66 for Carbon Dioxide Cycloaddition,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimTo overcome the limitations of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for catalysis (e.g., low catalytic activities resulting from blockage of the active metal centers by organic linkers) is of great importance. Herein, we demonstrate the formation of UiO-66 nanoparticles with ultrasmall size and linker defects with the aid of SnS2 nanosheets. The UiO-66 nanoparticles supported by SnS2 nanosheets were found to exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with propylene oxide under solvent-free and co-catalyst-free conditions. Outstandingly, the catalytic activity was 11 times higher than that of the pure UiO-66 catalyst under optimum conditions. We thus provide a promising route to modify MOF particles thus to promote their catalytic performance.",ChemCatChem
Dendrite-Free Sodium-Metal Anodes for High-Energy Sodium-Metal Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium (Na) metal is one of the most promising electrode materials for next-generation low-cost rechargeable batteries. However, the challenges caused by dendrite growth on Na metal anodes restrict practical applications of rechargeable Na metal batteries. Herein, a nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon nanotube (NSCNT) paper is used as the interlayer to control Na nucleation behavior and suppress the Na dendrite growth. The N- and S-containing functional groups on the carbon nanotubes induce the NSCNTs to be highly “sodiophilic,” which can guide the initial Na nucleation and direct Na to distribute uniformly on the NSCNT paper. As a result, the Na-metal-based anode (Na/NSCNT anode) exhibits a dendrite-free morphology during repeated Na plating and striping and excellent cycling stability. As a proof of concept, it is also demonstrated that the electrochemical performance of sodium–oxygen (Na–O2) batteries using the Na/NSCNT anodes show significantly improved cycling performances compared with Na–O2 batteries with bare Na metal anodes. This work opens a new avenue for the development of next-generation high-energy-density sodium-metal batteries.",Advanced Materials
"High-Voltage, Room-Temperature Liquid Metal Flow Battery Enabled by Na-K|K-β″-Alumina Stability","© 2018 Elsevier Inc.Flow batteries are a compelling grid-scale energy storage technology because the stored energy is decoupled from the system power. Aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs), however, are limited by low open-circuit voltages (OCVs). Replacing the aqueous negative electrolyte (negolyte) with liquid alkali metals—of which Na-K, a room-temperature liquid metal alloy, is attractive—would increase the OCV considerably. However, a suitable solid electrolyte has not been reported for Na-K. Here we show that K-β″-alumina is a selective and robust K+ ion conductor in contact with Na-K, to which it is stable with minimal exchange of Na. We report the cycling of cells with OCVs of 3.1–3.4 V employing aqueous and nonaqueous positive electrolytes (posolytes), and power density tests showing promising maximum power densities of 65 mW cm−2 at 22°C and >100 mW cm−2 at 57°C, ohmically limited by 330-μm K-β″-alumina membranes. Further development of Na-K|K-β″-alumina batteries could unlock cost-effective energy storage. Flow batteries are a compelling grid-scale energy storage technology because the stored energy is decoupled from the system power. Conventional flow batteries have aqueous solutions on both sides, and thus are constrained in voltage by water splitting (∼1.5 V). Replacing the negative side with a liquid metal would yield a much higher voltage flow battery, benefiting energy density, power density, and efficiency. As a room-temperature liquid metal, Na-K is attractive. However, a suitable solid electrolyte has not been reported for Na-K since the well-studied Na-β″-alumina ceramic fractures on contact. Here we show that K-β″-alumina is a selective and robust K+ ion conductor in contact with Na-K. We report the cycling of cells with open-circuit voltages of 3.1–3.4 V. Our maximum power densities are limited, as expected, by the K-β″-alumina membranes, but can be improved with thin membranes. Further development of Na-K|K-β″-alumina batteries could unlock cost-effective energy storage. Na-K is a room-temperature liquid metal that could unlock a high-voltage flow battery. We show that K-β″-alumina solid electrolyte is stable to Na-K and selectively transports K+.

High-Performance Sodium Metal Anodes Enabled by a Bifunctional Potassium Salt,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimDeveloping Na metal anodes that can be deeply cycled with high efficiency for a long time is a prerequisite for rechargeable Na metal batteries to be practically useful despite their notable advantages in theoretical energy density and potential low cost. Their high chemical reactivity with the electrolyte and tendency for dendrite formation are two major issues limiting the reversibility of Na metal electrodes. In this work, we introduce for the first time potassium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (KTFSI) as a bifunctional electrolyte additive to stabilize Na metal electrodes, in which the TFSI− anions decompose into lithium nitride and oxynitrides to render a desirable solid electrolyte interphase layer while the K+ cations preferentially adsorb onto Na protrusions and provide electrostatic shielding to suppress dendritic deposition. Through the cooperation of the cations and anions, we have realized Na metal electrodes that can be deeply cycled at a capacity of 10 mAh cm−2 for hundreds of hours.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition

An Electrospun Nanofiber Membrane as Gel-Based Electrolyte for Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimWe report on the synthesis and characterization of an electrospun gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) membrane based on polyacrylonitrile nanofibers (PAN) swollen in a polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether/Na-salt electrolyte solution, for application in room temperature sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries. The membranes show a high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical stability window, and good thermal stability. We demonstrate the performance of the membrane in an Na–S cell using a sulfur–carbon nanotubes composite cathode and Na metal as anode. Our results show that the GPE membrane stabilizes the Na metal anode resulting in stable cycling behavior. The capacity of the Na–S cell, using the GPE membrane and operating at room temperature, is approximately 500 mAh g−1 over 40 cycles. The selected electrolyte configuration also provides improved safety by replacing the highly reactive sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) salt previously used in literature. All these benefits make the gel-polymer electrolyte membrane a very promising system for application in room-temperature sodium and sodium–sulfur batteries.",Energy Technology
Quantitative investigation of polysulfide adsorption capability of candidate materials for Li-S batteries,"© 2018Lithium-sulfur batteries have a high theoretical energy density of 2500 Wh/kg and are promising candidates for meeting future energy storage demands. However, dissolution of the intermediate polysulfide species into the electrolyte remains as a major challenge, causing fast capacity degradation in Li-S batteries. Many recent studies have reported various materials such as metal oxides and sulfides that interact strongly with polysulfide species and can alleviate the dissolution problem, though little work has focused on quantitative comparison of different materials under equivalent conditions. Here, we establish a standard procedure to quantitatively compare the polysulfide adsorption capability of candidate materials. We found that an order of magnitude of difference is evident between poor adsorption materials such as carbon black and strong adsorption materials such as V2O5 and MnO2. We elucidate different adsorption mechanisms may be present and probe possible adsorption species. We expect our work will provide a useful strategy to screen for suitable candidate materials and valuable information for rational design of long cycle life Li-S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
S-doped carbon@TiO2 to store Li+/Na+ with high capacity and long life-time,"© 2018Sodium-ion batteries as the possible replacements of lithium-ion batteries have drawn much attention recently. Although graphite have been the anodes of commercial lithium-ion batteries, it is difficult to reversibly intercalate Na+ of large diameter in graphite with high capacity. In this study, S-doped carbon@TiO2 core-shell composites are designed and prepared via a facile hydrothermal route. The composites as anodes showed high reversible capacities of 768 and 480 mAh g-1 (higher than the theoretical values of both graphite and TiO2) for Li+ and Na+ storage which can be ascribed to the surface storage due to the presence of sulfure atoms. It is discovered that the S-doping can greatly increase the binding energy of Na ion on graphite, and improve the possible formation of C4Na on the surface. In addition, TiO2 nanocoatings have a great effect on the storage stability of both Li+ and Na+ in the composites, resulting in the ultralong cycling life. The synergistic combination of S-doped carbon and TiO2 dense nanocoatings may provide new strategies for the investigation of supercapacitors and other related devices.",Energy Storage Materials
All-solid-state supercapacitors with superior compressive strength and volumetric capacitance,"© 2018Wide applications of compression-resistant electronics have promoted the demands for energy storage devices with high compressive strength. Herein, we fabricated highly dense graphene architectures (DGAs) embedded with solid electrolyte by evaporation-induced shrinkage of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hydrogels filled with phosphoric acid/polyvinyl alcohol (H3PO4/PVA) electrolyte solution. In such DGAs, rGO sheets remain a stacked structure and solid electrolyte is uniformly distributed throughout the DGAs, forming a good contact between rGO sheets and solid electrolyte by hydrogen bonding interactions. The DGAs exhibit a high weight density of 1.5 g cm−3, excellent modulus of 234 MPa and high conductivity of 13.5 S m−1. Furthermore, the all-solid-state supercapacitors based on DGAs achieved a superior volumetric capacitance of about 155 F cm−3 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. More importantly, the all-solid-state supercapacitors based on DGAs retain stable electrochemical properties under different compressive stresses.",Energy Storage Materials
Highly doped graphene with multi-dopants for high-capacity and ultrastable sodium-ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Heteroatom-doped graphene materials are one of the most promising electrode materials in energy-related realms. In this work, highly doped graphene nanosheets with tunable N and S codopants (NS-GNS) are prepared via a facile one-pot method and investigated in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). During the pyrolysis, the starting materials can form planar sacrificial-templates that serve for the growth of 2D graphene structure and further in-situ convert into rich N and S dopant species, successfully solving the general challenge of high doping level of multi-heteroatoms into the graphene matrix. Integrating the abundant N, S and O-induced electrochemical redox centers at different potentials, the NS-GNS electrode demonstrates a high reversible capacity of around 400 mAh g−1. Particularly, the ultra-long cycle life of 10,000 cycles and good rate capability of the present NS-GNS electrode make it promising for practical application in large-scale energy storage. This work guilds a direction toward redox-enhanced graphene materials with multi-dopants for energy storage and meanwhile provides a low-cost and scalable method for the mass production of well-defined graphene materials with tunable properties.",Energy Storage Materials
Oxygen Pressure Influences Spatial NaO2 Deposition and the Sudden Death Mechanism in Na-O2 Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Over the past decade, metal-O2 batteries have been intensely studied as potential high energy density alternatives to current state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries. Of these, nonaqueous Na-O2 batteries offer high stability, improved full-cycle efficiency, and lower overpotentials, particularly on charge, when compared to the higher-energy-density Li-O2 system. However, Na-O2 batteries exhibit sudden and large overpotential increases or ""sudden deaths"" on discharge, substantially limiting the achievable capacity. In this work, we examine the influence of O2 pressure effects in Na-O2 batteries and the mechanism of sudden death at different O2 pressures and current density regimes. We observe that at a given current density, there exists a transition between failure mechanisms with O2 pressure as a result of different phenomena related to the deposition of the solid discharge product, sodium superoxide (NaO2). Cells operated at a lower O2 pressure are more susceptible to failure due to surface passivation resulting from thin NaO2 film coverage, whereas cells operated at a higher O2 pressure achieve higher capacities but are increasingly subject to failure due to pore clogging from substantial solid NaO2 deposition. We associate the transition between these failure mechanisms with a combination of electron and mass transfer effects, leading to dramatic differences in the spatial deposition of NaO2 through the cathode.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Scalable Synthesis of Alkali Sulfide Nanocrystals Using a Bubble Column Reactor,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Alkali sulfide nanocrystals (Li2S and Na2S) are critical materials used to make solid-state electrolytes and cathodes for advanced battery technologies. We have recently developed a green chemistry for the synthesis of these materials through reactive precipitation by contacting organic solutions with hydrogen sulfide at ambient temperature. In this work, the use of bubble columns was developed as a platform for scalable manufacturing of these nanomaterials. Initial attempts to reproduce the batch reactor synthesis were complicated by nanoparticles clogging the sparger. This was resolved through the introduction of an inert column of fluid between the sparger and the solution. Using this 4-phase bubble column, anhydrous, phase-pure Li2S and Na2S nanocrystals were synthesized across the full range of conditions explored. X-ray characterization showed that the primary crystallite size was 20-40 nm, assembling into aggregates of hundreds of nanometers in size. This work validates the potential of bubble columns for large-scale manufacturing of nanocrystals by reactive precipitation in gas-liquid systems.",Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research
Facile Stabilization of the Sodium Metal Anode with Additives: Unexpected Key Role of Sodium Polysulfide and Adverse Effect of Sodium Nitrate,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium metal is an attractive anode for next-generation energy storage systems owing to its high specific capacity, low cost, and high abundance. Nevertheless, uncontrolled Na dendrite growth caused by the formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) leads to poor cycling performance and severe safety concerns. Sodium polysulfide (Na2S6) alone is revealed to serve as a positive additive or pre-passivation agent in ether electrolyte to improve the long-term stability and reversibility of the Na anode, while Na2S6-NaNO3 as co-additive has an adverse effect, contrary to the prior findings in the lithium anode system. A superior cycling behavior of Na anode is first demonstrated at a current density up to 10 mA cm−2 and a capacity up to 5 mAh cm−2 over 100 cycles. As a proof of concept, a high-capacity Na-S battery was prepared by pre-passivating the Na anode with Na2S6. This study gives insights into understanding the differences between Li and Na systems.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
3D Wettable Framework for Dendrite-Free Alkali Metal Anodes,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe infinite volume change and dendritic behavior in alkali metal anodes lead to low Coulombic efficiency and short-circuit issues that significantly hamper renewed efforts at commercialization. Here, a dendrite-free alkali metal anode, made by thermally preloading molten Li or Na into a 3D framework with high alkali wettability, is reported. In the mechanically robust 3D framework, carbon fiber (CF) serves as an electrical highway that provides fast charge transfer for the redox reaction. Through a facile solution-based process, a SnO2 coating is introduced to modify the poor wetting behavior of the carbon framework and drastically improve both the electrochemical performance and reliability. The kinetic barrier to adhesion of molten alkali metals on the CF framework is eliminated by the mixed reaction with SnO2. The growth of dendrites is effectively repressed under the decreased local current density of the 3D framework. In full-cell configurations with LiFePO4 cathodes, the Li–CF electrode shows reduced polarization and 90% capacity retention after 500 cycles in traditional carbonate electrolyte. Comparable improvements are also observed in 3D electrodes for Na metal batteries. These findings on a stable 3D carbon framework with improved wetting behavior provide significant practical implications for achieving safe and commercially viable alkali metal anodes.",Advanced Energy Materials
An Ultrafast Rechargeable Hybrid Sodium-Based Dual-Ion Capacitor Based on Hard Carbon Cathodes,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimHybrid sodium-based dual-ion capacitors (NDICs), which integrate the advantages of supercapacitors and sodium-ion batteries, have attracted tremendous attention recently. In this work, hybrid sodium-based dual-ion capacitors are successfully developed with nitrogen-doped microporous hard carbon as the cathode and soft carbon as the anode. N-doping is beneficial to the functional groups, porous structure, and electric conductivity of hard carbon. Hybrid NDICs possess a wide voltage range (0.01–4.7 V), high-energy density of 245.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1626 W kg−1, long cycle life (1000 cycles), and outstanding rate performance.",Advanced Energy Materials
Nanocrystalline Pyrite for Photovoltaic Applications,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimTransition metal sulfides (TMSs) are of special interest in energy conversion and storage devices. Amongst all sulfides, fool's gold or iron pyrite (FeS2) is potentially an attractive candidate for photovoltaic applications. Iron pyrite has risen to prominence due to its distinct properties and abundance in nature to meet the large scale needs. It is considered as environmentally benign solar absorber material with high absorption coefficient, α > 6 x105 cm−1 for λ ≥ 700 nm and suitable energy bandgap (Eg=0.95 eV). Numerous physical and chemical methods have been employed to deposit nanocrystalline pyrite thin films directly from source materials or indirectly by sulfuration. This review gives an overview of pyrite as a low cost photovoltaic absorber material for contemporary solar cell structures. In addition, practical approaches like the rational design of nanocomposites, band gap engineering and nanostructure synthesis of pyrite for improving its properties particularly photovoltaic properties are also deliberated. Moreover, limitations, challenges, remedies and prospects of pyrite as potential photovoltaic material are also reviewed to further advance the development of pyrite-based solar cell configurations.",ChemistrySelect
Self-Assembling Hollow Carbon Nanobeads into Double-Shell Microspheres as a Hierarchical Sulfur Host for Sustainable Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.We report the use of passion fruit-like double-carbon-shell porous carbon microspheres (PCMs) as the sulfur substrate in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. The PCMs are covered by microsized carbon shells on the outside and consisted of carbon nanobeads with hollow structure inside, leading to a unique multidimensional scaling double-carbon-shell structure with high electronic conductivity and strengthened mechanical properties. Sulfur is filled inside the PCMs (PCMs-S) and protected by the unique double-carbon-shell, which means the subsequently generated intermediate sodium polysulfide species cannot be exposed to the electrolyte directly and well protected inside. In addition, the inner interconnected porous structure provides room for the volume expansion of sulfur during discharge processes. It is found that the PCMs-S with a 63.6% initial Coulombic efficiency contributed to the 290 mA h g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1 after 350 cycles. More importantly, PCMs-S exhibited good rate performance with a capacity of 113 and 56 mA h g-1 at the current densities of 1000 and 2000 mA g-1, respectively.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Vulcanized polymeric cathode material featuring a polyaniline skeleton for high-rate rechargeability and long-cycle stability lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdA novel vulcanized polymeric cathode (S@h-P) is prepared by an inexpensive, simple heat treatment of polyaniline with sulfur particles for lithium–sulfur batteries. Conventional lithium–sulfur batteries easily dissolve free polysulfides, which causes a long-term stability issue; therefore, modified separators and polysulfide absorbents are necessary. In this work, sulfur atoms form covalent bonds with aromatic rings of the polyaniline backbone, and so no free polysulfides from the novel cathode exist, as confirmed by XRD and DSC. From CV analysis, the S@h-P only exhibits lower-order polysulfide on the polymer backbone, which affects the charge-discharge profile during the cell test. S@h-P exhibits a satisfactory cyclic stability of 88% capacity retention after 200 cycles, and it offers the excellent rate performance of 55% capacity preservation at the current density of 10 A g−1 compared to 0.1 A g−1. Most interestingly, this polymeric cathode can function in a carbonated system, whereas conventional lithium–sulfur batteries can not. Accordingly, the novel S@h-P cathode can be employed to fabricate ultra-stable and high-performance lithium–sulfur batteries for practical application.",Electrochimica Acta
Metal-organic complex derived hierarchical porous carbon as host matrix for rechargeable Na-Se batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe low Se loading, volumetric expansion and polyselenide shuttling between cathode and anode are major factors to limit the further development of Na-Se batteries. To overcome above issues, metal-organic complex derived hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) was synthesized as host matrix for Se via a facile synthesis combined with annealing treatment. The unique hollow structure holds numerous micropores and mesopores for Se loading to form Se-HPC composite. The Se-HPC electrode shows outstanding rate capabilities of 330 and 260 mA h g-1 at 1 C and 5 C, respectively. It also exhibits a stable cycling performance for 1000 cycles at 2 C with a small capacity decay rate of 0.04% per cycle. Such good performance demonstrates the viability of Na-Se batteries with high Se loading of 56%, which may be attributed to the unique hollow structure of HPC with Se encapsulated within micropores and mesopores. This attractive structure not only promotes electrolyte infiltration and electron transfer but also provides additional buffer space to buffer volumetric expansion of Se and suppress polyselenides dissolution in carbonate electrolyte during cycling.",Electrochimica Acta
Improving Photocatalytic Water Treatment through Nanocrystal Engineering: Mesoporous Nanosheet-Assembled 3D BiOCl Hierarchical Nanostructures That Induce Unprecedented Large Vacancies,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Vacancy control can significantly enhance the performance of photocatalytic semiconductors for water purification. However, little is known about the mechanisms and approaches that could generate stable large vacancies. Here, we report a new mechanism to induce vacancy formation on nanocrystals for enhanced photocatalytic activity: the introduction of mesopores. We synthesized two nanosheet-assembled hierarchical 3D BiOCl mesoporous nanostructures with similar morphology and exposed facets but different nanosheet thickness. Positron annihilation analysis detected unprecedentedly large VBi ″ VO •• VBi ″ VO •• VBi ″ vacancy associates (as well as VBi ″ VO •• VBi ″) on BiOCl assembled from 3-6 nm nanosheets but only VBi ″ VO •• VBi ″ vacancy associates on BiOCl assembled from thicker (10-20 nm) nanosheets. Comparison of vacancy properties with 2D ultrathin 2.7 nm nanosheets (with VBi ″ VO •• VBi ″ and VBi ″) indicates that nanosheet thinness alone cannot explain the formation of such large atom vacancies. On the basis of density functional theory computations of formation energy of isolated Bi vacancy, we show that mesopores facilitate the formation of large vacancies to counterbalance thermodynamic instability caused by incompletely coordinated Bi and O atoms along the mesopore perimeters. We corroborate that the extraordinarily large VBi ″VO •• VBi ″ VO •• VBi ″ vacancy associates facilitate photoexcitation of electrons and prevent the recombination of electron-hole pairs, which significantly enhances photocatalytic activity. This is demonstrated by the rapid mineralization of bisphenol A (10-5 M) with low photocatalyst loading (1 g L-1), as well as enhanced bacterial disinfection. Improved electron-hole separation is also corroborated by enhanced photocatalytic reduction of nitrate.",Environmental Science and Technology
Synthesis of hollow porous carbon microspheres and their application to room-temperature Na-S batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.A novel electrode material of room-temperature Na-S batteries was designed by hollow porous carbon microspheres (HPCM) derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which were used as a matrix to form HPCM/S composite by melt-infiltrating method. The electrochemical performance show that the HPCM/S composite as cathode delivered a reversible capacity over 617 mA h g−1 at 0.7C, maintaining over 311 mA h g−1 capacities after 60 cycles. The good electrochemical properties can be attributed to the hollow and porous structure of HPCM, which can host sulfur efficiently and alleviate the volume expansion caused by polysulfide.",Materials Letters
Solid-State Sodium Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRechargeable Na-ion batteries (NIBs) are attractive large-scale energy storage systems compared to Li-ion batteries due to the substantial reserve and low cost of sodium resources. The recent rapid development of NIBs will no doubt accelerate the commercialization process. As one of the indispensable components in current battery systems, organic liquid electrolytes are widely used for their high ionic conductivity and good wettability, but the low thermal stability, especially the easy flammability and leakage make them at risk of safety issues. The booming solid-state batteries with solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) show promise as alternatives to organic liquid systems due to their improved safety and higher energy density. However, several challenges including low ionic conductivity, poor wettability, low stability/incompatibility between electrodes and electrolytes, etc., may degrade performance, hindering the development of practical applications. In this review, an overview of Na-ion SSEs is first outlined according to the classification of solid polymer electrolytes, composite polymer electrolytes, inorganic solid electrolytes, etc. Furthermore, the current challenges and critical perspectives for the potential development of solid-state sodium batteries are discussed in detail.",Advanced Energy Materials
Sodium and Sodium-Ion Batteries: 50 Years of Research,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThis paper gives an overview of the research carried out on sodium batteries in the last 50 years. The discovery of the very high Na+ ion conductivity in β-Al2O3 opened the way to high-energy batteries (sodium/sulfur and sodium/NiCl2) for load leveling and electrical vehicles. Then, the liquid electrolyte batteries were considered with intercalation-based electrodes and lithium and sodium as mobile ions. When Sony proposed the lithium-ion batteries, most research moved to lithium systems, exhibiting a higher energy density. These are now currently used in electronic devices, hybrid electrical vehicle (HEV) and electrical vehicle (EV). The development of renewable energies, which have an intermittent character, requires very large batteries for frequency regulation and peak production shift. For these stationary applications the most important parameters are the lifetime, the power, the price, and the material availability. Since sodium ion batteries are able to satisfy these criteria, these new material families now concern a large part of the scientific community. This article gives a general introduction and an overview of the research carried out on the materials that are presented in detail, in the articles within this special issue on sodium batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials
Conversion-Based Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Sodium Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimConversion-based electrode materials for rechargeable sodium batteries (RSBs) have received considerable attention because of their potentially higher energy densities than those of conventional intercalation-based electrode materials. This would overcome generally lower energy densities of RSBs than those of lithium-ion batteries. However, they often suffer from large volume changes, sluggish Na-ion kinetics, and large overpotential in their reaction. Intensive research has thus focused on improving the electrochemical performance through a number of approaches, including analyses of the reaction mechanisms during charge/discharge, engineering the electrode materials in terms of their nanostructuring or compositing, and searching for new candidate materials. This review presents an overview of the approaches used to explore conversion electrode materials for RSBs, in particular focusing on those with relative high redox potential that could be possibly used as cathodes, followed by a discussion of the challenges and perspectives involving future research directions for these materials.",Advanced Energy Materials
Oxide-Based Composite Electrolytes Using Na3Zr2Si2PO12/Na3PS4 Interfacial Ion Transfer,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.All-solid-state sodium batteries using Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NASICON) solid electrolytes are promising candidates for safe and low-cost advanced rechargeable battery systems. Although NASICON electrolytes have intrinsically high sodium-ion conductivities, their high sintering temperatures interfere with the immediate development of high-performance batteries. In this work, sintering-free NASICON-based composites with Na3PS4 (NPS) glass ceramics were prepared to combine the high grain-bulk conductivity of NASICON and the interfacial formation ability of NPS. Before the composite preparation, the NASICON/NPS interfacial resistance was investigated by modeling the interface between the NASICON sintered ceramic and the NPS glass thin film. The interfacial ion-transfer resistance was very small above room temperature; the area-specific resistances at 25 and 100 °C were 15.8 and 0.40 ω cm2, respectively. On the basis of this smooth ion transfer, NASICON-rich (70-90 wt %) NASICON-NPS composite powders were prepared by ball-milling fine powders of each component. The composite powders were well-densified by pressing at room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy observation showed highly dispersed sub-micrometer NASICON grains in a dense NPS matrix to form closed interfaces between the oxide and sulfide solid electrolytes. The composite green (unfired) compacts with 70 and 80 wt % NASICON exhibited high total conductivities at 100 °C of 1.1 × 10-3 and 6.8 × 10-4 S cm-1, respectively. An all-solid-state Na15Sn4/TiS2 cell was constructed using the 70 wt % NASICON composite electrolyte by the uniaxial pressing of the powder materials, and its discharge properties were evaluated at 100 °C. The cell showed the reversible capacities of about 120 mAh g-1 under the current density of 640 μA cm-2. The prepared oxide-based composite electrolytes were thus successfully applied in all-solid-state sodium rechargeable batteries without sintering.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
High-Performance Na-O2 Batteries Enabled by Oriented NaO2 Nanowires as Discharge Products,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Na-O2 batteries are emerging rechargeable batteries due to their high theoretical energy density and abundant resources, but they suffer from sluggish kinetics due to the formation of large-size discharge products with cubic or irregular particle shapes. Here, we report the unique growth of discharge products of NaO2 nanowires inside Na-O2 batteries that significantly boosts the performance of Na-O2 batteries. For this purpose, a high-spin Co3O4 electrocatalyst was synthesized via the high-temperature oxidation of pure cobalt nanoparticles in an external magnetic field. The discharge products of NaO2 nanowires are 10-20 nm in diameter and ∼10 μm in length, characteristics that provide facile pathways for electron and ion transfer. With these nanowires, Na-O2 batteries have surpassed 400 cycles with a fixed capacity of 1000 mA h g-1, an ultra-low over-potential of ∼60 mV during charging, and near-zero over-potential during discharging. This strategy not only provides a unique way to control the morphology of discharge products to achieve high-performance Na-O2 batteries but also opens up the opportunity to explore growing nanowires in novel conditions.",Nano Letters
A pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile/selenium disulfide composite cathode with remarkable lithium and sodium storage performances,"Copyright © 2018 The Authors.As a special class of cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries, pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile/sulfur (pPAN/S) can completely solve the polysulfide dissolution problem and deliver reliable performance. However, the applicable S contents of pPAN/S are usually lower than 50 weight % (wt %), and their capacity utilizations are not sufficient, both of which greatly limit their energy densities for commercial applications. We report a pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile/selenium disulfide (pPAN/SeS2) composite with dramatically enhanced active material content (63 wt %) and superior performances for both lithium and sodium storage. As a result, pPAN/SeS2 delivers high capacity of >1100 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 for Li storage with extremely stable cycle life over 2000 cycles at 4.0 A g−1. Moreover, when applied in a room temperature Na-SeS2 battery, pPAN/SeS2 achieves superior capacity of >900 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and delivers prolonged cycle life over 400 cycles at 1.0 A g−1.",Science Advances
A Dual-Stimuli-Responsive Sodium-Bromine Battery with Ultrahigh Energy Density,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimStimuli-responsive energy storage devices have emerged for the fast-growing popularity of intelligent electronics. However, all previously reported stimuli-responsive energy storage devices have rather low energy densities (<250 Wh kg–1) and single stimuli-response, which seriously limit their application scopes in intelligent electronics. Herein, a dual-stimuli-responsive sodium-bromine (Na//Br2) battery featuring ultrahigh energy density, electrochromic effect, and fast thermal response is demonstrated. Remarkably, the fabricated Na//Br2 battery exhibits a large operating voltage of 3.3 V and an energy density up to 760 Wh kg−1, which outperforms those for the state-of-the-art stimuli-responsive electrochemical energy storage devices. This work offers a promising approach for designing multi-stimuli-responsive and high-energy rechargeable batteries without sacrificing the electrochemical performance.",Advanced Materials
Graphite as Cointercalation Electrode for Sodium-Ion Batteries: Electrode Dynamics and the Missing Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI),"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe intercalation of solvated sodium ions into graphite from ether electrolytes was recently discovered to be a surprisingly reversible process. The mechanisms of this “cointercalation reaction” are poorly understood and commonly accepted design criteria for graphite intercalation electrodes do not seem to apply. The excellent reversibility despite the large volume expansion, the small polarization and the puzzling role of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are particularly striking. Here, in situ electrochemical dilatometry, online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS), a variety of other methods among scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as theory to advance the understanding of this peculiar electrode reaction are used. The electrode periodically “breathes” by about 70–100% during cycling yet excellent reversibility is maintained. This is because the graphite particles exfoliate to crystalline platelets but do not delaminate. The speed at which the electrode breathes strongly depends on the state of discharge/charge. Below 0.5 V versus Na+/Na, the reaction behaves more pseudocapacitive than Faradaic. Despite the large volume changes, OEMS gas analysis shows that electrolyte decomposition is largely restricted to the first cycle only. Combined with TEM analysis and the electrochemical results, this suggests that the reaction is likely the first example of a SEI-free graphite anode.",Advanced Energy Materials
Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 Behaving as a Fast Ionic Conductor and Bridge to Boost the Electrochemical Performance of Li4Ti5O12,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) is a Li-ion conductive solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity; meanwhile, it also possesses relatively high electronic conductivity compared to those of the other fast ionic conductors. In this work, LATP was composited with Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) at a mass ratio of 0.026 and calcined at 700 °C for 5 h. The composite delivers reversible capacities of 164.8, 156.3, 152.4, 146.5, 130.5, and 158.6 mAh g-1 at the current densities of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, and 100 mA g-1, respectively, as well as a capacity of 112 mAh g-1 after cycling at 500 mA g-1 for 1200 cycles. The appreciable performance is attributable to the three-dimensional Li-ion diffusion channels in LATP to facilitate Li-ion migration, and the local charge imbalance resulted from the substitution of Al3+ for Ti4+ to promote charge transfer in LTO, thus the LATP-composited LTO exhibits enhanced ionic and electronic conductivities, as well as the markedly boosted electrochemical performance.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
Sulfur Hosts against the Shuttle Effect,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are considered as a substitute for conventional batteries as they are the most promising next-generation energy-storage system due to their high energy densities. However, their short cycling life, limited sulfur loading, severe polysulfide shuttling, and low sulfur utilization critically impede grid-level-storage energy techniques in Li–S batteries. The lithium shuttle effect results in rapid capacity fading and battery failure. The design and fabrication of sulfur hosts are key points to eliminate the aforementioned issues, especially the shuttle effect. In the past decade, spatial encapsulation and chemical interaction have improved the adsorption capacity of lithium polysulfides for the sulfur hosts and thus prolonged the lifetime of Li–S batteries. In an attempt to promote future research on the sulfur cathode and foster breakthroughs in Li–S batteries, recent achievements are highlighted, mechanical insights are discussed, and the remaining challenges and future research directions in the innovation of sulfur cathodes are identified.",Small Methods
Realizing a highly stable sodium battery with dendrite-free sodium metal composite anodes and O3-type cathodes,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdRoom-temperature Na metal batteries have been regarded as promising candidates for energy storage systems due to their high energy density and the widespread availability of low cost sodium. However, the practical application of metallic sodium anode is impeded by its low stripping/plating efficiency and poor cycling performance due to the poor reversibility of sodium anode caused by the formation of inhomogeneous solid electrolyte interphase, the growth of dendritic sodium, and relatively infinite volume change. Here, Na-C composite anode was fabricated by depositing nanoscale metallic sodium in graphitized carbon microspheres which were assembled from graphitized carbon nanosheets. The carbon microspheres function as a mini-nanoreservoir with high-surface-area, conductivity, and mechanical stability, which lower the local current density, ensure a homogeneous Na nucleation and high electrochemical active of Na, and restrict the volume change. As a result, metallic sodium can be reversibly nondendritic stripped/plated with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.3% up to 4 mA cm−2 for 4 mA h cm−2. Building upon this dendrite-free anode, we demonstrate a full cell using O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.2Ti0.3O2 cathode to achieve a superior long lifespan of ~100 cycles at high current density of 0.5 C.",Nano Energy
Flexible ultrathin all-solid-state supercapacitors,"© 2018, The Nonferrous Metals Society of China and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The flexible ultrathin all-solid-state supercapacitors with good electrochemical and mechanical performance were fabricated by the facile methods. The single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)–polyaniline (PANI) film electrodes and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/H3PO4 electrolyte film were prepared by spray-printing and spin-coating strategies, respectively. Thus, the thickness of a supercapacitor is only 8.4 μm. When the mass ratio of SWCNT to PANI is 1:1, the tensile strength and Young’s modulus of the electrode are 10.9 and 655 MPa, respectively. The interior contact resistance of the supercapacitors based on this electrode is only 15–30 Ω. Furthermore, the specific capacitance of this electrode can reach about 355.5 F·g−1, and the supercapacitor based on this electrode maintains 87.2% of its initial specific capacitance over 5000 charging/discharging cycles. Moreover, the supercapacitor shows an excellent electrochemical stability at different bending states. Therefore, the all-solid-state supercapacitors prepared by our strategies would meet the demands of wearable, lightweight, and compact energy storage devices.",Rare Metals
Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: State of the Art and Future Directions,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Sulfur remains in the spotlight as a future cathode candidate for the post-lithium-ion age. This is primarily due to its low cost and high discharge capacity, two critical requirements for any future cathode material that seeks to dominate the market of portable electronic devices, electric transportation, and electric-grid energy storage. However, before Li-S batteries replace lithium ion batteries, several technical challenges need to be solved. Among these challenges are polysulfide containment, the increase of sulfur loading (which must be ≥4-6 mg cm -2), the increase of sulfur fraction to ≥70%, the increase of sulfur utilization to ≥80%, the decrease of the electrolyte/sulfur weight ratio (which must be in the range of 3:1 or lower), and the stability of lithium anode material. Besides traditional carbon coating strategies, recent novel strategies addressing each of these challenges have been reported.

The State and Challenges of Anode Materials Based on Conversion Reactions for Sodium Storage,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have huge potential for applications in large-scale energy storage systems due to their low cost and abundant sources. It is essential to develop new electrode materials for SIBs with high performance in terms of energy density, cycle life, and cost.

Elucidation of the Sodium-Storage Mechanism in Hard Carbons,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimHard carbons (HCs) are the most promising candidate anode materials for emerging Na-ion batteries (NIBs). HCs are composed of misaligned graphene sheets with plentiful nanopores and defects, imparting a complex correlation between its structure and sodium-storage behavior. The currently debated mechanism of Na+-ion insertion in HCs hinders the development of high-performance NIBs. In this article, ingenious and reliable strategies are used to elaborate the correlation between the structure and electrochemical performance and further illuminate the sodium-storage mechanism in HCs. First, filling sulfur into the micropores of HCs can remove the low-voltage plateau, providing solid evidence for its association with the pore-filling mechanism. Along with the decreased concentration of defects/heteroatoms at higher treatment temperature, the reduced sloping capacity confirms the adsorption mechanism in the sloping region. Finally, the similar sodium-insertion behaviors of HCs with ether-based and ester-based electrolytes indicate that no Na+ ions intercalate between the graphene layers. The determined adsorption-pore-filling mechanism encourages the design of more efficient HC anode materials with high capacity for high-energy NIBs.",Advanced Energy Materials
3D Flexible Carbon Felt Host for Highly Stable Sodium Metal Anodes,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium (Na) metal, which possesses a high theoretical capacity and the lowest electrochemical potential, is regarded as a promising anode material for Na–metal batteries. However, both Na dendrite growth and large volume change in cycling have severely impeded its practical applications. This study demonstrates that a 3D flexible carbon (C) felt which is already commercialized in large-scale can be employed as a host for prestoring Na via a melt infusion strategy, through which a Na/C composite anode is obtained. The resulting anode exhibits a stable voltage profile and a small hysteresis over 120 cycles in carbonate-based electrolytes in symmetrical cells owing to the fact that the metallic Na is confined in a conductive carbon felt host, which increases the Na+ deposition sites to lower the effective current density and render a uniform Na nucleation, restricting the dimension change in electrochemical cycling. More importantly, effective inhibition of Na dendrite growth and large volume change is achieved. When coupled with a Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode, the Na/C composite demonstrates a good suitability in full cells. This work provides an alternative option for the fabrication of stable Na metal anodes, which is of great significance for the practical applications of Na metal anodes in high-energy-density batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials
A Host-Configured Lithium–Sulfur Cell Built on 3D Nickel Photonic Crystal with Superior Electrochemical Performances,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe insulator of the sulfur cathode and the easy dendrites growth of the lithium anode are the main barriers for lithium–sulfur cells in commercial application. Here, a 3D NPC@S/3D NPC@Li full cell is reported based on 3D hierarchical and continuously porous nickel photonic crystal (NPC) to solve the problems of sulfur cathode and lithium anode at the same time. In this case, the 3D NPC@S cathode can not only offer a fast transfer of electron and lithium ion, but also effectively prevent the dissolution of polysulfides and the tremendous volume change during cycling, and the 3D NPC@Li anode can efficiently inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites and volume expansion, too. As a result, the cell exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1383 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C (the current density of 837 mA g−1), superior rate ability (the reversible capacity of 735 mAh g−1 at the extremely high current density of 16 750 mA g−1) with excellent coulombic efficiency of about 100% and an excellent cycle life over 500 cycles with only about 0.026% capacity loss per cycle.",Small

After sulfur infusion, the S/MGC composite with 50.5 wt% sulfur loading exhibits superior long-term cycling stability and rate performance in S/MGC | Li full cell. The cell delivers high capacity of 1146 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and 570 mAh g−1 even at 4 C. Moreover, the capacities of 826 and 571 mAh g−1 remain after 1000 cycles at 1 C and 2 C, respectively. In addition, the cell exhibits good storage property. The well confined S2-4 inside the interconnected ultra-micropores with graphitic carbon walls endows the S/MGC composite with good electronic conductivity and stability, while un-occupied pores within the S/MGC facilitate fast Li+ transport and kinetics of electrochemical reactions.

Vapor phase sulfurization synthesis of interlayer-expanded MoS2@C hollow nanospheres as a robust anode material for lithium-ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.MoS2@C hollow nanospheres are synthesized by in situ vapor phase sulfurization of the spherical polypyrrole-polyoxometalate (PPy-PMo12) precursors, in which MoS2 layers with widened interlayer spacing of 0.98 nm and amorphous carbon are generated. The vapor phase sulfurization process can retain the spherical morphology of the PPy-PMo12 precursor, and facilitate the formation of the MoS2@C hollow structures. When used as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, the MoS2@C hollow nanospheres exhibit excellent lithium storage performances compared to the bulk MoS2, including high specific capacity (1225.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), excellent rate capability (452 mAh g−1 at 8 A g−1 and 389.6 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1), and good cycling stability (94.3% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1). The hollow structures of interlayer-expanded MoS2@C hollow nanospheres could provide more active sites and buffer the volume changes for the electrochemical reactions.

Offset Initial Sodium Loss to Improve Coulombic Efficiency and Stability of Sodium Dual-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Sodium dual-ion batteries (NDIBs) are attracting extensive attention recently because of their low cost and abundant sodium resources. However, the low capacity of the carbonaceous anode would reduce the energy density, and the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in the anode during the initial cycles will lead to large amount consumption of Na+ in the electrolyte, which results in low Coulombic efficiency and inferior stability of the NDIBs. To address these issues, a phosphorus-doped soft carbon (P-SC) anode combined with a presodiation process is developed to enhance the performance of the NDIBs. The phosphorus atom doping could enhance the electric conductivity and further improve the sodium storage property. On the other hand, an SEI could preform in the anode during the presodiation process; thus the anode has no need to consume large amounts of Na+ to form the SEI during the cycling of the NDIBs. Consequently, the NDIBs with P-SC anode after the presodiation process exhibit high Coulombic efficiency (over 90%) and long cycle stability (81 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 after 900 cycles with capacity retention of 81.8%), far more superior to the unsodiated NDIBs. This work may provide guidance for developing high performance NDIBs in the future.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Enhancing Capacity Performance by Utilizing the Redox Chemistry of the Electrolyte in a Dual-Electrolyte Sodium-Ion Battery,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimA strategy is described to increase charge storage in a dual electrolyte Na-ion battery (DESIB) by combining the redox chemistry of the electrolyte with a Na+ ion de-insertion/insertion cathode. Conventional electrolytes do not contribute to charge storage in battery systems, but redox-active electrolytes augment this property via charge transfer reactions at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The capacity of the cathode combined with that provided by the electrolyte redox reaction thus increases overall charge storage. An aqueous sodium hexacyanoferrate (Na4Fe(CN)6) solution is employed as the redox-active electrolyte (Na-FC) and sodium nickel Prussian blue (Nax-NiBP) as the Na+ ion insertion/de-insertion cathode. The capacity of DESIB with Na-FC electrolyte is twice that of a battery using a conventional (Na2SO4) electrolyte. The use of redox-active electrolytes in batteries of any kind is an efficient and scalable approach to develop advanced high-energy-density storage systems.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Dopant Effects of Gd3+ on the Electrochemical Pseudocapacitive Characteristics of Electroactive Mesoporous NiO Electrodes for Supercapacitors,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Undoped and gadolinium doped nanostructured mesoporous materials, such as NiO, Ni0.98Gd0.02O, Ni0.95Gd0.05O, and Ni0.92Gd0.08O, were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal route using urea as the hydrolysis controlling agent and were studied for supercapacitor applications. The thermal stability of the synthesized samples was identified by thermogravimetric analysis. The phase structure of the as-synthesized and calcined materials was characterized by using powder X-ray diffraction. The average crystallite size of the oxide materials was found to be in the range of 8.2-11.3 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed the metal-oxygen bond in the compounds. The analyzed morphological phenomenon of the prepared samples confirms the mesoporous flake-like shape. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were performed to examine the surface area and pore-size distribution. The elemental composition and charge states analyses were obtained by energy-dispersive X-ray and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurements were applied in an aqueous electrolyte to investigate the electrochemical performances of the active electrodes. Among the four electrodes, Ni0.98Gd0.02O exhibits the highest surface redox reactivity and shows optimum high specific capacitance of 1190 F/g at a current density of 2 A/g.

Here, we demonstrate a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)-based electrolyte with 1 M sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) salt for the stable and dense deposition of the Na metal during electrochemical cycling. The novel electrolyte combination developed here circumvents the dendritic Na deposition that is one of the primary concerns for battery safety and constructs the uniform ionic interlayer achieving highly reversible Na plating/stripping reactions.

Existence of Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Mg Batteries: Mg/S Chemistry as an Example,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Magnesium redox chemistry is a very appealing ""beyond Li ion chemistry"" for realizing high energy density batteries due to the high capacity, low reduction potential, and most importantly, highly reversible and dendrite-free Mg metal anode. However, the progress of rechargeable Mg batteries has been greatly hindered by shortage of electrolytes with wide stability window, high ionic conductivity, and good compatibility with cathode materials. Unlike solid electrolyte interphase on Li metal anode, surface film formed by electrolyte decomposition in Mg batteries was considered to block Mg ion transport and passivate Mg electrode. For this reason, the attention of the community has been mainly focusing on surface layer free electrolytes, while reductively unstable salts/solvents are barely considered, despite many of them possessing all the necessary properties for good electrolytes. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that the surface film formed by electrolyte decomposition can function as a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Using Mg/S chemistry as a model system, the SEI formation mechanism on Mg metal anode was thoroughly examined using electrochemical methods and surface chemistry characterization techniques such as EDX and XPS. On the basis of these results, a comprehensive view of the Mg/electrolyte interface that unifies both the SEI mechanism and the passivation layer mechanism is proposed. This new picture of surface layer on Mg metal anode in Mg batteries not only revolutionizes current understanding of Mg/electrolyte interface but also opens new avenues for electrolyte development by uncovering the potential of those reductively unstable candidates through interface design.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

A quaternary sodium superionic conductor - Na10.8Sn1.9PS11.8,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdSulfide-based Na-ion conductors are promising candidates as solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) for fabrication of solid-state Na-ion batteries (NIBs) because of their high ionic conductivities and low grain boundary resistance. Currently, most of the sulfide-based Na-ion conductors with high conductivities are focused on Na3PS4 phases and its derivatives. It is desirable to develop Na-ion conductors with new composition and crystal structure to achieve superior ionic conductivities. Here we report a new quaternary Na-ion conductor, Na10.8Sn1.9PS11.8, exhibiting a high ionic conductivity of 0.67 mS cm−1 at 25 °C. This high ionic conductivity originates from the presence of a large number of intrinsic Na-vacancies and three-dimensional Na-ion conduction pathways, which has been confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and first-principles calculations.

Solvothermal-Derived S-Doped Graphene as an Anode Material for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted enormous attention in recent years due to the high abundance and low cost of sodium. However, in contrast to lithium-ion batteries, conventional graphite is unsuitable for SIB anodes because it is much more difficult to intercolate the larger Na ions into graphite layers. Therefore, it is critical to develop new anode materials for SIBs for practical use. Here, heteroatom-doped graphene with high doping levels and disordered structures is prepared using a simple and economical thermal process. The solvothermal-derived graphene shows excellent performance as an anode material for SIBs. It exhibits a high reversible capacity of 380 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 100 mA g−1, excellent rate performance 217 mAh g−1 at 3200 mA g−1, and superior cycling performance at 2.0 A g−1 during 1000 cycles with negligible capacity fade.",Advanced Science
Beyond lithium ion batteries: Higher energy density battery systems based on lithium metal anodes,"© 2017Environmental pollution and energy shortage lead to a continuous demand for battery energy storage systems with a higher energy density.

Vertical graphene/Ti2Nb10O29/hydrogen molybdenum bronze composite arrays for enhanced lithium ion storage,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.The advancement of lithium ions batteries (LIBs) largely relies on the innovation of electrode materials with high power/energy densities, which are highly related to electrode structure and interface characteristics between electrolyte and electrode. In this work, for the first time, we realize the rational integration of titanium niobium oxide (Ti2Nb10O29, TNO) and vertical graphene (VG) into free-standing arrays with intimate core/shell structure. More excitingly, to make the above VG/TNO more perfect, hydrogen molybdenum bronze (HMB) is controllably introduced as a conductive shell to form the ultimate VG/TNO/HMB core/shell composite arrays (CSCAs). VG and HMB serve as powerful conductive “body guards” for TNO guest, both inside and out. With the enhanced conductivity and reinforced structural stability, the VG/TNO/HMB CSCAs are demonstrated with excellent lithium ion storage performance with higher capacities (317 mAh g−1 at 2 C, and 163 mAh g−1 at 60 C), and better cycling life and superior high-rate capability to VG/TNO counterpart.

Molecular insights into ether-based electrolytes for Li-FeS2 batteries,"© 2017Lithium-FeS2 is an attractive chemistry for rechargeable lithium batteries because of its high theoretical energy density ~1313 Wh kg−1. However, fast capacity fade is generally observed in this system due to the irreversible dissolution of active materials (polysulfide ions, Fe ion etc.) into the electrolyte. This work investigates the effect of ethereal electrolyte solvents’ structure on its solvating power of Li-polysulfides and eventually on the cycling stability of rechargeable Li-FeS2 cells. Methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), a high carbon/oxygen ratio ether, is studied and compared with the standard 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME):1,3-dioxolane (DOL) ether couple as electrolyte solvent for Li-FeS2 and similar chemistries. The higher level of non-polar character and the additional steric hindrance in MTBE both endow it with significantly lower solvating capability and lower solubility of Li-polysulfides than DME:DOL. This is predicted by quantum chemical calculation and verified by experiments. In electrochemical test, MTBE solvent helps to significantly improve the cycling stability of the Li-FeS2 cell. Post-cycling material analysis and impedance tests both indicate that this is due to the alleviated active material dissolution and re-deposition on the lithium anode. Similar improvement is also observed in the Li-CuS cell case. Although the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte is also affected by this new solvent and MBTE cannot yet be a satisfactory solution, our study presents important guidance in designing future electrolyte for Li-FeS2 battery.",Energy Storage Materials

High-Performance All-Solid-State Na-S Battery Enabled by Casting-Annealing Technology,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature all-solid-state Na-S batteries (ASNSBs) using sulfide solid electrolytes are a promising next-generation battery technology due to the high energy, enhanced safety, and earth abundant resources of both sodium and sulfur. Currently, the sulfide electrolyte ASNSBs are fabricated by a simple cold-pressing process leaving with high residential stress. Even worse, the large volume change of S/Na2S during charge/discharge cycles induces additional stress, seriously weakening the less-contacted interfaces among the solid electrolyte, active materials, and the electron conductive agent that are formed in the cold-pressing process. The high and continuous increase of the interface resistance hindered its practical application. Herein, we significantly reduce the interface resistance and eliminate the residential stress in Na2S cathodes by fabricating Na2S-Na3PS4-CMK-3 nanocomposites using melting-casting followed by stress-release annealing-precipitation process. The casting-annealing process guarantees the close contact between the Na3PS4 solid electrolyte and the CMK-3 mesoporous carbon in mixed ionic/electronic conductive matrix, while the in situ precipitated Na2S active species from the solid electrolyte during the annealing process guarantees the interfacial contact among these three subcomponents without residential stress, which greatly reduces the interfacial resistance and enhances the electrochemical performance. The in situ synthesized Na2S-Na3PS4-CMK-3 composite cathode delivers a stable and highly reversible capacity of 810 mAh/g at 50 mA/g for 50 cycles at 60 °C. The present casting-annealing strategy should provide opportunities for the advancement of mechanically robust and high-performance next-generation ASNSBs.",ACS Nano
Recent Progress of the Solid-State Electrolytes for High-Energy Metal-Based Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSecondary batteries based on metal anodes (e.g., Li, Na, Mg, Zn, and Al) are among the most sought-after candidates for next-generation mobile and stationary storage systems because they are able to store a larger amount of energy per unit mass or volume. However, unstable electrodeposition and uncontrolled interfacial reactions occuring in liquid electrolytes cause unsatisfying cell performance and potential safety concerns for the commercial application of these metal anodes. Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) having a higher modulus are considered capable of inhibiting difficulties associated with the anodes and may enable building of safe all-solid-state metal batteries, yet several challenges, such as insufficient room-temperature ionic conductivity and poor interfacial stability between the electrode and the electrolyte, hinder the large-scale development of such batteries. Here, research and development of SSEs including inorganic ceramics, organic solid polymers, and organic–inorganic hybrid/composite materials for metal-based batteries are reviewed.

Stabilizing a High-Energy-Density Rechargeable Sodium Battery with a Solid Electrolyte,"© 2018 Elsevier Inc.The cycling performance at 60°C of a Na2MnFe(CN)6/Na cell with a ceramic solid electrolyte is compared with that of a cell with an organic-liquid electrolyte operating at room temperature. Analysis of the electrode-electrolyte interfaces after charge-discharge cycling showed that a sodium-metal anode that wets the solid electrolyte can be plated and stripped reversibly dendrite free and that the dissolution of the cyano-perovskite Na2MnFe(CN)6 cathode that occurs with an organic-liquid electrolyte is eliminated with the utilization of the solid electrolyte. This demonstration indicates that a high-energy-density and low-cost sodium rechargeable battery can be competitive for large-scale electric energy storage where both the anode and cathode problems are solved in an all-solid-state battery. The dependence of modern society on the combustion of fossil fuels is not sustainable. Solar and wind energy can be harvested and converted to electric power that can be transported to stationary sites for storage. Storage of electric power in a rechargeable battery would be the best solution, and a battery with a metallic-sodium anode and a cyano-perovskite Na2MnFe(CN)6 cathode would offer low-cost storage of electric power provided that its cycle life can be greatly improved. We demonstrate that this improvement is possible if a solid Na+ electrolyte can replace the organic-liquid electrolyte into which the Na2MnFe(CN)6 cathode dissolves over repeated charge-discharge cycling, and dendrite-free plating of a sodium-metal anode provides low impedance. Dissolution of the Na2MnFe(CN)6 cathode and the growth of sodium dendrites are eliminated in an all-solid-state sodium battery with a ceramic solid electrolyte contacting the sodium-metal anode and the Na2MnFe(CN)6 cathode.",Chem
Double-Confined Sulfur Inside Compressed Nickel Foam and Pencil-Plating Graphite for Lithium-Sulfur Battery,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.The sulfur confined inside the interpenetrating network of compressed nickel foam we prepared and its application as a high-performance S cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries was investigated. The double confine by Ni foam and pencil-plating graphite makes the cathode high performance. The mechanical physical method was applied to prepare the S cathode at room temperature without using binder and conductive additives. The sulfur mass loading was controlled between 0.42 and 3.32 mg/cm2 in the cathode piece. The optimized cathode of 0.42 mg/cm2 S on Ni foam displayed high initial discharge capacity (1412 mAh/g at 1C), long cycle stability (1014 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 1C, S 1.05 mg/m2), and high rate capability (495 mAh/g at 2C, S 1.15 mg/cm2). This rapid, simple, one-step cathode preparation method may pave a new practical way for mass production of high-performances S cathode materials in lithium-sulfur battery technology.",Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research
Cobalt-Doped Vanadium Nitride Yolk-Shell Nanospheres @ Carbon with Physical and Chemical Synergistic Effects for Advanced Li-S Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery has been attracting increasing attention because of its high energy density and the presence of abundance of sulfur. However, its commercialization is still restricted owing to the low conductivity of sulfur, large volume expansion, and a severe polysulfide-shuttle effect. To address these problems, here, we have reported for the first time a simple template-free solvothermal method combined with a subsequent calcination method to prepare cobalt-doped vanadium nitride (VN) yolk-shell nanospheres, encapsulated in a thin layer of a nitrogen-doped carbon (Co-VN@C) composite as an ideal sulfur host. Benefiting from the unique structural advantages and the synergistic effect of conductive VN, cobalt, and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC), the obtained composite could not only facilitate the kinetics of polysulfide conversion as a functional catalyst but also physically confine and chemically absorb the polysulfides effectively. With these advantages, the batteries present a high initial discharge capacity of 1379.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (1 C is defined as 1675 mA g-1), good rate performance, and excellent cycling performances (∼715 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C after 200 cycles and ∼600 mAh g-1 at 1 C after 300 cycles, respectively), even with a high areal sulfur loading of 4.07 mg cm-2 (∼830 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C after 100 cycles). These results demonstrate that the rationally designed multifunctional sulfur host material Co-VN@C has great potential for application in Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
"Formation Dynamics of Potassium-Based Graphite Intercalation Compounds: An Ab Initio Study FORMATION DYNAMICS of POTASSIUM-BASED ... XIANKAI JIANG, BO SONG, and DAVID TOMÁNEK","© 2018 American Physical Society.This paper is a contribution to the Physical Review Applied collection in memory of Mildred S. Dresselhaus.We use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study the microscopic dynamics of potassium intercalation in graphite. Upon adsorbing on graphite from the vapor phase, K atoms transfer their valence charge to the substrate. K atoms adsorbed on the surface diffuse rapidly along the graphene basal plane and eventually enter the interlayer region following a ""U-turn"" across the edge, gaining additional energy. This process is promoted at higher coverages associated with higher K pressure, leading to the formation of a stable intercalation compound. We find that the functionalization of graphene edges is an essential prerequisite for intercalation since bare edges reconstruct and reconnect, closing off the entry channels for the atoms.",Physical Review Applied
Facile synthesis of pyrite (FeS2/C) nanoparticles as an electrode material for non-aqueous hybrid electrochemical capacitors,"©2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Pyrite (FeS2) is a promising electrode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) because of its high natural availability, low toxicity, cost-effectiveness, high theoretical capacity (894 mA h g-1) and high theoretical specific energy density (1270 W h kg-1, 4e-/FeS2). Nevertheless, the use of FeS2 in electrochemical capacitors was restricted due to fast capacity fading as a result of polysulfide (S/Sn2-) formation during the initial electrochemical cycling. In order to avoid the formation of polysulfides, we employed the strategy of utilizing an ether based electrolyte (1.0 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)/diglyme (DGM)). Herein, we introduce FeS2/C as the Faradaic electrode for a non-aqueous hybrid electrochemical capacitor (NHEC) in combination with activated carbon (AC) as a non-Faradaic electrode, and 1.0 M LiTFSI/DGM as a non-aqueous electrolyte. Specifically, FeS2/C nanoparticles have been prepared via the sulfidation of a room temperature synthesized Fe-based MOF (metal organic framework) precursor. The fabricated FeS2/C∥AC NHEC, operating within the chosen voltage window of 0-3.2 V, delivered energy densities in the range of 63-9 W h kg-1 at power densities of 152-3240 W kg-1. Remarkable cycling stability with stable energy density retention for 2500 cycles at high power densities (729, 1186 and 3240 W kg-1) was observed.",Nanoscale
A High-Capacity Lithium-Gas Battery Based on Sulfur Fluoride Conversion,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Identification of novel redox reactions that combine the prospects of high potential and capacity can contribute new opportunities in the development of advanced batteries with significantly higher energy density than today's state-of-the-art, while advancing current understanding of nonaqueous electrochemical transformations and reaction mechanisms. The immense research efforts directed in recent years toward metal-gas, and in particular lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries, have highlighted the role that gas-to-solid conversion reactions can play in future energy technologies; however, efforts have mainly focused on tailoring the anode (alkali metal) in the metal-gas couple to achieve improved reversibility. Here, in a different approach, we introduce and characterize a new gas cathode reaction that capitalizes on the full change in the oxidation state (from +6 to -2) available in redox-active sulfur, based on the cathodic reduction of highly fluorinated sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) in a Li metal battery. In a glyme-based electrolyte (0.3 M LiClO4 in tetra ethylene glycol dimethyl ether), we establish, using quantitative gas and 19F NMR analysis, that discharge predominantly involves an 8-electron reduction of SF6, yielding stoichiometric LiF, as well as Li2S and modest amounts of higher-order Li polysulfides. This multiphase conversion reaction yields capacities of ∼3600 mA h gC-1 at moderate rates (30 mA gC-1) and potentials up to 2.2 V versus Li/Li+. In a nonglyme electrolyte, 0.3 M LiClO4 in dimethyl sulfoxide, SF6 reduction also proceeds readily, yielding higher capacities of ∼7800 mA h gC-1 at 30 mA gC-1. Although not at present rechargeable, the demonstration of, and insights gained, from the primary Li-SF6 system provides a promising first step for design of novel sulfur conversion chemistries with energy densities that exceed those of today's Li primary batteries, while demonstrating a new design space for nonaqueous gas-to-solid electrochemical reactions.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
"Sodium ionic conductivity and stability of amorphous Na2O·2SiO2 added with MxOy (M = Zr, Y, and Sm)","© 2018 Elsevier LtdAmorphous Na2O·2SiO2 (A-Na2O·2SiO2) is one of the promising sodium ionic conductors for solid-state sodium-ion battery electrolytes owing to its easy preparation and low production cost. However, Na2O·2SiO2 glass suffers from relatively low conductivity and poor thermal stability as a result of crystallization and other defects. Herein, we improved the ionic conductivity and thermal stability of A-Na2O·2SiO2 by adding this material with metal oxides (MxOy, M = Y, Sm, and Zr) at varying loadings. The physical properties and stability of the A-Na2O·2SiO2 added with different oxides were systematically investigated. The results indicated that oxide adding on A-Na2O·2SiO2 resulted in larger density values that increased with the adding content. Additionally, oxide adding changed the strength of the Si–O bond in A-Na2O·2SiO2, thereby affecting the overall network structure and uniformity. Among the different oxides prepared, added with 3 mol% Sm2O3, 3 mol% Y2O3, and 2 mol% ZrO2 showed maximum hardness and elasticity modulus values. Additionally, oxide adding on A-Na2O·2SiO2 resulted in significantly improved ionic conductivity values. 3 mol% Y2O3-added A-Na2O·2SiO2 material showed the highest ionic conductivity value (5.2 × 10−3 S cm−1) and optimum thermal stability, indicating that Y2O3-added Na2O·2SiO2 has high potential to be high-performance and stable sodium ionic conductors.",Materials and Design
Sodium-Ion Batteries: Building Effective Layered Cathode Materials with Long-Term Cycling by Modifying the Surface via Sodium Phosphate,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSurface stabilization of cathode materials is urgent for guaranteeing long-term cyclability, and is important in Na cells where a corrosive Na-based electrolyte is used. The surface of P2-type layered Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 is modified with ionic, conducting sodium phosphate (NaPO3) nanolayers, ≈10 nm in thickness, via melt-impregnation at 300 °C; the nanolayers are autogenously formed from the reaction of NH4H2PO4 with surface sodium residues. Although the material suffers from a large anisotropic change in the c-axis due to transformation from the P2 to O2 phase above 4 V versus Na+/Na, the NaPO3-coated Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2/hard carbon full cell exhibits excellent capacity retention for 300 cycles, with 73% retention. The surface NaPO3 nanolayers positively impact the cell performance by scavenging HF and H2O in the electrolyte, leading to less formation of byproducts on the surface of the cathodes, which lowers the cell resistance, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy. Time-resolved in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction study reveals that the NaPO3 coating layer is delayed for decomposition to Mn3O4, thereby suppressing oxygen release in the highly desodiated state, enabling delay of exothermic decomposition. The findings presented herein are applicable to the development of high-voltage cathode materials for sodium batteries.",Advanced Functional Materials
Achieving a stable Na metal anode with a 3D carbon fibre scaffold,"© the Partner Organisations 2018.Na metal is considered as one of the most promising anode materials for Na batteries due to its low cost, high theoretical specific capacity and low electrochemical potential. However, Na metal anode has poor reversibility and thereare safety issues of dendritic growth of Na, which hinder its further application. In this study, we demonstrate that carbon fibre paper (CFP), as the 3D current collector, suppresses the growth of dendrite and improves the coulombic efficiency and the voltage hysteresis during long-term cycling due to the good Na affinity with carbon and the 3D conductive scaffold structure. Moreover, full battery is assembled with a Prussian blue cathode and CFP@Na anode. The superior performance of CFP@Na makes it a promising candidate for practical applications.",Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers
Fast ion transport at solid-solid interfaces in hybrid battery anodes,"© 2018 The Author(s).Carefully designed solid-electrolyte interphases are required for stable, reversible and efficient electrochemical energy storage in batteries. We report that hybrid battery anodes created by depositing an electrochemically active metal (for example, Sn, In or Si) on a reactive alkali metal electrode by a facile ion-exchange chemistry lead to very high exchange currents and stable long-term performance of electrochemical cells based on Li and Na electrodes. By means of direct visualization and ex situ electrodeposition studies, Sn-Li anodes are shown to be stable at 3 mA cm-2 and 3 mAh cm-2. Prototype full cells in which the hybrid anodes are paired with high-loading LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2(NCA) cathodes are also reported. As a second demonstration, we create and study Sn-Na hybrid anodes and show that they can be cycled stably for more than 1,700 hours with minimal voltage divergence. Charge storage at the hybrid anodes is reported to involve a combination of alloying and electrodeposition reactions.",Nature Energy
"High-rate FeS2/CNT neural network nanostructure composite anodes for stable, high-capacity sodium-ion batteries","© 2018 Elsevier LtdWe report a simple one-pot solvothermal method of a FeS2/CNT (carbon nanotube) neural network nanostructure composite (FeS2/CNT-NN) that exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance as a sodium-ion battery anode. In these composites, uniform microspheres assembled from FeS2 nanoparticles act as “somas” and CNTs act as “neurites”. The weight ratio of FeS2 to CNTs affects not only the composite morphology, but also the sodium-ion storage performance. By optimizing this ratio, we achieve stable capacities up to 394 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 200 mA g−1. Most impressively, when the current densities are increased, excellent capacity and stability are maintained. At 1 A g−1 to 22 A g−1, surprisingly high capacities of 309 mA h g−1 to 254 mA h g−1 are maintained after 1800 cycles and 8400 cycles, respectively. The excellent electrochemical performance has been found to originate from the unique neural network structure, which offers high surface area and small FeS2 particle size for sufficient sodiation and desodiation, and enough room and mechanical integrity for volume expansion. Pseudocapacitance has also been found to dominate in the redox reactions, accounting for the outstanding rate and cycling performance. The excellent charge-discharge performance shows that FeS2/CNT-NN composites are promising candidates for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries.",Nano Energy
Structure-property relationships at Nafion thin-film interfaces: Thickness effects on hydration and anisotropic ion transport,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe effect of film thickness on water uptake and structure in ultra-thin Nafion is probed via in situ neutron reflectometry for a series of 10 films with thicknesses ranging from 5 to 153 nm. Observed interfacial lamellae are used to understand anomalous transport limitations in such films. Results show three distinct thickness regimes: (i) in the truncated regime (< 12 nm), the entire film consists of lamellae; (ii) in the thin-film regime (12–42 nm), a non-lamellar bulk-like layer forms between the lamellae and vapor; (iii) in the thick-film regime (≥ 60 nm), the bulk-like layer thickness exceeds the radius of gyration for thin-film Nafion. The water uptake in the sample varies non-monotonically with thickness, and can be ordered as: thin-film < truncated < thick-film. In the thin-film regime, the water uptake in the bulk-like layer and lamellae are equal, and both increase with thickness, except for a well-hydrated layer adjacent to the SiO2 substrate. In the thick-film regime, the bulk-like layer water uptake equals that in macroscopic Nafion membranes, and is invariant with film thickness, while the lamellar water uptake greatly exceeds this. Composition depth profiles are used to predict the anisotropic ionic conductivities. These are fitted to previously published experimental results to demonstrate that the lamellar structure is required for accurate conductivity predictions. These results provide key insights for minimizing transport losses in fuel cell catalyst layers.",Nano Energy
Mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets anchored on graphene for ultra long life Na-ion batteries,"© 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.Sodium-ion batteries, which have a similar electrochemical reaction mechanism to lithium-ion batteries, have been considered as one of the most potential lithium-ion battery alternatives due to the rich reserves of sodium. However, it is very hard to find appropriate electrode materials imputing the large radius of sodium-ion. TiO2 is particularly interesting as anodes for sodium-ion batteries due to their reasonable operation voltage, cost, and nontoxicity. To obtain a better electrochemical property, mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets (NSs)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites have been synthesized via a scalable hydrothermal-solvothermal method with a subsequent calcination process. Benefitting from unique structure design, TiO2 NSs@rGO exhibits a superior cycle stability (90 mAh g-1 after 10 000 cycles at a high current rate of 20 C) and satisfactory rate performance (97.3 mAh g-1 at 25 C). To our knowledge, such ultra long cycle life has not previously been reported.",Nanotechnology
New Insights into the Interphase between the Na Metal Anode and Sulfide Solid-State Electrolytes: A Joint Experimental and Computational Study,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.In this work, we investigated the interface between the sodium anode and the sulfide-based solid electrolytes Na3SbS4 (NAS), Na3PS4 (NPS), and Cl-doped NPS (NPSC) in all-solid-state-batteries (ASSBs). Even though these electrolytes have demonstrated high ionic conductivities in the range of 1 mS cm-1 at ambient temperatures, sulfide sold-state electrolytes (SSEs) are known to be unstable with Na metal, though the exact reaction mechanism and kinetics of the reaction remain unclear. We demonstrate that the primary cause of capacity fade and cell failure is a chemical reaction spurred on by electrochemical cycling that takes place at the interface between the Na anode and the SSEs. To investigate the properties of the Na-solid electrolyte interphase (SSEI) and its effect on cell performance, the SSEI was predicted computationally to be composed of Na2S and Na3Sb for NAS and identified experimentally via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These two compounds give the SSEI mixed ionic- and electronic-conducting properties, which promotes continued SSEI growth, which increases the cell impedance at the expense of cell performance and cycle life. The SSEI for NPS was similarly found to be comprised of Na2S and Na3P, but XPS analysis of Cl-doped NPS (NPSC) showed the presence of an additional compound at the SSEI, NaCl, which was found to mitigate the decomposition of NPS. The methodologies presented in this work can be used to predict and optimize the electrochemical behavior of an all-solid-state cell. Such joint computational and experimental efforts can inform strategies for engineering a stable electrolyte and SSEI to avoid such reactions. Through this work, we call for more emphasis on SSE compatibility with both anodes and cathodes, essential for improving the electrochemical properties, longevity, and practicality of Na-based ASSBs.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Core-Shell Fe1- xS@Na2.9PS3.95Se0.05 Nanorods for Room Temperature All-Solid-State Sodium Batteries with High Energy Density,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.High ionic conductivity electrolyte and intimate interfacial contact are crucial factors to realize high-performance all-solid-state sodium batteries. Na2.9PS3.95Se0.05 electrolyte with reduced particle size of 500 nm is first synthesized by a simple liquid-phase method and exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.21 × 10-4 S cm-1, which is comparable with that synthesized with a solid-state reaction. Meanwhile, a general interfacial architecture, that is, Na2.9PS3.95Se0.05 electrolyte uniformly anchored on Fe1-xS nanorods, is designed and successfully prepared by an in situ liquid-phase coating approach, forming core-shell structured Fe1-xS@Na2.9PS3.95Se0.05 nanorods and thus realizing an intimate contact interface. The Fe1-xS@Na2.9PS3.95Se0.05/Na2.9PS3.95Se0.05/Na all-solid-state sodium battery demonstrates high specific capacity and excellent rate capability at room temperature, showing reversible discharge capacities of 899.2, 795.5, 655.1, 437.9, and 300.4 mAh g-1 at current densities of 20, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mA g-1, respectively. The obtained all-solid-state sodium batteries show very high energy and power densities up to 910.6 Wh kg-1 and 201.6 W kg-1 based on the mass of Fe1-xS at current densities of 20 and 200 mA g-1, respectively. Moreover, the reaction mechanism of Fe1-xS is confirmed by means of ex situ X-ray diffraction techniques, showing that partially reversible reaction occurs in the Fe1-xS electrode after the second cycle, which gives the obtained all-solid-state sodium battery an exceptional cycling stability, exhibiting a high capacity of 494.3 mAh g-1 after cycling at 100 mA g-1 for 100 cycles.

Stabilizing electrochemical interfaces in viscoelastic liquid electrolytes,"Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved.Electrodeposition is a widely practiced method for creating metal, colloidal, and polymer coatings on conductive substrates. In the Newtonian liquid electrolytes typically used, the process is fundamentally unstable. The underlying instabilities have been linked to failure of microcircuits, dendrite formation on battery electrodes, and overlimiting conductance in ion-selective membranes. We report that viscoelastic electrolytes composed of semidilute solutions of very high-molecular weight neutral polymers suppress these instabilities by multiple mechanisms. The voltage window DV in which a liquid electrolyte can operate free of electroconvective instabilities is shown to be markedly extended in viscoelastic electrolytes and is a power-law function, DV : h1/4, of electrolyte viscosity, h. This power-law relation is replicated in the resistance to ion transport at liquid/solid interfaces. We discuss consequences of our observations and show that viscoelastic electrolytes enable stable electrodeposition of many metals, with the most profound effects observed for reactive metals, such as sodium and lithium. This finding is of contemporary interest for high-energy electrochemical energy storage.",Science Advances
Ionic liquids and derived materials for lithium and sodium batteries,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The ever-growing demand for advanced energy storage devices in portable electronics, electric vehicles and large scale power grids has triggered intensive research efforts over the past decade on lithium and sodium batteries. The key to improve their electrochemical performance and enhance the service safety lies in the development of advanced electrode, electrolyte, and auxiliary materials. Ionic liquids (ILs) are liquids consisting entirely of ions near room temperature, and are characterized by many unique properties such as ultralow volatility, high ionic conductivity, good thermal stability, low flammability, a wide electrochemical window, and tunable polarity and basicity/acidity. These properties create the possibilities of designing batteries with excellent safety, high energy/power density and long-term stability, and also provide better ways to synthesize known materials. IL-derived materials, such as poly(ionic liquids), ionogels and IL-tethered nanoparticles, retain most of the characteristics of ILs while being endowed with other favourable features, and thus they have received a great deal of attention as well. This review provides a comprehensive review of the various applications of ILs and derived materials in lithium and sodium batteries including Li/Na-ion, dual-ion, Li/Na-S and Li/Na-air (O2) batteries, with a particular emphasis on recent advances in the literature. Their unique characteristics enable them to serve as advanced resources, medium, or ingredient for almost all the components of batteries, including electrodes, liquid electrolytes, solid electrolytes, artificial solid-electrolyte interphases, and current collectors. Some thoughts on the emerging challenges and opportunities are also presented in this review for further development.",Chemical Society Reviews
Efficient Encapsulation of Small S2-4 Molecules in MOF-Derived Flowerlike Nitrogen-Doped Microporous Carbon Nanosheets for High-Performance Li-S Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is regarded as one of the most promising next-generation efficient energy storage systems because of its ultrahigh theoretical capacity of 1675 mAh/g and energy density of 2600 Wh/kg accompanied by the environmental benignity and abundance from natural sulfur. However, the insulating nature of sulfur and the dissolution of the polysulfides Li2Sn (4 ≤ n ≤ 8) seriously restrict its practical application. The metastable small sulfur molecules (S2-4) stored in microporous carbon (pore size of <0.6 nm) as the active materials can avoid the production of the soluble polysulfide and solve the shuttle effect thoroughly. In addition, the conductivity of sulfur can be also improved. However, the preparation of microporous carbon materials with reasonable pore size and unique morphology for efficiently encapsulating S2-4 is still challenging. Herein, three flowerlike microporous nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets with the pore size of <0.6 nm (namely, FMNCN-800, -900, and -1000) as the cathode materials in Li-S batteries were obtained from temperature-dependent carbonization of the metal-organic framework (MOF), Zn-TDPAT, which was from the simply reflux reaction of N-rich ligand H6TDPAT with Zn(II) salt. Our study showed that the FMNCN-900 from carbonization of Zn-TDPAT at 900 °C has suitable pore volume and nitrogen content, accommodating small S2-4 molecules in its micropores with the mass uptake of about 45%. Meanwhile, the appropriate amount of the nitrogen doping and the unique nanostructure of the flowerlike carbon nanosheet in the FMNCN-900 can effectively support its fast electronic transmission and lithium-ion conduction. The resulting S@FMNCN-900 composite cathode material presents the excellent electrochemical property in the Li-S battery (here the carbonate as electrolytes) with a reversible capacity of about 1220 mAh/g at 0.1C after 200 cycles and even 727 mAh/g at 2C after the long-term cycle of 1000 with only around 0.02% capacity loss per cycle. Obviously, the results indicate that the delicate construction of MOF-derived nitrogen-doped microporous carbon nanosheet is a promising strategy to develop novel electrode material for high-performing Li-S batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Selenium Impregnated Monolithic Carbons as Free-Standing Cathodes for High Volumetric Energy Lithium and Sodium Metal Batteries,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimEnergy density (energy per volume) is a key consideration for portable, automotive, and stationary battery applications. Selenium (Se) lithium and sodium metal cathodes are created that are monolithic and free-standing, and with record Se loading of 70 wt%. The carbon host is derived from nanocellulose, an abundant and sustainable forestry product. The composite is extremely dense (2.37 g cm−3), enabling theoretical volumetric capacity of 1120 mA h cm−3. Such architecture is fully distinct from previous Se–carbon nano- or micropowders, intrinsically offering up to 2× higher energy density. For Li storage, the cathode delivers reversible capacity of 1028 mA h cm−3 (620 mA h g−1) and 82% retention over 300 cycles. For Na storage, 848 mA h cm−3 (511 mA h g−1) is obtained with 98% retention after 150 cycles. The electrodes yield superb volumetric energy densities, being 1727 W h L−1 for Li–Se and 980 W h L−1 for Na–Se normalized by total composite mass and volume. Despite the low surface area, over 60% capacity is maintained as the current density is increased from 0.1 to 2 C (30 min charge) with Li or Na. Remarkably, the electrochemical kinetics with Li and Na are comparable, including the transition from interfacial to diffusional control.",Advanced Energy Materials

Ultrahigh Storage and Fast Diffusion of Na and K in Blue Phosphorene Anodes,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.In the wake of blue phosphorene's (BP) computational discovery and experimental realization, it has emerged as a versatile material with interesting optical, electrical, and mechanical properties. In this study, using first principles density functional theory calculations, we have investigated the adsorption and diffusion of Na and K over monolayer BP to assess its suitability as Na-ion and K-ion battery anodes. The optimized adsorption energies were found to be -0.96 eV for Na and -1.54 eV for K, which are sufficiently large to ensure stability and safety during operation. In addition, BP could adsorb Na and K atoms up to a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 which yields a high storage capacity of 865 mA h/g for both adatom species. Through examination of the electronic structure and projected density of states of BP as a function of Na/K concentration, we predict that the band gap of the system increasingly shrinks, and in the case of maximum K adsorption, the band gap diminishes completely. Additionally, the diffusion of Na and K over BP is observed to be ultrafast, especially for K, and anisotropic with modest energy barriers of 0.11 and 0.093 eV for Na and K, respectively. Building upon these findings, we employed vibrational analysis techniques with transition state theory to incorporate kinetic effects and predicted a diffusivity of 7.2 × 10-5 cm2/s for Na and 8.58 × 10-5 cm2/s for K on BP. Given these advantages, that is, ultrahigh capacity, electrical conductivity, and high Na/K diffusivity, we conclude that BP can be considered as an excellent candidate for anodes in Na- and K-ion batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

KGaA, WeinheimThe room temperature (RT) sodium–sulfur batteries (Na–S) hold great promise for practical applications including energy storage and conversion due to high energy density, long lifespan, and low cost, as well based on the abundant reserves of both sodium metal and sulfur. Herein, freestanding (C/S/BaTiO3)@TiO2 (CSB@TiO2) electrode with only ≈3 wt% of BaTiO3 additive and ≈4 nm thickness of amorphous TiO2 atomic layer deposition protective layer is rational designed, and first used for RT Na–S batteries. Results show that such cathode material exhibits high rate capability and excellent durability compared with pure C/S and C/S/BaTiO3 electrodes. Notably, this CSB@TiO2 electrode performs a discharge capacity of 524.8 and 382 mA h g−1 after 1400 cycles at 1 A g−1 and 3000 cycles at 2 A g−1, respectively. Such superior electrochemical performance is mainly attributed from the “BaTiO3-C-TiO2” synergetic structure within the matrix, which enables effectively inhibiting the shuttle effect, restraining the volumetric variation and stabilizing the ionic transport interface.",Advanced Functional Materials
Toward High-Safety Potassium-Sulfur Batteries Using a Potassium Polysulfide Catholyte and Metal-Free Anode,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Based on the reversible conversion reactions, K2Sx (5 ≤ x ≤ 6) →discharge K2S3 →charge K2S5, the proposed K-S battery delivered a high discharge capacity of ∼400 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C-rate with stable cycle retention (94% after 20 cycles) and good rate capability up to 2 C-rate. In addition, instead of an explosive and highly reactive potassium metal electrode, a full cell consisting of an electrochemically potassium-impregnated hard carbon and the K2Sx (5 ≤ x ≤ 6) catholyte was constructed to demonstrate the feasibility of a safe K-S battery system free of metallic potassium.",ACS Energy Letters
Predicting Ion Association in Sodium Electrolytes: A Transferrable Model for Investigating Glymes,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Given the prior success in developing lithium batteries for similar purposes, many of the same types of solvent molecules and salt pairings have been investigated as electrolytes in sodium-ion and sodium-oxygen systems. Of these candidates, ether-containing electrolytes have emerged as a promising material as a result of their electrochemical stability and utility in tuning the pertinent electrochemistry. The ability for ethers to chelate metal ions provides a unique feature to ion solvation structure; however its role in changing the association of ions in solution has not been fully explored. By using computational simulations validated by FTIR and NMR spectroscopy, detailed descriptions of the changes to solvation structure as a result of chelation and concentration were investigated for a series of ethers (monoglyme to tetraglyme). From these simulations it can clearly be seen that with increasing chelation, ion association is diminished in a nonlinear fashion. For a monoglyme solvent, sodiums are entirely coordinated by triflates in solution, even at low concentrations. In contrast, tetraglymes retain a significant solvent separation of sodium cations from triflate anions even at high concentrations. The former implies that the utility of monoglyme and diglyme solvents for sodium-air batteries in specific is likely linked to their favoring ion association, while the poor performance of tetraglyme is a result of its excessive binding to sodium. Finally, triglyme was shown to produce anomalous behavior as a result of a mismatch between sodium coordination and steric interactions.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Room-Temperature Aluminum-Sulfur Batteries with a Lithium-Ion-Mediated Ionic Liquid Electrolyte,"© 2017 Elsevier Inc.Aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) chemistry is attractive for the development of future-generation electrochemical energy storage technologies. However, to date, only limited reversible Al-S chemistry has been demonstrated. This paper demonstrates a highly reversible room-temperature Al-S battery with a lithium-ion (Li+-ion)-mediated ionic liquid electrolyte. Mechanistic studies with electrochemical and spectroscopic methodologies revealed that the enhancement in reversibility by Li+-ion mediation is attributed to the chemical reactivation of aluminum polysulfides and/or sulfide by Li+ during electrochemical cycling. The results obtained with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations suggest the presence of a Li3AlS3-like product with a mixture of Li2S- and Al2S3-like phases in the discharged sulfur cathode. With Li+-ion mediation, the cycle life of room-temperature Al-S batteries is greatly improved. The cell delivers an initial capacity of ∼1,000 mA hr g−1 and maintains a capacity of up to 600 mA hr g−1 after 50 cycles. Batteries represent an indispensable technology for electrifying the transportation sector and for storing electricity produced from renewable sources. Ambient-temperature non-aqueous sulfur battery chemistries are becoming increasingly appealing for these applications. Although lithium-sulfur batteries have been extensively investigated in recent years, aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) chemistry is more attractive from an economical, sustainability, and safety point of view. However, because of a lack of effective electrolytes, only limited reversibility has been realized so far with Al-S chemistry. This paper presents a lithium-ion mediation strategy for enhancing the reversibility of Al-S chemistry at ambient temperatures. A lithium-ion-mediated ionic liquid electrolyte remarkably improves the electrochemical performance of Al-S batteries. Based on a series of experimental and computational simulation analyses, the relevant mechanisms are presented. Manthiram and colleagues have validated a Li+-ion mediation approach to enhance the electrochemical reversibility of ambient-temperature aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) battery chemistry. They systematically investigated the relevant mechanisms with combined experimental and theoretical methodologies. Al-S chemistry is attractive for the development of high-energy, low-cost, safe, next-generation electrochemical energy storage technologies.",Chem
Cathode Dependence of Liquid-Alloy Na-K Anodes,© 2018 American Chemical Society.Alkali ions can be plated dendrite-free into a liquid alkali-metal anode. Commercialized Na-S battery technology operates above 300 °C. A low-cost Na-K alloy is liquid at 25 °C from 9.2 to 58.2 wt% of sodium; sodium and/or potassium can be plated dendrite-free in the liquid range at room temperature. The co-existence of two alkali metals in an anode raises a question: whether the liquid Na-K alloy acts as a Na or a K anode. Here we show the alkali-metal that is stripped from the liquid Na-K anode is dependent on the preference of the cathode host. It acts as the anode of a sodium rechargeable cell if the cathode host structure selectively accepts only Na+ ions; as the anode of a potassium rechargeable cell if the cathode accepts K+ ions in preference to Na+ ions. This dual-anode behavior means the liquid Na-K alkali-alloy can be applied as a dendrite-free anode in Na-metal batteries as well as K-metal batteries.,Journal of the American Chemical Society
Dual Functions of Potassium Antimony(III)-Tartrate in Tuning Antimony/Carbon Composites for Long-Life Na-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAntimony holds a high-specific capacity as a promising anode material for Na-ion batteries (SIBs) and much research is focused on solving the poor cycling stability issue associated with its large volume expansion during alloying/dealloying processes. Here, self-thermal-reduction method is successfully applied to prepare antimony/carbon rods (Sb/C rods) utilizing potassium antimony(III)-tartrate (C8H10O15Sb2K2) as a dual source of carbon matrix and metallic antimony. According to theory calculations and experiment results, the formation process is explicitly explored as follows: C8H10O15Sb2K2 → Sb2O3/C → Sb2O3/Sb/C → Sb/C rods. Notably, organic ligands in C8H10O15Sb2K2 can be gradually turned into amorphous carbon with simultaneous reduction of Sb3+ to metal Sb. Moreover, potassium chloride acts as an activator and a template during the course of carbonization, and synchronous reduction is introduced. Consequently, an antimony/carbon electrode material denoted as SbOC/C is formed, exhibiting a unique dual-carbon-modified structure and extensive SbOC bridge bonds that give rise to outstanding cycling performance and rate capacity. Specifically, the capacity is maintained at 404 mA h g−1 with 89% retention after 700 cycles at 500 mA g−1. The low-cost, self-thermal-reduction method and excellent electrode performances of electrode material make it attractive for large-scale energy storage systems.",Advanced Functional Materials
Reversible Redox Chemistry of Azo Compounds for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSustainable sodium-ion batteries (SSIBs) using renewable organic electrodes are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries for the large-scale renewable energy storage. However, the lack of high-performance anode material impedes the development of SSIBs. Herein, we report a new type of organic anode material based on azo group for SSIBs. Azobenzene-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid sodium salt is used as a model to investigate the electrochemical behaviors and reaction mechanism of azo compound. It exhibits a reversible capacity of 170 mAh g−1 at 0.2C. When current density is increased to 20C, the reversible capacities of 98 mAh g−1 can be retained for 2000 cycles, demonstrating excellent cycling stability and high rate capability. The detailed characterizations reveal that azo group acts as an electrochemical active site to reversibly bond with Na+. The reversible redox chemistry between azo compound and Na ions offer opportunities for developing long-cycle-life and high-rate SSIBs.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
"Long Cycle Life, Low Self-Discharge Sodium–Selenium Batteries with High Selenium Loading and Suppressed Polyselenide Shuttling","© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe use of selenium as a cathode in rechargeable sodium–selenium batteries is hampered by low Se loading, inferior electrode kinetics, and polyselenide shuttling between the cathode and anode. Here a high-performance sodium–selenium cell is presented by coupling a binder-free, self-interwoven carbon nanofiber–selenium cathode with a light-weight carbon-coated bifunctional separator. With this strategy, electrodes with a high Se mass loading (4.4 mg cm−2) render high reversible capacities of 599 mA h g−1 at 0.1C rate and 382 mA h g−1 at 5C rate. In addition, this novel cell offers good shelf-life with a low self-discharge, retaining 93.4% of its initial capacity even after resting for six months. As evidenced by experimental and density functional theory analysis, the remarkable dynamic (cycle life) and static (shelf-life) stabilities originate from the high electrical conductivity, improved Na-ion accessibility through the 3D interconnected open channels, and highly restrained polyselenide shuttle. The results demonstrate the viability of high-performance sodium–selenium batteries with high selenium loading.",Advanced Energy Materials
A review of model-based design tools for metal-air batteries,"© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The advent of large-scale renewable energy generation and electric mobility is driving a growing need for new electrochemical energy storage systems. Metal-air batteries, particularly zinc-air, are a promising technology that could help address this need. While experimental research is essential, it can also be expensive and time consuming. The utilization of well-developed theory-based models can improve researchers’ understanding of complex electrochemical systems, guide development, and more efficiently utilize experimental resources. In this paper, we review the current state of metal-air batteries and the modeling methods that can be implemented to advance their development. Microscopic and macroscopic modeling methods are discussed with a focus on continuum modeling derived from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. An applied example of zinc-air battery engineering is presented.",Batteries
Recent Progress in Iron-Based Electrode Materials for Grid-Scale Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimGrid-scale energy storage batteries with electrode materials made from low-cost, earth-abundant elements are needed to meet the requirements of sustainable energy systems. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with iron-based electrodes offer an attractive combination of low cost, plentiful structural diversity and high stability, making them ideal candidates for grid-scale energy storage systems. Although various iron-based cathode and anode materials have been synthesized and evaluated for sodium storage, further improvements are still required in terms of energy/power density and long cyclic stability for commercialization. In this Review, progress in iron-based electrode materials for SIBs, including oxides, polyanions, ferrocyanides, and sulfides, is briefly summarized. In addition, the reaction mechanisms, electrochemical performance enhancements, structure–composition–performance relationships, merits and drawbacks of iron-based electrode materials for SIBs are discussed. Such iron-based electrode materials will be competitive and attractive electrodes for next-generation energy storage devices.",Small
Tailored Organic Electrode Material Compatible with Sulfide Electrolyte for Stable All-Solid-State Sodium Batteries,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAll-solid-state sodium batteries (ASSSBs) with nonflammable electrolytes and ubiquitous sodium resource are a promising solution to the safety and cost concerns for lithium-ion batteries. However, the intrinsic mismatch between low anodic decomposition potential of superionic sulfide electrolytes and high operating potentials of sodium-ion cathodes leads to a volatile cathode–electrolyte interface and undesirable cell performance. Here we report a high-capacity organic cathode, Na4C6O6, that is chemically and electrochemically compatible with sulfide electrolytes. A bulk-type ASSSB shows high specific capacity (184 mAh g−1) and one of the highest specific energies (395 Wh kg−1) among intercalation compound-based ASSSBs. The capacity retentions of 76 % after 100 cycles at 0.1 C and 70 % after 400 cycles at 0.2 C represent the record stability for ASSSBs. Additionally, Na4C6O6 functions as a capable anode material, enabling a symmetric all-organic ASSSB with Na4C6O6 as both cathode and anode materials.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Controlling the polysulfide diffusion in lithium-sulfur batteries with a polymer membrane with intrinsic nanoporosity,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdPolysulfide-shuttle has been a critical concern for the advancement of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Celgard membranes that are generally used in Li-S batteries exhibit a porous structure with a pore dimension generally on the micrometer scale. During cell operation, soluble lithium polysulfide species can easily migrate from the cathode through the porous separator and react with the lithium-metal anode. Such an unexpected chemical reaction induces a cascade of negative effects on the overall performance of Li-S batteries. Use of ion-selective membranes with reduced pore size provides a promising approach to suppress the migration of polysulfide species. In this study, a membrane based on a polymer with intrinsic nanoporosity (PIN) with a pore size of <1.0 nm is explored as a separator in Li-S batteries to mitigate the polysulfide-shuttle problem. The PIN membrane exhibits a unique structure with pore dimensions of less than 1.0 nm, which allows the transport of Li-ions, but effectively blocks the migration of dissolved polysulfides. As a result, the cycling performance of Li-S batteries is significantly improved. In addition to demonstrating a PIN-membrane Li-S battery, the structural characteristics of the PIN membrane have been characterized by a series of experimental methodologies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.",Materials Today Energy
"Cruising in ceramics—discovering new structures for all-solid-state batteries—fundamentals, materials, and performances","© 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Energy storage research has drawn much attention recently due to increasing demand for carbon neutral electrical energy from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydrothermal. Various electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies are being considered for their integration into smart grid systems, of which batteries seem to play a vital role due to their wide range of energy densities. In this review, we provide the current status and recent advances in solid-state (ceramic) electrolytes based on inorganic compounds for all-solid-state batteries. This paper is specifically focused on the fundamentals, materials, and performances of solid electrolytes in batteries. A wide spectrum of inorganic solid-state electrolytes is presented in terms of their chemical composition, crystal structure, and ion conduction mechanism. Furthermore, the advantages and main issues associated with different types of inorganic solid electrolytes, including β-alumina, NASICON and LISICON-type, perovskites, and garnet-type for all-solid-state batteries are presented. Among these solid electrolytes, Zr and Ta-based Li-stuffed garnets exhibit high Li-ion conductivity, electrochemical stability window (up to 6 V/Li at room temperature), and chemical stability against reaction with molten elemental Li. However, their stability under humidity and carbon dioxide should be improved to decrease the fabrication and operational costs.",Ionics
Nitrogen-doped nanostructured porous carbon derived from monosodium glutamate for high-performance lithium sulfur battery,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdCarbon host materials play an important role in improving the electrochemical performances of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this work, we have successfully prepared nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (NPCN) by using low-cost raw materials (monosodium glutamate) via a facile carbonization approach without any activation process. The obtained NPCN-800 possesses a special micro/mesoporous structure, with a relatively high BET surface area and appropriate nitrogen doping. By employing the NPCN-800 as a reservoir to impregnate sulfur as the cathode material of lithium-sulfur batteries, the resulting sulfur/carbon composite with 65.5 wt% sulfur exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1070 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and enhanced capacity retention of 680 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles. Moreover, a capacity of 452 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C is achieved over 200 cycles with 98.6% Coulombic efficiency. The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure (physisorption) and N-doping (chemisorption).",Materials Research Bulletin
Revitalized interest in vanadium pentoxide as cathode material for lithium-ion batteries and beyond,"© 2017Revitalized interest in vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) arises from two very important developments in rechargeable batteries. One is the push on lithium-ion batteries for higher energy density batteries: using lithium metal as anode and searching for higher capacity and high voltage cathode. Using lithium metal anode eliminates the big obstacle for V2O5 cathode that does not come with lithium ions. V2O5 possesses the highest reversible capacity among known cathode materials. Another is the recent intensive research for cathode materials beyond Li-ion batteries (LIBs). In the past several years, interest in complementary alkali-ion battery technologies has seen a tremendous resurgence. Out of the set of alternative chemistries, V2O5 has seen the most considerable and promising gains as a cathode for Na-ion battery (NIB), Mg-ion battery (MIB), and other metal batteries. Unlike LIBs, these systems face a set of new challenges as dictated by the properties of the transported ionic species and the consequent effects on the electrode materials. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most interesting or surprising phenomena, the important questions raised and next experimental and theoretical steps to advance V2O5 cathode materials in the field of metal batteries. This review focused on selected topics covering the influences of surface chemistry, crystallinity, doping, defects, and nanostructures on the lithium-ion intercalation properties and recent developments on other metal batteries including NIBs and MIBs. The perspectives and remaining challenges for V2O5 based cathode materials have been discussed.",Energy Storage Materials
Liquid-phase sintering of highly Na+ ion conducting Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramics using Na3BO3 additive,"© 2017 The American Ceramic SocietyNa3Zr2Si2PO12 (NASICON) is a promising material as a solid electrolyte for all-solid-state sodium batteries. Nevertheless, one challenge for the application of NASICON in batteries is their high sintering temperature above 1200°C, which can lead to volatilization of light elements and undesirable side reactions with electrode materials at such high temperatures. In this study, liquid-phase sintering of NASICON with a Na3BO3 (NBO) additive was performed for the first time to lower the NASICON sintering temperature. A dense NASICON-based ceramic was successfully obtained by sintering at 900°C with 4.8 wt% NBO. This liquid-phase sintered NASICON ceramic exhibited high total conductivity of ~1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature and low conduction activation energy of 28 kJ mol−1. Since the room-temperature conductivity is identical to that of conventional high-temperature-sintered NASICON, NBO was demonstrated as a good liquid-phase sintering additive for NASICON solid electrolyte. In the NASICON with 4.8 wt% NBO ceramic, most of the NASICON grains directly bonded with each other and some submicron sodium borates segregated in particulate form without full penetration to NASICON grain boundaries. This characteristic composite microstructure contributed to the high conductivity of the liquid-phase sintered NASICON.",Journal of the American Ceramic Society
Low temperature sintering of Na1 + xZr2SixP3 − xO12 by the addition of Na3BO3,"© 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.Na1 + xZr2SixP3 − xO12 (NASICON)-based solid electrolytes were prepared by liquid phase sintering with a Na3BO3 additive to lower the NASICON sintering temperature. NASICON was sintered at 700 °C with 9.1 wt% Na3BO3. The obtained NASICON ceramic exhibited high room-temperature conductivity of 1 × 10− 4 S cm− 1, which were three orders of magnitude higher than that of a Na3BO3-free sample. SEM observation of this ceramic revealed that neck growth among NASICON grains proceeded reasonably and that sodium borates segregated in particulate form without full penetration to NASICON grain boundaries. This characteristic microstructure is expected to contribute to the high conductivity of the NASICON-Na3BO3 ceramic.",Scripta Materialia
Review of Carbon Materials for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium-sulfur battery as one of the most promising and attractive candidate among the emerging electrical energy storage has attracted enormous attentions. It has superior characteristics of high specific energy density (2600 Wh kg−1) and high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g−1), which is equal to 3–5 times of lithium-ion batteries, and more closed to the requirement of the pure electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. Furthermore, sulfur element is inexpensive, naturally abundant, and environmentally friendly. However, the commercial application of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) still faces some major technical obstacles such as the low electrical conductivity of sulfur, the shuttle effect of polysulfides, and the drastic volume expansion during charge/discharge process. In this review paper, we focus on some of the effective strategies in boosting the electrochemical performance of LSBs through the development of sulfur/carbon composite electrode materials, including the use of porous carbons, carbon nanotubes/fibers, and graphene. The integration of carbon materials and sulfur can efficiently improve the utilization of active materials, enhance the conductivity of cathode materials, and provide a polysulfides barrier. Simultaneously, the challenges and prospects on LSBs in the near future are also presented and discussed.",ChemistrySelect
Advancement of technology towards developing Na-ion batteries,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.The Na-ion-batteries are considered much attention for the next-generation power-sources due to the high abundance of Na resources that lower the cost and become the alternative for the state of the art Li-ion batteries in future. In this review, the recently reported potential cathode and anode candidates for Na-ion-batteries are identified in-light-of-their high-performance for the development of Na-ion-full-cells. Further, the recent-progress on the Na-ion full-cells including the strategies used to improve the high cycling-performance (stable even up-to 50000 cycles), operating voltage (even ≥ 3.7 V), capacity (>350 mAhg−1 even at 1000 mAg−1 (based-on-mass-of-the-anode)), and energy density (even up-to 400 Whkg−1) are reviewed. In addition, Na-ion-batteries with the electrodes containing reduced graphene oxide, and the recent developments on symmetric Na-ion-batteries are discussed. Further, this paper identifies the promising Na-ion-batteries including the strategies used to assemble full-cell using hard-carbon-anodes, Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes, and other-electrode-materials. Then, comparison between aqueous and non-aqueous Na-ion-batteries in terms of voltage and energy density has been given.

Electrospun-sodiumtetrafluoroborate-polyethylene oxide membranes for solvent-free sodium ion transport in solid state sodium ion batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Electrospinning is used to fabricate sodium ion conducting fiber membranes composed of polyethylene oxide (PEO), sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4), and succinonitrile (SN) as plasticizer. As compared to conventionally prepared lithium electrolyte membranes with identical composition (PEO:SN:LiBF4), those membranes exhibit conductivities up to 10−4 S cm−1 at 328 K (activation energy ∼36 kJ mol−1, 36:8:1 membrane), which favors such systems as a solid-state electrolyte alternative for batteries. The conduction mechanism is evaluated and the ion mobility are examined. We identified the segment mobility of the polyethylene oxide as the main driving force for the enhanced ion mobility in the membranes. The introduction of SN has only a minor influence on the conductivity and segment mobility at room temperature, but extents the anion and cation mobility to temperatures below ambient. For the 36:8:1 (PEO:SN:NaBF4) membrane we found the highest ion mobility of all membranes under investigation. A comparison of the present sodium membranes with lithium systems of the same composition shows that the overall performance of the sodium systems is comparable. Taking plasticizer-free sodium membranes into account they perform even better than the lithium containing counterparts, and plasticizer-modified membranes show only half an order of magnitude lower conductivities than comparable lithium ones.",Journal of Power Sources
High capacity hard carbon derived from lotus stem as anode for sodium ion batteries,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.Porous hard carbons are synthesized via carbonizing lotus stems with naturally hierarchical structures. The hard carbon carbonized at 1400 °C (LS1400) delivers a total capacity 350 mAh g−1 in the current density of 100 mA g−1 and a plateau capacity of 250 mAh g−1. Even cycled at 100 mA g−1 after 450 cycles, the capacity still retains 94%. Further investigation shows that the sodium storage of LS carbons involves Na+ adsorption in the defect sites, Na+ insertion and Na metal deposition in the closed pores. However, the Na metal deposition in closed pores mainly contribute to the plateau capacity, leading to the excellent sodium storage performance of LS1400 with a large closed pore ratio of 66%. The results show that the intrinsic structure of natural biomass can inspire us to design hard carbon with large closed pore ratio as excellent anode for sodium ion batteries.",Journal of Power Sources
Nature-Inspired 2D-Mosaic 3D-Gradient Mesoporous Framework: Bimetal Oxide Dual-Composite Strategy toward Ultrastable and High-Capacity Lithium Storage,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.In allusion to traditional transition-metal oxide (TMO) anodes for lithium-ion batteries, which face severe volume variation and poor conductivity, herein a bimetal oxide dual-composite strategy based on two-dimensional (2D)-mosaic three-dimensional (3D)-gradient design is proposed. Inspired by natural mosaic dominance phenomena, Zn1-xCoxO/ZnCo2O4 2D-mosaic-hybrid mesoporous ultrathin nanosheets serve as building blocks to assemble into a 3D Zn-Co hierarchical framework. Moreover, a series of derivative frameworks with high evolution are controllably synthesized, based on which a facile one-pot synthesis process can be developed. From a component-composite perspective, both Zn1-xCoxO and ZnCo2O4 provide superior conductivity due to bimetal doping effect, which is verified by density functional theory calculations. From a structure-composite perspective, 2D-mosaic-hybrid mode gives rise to ladder-type buffering and electrochemical synergistic effect, thus realizing mutual stabilization and activation between the mosaic pair, especially for Zn1-xCoxO with higher capacity yet higher expansion. Moreover, the inside-out Zn-Co concentration gradient in 3D framework and rich oxygen vacancies further greatly enhance Li storage capability and stability. As a result, a high reversible capacity (1010 mA h g-1) and areal capacity (1.48 mA h cm-2) are attained, while ultrastable cyclability is obtained during high-rate and long-term cycles, rending great potential of our 2D-mosaic 3D-gradient design together with facile synthesis.",ACS Nano
Investigation of the graphene-electrolyte interface in Li-air batteries: A molecular dynamics study,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In this work the behavior of the main reactants (Li+, O2) of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acetonitrile solvent near the multi-layer graphene edge has been studied. It was observed by molecular dynamics simulations that the concentration distributions of the Li+ and O2 represent a ""chessboard"" structure. It was ascertained that the concentrations of the lithium ions and oxygen molecules reach their maximum values near the graphene edges pushed out from the surface, which may act as nucleation centers for the formation of crystalline products of the ORR. The maps of the free energy were estimated for the Li+ and O2. Energy optimal trajectories for the adsorption of oxygen molecules and lithium ions were found. Moreover, the distributions of the electric potential were obtained near the following carbon surfaces: single- and multi-layer graphene edge, graphene plane, which shows the qualitative differences in the double-layer structure.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series
Effects of post-synthesis activation and relative humidity on adsorption performance of ZIF-8 for capturing toluene from a gas phase in a continuous mode,"© 2018 by the authors.Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) was used as an adsorbent for the removal of toluene in its gas phase at different relative humidity (RH). High-purity ZIF-8 with an average particle size of 0.64 μm synthesized from an aqueous solution at room temperature, and then characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Dynamic adsorption (continuous mode) experiments of toluene on ZIF-8 were studied using breakthrough curves. The effects of thermal pretreatment (activation) under dry air and N2 atmospheres on the adsorbent performances was studied. ZIF-8 activated at 300 °C for 3 h under dry air showed the highest adsorption capacity of 562.17 mg.g-1. Furthermore, it was observed that the adsorption of toluene on ZIF-8 was significantly decreased at 80% RH. The experimental data of dynamic adsorption well fitted into the Thomas and Yan mathematical models.",Applied Sciences (Switzerland)
Operando Monitoring of the Solution-Mediated Discharge and Charge Processes in a Na-O2 Battery Using Liquid-Electrochemical Transmission Electron Microscopy,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Although in sodium-oxygen (Na-O2) batteries show promise as high-energy storage systems, this technology is still the subject of intense fundamental research, owing to the complex reaction by which it operates. To understand the formation mechanism of the discharge product, sodium superoxide (NaO2), advanced experimental tools must be developed. Here we present for the first time the use of a Na-O2 microbattery using a liquid aprotic electrolyte coupled with fast imaging transmission electron microscopy to visualize, in real time, the mechanism of NaO2 nucleation/growth. We observe that the formation of NaO2 cubes during reduction occurs by a solution-mediated nucleation process. Furthermore, we unambiguously demonstrate that the subsequent oxidation of NaO2 of which little is known also proceeds via a solution mechanism. We also provide insight into the cell electrochemistry via the visualization of an outer shell of parasitic reaction product, formed through chemical reaction at the interface between the growing NaO2 cubes and the electrolyte, and suggest that this process is responsible for the poor cyclability of Na-O2 batteries. The assessment of the discharge-charge mechanistic in Na-O2 batteries through operando electrochemical transmission electron microscopy visualization should facilitate the development of this battery technology.",Nano Letters
Tuning light emission towards white light from a naphthalenediimide-based entangled metal-organic framework by mixing aromatic guest molecules,"© 2018 by the authors.Taking advantage of the outstanding properties of a naphthalenediimide-based entangled porous coordination polymer, a simple strategy for the achievement of white light emission is herein presented. The dynamic structural transformation of the [Zn2(bdc)2(dpNDI)]n metal-organic framework enhances the interactions with aryl-guests giving rise to different luminescence colors upon UV (ultraviolet) illumination. Thus, through the rational selection of those small aromatic guest molecules with different electron donor substituents at the appropriate proportion, the emission color was tuned by mixture ratio of guest molecules and even white light emission was achieved. Furthermore, domains in large crystals with a complementary response to linearly polarized light were noticed.",Polymers
Modifying the ORR route by the addition of lithium and potassium salts in Na-O2 batteries,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdSodium-oxygen (Na-O2) batteries have been considered as promising alternatives to lithium-oxygen batteries for high energy density applications. Herein, we report the utilisation of Li+ and K+ salts to the Na+ based electrolyte in order to tailor the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) route in Na-O2 cells. Li+ salt addition promotes a surface confined ORR due to the incapability to stabilize superoxide radical intermediate product in the electrolyte leading to a poor electrochemical performance. The discharge capacities achieved using K+ salt additive are also lower than those obtained without it due to the incapability of KO2 to precipitate on the oxygen electrode, turning the initial solution-phase ORR to a surface-confined ORR after supersaturation. In this work we show that stabilization of the intermediate products and an efficient precipitation of the final products at the oxygen electrode are key factors governing the electrochemical performance in Na–O2 batteries.",Electrochimica Acta
A polysulfide-infiltrated carbon cloth cathode for high-performance flexible lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.For practical application of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs), it is crucial to develop sulfur cathodes with high areal capacity and cycle stability in a simple and inexpensive manner. In this study, a carbon cloth infiltrated with a sulfur-containing electrolyte solution (CC-S) was utilized as an additive-free, flexible, high-sulfur-loading cathode. A freestanding carbon cloth performed double duty as a current collector and a sulfur-supporting/trapping material. The active material in the form of Li2 S6 dissolved in a 1 M LiTFSI-DOL/DME solution was simply infiltrated into the carbon cloth (CC) during cell fabrication, and its optimal loading amount was found to be in a range between 2 and 10 mg/cm2 via electrochemical characterization. It was found that the interwoven carbon microfibers retained structural integrity against volume expansion/contraction and that the embedded uniform micropores enabled a high loading and an efficient trapping of sulfur species during cycling. The LSB coin cell employing the CC-S electrode with an areal sulfur loading of 6 mg/cm2 exhibited a high areal capacity of 4.3 and 3.2 mAh/cm2 at C/10 for 145 cycles and C/3 for 200 cycles, respectively, with minor capacity loss (<0.03%/cycle). More importantly, such high performance could also be realized in flexible pouch cells with dimensions of 2 cm × 6 cm before and after 300 bending cycles. Simple and inexpensive preparation of sulfur cathodes using CC-S electrodes, therefore, has great potential for the manufacture of high-performance flexible LSBs.",Nanomaterials
The Role of the Electrode Surface in Na–Air Batteries: Insights in Electrochemical Product Formation and Chemical Growth of NaO2,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe Na–air battery, because of its high energy density and low charging overpotential, is a promising candidate for low-cost energy storage, hence leading to intensive research. However, to achieve such a battery, the role of the positive electrode material in the discharge process must be understood. This issue is herein addressed by exploring the electrochemical reduction of oxygen, as well as the chemical formation and precipitation of NaO2 using different electrodes. Whereas a minor influence of the electrode surface is demonstrated on the electrochemical formation of NaO2, a strong dependence of the subsequent chemical precipitation of NaO2 is identified. In the origin, this effect stems from the surface energy and O2/O2− affinity of the electrode. The strong interaction of Au with O2/O2− increases the nucleation rate and leads to an altered growth process when compared to C surfaces. Consequently, thin (3 µm) flakes of NaO2 are found on Au, whereas on C large cubes (10 µm) of NaO2 are formed. This has significant impact on the cell performance and leads to four times higher capacity when C electrodes with low surface energy and O2/O2− affinity are used. It is hoped that these findings will enable the design of new positive electrode materials with optimized surfaces.",Advanced Energy Materials
Sodium-Ion Batteries (a Review),"© 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.State-of-the-art in the studies of sodium-ion batteries is discussed in comparison with their deeper developed lithium-ion analogs. The principal problem hindering the development of competitive sodium-ion batteries is the low effectiveness of the electrode materials at hand. The principal efforts in the formation of anodes for the sodium-ion batteries are reduced to the development of materials based on carbon, metals, alloys, and transition metal oxides. Cathode materials are searched among oxides (first of all, layered) and salt systems. Synthesis of electrolytes for the sodium-ion batteries is not sufficiently attended to. Nowadays it is sodium salt solutions in organic solvents that are dominated; however, polymer and solid electrolytes with sodium conductivity may be thought of as very perspective.

Environmentally Sustainable Aluminum-Coordinated Poly(tetrahydroxybenzoquinone) as a Promising Cathode for Sodium Ion Batteries,"© 2018 American Chemical Society.Na-ion batteries are attractive as an alternative to Li-ion batteries because of their lower cost. Organic compounds have been considered as promising electrode materials due to their environmental friendliness and molecular diversity. Herein, aluminum-coordinated poly(tetrahydroxybenzoquinone) (P(THBQ-Al)), one of the coordination polymers, is introduced for the first time as a promising cathode for Na-ion batteries. P(THBQ-Al) is synthesized through a facile coordination reaction between benzoquinonedihydroxydiolate (C6O6H22-) and Al3+ as ligands and complex metal ions, respectively. Tetrahydroxybenzoquinone is environmentally sustainable, because it can be obtained from natural resources such as orange peels. Benzoquinonedihydroxydiolate also contributes to delivering high reversible capacity, because each benzoquinonedihydroxydiolate unit is capable of two electron reactions through the sodiation of its conjugated carbonyl groups. Electrochemically inactive Al3+ improves the structural stability of P(THBQ-Al) during cycling because of a lack of a change in its oxidation state. Moreover, P(THBQ-Al) is thermally stable and insoluble in nonaqueous electrolytes. These result in excellent electrochemical performance including a high reversible capacity of 113 mA h g-1 and stable cycle performance with negligible capacity fading over 100 cycles. Moreover, the reaction mechanism of P(THBQ-Al) is clarified through ex situ XPS and IR analyses, in which the reversible sodiation of C=O into C-O-Na is observed.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Graphene oxide membranes for electrochemical energy storage and conversion,"© 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCGraphene oxide (GO) membranes have recently attracted considerable attention for various applications involving filtration. In electrochemical systems, GO membranes serve as a separator or solid-state electrolyte; the roles which have been played for over four decades by the commercial ionic polymers such as Nafion. Owing to the versatility of GO membranes, they have shown an incredible potential for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In lithium-sulphur batteries and similar electrochemical systems in which the electrode redox system is based on a conversion mechanism and subject to the so-called shuttle effect, a selective membrane can facilitate the transport of the electroactive species such as Li ions while blocking the release of the electroactive material (e.g., polysulphides) into the other half-cell. The same requirement is essential for the fabrication of redox flow batteries. Owing to the growing interest in flexible supercapacitors, there is a desire to replace liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes, and GO membrane provides an appropriate scaffold for trapping gel electrolytes. The performance of Nafion in fuel cells has also been improved by the preparation of GO/Nafion membranes. All these different applications reveal the practical potential of GO membranes for the future energy storage and conversion.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
Building Organic/Inorganic Hybrid Interphases for Fast Interfacial Transport in Rechargeable Metal Batteries,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.We report a facile in situ synthesis that utilizes readily accessible SiCl4 cross-linking chemistry to create durable hybrid solid–electrolyte interphases (SEIs) on metal anodes. Such hybrid SEIs composed of Si-interlinked OOCOR molecules that host LiCl salt exhibit fast charge-transfer kinetics and as much as five-times higher exchange current densities, in comparison to their spontaneously formed analogues. Electrochemical analysis and direct optical visualization of Li and Na deposition in symmetric Li/Li and Na/Na cells show that the hybrid SEI provides excellent morphological control at high current densities (3–5 mA cm−2) for Li and even for notoriously unstable Na metal anodes. The fast interfacial transport attributes of the SEI are also found to be beneficial for Li-S cells and stable electrochemical cycling was achieved in galvanostatic studies at rates as high as 2 C. Our work therefore provides a promising approach towards rational design of multifunctional, elastic SEIs that overcome the most serious limitations of spontaneously formed interphases on high-capacity metal anodes.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition

KGaA, Weinhei/1.Recently, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are extensively explored and are regarded as one of the most promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries for electrochemical energy conversion and storage, owing to the abundant raw material resources, low cost, and similar electrochemical behavior of elemental sodium compared to lithium.

Nanoscale Carbon Modified α-MnO2 Nanowires: Highly Active and Stable Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts with Low Carbon Content,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Carbon-coated α-MnO2 nanowires (C-MnO2 NWs) were prepared from α-MnO2 NWs by a two-step sucrose coating and pyrolysis method. This method resulted in the formation of a thin, porous, low mass-percentage amorphous carbon coating (<5 nm, ≤1.2 wt % C) on the nanowire with an increase in single-nanowire electronic conductivity of roughly 5 orders of magnitude (α-MnO2, 3.2 × 10-6 S cm-1 C-MnO2, 0.52 S cm-1) and an increase in surface Mn3+ (average oxidation state: α-MnO2, 3.88; C-MnO2, 3.66) while suppressing a phase change to Mn3O4 at high temperature. The enhanced physical and electronic properties of the C-MnO2 NWs - enriched surface Mn3+ and high conductivity - are manifested in the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), where a 13-fold increase in specific activity (α-MnO2, 0.13 A m-2 C-MnO2, 1.70 A m-2) and 6-fold decrease in charge transfer resistance (α-MnO2, 6.2 kω; C-MnO2, 0.9 kω) were observed relative to the precursor α-MnO2 NWs. The C-MnO2 NWs, composed of ∼99 wt % MnO2 and ∼1 wt % carbon coating, also demonstrated an ORR onset potential within 20 mV of commercial 20% Pt/C and a chronoamperometric current/stability equal to or greater than 20% Pt/C at high overpotential (0.4 V vs RHE) and high temperature (60 °C) with no additional conductive carbon.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Biphase Cobalt–Manganese Oxide with High Capacity and Rate Performance for Aqueous Sodium-Ion Electrochemical Energy Storage,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Manganese-based metal oxide electrode materials are of great importance in electrochemical energy storage for their favorable redox behavior, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, their storage capacity and cycle life in aqueous Na-ion electrolytes is not satisfactory. Herein, the development of a biphase cobalt–manganese oxide (CoMnO) nanostructured electrode material is reported, comprised of a layered MnO2⋅H2O birnessite phase and a (Co0.83Mn0.13Va0.04)tetra(Co0.38Mn1.62)octaO3.72 (Va: vacancy; tetra: tetrahedral sites; octa: octahedral sites) spinel phase, verified by neutron total scattering and pair distribution function analyses. The biphase CoMnO material demonstrates an excellent storage capacity toward Na-ions in an aqueous electrolyte (121 mA h g−1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 in the half-cell and 81 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 after 5000 cycles in full-cells), as well as high rate performance (57 mA h g−1 a rate of 360 C). Electrokinetic analysis and in situ X-ray diffraction measurements further confirm that the synergistic interaction between the spinel and layered phases, as well as the vacancy of the tetrahedral sites of spinel phase, contribute to the improved capacity and rate performance of the CoMnO material by facilitating both diffusion-limited redox and capacitive charge storage processes.",Advanced Functional Materials
Ion–Solvent Complexes Promote Gas Evolution from Electrolytes on a Sodium Metal Anode,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium and sodium metal batteries are considered as promising next-generation energy storage devices due to their ultrahigh energy densities. The high reactivity of alkali metal toward organic solvents and salts results in side reactions, which further lead to undesirable electrolyte depletion, cell failure, and evolution of flammable gas. Herein, first-principles calculations and in situ optical microscopy are used to study the mechanism of organic electrolyte decomposition and gas evolution on a sodium metal anode. Once complexed with sodium ions, solvent molecules show a reduced LUMO, which facilitates the electrolyte decomposition and gas evolution. Such a general mechanism is also applicable to lithium and other metal anodes. We uncover the critical role of ion–solvent complexation for the stability of alkali metal anodes, reveal the mechanism of electrolyte gassing, and provide a mechanistic guidance to electrolyte and lithium/sodium anode design for safe rechargeable batteries.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition

Thiokol with excellent restriction on the shuttle effect in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2017 by the author.Commercial application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is still greatly hampered by several issues, especially the shuttle effect of polysulfides. In this work, we proposed a simple but effective method to restrain the shuttle of the soluble polysulfides by adopting a novel binder of Thiokol in the sulfur cathode. Compared to the battery with conventional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder, the initial discharge capacity for the battery with the Thiokol binder were increased by 42%, that is from 578 to 819 mAh/g, while the capacity after 200 cycles were increased by 201%, which is from 166 to 501 mAh/g. Besides, according to the rate capability test cycling from 0.1 to 1 C, the battery with the Thiokol binder still released a capacity amounting to 90.9% of the initial capacity, when the current density returned back to 0.1 C. Based on the UV-vis and ex situ XRD results, it is reasonably proposed that the reactions with polysulfides of the Thiokol help to restrain the shuttle effect of polysulfides. It is therefore suggested that the novel Thiokol binder holds promise for application in high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.",Applied Sciences (Switzerland)

All right reserved.Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) microtube electrodes doped with different acids and surfactants were obtained by one-step electrochemical deposition method and could be used for flexible and all-solid-state supercapacitors (SCs). We also investigated the effect of deposition time on the capacitance performance of PEDOT microtubes doped with the same acid medium and surfactant. The structures of the final product were characterized by different characterization techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and FT-IR spectra. The electrochemical results showed that the capacitance of PEDOT microtubes doped with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) could be improved significantly. The areal capacitance of the prepared supercapacitor with deposition time of 600 s could achieve to 113.5 mF • cm-2 at the scan rate of 10 mV • s-1. The areal capacitances under the different bending angles remained at 93% of initial capacitive value revealing that the supercapacitor had highly mechanical stability. In addition, it remained 95.5% of the initial capacitive value after 2 000 cycles at a current density of 0.6 mA • cm-2 showing its superior cycling stability.

Electrochemistry of the NaI-AlCl3 molten salt system for use as catholyte in sodium metal batteries,"© The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.Molten salt electrolytes show promise as safe, effective elements of emerging low to intermediate temperature molten sodium batteries. Here we investigate the NaI-AlCl3 molten salt system for its electrochemical and physical properties at 150 and 180°C, temperatures recently used to demonstrate a new NaI battery using this molten salt system. Molten salt compositions ranging from 20–75% NaI were prepared and electrochemically interrogated with carbon fiber ultramicroelectrodes utilizing cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and differential pulse voltammetry. Results indicate that at very high or very low NaI concentrations, secondary phases present hinder diffusion of the redox-active species, potentially impacting the current density of the system. Furthermore, a concentration-independent chronoamperometric analysis technique was leveraged to determine effective diffusion coefficients of active I− in the melt phase. Collectively, the physical characterization and electrochemical properties of the tested salts indicate that the catholyte composition can significantly affect the physical state, current density, ionic diffusion, and voltage window of these promising NaI-AlCl3 molten salt battery catholytes.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
Proton-coupled reversible redox reaction of zinc-terephthalate metal-organic framework,"©The Electrochemical Society.Redox properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) between Zn2+ ion and terephthalic acid (TPA) in compositions as Zn3(OH)4(TPA)・6H2O, Zn4(OH)6(TPA) and Zn2(OH)2(TPA)・H2O were examined. Among them, Zn4(OH)6(TPA) exhibited a remarkable reversible redox centered at around -1 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a neutral KCl aqueous solution. While cathodic reduction was slow resulting in a broad peak in its cyclic voltammogram, the oxidation was relatively fast, both showing diffusion-limited behavior. Slight acidification of the electrolyte resulted in a significant acceleration of the redox, while the redox potential was independent on pH. Peak splitting systematically increased on increasing the scan rate. Thus, proton exchange by TPA was concluded, for its field driven migration to limit the reaction rates. Potentiostatic charging / discharging experiments confirmed coulombic reversibility over 92% and revealed an active fraction of 17.7% per coated molar amount, so that the proton-coupled redox was achieved within the MOF bulk.",ECS Transactions

Creating ionic channels in single-ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte by manipulating phase separation structure,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Single-ion conducting solid polymer electrolytes (SICSPEs) with high ionic conductivity are vital for next-generation electrochemical devices. Herein, we presented a novel method to manipulate the phase separation structure of SICSPEs, leading to the construction of long-range conducting ionic channels for rapid ion transport. Ionic nanowires were first fabricated by anchoring numerous lithium sulfonyl(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide groups on poly(ether ether ketone) backbones. Then, the ionic nanowires were dispersed in a well-designed hyperbranched polymer, poly(polyethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate), to fabricate a blend membrane. Intertwined and continuous ionic channels were observed in the blend membrane by transmission electron microscopy. The blend membrane exhibited high conductivity of 0.17 × 10−3 to 1.01 × 10−3 S cm−1 and an outstanding lithium ion transference number of 0.898-0.936. A half-cell using LiFePO4 and the blend membrane exhibited discharge capacities (0.2C) of 121.7 and 152.7 mA h g−1 at 25 and 60 °C, respectively.

TiO2 nanocrystals embedded in sulfur-doped porous carbon as high-performance and long-lasting anode materials for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.TiO2 is now developed as a low-cost and high-safety anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but its low sodium ion diffusion ability and poor electrical conductivity hinder its sodium-storage performance. In this work, TiO2 nanocrystals embedded in sulfur-doped porous carbon (TSPC) were synthesized through the solvothermal synthesis of a metal-organic framework MIL-125(Ti) precursor and subsequent pyrolysis with inorganic sulfur powder under a nitrogen atmosphere. The inner TiO2 nanocrystals enlarge the electrode/electrolyte interface and shorten the diffusion distance of sodium ions, while the sulfur-doped porous carbon enhances the electron transport ability, inhibits the aggregation of TiO2 nanocrystals, and offers more reaction sites for sodium storage. Benefiting from the synergetic effects between TiO2 nanocrystals and sulfur-doped porous carbon, when used as the anode material for SIBs, the TSPC demonstrates an ultrahigh specific capacity of 323 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 50 mA g-1 and extraordinary cycling stability with a capacity retention of 80.1% after 1500 cycles. The TSPC should be a promising anode material for high-performance SIBs.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Metal-based nanostructured materials for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Since the resurgence of interest in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries at the end of the 2000s, research in the field has grown rapidly. Li-S batteries hold great promise as the upcoming post-lithium-ion batteries owing to their notably high theoretical specific energy density of 2600 W h kg−1, nearly five-fold larger than that of current lithium-ion batteries. However, one of their major technical problems is found in the shuttling of soluble polysulfides between the electrodes, resulting in rapid capacity fading and poor cycling stability. This review spotlights the foremost findings and the recent progress in enhancing the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries by using nanoscaled metal compounds and metals. Based on an overview of reported functional metal-based materials and their specific employment in certain parts of Li-S batteries, the underlying mechanisms of enhanced adsorption and improved reaction kinetics are critically discussed involving both experimental and computational research findings. Thus, material design principles and possible interdisciplinary research approaches providing the chance to jointly advance with related fields such as electrocatalysis are identified. Particularly, we elucidate additives, sulfur hosts, current collectors and functional interlayers/hybrid separators containing metal oxides, hydroxides and sulfides as well as metal-organic frameworks, bare metal and further metal nitrides, metal carbides and MXenes. Throughout this review article, we emphasize the close relationship between the intrinsic properties of metal-based nanostructured materials, the (electro)chemical interaction with lithium (poly)sulfides and the subsequent effect on the battery performance. Concluding the review, prospects for the future development of practical Li-S batteries with metal-based nanomaterials are discussed.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Impact of surface wettability on dynamics of supercooled water confined in nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon,"© 2018 the Owner Societies.Confinement of water to nanoscale dimensions enables substantial supercooling through disruption of the hydrogen bonding network. However, there remain questions associated with the importance of the nature of the water-surface interactions relative to physical confinement defined by the pore geometry on the dynamics of supercooled water. Here, a simple route to tune the surface wetting properties through nitrogen doping of carbon is reported. This method leads to nearly indistinguishable mesopore sizes to enable separation of surface wettability and pore size effects. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) is used to probe the proton dynamics of water confined within the mesopores with an average diameter of 4.85 ± 0.05 nm as a function of temperature from 267 K to 189 K. The motions of water in the mesopores follow jump-diffusion. For the temperatures examined, the diffusivity of water in the mesopores decreases with increasing nitrogen doping of the carbon framework. The activation energy associated with proton dynamics increases by approximately 30% with N-doping when compared to the undoped carbon surface, which is attributed to the enhanced surface wettability (favorable interactions between water and pore surface). This acts to provide an energy barrier for the water motions. This work suggests that the influence of surface chemistry on the dynamics of supercooled water confined in mesopores is less than the influence of nanopore size.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Efficient polysulfide barrier of a graphene aerogel-carbon nanofibers-Ni network for high-energy-density lithium-sulfur batteries with ultrahigh sulfur content,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Low sulfur loading and content, as well as severe shuttle effects, remain the key issues for the application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, resulting in a low areal capacity and fast capacity fade. Herein, a highly efficient conductive network is developed by growing herringbone structured carbon nanofibers (CNFs) on the surface of graphene aerogel (GA-CNFs-Ni) and is further applied as a functional coating layer in Li-S batteries. The conductive coating layer, serves as both a shield to trap the active materials detached from the cathode and a conductive “second current collector” to reactivate the trapped active materials. The herringbone structured CNFs enriched with defects and gaps enlarge the available reaction site for electrons, the electrolyte and sulfur species, ensuring the smooth operation of the sulfur cathode with high loading and high content. In addition, the uniformly distributed Ni nanoparticles also exert strong chemical bonding with polysulfides by first-principle calculations. Consequently, the GA-CNFs-Ni coated separator enables the “double high” sulfur cathode (5 mg cm−2, 90 wt%) to display an ultrastable cycle capability and superior rate performance. Moreover, a high sulfur loading of 10 mg cm−2 and a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio (6 μL mg−1) are obtained, delivering a high areal capacity of 5.5 mA h cm−2 after 60 cycles.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

Enhanced storage ability by using a porous pyrrhotite@N-doped carbon yolk-shell structure as an advanced anode material for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are undoubtedly the most promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries considering the natural abundance, distribution and cost of sodium resources. Still, SIBs face challenges in the development of suitable anode materials due to the large volume change during sodiation/de-sodiation, which results in inferior cycling stability. Herein, we synthesized a yolk-shell structured pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS)@N-doped carbon (FS@NC) through a solution-based method and investigated its electrochemical properties for use in SIBs as an anode material. The optimized yolk-shell structured FS@NC with distinctive voids and a core exhibited a high reversible capacity of 594 mA h g-1 over 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1, excellent rate capability and superior cycling performance compared to core-shell and pristine Fe1-xS materials. During the charge and discharge cycles, the synergistic effect of the porous core (Fe1-xS) with empty voids and a defective carbon shell configuration provided a large electrode/electrolyte contact area and shortened the diffusion path for electrons and sodium ions. It also mitigated the structural degradation by accommodating the volume change during continuous cycles, which was confirmed by ex situ SEM and TEM analyses. To demonstrate a practical application, we assembled a sodium-ion full cell with an O3-type NaCo0.5Fe0.5O2 cathode and a yolk-shell structured FS@NC anode, and the results showed superior energy storage performance.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Reliable seawater battery anode: Controlled sodium nucleation: Via deactivation of the current collector surface,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Seawater battery, which consists of a Na metal anode and a seawater cathode, has highly attractive features because of its eco-friendliness in use of seawater and cost-effectiveness in the use of Na, the 6th most abundant element of the Earth's crust. Herein, we demonstrate a reliable Na metal anode for the seawater battery by covering the Cu current collector with a graphene monolayer. The surface of the chemically uniform graphene-coated current collector facilitates control of the nucleation rate of surficial Na metal at the initial stage and enhances the coulombic efficiency in current collectorseparatorNa metal cells by lowering the nucleation and plating potentials. Further deliberate modification of the graphene surface by using O2 plasma and thermal treatments supports the significance of the homogeneity of the interface of the current collector. Problematically, heterogeneous Cu surfaces covered with islands of oxide layers significantly altered the surface morphology of plated Na metal and consequently resulted in the decrease in electrochemical performance due to the impeding effect on Na ion diffusion near the current collector surface. Through successful implantation of the graphene-coated Cu current collector as an anode in the seawater battery, the battery performance drastically improved, which was confirmed by monitoring the discharge/charge performance and durability of LED lighting.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Decorating β′′-alumina solid-state electrolytes with micron Pb spherical particles for improving Na wettability at lower temperatures,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Overcoming poor physical contact is one of the most critical hurdles for batteries using solid-state electrolytes. In particular, overpotential from the liquid-solid interface between molten sodium and a β′′-alumina solid-state electrolyte (BASE) in a sodium-metal halide (Na-MH) battery could be enormous at lower operating temperatures (<200 °C) due to intrinsically poor Na wetting on the BASE surface. In this work, we describe how surface modification with lead acetate trihydrate (LAT) at different temperatures affects Na wetting on BASEs. LAT treatment conducted at a temperature of 400 °C (under a nitrogen gas atmosphere) shows significantly better Na wettability and battery performance than treatments at lower temperatures. The formation of a unique morphology - micron-sized Pb spherical particles - is observed on the surface of the BASE LAT treated at 400 °C. We also observed evolution of the Na wetting configuration from a Cassie drop, to a Wenzel drop, and finally to a sunny-side-up drop, which is clearly different from the Young-Dupré relation, with increasing the contact-angle measurement temperature. We conclude that formation of a thin Na penetrating film (sunny-side-up shape) on Pb-decorated BASEs is crucial for achieving good battery performance at lower operating temperatures. The new observations and fundamental understanding of Na wetting reported here will provide excellent guidance for improving cell performance in general and will further promote development of practical Na-MH battery technologies for large-scale energy storage applications.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

Inverse-vulcanization of vinyl functionalized covalent organic frameworks as efficient cathode materials for Li-S batteries,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging class of crystalline porous materials featuring pre-designable structures and tailor-made functions. Herein, a mesoporous imine COF with densely arranged reactive vinyl groups (COF-V) was inverse-vulcanized with sulfur and used as a cathode material for Li-S batteries. Owing to the synergetic chemical covalent binding with the vinyl groups and physical confinement by the mesoporous channels, the shuttle effect of polysulfides could be efficiently suppressed. As a result, the inverse-vulcanized S-COF-V cathode demonstrated a high initial capacity of 1400 mA h g-1 which retained 959 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.2C and can be further cycled 1000 times at 1C with a low fading rate of 0.057% per cycle. These results are among the best performances of reported COF-based sulfur cathodes. Our findings provide a new approach to develop efficient cathode materials for Li-S batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Marcasite iron sulfide as a high-capacity electrode material for sodium storage,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Iron sulfides have attracted significant attention as promising electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their low electronegativity, high theoretical capacity, and cost-effectiveness. However, the large size of sodium ions generally induces severe volume changes and sluggish sodium kinetics in iron sulfide electrodes, which have prevented their practical application in SIBs. Herein, an orthorhombic marcasite FeS2 was successfully synthesized under solvothermal conditions and subsequently modified using electro-conductive carbon. This report is the first to use marcasite FeS2 as an electrode material in Na cells. The FeS2/carbon composite exhibited a high Na-storage capacity with stable capacity retention in Na cells; specifically, a discharge capacity of 385 mA h g-1 (over 85% of the initial capacity) was retained after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1. The following related Na-storage mechanism was proposed: FeS2 + 2Na+ + 2e- → FeS + Na2S on sodiation (reduction), and this reaction occurs reversibly on desodiation (oxidation). The FeS2 cathode in the Na cells delivered a high energy density of approximately 620 W h kg-1 even after 200 cycles, which is comparable to that of commercial cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Enhancing sodium ionic conductivity in tetragonal-Na3PS4 by halogen doping: A first principles investigation,"© 2018 the Owner Societies.Tetragonal Na3PS4 (t-Na3PS4) has been demonstrated as a very promising candidate for a solid-state sodium-ion electrolyte with high Na ionic conductivity at ambient temperature. In this paper, we systematically investigated the Na ionic conductivity in pristine and halogen (F, Cl, Br, and I) doped tetragonal-Na3PS4 superionic conductors using first-principles calculations. The Na ionic conductivity of pristine t-Na3PS4 is calculated to be about 0.01 mS cm-1, while much higher Na ionic conductivities could be achieved by introducing Na ion vacancies via a halogen doping strategy. The calculated Na ionic conductivity of t-Na3PS4 doped with 1.56% Cl is 1.07 mS cm-1 at ambient temperature. Among different halogen-doped t-Na3PS4, Br-doped t-Na3PS4 shows the lowest activation energy and the highest Na ionic conductivity, which reaches 2.37 mS cm-1 at 300 K. The low activation energy and high Na ionic conductivity in Br-doped t-Na3PS4 are due to a relatively lower defect binding energy of the defect pair of halogen substitution and a Na ion vacancy. Our results suggest Br-doped t-Na3PS4 may serve as a very promising Na-ion solid-state superionic conductor.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Curving effects of concave dodecahedral nanocarbons enable enhanced Li-ion storage,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Dodecahedral nanocarbons with highly curving concave faces are synthesized via a one-step direct pyrolysis strategy. When tested as anodes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the concave dodecahedral carbons (CDCs) show much enhanced capacity (∼2 times) and improved rate capability (603 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1), when compared with the perfect ones without curved planes (PDCs, 280 mA h g-1). The curving effects of CDCs on Li ion storage are further investigated by constructing a CDC particle-based nanobattery device in an in situ transmission electron microscope (TEM). During the lithiation process of CDCs, the spacing in the curved parts expands much more than the perfect ones (from 0.5 nm to 0.7 nm), providing increasing active sites for Li ion storage. And the stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and structural integrity for CDCs are also visualized during the discharge process, in good agreement with their ultralong cycle life. This design concept, enhancing curved parts in the structures, provides guidance in the development of next-generation advanced electrode materials.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Red blood cell-like hollow carbon sphere anchored ultrathin Na2Ti3O7 nanosheets as long cycling and high rate-performance anodes for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) has been proved to be a potential anode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, its poor rate capability and low electrical conductivity has seriously hindered its application. Therefore, a unique red blood cell-like hollow carbon sphere supported Na2Ti3O7 sodium titanate nanosheet structure (Na2Ti3O7@RHCS) was designed here, which can both improve the electrical conductivity and preserve the structural stability, thus obtaining high rate performance. In addition, the red blood cell-like spherical structure can greatly increase the compacted density via a dense packing mode just like red blood cells stacked together one by one. Meanwhile, the ultrathin nanosheet-like morphology of Na2Ti3O7 could further increase the number of active reaction sites and reduce the diffusion path of sodium ions during the charge-discharge process. This well-designed material exhibits a good cycling performance: a reversible capacity of 110.46 mA h g-1 at 5C and 45.71 mA h g-1 at 50C.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Superionically conducting β′′-Al2O3 thin films processed using flame synthesized nanopowders,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Commercial β′′-Al2O3 solid electrolytes for Na+ batteries are exclusively produced in tubular form, in part, due to processing difficulties. High sintering temperatures combined with Na2O loss and excessive grain growth complicate processing of β′′-Al2O3 thin films (<100 μm) which could potentially reduce cell resistance, increase energy density, and even permit room temperature operations. In this study, we use high surface area flame made nanopowders at selected compositions to drive densification to produce β′′-Al2O3 thin films with controlled microstructures and Na2O loss to maintain a high β′′-Al2O3 fraction. We show that addition of TiO2 and ZrO2 dramatically enhances the sintering kinetics, resulting in dense (>95%), thin (≤50 μm) β′′-Al2O3 films at the lowest sintering temperature ever reported (1320 °C/2 h). The sintered films also offer superionic conductivity (>1 mS cm-1) at room temperature. Symmetrical cell (Na/β′′-Al2O3/Na) testing further comfirms its potential utility in Na batteries using β′′-Al2O3 solid electrolytes.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Disordered carbon tubes based on cotton cloth for modulating interface impedance in β′′-Al2O3-based solid-state sodium metal batteries,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Owing to the high interfacial resistance between a solid electrolyte and sodium metal anode, the development of solid-state sodium batteries is greatly limited. In this work, the introduction of the coating layer composed of micro-sized and cotton-cloth-derived disordered carbon tubes (DCTs) on the surface of the β′′-Al2O3 solid electrolyte (BASE) reduces the interfacial resistance. Better wetting of the DCT modified BASE by sodium results in uniform and rapid Na ion transport across the interface, which significantly reduces the interfacial resistance from 750 Ω cm-2 to 150 Ω cm-2 and presents stable Na stripping/plating profiles at a temperature of 58 °C. Solid-state sodium batteries with a sodium anode, DCT-BASE, and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) gel composite cathode are successfully operated at 58 °C, and deliver good cycling performance and high efficiency. In addition, the self-supported DCT electrode material is proved to have reversible, stable, and rapid Na ion insertion/extraction ability in NIBs.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

In this feature article, we describe the history of the development of lithium metal batteries and their existing key challenges, which include non-uniform electrodeposition, volume expansion, high reactivity of the lithium metal/unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and the shuttling of active cathode materials. Then, we focus on the growth mechanisms of uneven lithium electrodeposition and extend the discussion to the approaches to inhibit lithium dendrites. Finally, we discuss future directions that are expected to drive progress in the development of lithium metal batteries.",Chemical Communications

An ionic liquid based sodium metal-hybrid supercapacitor-battery,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry. There is growing interest in developing sodium based energy storage devices as alternatives to Li for large-scale energy storage. We report a highly stable hybrid system comprising a sodium metal anode, a highly porous N/S co-doped mesoporous carbon cathode and the non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte N-propyl-N-methyl pyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (C 3 mpyrFSI). This hybrid device operates at 100% coulombic efficiency and shows almost complete capacity retention over 3000 cycles. Owing to the reversible cathode reactions between Na + and N/S functionalities on the carbon surface, a very high capacity of 716 mA h g -1 (at a rate of C/16) was achieved between 3.8 V and 0.005 V vs. Na + /Na. An optimised device could provide energy density as high as 263 W h kg -1 . At high rate, the devices achieved power density of 1463 W kg -1 . These metrics increase to 270 W h kg -1 and 3822 W kg -1 at 50 °C, highlighting the excellent combination of a supercapacitor-type cathode with a sodium metal anode and an ionic liquid electrolyte for large-scale energy storage.",Sustainable Energy and Fuels

"Symmetric lithium sulfide – Sulfur cells: A method to study degradation mechanisms of cathode, separator and electrolyte concepts for lithium-sulfur batteries","© 2018 The Electrochemical Society.Novel cathode, electrolyte and separator concepts are expected to improve the capacity retention and cycle life of lithium-sulfur batteries by avoiding the dissolution of polysulfide-intermediates into the electrolyte or preventing their diffusion to and reaction with the lithium metal anode. However, their intrinsic evaluation is obscured by ill-defined degradation mechanisms of the lithium counter electrode due to electrolyte and polysulfide consumption during reformation of the solid electrolyte interface. Herein, we introduce symmetric lithium sulfide – sulfur cells to study the “cathode"" specific degradation mechanisms of the cathode/electrolyte/separator-system in order to differentiate cathode-, separator, and electrolyte and lithium metal anode degradation. Two identical carbon/sulfur-composite cathodes, either of them one at first lithiated versus lithium, are assembled in a coin cell versus each other. The virtue of this test cell design is demonstrated evaluating prime shuttle-suppression concepts, namely a Nafion-coated polyolefin separator and a sparingly polysulfide-solvating electrolyte. We conclude that symmetric lithium sulfide – sulfur cells provide a valuable methodology to analyze the intrinsic capacity decay and cycle life of cathodes for lithium-sulfur cells with limited solvation and/or blocking of polysulfides, and it is an essential strategy to distinguish cathode from lithium anode degradation.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society

Nevertheless, the lower energy density and limited cycling life of SIBs are still the main challenges impeding their wide application. Tremendous work has been done on anode materials for SIBs, and rational structural design is considered as an effective way to enhance their electrochemical performance.

Enhanced photoconductivity in CdS/betanin composite nanostructures,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Development of novel materials for thin film solar cells are gaining significant attention due to their tunable wide bandgap and extensive application potential in flexible energy harvesters. CdS is a known window material for thin film solar cells. Tuning of the photoconductivity of CdS by doping, substitution and grain size tailoring is widely attempted by researchers. Inorganic core/shell structures like CdS/CdSe, CdS/ZnS etc. are other possible candidates with band gap tailorability. However, such attempts are rare in tailoring the photoconductivity by providing an organic shell over the inorganic core. Here the authors synthesised CdS/betanin core/shell structures using wet chemical routes. Spectroscopic studies show that the composite structure is core/shell like, with CdS as the core and betanin (a natural dye), as the outer shell with an average core particle size of 10 nm. The absorption spectra of the composite system show the signature of an additional band in the lower wavelength region and it is redshifted with increase in betanin percentage. The intermediate band observed in the energy of ∼1.75 eV, helps CdS to enhance the rate of absorption. Simultaneous absorbance of lower and higher energy photons from the solar radiation can increase the efficiency of CdS based solar cells. A huge enhancement in conductivity is observed in CdS/betanin composites on illumination with white light due to the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of betanin dye to the conduction band of CdS.",RSC Advances
Comparative Study of Special Features of the Oxygen Reaction (Molecular Oxygen Ionization and Evolution) in Aqueous and Nonaqueous Electrolyte Solutions (a Review),"© 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.Studies of the oxygen reaction, including the oxygen ionization and evolution processes occurring at typical electrode materials in aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes, are analyzed. A connection between the problematics of the oxygen electrode reaction in nonaqueous media and the developing of novel batteries, in the first place, Li–O2 batteries, is emphasized. Unlike aqueous solutions, the oxygen reduction in aprotic electrolytes was shown to occur without breaking of the O–O bond; it is accompanied by formation of poorly soluble product of two-electron reaction (Li2O2) in the pores of positive electrode. The effect of the solvent donor number and the anion composition on the oxygen reduction mechanism and the lithium peroxide deposit structure is described. A marked reduction of the Li2O2 oxidation overvoltage when passing from carbonaceous materials to platinum-containing catalysts in the positive electrode is elucidated; in the latter case, the effect of electrocatalyst type upon the Li2O2 formation reaction is somewhat reduced. The elucidation of the contribution of processes occurring at the free and lithium-peroxide-covered electrode surface during the oxygen reaction for wide variety of active materials is formulated as the main basic problem of the future research.",Russian Journal of Electrochemistry
Improving the cycling stability of lithium-sulfur batteries by hollow dual-shell coating,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Herein, a novel hybrid S@MnO2@C nanosphere, comprising sulfur nanoparticles encapsulated by a MnO2@C hollow dual-shell, is reported. Benefiting from a conductive C outer layer, the S@MnO2@C hybrid nanosphere provided highly efficient pathways for fast electron/ion transfer and sufficient free space for the expansion of the encapsulated sulfur nanoparticles. Moreover, the dual-shell composed of a MnO2 inner layer and a C outer layer coating on S not only improved the efficacious encapsulation of sulfur, but also significantly suppressed the dissolution of polysulfides during cycling. As a result, the S@MnO2@C electrode shows high capacity, high coulombic efficiency and excellent cycling stability. The S@MnO2@C cathode delivered a discharge capacity of 593 mA h g-1 in the fourth cycle and was able to maintain 573 mA h g-1 after 100 charge-discharge cycles at 1.0C, corresponding to a capacity retention of 96.6%.",RSC Advances
Differences in electrochemistry between fibrous SPAN and fibrous S/C cathodes relevant to cycle stability and capacity,"© The Author(s) 2017.Two different Li/S cathodes are compared in terms of capacity (mA.h.gsulfur-1 ) and intermediates during discharge and charge. One cathode material is based on fibrous SPAN, a sulfur-containing material obtained via the thermal conversion of poly(acrylonitrile), PAN, in the presence of sulfur. In this material, sulfur is covalently bound to the polymeric backbone. The second cathode material is based on porous activated carbon fibers (ACFs) with elemental sulfur embedded inside the ACFs' micropores. Cyclic voltammetry clearly indicates different discharge and charge chemistry of the two materials. While S-containing ACFs show the expected redoxchemistry of sulfur, SPAN does not form long-chain polysulfides during discharge; instead, sulfide is chopped off the polymer-bound sulfur chains to directly form Li2S. The high reversibility of this process accounts for both the high cycle stability and capacity of SPAN-based cathode materials.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society

Innovation and challenges in materials design for flexible rechargeable batteries: From 1D to 3D,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Due to the emergence of numerous flexible electronic devices, the design and fabrication of flexible power sources with high energy density have attracted great attention in the field. Among various energy storage technologies, flexible rechargeable batteries are the most promising, because of their unique features including high flexibility, high specific energy density, light weight properties, etc. To achieve the flexible battery concept, the flexibility of each component is considered a key property in addition to required electrochemical capacity and stability. In this review, recent advances in different kinds of flexible rechargeable batteries are discussed, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, lithium-air (Li-air) batteries, zinc-air batteries (ZABs), and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Based on the macro-shapes and micro-structures, flexible batteries are outlined into one-, two-, and three-dimensional. Further, sub-classification is performed within each type according to the role of materials in various batteries such as anodes, cathodes, electrolytes, and other components. It is important to note that the design for flexibility is also influenced by the assembly process of all of material components. Thus, this review focuses not only on the selection and preparation of battery materials, but also on the complete battery assembly process. Since some experimental data for flexible batteries are still limited by today's technology, performance simulations have also been included to predict and describe the battery performance. Finally, key challenges and perspectives for advanced flexible battery technologies are provided as general guidance for future research.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Facile synthesis of high-surface-Area nanoporous carbon from biomass resources and its application in supercapacitors,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.It is critical for nanoporous carbons to have a large surface area, and low cost and be readily available for challenging energy and environmental issues. The pursuit of all three characteristics, particularly large surface area, is a formidable challenge because traditional methods to produce porous carbon materials with a high surface area are complicated and expensive, frequently resulting in pollution (commonly from the activation process). Here we report a facile method to synthesize nanoporous carbon materials with a high surface area of up to 1234 m2 g-1 and an average pore diameter of 0.88 nm through a simple carbonization procedure with carefully selected carbon precursors (biomass material) and carbonization conditions. It is the high surface area that leads to a high capacitance (up to 213 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) and a stable cycle performance (6.6% loss over 12000 cycles) as shown in a three-electrode cell. Furthermore, the high capacitance (107 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) can be obtained in a supercapacitor device. This facile approach may open a door for the preparation of high surface area porous carbons for energy storage.",RSC Advances
Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Sulfur Cathode during Discharge in MgTFSI2–DME Electrolyte,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRechargeable magnesium/sulfur battery is of significant interest because its energy density (1700 Wh kg−1 and 3200 Wh L−1) is among the highest of all battery chemistries (lower than Li/O2 and Mg/O2 but comparable to Li/S), and Mg metal allows reversible operation (100% Coulombic efficiency) with no dendrite formation. This great promise is already justified in some early reports. However, lack of mechanistic study of sulfur reaction in the Mg cation environment has severely hindered our understanding and prevents effective measures for performance improvement. In this work, the very first systematic fundamental study on Mg/S system is conducted by combining experimental methods with computational approach. The thermodynamics and reaction pathway of sulfur cathode in MgTFSI2–DME electrolyte, as well as the associated kinetics are thoroughly investigated. The results here reveal that sulfur undergoes a consecutive staging pathway in which the formation and chain-shortening of polysulfide occur at early stage accompanied by the dissolution of long-chain polysulfide, and solid-state transition from short-chain polysulfide to magnesium sulfide occurs at late stage. The former process is much faster than the latter due to the synergetic effect of the mediating effect of dissolved polysulfide and the fast diffusion of Mg ion in the amorphous intermediate.",Advanced Materials
Graphene Oxide-Supported β-Tin Telluride Composite for Sodium- and Lithium-Ion Battery Anodes,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimHigh-charge-capacity sodium- and lithium-ion battery anodes based on tin telluride are reported for the first time. Graphene oxide/cubic β-SnTe electrodes exhibit exceptionally high reversible volumetric charge capacities above 3000 and 1300 mAh cm−3 at 100 mA g−1 charging rate for lithium and sodium ion batteries, respectively, and they show very good rate capabilities retaining 68 and 60 % of the respective capacities even at 2000 mA g−1 charging rate. The reversible charge capacity for lithiation is approximately equal to the theoretical value of the active material. The superior electrode performance is attributed to the high conductivity of tellurium, the mechanical buffering of volume changes by the large row-V host elements, the elasticity of the reduced graphene oxide support, and the very low specific equivalent volumes involved in sodiation and lithiation of SnTe.",Energy Technology
Nickel-Substituted Copper Hexacyanoferrate as a Superior Cathode for Aqueous Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimCopper-based hexacyanoferrates have received important interest as cathode candidates for aqueous sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), owing to the room-temperature synthesis route, fast reaction kinetics, and high working potential. However, they suffer from insufficient cycling performance in medium aqueous electrolytes. Herein, a nickel-substituted copper hexacyanoferrate (Na2Cu0.6Ni0.4[Fe(CN)6]) is reported as a superior cathode for aqueous SIBs, which is developed by studying the effect of Ni substitution on the electrochemical properties of Na2Cu1-xNix[Fe(CN)6] (0≤x≤1) series. It exhibits a reversible capacity of 62 mAh g−1 and an average working potential of 0.62 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a current rate of 0.5 C. Even though being cycled at a high current rate of 10 C, it can achieve a discharge capacity of 56 mAh g−1 and render a capacity retention of 96 % after 1000 cycles. Relative to most previously reported cathode materials, the material shows superior overall performance including improved specific energy, outstanding high-rate capability, and excellent cycling performance. This indicates that Na2Cu0.6Ni0.4[Fe(CN)6] is a promising cathode candidate for aqueous SIBs.",ChemElectroChem
Molecular simulations of electrolyte structure and dynamics in lithium–sulfur battery solvents,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.The performance of modern lithium-sulfur (Li/S) battery systems critically depends on the electrolyte and solvent compositions. For fundamental molecular insights and rational guidance of experimental developments, efficient and sufficiently accurate molecular simulations are thus in urgent need.

We benchmark and verify our simulations by comparing structural and dynamic features with various available experimental reference systems and demonstrate their applicability for a wide range of electrolyte–solvent compositions. For the state-of-the-art battery solvent, we finally calculate and discuss the detailed composition of the first lithium solvation shell, the temperature dependence of lithium diffusion, as well as the electrolyte conductivities and lithium transference numbers. Our model will serve as a basis for efficient future predictions of electrolyte structure and transport in complex electrode confinements for the optimization of modern Li/S batteries (and related devices).",Journal of Power Sources

Fe7Se8 nanoparticles encapsulated by nitrogen-doped carbon with high sodium storage performance and evolving redox reactions,"© 2017We demonstrate the availability of Fe7Se8 as anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) for the first time. A Fe7Se8 nanocomposite encapsulated by nitrogen-doped carbon layers (Fe7Se8@NC) has been fabricated via a facile thermal method using Prussian Blue as precursor, and its sodium storage mechanisms and extraordinary activation process during cycling are revealed for comprehensive understanding of its reaction process. It shows that the sodium storage mechanisms of Fe7Se8 can be affected by the activation process, especially in the charge process.

Even at 2000 mA g−1, the capacity can retain 251 mAh g−1. Moreover, the Fe7Se8@NC shows excellent cyclability, which maintains the capacity up to 339 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 after 1200 cycles. The results demonstrate that Fe7Se8@NC is a promising anode material for SIBs.",Energy Storage Materials
In situ synthesis of iron sulfide embedded porous carbon hollow spheres for sodium ion batteries,"© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Iron sulfide embedded porous carbon hollow spheres (FeSx@CS) have been successfully synthesized through a facile and environment friendly in situ synthetic method. Using this method, a porous carbon matrix and uniformly dispersed iron sulfide nanoparticles were formed simultaneously and assembled into hollow spheres.

Suppressing Shuttle Effect Using Janus Cation Exchange Membrane for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Battery Separator,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfide ions to obtain high durability and good electrochemical performance is of great concern in the field of lithium-sulfur batteries. To address this issue, a Janus membrane consisting of an ultrathin dense layer and a robust microporous layer is fabricated using cation exchange resin. Different from the composite membranes made from polyolefin membranes, the multiple layers of the Janus membrane in this study are synchronously generated by one step, getting rid of the additional complex coating processes. Excellent overall performance is obtained by the cooperation of multiple factors. The excellent ionic selectivity of cation exchange resin renders a great suppression of the shuttle effect, endowing the lithium-sulfur battery with high Coulombic efficiency of 92.0-99.0% (LiNO3-free electrolyte). The ultrathin property of a dense layer renders a low ionic resistance, resulting in 60% higher discharge capacity over the entire C-rates (versus the control sample with Celgard 2400 membrane). The robust macroporous layer supports the ultrathin layer to achieve a free-standing property, ensuring the usability of the Janus membrane.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Challenges and Perspectives for NASICON-Type Electrode Materials for Advanced Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted increasing attention in the past decades, because of high overall abundance of precursors, their even geographical distribution, and low cost. Apart from inherent thermodynamic disadvantages, SIBs have to overcome multiple kinetic problems, such as fast capacity decay, low rate capacities and low Coulombic efficiencies. A special case is sodium super ion conductor (NASICON)-based electrode materials as they exhibit – besides pronounced structural stability – exceptionally high ion conductivity, rendering them most promising for sodium storage. Owing to the limiting, comparatively low electronic conductivity, nano-structuring is a prerequisite for achieving satisfactory rate-capability. In this review, we analyze advantages and disadvantages of NASICON-type electrode materials and highlight electrode structure design principles for obtaining the desired electrochemical performance. Moreover, we give an overview of recent approaches to enhance electrical conductivity and structural stability of cathode and anode materials based on NASICON structure. We believe that this review provides a pertinent insight into relevant design principles and inspires further research in this respect.",Advanced Materials
Cobalt Sulfide Quantum Dot Embedded N/S-Doped Carbon Nanosheets with Superior Reversibility and Rate Capability for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Metal sulfides are promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to their large specific capacities. The practical applications of metal sulfides in sodium-ion batteries, however, are still limited due to their large volume expansion, poor cycling stability, and sluggish electrode kinetics. In this work, a two-dimensional heterostructure of CoSx (CoS and Co9S8) quantum dots embedded N/S-doped carbon nanosheets (CoSx@NSC) is prepared by a sol-gel method. The CoSx quantum dots are in situ formed within ultrafine carbon nanosheets without further sulfidation, thus resulting in ultrafine CoSx particle size and embedded heterostructure. Meanwhile, enriched N and S codoping in the carbon nanosheets greatly enhances the electrical conductivity for the conductive matrix and creates more active sites for sodium storage. As a result, the hybrid CoSx@NSC electrode shows excellent rate capability (600 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and 500 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1) and outstanding cycling stability (87% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 A g-1), making it promising as an anode material for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. A CoSx@NSC//Na0.44MnO2 full cell is demonstrated, and it can deliver a specific capacity of 414 mAh g-1 (based on the mass of CoSx@NSC) at a current density of 0.2 A g-1.",ACS Nano
Electrochemical Properties and Redox Mechanism of Na2Ni0.4Co0.6[Fe(CN)6] Nanocrystallites as High-Capacity Cathode for Aqueous Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Nickel-based ferrocyanides have attracted wide interest as cathode for aqueous sodium-ion batteries in fields of sustainable energies such as wind and solar, owing to excellent cycling stability and high-rate capability. However, they suffer from low specific capacities (∼60 mAh g-1). Herein, Na2Ni0.4Co0.6[Fe(CN)6] nanocrystallites are reported for the first time as high-capacity cathode for aqueous sodium-ion batteries. Its electrochemical properties and redox mechanism have been understood by combining the X-ray diffraction technique, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance microscopy, and charge/discharge measurements. It is revealed that the material undergoes a reversible three-step single-phase reaction mechanism during Na extraction through sequential electrochemical oxidation of nitrogen-coordinated Co2+ ions and carbon-coordinated Fe2+ ions and achieves superior electrochemical performance with a high reversible capacity of 85 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C, an average operating potential of 0.62 V (vs Ag/AgCl), and a high capacity retention of 90% after 100 cycles.

Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries: A Comprehensive Review on Research Progress and Cell Chemistry,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRoom temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries have recently regained a great deal of attention due to their high theoretical energy density and low cost, which make them promising candidates for application in large-scale energy storage, especially in stationary energy storage, such as with electrical grids. Research on this system is currently in its infancy, and it is encountering severe challenges in terms of low electroactivity, limited cycle life, and serious self-charging. Moreover, the reaction mechanism of S with Na ions varies with the electrolyte that is applied, and is very complicated and hard to detect due to the multi-step reactions and the formation of various polysulfides. Therefore, understanding the chemistry and optimizing the nanostructure of electrodes for RT-Na/S batteries are critical for their advancement and practical application in the future. In the present review, the electrochemical reactions between Na and S are reviewed, as well as recent progress on the crucial cathode materials. Furthermore, attention also is paid to electrolytes, separators, and cell configuration. Additionally, current challenges and future perspectives for the RT-Na/S batteries are discussed, and potential research directions toward improving RT-Na/S cells are proposed at the end.",Advanced Energy Materials
Self-Healing Chemistry between Organic Material and Binder for Stable Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2017 Elsevier Inc.One of the major challenges for high-energy sodium-ion batteries is the mechanical fracture triggered by large volume change. To circumvent pulverization-induced capacity decay, self-healing chemistry between binder and active material is critical but is never reported. Here, we report a self-healing electrode with hydrogen bonding between an oxygen-rich active material, sodium rhodizonate dibasic (SRD), and a hydroxyl-rich binder, sodium alginate (SA). During the sodiation of microsized SRD, cracks induced by volume expansion expose a new oxygen-rich surface, whereas the SA binder fills these cracks under pressure generated by volume expansion and binds the pulverized SRD together by hydrogen bonding between SRD and SA. Self-healing between hydroxyl-rich binder and oxygen-rich active material is a universal strategy for mitigating the pulverization-induced capacity decay of active materials, as demonstrated by the longer cycle life of the SRD electrode with other hydroxyl-rich binders, polyacrylic acid, and xanthan gum than with hydroxyl-free polytetrafluoroethylene binder. Self-healing between binder and active material is a promising strategy for overcoming the pulverization-induced capacity decay of high-capacity electrodes in Na-ion batteries. It requires the binder to have strong and reversible chemical bonding with the active material. Here, we report a hydrogen-bonding-based self-healing electrode consisting of a hydroxyl-rich sodium alginate binder and an oxygen-rich sodium rhodizonate dibasic active material. The strong and reversible chemical bonding between the binder and active material and the high pressure induced by large volume expansion drive the binder to fill the cracks induced by pulverization and self-heal these cracks upon cycling. The concept of self-healing between active material and binder in Na-ion batteries can be extended to other rechargeable batteries, thus providing an opportunity to develop high-energy batteries. Self-healing chemistry based on hydrogen bonding between a hydroxyl-rich binder and an oxygen-rich active material was developed for stable Na-ion batteries. The strong chemical bonding between the binder and active material self-heals the cracks of active material upon cycling, resulting in outstanding cycling stability. This self-healing strategy is promising for developing high-energy and high-stability rechargeable batteries.",Chem
"Atomic Sulfur Anchored on Silicene, Phosphorene, and Borophene for Excellent Cycle Performance of Li-S Batteries","© 2017 American Chemical Society.Dissolution of intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS) is an inevitable obstacle for the solid sulfur-based cathode in Li-S batteries. For the first time, herein, atomic sulfur is incorporated into silicene, phosphorene, and borophene to intrinsically eliminate the dissolution of LiPS. The small molecular sulfur species are anchored on the silicene surface with stronger Si-S interaction than the P-S and B-S ones. Meanwhile, a high atomic sulfur coverage (63.1 wt %) is achieved in silicene and concomitantly stabilizes the silicene layer. For the S3-covered silicene, a high theoretical capacity of 857 mA h g-1 is achieved with slight dissolution of LiPS originated from the loss of interior S atoms that are not directly bound with silicene surface. By realizing the elemental S2 coverage on silicene with large surface area, the Li+ ions can react fast with the S2 species, leading to a high theoretical capacity of 891 mA h g-1 without dissolution and migration of the intermediate LiPS. Most interestingly, the discharge products of atomic layer of lithium sulfides on silicene surface exhibit completely different behaviors from the traditional discharge products of solid Li2S, which can function as effective adsorption and activation sites for the conversion of LiPS from long chain to short chain by accelerated redox reaction. The present study gains some key insights into how the atomic sulfur contributes to the intrinsic shuttle inhibition and offers a feasible way to design the atomic sulfur-based cathode materials of Li-S batteries with better electrochemical performance.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Amorphous MoS3 as the sulfur-equivalent cathode material for room-temperature Li–S and Na–S batteries,"Many problems associated with Li–S and Na–S batteries essentially root in the generation of their soluble polysulfide intermediates. While conventional wisdom mainly focuses on trapping polysulfides at the cathode using various functional materials, few strategies are available at present to fully resolve or circumvent this long-standing issue. In this study, we propose the concept of sulfur-equivalent cathode materials, and demonstrate the great potential of amorphous MoS3 as such a material for room-temperature Li–S and Na–S batteries. In Li–S batteries, MoS3 exhibits sulfur-like behavior with large reversible specific capacity, excellent cycle life, and the possibility to achieve high areal capacity. Most remarkably, it is also fully cyclable in the carbonate electrolyte under a relatively high temperature of 55 °C. MoS3 can also be used as the cathode material of even more challenging Na–S batteries to enable decent capacity and good cycle life. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments are carried out to track the structural evolution of MoS3. It largely preserves its chain-like structure during repetitive battery cycling without generating any free polysulfide intermediates.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Generalized Synthesis of a Family of Highly Heteroatom-Doped Ordered Mesoporous Carbons,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.High concentrations of heteroatom can be doped into ordered mesoporous carbon by infiltration of molten dopants into silica-reinforced mesoporous cross-linked polymer (resol) and subsequent carbonization. The high concentration of dopants relative to polymer enables a high probability of heteroatoms to be dynamically integrated into the framework through carbonization, while the silica in the framework prevents loss of the ordered structure. This method is demonstrated to generate ordered mesoporous carbons with high heteroatom content (up to 26 atom % N, 15 atom % B, 7 atom % P, or 4 atom % S) for a wide variety of elements through melt infusion of the appropriate dopant (melamine, boric anhydride, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, or dibenzyl sulfide). The ratio of the solid dopants to mesoporous silica-resol in a physical mixture during the melt infusion provides a simple methodology to precisely tune the doping content in the carbonized material. Etching of the silica postcarbonization generates additional micropores to produce porous doped carbons with high surface areas that can exceed 2000 m2/g. Increasing the doping of the mesoporous carbon leads to a decrease in the surface area as the framework is swollen during the incorporation of the heteroatoms that leads to an increase in the d-spacing of the mesostructure, but the ordered structure is maintained with well-defined mesopores. With the advantages of high surface area, well-defined pore size, and tunable doping concentration through a straightforward methodology, it is expected that this family of mesoporous carbons will provide model materials for fundamental studies in diverse applications from energy storage to catalysis to adsorption for separations.",Chemistry of Materials

Hence, the design and preparation of next-generation electrode materials have been gaining increasing attention. Recent progress has demonstrated that three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanomaterials are extremely promising candidates for the electrodes of electrochemical energy storage devices due to their unique structural advantages of interlinked architecture. Herein, recent advances in the scalable fabrication of 3D carbon nanofiber (CNF)-based materials and their applications for electrochemical energy storage devices are summarized.

"Graphitized nanocarbon-supported metal catalysts: synthesis, properties, and applications in heterogeneous catalysis","© 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Graphitized nanocarbon materials can be an ideal catalyst support for heterogeneous catalytic systems. Their unique physical and chemical properties, such as large surface area, high adsorption capacity, excellent thermal and mechanical stability, outstanding electronic properties, and tunable porosity, allow the anchoring and dispersion of the active metals.

Physico-chemical and electrochemical properties of nanoparticulate NiO/C composites for high performance lithium and sodium ion battery anodes,"© 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Nanoparticulate NiO and NiO/C composites with different carbon proportions have been prepared for anode application in lithium and sodium ion batteries. Structural characterization demonstrated the presence of metallic Ni in the composites. Morphological study revealed that the NiO and Ni nanoparticles were well dispersed in the matrix of amorphous carbon. The electrochemical study showed that the lithium ion batteries (LIBs), containing composites with carbon, have promising electrochemical performances, delivering specific discharge capacities of 550 mAh/g after operating for 100 cycles at 1C. These excellent results could be explained by the homogeneity of particle size and structure, as well as the uniform distribution of NiO/Ni nanoparticles in the in situ generated amorphous carbon matrix. On the other hand, the sodium ion battery (NIB) with the NiO/C composite revealed a poor cycling stability. Post-mortem analyses revealed that this fact could be ascribed to the absence of a stable Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) or passivation layer upon cycling.",Nanomaterials
In-situ electron microscopy observation of electrochemical sodium plating and stripping dynamics on carbon nanofiber current collectors,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdSodium metal holds promise as the ultimate anode for high-energy-density Na battery systems. Recent progress has been made in terms of rational design of nanostructured 3D current collectors for dendrite-free Na deposition with limited dimensional changes during cycling. However, critical information such as Na nucleation and growth behavior on these hosts remains elusive. Herein, by using amorphous carbon nanofibers (CNF) as a current collector, we present the first nanoscale-resolution observation of electrochemical Na plating/stripping dynamics via in situ electron microscopies. With the use of solid electrolyte, Na metal was found to grow and dissolve reversibly as nano/micro-particles at all the possible locations around indiviual CNFs and even throughout their network. Notably, inter-fiber Na ion transport was experimentally confirmed, which enables more homogeneous Na deposition deep into the network interior without interfacing the electrolyte; this would be crucial for dendrite-free Na plating, especially in all-solid-state Na batteries. In addition, through a delicately designed in-situ experiment, the CNF interior exhibited a superior Na capacity compared to its graphitized counterpart. Thus, owning to both exterior and interior Na storage of each fiber, CNFs could be a promising host material for building rechargeable composite Na metal anodes with ultrahigh capacity.",Nano Energy
Designing solid-liquid interphases for sodium batteries,"© 2017 The Author(s).Secondary batteries based on earth-abundant sodium metal anodes are desirable for both stationary and portable electrical energy storage. Room-temperature sodium metal batteries are impractical today because morphological instability during recharge drives rough, dendritic electrodeposition. Chemical instability of liquid electrolytes also leads to premature cell failure as a result of parasitic reactions with the anode. Here we use joint density-functional theoretical analysis to show that the surface diffusion barrier for sodium ion transport is a sensitive function of the chemistry of solid-electrolyte interphase. In particular, we find that a sodium bromide interphase presents an exceptionally low energy barrier to ion transport, comparable to that of metallic magnesium. We evaluate this prediction by means of electrochemical measurements and direct visualization studies. These experiments reveal an approximately three-fold reduction in activation energy for ion transport at a sodium bromide interphase. Direct visualization of sodium electrodeposition confirms large improvements in stability of sodium deposition at sodium bromide-rich interphases.",Nature Communications

A rechargeable iodine-carbon battery that exploits ion intercalation and iodine redox chemistry,"© 2017 The Author(s).Graphitic carbons have been used as conductive supports for developing rechargeable batteries. However, the classic ion intercalation in graphitic carbon has yet to be coupled with extrinsic redox reactions to develop rechargeable batteries. Herein, we demonstrate the preparation of a free-standing, flexible nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped hierarchically porous graphitic carbon for iodine loading by pyrolysis of polyaniline coated cellulose wiper. We find that heteroatoms could provide additional defect sites for encapsulating iodine while the porous carbon skeleton facilitates redox reactions of iodine and ion intercalation. The combination of ion intercalation with redox reactions of iodine allows for developing rechargeable iodine-carbon batteries free from the unsafe lithium/sodium metals, and hence eliminates the long-standing safety issue. The unique architecture of the hierarchically porous graphitic carbon with heteroatom doping not only provides suitable spaces for both iodine encapsulation and cation intercalation but also generates efficient electronic and ionic transport pathways, thus leading to enhanced performance.",Nature Communications
Origins of Dendrite Formation in Sodium–Oxygen Batteries and Possible Countermeasures,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimOne limiting phenomenon for the cycle life of metal–oxygen batteries is the growth of dendrites during metal plating (cell charging). For the relatively new sodium–oxygen cell, this subject has been scarcely investigated, until now. Therefore, dendrite formation is systematically investigated herein, with the aim of gaining a more detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms and relevant control parameters. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cycling experiments, and optical characterization techniques are applied in situ and ex situ; sodium dendrite growth is directly visualized, for the first time, by means of a tubular glass cell. The growth of instable surface morphologies is discussed from a theoretical perspective to comprehend the experimentally observed dendrite growth. Furthermore, countermeasures against issues with dendrites are discussed, with the aim of increasing the cycle life of sodium–oxygen batteries.",Energy Technology
The origin of potential rise during charging of Li-O2 batteries,"© 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.When aprotic Li-O2 batteries recharge, the solid Li2O2 in the positive electrode is oxidized, which often exhibits a continuous or step increase in the charging potential as a function of the charging capacity, and its origin remains incompletely understood. Here, we report a model study of electro-oxidation of a Li2O2 film on an Au electrode using voltammetry coupled with in situ Raman spectroscopy. It was found that the charging reaction initializes at the positive electrode|Li2O2 interface, instead of the previously presumed Li2O2 surface, and consists of two temporally and spatially separated Li2O2 oxidation processes, accounting for the potential rise during charging of Li-O2 batteries. Moreover, the electrode surface-initialized oxidation can disintegrate the Li2O2 film resulting in a loss of Li2O2 into electrolyte solution, which drastically decreases the charging efficiency and highlights the importance of using soluble electro-catalyst for the complete charging of Li-O2 batteries.",Science China Chemistry

Simultaneous Formation of Artificial SEI Film and 3D Host for Stable Metallic Sodium Anodes,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Metallic sodium is a promising anode for sodium-based batteries, owing to its high theoretical capacity (1165 mAh g-1) and low potential (-2.714 V vs standard hydrogen electrode). However, the growth of sodium dendrites and the infinite volume change of metallic sodium during sodium striping/plating result in a low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycling stability, generating a safety hazard of sodium-based batteries. Here, an efficient approach was proposed to simultaneously generate an artificial SEI film and 3D host for metallic sodium based on a conversion reaction (CR) between sodium and MoS2 (4Na + MoS2 = 2Na2S + Mo) at room temperature. In the resultant sodium-MoS2 hybrid after the conversion reaction (Na-MoS2 (CR)), the production Na2S is homogeneously dispersed on the surface of metallic sodium, which can act as an artificial SEI film, efficiently preventing the growth of sodium dendrites; the residual MoS2 nanosheets can construct a 3D host to confine metallic sodium, accommodating largely the volume change of sodium. Consequently, the Na-MoS2 (CR) hybrid exhibits very low overpotential of 25 mV and a very long cycle stability more than 1000 cycles. This novel strategy is promising to promote the development of metal (lithium, sodium, zinc)-based electrodes.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

A cell using P2S5, which is not ion conductive, in the sulfur electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 340 mAh (g‑sulfur electrode)− 1 at 0.04 C rate at 25 °C, which is much larger than that (37.3 mAh (g‑sulfur electrode)− 1) obtained in a conventional cell using a high ion-conductive Na3PS4 electrolyte. To investigate the reaction mechanism of the sulfur composite electrode containing P2S5, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) observations of the electrodes were conducted. The results indicate that a crystalline Na3PS4 component is automatically produced by the electrochemical reaction with Na in the amorphous S-P2S5 electrode and it mixing with the sulfur redox parts at the nanoscale. The mixing degree is higher than that at microscale in the conventional S-Na3PS4 electrode, which results in the high capacity of the cells containing the S-P2S5 electrode. Partial substitution of P2S5 for SiS2 in the sulfur electrode suppresses the nanocrystallization and further increases the reversible capacity up to 390 mAh (g‑sulfur electrode)− 1 under 0.04 C rate, which is the highest in reported all-solid-state Na batteries to date.",Solid State Ionics

Ambient-Temperature Energy Storage with Polyvalent Metal–Sulfur Chemistry,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Electrochemical energy storage with ambient-or room-temperature (RT) non-aqueous sulfur chemistry has attracted much attention. In addition to the great attention to lithium–sulfur chemistry and sodium–sulfur chemistry, the attention toward polyvalent metal–sulfur chemistry has increased. RT sulfur batteries with magnesium, calcium, and aluminum anodes are of particular interest. In comparison to alkali metal (lithium and sodium) anodes, magnesium, calcium, and aluminum offer multiple advantageous features in terms of safety, abundance, and cost. Therefore, rechargeable battery systems with magnesium–sulfur (Mg–S), calcium–sulfur (Ca–S), and aluminum–sulfur (Al–S) chemistries are promising low-cost options for large-scale electrical energy storage. However, the research on these battery chemistries/technologies is still in its infancy and is currently hampered by many critical challenges. Here, the historical development, fundamental principles, recent progress, and key challenges of Mg–S, Ca–S, and Al–S batteries are summarized. Similarities and differences between the alkali metal (Li, Na, and K)–sulfur chemistries and the polyvalent metal (Mg, Ca, and Al)–sulfur chemistries are discussed. Finally, future research and development directions are suggested.",Small Methods
Critical Role of Ultrathin Graphene Films with Tunable Thickness in Enabling Highly Stable Sodium Metal Anodes,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Sodium (Na) metal has shown great promise as an anode material for the next-generation energy storage systems because of its high theoretical capacity, low cost, and high earth abundance. However, the extremely high reactivity of Na metal with organic electrolyte leads to the formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and growth of Na dendrites upon repeated electrochemical stripping/plating, causing poor cycling performance, and serious safety issues. Herein, we present highly stable and dendrite-free Na metal anodes over a wide current range and long-term cycling via directly applying free-standing graphene films with tunable thickness on Na metal surface. We systematically investigate the dependence of Na anode stability on the thickness of the graphene film at different current densities and capacities. Our findings reveal that only a few nanometer (∼2-3 nm) differences in the graphene thickness can have decisive influence on the stability and rate capability of Na anodes. To achieve the optimal performance, the thickness of the graphene film covered on Na surface needs to be meticulously selected based on the applied current density. We demonstrate that with a multilayer graphene film (∼5 nm in thickness) as a protective layer, stable Na cycling behavior was first achieved in carbonate electrolyte without any additives over 100 cycles at a current density as high as 2 mA/cm2 with a high capacity of 3 mAh/cm2. We believe our work could be a viable route toward high-energy Na battery systems, and can provide valuable insights into the lithium batteries as well.",Nano Letters
Functional membrane separators for next-generation high-energy rechargeable batteries,"© The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of China Science Publishing & Media Ltd. All rights reserved.The membrane separator is a key component in a liquid-electrolyte battery for electrically separating the cathode and the anode, meanwhile ensuring ionic transport between them. Besides these basic requirements, endowing the separator with specific beneficial functions is now being paid great attention because it provides an important alternative approach for the development of batteries, particularly next-generation high-energy rechargeable batteries. Herein, functional separators are overviewed based on four key criteria of next-generation high-energy rechargeable batteries: stable, safe, smart and sustainable (4S). That is, the applied membrane materials and the corresponding functioning mechanisms of the 4S separators are reviewed. Functional separators with selective permeability have been applied to retard unwanted migration of the specific species (e.g. polysulfide anions in Li-S batteries) from one electrode to the other in order to achieve stable cycling operation. The covered battery types are Li-S, room-temperature Na-S, Li-organic, organic redox-flow (RF) and Li-air batteries. Safe, smart and sustainable separators are then described in sequence following the first criterion of stable cycling. In the final section, key challenges and potential opportunities in the development of 4S separators are discussed.",National Science Review
A high areal capacity lithium-sulfur battery cathode prepared by site-selective vapor infiltration of hierarchical carbon nanotube arrays,"© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The widespread use of melt infiltration has to date restricted sulfur-carbon cathode architectures to only host materials processed as bulk powders with no site control of sulfur deposits. Here, we combine structurally designed hierarchical carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays with site-selective vapor phase sulfur infiltration to produce thick electrodes with controlled sulfur loading and high areal performance. Our results illustrate the critical role structural hierarchy plays in sustaining electrical connectivity to enable high utilization of the sulfur embedded in thick electrodes with high gravimetric loading. Here, a primary large-diameter CNT population provides robust conductive trunks that branch into a secondary small-diameter and high-surface-area CNT population capable of giving rapid electrical access to coated sulfur. Site-selective vapor phase sulfur infiltration, based on the capillary effect, controllably targets loading of one or both of the CNT populations to facilitate gravimetric loading from 60 wt% to 70 wt% sulfur. With the high areal loading of 6 mg cm-2, we demonstrate 1092 mA h gS-1 and 6.5 mA h cm-2 and excellent rate performance with >60% capacity retained at 10 times the discharge rate. Overall, our work leverages site control of sulfur incorporation into a host cathode enabled by controlled CNT growth techniques to emphasize the important principle of ""quality over quantity"" in designing high areal loading strategies with high areal performance and good sulfur utilization.",Nanoscale

KGaA, WeinheimThis work studies for the first time the metallic 1T MoS2 sandwich grown on graphene tube as a freestanding intercalation anode for promising sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Sodium is earth-abundant and readily accessible. Compared to lithium, the main challenge of sodium-ion batteries is its sluggish ion diffusion kinetic. The freestanding, porous, hollow structure of the electrode allows maximum electrolyte accessibility to benefit the transportation of Na+ ions. Meanwhile, the metallic MoS2 provides excellent electron conductivity.

Among all promising electrode materials for NIBs, transition-mental sulfides have been identified as potential candidates owing to their distinct physics-chemistry characteristics. In this work, CoS2 nanomaterials anchored into multichannel carbon nanofibers (MCNFs), synthesized via a facile solvothermal method with a sulfidation process, are studied as flexible free-standing electrode materials for NIBs. CoS2 nanoparticles uniformly distributed in the vertical and horizontal multichannel networks. Such nanoarchitecture can not only support space for volume expansion of CoS2 during discharge/charge process, but also facilitate ion/electron transport along the interfaces. In particular, the CoS2@MCNF electrode delivers an impressively high specific capacity (537.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), extraordinarily long-term cycling stability (315.7 mAh g-1 at at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles), and excellent rate capacity (537.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and 201.9 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1) for sodium storage.

Progress in the Development of Sodium-Ion Solid Electrolytes,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.The development of safe, reliable, yet economical energy storage has been reemphasized with recent incidents involving the explosion and subsequent recall of lithium-ion batteries. The organic liquid electrolyte used in the conventional lithium-ion battery can potentially act as a fuel for combustion in a thermal-runaway reaction, and hence an alternative with a significantly reduced flammability must be sought. All-solid-state batteries have the potential to meet safety and reliability requirements with the possibility of increasing the volumetric energy density of the system, making these a promising candidate for the development of the next generation of energy storage. Moreover, the sodium-ion battery exhibits a better cost-efficiency without significantly compromising the energy density, making the combination of the sodium chemistry with the solid electrolyte an attractive choice for safe and economical energy storage. Here, a general background on the recent development of ceramic and glass-ceramic sodium-ion-conducting electrolytes is provided with regard to oxide-, sulfide-, and hydride-based electrolytes. The ionic conductivity, chemical stability, and mechanical properties of the sodium-based solid electrolyte are discussed, which is followed by a perspec-tive on future developments in the field.",Small Methods
Reversible S0/MgSx Redox Chemistry in a MgTFSI2/MgCl2/DME Electrolyte for Rechargeable Mg/S Batteries,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe redox chemistry of magnesium and its application in rechargeable Mg batteries has received increasing attention owing to the unique benefits of Mg metal electrodes, namely high reversibility without dendrite formation, low reduction potentials, and high specific capacities. The Mg/S couple is of particular interest owing to its high energy density and low cost. Previous reports have confirmed the feasibility of a rechargeable Mg/S battery; however, only limited cycling stability was achieved, and the complicated procedure for the preparation of the electrolytes has significantly compromised the benefits of Mg/S chemistry and hindered the development of Mg/S batteries. Herein, we report the development of the first rechargeable Mg/S battery with a MgTFSI2/MgCl2/DME electrolyte (DME=1,2-dimethoxyethane, TFSI=bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) and realize the best cycling stability among all reported Mg/S batteries by suppressing polysulfide dissolution. Mechanistic studies show that the battery works via S0/MgSx redox processes and that the large voltage hysteresis is mainly due to the Mg anode overpotential.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Sulfur Copolymer: A New Cathode Structure for Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.High-energy electrochemical storage containing earth abundant materials could be a choice for future battery development. Recent research reports indicated the possibility of room-temperature sodium-ion-sulfur chemistry for large storage including smart grids. Here, we report a room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery cathode that will address the native downsides of a sodium-sulfur battery, such as polysulfide shuttling and low electrical conductivity of elemental sulfur. In this Letter, we use a sustainable route which ensures a large sulfur confinement (i.e., ∼90 wt %) in the cathode structure. The sulfur-embedded polymer is realized via thermal ring-opening polymerization of benzoxazine in the presence of elemental sulfur (CS90) and later composite with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The resulting CS90 allows a homogeneous distribution of sulfur due to in situ formation of the polymer backbone and allows maximum utilization of sulfur. This unique electrode structure bestows CS90-rGO with an excellent Coulombic efficiency (99%) and healthy cycle life.",ACS Energy Letters
Nanoconfined Iron Oxychloride Material as a High-Performance Cathode for Rechargeable Chloride Ion Batteries,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.As a group of attractive photoelectromagnetic and catalytic functional materials, metal oxychlorides have been attracting attention for electrochemical energy storage in rechargeable chloride ion battery (CIB) systems recently. Their application, however, is limited by the complicated synthesis and/or poor cycling stability. Herein, a facile strategy using vacuum impregnation and subsequent thermal decomposition at mild conditions has been developed to synthesize the FeOCl/CMK-3 nanocomposite material. Benefiting from the nanoconfined structure, a high-performance FeOCl/CMK-3 cathode, which has a high discharge capacity of 202 mAh g-1, superior cycling stability, and significantly improved charge transfer and chloride ion diffusion, is achieved. The electrolyte component is found to show a high affinity with the chlorine layer in the FeOCl phase, inducing evident expansion of the FeOCl layers along the b-axis direction and thus boosting a new potential liquid exfoliation approach for preparing 2D FeOCl material. Importantly, reversible electrochemical reactions of the FeOCl cathode material based on the redox reactions of iron species and chloride ion transfer are revealed.",ACS Energy Letters
Growth of NaO2 in Highly Efficient Na-O2 Batteries Revealed by Synchrotron in Operando X-ray Diffraction,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The development of Na-O2 batteries requires understanding the formation of reaction products, as different groups reported compounds such as sodium peroxide, sodium superoxide, and hydrated sodium peroxide as the main discharge products. In this study, we used in operando synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) to (i) quantitatively track the formation of NaO2 in Na-O2 cells and (ii) measure how the growth of crystalline NaO2 is influenced by the choice of electrolyte salt. The results reveal that the discharge could be divided into two time regions and that the formation of NaO2 during the major part of the discharge reaction is highly efficient. The findings indicate that the cell with NaOTf salt exhibited higher capacity than the cell with NaPF6 salt, whereas the average domain size of NaO2 particles decreases during the discharge. This fundamental insight brings new information on the working mechanism of Na-O2 batteries.",ACS Energy Letters
Carbon-based Oxamate Cobalt(III) complexes as bioenzyme mimics for contaminant elimination in high backgrounds of complicated constituents,"© 2017 by the authors.Complex wastewater with massive components is now a serious environmental issue facing humanity. Selective removal of low-concentration contaminants in mixed constituents holds great promise for increasing water supplies. Bioenzymes like horseradish peroxidase exhibit oxidizing power and selectivity. Here, we manufactured its mimic through immobilizing non-heme oxamate anionic cobalt(III) complex ([CoIII(opba)]-, opba = o-phenylenebis(oxamate)) onto pyridine (Py) modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes ([CoIII(opba)]- -Py-MWCNTs, MWCNTs = multiwalled carbon nanotubes), where MWCNTs captured substrates and Py functioned as the fifth ligand. We chose typical azo dye (C.I. Acid Red 1) and antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) as model substrates. Without • OH, this catalyst could detoxify target micropollutants efficiently at pH from 8 to 11. It also remained efficient in repetitive tests, and the final products were non-poisonous OH-containing acids. Combined with radical scavenger tests and electron paramagnetic resonance result, we speculated that high-valent cobalt-oxo active species and oxygen atom transfer reaction dominated in the reaction pathway. According to density functional theory calculations, the electron spin density distribution order showed that electron-withdrawing ligand was beneficial for inward pulling the excess electron and lowering the corresponding energy levels, achieving an electrophilic-attack enhancement of the catalyst. With target removal property and recyclability, this catalyst is prospective in water detoxication.",Materials
An Extremely High Surface Area Mesoporous-Microporous-Networked Pillared Carbon for High Stability Li-S and Intermediate Temperature Na-S Batteries,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimA high surface area porous carbon synthesized using a sacrificial-template assisted synthesis protocol, is demonstrated here as a host for the confinement of sulfur for use in Li−S and intermediate temperature (25-70 °C) Na−S rechargeable batteries. The hierarchical porous pillared carbon host, comprising of an intricate network of mesopores and micropores provide a landscape of sites with varying strength of interaction with sulfur. Thus, the amount of sulfur (and associated polysulfides) inside the carbon host is predetermined by the host structural characteristics rather than by the loading protocol. The mesoporous-microporous carbon led to sulfur content in excess of 70%. While the bulk of S (and polysulfides) are stored inside the mesopores of the carbon host, the micropore apart from sulfur storage strongly contributes towards the modulation of sulfur flux during charge-discharge cycling. The S−C cathode exhibited remarkable cycling and rate capability with Li and also against Na at intermediate temperature (25-70 °C). This result is a paradigm shift from the conventional Na−S electrochemistry which is known to efficiently work only at elevated temperatures, in the temperature range starting from excess of 100 °C to 300 °C.",ChemistrySelect
Nitrogen-Doped Graphene Nanosheets/S Composites as Cathode in Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRoom-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na−S) batteries have gained increasing attention from energy storage community in recent years. In this work, homogeneous nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets/sulfur (NGNS/S) nanocomposites, synthesized using chemical reaction-deposition method and low temperature heat treatment, were studied as active cathode materials for RT Na−S batteries. Different loading composites with 86%, 65%, 45% and 25% gamma-S8 have been electrochemically evaluated, respectively, and compared with two control electrodes of NGNS and S. It was found that the NGNS/S composite with 25% S loading exhibited the best electrochemical performance with specific capacities of 212 and 136 mAh g−1 in the 1st and 10th cycles, respectively. The enhanced electrochemical performance of NGNS/S nanocomposite is mainly attributed to the improved kinetics due to the NGNS conductive network and easier intercalation of Na+ into expanded NGNS layers due to the addition of S within the graphene layers. In addition, the composite with 25% S loading shows higher surface area and complete reaction with product of Na2S, which likely contributes to the improved energy capacity.",ChemistrySelect
Constructing hierarchical sulfur-doped nitrogenous carbon nanosheets for sodium-ion storage,"© 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.Hierarchical sulfur-doped nitrogenous carbon (S/NC) and nitrogenous carbon (NC) nanosheets are successfully fabricated by carbonization of their corresponding precursor polymers which are synthesized through the polymerization reaction of dianhydride and multi-amine compounds. Hierarchical S/NC nanosheets deliver greatly enhanced reversible capacity, compared with hierarchical NC nanosheets, of 280 mAh g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 after 300 cycles. It is found that the introduction of sulfur species in carbon skeleton results in increasing the turbostratic structures, rather than enlarging the interlayer distances, for boosting the specific capacity of sodium-ion storage. The turbostratic structures and sulfur dopant existed in the carbon can offer more active sites for the sodium-ion storage. Carbon-based materials doped with sulfur are capable of improving the sodium-ion storage property, which can broaden the horizon of designing a string of outstanding carbon materials for the future energy storage technologies.",Nanotechnology

With the investigation of the carbonization temperature and the preparation process, the synthesized ligand-derived carbon matrix (Z-1000) displayed a high electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity owing to the spatially ordered porous structure, high graphitization and doped nitrogen. In order to test the electrochemical properties of this material, a range of substances were detected by Z-1000 modified electrodes (Z-1000/GCE) and satisfactory results were obtained. In optimized conditions, the linear responses of the Z-1000/GCE for uric acid (UA) and catechol (CT) were obtained from 0.001 mM to 0.3 mM with detection limit of 1.4 × 10−8 M and 2.78 × 10−7 M, respectively. And a linear range for hydroquinone (HQ) was in the region of 0.001 mM–0.2 mM with detection limits of 2.15 × 10−7 M. These unique physical and chemical properties made it hold great promise in the development of multifunctional sensor. Meanwhile, the low cost and facile preparation of MOF-derived carbon made it become a potential candidate for electroanalysis.",Electrochimica Acta

Many nanosized carbon sheets formed on the particles could be of benefit for rapid intercalation/de-intercalation of potassium ions. Moreover, the d-spacing in the (100) crystal planes of the as-prepared active carbon is enlarged to 0.335 nm, even some formed carbon nanosheets can reach 0.358 nm, and the diffusion coefficient of K ion is also improved by 7 times as well. The as-prepared activated carbon electrode can deliver a high reversible capacity of 100 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles (at a high current density of 0.2 A g−1), and exhibits increased rate performance.

Effect of nano-dispersed silica on the ion-conducting behavior of PMMA-based polymer gel electrolytes containing LiPF6,"© 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Nano-sized silica poly(methylmethacrylate)-based gel electrolyte containing lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) was synthesized by using different binary solvent mixture (propylene carbonate(PC) and dimethylformamide (DMF) in different volume ratio). Role of DMF in PC: Higher DMF content in PC-based electrolyte shows higher ionic conductivity at all polymer content and at wide temperature regions (10-70 °C). A small increment in ionic conductivity at lower content of polymer in liquid/gel electrolyte was observed and having maximum conductivity of 13.12 mS/cm at 25 °C. Stability (mechanically and electrically), viscosity and ionic conductivity of gel electrolytes were improved with the addition of nano-sized silica at ambient temperature. Ionic conductivity of nano-sized silica-based gel electrolyte does not change much over 5o–70 °C temperature range and is factor-wise only which make indispensable in different electrochemical devices. Also polymer gel electrolyte membranes as such and with dispersed silica nano-particles were characterized through scanning electron microscope to study the morphology of gel matrix.",Ionics
Poly-acrylonitrile-based gel-polymer electrolytes for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Research and development activities on sodium-ion batteries are becoming prominent in the past few years. Compared to lithium-based batteries, the sodium-based batteries will be cheaper because of the abundancy of sodium raw materials in the earth’s crust and also in seawater. In the current study, we synthesized and characterized poly-acrylonitrile (PAN)-based gel-polymer electrolytes formed with NaClO4 and dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC). By systematically varying the weight ratios of polymer, salt, and the solvents, we obtained an optimum room temperature ionic conductivity of 4.5 mS cm−1 for the composition 11PAN-12NaClO4-40EC-37PC (wt.%), which is reasonably good for practical applications. This value of conductivity is comparable to a few other Na+ ion conducting gel-polymer electrolyte systems studied in the recent past. Variation of ionic conductivity with inverse temperature showed Arrhenius behavior. Activation energies estimated for all the samples showed only a slight variation suggesting that a single activation process which depends on the EC/PC co-solvent governs the ionic mobility in these gel-polymer electrolytes. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that there is no noticeable weight loss of these electrolytes up to 100 °C and hence the electrolytes are thermally stable for operating temperatures up to 100 °C.",Ionics

The resultant HPC nanostructures with a considerable specific surface area serve as an excellent substrate for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), coupled with fluorescence quenching, for molecular sensing of physically adsorbed Rhodamine 6G. The abundant nitrogen atoms terminating on the surface of HPC nanostructures play a critical role in promoting a large Raman enhancement generated via a chemical mechanism. Most importantly, the observed enhancement factors show a clear dependence on the mesoscale porosity within HPC nanostructures, indicating that the chemical enhancement can be steadily tuned with control over the interfacial areas as a function of the nanosphere size. The unique architecture of HPC nanostructures based on the construction of a building block of a well-defined network of core-shell nanospheres provides a new design strategy for fabricating SERS substrates.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Electrochemical transitions between S62− and the insoluble low-order polysulfides or sulfide (Sx2−, 1 ≤ x < 6) are reversible. A single-wall carbon nanotube coating applied to the battery separator helps alleviate the diffusion of the polysulfide species and reduces the polarization behavior of the Al-S batteries.",Advanced Energy Materials

Processable and Moldable Sodium-Metal Anodes,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium-ion batteries are similar in concept and function to lithium-ion batteries, but their development and commercialization lag far behind. One obstacle is the lack of a standard reference electrode. Unlike Li foil reference electrodes, sodium is not easily processable or moldable and it deforms easily. Herein we fabricate a processable and moldable composite Na metal anode made from Na and reduced graphene oxide (r-GO). With only 4.5 % percent r-GO, the composite anodes had improved hardness, strength, and stability to corrosion compared to Na metal, and can be engineered to various shapes and sizes. The plating/stripping cycling of the composite anode was significantly extended in both ether and carbonate electrolytes giving less dendrite formation.

Porous Al Current Collector for Dendrite-Free Na Metal Anodes,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Na-based batteries are proposed as promising energy storage candidates for beyond Li-ion technology due to the higher natural earth of Na metal. For its high capacity and low potential, Na metal may carve itself a niche when directly used as anodes. Similar to or even more problematic than Li, however, uneven plating/stripping of Na leads to dendrite formation. As the plating substrates, current collectors have a paramount influence on the Na plating/stripping behaviors. Here we propose porous Al current collectors as the plating substrate to suppress Na dendrites. Al does not alloy with Na. It is advantageous over Cu current collectors in terms of cost and weight. The interconnected porous structure can increase available surface for Na to nucleate and decrease the Na+ flux distribution, leading to homogeneous plating. The Na metal anodes can run for over 1000 cycles on porous Al with a low and stable voltage hysteresis and their average plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency was above 99.9%, which is greatly improved compared to planar Al. We used the porous Al for Na-O2, Na-Na3V2(PO4)3 cells with low Na amount and anode free Na-TiS2 batteries and anticipate that using this strategy can be combined with further electrolyte and cathodes to develop high performance Na-based batteries.",Nano Letters

In this review, we summarized the recent progress of flexible Li-S and analogous batteries. A brief introduction to flexible energy storage systems and general Li-S batteries has been provided first. Progress in flexible materials for flexible Li-S batteries are reviewed subsequently, with a detailed classification of flexible sulfur cathodes as those based on carbonaceous (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphene, and carbonized polymers) and composite (polymers and inorganics) materials and an overview of flexible lithium anodes and flexible solid-state electrolytes. Advancements in other flexible alkali metal-chalcogen batteries are then introduced. In the next part, we emphasize the importance of cell packaging and flexibility evaluation, and two special flexible battery prototypes of foldable and cable-type Li-S batteries are highlighted. In the end, existing challenges and future development of flexible Li-S and analogous alkali metal-chalcogen batteries are summarized and prospected.",Chemical Society Reviews
Nanofluidics in two-dimensional layered materials: Inspirations from nature,"© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.With the advance of chemistry, materials science, and nanotechnology, significant progress has been achieved in the design and application of synthetic nanofluidic devices and materials, mimicking the gating, rectifying, and adaptive functions of biological ion channels. Fundamental physics and chemistry behind these novel transport phenomena on the nanoscale have been explored in depth on single-pore platforms. However, toward real-world applications, one major challenge is to extrapolate these single-pore devices into macroscopic materials. Recently, inspired partially by the layered microstructure of nacre, the material design and large-scale integration of artificial nanofluidic devices have stepped into a completely new stage, termed 2D nanofluidics. Unique advantages of the 2D layered materials have been found, such as facile and scalable fabrication, high flux, efficient chemical modification, tunable channel size, etc. These features enable wide applications in, for example, biomimetic ion transport manipulation, molecular sieving, water treatment, and nanofluidic energy conversion and storage. This review highlights the recent progress, current challenges, and future perspectives in this emerging research field of ""2D nanofluidics"", with emphasis on the thought of bio-inspiration.",Chemical Society Reviews
Advances in high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.Lithium-sulfur batteries are considered to be rather latest and high-performance storage batteries due to their high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh·g−1), high energy density (2600 Wh·kg−1), environmental friendliness, low cost, and safety. These features make them important in the field of mobile electric vehicles and portable devices. However, because of rapid capacity attenuation with poor cycle and rate performances, these batteries are far from ideal for commercial applications.

A Polymer-Infused Solid-State Synthesis of a Long Cycle-Life Na3V2(PO4)3/C Composite,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The cost of large-scale battery-based energy storage systems can be substantially reduced by using long cycle-life active battery materials which can be easily synthesized. This paper describes the synthesis of a sodium vanadium phosphate (Na3V2(PO4)3, NVP)/carbon composite as the sodium ion battery (NIB) cathode material by a facile solid-state method which can increase the cost competitiveness of NIBs relative to the lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The NVP synthesized as such features NVP particles tethering to a cellular carbon network formed in situ by the carbonization of a low melting polymer percolating the NVP particles. The immobilization of the NVP particles can better preserve their electrical integration within the electrode, the loss of which is conjectured to be the major cause of capacity loss. The hypothesis was validated by performance comparison with a conventional carbon-coated NVP/C composite with the same initial discharge capacity but which showed a more severe capacity fading in extended cycling. This study presents not only a new strategy to extend the cycle life of cathode materials but also a cost-effective way to produce them.",ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering
Synthesis of Hollow SnO2/SnS2 Hybrids and their Application in Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAlloying-type Sn material has been considered as an excellent anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the limitation of capacity is still a challenge that remains to be solved. In this approach, we introduce a facile two-step hydrothermal route to prepare hollow SnO2/SnS2 hybrids and investigate their electrochemical performances as anodes in SIBs for the first time. Benefiting from their structural features, the hollow SnO2/SnS2 hybrids exhibit a high reversible sodium storage capacity of about 485.64 mA h g−1 at 300 mA g−1 after 100 cycles with a capacity retention of 78.7 %, which is much higher than 25.9 % for bare SnO2 hollow spheres and 28.5 % for bare SnS2 nanosheets. Taking into consideration the outstanding performance and the special structural design, this work could provide a potential strategy to improve the electrochemical performances of tin-based electrodes, as well as that of other anodes in SIBs.",ChemElectroChem
Controlled synthesis of iron sulfide coated by carbon layer to improve lithium and sodium storage,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdDesign and constructing hierarchical architecture nanostructure is very effective to achieve good electrochemical performance for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, uniform hierarchical Fe7S8 nanostructures coated by thin carbon layer (Fe7S8/C) have been prepared by a facile Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) assisting hydrothermal method and heat treatment.

High purity Mn5O8 nanoparticles with a high overpotential to gas evolution reactions for high voltage aqueous sodium-ion electrochemical storage,"© 2017, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.Developing electrodes with high specific energy by using inexpensive manganese oxides is of great importance for aqueous electrochemical energy storage (EES) using non-Li charge carriers such as Na-or K-ions. However, the energy density of aqueous EES devices is generally limited by their narrow thermodynamic potential window (~1.23 V). In this paper, the synthesis of high purity layered Mn5O8 nanoparticles through solid state thermal treatment of Mn3O4 spinel nanoparticles, resulting in a chemical formula of [Mn2 2+] [Mn3 4+ O8 2–], evidenced by Rietveld refinement of synchrotron- based X-ray diffraction, has been reported. The electro-kinetic analyses obtained from cyclic voltammetry measurements in half-cells have demonstrated that Mn5O8 electrode has a large overpotential (~ 0.6 V) towards gas evolution reactions, resulting in a stable potential window of 2.5 V in an aqueous electrolyte in half-cell measurements. Symmetric full-cells fabricated using Mn5O8 electrodes can be operated within a stable 3.0 V potential window for 5000 galvanostatic cycles, exhibiting a stable electrode capacity of about 103 mAh/g at a C-rate of 95 with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency and 96% energy efficiency.",Frontiers in Energy

"High Capacity, Superior Cyclic Performances in All-Solid-State Lithium-Ion Batteries Based on 78Li2S-22P2S5 Glass-Ceramic Electrolytes Prepared via Simple Heat Treatment","© 2017 American Chemical Society.Highly Li-ion conductive 78Li2S-22P2S5 glass-ceramic electrolytes were prepared by simple heat treatment of the glass phase obtained via mechanical ball milling. A high ionic conductivity of ∼1.78 × 10-3 S cm-1 is achieved at room temperature and is attributed to the formation of a crystalline phase of high lithium-ion conduction. All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries based on these glass-ceramic electrolytes are assembled by using Li2S nanoparticles or low-cost commercially available FeS2 as active cathode materials and Li-In alloys as anode. A high discharge capacity of 535 mAh g-1 is achieved after at least 50 cycles for the all-solid-state cells with Li2S as cathode materials, suggesting a rather high capacity retention of 97.4%. Even for the cells using low-cost FeS2 as cathode materials, same high discharge capacity of 560 mAh g-1 is also achieved after at least 50 cycles.

The surface morphology of electrospun PVdF-HFP nanocomposite membranes was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The effect of SiO2 nanoparticles incorporation onto electrospun PVdF-HFP polymer membranes (esPMs) has been studied by XRD, DSC, TGA, and tensile analysis. The electrospun PVdF-HFP/SiO2 based nanocomposite membrane electrolytes (esCPMEs) were prepared by soaking the corresponding esCPMs into 1 M LiPF6 in EC:DMC (1:1 vol/vol %). The ionic conductivity of the esCPMEs was studied by AC-impedance studies and it was found that the incorporation of SiO2 nanoparticles into PVdF-HFP membrane has improved the ionic conductivity from 1.320 × 10−3 S cm−1 to 2.259 × 10−3 S cm−1. The electrochemical stability of the esCPME was studied by linear sweep voltammetry studies and it was found to be 2.87 V. Finally, a prototype LiCo0.2Mn1.8O4//C Li-ion capacitor (LIC) cell was fabricated with esCPME, which delivered a discharge capacitance of 128 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 and retained 86% of its discharge capacitance even after 10,000 cycles. These results demonstrated that the esCPMEs could be used as promising polymer membrane electrolyte for LICs. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

A High-Performance Li–O2 Battery with a Strongly Solvating Hexamethylphosphoramide Electrolyte and a LiPON-Protected Lithium Anode,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe aprotic Li–O2 battery has attracted a great deal of interest because theoretically it can store more energy than today's Li-ion batteries. However, current Li–O2 batteries suffer from passivation/clogging of the cathode by discharged Li2O2, high charging voltage for its subsequent oxidation, and accumulation of side reaction products (particularly Li2CO3 and LiOH) upon cycling. Here, an advanced Li–O2 battery with a hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) electrolyte is reported that can dissolve Li2O2, Li2CO3, and LiOH up to 0.35, 0.36, and 1.11 × 10−3m, respectively, and a LiPON-protected lithium anode that can be reversibly cycled in the HMPA electrolyte. Compared to the benchmark of ether-based Li–O2 batteries, improved capacity, rate capability, voltaic efficiency, and cycle life are achieved for the HMPA-based Li–O2 cells. More importantly, a combination of advanced research techniques provide compelling evidence that operation of the HMPA-based Li–O2 battery is backed by nearly reversible formation/decomposition of Li2O2 with negligible side reactions.",Advanced Materials
Toward Safe Lithium Metal Anode in Rechargeable Batteries: A Review,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The lithium metal battery is strongly considered to be one of the most promising candidates for high-energy-density energy storage devices in our modern and technology-based society. However, uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth induces poor cycling efficiency and severe safety concerns, dragging lithium metal batteries out of practical applications. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the lithium metal anode and its dendritic lithium growth. First, the working principles and technical challenges of a lithium metal anode are underscored. Specific attention is paid to the mechanistic understandings and quantitative models for solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, lithium dendrite nucleation, and growth. On the basis of previous theoretical understanding and analysis, recently proposed strategies to suppress dendrite growth of lithium metal anode and some other metal anodes are reviewed.

Chemistry of Sputter-Deposited Lithium Sulfide Films,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Lithium sulfide (Li2S) is under intense study because it is the insulating discharge product of ultrahigh energy density lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries and a candidate cathode material for lithium-metal-free Li-S cells. In this work, we report the fabrication of an apparatus for sputter deposition of Li2S films ranging in thickness from a few nanometers to several micrometers at rates over 2 nm min-1. High-temperature annealing of the films is shown to produce crystalline films of high chemical purity Li2S for the first time. We provide evidence via complementary X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy that sputter deposition produces a unique sulfide structure composed of polymer-like chains of Li2S units. The electrochemistry of these films is markedly different from annealed crystalline Li2S, which is shown to be electrochemically inactive. The full theoretical capacity of the as-deposited sulfide structure could be realized during galvanostatic charge, suggesting a facile, solid-state charge process. Finally, we explore trends in the plasma chemistry that lead to nonstoichiometry and depth inhomogeneity during Li2S sputter deposition.",Journal of the American Chemical Society

Controllable N-Doped CuCo2O4@C Film as a Self-Supported Anode for Ultrastable Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimRational synthesis of flexible electrodes is crucial to rapid growth of functional materials for energy-storage systems. Herein, a controllable fabrication is reported for the self-supported structure of CuCo2O4 nanodots (≈3 nm) delicately inserted into N-doped carbon nanofibers (named as 3-CCO@C); this composite is first used as binder-free anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Benefiting from the synergetic effect of ultrasmall CuCo2O4 nanoparticles and a tailored N-doped carbon matrix, the 3-CCO@C composite exhibits high cycling stability (capacity of 314 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 after 1000 cycles) and high rate capability (296 mA h g−1, even at 5000 mA g−1). Significantly, the Na storage mechanism is systematically explored, demonstrating that the irreversible reaction of CuCo2O4, which decomposes to Cu and Co, happens in the first discharge process, and then a reversible reaction between metallic Cu/Co and CuO/Co3O4 occurrs during the following cycles. This result is conducive to a mechanistic study of highly promising bimetallic-oxide anodes for rechargeable SIBs.",Small
Flexible carbon nanotube modified separator for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have become promising candidates for electrical energy storage systems due to their high theoretical specific energy density, low cost and environmental friendliness. However, there are some technical obstacles of lithium-sulfur batteries to be addressed, such as the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Here, we introduced organically modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a coating layer for the separator to optimize structure and enhance the performance of the Li-S battery. The results showed that the cell with a CNTs-coated separator exhibited an excellent cycling performance. Compared to the blank separator, the initial discharge capacity and the capacity after 100 cycles for the CNTs-coated separator was increased by 115% and 161%, respectively. Besides, according to the rate capability test cycling from 0.1C to 2C, the battery with a CNTs-coated separator still released a capacity amounting to 90.2% of the initial capacity, when the current density returned back to 0.1C. It is believed that the organically modified CNTs coating effectively suppresses the shuttle effect during the cycling. The employment of a CNTs-coated separator provides a promising approach for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.",Nanomaterials
Selection of container materials for modern planar sodium sulfur (NaS) energy storage cells towards higher thermo-mechanical stability,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdSodium sulfur (NaS) cell is recognized as a promising candidate for advanced grid-scale large energy storage systems (ESS). In this work, we study the impacts of planar NaS cell container materials on the accumulation of residual stresses in the cell joints and solid electrolyte during the cell assembly and operation processes. Concentration of such thermo-mechanical stress in these vulnerable areas in the modern NaS cells can lead to catastrophic cell failures, which can present a huge challenge for developing large planar NaS cells towards commercial deployment. Here, we employ the finite-element analysis (FEA) computational technique to quantitatively assess the thermo-mechanical stress accumulation using prototype planar NaS cells. Relevant experimental procedures with corresponding thermal cycling conditions for the cell assembly, operation, and maintenance processes are incorporated into the FEA model. The influences of Al alloy (Al3003), stainless steels (STS304 and STS340), and iron-nickel-cobalt superalloy (KOVAR) on the residual stress accumulation are tested and thoroughly discussed. The computation results show that high stress concentration can be developed in the cell joint area. Through the comprehensive computational analysis, it is suggested that applying smaller CTE (less than ∼12 × 10−6 K−1) alloys is necessary to secure the thermo-mechanical stability of NaS cells that can be implemented in a large scale ESS.",Journal of Energy Storage

We thoroughly analyzed the ageing of the negative electrode (lithium metal) interface under open circuit conditions as a function of the nature of species present in the electrolyte, including the influence of dissolved binder and/or long-chain polysulfides. In a similar manner, we investigated the positive electrode interface. Herein, the objective was to understand the impact of an individual electrode component on the impedance response of the symmetric cell, and, more importantly, to discern the role of the sulfur in charge transfer reaction(s).",Electrochimica Acta
How to Control the Discharge Product in Sodium–Oxygen Batteries: Proposing New Pathways for Sodium Peroxide Formation,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimIt is an unsolved problem how to steer between sodium superoxide and sodium peroxide as discharge products in sodium–oxygen batteries. Sodium peroxide yields a higher theoretical energy density; thus, it is preferred in view of maximized energy density. Three novel approaches to form sodium peroxide are presented: First, cells loaded with sodium superoxide are further discharged in argon, with the aim of reducing sodium superoxide to peroxide. Second, carbon nanotube electrodes preloaded with sodium peroxide are utilized. Third, sodium peroxide is dissolved in the electrolyte to enhance precipitation of solid sodium peroxide. Interestingly, all approaches yield sodium superoxide as a discharge product. Thus, it might not be possible to have high energy density sodium–oxygen batteries with sodium peroxide as the discharge product. However, potential pathways for peroxide formation during discharge have been excluded to help to find the true factors that govern the competition between superoxide and peroxide formation.",Energy Technology

Herein, pure S nanosheet cathodes can be grown in situ on three-dimensional Cu foam substrate with the condensation between binary polymeric binders, serving as a model system to investigate the formation and electrochemical mechanism of unique S nanosheets on the Cu current collectors. On the basis of the confirmed conversion reactions to Na2S, The constructed cathode exhibits ultrahigh initial discharge/charge capacity of 3189/1403 mAh g-1.

Reactive Precipitation of Anhydrous Alkali Sulfide Nanocrystals with Concomitant Abatement of Hydrogen Sulfide and Cogeneration of Hydrogen,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAnhydrous alkali sulfide (M2S, M=Li or Na) nanocrystals (NCs) are important materials central to the development of next generation cathodes and solid-state electrolytes for advanced batteries, but not commercially available at present. This work reports an innovative method to directly synthesize M2S NCs through alcohol-mediated reactions between alkali metals and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). In the first step, the alkali metal is complexed with alcohol in solution, forming metal alkoxide (ROM) and releasing hydrogen (H2). Next, H2S is bubbled through the ROM solution, where both chemicals are completely consumed to produce phase-pure M2S NC precipitates and regenerate alcohol that can be recycled. The M2S NCs morphology may be tuned through the choice of the alcohol and solvent. Both synthetic steps are thermodynamically favorable (ΔGmo<−100 kJ mol−1), proceeding rapidly to completion at ambient temperature with almost 100 % atom efficiency. The net result, H2S+2 m→M2S+H2, makes good use of a hazardous chemical (H2S) and delivers two value-added products that naturally phase separate for easy recovery. This scalable approach provides an energy-efficient and environmentally benign solution to the production of nanostructured materials required in emerging battery technologies.",ChemSusChem
Investigation of the Effect of Using Al2O3-Nafion Barrier on Room-Temperature Na-S Batteries,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries are promising battery systems because of their high theoretical capacity, high energy density, and low cost. However, their application is hindered by several issues, especially linked with the polysulfide shuttle effect. Herein, Al2O3-Nafion membrane is used to prevent migration of polysulfides from the cathode side to the anode assisting to lessen the active material loss. While Al2O3 is a very effective adsorbent to trap polysulfides anions, Nafion membrane has cation selectivity which permits migration of Na+ cations and repels polysulfide anions due to the negatively charged sulfonic groups. Thus, an increase in the performance of room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries (RT Na-S batteries) is expected by combining their constructive effects. As a result, higher capacity retention is achieved with ∼250 mAh/g capacities after 100 cycles in the presence of Al2O3-Nafion membrane in contrast to the cell without any interlayer.

Unlike the traditional dual-ion batteries, the operation mechanism of the PDIBs with PTPAn cathode is that the PF6 - ions interacted with the nitrogen atom reversibly in the PTPAn cathode and the K+ ions were intercalated/deintercalated into/from the graphite anode during the charge/discharge process.",ACS Energy Letters
Predicting the Solubility of Sulfur: A COSMO-RS-Based Approach to Investigate Electrolytes for Li–S Batteries,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are, in theory, considering their basic reactions, very promising from a specific energy density point of view, but have poor power rate capabilities. The dissolution of sulfur from the C/S cathode in the electrolyte is a rate-determining and crucial step for the functionality. To date, time-consuming experimental methods, such as HPLC/UV, have been used to quantify the corresponding solubilities. Here, we use a computational fluid-phase thermodynamics approach, the conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS), to compute the solubilities of sulfur in different binary and ternary electrolytes. By using both explicit and implicit solvation approaches for lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimidate (LiTFSI)-containing electrolytes, a deviation of <0.4 log units was achieved with respect to experimental data, within the range of experimental error, thus proving COSMO-RS to be a useful tool for exploring novel Li–S battery electrolytes.",Chemistry - A European Journal
Battery Technologies for Energy Storage,"© 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.The pressing need for green, renewable, alternative energy sources is due to the fast depletion of fossil fuels, increasing demands for energy, and the adverse effects of the use of fossil fuel on the environment. The world is embarking on ambitious solar and wind energy projects, as they can meet future energy requirements. However, supplied energy from these sources is intermittent and weather-dependent. Therefore, it is necessary to store the energy generated from these sources for continuous supply. Thus, electrical storage technologies are essential for both storing excess power and for meeting peak power demands (Tiwari and Mishra, 2011). The leading energy storage technologies include flywheels, superconducting magnetic energy storage, compressed air energy storage, water electrolysis and electrochemical energy storage devices such as batteries (Alotto et al., 2014). However, high installation costs and poor efficiency are the major limitations of their widespread use. Batteries and electrochemical capacitors can be cost-effective and allow for flexibility in deployment. Battery technologies are also ideal for transportation where instant power needs to be available for the vehicle for reasonable lengths of time. They are inexpensive and ensure high levels of safety, reliability, and durability. They come in various sizes and capacities, suitable for stationary and portable applications over a broad spectrum of human activity (Dunn et al., 2011).",Encyclopedia of Sustainable Technologies
Partial electronic conductivity of nanocrystalline Na2O2,"© 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.Understanding charge carrier transport in Na2O2, being one of the possible storage materials in the non-aqueous Na-O2 battery, is key to the development of this type of energy storage system. The electronic and dynamic properties of Na2O2 are expected to greatly influence the overall performance and reversibility of the discharge process. Thus far experimental studies on this topic are rare. To measure the extremely low conductivities setups with sufficiently high sensitivity are needed. Here we studied the partial electronic conductivity σeon of nanocrystalline Na2O2 by potentiostatic polarization measurements which we carried out at room temperature. σeon turned out to be in the order of 8.8 × 10-14 S cm-1; with a very poor total conductivity of σtotal = 17 × 10-14 S cm-1 we obtained σtotal/σeon ≈ 2 clearly showing that ionic transport of Na ions is strongly coupled to electronic dynamics.",Materials Research Express
Structure-designed synthesis of FeS2@C yolk-shell nanoboxes as a high-performance anode for sodium-ion batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.Pyrite (FeS2) is an attractive anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with a high theoretical capacity of 894 mAh g-1. However, its practical application is greatly hindered by the rapid capacity fading caused by the large volume expansion upon sodiation. Tuning the morphology and structure at nanoscale and applying a higher cut-off voltage are essential to address this issue. Here, a facile etching method coupled with a novel sulfidation-in-nanobox strategy is developed to synthesize unique FeS2@C yolk-shell nanoboxes. The as-obtained FeS2@C nanoboxes reveal excellent sodium storage performance. The remarkable electrochemical properties are attributed to the elaborate yolk-shell nanoarchitecture. In particular, it delivers a high specific capacity of 511 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 100 cycles. Furthermore, a high specific capacity of 403 mAh g-1 even at 5 A g-1 is delivered.

One of the major challenges of lithium–sulfur batteries is the problem of polysulfide shuttling between the electrodes, which leads to self-discharge and loss of active material. Here we present an optical diagnostic for quantitative in situ measurements of lithium polysulfides using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Simulated infrared spectra of lithium polysulfide molecules were generated using computational quantum chemistry routines implemented in Gaussian 09. The theoretical spectra served as a starting point for experimental characterization of lithium polysulfide solutions synthesized by the direct reaction of lithium sulfide and sulfur. Attenuated total reflection FT-IR spectroscopy was used to measure absorption spectra. The lower limit of detection with this technique is 0.05 M. Measured spectra revealed trends with respect to polysulfide order and concentration, consistent with theoretical predictions, which were used to develop a set of equations relating the order and concentration of lithium polysulfides in a sample to the position and area of a characteristic infrared absorption band. The diagnostic routine can measure the order and concentration to within 5% and 0.1 M, respectively.",Applied Spectroscopy
β-FeOOH on carbon nanotubes as a cathode material for Na-ion batteries,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted extensive attention in recent years. However, the large volume change of cathode materials during the charge and discharge processes impedes the progress and application of SIBs. In this paper, three-dimensional (3D) tetsubo-like Beta-iron oxy-hydroxide (β-FeOOH) nano-cuboids on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are synthesized by a simple solution method and used as cathode for SIBs. The β-FeOOH exhibits a (2×2) tunnel-type configuration, which can provide huge space for reversible sodium. The radial distribution of β-FeOOH nano-cuboids on the CNTs provides plenty cushion space and sufficient contact area with electrolyte during charge and discharge processes. Furthermore, the CNTs can enhance the electric conductivity and prevent the nanocomposite from agglomeration. Benefiting from the unique structure, the hybridization nanocomposite delivers a high initial discharge capacity (271 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1), long cycle life (120 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles with ~0.1% capacity decay per cycle at 120 mA g−1) and high rate performance (118 mA h g−1 at a current density of 240 mA g−1). These results indicate that the β-FeOOH@CNTs nanocomposite electrode may be a promising candidate for SIBs. Our work may provide a new way to construct and design high-performance cathode electrode materials for SIBs and related systems.",Energy Storage Materials
Freestanding carbon fiber cloth/sulfur composites for flexible room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2017Carbon fiber cloth/sulfur (CFC/S) composites were prepared by loading sulfur in the carbon fiber cloth (CFC) that was obtained by carbonizing the renewable cotton cloth. The CFC/S composites are the excellent cathodes of room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries due to their three-dimensional (3D) interconnected network and high electrolyte uptake of 1156%. The CFC/S composite with area sulfur loading of 2 mg cm−2 displays an initial discharge capacity of 390 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C=1675 mA g−1) and a capacity of 120 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles with tetra ethylene glycol dimethyl ether liquid electrolyte. Furthermore, since the freestanding CFC/S composites exhibit good flexibility and conductivity, they can serve as the cathodes of flexible RT Na-S batteries. As a proof of concept, the soft-packaged RT Na-S batteries were fabricated. The capacity of soft-packaged RT Na-S batteries can remain stable when the batteries are bent.",Energy Storage Materials
Large-scale synthesis of highly uniform Fe1−xS nanostructures as a high-rate anode for sodium ion batteries,"© 2017As a potential alternative to the prevailing lithium ion batteries, the application of sodium (Na) ion batteries (NIBs) in renewable energy and smart grid have revitalized research interest for large-scale energy storage. One of the roadblocks hindering their future commercialization is the development of suitable anode materials. Herein, we present the large-scale preparation of highly uniform iron sulfide (Fe1−xS) nanostructures by a cost-effective and versatile one-step sulfurization strategy. Impressively, as a high-rate and viable sodium-ion anode, the as-prepared Fe1−xS nanostructure manifests appealing electrochemical performance (a high discharge capacity of 563 mA h g−1 over 200 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and outstanding cycling stability even at high rate of 10 A g−1 up to 2000 cycles). Moreover, the proven pseudocapacitance contribution interprets the unprecedented rate capability. Meanwhile, the sodium storage mechanism in the as-prepared samples has also been investigated by using the in-situ X-ray diffraction techniques. Remarkably, a full cell based on Na0.6Co0.1Mn0.9O2 cathode and Fe1−xS anode deliver high discharge capacity (393 mA h g−1) and superior cycling stability.",Nano Energy
"Lithium garnets: Synthesis, structure, Li+ conductivity, Li+ dynamics and applications","© 2017 Elsevier LtdInorganic solid fast Li+ conductors based batteries are expected to overcome the limitations over safety concerns of flammable organic polymer electrolytes based Li+ batteries. Hence, an all-solid-state Li+ battery using non-flammable solid electrolyte have attracted much attention as next-generation battery. Therefore, in the development of all-solid-state lithium rechargeable batteries, it is important to search for a solid electrolyte material that has high Li+ conductivity, low electronic conductivity, fast charge transfer at the electrode interface and wide electrochemical window stability against potential electrodes and lithium metal. Hence, significant research effort must be directed towards developing novel fast Li+ conductors as electrolytes in all-solid-state lithium batteries. Among the reported inorganic solid Li+ conductive oxides, garnet-like structural compounds received considerable attention in recent times for potential application as electrolytes in all-solid-state lithium batteries. The focus of this review is to provide comprehensive overview towards the importance of solid fast lithium ion conductors, advantages of lithium garnets over other ceramic lithium ion conductors and understanding different strategies on synthesis of lithium garnets. Attempts have also been made to understand relationship between the structure, Li+ conduction and Li+ dynamics of lithium garnets. The status of lithium garnets as solid electrolyte in electrochemical devices like all-solid state lithium battery, lithium-air battery and sensor are also discussed.",Progress in Materials Science
100 K cycles: Core-shell H-FeS@C based lithium-ion battery anode,"© 2017Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are still suffering from the issues of low capacity, limited lifespan and poor rate performance. To address these issues, FeS-hollow core-shell structure with ultrathin carbon coated composite (H-FeS@C) were synthesized and used for high rate LIBs. The ultra-thin carbon matrix wrapped on the surface of FeS can enhance the electric conductivity and protect the electrode, while the hollow structure can adjust large volume expansion during cycling. Benefiting from its unique structure, the H-FeS@C core-shell composite delivers high capacity, remarkable cycling stability (with reversible capacity of 100 mA h g-1 after 100 K cycles at 80,000 mA g-1) and high rate performance. Moreover, when charging at 200 mA g-1 and discharging at 10,000 mA g-1, the battery delivers a reversible capacity of 540 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles with capacity retention of 86%. The superior electrochemical properties of H-FeS@C may provide a new method for designing new materials with high rate and long-term stability.",Energy Storage Materials
CuV2S4: A High Rate Capacity and Stable Anode Material for Sodium Ion Batteries,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The ternary compound CuV2S4 exhibits an excellent performance as anode material for sodium ion batteries with a high reversible capacity of 580 mAh g-1 at 0.7 A g-1 after 300 cycles. A Coulombic efficiency of ≈99% is achieved after the third cycle. Increase of the C-rate leads to a drop of the capacity, but a full recovery is observed after switching back to the initial C-rate. In the early stages of Na uptake first Cu+ is reduced and expelled from the electrode as nanocrystalline metallic Cu. An increase of the Na content leads to a full conversion of the material with nanocrystalline Cu particles and elemental V embedded in a Na2S matrix. The formation of Na2S is evidenced by 23Na MAS NMR spectra and X-ray powder diffraction. During the charge process the nanocrystalline Cu particles are retained, but no crystalline materials are formed. At later stages of cycling the reaction mechanism changes which is accompanied by the formation of copper(I) sulfide. The presence of nanocrystalline metallic Cu and/or Cu2S improves the electrical conductivity, leading to superior cycling and rate capability.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
All-Solid-State Na/S Batteries with a Na3PS4 Electrolyte Operating at Room Temperature,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Bulk-type all-solid-state Na/S cells, which are expected to have high capacity, be highly safe, and have low material cost, were fabricated using a Na3PS4 glass-ceramic as a solid electrolyte. The sulfur composite electrodes were prepared by mechanical milling of sulfur active material, a conductive additive (acetylene black), and a Na3PS4 glass-ceramic electrolyte. The all-solid-state Na/S cells used the reaction up to the final discharge product of sulfur active material, Na2S, and achieved a high capacity of ∼1100 mAh (g of S)-1 at room temperature. The rate of utilization of sulfur active material was ∼2 times higher than that of high-temperature-operating NAS batteries (commercially available NAS batteries, Na/sintered β″-alumina/S), where Na2Sx melts with bridging sulfurs contribute to redox in the sulfur electrodes. The open circuit potential curve of the discharge process of the Na/S batteries operating at room temperature was similar to that of the NAS batteries operating at high temperatures; X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement indicated that amorphous Na2Sx with a structure similar to the structure of these melts contributed to sulfur redox reaction in the all-solid-state Na/S cells. A galvanostatic intermittent titration technique and impedance measurement suggested that the overpotential during the discharge process in the all-solid-state Na/S cells was mainly derived from the sodium diffusion resistance in the solid sulfur active material. The finding would be an effective guide for achieving higher performance for all-solid-state Na/S cells.",Chemistry of Materials
Sodium-ion batteries: Present and future,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.Energy production and storage technologies have attracted a great deal of attention for day-to-day applications. In recent decades, advances in lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology have improved living conditions around the globe. LIBs are used in most mobile electronic devices as well as in zero-emission electronic vehicles. However, there are increasing concerns regarding load leveling of renewable energy sources and the smart grid as well as the sustainability of lithium sources due to their limited availability and consequent expected price increase. Therefore, whether LIBs alone can satisfy the rising demand for small- and/or mid-to-large-format energy storage applications remains unclear. To mitigate these issues, recent research has focused on alternative energy storage systems. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as the best candidate power sources because sodium is widely available and exhibits similar chemistry to that of LIBs; therefore, SIBs are promising next-generation alternatives. Recently, sodiated layer transition metal oxides, phosphates and organic compounds have been introduced as cathode materials for SIBs. Simultaneously, recent developments have been facilitated by the use of select carbonaceous materials, transition metal oxides (or sulfides), and intermetallic and organic compounds as anodes for SIBs. Apart from electrode materials, suitable electrolytes, additives, and binders are equally important for the development of practical SIBs. Despite developments in electrode materials and other components, there remain several challenges, including cell design and electrode balancing, in the application of sodium ion cells. In this article, we summarize and discuss current research on materials and propose future directions for SIBs. This will provide important insights into scientific and practical issues in the development of SIBs.",Chemical Society Reviews
High-Capacity and Ultrafast Na-Ion Storage of a Self-Supported 3D Porous Antimony Persulfide-Graphene Foam Architecture,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The key challenge for high-performance sodium-ion batteries is the exploitation of appropriate electrode materials with a long cycling stability and high rate capability. Here, we report Sb2S5 nanoparticles (∼5 nm) uniformly encapsulated in three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene foam, which were fabricated by a facile hydrothermal coassembly strategy, as a high-performance anode material for sodium-ion batteries. The as-prepared composite can be directly used as electrodes without adding a binder or current collector, exhibiting outstanding electrochemical performance with a high reversible capacity (845 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), ultralong cycling life (91.6% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.2 A g-1), and exceptional rate capability (525 mA h g-1 at 10.0 A g-1). This is attributed to fast Na+ ion diffusion from the ultrasmall nanoparticles and excellent electric transport between the active material and 3D porous graphene, which also provide an effective strategy for anchoring the nanoparticles. Experimental results show that the Sb2S5 undergoes a reversible reaction of Sb2S5 + 16Na → 5Na2S + 2Na3Sb during sodiation/desodiation. Moreover, a full cell with Na3(VO0.5)2(PO4)2F2/C cathode and the as-prepared composite anode was assembled, displaying high output voltage (∼2.2 V) with a stable capacity of 828 mA h g-1 for anode material (with 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1), showing the potential for practical application.",Nano Letters
Encapsulation of Metallic Na in an Electrically Conductive Host with Porous Channels as a Highly Stable Na Metal Anode,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Room-temperature Na ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted great attention because of the widely available, abundant sodium resources and potentially low cost. Currently, the challenge of the NIB development is due primarily to the lack of a high-performance anode, while the Na metal anode holds great promise considering its highest specific capacity of 1165 mA h/g and lowest anodic potential. However, an uneven deposit, relatively infinite volume change, and dendritic growth upon plating/stripping cycles cause a low Coulombic efficiency, poor cycling performance, and severe safety concerns. Here, a stable Na carbonized wood (Na-wood) composite anode was fabricated via a rapid melt infusion (about 5 s) into channels of carbonized wood by capillary action. The channels function as a high-surface-area, conductive, mechanically stable skeleton, which lowers the effective current density, ensures a uniform Na nucleation, and restricts the volume change over cycles. As a result, the Na-wood composite anode exhibited flat plating/stripping profiles with smaller overpotentials and stable cycling performance over 500 h at 1.0 mA/cm2 in a common carbonate electrolyte system. In sharp comparison, the planar Na metal electrode showed a much shorter cycle life of 100 h under the same test conditions.",Nano Letters
Multichannel Porous TiO2 Hollow Nanofibers with Rich Oxygen Vacancies and High Grain Boundary Density Enabling Superior Sodium Storage Performance,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimTiO2 as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) has attracted much recent attention, but poor cyclability and rate performance remain problematic owing to the intrinsic electronic conductivity and the sluggish diffusivity of Na ions in the TiO2 matrix. Herein, a simple process is demonstrated to improve the sodium storage performance of TiO2 by fabricating a 1D, multichannel, porous binary-phase anatase-TiO2–rutile-TiO2 composite with oxygen-deficient and high grain-boundary density (denoted as a-TiO2− x/r-TiO2− x) via electrospinning and subsequent vacuum treatment. The introduction of oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 matrix enables enhanced intrinsic electronic conductivity and fast sodium-ion diffusion kinetics. The porous structure offers easy access of the liquid electrolyte and a short transport path of Na+ through the pores toward the TiO2 nanoparticle. Furthermore, the high density of grain boundaries between the anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 offer more interfaces for a novel interfacial storage. The a-TiO2− x/r-TiO2− x shows excellent long cycling stability (134 mAh g−1 at 10 C after 4500 cycles) and superior rate performance (93 mAh g−1 after 4500 cycles at 20 C) for sodium-ion batteries. This simple and effective process could serve as a model for the modification of other materials applied in energy storage systems and other fields.",Small
"Porous Amorphous Co2P/N,B-Co-doped Carbon Composite as an Improved Anode Material for Sodium-Ion Batteries","© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) represent a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries, owing to the much higher abundance and lower cost of sodium resources in comparison with lithium. However, the electrode materials of SIBs usually suffer from more severe issues, such as low specific capacity and poor cyclability, owing to the much larger Na+ diameter and drastic volumetric variations during sodiation/desodiation. Hence, it is still a huge challenge to develop superior electrode materials for reversible Na storage. In comparison with the crystalline materials conventionally used in batteries, amorphous ones may offer a more stable framework for the uptake of Na. To address these issues, a porous composite composed of amorphous Co2P and N,B-co-doped carbon (A-Co2P/CxNyBz-650) is prepared by controlling the annealing temperature at 650 °C after freeze-drying the precursors. As-prepared A-Co2P/CxNyBz-650 exhibits much better Na-storage properties in terms of higher Na-storage capacity, longer cycling stability, and excellent rate performance compared with the crystalline counterparts. These may benefit from the fact that the amorphous framework can provide easier Na+ accessibility and better strain accommodation, originating from volumetric variations during sodiation/desodiation. More importantly, the electrolyte for all of the electrochemical tests are NaPF6 based, which is more accessible for practical applications because of its higher safety compared with the commonly used NaClO4-based electrolyte.",ChemElectroChem
Na3V2(PO4)3/C/Ag nanocomposite materials for Na-ion batteries obtained by the modified Pechini method,"© 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Nanocomposite materials, Na3V2(PO4)3/C and Na3V2(PO4)3/C/Ag, were synthesized by a modified Pechini method. Their properties were characterized with the use of the X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, Raman spectroscopy, impedance spectroscopy, and charge-discharge tests as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The discharge capacity of Na3V2(PO4)3/C obtained at 600 °C was 116.1 and 75 mAh g−1 at a current density of 11 (0.1 C) and 110 mA g−1 (1 С) in the potential range of 2.7–3.8 V. The high capacity values for fast charge/discharge were achieved as a result of heat treatment by two steps and incorporation of appropriate amount of silver particles into Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanocomposite. The discharge capacities of thus obtained Na3V2(PO4)3/C with 0.2 wt% of Ag were 117.2, 112.5, and 83.5 mAh g−1 at the current densities of 11, 110, and 880 mA g−1. This experimental evidence reveals the great potential of NVP/C/Ag synthesized by the modified Pechini method as cathode materials for the production of sodium-ion batteries.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry

High-Performance All-Inorganic Solid-State Sodium-Sulfur Battery,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.All-inorganic solid-state sodium-sulfur batteries (ASSBs) are promising technology for stationary energy storage due to their high safety, high energy, and abundant resources of both sodium and sulfur. However, current ASSB shows poor cycling and rate performances mainly due to the huge electrode/electrolyte interfacial resistance arising from the insufficient triple-phase contact among sulfur active material, ionic conductive solid electrolyte, and electronic conductive carbon. Herein, we report an innovative approach to address the interfacial problem using a Na3PS4-Na2S-C (carbon) nanocomposite as the cathode for ASSBs. Highly ionic conductive Na3PS4 contained in the nanocomposite can function as both solid electrolyte and active material (catholyte) after mixing with electronic conductive carbon, leading to an intrinsic superior electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact because only a two-phase contact is required for the charge transfer reaction. Introducing nanosized Na2S into the nanocomposite cathode can effectively improve the capacity. The homogeneous distribution of nanosized Na2S, Na3PS4, and carbon in the nanocomposite cathode could ensure a high mixed (ionic and electronic) conductivity and a sufficient interfacial contact. The Na3PS4-nanosized Na2S-carbon nanocomposite cathode delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 869.2 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 with great cycling and rate capabilities at 60 °C, representing the best performance of ASSBs reported to date and therefore constituting a significant step toward high-performance ASSBs for practical applications.",ACS Nano
Ball-in-cage nanocomposites of metal-organic frameworks and three-dimensional carbon networks: Synthesis and capacitive performance,"© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.In order to improve the electrical conductivity of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which have drawn remarkable attention owing to their potential application in the energy storage field, a Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) polyhedron was in situ integrated into a three-dimensional carbon network (3DCN) to construct a Ball-in-Cage (BIC) nanostructure. The introduced 3DCN acting as the electronic pathway can provide nucleation sites for MOF particles; consequently, further growth of the MOF particles is limited by the size effect of 3DCN. The BIC frame not only controls the MOF particle size, but also ensures a high electron conductivity of the entire structure. The as-prepared BIC electrode displays an outstanding capacitance of 119 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 and a great rate performance as well, which can be expected to be a promising approach to enhance the electrochemical performance of pristine MOFs in the future.",Nanoscale
LiO2: Cryosynthesis and Chemical/Electrochemical Reactivities,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The reduction of O2 to solid Li2O2, via the intermediates O2 - and LiO2, is the desired discharge reaction at the positive electrode of the aprotic Li-O2 batteries. In practice, a plethora of byproducts are identified together with Li2O2 and have been assigned to the side reactions between the reduced oxygen species (O2 -, LiO2, and Li2O2) and the battery components (the cathode and electrolyte). Understanding the reactivity of these reduced oxygen species is critical for the development of stable battery components and thus high cycle life. O2 - and Li2O2 are readily available, and their reactivities have been studied in depth both experimentally and theoretically. However, little is known about LiO2, which readily decomposes to Li2O2 and is thus unavailable under usual laboratory conditions. Here we report the synthesis and reactivity of LiO2 in liquid NH3 at cryogenic temperatures and conclude that LiO2 is the most reactive oxygen species in Li-O2 batteries.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters
Origin of Outstanding Phase and Moisture Stability in a Na3P1-xAsxS4 Superionic Conductor,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Sodium ion (Na) solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are critical to address notorious safety issues associated with liquid electrolytes used in the current Na ion batteries. Fulfilling multiple innovations is a grand challenge but is imperative for advanced Na ion SSEs, such as a combination of high ionic conductivity and excellent chemical stability. Here, our first-principles and phonon calculations reveal that Na3P1-xAsxS4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) is a solid-state superionic conductor stabilized at 0 K by zero-point vibrational energy and at finite temperatures by vibrational and configurational entropies. Especially, our integrated first-principles and experimental approach indicates that Na3P1-xAsxS4 is dry-air stable. Additionally, the alloying element arsenic greatly enhances the moisture (i.e., H2O) stability of Na3P1-xAsxS4 by shifting the reaction products from the easy-forming oxysulfides (such as Na3POS3 and Na3PO2S2 with H2S release) to the difficult-forming hydrates (such as Na3P1-xAsxS4·nH2O with n = 8 and/or 9) due mainly to a weaker As-O affinity compared to that of P-O. The present work demonstrates that alloying is able to achieve multiple innovations for solid-state electrolytes, such as a desirable superionic conductor with not only a high ionic conductivity (for example, 1.46 mS/cm at room temperature achieved in Na3P0.62As0.38S4) but also an excellent chemical stability with respect to temperature, composition, and moisture.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

A Novel Potassium-Ion-Based Dual-Ion Battery,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimIn this work, combining both advantages of potassium-ion batteries and dual-ion batteries, a novel potassium-ion-based dual-ion battery (named as K-DIB) system is developed based on a potassium-ion electrolyte, using metal foil (Sn, Pb, K, or Na) as anode and expanded graphite as cathode. When using Sn foil as the anode, the K-DIB presents a high reversible capacity of 66 mAh g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 over the voltage window of 3.0–5.0 V, and exhibits excellent long-term cycling performance with 93% capacity retention for 300 cycles. Moreover, as the Sn foil simultaneously acts as the anode material and the current collector, dead load and dead volume of the battery can be greatly reduced, thus the energy density of the K-DIB is further improved. It delivers a high energy density of 155 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 116 W kg−1, which is comparable with commercial lithium-ion batteries. Thus, with the advantages of environmentally friendly, cost effective, and high energy density, this K-DIB shows attractive potential for future energy storage application.",Advanced Materials

Optimization of porous polymer electrolyte for quasi-solid-state electrical double layer supercapacitor,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdWe report the poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexfluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) based porous polymer electrolyte membranes, prepared via phase-inversion/solvent-nonsolvent methods, activated with an organic liquid electrolyte ethylene carbonate (EC):propylene carbonate (PC)-NaClO4 for the application in electric double layer capacitor (EDLC). The simple, quick and environment-friendly phase-inversion method, involving condensing steam as non-solvent, has been taken as the optimized process to obtain the porous PVdF-HFP film. The films of porous PVdF-HFP and the electrolyte (after soaking with liquid electrolyte) have been characterized for their morphological/structural aspects, porosity, liquid electrolyte retention, interaction with electrolyte, thermal properties, electrochemical stability and ionic conductivity. A pore-formation mechanism during phase-inversion at 100 °C has been proposed on the basis of thermal studies. The electrolyte film has been found to have excellent mechanical flexibility, porosity (∼80%), electrolyte retention (∼400%), ionic conductivity (∼2 mS cm−1 at room temperature), and electrochemical stability window (ESW) of ∼4.35 V. The EDLC, fabricated with activated carbon electrodes and porous polymer electrolyte, exhibits excellent performance characteristics in terms of the specific capacitance (∼150 F g−1, evaluated from EIS), specific energy (∼17.7 Wh kg−1) and specific power (14.3 kW kg−1).

A new energy storage system: Rechargeable potassium-selenium battery,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdA new reversible and high-performance potassium-selenium (K-Se) battery, using confined selenium/carbonized-polyacrylonitrile (PAN) composite (c-PAN-Se) as cathode and metallic potassium as anode, is reported in this work. The PAN-derived carbon matrix could effectively confine the small Se molecules and provide a sufficient buffer for the volume changes. The reversible formation of small-molecule trigonal Se (Se1, P3121) phase could essentially inhibit the formation of polyselenides and account for outstanding electrochemical performance. The carbonate-based electrolyte further synergistically diminishes the shuttle effect by inhibiting the formation of polyselenides in the meantime. The as-prepared K-Se battery shows a reversible capacity of 1904 mAh cm−3after 100 cycles at 0.2 C and rate retention of 89% from 0.1 to 2 C. In addition, the charge-discharge mechanism is also investigated via the combination of in-situ and ex-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy analysis. The results reveal that the introduction of K+ions leads to the cleavage of C-Se bonds, the rearrangement of selenium atoms, and the final formation of the main product K2Se. Moreover, the reversible formation of trigonal Se (Se1, P3121) phase was detected in the reaction with K+. These findings not only can advance our understanding of this family of batteries, but also provide insight into chemically-bonded selenium composite electrodes, which could give guidance for scientific research and the optimization of Se and S electrodes for the K-S, Na-S, Li-S, Na-Se, and Li-Se batteries.",Nano Energy
"Cooperatively assembled, nitrogen-doped, ordered mesoporous carbon/iron oxide nanocomposites for low-cost, long cycle life sodium-ion batteries","© 2017 Elsevier LtdSingle pot, multi-component assembly of resol (carbon source), Pluronic F127, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), dicyandiamide (nitrogen source) and iron nitrate (iron oxide source) yields nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon/iron oxide nanocomposites on carbonization. Etching the silica derived from the TEOS generates micropores in the carbon framework. The incorporation of iron oxide and nitrogen doping of the carbon tends to decrease the surface area; at approximately 3.7 wt% nitrogen and 21 wt% iron oxide (OMC-3.7-21), the surface area decreases from 2162 m2/g for the undoped ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) to 974 m2/g and the pore volume decreases from 1.62 cm3/g to 0.6 cm3/g due to deformation of the nanostructure by crystallization of γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and N-doping of the carbon. Despite the decreased surface area, the reversible capacity when used as anodes in a sodium ion battery is increased from 110 mAh/g (undoped OMC) to 275 mAh/g (OMC-3.7-21) due to high capacity from the γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and the improved capacity associated with nitrogen doping of carbon. These nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon/iron oxide nanocomposites exhibit good cycle stability with almost 99% capacity retention after 350 charge/discharge cycles. The combination of low-cost and excellent electrochemical performance makes these mesoporous nanocomposites promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",Carbon
Kinetics and Degradation Processes of CuO as Conversion Electrode for Sodium-Ion Batteries: An Electrochemical Study Combined with Pressure Monitoring and DEMS,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Copper oxide (CuO) can be used as electrode material for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries; however, the path toward application for rechargeable systems is still long. This is mainly related to the complex nature of the electrode reaction and to aging mechanisms that are not well understood, especially in the case of sodium. The main subject of this paper is to compare the electrode reaction of CuO in lithium (CuO/Li) and sodium (CuO/Na) half-cells and to study side reactions in the CuO/Na system by means of differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and in situ pressure monitoring during galvanostatic cycling (PMGC). Electrode processes have been studied at different current densities and temperatures. In CuO/Li cells, CuO and Cu2O form during charging, their respective fraction depending on the current density. In case of CuO/Na, Cu2O is always the charging product although oxidation to CuO can be temporarily achieved by increasing the temperature to 50°C. The difference between both CuO/Na and CuO/Li is related to the electrode volume expansion/shrinkage during cycling. Differences in the temporal evolution of electrode surface films are followed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For the CuO/Na system, PMGC and DEMS studies reveal a periodic release of gaseous side products as a result of a slow but likely continuous electrolyte degradation. This degradation is due to the repeated formation of a surface film (discharge) and its partial dissolution (charge) accompanied by the release of H2 and CO2. The degradation processes fade during cycling but remain dynamic. This means that a long cycle life of CuO electrodes in sodium-ion batteries can likely be only achieved by employing some excess electrolyte.

Because of the high specific surface area of 967 m2 g-1, as well as 51.8% of the pore volume is contributed by ultramicropore with pore size less than 0.7 nm, sulfur cathode exhibits superior electrochemical behavior in carbonate-based electrolyte with a capacity of 507.9 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 2 C in Li-S batteries and 392 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 1 C in Na-S batteries, respectively.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Halogenated Sodium-closo-Dodecaboranes as Solid-State Ion Conductors,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Sodium compounds containing large weakly coordinating anions are explored as ion conductors. The halogenated sodium-closo-dodecaboranes (Na2B12Cl12, Na2B12Br12, and Na2B12I12) are all isostructural (Pa3̅) at room temperature. These compounds undergo an order-disorder polymorphic transition to Fm3̅m where Na+ partially occupies two crystallographic sites and [B12X12]2- anions undergo reorientational motion. These dynamic structural properties promote extreme Na+ ion conductivity up to 0.162 S/cm at elevated temperature (500 °C). The polymorphic transition temperatures increase down the halogen group (Cl < Br < I). These temperatures are much higher (475, 525, and 570 °C) than for Na2B12H12 (266 °C), which could be related to increasing anion size, mass, and the anisotropic electron density in the covalently bound halogens (B-X). The halogens may form Na-X interactions with increasing strength and directionality, which restrict dynamic motion until high temperature. The halogenated sodium-closo-dodecaboranes demonstrate excellent thermal stabilities (up to 500 °C) and may facilitate the development of new high temperature ion conductors.",Chemistry of Materials
Atomic Layer Deposited Non-Noble Metal Oxide Catalyst for Sodium–Air Batteries: Tuning the Morphologies and Compositions of Discharge Product,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimCatalysts can play a critical role in the development of sodium–air batteries (SABs). Atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology enables rational design and atomic utilization of catalyst by homogenously distributing catalytically active material on a variety of substrates. Here, a novel hierarchical nanostructured Co3O4 is decorated on carbon nanotubes by ALD (CNT@Co3O4) and used as a catalyst for SABs. CNT@Co3O4 demonstrates better performance and longer cycle life than a mechanically mixed CNT/Co3O4 nanocomposite. Well-dispersed ALD Co3O4 catalyst on CNTs, which serves as functionalized active sites, enables rapid electron exchange and high oxygen reduction/evolution activities. Synchrotron-based X-ray analysis including X-ray absorption near edge structure, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy characterization techniques have been employed to elucidate the activity of Co3O4 and to investigate the nanoscale discharge product distribution found in SABs. This analysis reveals that Co3O4 catalyst can promote the electrochemical decomposition of sodium peroxide, superoxide, and carbonates. The role of the catalyst in SABs is clarified and discussed in detail.",Advanced Functional Materials

Using this solution as the anode, we demonstrate a new rechargeable battery with quinone liquid cathode. It is found that the battery with anthraquinone (AQ) liquid cathode displays long cycle ability, low cost properties.

"Isothermal Sulfur Condensation into Carbon Scaffolds: Improved Loading, Performance, and Scalability for Lithium-Sulfur Battery Cathodes","© 2017 American Chemical Society.Here we demonstrate an isothermal technique that enables rapid vapor infiltration of sulfur into carbon templates to overcome scalability and performance bottlenecks associated with common melt infiltration techniques. Building on straightforward thermodynamic principles of capillary condensation, self-limited sulfur loadings up to 82 wt % can be achieved in as little as 10 min at temperatures between 155 and 175°C. We demonstrate a broad range of device performance criteria using a carbon black-single-walled carbon nanotube binder-free cathode framework, including a side-by-side comparison to melt infiltrated electrodes with 74 wt % loading that shows improved capacity (1015 mAh/g vs 768 mAh/g), ∼92% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, and ∼98% Coulombic efficiency as a result of enhanced uniformity and conductivity. Further, we demonstrate this technique over a range of different electrodes (1) electrodes with high sulfur loading (82 wt %) with high initial discharge capacity of 1340 mAh/g, (2) electrodes with high areal loading of 8 mg/cm2 sulfur with >6.5 mAh/cm2 areal capacity, and (3) electrodes based on carbons with microporous confining pores. Most importantly, this vapor infiltration approach requires over 5x less energy input and enables over 60x greater throughput than standard melt infiltration, enabling integration into roll-to-roll rapid processing schemes without compromising device performance. This technique liberates cost and manufacturing barriers to commercialization of Li-S batteries at larger scales while opening new avenues to infiltrate preformed cathode assemblies with sulfur for assessment at lab scales.

Characteristics of glyme electrolytes for sodium battery: nuclear magnetic resonance and electrochemical study,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdGlyme electrolytes are prepared by dissolving sodium trifluoromethane sulfonate (NaCF3SO3) either in dimetoxyethane (DME) or in diethyleneglycoledimethylether (DEGDME). The solutions, designed for sodium battery applications, are thermally characterized by TGA and studied in terms of transport properties by combining pulse field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG NMR) and electrochemical techniques. Both electrolytes reveal suitable characteristics for sodium batteries, such as ion conductivity of about 10−3 S cm−1, sodium transport number of 0.5, a stable stripping-deposition trend, and electrochemical stability windows extending from 0 to 4 V. However, the more volatile DME leads to a higher ion association degree. The suitability of both electrolytes is then verified in sodium-sulfur cells by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic test. The measurements confirm the reversibility of the sodium-sulfur process, and reveal the expected trend of the sulfur electrode in sodium cell with average working voltage of about 1.8 V, with a higher polarization and lower capacity for the cell using the DME-based electrolyte. Accordingly, the DEGDME-based solution appears to be more suitable for sodium battery applications.",Electrochimica Acta
Design of FeS2@rGO composite with enhanced rate and cyclic performances for sodium ion batteries,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdPyrite (FeS2), a promising potential anode material of sodium-ion batteries for its low cost and abundant mineral sources. The low conductivity, dissolution of soluble polysulfides and severe volume change lead to poor rate performance and terrible cyclic performance, especially for commercial bulk FeS2 material. These are the main handicaps for its large scale application in sodium ion batteries. In this work, we report a well-designed core-shell structured FeS2@rGO composite with two parts that are firmly linked by SiO2 nanoparticles. The introduction of rGO sheets can bring the following advantages: improved conductivity, prevention of loss of polysulfides, and buffering of volume change. Besides, combining the unique structure of FeS2@rGO and the control of cut-off voltage which avoids the formation of polysulfides, this FeS2@rGO composite exhibits improved cyclic and rate performances.

Fluoroethylene Carbonate Additives to Render Uniform Li Deposits in Lithium Metal Batteries,"© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimLithium (Li) metal has been considered as an important substitute for the graphite anode to further boost the energy density of Li-ion batteries. However, Li dendrite growth during Li plating/stripping causes safety concern and poor lifespan of Li metal batteries (LMB). Herein, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additives are used to form a LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The FEC-induced SEI layer is compact and stable, and thus beneficial to obtain a uniform morphology of Li deposits. This uniform and dendrite-free morphology renders a significantly improved Coulombic efficiency of 98% within 100 cycles in a Li | Cu half-cell. When the FEC-protected Li metal anode matches a high-loading LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NMC) cathode (12 mg cm−2), a high initial capacity of 154 mAh g−1 (1.9 mAh cm−2) at 180.0 mA g−1 is obtained. This LMB with conversion-type Li metal anode and intercalation-type NMC cathode affords an emerging energy storage system to probe the energy chemistry of Li metal protection and demonstrates the material engineering of batteries with very high energy density.",Advanced Functional Materials

Cycling at 1C rates reveals retention of over 300 mAh/gS capacity across 1500 cycles with Coulombic efficiency >98% due to microporous sulfur confinement and stability of the sodium metal anode in a glyme-based electrolyte. We show sucrose to be an ideal platform to develop microporous carbon capable of mitigating electrode-electrolyte reactivity and loss of soluble intermediate discharge products.

A class of liquid anode for rechargeable batteries with ultralong cycle life,"© 2017 The Author(s).Low cost, highly efficient and safe devices for energy storage have long been desired in our society.

Ab initio crystal structure prediction of magnesium (poly)sulfides and calculation of their NMR parameters,"© International Union of Crystallography, 2017.Ab initio prediction of sensible crystal structures can be regarded as a crucial task in the quickly-developing methodology of NMR crystallography. In this contribution, an evolutionary algorithm was used for the prediction of magnesium (poly)sulfide crystal structures with various compositions. The employed approach successfully identified all three experimentally detected forms of MgS, i.e. the stable rocksalt form and the metastable wurtzite and zincblende forms. Among magnesium polysulfides with a higher content of sulfur, the most probable structure with the lowest formation energy was found to be MgS2, exhibiting a modified rocksalt structure, in which S2- anions were replaced by S22- dianions. Magnesium polysulfides with even larger fractions of sulfur were not predicted to be stable. For the lowest-energy structures, 25Mg quadrupolar coupling constants and chemical shift parameters were calculated using the density functional theory approach. The calculated NMR parameters could be well rationalized by the symmetries of the local magnesium environments, by the coordination of magnesium cations and by the nature of the surrounding anions. In the future, these parameters could serve as a reference for the experimentally determined 25Mg NMR parameters of magnesium sulfide species.Experimentally observed crystalline forms of MgS were successfully predicted from first principles and an interesting hypothetical structure of MgS2 was identified. For all these forms, 25Mg NMR parameters (chemical shifts and quadrupolar coupling constants) were calculated.",Acta Crystallographica Section C: Structural Chemistry
Ultra-microporous carbons encapsulate small sulfur molecules for high performance lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdLithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are one of the most promising energy storage systems with high energy density. However, they suffer from fast capacity fading due to the shuttle of the dissolved polysulfides. Using small sulfur molecules (S2–4) as cathodes can avoid the shuttle problem, but the preparation of ultra-microporous carbon to encapsulate S2–4 is challenging. Here, we report a Li-S battery with an excellent cycling performance by using a unique ultra-microporous carbon (UMC) with a uniform pore size of 0.55 nm. The UMC was synthesized from PVDF via a facile pyrolysis process to only accommodate small S2–4 molecules and eliminate large S8 molecules. This S/UMC composite electrode is compatible with the carbonate-based electrolyte used in Li-S batteries. The resulting battery shows a typical discharging profile with only one long potential plateau because the reductions from cyclo-S8 to dissolved polysulfides and consequence shuttle problem are avoided. The S/UMC composite retains a capacity of about 852 mAh g−1 and Coulombic efficiency approaching 100% after 150 cycles at 0.1 C and delivers a long-term cycling at 1 C for 1000 cycles with only around 0.03% capacity loss per cycle. We also tested this S/UMC composite electrode in Na-S systems and observed similar electrochemical behaviour. These results indicate that the S/UMC composite is a promising candidate as an electrode material in Li-S and Na-S batteries and related systems.",Nano Energy
Flexible catholyte@carbon nanotube film electrode for high-performance lithium sulfur battery,"© 2016 Elsevier LtdA lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery is attracting considerable attention as a next-generation, high-performing battery. In response to the great demand for lightweight, high-capacity batteries, persistent efforts have been made to solve Li-S battery problems such as polysulfide shuttling. In particular, it has become important to develop a flexible battery in portable electronics. In this study, a Li-S battery is made by a catholyte (Li2S6) solution-impregnated carbon nanotube (CNT) film (catholyte@CNT film) with a conductive 3D network structure. The flexibility and electrochemical properties of the prepared Li-S battery are analyzed. The Li-S battery made of the catholyte@CNT film yields an initial discharge capacity of 975 mAh/g and is stable after charge/discharge of 500 cycles. The battery retains more than 95% of its initial capacity even after 1000 cycles of a limited depth of charge/discharge. A pouch cell battery is fabricated to evaluate performance under several bending tests. As a result, it is observed that the battery maintains good open circuit voltage (OCV) despite 1000 repeated deformation tests and exhibits a stable cycling performance both in the folded and unfolded states. These findings suggest that the CNT film is highly suitable for use as an electrode in flexible Li-S batteries.",Carbon
Porous FeS nanofibers with numerous nanovoids obtained by Kirkendall diffusion effect for use as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2016, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Porous FeS nanofibers with numerous nanovoids for use as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries were prepared by electrospinning and subsequent sulfidation. The post-treatment of the as-spun Fe(acac)3-polyacrylonitrile composite nanofibers in an air atmosphere yielded hollow Fe2O3 nanofibers due to Ostwald ripening. The ultrafine Fe2O3 nanocrystals formed at the center of the fiber diffused toward the outside of the fiber via Ostwald ripening. On sulfidation, the Fe2O3 hollow nanofibers were transformed into porous FeS nanofibers, which contained numerous nanovoids. The formation of porosity in the FeS nanofibers was driven by nanoscale Kirkendall diffusion. The porous FeS nanofibers were very structurally stable and had superior sodium-ion storage properties compared with the hollow Fe2O3 nanofibers. The discharge capacities of the porous FeS nanofibers for the 1st and 150th cycles at a current density of 500 mA·g–1 were 561 and 592 mA·h·g–1, respectively. The FeS nanofibers had final discharge capacities of 456, 437, 413, 394, 380, and 353 mA·h·g–1 at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 A·g–1, respectively.

Enhancing the Cycling Stability of Sodium Metal Electrodes by Building an Inorganic-Organic Composite Protective Layer,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Owing to the natural abundance of sodium resources and their low price, next-generation batteries employing an Na metal anode, such as Na-O2 and Na-S systems, have attracted a great deal of interest. However, the poor reversibility of an Na metal electrode during repeated electrochemical plating and stripping is a major obstacle to realizing rechargeable sodium metal batteries. It mainly originates from Na dendrite formation and exhaustive electrolyte decomposition due to the high reactivity of Na metal. Herein, we report a free-standing composite protective layer (FCPL) for enhancing the reversibility of an Na metal electrode by mechanically suppressing Na dendritic growth and mitigating the electrolyte decomposition. A systematic variation of the liquid electrolyte uptake of FCPL verifies the existence of a critical shear modulus for suppressing Na dendrite growth, being in good agreement with a linear elastic theory, and emphasizes the importance of the ionic conductivity of FCPL for attaining uniform Na plating and stripping. The Na-Na symmetric cell with an optimized FCPL exhibits a cycle life two times longer than that of a bare Na electrode.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
A Few-Layer SnS2/Reduced Graphene Oxide Sandwich Hybrid for Efficient Sodium Storage,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.(Figure Presented) Rechargeable sodium-ion batteries have lately received considerable attention as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries because sodium resources are essentially inexhaustible and ubiquitous around the world. Despite recent reports on cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries have shown electrochemical activities close to their lithium-ion counterparts, the major scientific challenge for sodium-ion batteries is to exploit efficient anode materials. Herein, we demonstrate that a hybrid material composed of few-layer SnS2 nanosheets sandwiched between reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets exhibits a high specific capacity of 843 mAh g-1 (calculated based on the mass of SnS2 only) at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 and a 98% capacity retention after 100 cycles when evaluated between 0.01 and 2.5 V. Employing ex situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction techniques, we illustrate the high specific capacity of our anode through a 3-fold mechanism of intercalation of sodium ions along the ab-plane of SnS2 nanosheets and the subsequent formation of Na2S2 and Na15Sn4 through conversion and alloy reactions. The existence of RGO nanosheets in the hybrid material functions as a flexible backbone and high-speed electronic pathways, guaranteeing that an appropriate resilient space buffers the anisotropic dilation of SnS2 nanosheets along the ab-plane and c-axis for stable cycling performance.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C

Anode-Free Sodium Battery through in Situ Plating of Sodium Metal,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been pursued as a more cost-effective and more sustainable alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), but these advantages come at the expense of energy density. In this work, we demonstrate that the challenge of energy density for sodium chemistries can be overcome through an anode-free architecture enabled by the use of a nanocarbon nucleation layer formed on Al current collectors. Electrochemical studies show this configuration to provide highly stable and efficient plating and stripping of sodium metal over a range of currents up to 4 mA/cm2, sodium loading up to 12 mAh/cm2, and with long-term durability exceeding 1000 cycles at a current of 0.5 mA/cm2. Building upon this anode-free architecture, we demonstrate a full cell using a presodiated pyrite cathode to achieve energy densities of ∼400 Wh/kg, far surpassing recent reports on SIBs and even the theoretical maximum for LIB technology (387 Wh/kg for LiCoO2/graphite cells) while still relying on naturally abundant raw materials and cost-effective aqueous processing.",Nano Letters
Insights into the Distinct Lithiation/Sodiation of Porous Cobalt Oxide by in Operando Synchrotron X-ray Techniques and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered as one of the promising power source candidates for the stationary storage industries owing to the much lower cost of sodium than lithium. It is well-known that the electrode materials largely determine the energy density of the battery systems. However, recent discoveries on the electrode materials showed that most of them present distinct lithium and sodium storage performance, which is not yet well understood. In this work, we performed a comparative understanding on the structural changes of porous cobalt oxide during its electrochemical lithiation and sodiation process by in operando synchrotron small angel X-ray scattering, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. It was found that compared to the lithiation process, the porous cobalt oxide undergoes less pore structure changes, oxidation state, and local structure changes as well as crystal structure evolution during its sodiation process, which is attributed to the intrinsic low sodiation activity of cobalt oxide as evidenced by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, it was indicated that the sodiation activity of metal sulfides is higher than that of metal oxides, indicating a better candidate for SIBs. Such understanding is crucial for future design and improvement of high-performance electrode materials for SIBs.",Nano Letters

"Ultra-long cycle life, low-cost room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries enabled by highly doped (N,S) nanoporous carbons","© 2016 Elsevier LtdEfficiency, cost, and lifetime are the primary challenges for stationary energy storage with vanadium-redox flow and sodium-sulfur batteries as promising options. In particular, room temperature sodium-sulfur battery systems offer the potential for safe, simple, low-cost and high energy density storage, but the high reactivity or solubility of sodium polysulfides in common liquid electrolytes for carbonates or glycols, respectively, leads to rapid performance loss on cycling.

This cathode design leads to an ultra-stable room temperature sodium-sulfur battery with less than 3% decay in the discharge capacity after 8000 cycles at a high current density of 4.6 A/g.

Herein, we have developed a new type of functionalized carbon hollow-structured nanospheres based on core-shell copper sulfide@ carbon quantum dots (CQDs)@carbon hollow nanosphere (CHNS) architecture. This CuS@CQDs@C HNS is accomplished by a simple, scalable, in situ single-step hydrothermal method to produce the material that can be employed as an electrode for electrochemical energy storage and photocatalytic applications. Impressively, the CuS@CQDs@C HNS nanostructure delivers exceptional electrochemical energy storage characteristics with high specific capacitance (618 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1) and an excellent rate capability with an extraordinary capacitance (462 F g-1 at current density of 20 A g-1) and long cycle life (95% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles). Further, the proposed photocatalyst exhibited superior photocatalytic activity under solar light due to the efficient electron transfer, which was revealed by photoluminescence studies. Such superior electrochemical and photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the mutual contribution of CuS, CQDs, and CHNS and unique core-shell architecture. These results exhibit that the core-shell CuS@ CQDs@C HNS nanostructure is one of the potential candidates for supercapacitors and photocatalytic applications.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
An Electrolyte for Reversible Cycling of Sodium Metal and Intercalation Compounds,"© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimNa battery chemistries show poor passivation behavior of low voltage Na storage compounds and Na metal with organic carbonate-based electrolytes adopted from Li-ion batteries. Therefore, a suitable electrolyte remains a major challenge for establishing Na batteries. Here we report highly concentrated sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) in dimethoxyethane (DME) electrolytes and investigate them for Na metal and hard carbon anodes and intercalation cathodes. For a DME/NaFSI ratio of 2, a stable passivation of anode materials was found owing to the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface, which was characterized spectroscopically. This permitted non-dentritic Na metal cycling with approximately 98 % coulombic efficiency as shown for up to 300 cycles. The NaFSI/DME electrolyte may enable Na-metal anodes and allows for more reliable assessment of electrode materials in Na-ion half-cells, as is demonstrated by comparing half-cell cycling of hard carbon anodes and Na3V2(PO4)3cathodes with a widely used carbonate and the NaFSI/DME electrolyte.",ChemSusChem
Mechanism of capacity fade in sodium storage and the strategies of improvement for FeS2 anode,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Pyrite FeS2 has attracted extensive interest as anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its high capacity, low cost, and abundant resource. However, the micron-sized FeS2 usually suffers from poor cyclability, which stems from structure collapse, exfoliation of active materials, and sulfur dissolution. Here, we use a synergistic approach to enhance the sodium storage performance of the micron-sized FeS2 through voltage control (0.5−3 V), binder choice, and graphene coating. The FeS2 electrode with the synergistic approach exhibits high specific capacity (524 mA h g−1), long cycle life (87.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles), and excellent rate capability (323 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1). The results prove that a synergistic approach can be applied in the micron-sized sulfides to achieve high electrochemical performance.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
The sudden death phenomena in nonaqueous Na-O2 batteries,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Metal-air (O2) batteries have been intensely studied over the past decade as potential high-energy alternatives to current state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries. Although Li-O2 batteries possess higher theoretical specific energies, Na-O2 cells have been reported to achieve higher capacities on discharge and exhibit much lower overpotentials on charge than analogous Li-O2 cells. Nevertheless, sudden and large overpotential increases (""sudden deaths"") occur in Na-O2 cells on both discharge and charge, substantially limiting achievable capacity on discharge and increasing the average charge voltage, thereby reducing round-trip energy efficiency. In this work, we unravel the origins of these sudden death phenomena, which have been previously linked to the electrochemistry occurring at the cathode. On discharge, the maximum capacity was limited by pore clogging at low current densities and by surface passivation at high current densities, with concentration polarization playing only a small role in limiting the achievable capacity. On charge, the discharge and charge current densities were both found to influence the attainable capacity prior to sudden death. We propose a charge mechanism consistent with our data, where a concerted surface oxidation mechanism and a dissolution-oxidation mechanism both contribute to the observed overpotentials. Sudden death on charge is proposed to occur when these two pathways cannot support the applied current rate.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Fluorine-free electrolytes for all-solid sodium-ion batteries based on percyano-substituted organic salts,"© The Author(s) 2017.A new family of fluorine-free solid-polymer electrolytes, for use in sodium-ion battery applications, is presented. Three novel sodium salts withdiffuse negative charges: sodium pentacyanopropenide (NaPCPI), sodium 2,3,4,5-tetracyanopirolate (NaTCP) and sodium 2,4,5-tricyanoimidazolate (NaTIM) were designed andtested in a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) matrix as polymer electrolytes for anall-solid sodium-ion battery. Due to unique, non-covalent structural configurations of anions, improved ionic conductivities were observed. As an example, ""liquid-like"" high conductivities (>1 mS cm '1) were obtained above 70 °C for solid-polymer electrolyte with a PEO to NaTCP molar ratio of 16:1. All presented salts showed high thermal stability and suitable windows of electrochemical stability between 3 and 5 V. These new anions open a new class of compounds with non-covalent structure for electrolytes system applications.",Scientific Reports

Carbon nanomaterials for na–o 2 batteries,"© 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.The energy policies of many nations contain consumption and distribution models dependent on nonrenewable fossil fuels. There is no doubt that the limited fossil fuel resources will be depleted in the near future if current consumption rates are sustained. The depletion of fossil fuels and its undesirable environmental consequences have quickly become a dilemma faced by the world [1 –3]. To solve the issue of ever-growing emissions and save resources for future generations, several secondary energy storage systems have been developed. Although great progress has been achieved in the development of nickel–cadmium and lead–acid battery technologies in recent years, considerable efforts should be devoted to the exploration of alternative, renewable energy sources [4 –11]. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have dominated the portable electronics market since their first commercialization by Sony in 1991, and are the current state-of-the-art technology for energy storage.",Carbon Nanomaterials for Electrochemical Energy Technologies: Fundamentals and Applications
Carbon nanomaterials for li–o 2 batteries,"© 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.High energy-density rechargeable batteries are crucial for the development of next-generation –electric vehicles (EVs) and large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs). The success of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has contributed to the advancement of several industries, especially that of portable electronic devices. However, the energy density of state-of-the-art LIBs is approaching the theoretical limit, which has proved to be a challenging barrier for the requirements of long-range EVs and ESSs [1 –3]. To address this issue, some new energy storage/conversion systems beyond Li-ion (BLI) batteries have been investigated, including metal–air (metal-O2) and lithium–sulfur batteries [4 –6]. Of all the BLI chemistries, rechargeable Li–O2 batteries are regarded as the most promising battery technology due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density (11,680 Wh kg-1 based on lithium metal), which is comparable to that of gasoline (13,000 Wh kg-1) [5].",Carbon Nanomaterials for Electrochemical Energy Technologies: Fundamentals and Applications
Beyond Li ion: Electrode materials for sodiumand magnesium-ion batteries,"© 2018 by World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.The need for economical and sustainable energy storage drives battery research today. While Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are the most mature technology, scalable electrochemical energy storage applications benefit from reductions in cost and improved safety. Sodium- and magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs) are two technologies that may prove to be viable alternatives. Both metals are cheaper and more abundant than Li, and have better safety characteristics, while divalent magnesium has the added bonus of passing twice as much charge per atom. On the other hand, both are still emerging fields of research with challenges to overcome. For example, electrodes incorporating Na+ are often pulverized under the repeated strain of shuttling the relatively large ion, while insertion and transport of Mg2+ is often kinetically slow, which stems from larger electrostatic forces. This review provides an overview of cathode and anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (NIBS), and a comprehensive summary of research on cathodes for magnesium-ion batteries. In addition, several common experimental discrepancies in the literature are addressed, noting the constraints placed on magnesium electrochemistry. Lastly, promising strategies for future study are highlighted.",Nanomaterials for Energy Conversion and Storage
Synthesis of sodium polysulphide for copper ore processing,"Sodium polysulphide consists of yellow-brown, yellow-green crystals. Its chemical formulas are Na2S2, Na2S3, Na2S4. Currently there are several known methods for the production of sodium sulfide: chemical reduction of sodium sulphate by solid carbonaceous material; reduction of sodium sulfate by gaseous reductant; absorption of hydrogen sulphide with sodium hydroxide; electrolytic (amalgam) method; exchange decomposition of barium sulfide with sulfate, carbonate and sodium hydroxide. In addition to the known methods for the preparation of sodium polysulphide, there are electrochemical methods for the preparation of polysulphides that have been discovered in a long time and have received potentities: an electrochemical method for producing sodium polysulphide, an electrochemical method for producing alkali metal polysulphides. We examined the main standard methods for the preparation of sodium polysulphide, using mechanochemical activation. The mineralogical composition of the ore was analyzed, which allows us to conclude that it is possible to use mechanochemical sulphiding. Synthesis of the sulfidizer was carried out using elemental sulfur, caustic soda and sulphonic acid, in a planetary centrifugal mill mark ""Pulverizette 6 classic line"". Several modifications of sodium polysulphide have been developed, differing in the ratios of the reacting substances that have been tested in the flotation enrichment of the Irtysh deposit. During the testing of various modifications of polysulphides, the best result was revealed which showed an increased copper recovery into the concentrate by 8.98%. To determine the significance of the influence of polysulphide constituents and their consumption on flotation, as well as on the selectivity index, graphical data were presented on the dependence of the change in copper, zinc and selectivity on the ratio of the content in polysulfide: sulfur and caustic sodium, sulfur and sulfonic acid, sodium and sulfonic acid. Based on the data on the approbation of sodium polysulfide in flotation experiments, as well as graphical data, a correlation analysis was performed that showed the best ratio of polysulphide components that would allow higher copper recovery and higher selectivity.",Non-ferrous Metals
Capillary force guided nanomanufacturing of composite materials for advanced battery applications,"Copyright © 2017 ASME.This paper introduces the use of capillary thermodynamics as a powerful nanomanufacturing tool, and its specific application to infiltrate sulfur into 3-D nanostructured electrodes for advanced lithium-sulfur and/or sodium-sulfur battery development. The capillary effect specifically targets nucleation from the equilibrium vapor pressure of bulk sulfur (gas phase) onto nanoscale surfaces (liquid phase). This leads to condensates that nucleate and grow uniformly over the surface leading to self-limited and conformal composite materials moderated by the chemical potential driving force between the nanoscale nuclei and the bulk sulfur. Our studies show highly consistent and repeatable sulfur loading exceeding 80 wt.% sulfur, fast kinetics that can lead to full infiltration in ∼ 10 minutes, and synergy with pre-formed carbon materials including carbon nanotube arrays, carbon nanotube foams and sponges, and microporous carbons with pore sizes ∼ 0.5 nm. This overcomes challenges of scaling to high areal capacity in lithium-sulfur and sodium-sulfur batteries, and our results emphasize the highest reported areal capacities for solidprocessed cathodes to date (> 19 mAh/cm2). This paves the route to batteries with energy density > 500 Wh/kg with reliable manufacturing processes that simultaneously sustain low cost and high throughput.","ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)"
Estimation of electric field effects on the adsorption of molecular superoxide species on Au based on density functional theory,"© the Owner Societies.Superoxide species are key intermediates in the oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) that occur at the cathodes of aprotic metal-air batteries. Herein we report a DFT study of the effects of an externally applied electric field (ε) on the stability of various molecular superoxide species, including MO2 (M = Li, Na, K) and O2-, on gold surfaces, which shows that the stability of such species on Au electrodes can be materially affected by the presence of an electric field and solvent molecules, suggesting that such effects should be included in the first-principles modeling of cathode reactions in metal-O2 cells. In the ε range of ±0.4 V Å-1, the stability of MO2 species is found to vary by up to 0.4 eV on Au(111) and 0.2 eV on Au(211) in vacuo, which is larger than the field effects on the stability of O and OH, key intermediates in the ORR by hydrogen. An aprotic solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), considered here via the inclusion of explicit DMSO molecules above the Au surfaces, stabilizes all three MO2 species at zero fields and amplifies the field effects on the stability of MO2, on both Au surfaces. The variations in the stability of the molecular MO2 species with ε, which have small polarizabilities, are closely approximated by the first-order Stark effect (μ0·ε, where μ0 is the static surface dipole moment induced by adsorption at ε = 0 V Å-1). The superoxide anion (O2-) that has been identified on an under-coordinated Au site has a larger polarizability than the MOx species and a μ0 that is opposite in sign to those of the metal MO2 species, which results in larger errors by the first-order approximation, although its stability varies only moderately under positive electric fields of up to 0.4 V Å-1.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Exceptionally high sodium-ion battery cathode capacity based on doped ammonium vanadium oxide and a full cell SIB prototype study,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.Sodium-ion battery technology, the existing electrodes, and electrolytes are still in the early stage of development, and more intense research is necessary before moving to mass production and application. High capacity and rate capable electrodes are a mandate, and very few combinations of cathode, anode, and electrolyte have been reported with an excellent full cell performance with a long cycle life. Herein, we report for the first time an ultrahigh specific sodium discharge capacity (∼342 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 current rate) and excellent electrochemical performance of a doped ammonium vanadium oxide (NVO) cathode. The cathode performance exhibited >99% capacity retention after 50 cycles at a very high current rate of 2 A g-1. Furthermore, the present report demonstrates the full cell performance with a doped ammonium vanadium oxide (NVO) cathode against a hydrogenated sodium titanium oxide (NTO) anode. The full cell is capable of retaining 94% capacity after 400 cycles and also demonstrated its potential application in an LED-based table lamp. The present study shows a way to produce a rechargeable sodium-ion battery full cell and can be deciphered to facilitate large-scale renewable energy (RE) storage.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
The crystal structure and sodium disorder of high-temperature polymorph β-Na3PS4,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Solid sodium conductors are of great interest as electrolytes for all-solid sodium batteries and also for sodium-sulphur batteries. Here we provide the dynamic structures of crystalline Na3PS4 by high-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. At room temperature, Na3PS4 adopts a tetragonal structure: α-Na3PS4. [Jansen and Henseler, J. Solid State Chem., 1992, 99(1), 110] α-Na3PS4 transforms to a cubic superionic phase β-Na3PS4 at ca. 530 K, but its detailed structure has not been solved so far. The overall structure of β-Na3PS4 is understood as Tl3VS4-type with characteristic spreading of Na distribution, reflecting the dynamic motion of Na. The α to β structural transition involves expansion of bottlenecks of Na migration especially along the tetragonal c axis, and enables three-dimensional ionic transport.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Enhanced cycle performance of quinone-based anodes for sodium ion batteries by attachment to ordered mesoporous carbon and use of ionic liquid electrolyte,"© The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a potential alternative to lithium ion batteries due to their chemical similarities. Key considerations for SIBs include energy storage capacity, lifetime, cost, and safety. Major challenges associated with high performance organic electrodes for rechargeable batteries are their poor electrical conductivity and dissolution of the active material in common electrolytes. The poor conductivity limits the rate performance, while dissolution leads to poor cycle performance and short lifetimes. Here we demonstrate a route to address these challenges in a sodium ion battery for 2,5-disodium-1,4-benzoquinone, Na2DBQ (organic active material), through immobilization of the Na2DBQ on high surface area ordered mesoporous carbon, OMC, and use of 1-methyl-3-propylpyrrolidinium bis(fluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte, NaFSI/[PYR13][FSI]. These changes increase the rate capability and capacity retention after cycling when compared Na2DBQ anodes using standard carbonate electrolytes. At 22◦C, the inclusion of the OMC leads to similar capacities for the IL- and carbonate-electrolytes, but the improved thermal stability of the IL enables safe operation at 60◦C, which more than doubles the discharge capacities due to enhanced ion mobility and charge transfer kinetics. At 60◦C, the capacity retention was 83% for the IL-electrolyte after 300 cycles. For the materials examined here, the use of IL electrolyte does not adversely impact the performance of organic anode sodium-ion batteries and provides advantages with a wider operating temperature range and improved safety when compared to typical carbonate-based electrolytes.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society

Scalable study on nanostructured carbon -sulfur composite electrodes for high energy lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery,"© 2017 The Electrochemical Society.Sulfur is a promising cathode material for lithium sulfur batteries due to its high theoretical capacity (1675 mAh/g). Sulfur cathodes generally suffers from fast capacity degradation and poor Coulombic efficiency originated from the dissolution of intermediate discharge products (polysulfides, L12S) in the electrolyte. The polysulfide dissolution causes loss of active sulfur and suppresses its deep lithiation, which becomes especially severe during slow charge-discharge processes and deteriorates electrochemical performances at low cycling rates. To enhance the electrochemical performance of sulfur, carbon black as conductive material has been dispersed in sulfur. Here we report a scalable study on nanostructured carbon-sulfur (S1-X Cx where x=.25, .35 &.40 etc.) composites as a cathode fabricated by ball-milling technique for lithium sulfur batteries. The characterization of these nanostructured composites have been performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and RAMAN spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of C-sulfur composite cathodes have been found to be enhanced and stable at deep charge-discharge.",ECS Transactions
Harvesting polysulfides by sealing the sulfur electrode in a composite ion-selective net,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.A cathode was prepared by sealing a carbon supported sulfur electrode inside a composite ion-selective net made of carbon, binder and lithiated ionomer to restrict shuttling of polysulfide anionic species. As a result, the soluble polysulfide anions become unable to escape from the composite ion-selective films due to the electrostatic repulsion between the immobilized single ion conducting ionomers and the polysulfides with no dead angles. Experimentally, lithiated 4,4′-difluoro bis(benzene sulfonyl)imide and PEG200 were copolymerized to form a polyether based single ion conducting polymer. The ionic conductivity of the blend film made of ionomer and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) at a mass ratio of 1:1 is 0.57 mS cm−1 at room temperature. The battery capacity with the sealed sulfur electrode is 1412 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C, 1041 mAh g−1 at 1.0 C, 873 mAh g−1 at 2.0 C and 614 mAh g−1 at 5.0 C, significantly better than the results with lithiated Nafion especially at high C rates. In addition, a long cycling test at 2 C for 500 cycles gives rise to a stable capacity of 800 mAh g−1. The intrinsic electrostatic repulsion between polysulfide anions and the negatively charged electrolyte film, together with the overall sealed electrode configuration, is responsible for blocking the shuttling of polysulfides effectively.",Journal of Power Sources
Oriented SnS nanoflakes bound on S-doped N-rich carbon nanosheets with a rapid pseudocapacitive response as high-rate anodes for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.By virtue of abundant sodium resources and low cost, sodium-ion batteries have been considered as a promising candidate compared with the prevailing lithium-ion batteries. However, substantial volume changes and sluggish sodiation kinetics limit their practical application. Here, we designed and prepared a hybrid architecture of oriented tin(ii) sulfide nanoflakes bound on S-doped N-rich carbon nanosheets (SnS/CNS) via a facile sol-gel and hydrothermal route. The functional carbon nanosheets not only strengthen the interaction with SnS, but also enhance the conductivity and pseudocapacitance of the composite. This unique SnS/CNS anode delivers a high reversible capacity of 654 mA h g-1 and excellent rate capabilities of 487 and 250.7 mA h g-1 at current densities of 1 and 20 A g-1, respectively. Further kinetic analyses reveal that the pseudocapacitive contribution accounts for fast Na+ storage at high rates.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
"Modeling of internal mechanical failure of all-solid-state batteries during electrochemical cycling, and implications for battery design","© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.This is the first quantitative analysis of mechanical reliability of all-solid state batteries. Mechanical degradation of the solid electrolyte (SE) is caused by intercalation-induced expansion of the electrode particles, within the constrains of a dense microstructure. A coupled electro-chemo-mechanical model was implemented to quantify the material properties that cause an SE to fracture. The treatment of microstructural details is essential to the understanding of stress-localization phenomena and fracture. A cohesive zone model is employed to simulate the evolution of damage. In the numerical tests, fracture is prevented when electrode-particle's expansion is lower than 7.5% (typical for most Li-intercalating compounds) and the solid-electrolyte's fracture energy higher than Gc = 4 J m-2. Perhaps counter-intuitively, the analyses show that compliant solid electrolytes (with Young's modulus in the order of ESE = 15 GPa) are more prone to micro-cracking. This result, captured by our non-linear kinematics model, contradicts the speculation that sulfide SEs are more suitable for the design of bulk-type batteries than oxide SEs. Mechanical degradation is linked to the battery power-density. Fracture in solid Li-ion conductors represents a barrier for Li transport, and accelerates the decay of rate performance.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Green-low-cost rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries using hollow porous spinel ZnMn2O4 as the cathode material,"© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have been receiving much attention recently due to their potential large-scale applications for energy storage, although only a few cathode materials have been reported as the intercalation hosts for divalent Zn2+ ions. Here, we report competitive ZIBs based on hollow porous ZnMn2O4 as the cathode and zinc as the anode. ZnMn2O4 is firstly prepared through a solvothermal carbon template dispersed by polyvinyl pyrrolidone, followed by an annealing process. The galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement demonstrates that a reversible discharge capacity of 106.5 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 300 cycles can be achieved with no capacity decay after the addition of 0.05 mol L-1 of MnSO4 into the electrolyte. Meanwhile, it exhibits a high capacity of 70.2 mA h g-1 at a large current density of 3200 mA g-1. The excellent cycle and rate performances are attributed to the synergistic effect of the deficient spinel structure of hollow porous ZnMn2O4 with residual carbon distribution and the inhibition of Mn dissolution during the charge/discharge process.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
P2-type transition metal oxides for high performance Na-ion battery cathodes,"© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The particle pulverization induced by volume change and the disproportionation reaction of Mn3+ to Mn4+ and electrolyte-soluble Mn2+ are two major challenges for Na0.67MnO2 cathodes in Na-ion batteries. Herein, Ni and/or Fe doped Na0.67MnO2 was synthesized to suppress the particle pulverization and disproportionation reaction. The replacement of 33% Mn ions by Ni in Na0.67MnO2 can effectively reduce the particle pulverization and disproportionation of Mn3+, resulting in improved cycling stability at the cost of reduced capacity. To develop a high capacity and long cycle life cathode material, Ni in Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is further partially substituted by Fe to generate Na0.67Fe0.20Ni0.15Mn0.65O2, which retains ∼70% of its initial capacity after 900 cycles, corresponding to a very low capacity decay rate of 0.033% per cycle. To the best of our knowledge, the Na0.67Fe0.20Ni0.15Mn0.65O2 synthesized by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) represents one of the best cathode materials for Na-ion batteries to date. In addition, a thin layer (5 nm) of Al2O3 is deposited on the Na0.67MnO2 electrode by atomic layer deposition (ALD) to further reduce the dissolution of Mn ions and accommodate the volume change, which further extend the cycling stability of Na0.67MnO2 electrodes.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
In operando infrared spectroscopy of lithium polysulfides using a novel spectro-electrochemical cell,"© 2017A new in operando spectro-electrochemical Li-S cell has been demonstrated. The novel design allows investigations of the liquid electrolyte phase, in a commercial coin cell geometry, at C rates much higher than conventional in situ cells. We use ATR FT-IR spectroscopy, coupled with a previously developed polysulfide diagnostic to quantify the evolution of lithium polysulfides during the discharge and charge cycles of a Li-S cell. The trends observed in the polysulfide order and concentration with respect to state of charge are consistent with prevailing understanding of the electrochemical mechanisms of Li-S battery operation. During discharge, we observe the reduction of elemental sulfur to dissolved Li2S8 polysulfides, and their cascading conversion to smaller polysulfides until insoluble species (Li2S2 and Li2S) are formed. During cell charging, we observe the oxidation of insoluble polysulfides to larger, soluble polysulfides (Li2Sn, n>3), and infer an eventual recovery of crystalline sulfur, from changes in polysulfides. Long-term evolution of polysulfides is observed over 7 discharge/charge cycles. Capacity fading is evident in the decay of polysulfide order and concentration at the same state of charge between cycles. Sulfur is not recovered by charging the cell in the latter cycles, and the active material is lost as solid Li2S.",Journal of Power Sources
Solid state microwave synthesis of highly crystalline ordered mesoporous hausmannite Mn3O4 films,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.Soft templating using block copolymers provides a generalized synthetic strategy to fabricate mesoporous materials, but it is generally challenging to obtain highly crystalline frameworks without significant deformation or loss of the mesoporous structure. Here, we demonstrate a simple route to generate ordered mesoporous crystalline manganese oxide films by block copolymer templating through microwave processing to convert carbonate precursors to oxides, remove the polymeric template and crystallize the Mn3O4, all within 1 min. The microwave heating in this case is driven primarily by the high microwave cross-section of the substrate (silicon wafer), but manganese oxide also absorbs microwaves to provide energy locally for promoting nucleation/crystallization. Conversely, conventional heating in a muffle furnace at an analogous surface temperature leads to either significant residual copolymer or nanostructure collapse with low crystallinity. This difference in the behavior is attributed to the rapid and local heating of the manganese oxide by microwaves to crystallize the oxide. Microwaves rapidly generate the crystals as evidenced by the invariance in the refractive index of the films after 45 s on further microwave heating. Additionally, the microwave processing leads to nearly twice the specific surface area for the films than that of mesoporous films fabricated by calcination in the furnace. Microwave energy appears to be an attractive alternative to enable the fabrication of a highly crystalline framework in soft-templated ordered mesoporous materials when the microwaves can be absorbed by the framework of interest.",CrystEngComm
Solid state ionics: a Japan perspective,"© 2017 The Author(s). Published by National Institute for Materials Science in partnership with Taylor & Francis.The 70-year history of scientific endeavor of solid state ionics research in Japan is reviewed to show the contribution of Japanese scientists to the basic science of solid state ionics and its applications. The term ‘solid state ionics’ was defined by Takehiko Takahashi of Nagoya University, Japan: it refers to ions in solids, especially solids that exhibit high ionic conductivity at a fairly low temperature below their melting points. During the last few decades of exploration, many ion conducting solids have been discovered in Japan such as the copper-ion conductor Rb4Cu16I7Cl13, proton conductor SrCe1–xYxO3, oxide-ion conductor La0.9Sr0.9Ga0.9Mg0.1O3, and lithium-ion conductor Li10GeP2S12. Rb4Cu16I7Cl13 has a conductivity of 0.33 S cm–1 at 25 °C, which is the highest of all room temperature ion conductive solid electrolytes reported to date, and Li10GeP2S12 has a conductivity of 0.012 S cm–1 at 25 °C, which is the highest among lithium-ion conductors reported to date.

Compatibility issues between electrodes and electrolytes in solid-state batteries,"© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Remarkable success has been achieved in the discovery of ceramic alkali superionic conductors as electrolytes in solid-state batteries; however, obtaining a stable interface between these electrolytes and electrodes is difficult. Only limited studies on the compatibility between electrodes and solid electrolytes have been reported, partially because of the need for expensive instrumentation and special cell designs. Without simple yet powerful tools, these compatibility issues cannot be systematically investigated, thus hindering the generalization of design rules for the integration of solid-state battery components. Herein, we present a methodology that combines density functional theory calculations and simple experimental techniques such as X-ray diffraction, simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis, and electrochemistry to efficiently screen the compatibility of numerous electrode/electrolyte pairs. We systemically distinguish between the electrochemical stability of the solid-state conductor, which is relevant wherever the electrolyte contacts an electron pathway, and the electrochemical stability of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. For the solid electrolyte, we are able to computationally derive an absolute thermodynamic stability voltage window, which is small for Na3PS4 and Na3PSe4, and a larger voltage window which can be kinetically stabilized. The experimental stability, when measured with reliable techniques, falls between these thermodynamic and kinetic limits. Employing a Na solid-state system as an example, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method by finding the most stable system (NaCrO2Na3PS4Na-Sn) within a selected chemical space (more than 20 different combinations of electrodes and electrolytes). Important selection criteria for the cathode, electrolyte, and anode in solid-state batteries are also derived from this study. The current method not only provides an essential guide for integrating all-solid-state battery components but can also significantly accelerate the expansion of the electrolyte/electrode compatibility data.",Energy and Environmental Science
Influence of cations in lithium and magnesium polysulphide solutions: Dependence of the solvent chemistry,"© the Owner Societies 2017.In order to gain a deeper understanding of Li and Mg polysulphides in Li/S and Mg/S batteries, respectively, this work investigates the impact of the two different cations as well as the influence of the electrolyte solvents' relative dielectric permittivity and Gutmann's donor number on the solubility and relative stability of different Li and Mg polysulphide species. Therefore, the disproportionation and dissociation equilibria of chemically prepared ""Li2S8"" and ""MgS8"" solutions in DMSO, DMF, ACN, THF, DME, TEGDME, and Pyr14TFSI are characterized by UV/Vis spectroscopy. Varying the cation and the solvent reveals their mutual interplay in stabilizing different polysulphide species. To our knowledge, this is the first time that chemically synthesized Mg polysulphides in solutions are studied. The results of this work provide essential knowledge for further development of the economically, ecologically, and also in terms of energy density and safety, attractive Mg/S batteries.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Mechanistic origin of low polarization in aprotic Na-O2 batteries,"© the Owner Societies 2017.Research interest in aprotic sodium-air (Na-O2) batteries is growing because of their considerably high theoretical specific energy and potentially better reversibility than lithium-air (Li-O2) batteries. While Li2O2 has been unequivocally identified as the major discharge product in Li-O2 batteries containing relatively stable electrolytes, a multitude of discharge products, including NaO2, Na2O2 and Na2O2·2H2O, have been reported for Na-O2 batteries and the corresponding cathodic electrochemistry remains incompletely understood. Herein, we provide molecular-level insights into the key mechanistic differences between Na-O2 and Li-O2 batteries based on gold electrodes in strictly dry, aprotic dimethyl sulfoxide electrolytes through a combination of in situ spectroelectrochemistry and density functional theory based modeling. While like Li-O2 batteries, the formation of oxygen reduction products (i.e., O2-, NaO2 and Na2O2) in Na-O2 batteries depends critically on the electrode potential, two factors lead to a better reversibility of Na-O2 electrochemistry, and are therefore highly beneficial to a viable rechargeable metal-air battery design: (i) only O2- and NaO2, and no Na2O2, form down to as low as ∼1.5 V vs. Na/Na+ during discharge; (ii) solid NaO2 is quite soluble and its formation and oxidation can proceed through micro-reversible EC (a chemical reaction of the product after the electron transfer) and CE (a chemical reaction preceding the electron transfer) processes, respectively, with O2- as the key intermediate.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Distinct nanoscale reaction pathways in a sulfide material for sodium and lithium batteries,"© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Sodium-ion batteries are attractive because of their potentially lower cost than lithium-ion systems. However, the larger ionic radius of Na+ means that candidate electrode materials often undergo more substantial volumetric changes during reaction as compared to Li-ion batteries, and these changes must be understood and controlled for the development of electrode materials with long cycle life. Here, nanoscale-to-macroscale transformation pathways are investigated in real time in Cu2S (a sulfide electrode material) during electrochemical reaction with Na and Li. In situ and ex situ X-ray diffraction reveal that the overall phase transformations in Cu2S electrodes are similar within both Na and Li cells. However, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that the nanoscale reaction pathways differ significantly, which likely contributes to observed differences in electrochemical behavior. Despite these dissimilarities, Na/Cu2S electrochemical cells are shown to exhibit excellent cycle life for the first time (negligible capacity decay over 400 cycles), which is similar to the Li case. Thus, although the more substantial volume changes during the sodiation of Cu2S induce a new reaction pathway, they do not cause accelerated capacity decay, as is commonly argued for Na-ion materials. These results suggest that other large-volume-change electrode materials may also be engineered for long cycle life in next-generation Na-ion batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Ultrafine nano-sulfur particles anchored on: In situ exfoliated graphene for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The development of lithium-sulfur is impeded by two main obstacles: the dissolution of lithium polysulfides and the pristine insulation of sulfur. Here, high energy ball-milling with the assistance of dielectric barrier discharge plasma was used in synthesis of ultrafine sulfur particles anchored on in situ exfoliated graphene for Li-S batteries. The ultrafine sulfur particles formed not only afford more sufficient electrical contact towards graphene support, but also alleviate volume expansion compared with bulk sulfur. On the other hand, with robust etching function of dielectric barrier discharge plasma, little oxygen-doping was observed in exfoliated few-layer graphene, offering sufficient capture sites towards lithium polysulfides. The ultrafine sulfur/graphene composite with little oxygen-doping exhibits superior cycling performance and rate capability in contrast to the control samples without the exertion of dielectric barrier discharge plasma. Little capacity degradation rate of 0.07% per cycle was achieved at 0.5C over 500 cycles.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Next generation molten NaI batteries for grid scale energy storage,"© 2017Robust, safe, and reliable grid-scale energy storage continues to be a priority for improved energy surety, expanded integration of renewable energy, and greater system agility required to meet modern dynamic and evolving electrical energy demands. We describe here a new sodium-based battery based on a molten sodium anode, a sodium iodide/aluminum chloride (NaI/AlCl3) cathode, and a high conductivity NaSICON (Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12) ceramic separator. This NaI battery operates at intermediate temperatures (120–180 °C) and boasts an energy density of >150 Wh kg−1. The energy-dense NaI-AlCl3 ionic liquid catholyte avoids lifetime-limiting plating and intercalation reactions, and the use of earth-abundant elements minimizes materials costs and eliminates economic uncertainties associated with lithium metal. Moreover, the inherent safety of this system under internal mechanical failure is characterized by negligible heat or gas production and benign reaction products (Al, NaCl). Scalability in design is exemplified through evolution from 0.85 to 10 Ah (28 Wh) form factors, displaying lifetime average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.45% and energy efficiencies of 81.96% over dynamic testing lasting >3000 h. This demonstration promises a safe, cost-effective, and long-lifetime technology as an attractive candidate for grid scale storage.",Journal of Power Sources
The effect of stress on battery-electrode capacity,"© 2017 The Electrochemical Society.Constraint-induced stresses develop during Li-ion battery cycling, because anode and cathode materials expand and contract as they intercalate or de-intercalate Li. We show in this manuscript that these stresses, in turn, can significantly modify the maximum capacity of the device at a given cell voltage. All-solid-state batteries impose an external elastic constraint on electrode particles, promoting the development of large stresses during cycling. We employ an analytic and a finite element model to study this problem, and we predict that the electrode's capacity decreases with increasing matrix stiffness. In the case of lithiation of a silicon composite electrode, we calculate 64% of capacity loss for stresses up to 2 GPa. According to our analysis, increasing the volume ratio of Si beyond 25-30% has the effect of decreasing the total capacity, because of the interaction between neighboring particles. The stress-induced voltage shift depends on the chemical expansion of the active material and on the constraint-induced stress. However, even small voltage changes may result in very large capacity shift if the material is characterized by a nearly flat open-circuit potential curve.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
Boosting the rate capability of hard carbon with an ether-based electrolyte for sodium ion batteries,"© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Hard carbon is considered as the most prospective anode material for sodium ion batteries.

Modeling nucleation and growth of zinc oxide during discharge of primary zinc-air batteries,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.Metal-air batteries are among the most promising next-generation energy storage devices. Relying on abundant materials and offering high energy densities, potential applications lie in the fields of electro-mobility, portable electronics, and stationary grid applications. Now, research on secondary zinc-air batteries is revived, which are commercialized as primary hearing aid batteries. One of the main obstacles for making zinc-air batteries rechargeable is their poor lifetime due to the degradation of alkaline electrolyte in contact with atmospheric carbon dioxide. In this article, we present a continuum theory of a commercial Varta PowerOne button cell. Our model contains dissolution of zinc and nucleation and growth of zinc oxide in the anode, thermodynamically consistent electrolyte transport in porous media, and multi-phase coexistance in the gas diffusion electrode. We perform electrochemical measurements and validate our model. Excellent agreement between theory and experiment is found and novel insights into the role of zinc oxide nucleation and growth and carbon dioxide dissolution for discharge and lifetime is presented. We demonstrate the implications of our work for the development of rechargeable zinc-air batteries.",Journal of Power Sources

Self-suspended polymer grafted nanoparticles,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdAddition of particulate fillers to polymers is a well-practiced method for augmenting properties of polymers. If at least one dimension of the filler is below 100 nm, large enhancements in properties are observed at particle concentrations well below the percolation threshold for micron sized fillers. For fundamental reasons, physical mixtures of nanoparticles and engineering polymers are rarely stable. This introduces as fundamental challenges in creating composites with reproducible structure and physical properties. Here we review recent progress in synthesis and in understanding of interactions, structure, and properties of a family of single-component nanocomposites created by densely grafting polymers of low and intermediate molecular weights to nanostructures. Under favorable conditions, these materials form self-suspended suspensions in which tethered polymers simultaneously provide steric barriers to aggregation and stretch to satisfy space-filling constraints, producing homogeneous materials. The review considers the role of interparticle forces in driving hyperuniform structure and in correlating dynamics of self-suspended materials.",Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering
Electrochemical characterization of P2-type layered Na2/3Ni1/4Mn3/4O2 cathode in aqueous hybrid sodium/lithium ion electrolyte,"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.P2-type layered Na2/3Ni1/4Mn3/4O2 has been synthesized by a solid-state method and its electrochemical behavior has been investigated as a potential cathode material in aqueous hybrid sodium/lithium ion electrolyte by adopting activated carbon as the counter electrode. The results indicate that the Na+/Li+ ratio in aqueous electrolyte has a strong influence on the capacity and cyclic stability of the Na2/3Ni1/4Mn3/4O2 electrode. Increase on the Li+ content leads to a shift of the redox potential towards a high value, which is favorable for the improvement of the working voltage of the layered material as cathode. It is found that the coexistence of Na+ and Li+ in aqueous electrolyte can improve the cyclic stability for the Na2/3Ni1/4Mn3/4O2 electrode. A reversible capacity of 54 mAh g−1 was obtained with a high cyclability as the Na+/Li+ ratio was 2:2. Furthermore, an aqueous hybrid ion cell was assembled with the as-proposed Na2/3Ni1/4Mn3/4O2 as cathode and NaTi2(PO4)3/graphite synthesized in this work as anode in 1 M Na2SO4/Li2SO4 (mole ratio as 2:2) mixed electrolyte. The cell shows an average discharge voltage at 1.2 V, delivering an energy density of 36 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 16 W kg−1 based on the total mass of the active materials.",Ceramics International
Theoretical investigations on the conversions of cyclic polysulfides to acyclic polysulfide diradicals and subsequent reactions of biological interest,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdSulfur is one of the most necessary biogenic elements in nature that must be assimilated by all organisms; it is an essential macronutrient for living organisms and has multiple roles in plant development. The oxidation of elemental sulfur is a complex process involving the contact of cells with sulfur particles, the oxidation of sulfur to sulfite, and the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate. To provide hypothesis concerning the most probable processes in the early states, we determined, by quantum-chemical calculations, the energies of some allotropic forms containing up to 32–40 sulfur atoms and energetics of their reactions with triplet dioxygen. The most probable reactions occurred with methylpolysulfane anions with an electron transfer to give the superoxide anion radical (and thiyls radicals) and especially the formation of peroxydic polysulfane anions. Calculations confirmed that the triplet diradical is more stable than the singlet one for acyclic polysulfide chains.",Tetrahedron

A hybrid polymer/oxide/ionic-liquid solid electrolyte for Na-metal batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The development of solid electrolytes with superior electrical and electrochemical performances for the room-temperature operation of sodium (Na)-based batteries is at the infant stage and still remains a challenge. Herein, we, for the first time, report hybrid solid electrolytes consisting of PEO20-NaClO4-5% SiO2-x% Emim FSI (x = 50, 70) designed for solid-state Na-metal batteries.

The finding implies that the hybrid solid electrolyte is promising for Na-metal batteries operating at room temperature.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Aluminium-ion batteries: developments and challenges,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.The concept of exploring the superior benefits of electropositive metals as anodes in rechargeable metal-batteries has resurfaced in recent times in anticipation of the future societal need for high energy density and affordable batteries. A rechargeable battery based on aluminium chemistry is envisioned to be a low cost energy storage platform, considering that aluminium is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust. The high volumetric capacity of aluminium, which is four and seven times larger than that of lithium and sodium respectively, unarguably has the potential to boost the energy density of aluminium-batteries on a per unit volume basis. Efforts to develop rechargeable aluminium-batteries can be traced to as early as the 1970s, however this area of research has seen a surge in activity since 2010, when the possibility of achieving an ambient temperature aluminium system was convincingly demonstrated. In recent times, rechargeable aluminium-batteries have been rechristened as aluminium-ion batteries. This review aims to comprehensively illustrate the developments regarding rechargeable non-aqueous aluminium-batteries or aluminium-ion batteries. Additionally, the challenges that impede progress in achieving a practical aluminium-ion battery are also discussed.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

Accordingly, future perspectives and opportunities are highlighted.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Pyrite FeS2 microspheres anchoring on reduced graphene oxide aerogel as an enhanced electrode material for sodium-ion batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Pyrite, FeS2, is a promising sodium battery electrode candidate owing to its abundance in natural resources; however, it suffers from poor cyclic performance and poor rate performance, which hinders its large-scale commercial application. The semiconductor nature of pyrite as well as the dissolution of polysulfide and the destruction of the morphology of pyrite during the charge/discharge process are the main reasons for the abovementioned two drawbacks. In this study, a well-designed FeS2/rGO-A composite was constructed using an ambient temperature reaction. The introduction of rGO-A improved the conductivity of the entire material without hindering sodium ion diffusion; it also confined the pulverized active material to prevent its loss. Additionally, by controlling the cutoff voltage above 0.8 V, the formation of polysulfide was avoided. As a result, the FeS2/rGO-A electrode displays both excellent cyclic performance (low decay rate of 0.051% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1C) and rate performance (more than 70% discharge capacity is retained at 5C compared to 0.1C). The unique electrochemical mechanism was also investigated in detail. A new perspective of pyrite electrochemical behavior was obtained. This study provides not only a theoretical basis for further study, but may also enable the large-scale commercial application of sodium-ion batteries.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

All-solid-state Na-ion rechargeable batteries utilizing non-flammable ceramic Na superionic conductor electrolytes are a promising alternative. Among the known sodium conducting electrolytes the cubic Na3PS4 phase has relatively high sodium ion conductivity exceeding 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. Here we systematically study the doping of Na3PS4 with Ge4+, Ti4+, Sn4+ and optimise the processing of these phases. A maximum ionic conductivity of 2.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 is achieved for Na3.1Sn0.1P0.9S4. Utilising this fast Na+ ion conductor, a new class of all-solid-state Na2+2δFe2−δ(SO4)3|Na3+xMxP1−xS4 (M = Ge4+, Ti4+, Sn4+) (x = 0, 0.1)|Na2Ti3O7 sodium-ion secondary batteries is demonstrated that is based on earth-abundant safe materials and features high rate capability even at room temperature.

At low rates the initial capacity matches the theoretical capacity of ca. 113 mA h g−1. At 2C rate the first discharge capacity at room temperature is still 83 mA h per gram of Na2+2δFe2−δ(SO4)3 and at 80 °C it rises to 109 mA h per gram with 80% capacity retention over 100 cycles.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Electrolyte-controlled discharge product distribution of Na-O2 batteries: A combined computational and experimental study,"© the Owner Societies 2017.Tuning the composition of discharge products is an important strategy to reduce charge potential, suppress side reactions, and improve the reversibility of metal-oxygen batteries. In the present study, first-principles calculations and experimental confirmation were performed to unravel the influence of O2 pressure, particle size, and electrolyte on the composition of charge products in Na-O2 batteries. The electrolytes with medium and high donor numbers (>12.5) are favorable for the formation of sole NaO2, while those with low donor numbers (<12.5) may permit the formation of Na2O2 by disproportionation reactions. Our comparative experiments under different electrolytes confirmed the calculation prediction. Our calculations indicated that O2 pressure and particle size hardly affect discharge products. On the electrode, only one-electron-transfer electrochemical reaction to form NaO2 takes place, whereas two-electron-transfer electrochemical and chemical reactions to form Na2O2 and Na3O4 are prevented in thermodynamics. The present study explains why metastable NaO2 was identified as a sole discharge product in many experiments, while thermodynamically more stable Na2O2 was not observed. Therefore, to achieve low overpotential, a high-donor-number electrolyte should be applied in the discharge processes of Na-O2 batteries.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics
Exceptional energy and new insight with a sodium-selenium battery based on a carbon nanosheet cathode and a pseudographite anode,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.We created a unique sodium ion battery (NIB, SIB) cathode based on selenium in cellulose-derived carbon nanosheets (CCNs), termed Se-CCN. The elastically compliant two-dimensional CCN host incorporates a high mass loading of amorphous Se (53 wt%), which is primarily impregnated into 1 cm3 g-1 nanopores. The results in facile sodiation kinetics due to short solid-state diffusion distances and a large charge transfer area of the nanosheets were established. The architecture also leads to an intrinsic resistance to polyselenide shuttle and to disintegration/coarsening. As a Na half-cell, the Se-CCN cathode delivers a reversible capacity of 613 mA h g-1 with 88% retention over 500 cycles. The exceptional stability is achieved by using a standard electrolyte (1 M NaClO4 EC-DMC) without secondary additives or high salt concentrations. The rate capability is also superb, achieving 300 mA h g-1 at 10C. Compared to recent state-of-the-art literature, the Se-CCN is the most cyclically stable and offers the highest rate performance. As a Se-Na battery, the system achieves 992 W h kg-1 at 68 W kg-1 and 384 W h kg-1 at 10 144 W kg-1 (by active mass in a cathode). We are the first to fabricate and test a Se-based full NIB, which is based on Se-CCN coupled to a Na intercalating pseudographitic carbon (PGC) anode. It is demonstrated that the PGC anode increases its structural order in addition to dilating as a result of Na intercalation at voltages below 0.2 V vs. Na/Na+. The {110} Na reflections are distinctly absent from the XRD patterns of PGC sodiated down to 0.001 V, indicating that the Na metal pore filling is not significant for pseudographitic carbons. The battery delivers highly promising Ragone chart characteristics, for example yielding 203 and 50 W h kg-1 at 70 and 14 000 W kg-1 (via total material mass in the anode and cathode).",Energy and Environmental Science

Kinetics of Na|CFx and Li|CFx systems,"© 2016, The Author(s).Properties of CFx/Li and CFx/Na cells were examined while using galvanostatic charging/discharging, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The capacity during the first cycle was as high as ca. 1000 mAh g−1. Such an electrode is suitable for primary CFx/Li and CFx/Na batteries. SEM images of CFx cathode showed that during discharging it was transformed into amorphous carbon and LiF or NaF crystals (of diameter of ca. 5–20 μm). These systems (C + LiF or C + NaF) cannot be reversibly converted back into CFx/Li or CFx/Na, respectively. Exchange current densities are between 10−7 Acm−2 and 10−9 Acm−2 when working with LiPF6 and NaPF6 electrolytes (1.12 × 10−7 Acm−2 and 6.82 × 10−9 Acm−2, respectively). Those values are low and indicate that the charge transfer process may be the rate-determining step. Activation energies for the charge transfer process were 57 and 72 kJ mol−1 for CFx/LiPF6 and CFx/NaPF6 systems, respectively. Higher activation energy barrier for the CF/Na+ + e− → C + NaF reaction results in lower observed exchange current density in comparison to the system with lithium ions.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry

Bivalence Mn 5 O 8 with hydroxylated interphase for high-voltage aqueous sodium-ion storage,"© The Author(s) 2016.Aqueous electrochemical energy storage devices have attracted significant attention owing to their high safety, low cost and environmental friendliness.

Here we report the formation of layered Mn 5 O 8 pseudocapacitor electrode material with a well-ordered hydroxylated interphase. A symmetric full cell using such electrodes demonstrates a stable potential window of 3.0 V in an aqueous electrolyte, as well as high energy and power performance, nearly 100% coulombic efficiency and 85% energy efficiency after 25,000 charge-discharge cycles. The interplay between hydroxylated interphase on the surface and the unique bivalence structure of Mn 5 O 8 suppresses the gas evolution reactions, offers a two-electron charge transfer via Mn 2+ /Mn 4+ redox couple, and provides facile pathway for Na-ion transport via intra-/inter-layer defects of Mn 5 O 8.",Nature Communications
Multistep Reaction Mechanisms in Nonaqueous Lithium-Oxygen Batteries with Redox Mediator: A Model-Based Study,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Lithium-oxygen cells with nonaqueous electrolyte show high overpotentials during charge, indicating asymmetric charge/discharge reaction mechanisms. We present a kinetic modeling and simulation study of the lithium-oxygen cell cycling behavior. The model includes a multistep reaction mechanism of the cell reaction (2Li + O2 ⇄ Li2O2) forming lithium peroxide by precipitation, coupled to a 1D porous-electrode transport model. We apply the model to study the asymmetric discharge/charge characteristics and analyze the influence of a redox mediator dissolved homogeneously in the liquid electrolyte. Model predictions are compared to experimental galvanostatic cycling data of cells without and with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) as redox mediator. The predicted discharge behavior shows good agreement with the experimental results. A spatiotemporal analysis of species concentrations reveals inhomogeneous distributions of dissolved oxygen and reaction products within the cathode during discharge. The experimentally observed charge overpotentials as well as their reduction by using a redox mediator can be qualitatively reproduced with a partially irreversible reaction mechanism. However, the proposed models fail to reproduce the particular shape of the experimental charge curve with continuously increasing charge overpotential, which implies that part of the reaction mechanism is still open for investigation in future work.

Sodium Bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide/Poly(ethylene oxide) Polymer Electrolytes for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSodium-ion batteries (SIBs), a promising substitute for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), are considered to have the potential to be employed in large-scale energy storage systems with lower cost and enhanced safety as primary concerns. Solid polymer electrolyte (SPE)-based SIBs will more likely meet these demands, because of their good flame resistance and excellent flexibility compared with conventional organic liquid-electrolyte-based SIBs. Here, we describe an SPE composed of sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). The NaFSI/PEO (molar ratio of EO/Na+=20) blended polymer electrolyte exhibits a low glass transition temperature (i.e. −37.9 °C), relatively high ionic conductivity (i.e. ≈4.1×10−4 S cm−1 at 80 °C), and enough electrochemical and thermal stability for application in SIBs. Most importantly, the NaFSI/PEO blended polymer electrolyte displays excellent interfacial stability with Na metal in Na/Na cells and good cycling performance in prototype cells with Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 as the cathode material. All of these properties make NaFSI-based SPEs promising candidates for use in SIBs.",ChemElectroChem
Energy storage in the energy transition context: A technology review,"© 2016 Elsevier LtdConcerns about climate change as well as fossil fuel usage restrictions motivate the energy transition to a sustainable energy sector requiring very high penetration level of renewable energy sources in the World energy matrix, including those heavily hydrocarbon-based as fuel for transportation. Some of these renewable sources have an uncontrollable output and managing the variability is challenging. The current upward trend in renewables participation will demand even more flexibility from the energy systems. Among several options for increasing flexibility, energy storage (ES) is a promising one considering the variability of many renewable sources. The purpose of this study is to present a comprehensive updated review of ES technologies, briefly address their applications and discuss the barriers to ES deployment. Methodology involves the description and the analysis of ES many existing and developing technologies. ES applications are discussed briefly using logistic and parametric classification logics. As result of this study, it will be pointed out that no ES technology outstands simultaneously in all technical characteristics and consequently, selection should be driven on a case base analysis. Economic feasibility of ES business models and establishment of a well-suited regulatory environment are major issues to unlock ES deployment. Regarding energy transition, Power-to-Gas, Power-to-Liquids and Solar-to-Fuel technologies are very promising and further studies about these technologies are required to better understand their possibilities and how to overcome the barriers to their practical usage.",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
Designing high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Due to their high energy density and low material cost, lithium-sulfur batteries represent a promising energy storage system for a multitude of emerging applications, ranging from stationary grid storage to mobile electric vehicles. This review aims to summarize major developments in the field of lithium-sulfur batteries, starting from an overview of their electrochemistry, technical challenges and potential solutions, along with some theoretical calculation results to advance our understanding of the material interactions involved. Next, we examine the most extensively-used design strategy: encapsulation of sulfur cathodes in carbon host materials. Other emerging host materials, such as polymeric and inorganic materials, are discussed as well. This is followed by a survey of novel battery configurations, including the use of lithium sulfide cathodes and lithium polysulfide catholytes, as well as recent burgeoning efforts in the modification of separators and protection of lithium metal anodes. Finally, we conclude with an outlook section to offer some insight on the future directions and prospects of lithium-sulfur batteries.",Chemical Society Reviews
Dissociation and Diffusion of Glyme-Sodium Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide Complexes in Hydrofluoroether-Based Electrolytes for Sodium Batteries,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Physicochemical properties and battery performance of [Na(glyme)][TFSA] complexes (TFSA: bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide) dissolved in a hydrofluoroether (HFE) were investigated. Glyme (tetraglyme (G4) or pentaglyme (G5)) coordinates to Na+ to form a 1:1 complex [Na(G4 or G5)]+ cation. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the complex structure of [Na(glyme)]+ is maintained in the HFE solution, and free (uncoordinated) glymes are not liberated on adding HFE. HFE molecules are scarcely involved in the first solvation shell of Na+ because of their low electron-pair-donating ability. Raman spectra of the [TFSA]- anion suggests that the attractive interaction between the complex [Na(glyme)]+ cation and [TFSA]- anion is enhanced on adding HFE. The population of contact ion-pair (CIP) and/or aggregate (AGG) is smaller for the G5 system than for the G4 one, and the [Na(G5)][TFSA]/HFE has higher ionic conductivity. The self-diffusion coefficients of the [Na(glyme)]+ complex and [TFSA]- were measured by pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR, and the dissociativity of [Na(glyme)][TFSA] was assessed. The dissociativity of the G5 system is greater than that of the G4 one, and the dissociativity can be correlated with the attractive interaction between [Na(glyme)]+ and [TFSA]-, as evaluated by ab initio calculations. The dissociativity of the complexes gave significant effects on the battery performance.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Interfacial Reactivity Benchmarking of the Sodium Ion Conductors Na3PS4 and Sodium β-Alumina for Protected Sodium Metal Anodes and Sodium All-Solid-State Batteries,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.The interfacial stability of solid electrolytes at the electrodes is crucial for an application of all-solid-state batteries and protected electrodes. For instance, undesired reactions between sodium metal electrodes and the solid electrolyte form charge transfer hindering interphases. Due to the resulting large interfacial resistance, the charge transfer kinetics are altered and the overvoltage increases, making the interfacial stability of electrolytes the limiting factor in these systems. Driven by the promising ionic conductivities of Na3PS4, here we explore the stability and viability of Na3PS4 as a solid electrolyte against metallic Na and compare it to that of Na-β″-Al2O3 (sodium β-alumina). As expected, Na-β″-Al2O3 is stable against sodium, whereas Na3PS4 decomposes with an increasing overall resistance, making Na-β″-Al2O3 the electrolyte of choice for protected sodium anodes and all-solid-state batteries.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Sodium Ion Diffusion in Nasicon (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) Solid Electrolytes: Effects of Excess Sodium,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.The Na superionic conductor (aka Nasicon, Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 3) is one of the promising solid electrolyte materials used in advanced molten Na-based secondary batteries that typically operate at high temperature (over ∼270 °C). Nasicon provides a 3D diffusion network allowing the transport of the active Na-ion species (i.e., ionic conductor) while blocking the conduction of electrons (i.e., electronic insulator) between the anode and cathode compartments of cells. In this work, the standard Nasicon (Na3Zr2Si2PO12, bare sample) and 10 at% Na-excess Nasicon (Na3.3Zr2Si2PO12, Na-excess sample) solid electrolytes were synthesized using a solid-state sintering technique to elucidate the Na diffusion mechanism (i.e., grain diffusion or grain boundary diffusion) and the impacts of adding excess Na at relatively low and high temperatures. The structural, thermal, and ionic transport characterizations were conducted using various experimental tools including X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In addition, an ab initio atomistic modeling study was carried out to computationally examine the detailed microstructures of Nasicon materials, as well as to support the experimental observations. Through this combination work comprising experimental and computational investigations, we show that the predominant mechanisms of Na-ion transport in the Nasicon structure are the grain boundary and the grain diffusion at low and high temperatures, respectively. Also, it was found that adding 10 at% excess Na could give rise to a substantial increase in the total conductivity (e.g., ∼1.2 × 10-1 S/cm at 300 °C) of Nasicon electrolytes resulting from the enlargement of the bottleneck areas in the Na diffusion channels of polycrystalline grains.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Covalent sulfur for advanced room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2016 Elsevier LtdThe room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries have attracted extensive attention due to its low cost and high specific energy. Yet, RT Na-S batteries usually suffer from low reversible capacity, short lifespan and inferior Coulombic efficiency. Herein, covalent sulfur based carbonaceous materials was investigated for RT Na-S battery to address these drawbacks. Generally, the covalent S could prevent the formation of sodium polysulfide (Na2Sn, 4≤n≤8) effectively, further avoid the dissolution of sodium polysulfide into electrolyte; besides, the covalent S in these carbonaceous materials is reversible during charge/discharge process, which is good for cycling stability. Benefiting from these merits, the covalent sulfur based materials delivers high reversible capacity over 1000 mA h g−1, long cycling stability for 900 cycles with capacity decay of 0.053% per cycle and superior Coulombic efficiency approximately 100%. This study may provide a new method for designing high performance RT Na-S batteries.",Nano Energy
Stabilizing nickel sulfide nanoparticles with an ultrathin carbon layer for improved cycling performance in sodium ion batteries,"© 2016, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Nanostructured metal sulfides are potential electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries; however, they typically suffer from very poor cycling stability due to large volume changes and dissolution of discharge products. Herein we propose a rational material design strategy for sulfide-based materials to address these problems. Taking nickel sulfide (NiSx) as an example, we demonstrated that its electrochemical performance can be dramatically improved by confining the NiSx nanoparticles in a percolating conductive carbon nanotube network, and stabilizing them with an ultrathin carbon coating layer. The carbon layer serves as a physical barrier to alleviate the effects of both the volume change and dissolution of active materials. The hybrid material exhibited a large reversible specific capacity of >500 mAh/g and excellent cycling stability over 200 cycles. Given the traditionally problematic nature of NiSx as a battery anode material, we believe that the observed high performance reported here reflects the effectiveness of our material design strategy.

Electrospun carbon-based nanostructured electrodes for advanced energy storage - A review,"© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.One-dimensional (1D) carbon-based composite nanostructures have been considered promising electrodes for advanced electrical energy storage systems, e.g., rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors, because of their high conductivity, good mechanical integrity, and large surface area. Electrospinning is a simple, low cost, and scalable technology to synthesize 1D carbon-based nanocomposites with tailored nanostructures and compositions. These electrospun carbonaceous nanomaterials not only can be directly used as electrodes but also as substrates with the benefits of supporting active materials such as metal, metal oxide and sulfur, improving structural stability upon cycling, and enhancing the conductivity of the electrodes. Herein, we first give a simple description on the configuration and mechanism of these energy storage devices. We then summarize the electrospinning parameters, the distribution of different components in the solution before and after electrospinning (e.g., polymer A in matrix polymer B and nanoparticle in matrix polymer), and post-electrospinning treatments (i.e., calcination, activation and hydrothermal process) on the influences of structural, compositional and morphological features of resulting electrospun nanocomposites. Discussions on how to design and synthesize the desired compositions and nanostructured architectures (e.g., core/shell, hollow tubular, porous and hierarchical structures) with unique physical/chemical properties (e.g., surface area, pore volume and conductivity) are presented. Current developments of electrospun carbon-based hybrids for emerging applications in Li/Na-ion batteries, Li/Na-S batteries and supercapacitors are reviewed. The relationships between electrospinning process parameters, post-electrospinning treatments, nanostructures and electrochemical properties are sought. Finally, concluding remarks and outlook on current challenges and future research directions of these 1D carbon-based hybrid electrodes are given.",Energy Storage Materials
Ionic liquid-based sodium ion-conducting composite gel polymer electrolytes: effect of active and passive fillers,"© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.We report the studies on composite gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) comprising 0.5 M solution of sodium trifluoromethane sulfonate (Na-triflate or NaTf) in ionic liquid 1-ethyl 3-methyl imidazolium trifluoromethane sulfonate (EMITf) entrapped in poly (vinylidinefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) dispersed with passive filler Al2O3 and active filler NaAlO2 particles. The free-standing films of the composite GPEs, prepared from solution-cast method, offer optimum ionic conductivity at room temperature (6.3–6.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 5.5–6.5 × 10−3 S cm−1 for Al2O3- and NaAlO2-dispersed GPEs, respectively), with sufficient electrochemical stability and excellent thermal stability up to 340 °C. As observed from XRD and SEM, the composites are of predominantly amorphous and porous character, which support the high ionic conduction. The sodium ion transport number has been found to be ∼0.27 for Al2O3-dispersed GPE and 0.42 for NaAlO2-dispersed GPE, which indicates the predominant role of passive and active fillers, Al2O3 and NaAlO2, respectively. The dispersion of NaAlO2 enhances the sodium ion conductivity in composite GPE substantially. The overall ionic conductivity is same as in the case of Al2O3 dispersion. The performance characteristics of GPE, particularly, dispersed with active filler NaAlO2 show its potential applicability as electrolyte/separator in sodium batteries.",Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry
A flexible S1-xSex@porous carbon nanofibers (x≤0.1) thin film with high performance for Li-S batteries and room-temperature Na-S batteries,"© 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.The insulating nature of sulfur and the dissolution of the reaction intermediates of polysulfides are still main challenges in rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) and room temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries, both of which cause severe capacity loss and low Columbic efficiency during cycling. In this work, by rationally design, we fabricated a flexible electrode by impregnation S1-xSex (x≤0.1) into porous carbon nanofibers (denoted as S1-xSex@PCNFs) for flexible Li-S batteries and RT Na-S batteries. The free-standing porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) film not only allows facile access of ion but also enhances the electronic conductivity of electrode and high mechanical flexibility. In addition, the micropores in PCNFs promise a sufficient S1-xSex loading and a high utilization of the active material. Furthermore, the introduction of Se in S could not only enhance the poor electronic conductivity of S but also form S-Se bonding that inhibits the shuttle phenomena of polysulfides. Such a flexible S1-xSex@PCNFs (x=0.04) electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance for both Li-S (840 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1) and Na-S batteries (762 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1), demonstrating that the diffusion of the polysulfides into the electrolyte can be greatly alleviated.",Energy Storage Materials
Electrochemistry of Selenium with Sodium and Lithium: Kinetics and Reaction Mechanism,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.There are economic and environmental advantages by replacing Li with Na in energy storage. However, sluggishness in the charge/discharge reaction and low capacity are among the major obstacles to development of high-power sodium-ion batteries. Among the electrode materials recently developed for sodium-ion batteries, selenium shows considerable promise because of its high capacity and good cycling ability. Herein, we have investigated the mechanism and kinetics of both sodiation and lithiation reactions with selenium nanotubes, using in situ transmission electron microscopy. Sodiation of a selenium nanotube exhibits a three-step reaction mechanism: (1) the selenium single crystal transforms into an amorphous phase Na0.5Se; (2) the Na0.5Se amorphous phase crystallizes to form a polycrystalline Na2Se2 phase; and (3) Na2Se2 transforms into the Na2Se phase. Under similar conditions, the lithiation of Se exhibits a one-step reaction mechanism, with phase transformation from single-crystalline Se to a Li2Se. Intriguingly, sodiation kinetics is generally about 4-5 times faster than that of lithiation, and the kinetics during the different stages of sodiation is different. Na-based intermediate phases are found to have improved electronic and ionic conductivity compared to those of Li compounds by first-principles density functional theory calculations.",ACS Nano
Electric double-layer capacitors with tea waste derived activated carbon electrodes and plastic crystal based flexible gel polymer electrolytes,"We report a novel configuration of symmetrical electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) comprising a plastic crystalline succinonitrile (SN) based flexible polymer gel electrolyte, incorporated with sodium trifluoromethane sulfonate (NaTf) immobilised in a host polymer poly (vinylidine fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP). The cost-effective activated carbon powder possessing a specific surface area (SSA) of ∼ 1700 m2g-1 containing a large proportion of meso-porosity has been derived from tea waste to use as supercapacitor electrodes. The high ionic conductivity (∼3.6×10-3 S cm-1 at room temperature) and good electrochemical stability render the gel polymer electrolyte film a suitable candidate for the fabrication of EDLCs. The performance of the EDLCs has been tested by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies. The performance of the EDLC cell is found to be promising in terms of high values of specific capacitance (∼270 F g-1), specific energy (∼ 36 Wh kg-1), and power density (∼ 33 kW kg-1).",Journal of Physics: Conference Series
CuO Quantum Dots Embedded in Carbon Nanofibers as Binder-Free Anode for Sodium Ion Batteries with Enhanced Properties,"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe design of sodium ion batteries is proposed based on the use of flexible membrane composed of ultrasmall transition metal oxides. In this paper, the preparation of CuO quantum dots (≈2 nm) delicately embedded in carbon nanofibers (denoted as 2-CuO@C) with a thin film via a feasible electrospinning method is reported. The CuO content can be controlled by altering the synthetic conditions and is optimized to 54 wt%. As binder-free anode for sodium ion batteries, 2-CuO@C delivers an initial reversible capacity of 528 mA h g−1 at the current density of 100 mA g−1, an exceptional rate capability of 250 mA h g−1 at 5000 mA g−1, and an ultra-stable capacity of 401 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 500 mA g−1. The enhancement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique structure of 2-CuO@C, which offers a variety of advantages: highly conductive carbon matrix suppressing agglomeration of CuO grains, interconnected nanofibers ensuring short transport length for electrons, well-dispersed CuO quantum dots leading to highly utilization rate, and good mechanical properties resulting in strong electrode integrity.",Small
A Sodium-Ion Battery with a Low-Cost Cross-Linked Gel-Polymer Electrolyte,"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe design of a sodium-ion rechargeable battery with an antimony anode, a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, and a low-cost composite gel-polymer electrolyte based on cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate) is reported. The application of an antimony anode, on replacement of the sodium metal that is commonly used in sodium-ion half-cells, reduces significantly the interfacial resistance and charge transfer resistance of a sodium-ion battery, which enables a smaller polarization for a sodium-ion full-cell Sb/Na3V2(PO4)3 running at relatively high charge and discharge rates. The incorporation of the gel-polymer electrolyte is beneficial to maintain stable interfaces between the electrolyte and the electrodes of the sodium-ion battery at elevated temperature. When running at 60 °C, the sodium-ion full-cell Sb/Na3V2(PO4)3 with the gel-polymer electrolyte exhibits superior cycling stability compared to a battery with the conventional liquid electrolyte.",Advanced Energy Materials
High capacity Na-O2 batteries: Key parameters for solution-mediated discharge,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.The Na-O2 battery offers an interesting alternative to the Li-O2 battery, which is still the source of a number of unsolved scientific questions. In spite of both being alkali metal-O2 batteries, they display significant differences. For instance, Li-O2 batteries form Li2O2 as the discharge product at the cathode, whereas Na-O2 batteries usually form NaO2. A very important question that affects the performance of the Na-O2 cell concerns the key parameters governing the growth mechanism of the large NaO2 cubes formed upon reduction, which are a requirement of viable capacities and high performance. By comparing glyme-ethers of various chain lengths, we show that the choice of solvent has a tremendous effect on the battery performance. In contrast to the Li-O2 system, high solubilities of the NaO2 discharge product do not necessarily lead to increased capacities. Herein we report the profound effect of the Na+ ion solvent shell structure on the NaO2 growth mechanism. Strong solvent-solute interactions in long-chain ethers shift the formation of NaO2 toward a surface process resulting in submicrometric crystallites and very low capacities (ca. 0.2 mAh/cm2(geom)). In contrast, short chains, which facilitate desolvation and solution-precipitation, promote the formation of large cubic crystals (ca. 10 um), enabling high capacities (ca. 7.5 mAh/cm2(geom)). This work provides a new way to look at the key role that solvents play in the metal-air system.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Vanadium dioxide – Reduced graphene oxide composite as cathode materials for rechargeable Li and Na batteries,"© 2016 Elsevier B.V.In this study, a metastable form of vanadium dioxide, denoted as VO2(B), has been successfully synthesized under solvothermal condition. However, the as-received VO2(B) suffers from fast capacity fading and poor high-rate performance. In order to overcome these problems, the as-received VO2(B) is solvothermally treated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to produce VO2(B)/rGO composite. As a result, the resulting electric conductivity of the VO2(B)/rGO composite is improved to ∼10−4 cm S−1 (from ∼10−7 S cm−1 for the as-received VO2(B)). Electrochemical data of the VO2(B)/rGO composite, tested in both Li and Na cells, shows markedly enhanced electrochemical performance compared to bare VO2(B). The effect of electro-conducting rGO is more evident at high rates.",Journal of Power Sources
In Situ Monitoring of Fast Li-Ion Conductor Li7P3S11 Crystallization Inside a Hot-Press Setup,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Rechargeable solid-state lithium ion batteries (SSLB) require fast ion conducting solid electrolytes (SEs) to enable high charge and discharge rates. Li7P3S11 is a particularly promising lithium solid electrolyte, exhibiting very high room temperature conductivities of up to 17 mS·cm-1 and high ductility, allowing fast ion transport through the bulk and intimate contact to high surface electrodes. Here we present a novel hot-press setup that facilitates the synthesis of solid electrolytes by combining in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with simultaneous temperature- and pressure-monitoring. While a high room temperature conductivity in the order of 10 mS·cm-1 is readily achieved for phase pure Li7P3S11 with this design, it further enables monitoring of the different steps of crystallization from an amorphous Li2S-P2S5 glass to triclinic Li7P3S11. Nucleation, crystallization and - at temperatures exceeding 280 °C - decomposition of the material are analyzed in real time, enabling process optimization. The results are supported ex situ by means of X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Proof-of-principle experiments show the promising cycling- and rate capability of Li0.3In0.7/Li7P3S11/S-composite all-solid-state batteries. It is furthermore presented that discharging below a limit of 1.2 V results in decomposition of the SE/cathode interface.",Chemistry of Materials

All rights reserved.NaTi2(PO4)3/C porous plates have been successfully synthesized via solvothermal approach with ammonia as inductive agent combined in-situ carbon coating. It reveals that the inductive agent plays a critical role in morphology-controllable fabrication. The morphology, structure, and electrochemical properties of NaTi2(PO4)3/C composites with multilayered plates, single-layered plate, porous multilayered plates all have been investigated, which are prepared by using urea, triethylamine, and ammonia, respectively. Among these samples, NaTi2(PO4)3/C porous multilayered plates with ammonia addition exhibit the best electrochemical properties due to their unique mesoporous structure. NaTi2(PO4)3/C porous multilayered plates deliver an initial specific capacity of 125 and 110 mAh g-1 at 0.1 and 1 C, respectively. Furthermore, NaTi2(PO4)3/C porous multilayered plates show a good rate capability, whose capacity and corresponding capacity retention reach 85 mAh g-1 and 82.4%, respectively, after 120 cycles under the high rate of 10 C. The excellent results indicate that the NaTi2(PO4)3/C porous multilayered plates are a promising electrode candidate for sodium ion battery.",Journal of Power Sources
Conductive Carbon Network inside a Sulfur-Impregnated Carbon Sponge: A Bioinspired High-Performance Cathode for Li-S Battery,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.A highly conductive sulfur cathode is crucial for improving the kinetic performance of a Li-S battery. The encapsulation of sulfur in porous nanocarbons is expected to benefit the Li+ migration, yet the e- conduction is still to be improved due to a low graphitization degree of a conventional carbon substrate, especially that pyrolyzed from carbohydrates or polymers. Aiming at facilitating the e- conduction in the cathode, here we propose to use ketjen black, a highly graphitized nanocarbon building block to form a conductive network for electrons in a biomass-derived, hierarchically porous carbon sponge by a easily scaled-up approach at a low cost. The specifically designed carbon host ensures a high loading and good retention of active sulfur, while also provides a faster electron transmission to benefit the lithiation/delithiation kinetics of sulfur. The sulfur cathode prepared from the carbon network shows excellent cycling and rate performance in a Li-S battery, rendering its practicality for emerging energy storage opportunities such as grids or automobiles.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
A thermo-mechanical stress prediction model for contemporary planar sodium sulfur (NaS) cells,"© 2016 Elsevier B.V.We introduce a comprehensive finite-element analysis (FEA) computational model to accurately predict the thermo-mechanical stresses at heterogeneous joints and components of large-size sodium sulfur (NaS) cells during thermal cycling. Quantification of the thermo-mechanical stress is important because the accumulation of stress during cell assembly and/or operation is one of the critical issues in developing practical planar NaS cells. The computational model is developed based on relevant experimental assembly and operation conditions to predict the detailed stress field of a state-of-the-art planar NaS cell. Prior to the freeze-and-thaw thermal cycle simulation, residual stresses generated from the actual high temperature cell assembly procedures are calculated and implemented into the subsequent model. The calculation results show that large stresses are developed on the outer surface of the insulating header and the solid electrolyte, where component fracture is frequently observed in the experimental cell fabrication process. The impacts of the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of glass materials and the thicknesses of cell container on the stress accumulation are also evaluated to improve the cell manufacturing procedure and to guide the material choices for enhanced thermo-mechanical stability of large-size NaS cells.",Journal of Power Sources
A Na+ Superionic Conductor for Room-Temperature Sodium Batteries,"© 2016 The Author(s).Rechargeable lithium ion batteries have ruled the consumer electronics market for the past 20 years and have great significance in the growing number of electric vehicles and stationary energy storage applications. However, in addition to concerns about electrochemical performance, the limited availability of lithium is gradually becoming an important issue for further continued use and development of lithium ion batteries. Therefore, a significant shift in attention has been taking place towards new types of rechargeable batteries such as sodium-based systems that have low cost. Another important aspect of sodium battery is its potential compatibility with the all-solid-state design where solid electrolyte is used to replace liquid one, leading to simple battery design, long life span, and excellent safety. The key to the success of all-solid-state battery design is the challenge of finding solid electrolytes possessing acceptable high ionic conductivities at room temperature. Herein, we report a novel sodium superionic conductor with NASICON structure, Na3.1Zr1.95Mg0.05Si2PO12 that shows high room-temperature ionic conductivity of 3.5 × 10-3S cm-1. We also report successful fabrication of a room-temperature solid-state Na-S cell using this conductor.",Scientific Reports
Towards safer sodium-ion batteries via organic solvent/ionic liquid based hybrid electrolytes,"© 2016 Elsevier B.V.Hybrid electrolytes aimed at application in sodium-ion batteries (SIB) consisting of an organic solvent mixture (EC:PC) and different ionic liquids (ILs); EMImTFSI, BMImTFSI, and Pyr13TFSI, and with the NaTFSI salt providing the Na+ charge carriers have here been extensively studied. The physico-chemical and electrochemical characterisation includes ionic conductivity, viscosity, density, cation coordination and solvation, various safety measures, and electrochemical stability window (ESW). Hybrid electrolytes with 10-50% of IL content were found to have ionic conductivities on par with comparable organic solvent based electrolytes, but with highly enhanced safety properties. A systematic Raman spectroscopy study of the cation coordination and solvation before and after electrolyte safety tests by ignition suggest that IL cations and TFSI remain stable when ignited while organic solvents are consumed. Finally, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed when using hybrid electrolytes has both better mechanical and electrochemical stability than the SEI derived from pure IL based electrolytes. For a half-cell with a hard carbon (HC) electrode and a hybrid electrolyte with a composition of 0.8 m NaTFSI in EC0.45:PC0.45:Pyr13TFSI0.10 encouraging results were obtained for IL based electrolytes - ca. 182 mAhg-1 at C/10 over 40 cycles.",Journal of Power Sources
Amorphous Li2O2: Chemical Synthesis and Electrochemical Properties,"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimWhen aprotic Li–O2batteries discharge, the product phase formed in the cathode often contains two different morphologies, that is, crystalline and amorphous Li2O2. The morphology of Li2O2impacts strongly on the electrochemical performance of Li–O2cells in terms of energy efficiency and rate capability. Crystalline Li2O2is readily available and its properties have been studied in depth for Li–O2batteries. However, little is known about the amorphous Li2O2because of its rarity in high purity. Herein, amorphous Li2O2has been synthesized by a rapid reaction of tetramethylammonium superoxide and LiClO4in solution, and its amorphous nature has been confirmed by a range of techniques. Compared with its crystalline siblings, amorphous Li2O2demonstrates enhanced charge-transport properties and increased electro-oxidation kinetics, manifesting itself a desirable discharge phase for high-performance Li–O2batteries.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Graphene-Based Nanocomposites for Energy Storage,"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSince the first report of using micromechanical cleavage method to produce graphene sheets in 2004, graphene/graphene-based nanocomposites have attracted wide attention both for fundamental aspects as well as applications in advanced energy storage and conversion systems. In comparison to other materials, graphene-based nanostructured materials have unique 2D structure, high electronic mobility, exceptional electronic and thermal conductivities, excellent optical transmittance, good mechanical strength, and ultrahigh surface area.

Solvation Structure and Concentration in Glyme-Based Sodium Electrolytes: A Combined Spectroscopic and Computational Study,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.The optimal salt concentration used in metal-ion energy storage devices has long focused heavily on 1 M electrolytes; however, recent evidence suggests taking a deeper look at electrolyte properties as a function of salt concentration. Toward that goal, the effect of concentration on solvation properties for a prototype sodium electrolyte is considered with potential applications for sodium-ion and sodium-air technologies. An empirical force field for sodium triflate in digylme, an electrolyte already in use with sodium-air systems, was developed from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the variational force-matching method. Atomistic simulations of this electrolyte along with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) experimental studies validate the qualitative accuracy of the model and demonstrate its transferability across different concentrations. The solvation structure and the extent of ion pairing effects in the electrolyte were considered for concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2.0 M in the sodium salt. Ion pairing effects are seen even at dilute concentrations of 0.5 M in both simulations and experiments, with a transition from solvent-separated species to direct contact ion pairs as the concentration increased to 1.5 M. With further increase in the concentration, evidence for ion aggregation is also presented.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
A Rechargeable Al/S Battery with an Ionic-Liquid Electrolyte,"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAluminum metal is a promising anode material for next generation rechargeable batteries owing to its abundance, potentially dendrite-free deposition, and high capacity. The rechargeable aluminum/sulfur (Al/S) battery is of great interest owing to its high energy density (1340 Wh kg−1) and low cost. However, Al/S chemistry suffers poor reversibility owing to the difficulty of oxidizing AlSx. Herein, we demonstrate the first reversible Al/S battery in ionic-liquid electrolyte with an activated carbon cloth/sulfur composite cathode. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic results suggest that sulfur undergoes a solid-state conversion reaction in the electrolyte. Kinetics analysis identifies that the slow solid-state sulfur conversion reaction causes large voltage hysteresis and limits the energy efficiency of the system.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition

New Insights into the Instability of Discharge Products in Na-O2 Batteries,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Sodium-oxygen batteries currently stimulate extensive research due to their high theoretical energy density and improved operational stability when compared to lithium-oxygen batteries. Cell stability, however, needs to be demonstrated also under resting conditions before future implementation of these batteries. In this work we analyze the effect of resting periods on the stability of the sodium superoxide (NaO2) discharge product. The instability of NaO2 in the cell environment is demonstrated leading to the evolution of oxygen during the resting period and the decrease of the cell efficiency. In addition, migration of the superoxide anion (O2-) in the electrolyte is observed and demonstrated to be an important factor affecting Coulombic efficiency.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces

Liquid Metal Electrodes for Energy Storage Batteries,"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe increasing demands for integration of renewable energy into the grid and urgently needed devices for peak shaving and power rating of the grid both call for low-cost and large-scale energy storage technologies. The use of secondary batteries is considered one of the most effective approaches to solving the intermittency of renewables and smoothing the power fluctuations of the grid. In these batteries, the states of the electrode highly affect the performance and manufacturing process of the battery, and therefore leverage the price of the battery. A battery with liquid metal electrodes is easy to scale up and has a low cost and long cycle life.

The electrochemistry with lithium versus sodium of selenium confined to slit micropores in carbon,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Substitution of selenium for sulfur in the cathode of a rechargeable battery containing Sx molecules in microporous slits in carbon allows a better characterization of the electrochemical reactions that occur. Paired with a metallic lithium anode, the Sex chains are converted to Li2Se in a single-step reaction. With a sodium anode, a sequential chemical reaction is characterized by a continuous chain shortening of Sex upon initial discharge before completing the reduction to Na2Se; on charge, the reconstituted Sex molecules retain a smaller x value than the original Sex chain molecule. In both cases, the Se molecules remain almost completely confined to the micropore slits to give a long cycle life.",Nano Letters
High-Energy-Density Lithium-Sulfur Batteries Based on Blade-Cast Pure Sulfur Electrodes,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.A facile pure sulfur electrode strategy is demonstrated to increase the areal loading of blade-cast sulfur electrodes and improve the electrochemical performances of thick sulfur electrodes with consideration for scale-up in practical, commercial applications. Benefiting from the unique pure sulfur electrode and an upper current collector design, the pure sulfur electrode displays low polarization, high sulfur utilization, and promising cycling stability even with an ultrahigh sulfur loading. A high areal capacity of 19.2 mAhcm-2 has been achieved, which is the highest areal capacity for the reported blade-cast sulfur electrodes and 4 times higher than that of available lithium-ion battery electrodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the use of large-sized sulfur particles only slightly decreases the rate of conversion from S8 to S4 2- during the initial discharge and has negligible impact on subsequent electrochemical performance.",ACS Energy Letters
Inverse vulcanization of bismaleimide and divinylbenzene by elemental sulfur for lithium sulfur batteries,"© 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.A novel approach to fabricate sulfur rich thermosets as materials for Li-S batteries is described. For this purpose, polybismaleimide copolymers were synthesized by reacting bismaleimide (BMI) monomer and elemental sulfur at 180 °C. Parameters such as monomers and feed ratios on the polymerization were studied. Divinylbenzenes were also used in the formulation to increase sulfur feed ratios up to 70 wt%. The thermal stability of the copolymers was also investigated by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). BMI based copolymers had shown excellent thermal stability and yielded up to 40% char yield at 800 °C. The obtained insoluble copolymers were used in Li-S battery applications. Thus, galvanostatic discharge-charge experiments were carried out to evaluate the electrochemical performance of these materials. Both 30% sulfur containing, poly(S-BMI)30%, and 70% sulfur containing, Poly(S-BMI-DVB)70%, composites exhibited a staircase voltage profile which is typical for Li-S batteries.

Sodium Ion Transport Mechanisms in Antiperovskite Electrolytes Na3OBr and Na4OI2: An in Situ Neutron Diffraction Study,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Na-rich antiperovskites are recently developed solid electrolytes with enhanced sodium ionic conductivity and show promising functionality as a novel solid electrolyte in an all solid-state battery. In this work, the sodium ionic transport pathways of the parent compound Na3OBr, as well as the modified layered antiperovskite Na4OI2, were studied and compared through temperature-dependent neutron diffraction combined with the maximum entropy method. In the cubic Na3OBr antiperovskite, the nuclear density distribution maps at 500 K indicate that sodium ions hop within and among oxygen octahedra, and Br- ions are not involved. In the tetragonal Na4OI2 antiperovskite, Na ions, which connect octahedra in the ab plane, have the lowest activation energy barrier.

A stable room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery,"High-energy rechargeable batteries based on earth-abundant materials are important for mobile and stationary storage technologies. Rechargeable sodium-sulfur batteries able to operate stably at room temperature are among the most sought-after platforms because such cells take advantage of a two-electron-redox process to achieve high storage capacity from inexpensive electrode materials. Here we report a room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery that uses a microporous carbon-sulfur composite cathode, and a liquid carbonate electrolyte containing the ionic liquid 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium-chlorate tethered to SiO2 nanoparticles. We show that these cells can cycle stably at a rate of 0.5 C (1 C=1675, mAh g-1) with 600 mAh g-1 reversible capacity and nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency. By means of spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis, we find that the particles form a sodium-ion conductive film on the anode, which stabilizes deposition of sodium. We also find that sulfur remains interred in the carbon pores and undergo solid-state electrochemical reactions with sodium ions.",Nature Communications

Carbon Materials for Lithium Sulfur Batteries - Ten Critical Questions,"© 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Lithium-sulfur batteries are among the most promising electrochemical energy storage devices of the near future. Especially the low price and abundant availability of sulfur as the cathode material and the high theoretical capacity in comparison to state-of-the art lithium-ion technologies are attractive features. Despite significant research achievements that have been made over the last years, fundamental (electro-) chemical questions still remain unanswered. This review addresses ten crucial questions associated with lithium-sulfur batteries and critically evaluates current research with respect to them. The sulfur-carbon composite cathode is a particular focus, but its complex interplay with other hardware components in the cell, such as the electrolyte and the anode, necessitates a critical discussion of other cell components. Modern in situ characterisation methods are ideally suited to illuminate the role of each component. This article does not pretend to summarise all recently published data, but instead is a critical overview over lithium-sulfur batteries based on recent research findings.",Chemistry - A European Journal
Preparation and characterization of a ZrO2-TiO2-co-doped Na-β′′-Al2O3 ceramic thin film,© 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reservedThis work focused on the preparation and characterization of a Mg2+ stabilized 8wt%-ZrO2-2wt%-TiO2-co-doped Na-β′′-Al2O3 ceramic thin film. A fine powder with high β′′-phase (Na1.76Mg0.67Al10.33O17) purity of 96.86% was obtained by a modified solid state reaction.

Understanding the Size-Dependent Sodium Storage Properties of Na2C6O6-Based Organic Electrodes for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Organic electroactive materials represent a new generation of sustainable energy storage technology due to their unique features including environmental benignity, material sustainability, and highly tailorable properties. Here a carbonyl-based organic salt Na2C6O6, sodium rhodizonate (SR) dibasic, is systematically investigated for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. A combination of structural control, electrochemical analysis, and computational simulation show that rational morphological control can lead to significantly improved sodium storage performance. A facile antisolvent method was developed to synthesize microbulk, microrod, and nanorod structured SRs, which exhibit strong size-dependent sodium ion storage properties. The SR nanorod exhibited the best performance to deliver a reversible capacity of ∼190 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C with over 90% retention after 100 cycles. At a high rate of 10 C, 50% of the capacity can be obtained due to enhanced reaction kinetics, and such high electrochemical activity maintains even at 80 °C. These results demonstrate a generic design route toward high-performance organic-based electrode materials for beyond Li-ion batteries. Using such a biomass-derived organic electrode material enables access to sustainable energy storage devices with low cost, high electrochemical performance and thermal stability.",Nano Letters

Diffusion Mechanism of the Sodium-Ion Solid Electrolyte Na3PS4 and Potential Improvements of Halogen Doping,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Density functional theory (DFT) molecular dynamics (MD)-simulations were performed on cubic and tetragonal Na3PS4. The MD simulations show that the Na-conductivity based on the predicted self-diffusion is high in both the cubic and tetragonal phases. Higher Na-ion conductivity in Na3PS4 can be obtained by introducing Na-ion vacancies. Just 2% vacancies result in a conductivity of 0.2 S/cm, which is an order of magnitude larger than the calculated conductivity of the stoichiometric compound. MD simulations of halogen-doped cubic Na3PS4 suggest a practical route to introduce vacancies, where Br-doping is predicted to result in the highest bulk conductivity. Detailed investigation of the Na-ion transitions during the MD simulation reveals the role of vacancies and phonons in the diffusion mechanism. Furthermore, the orders of magnitude difference between the MD simulations and experiments suggest that macroscopic conductivity can be significantly increased by reducing the grain boundary resistance.",Chemistry of Materials

Dynamic formation of a solid-liquid electrolyte interphase and its consequences for hybrid-battery concepts,"© 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.The discharging and charging of batteries require ion transfer across phase boundaries. In conventional lithium-ion batteries, Li + ions have to cross the liquid electrolyte and only need to pass the electrode interfaces. Future high-energy batteries may need to work as hybrids, and so serially combine a liquid electrolyte and a solid electrolyte to suppress unwanted redox shuttles. This adds new interfaces that might significantly decrease the cycling-rate capability. Here we show that the interface between a typical fast-ion-conducting solid electrolyte and a conventional liquid electrolyte is chemically unstable and forms a resistive solid-liquid electrolyte interphase (SLEI). Insights into the kinetics of this new type of interphase are obtained by impedance studies of a two-chamber cell. The chemistry of the SLEI, its growth with time and the influence of water impurities are examined by state-of-the-art surface analysis and depth profiling.",Nature Chemistry
Insights into the Chemical Nature and Formation Mechanisms of Discharge Products in Na-O2 Batteries by Means of Operando X-ray Diffraction,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.The chemical nature of discharge products in nonaqueous Na-O2 batteries attracts attention due to the differing electrochemical behavior of seemingly similar battery cells forming either sodium peroxide (Na2O2) or sodium superoxide (NaO2). The experimental control parameters for the exclusive formation of one or the other phase during discharge are still unknown. In this paper, the important role of gas phase moisture on the chemical nature of these products is demonstrated by means of operando XRD. Operando XRD is rarely reported for alkali-O2 systems but provides valuable real time information about the solid discharge products, growth/decomposition rates, and side reactions in the cell. In addition, the discharge/charge mechanisms of Na2O2·2H2O are monitored in detail evidencing important differences from the cell reactions forming NaO2 and Li2O2 and refuting previous incorrect conclusions. Moreover, the effect of the applied potential window during cycling is discussed, as it provides valuable information for the future development of Na-O2 batteries as electrochemical energy stores.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Direct Observation of the Interfacial Instability of the Fast Ionic Conductor Li10GeP2S12 at the Lithium Metal Anode,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.The very high ionic conductivity of Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) makes it a potential solid electrolyte for lithium all-solid-state batteries. Besides the high ionic conductivity, another key requirement is the stability of the solid electrolyte against degradation reactions with the electrodes; here, we analyze the reaction of LGPS with lithium metal. In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in combination with time-resolved electrochemical measurements offers detailed information on the chemical reactions at the Li/LGPS interface. The decomposition of Li10GeP2S12 leads to the formation of an interphase composed of Li3P, Li2S, and Li-Ge alloy, which is in perfect agreement with theoretical predictions, and an increase of the interfacial resistance. These results highlight the necessity to perform long-term, time-resolved electrochemical measurements when evaluating potential new solid electrolytes for solid-state batteries. The kinetics of this interphase growth - comparable to SEI formation on lithium anodes in liquid electrolytes - seems to be governed by diffusion across the interphase, as a square root time dependence is observed.",Chemistry of Materials
Identifying Reactive Sites and Transport Limitations of Oxygen Reactions in Aprotic Lithium-O2 Batteries at the Stage of Sudden Death,"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Discharging of the aprotic Li-O2 battery relies on the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) forming solid Li2O2 in the positive electrode, which is often characterized by a sharp voltage drop (that is, sudden death) at the end of discharge, delivering a capacity far below its theoretical promise. Toward unlocking the energy capabilities of Li-O2 batteries, it is crucial to have a fundamental understanding of the origin of sudden death in terms of reactive sites and transport limitations. Herein, a mechanistic study is presented on a model system of Au|Li2O2|Li+ electrolyte, in which the Au electrode was passivated with a thin Li2O2 film by discharging to the state of sudden death. Direct conductivity measurement of the Li2O2 film and in situ spectroscopic study of ORR using 18O2 for passivation and 16O2 for further discharging provide compelling evidence that ORR (and O2 evolution reaction as well) occurs at the buried interface of Au|Li2O2 and is limited by electron instead of Li+ and O2 transport. Direct conductivity measurement of an electrodeposited Li2O2 film and an insitu SERS study on the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) using 18O2 for passivation and 16O2 for further discharging unveiled the origin of sudden death of aprotic Li-O2 batteries. Both ORR and O2 evolution (OER) occur at the buried interface of cathode|Li2O2, and thus the Li-O2 electrochemistry is limited by electron transport instead of Li+ and O2 transport.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Visualizing Current-Dependent Morphology and Distribution of Discharge Products in Sodium-Oxygen Battery Cathodes,"Synchrotron X-ray tomography and scanning electron microscopy were applied to elucidate the spatial distribution of discharge product (NaO 2) in the carbon cathode of sodium-oxygen batteries. Various batteries were discharged galvanostatically and their cathodes were analyzed. We observe a particle density gradient along the cathode that scales with the current density applied. Besides, we show that the particle size and shape of discharge product strongly depend on current density, and on whether the particles are deposited close to the oxygen reservoir or near the separator. We correlate our findings to transport limitations for the supplied oxygen and gain crucial information for optimal operation of sodium-oxygen batteries. Our findings imply that for low current densities pore clogging might occur, and that for elevated current densities small high surface area particles with limited electric conductivity form; both phenomena can decrease the available discharge and charge capacity significantly.",Scientific Reports
One- or Two-Electron Transfer? the Ambiguous Nature of the Discharge Products in Sodium-Oxygen Batteries,"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Rechargeable lithium-oxygen and sodium-oxygen cells have been considered as challenging concepts for next-generation batteries, both scientifically and technologically. Whereas in the case of non-aqueous Li/O2 batteries, the occurring cell reaction has been unequivocally determined (Li2O2 formation), the situation is much less clear in the case of non-aqueous Na/O2 cells. Two discharge products, with almost equal free enthalpies of formation but different numbers of transferred electrons and completely different kinetics, appear to compete, namely NaO2 and Na2O2. Cells forming either the superoxide or the peroxide have been reported, but it is unclear how the cell reaction can be influenced for selective one- or two-electron transfer to occur. In this Minireview, we summarize available data, discuss important control parameters, and offer perspectives for further research. Water and proton sources appear to play major roles.",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition
Progress in electrolytes for rechargeable Li-based batteries and beyond,"© 2016 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of SciencesOwing to almost unmatched volumetric energy density, Li-based batteries have dominated the portable electronic industry for the past 20 years.

NaCrO2 and hard carbon (HC) were used as positive electrode and negative electrode active materials, respectively, and their fundamental charge–discharge characteristics were examined with coin-type half-cells. A 1.5 mAh coin-type full cell composed of HC/NaCrO2 showed excellent cycle properties, maintaining 90 % of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 333 and 363 K. The 1.5 mAh full cell also exhibited a high charge–discharge energy efficiency of 97.5 % at 363 K and C/5 rate. A large-sized prismatic HC/NaCrO2 full cell with a capacity of 27 Ah was fabricated by a mass production process, and its performance was confirmed to be comparable with that of the 1.5 mAh coin-type cell.

KGaA, Weinheim.A novel combination of hard carbon anode sodium pre-loading and a tailored electrolyte is used to prepare room temperature sodium-sulfur full cell batteries. The electrochemical loading with sodium ions is realized in a specific mixture of diethyl carbonate, ethylene carbonate, and fluoroethylene carbonate electrolyte in order to create a first solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the anode surface. Combining such anodes with a porous carbon/sulfur composite cathode results in full cells with a significantly decreased polysulfide shuttle when compared to half cells combined with metallic sodium anodes. Further optimization involves the use of Na2S/P2S5 doped tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether based electrolyte in the full cell for the formation of a second SEI, reducing polysulfide shuttle even further. More importantly, the electrochemical discharge processes in the cell are improved by adding this dissolved complexation agent to the electrolyte. As a result of this combination sodium-sulfur cells with tailored cathode materials and electrolytes can achieve high discharge capacities up to 980 mAh g-1 sulfur and 1000 cycles with 200 mAh g-1 sulfur remaining capacity, at room temperature.",Advanced Energy Materials
Stable Crystalline Forms of Na Polysulfides: Experiment versus Ab Initio Computational Prediction,"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.For the design of light-metal-sulfur batteries and for the understanding of their performance, knowledge on the stable crystalline polysulfides is very important. We confronted experimental and ab initio crystal structure prediction studies on the stability of Na polysulfides. The selected evolutionary-based structure-prediction algorithm was able to quickly and correctly predict the thermodynamically stable crystalline forms of Na polysulfides with small unit cells. For Na polysulfides with large unit cells, the algorithm correctly proposed short unbranched polysulfide chains to be energetically favorite structural motifs, but could not find proper three-dimensional structures in the limited number of generations. Experimentally, the polysulfides were studied by X-ray diffraction and 23Na solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Complemented by calculations of the isotropic chemical shifts and quadrupolar coupling constants, NMR spectroscopy proved to be an excellent tool for the examination of Na polysulfides, because it allowed easy distinction and quantification of components in the samples.",Chemistry - A European Journal
Interphase formation and degradation of charge transfer kinetics between a lithium metal anode and highly crystalline Li7P3S11 solid electrolyte,"© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.The properties of the interface between solid electrolytes and electrode materials are of vital importance for the performance of all solid-state batteries (ASSB). Unwanted reactions between alkali metal electrodes and the solid electrolyte can lead to the formation of compounds that either facilitate or block the ion transfer kinetics. In particular for lithium solid electrolytes in the Li2S-P2S5 system with very high lithium ion conductivity only little is known about interfacial reactions with lithium metal. Here we monitor the formation of an interphase between Li7P3S11 and lithium metal by a combined analytical approach, comprising in situ photoelectron spectroscopy and time-dependent electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Utilizing a self-developed XPS peak fit model for Li7P3S11, we identify the components of this interphase, discuss its properties and develop a qualitative model, which shows that the reaction between electrolyte and lithium metal, and hence, the interphase growth, is limited to a few nm. The solid electrolyte being used is a highly crystalline form of the superionic conductor Li7P3S11 without any residual glassy phase, and the synthesis of this Li7P3S11 phase is also reported.",Solid State Ionics
A singular flexible cathode for room temperature sodium/sulfur battery,"© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.This study introduces a new flexible cathode that contains no binder, conductive additive and current collector, but instead consists solely of a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile nanofiber (SPAN) web which is prepared by a simple pyrolysis process with low cost raw materials. This not only exhibits good electrochemical properties, but also a high flexibility, rollability, and bendability to 180° without fracture. Its feasibility as a cathode for a low cost and flexible Na/S battery is subsequently evaluated on the basis that S, PAN, and Na are cheap materials. The SPAN web delivers a high first discharge capacity of 604 mAh g-1 - electrode (1473 mAh g-1 - sulfur) at 0.01 C based on sulfur content. In cycle performance at 0.1 C, a first discharge capacity of 342 mAh g-1 - electrode is obtained and remains over 266 mAh g-1 - electrode after 200 cycles along with the coulombic efficiency near 100% from the second cycle. In terms of rate capability, it is shown to be capable of delivering a capacity of as high as 71 mAh g-1 at 1 C. The reversible electrochemical reaction of the SPAN web with Na is related to a reversible bond between the C-S and S-S bonds of the SPAN web.",Journal of Power Sources
Probing the Sodiation-Desodiation Reactions in Nano-sized Iron Fluoride Cathode,"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.A hybrid nanocomposite of FeF3·0.5H2O and MWCNTs is synthesized as a high-performance cathode material for room-temperature sodium-ion batteries. The composite exhibits remarkably high capacity (197 mAh g-1) and stable cycle performance (148 mAh g-1 at the 100th cycle with a 0.05 C rate) accompanying with the unique nanostructure of the material and the incorporation of MWCNTs. The addition of MWCNTs not only increases the conductivity of the active material but also plays a role to design a unique morphology where nano-sized FeF3·0.5H2O particles are grown both inside and outside of the MWCNTs. The sodium diffusion coefficient of the composite material is determined by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique during dis/charging and the values are in the range of 10-12-10-14 cm2 s-1 which are lesser than lithium diffusion coefficient of FeF3 (10-10-10-12 cm2 s-1). In situ X-ray diffraction coupled with ex situ high resolution transmission electron microscopy is employed to investigate the phase transition behavior. The results reveal both crystalline and amorphous phases upon Na insertion. Furthermore, ex situ NEXAFS spectroscopy (at the F K-edge and Fe L3-edge) is conducted at different potential steps to determine the change in oxidation state and local structure. NEXAFS spectra reveal the conversion reaction mechanism and reversibility of the material as evidenced by the de/formation of NaF during de/sodiation process. The combined study of in situ XRD and NEXAFS will give valuable information on de/sodiation reactions in FeF3·0.5H2O.",Electrochimica Acta
Performance Enhancement and Mechanistic Studies of Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries with a Carbon-Coated Functional Nafion Separator and a Na2S/Activated Carbon Nanofiber Cathode,"© 2016 American Chemical Society.Operation of sodium-sulfur batteries at room temperature has been proposed and studied for about a decade, but polysulfide-shuttle through the traditional battery separator and low-utilization of the sulfur cathode commonly have been the major challenges. Also, because of the highly active nature of the sodium metal, the conventional room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery concept with the sodium-metal anode and elemental sulfur cathode imposes serious safety concerns. To overcome the above difficulties, we present here a RT Na-S system with an advanced membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) comprising a carbon-coated, presodiated Nafion membrane (Na-Nafion) and a sodium sulfide (Na2S) cathode. The Na-Nafion membrane provides a facile Na+-ion conductive path and serves as a cation-selective shield to prevent the migration of the polysulfides to the anode. The carbon coating on the Na-Nafion plays an upper-current-collector role and thereby improves the electrochemical utilization of the active Na2S. Employing Na2S as the cathode provides a pathway to develop the RT Na-S batteries with sodium-metal-free anodes. The RT Na-S battery with the above MEA exhibits remarkably enhanced capacity and cyclability in contrast to the Na-S batteries with the conventional electrolyte-separator configuration. Mechanistic studies reveal that the suppression of polysulfide migration through the Na-Nafion is due to size and electronic effects.",Chemistry of Materials
Three-dimensional porous carbon composites containing high sulfur nanoparticle content for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"Sulfur is a promising cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries because of its high theoretical capacity (1,675 mA h g-1); however, its low electrical conductivity and the instability of sulfur-based electrodes limit its practical application. Here we report a facile in situ method for preparing three-dimensional porous graphitic carbon composites containing sulfur nanoparticles (3D S@PGC). With this strategy, the sulfur content of the composites can be tuned to a high level (up to 90 wt%). Because of the high sulfur content, the nanoscale distribution of the sulfur particles, and the covalent bonding between the sulfur and the PGC, the developed 3D S@PGC cathodes exhibit excellent performance, with a high sulfur utilization, high specific capacity (1,382, 1,242 and 1,115 mA h g-1 at 0.5, 1 and 2 C, respectively), long cycling life (small capacity decay of 0.039% per cycle over 1,000 cycles at 2 C) and excellent rate capability at a high charge/discharge current.",Nature Communications
Current trends and future challenges of electrolytes for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.Research and development efforts on sodium-ion batteries are gaining momentum due to their potential to accommodate high energy density coupled with relatively lower cost in comparison with lithium-ion batteries. In order for the sodium-ion batteries to be commercially viable, high performance electrolytes with acceptable ambient temperature ionic conductivity and wider electrochemical stability windows are being developed. A bibliometric analysis of the publications on various types of Na+ ion conducting electrolytes since 1990 shows a total of 200 + publications and reveals an exponential growth in the last few years, due to reasons that the sodium-ion systems promise great potential as the future large scale power sources for variety of applications. This review consolidates the status of liquid (non-aqueous, aqueous and ionic), polymer gel and solid (ceramics, glasses, and solid polymers) electrolytes and discusses their ionic conductivity, thermal characteristics, electrochemical stability and viscosity towards applications in sodium-ion batteries. Among various types available, the non-aqueous solvent based electrolyte is the most promising one in terms of ionic conductivity even though it is flammable.",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
Reaction mechanism and surface film formation of conversion materials for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries: An XPS case study on sputtered copper oxide (CuO) thin film model electrodes,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.Charge storage based on conversion reactions is a promising concept to store electrical energy. Many studies have been devoted to conversion reactions with lithium; however, still many scientific questions remain due to the complexity of the reaction mechanism combined with surface film formation. Replacing lithium by sodium is an attractive approach to widen the scope of conversion reactions and to study whether the increase in ion size changes the reaction mechanisms and whether the cell performance benefits or worsens. In this study, we use thin film electrodes as a additive-free model system to study the conversion reaction of CuO with sodium (CuO/Na) by means of electrochemical methods, microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The reaction mechanism and film formation are being discussed. Some important differences to the analogue lithium-based system (CuO/Li) are found. Whereas CuO has been reported as charge product in CuO/Li cells, charging is incomplete in the case of CuO/Na and only Cu2O is formed. As an important finding, oxygen appears to be redox active and Na2O2 forms during charging from Na2O. Moreover, surface film formation due to electrolyte decomposition is much more severe as compared to CuO/Li. Depth profiling is used to probe the inner composition of the surface film, revealing a much thicker surface film with more inorganic components as compared to the lithium system. It is also found that the surface film disappears to a large extent during charging.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C

Graphite-Nanoplate-Coated Bi2S3 Composite with High-Volume Energy Density and Excellent Cycle Life for Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfide Batteries,"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Graphite-nanoplate-coated Bi2S3 composite (Bi2S3@C) has been prepared by a simple, scalable, and energy-efficient precipitation method combined with ball milling. The Bi2S3@C composite was used as the cathode material for sodium-sulfide batteries. It delivered an initial capacity of 550 mAhg-1 and high stable specific energy in the range of 275-300 Whkg-1 at 0.1 C, with an enhanced capacity retention of 69 % over 100 cycles. The unique structure demonstrates superior cycling stability, with a capacity drop of 0.3 % per cycle over 100 cycles, compared with that of bare Bi2S3. The sodium storage mechanism of Bi2S3 was investigated based on ex situ X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy.",Chemistry - A European Journal
The O2-assisted Al/CO2 electrochemical cell: A system for CO2 capture/conversion and electric power generation,"© 2016 The Authors.Economical and efficient carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration technologies are a requirement for successful implementation of global action plans to reduce carbon emissions and to mitigate climate change. These technologies are also essential for longer-term use of fossil fuels while reducing the associated carbon footprint. We demonstrate an O2-assisted Al/CO2 electrochemical cell as a new approach to sequester CO2 emissions and, at the same time, to generate substantial amounts of electrical energy. We report on the fundamental principles that guide operations of these cells using multiple intrusive electrochemical and physical analytical methods, including chron-opotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, direct analysis in real-time mass spectrometry, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and coupled thermogravimetric analysis–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. On this basis, we demonstrate that an electrochemical cell that uses metallic aluminum as anode and a carbon dioxide/oxygen gas mixture as the active material in the cathode provides a path toward electrochemical generation of a valuable (C2) species and electrical energy. Specifically, we show that the cell first reduces O2 at the cathode to form superoxide intermediates. Chemical reaction of the superoxide with CO2 sequesters the CO2 in the form of aluminum oxalate, Al2(C2O4)3, as the dominant product. On the basis of an analysis of the overall CO2 footprint, which considers emissions associated with the production of the aluminum anode and the CO2 captured/ abated by the Al/CO2-O2 electrochemical cell, we conclude that the proposed process offers an important strategy for net reduction of CO2 emissions.",Science Advances
Greigite Fe3S4 as a new anode material for high-performance sodium-ion batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Transition metal dichalcogenide materials have been considered as promising anode materials for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries because of their high specific capacity and low cost. Here, we demonstrate an iron sulfide Fe3S4 as a new anode material for a rechargeable sodium-ion battery. The involved conversion mechanism has been proved when the as-prepared Fe3S4 was used as the host material for sodium storage. Remarkably, a compound FeSx with quantum size generated by conversion reaction overcame the kinetic and thermodynamic constraints of chemical conversion to achieve superior cycling and rate capability. As a result, the as-prepared Fe3S4 electrode delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 548 mA h g1 at 0.2 A g1, together with an excellent cycling stability of 275 mA h g1 after 3500 cycles at 20 A g1",Chemical Science
Interfacial behaviours between lithium ion conductors and electrode materials in various battery systems,"© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.In recent years room temperature Li+ ion conductors have been intensively revisited in an attempt to develop solid state batteries that can be deployed for vehicle electrification. Through careful modification on materials synthesis, promising solid Li+ conductors with competitive ionic conductivity to those of liquid electrolytes have been demonstrated. However, the integration of highly conductive solid electrolytes into the whole system is still very challenging mainly due to the high impedance existing at different interfaces throughout the battery structure. Herein, this work focuses on the overview of the interfacial behaviors between lithium ion (Li-ion) conductors and cathode/anode materials. The origin, evolution and potential solutions to reduce these interfacial impedances are reviewed for various battery systems spanning from Li-ion, lithium sulfur (Li-S), lithium oxygen (Li-O2) batteries to lithium metal protection.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Effect of sodium salt in poly(ethylene oxide) electrolyte on initial discharge capacity of Na/poly(ethylene oxide)/S battery,"© 2016, Hanyang University. All rights reserved.To investigate the effects of sodium salt in a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolyte on the initial discharge properties of a Na/S cell, various concentrations of NaCF3SO3 from 0.1 to 2.0 m were added to the electrolyte. Scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry results showed a continuous decrease in the crystallinity of the PEO electrolyte with increasing amounts of sodium salt. The ionic conductivity of the PEO electrolyte at 70 °C increased with increasing sodium salt concentration up to 0.33 m, at which point the highest ionic conductivity of 1.732 × 10−4 S cm−1 was obtained. However, the ionic conductivity decreased at 2.0 m sodium salt. The same trend was seen in the initial discharge capacity, in that the highest value of 435 mAh g−1 was achieved at a sodium salt concentration of 0.33 m. These results demonstrate that 0.33 m of sodium salt is the optimum composition for Na/S batteries.",Journal of Ceramic Processing Research

A nitrogen doped carbonized metal-organic framework for high stability room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.A nanoporous nitrogen doped carbon matrix was prepared by carbonization of metal-organic framework zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) precursors. The doped carbon matrix was melt-infiltrated with sulfur to form a carbonized ZIF-8/S composite. The composite material exhibited good performance as the cathode for room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery (Na-S) systems. A reversible specific capacity of around 1000 mA h g-1 could be achieved at a rate of 0.1C; and a reversible specific capacity of 500 mA h g-1 was obtained at a rate of 0.2C after 250 cycles. The good performance of the Na-S battery could be attributed to the synergistic effect from the nanoporosity of the carbon matrix and the high nitrogen-doping content (ca. ∼18 at%). These attributes enhanced the entrapment of the sulfur molecules inside the carbon matrices.,Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Synthesis and characterization of NiO doped beta-Al2O3solid electrolyte,"© 2016 Elsevier B.V.The beta-Al2O3solid electrolyte with NiO doped and Li2O stabilized is synthesized via the solid state reaction method, which is starting with α-Al2O3, Li2CO3, Na2C2O4and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O as the raw materials. Effects of the NiO content on the mechanical and electrical performances are studied by means of thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Meanwhile, the relative density, the bending strength and the electrical properties of the prepared samples are also measured in this paper. The beta-Al2O3solid electrolyte with the appropriate amount of NiO has a higher β″-Al2O3phase content and uniform microstructure with dense and plump grains. However, the excess NiO doping can lead the grain to molten state and make the pores become larger. It deteriorates the ionic conductivity. When the NiO content of the beta-Al2O3solid electrolyte is 0.25 wt%, the β″-Al2O3phase content is 98.91%, the microstructure is uniform and compact, the relative density is 98.73% of theoretical density, the bending strength is up to 296 MPa and the ionic conductivity can reach 0.066 S cm−1at 350 °C.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Electrical properties of sodium beta-alumina ceramics synthesized by citrate sol-gel route using glycerine,"Sodium beta-alumina is an efficient ion conducting solid electrolyte due to fast ionic conductivity arising from its favourable crystal structure. Other main requirements of a material to serve as solid electrolyte are fine grain structure, minimum porosity and good electrical properties at the operating temperature, which is usually about 300 °C. Mg-doped sodium beta-alumina powder was synthesized using citrate sol-gel route (wherein glycerine was used as a fuel) and calcined at different temperatures (950-1100 °C). The synthesized powders haveβ′′-alumina as a dominant phase and particle size in range 75-95 nm. The obtained powders were compacted by uniaxial pressing at 100MPa and sintered at 1500 °C for 3-10 h. Maximal density of the sintered samples was 92%TD and the primary phase was β′′-alumina. The highest conductivity of 0.38 S/cm was measured at 300 °C and the lowest activation energy for conduction of 0.20 eV was obtained.",Processing and Application of Ceramics
Optimized nitrogen-doped carbon with a hierarchically porous structure as a highly efficient cathode for Na-O2 batteries,"© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Development of an efficient air cathode for metal-air batteries composed of an element that is abundant on earth is a scientific and technical challenge. Here, nitrogen (N)-doped carbon cathodes were prepared using two conventional doping methods, namely ammonia activation (ammoxidation) and introduction of an N-containing precursor. Interestingly, the introduction of N-containing precursors to prepare the N-doped carbon material not only gave a different pore distribution with increased surface area but also maintained considerable N content, unlike the use of the ammoxidation method-thus greatly enhancing the catalytic activity (low overpotential) and improving the discharge capacity (6905 mA h g-1) and cycle life (from 8 to 66 cycles) in sodium-oxygen batteries compared with the pure carbon material. This study also stresses the importance of adopting the optimized synthesis method to prepare the N-doped carbon cathode.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Aqueous sol-gel synthesized anatase TiO2 nanoplates with high-rate capabilities for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.Anatase nanoplates were successfully synthesized by a sol-gel method and exhibit superior electrochemical performance in LIBs and SIBs. Nanoplates with 10 nm particle sizes were produced by thermally decomposed titanium-terephthalate hybrid materials. In LIBs, the anatase nanoplates deliver a 100 mA h g-1 capacity at 10C, maintaining 150 mA h g-1 capacity at 5C for 500 cycles. Anatase with high crystallinity exhibits fairly good rate capability in SIBs, delivering 53 mA h g-1 capacity at 30C. Using ex situ X-ray diffractometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, anatase was discovered to trap Na, forming metallic Ti0 and amorphous sodium titanate in the chemical states of Ti3+ and Ti2+. The sodium titanate is structurally stable and electrochemically reversible with the redox couple of Ti4+/Ti3+. It is suggested that pseudocapacitance comprises most of the capacity in the first cycle. After the activation, anatase gradually stores more capacity by insertion. Therefore, it is demonstrated that anatase nanoplates with this promising insertive/extractive host structure are promising anode materials for LIBs and SIBs.",RSC Advances
Glass ceramic separators for room temperature operating sodium batteries,"Promising compositions of solid electrolyte materials can be obtained with several compositions by various synthesis routes, like regular melt-quench process or producing NASlCON-type glass ceramic, via sol-gel- or oxide synthesis, followed by calcination and ball milling to fine powders. These powders are transferred into slurries followed by tape casting of thin ceramic foils. Sintering is the most challenging step of the entire process. Cracking, bulging, warping and bloating have to be eliminated to get a plane and dense electrolyte substrate. NASICON-type glass ceramic compositions from the Na2O-REO-SiO2-system (REO-rare earth oxides) with and without additions of P2O5 have been prepared via glass melting, quenching on different materials, grinding to powder with subsequent sintering and crystallization after shaping steps like cold uniaxial pressing and tape casting.

Highly porous polyacrylonitrile/graphene oxide membrane separator exhibiting excellent anti-self-discharge feature for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been considered as a promising candidate for next-generation energy-storage devices due to their high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, the severe self-discharge behavior of Li-S batteries strongly limits their use in practical applications. Here, we report a sustainable and highly porous polyacrylonitrile/graphene oxide (PAN/GO) nanofiber membrane separator that simultaneously enables large capacity and excellent anti-self-discharge capability for lithium-sulfur batteries. A low retention loss (5%) can be achieved even after a resting time of 24 h. Besides benefitting from the highly porous structure and excellent electrolyte wettability of the nanofiber separator, the improved performance can also be ascribed to the excellent barrier effects caused by the relatively high energy binding between -C≡N and Li2S/polysulfides and the electrostatic interactions between GO and negatively charged species (Sn2-). It is, therefore, demonstrated that this GO incorporated PAN nanofiber separator with highly porous structure and excellent electrolyte wettability is a promising separator candidate for high-performance Li-S batteries.",Carbon

Sodium polysulfides during charge/discharge of the room-temperature Na/S battery using TEGDME electrolyte,"© 2016 The Electrochemical Society.The charge-discharge process of the room-temperature Na/S battery is studied using the Na/S cell with tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) and the solid electrolyte. The solid electrolyte is a barrier for chemical mass transport between the anode and the cathode. The sodium polysulfides as reaction products in TEGDME could therefore be investigated without interference from the anode side. During discharge, the color of the TEGDME electrolyte changes from transparent to brown, yellowish-green, and then back to transparent, and in the reverse order during charge. The first three colors are well-matched with those of prepared TEGDME solutions of Na2Sn (6 ≤ n ≤ 8), Na2S4 and Na2S, respectively. The solubility of sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn, 1 ≤ n ≤ 8) in TEGDME are measured systematically. The dissolution of sodium polysulfides is found to depend on the molar concentration of sulfur. The optimized Na/S cell using activated carbon delivers a high capacity of 1070 mAh g-1at the first discharge, and remains at 782 mAh g-1 after 37 cycles. It also shows good rate capability with a discharge capacity of 569 mAh g-1at 1/2 C. The coulombic efficiency is nearly 100% after the 5th cycle.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society

This study reports the preparation of sulfur cathodes by using bimodal microporous (0.5 nm and 0.8 nm to 2.0 nm) carbon spheres with high specific area (1992 m2 g-1) and large micropore volume (1.2 g cm-1), as well as the encapsulation of polysulfides via formation of carbon-sulfur bonds in a sealed vacuum glass tube at high temperature. Given that sulfur and polysulfides are well confined by the S-C bond, the shuttle effect is effectively suppressed. The prepared S/C cathodes with a sulfur loading of up to 75% demonstrate high sulfur activity with reversible capacity of 1000 mA h g-1 at the current density of 0.1 A g-1 and good cycling stability (667 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles).",Electrochimica Acta
High-Capacity Te Anode Confined in Microporous Carbon for Long-Life Na-Ion Batteries,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted considerable attention as an alternative energy-storage technology in recent years. Developing advanced sodium storage anode materials with appropriate working potential, high capacity, and good cycling performance is very important. Herein, we demonstrate a nanostructured tellurium@carbon (nano-Te@C) composite by confining nano-Te molecules in the space of carbon micropores as an attractive anode material for SIBs. The nano-Te@C anode presents an appropriate redox potential in the range of 1.05-1.35 V (vs Na+/Na), which avoids the Na dendrite problem and achieves a high reversible capacity of 410 mA h g-1 on the basis of a two-electron redox reaction mechanism. Notably, the nano-Te@C exhibits an admirable long-term cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 90% for 1000 cycles (i.e., ultralow capacity decay of 0.01% per cycle). The excellent electrochemical property of nano-Te@C benefits from the high electroactivity from the nanostructure design and the effective confinement of the microporous carbon host. In addition, a Na-ion full cell by using nano-Te@C as anode and Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 as cathode is demonstrated for the first time and exhibits a remarkable capacity retention up to 95% after 150 cycles. The results put new insights for the development of advanced SIBs with long-cycle lifespan.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
A highly reversible room-temperature sodium metal anode,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.Owing to its low cost and high natural abundance, sodium metal is among the most promising anode materials for energy storage technologies beyond lithium ion batteries. However, room-temperature sodium metal anodes suffer from poor reversibility during long-term plating and stripping, mainly due to formation of nonuniform solid electrolyte interphase as well as dendritic growth of sodium metal. Herein we report for the first time that a simple liquid electrolyte, sodium hexafluorophosphate in glymes (mono-, di-, and tetraglyme), can enable highly reversible and nondendritic plating-stripping of sodium metal anodes at room temperature. High average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.9% were achieved over 300 plating-stripping cycles at 0.5 mA cm-2. The long-term reversibility was found to arise from the formation of a uniform, inorganic solid electrolyte interphase made of sodium oxide and sodium fluoride, which is highly impermeable to electrolyte solvent and conducive to nondendritic growth. As a proof of concept, we also demonstrate a roomtemperature sodium-sulfur battery using this class of electrolytes, paving the way for the development of next-generation, sodium-based energy storage technologies.",ACS Central Science
Ultrafine Iron Pyrite (FeS2) Nanocrystals Improve Sodium-Sulfur and Lithium-Sulfur Conversion Reactions for Efficient Batteries,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.Nanocrystals with quantum-confined length scales are often considered impractical for metal-ion battery electrodes due to the dominance of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer effects on the measured storage properties. Here we demonstrate that ultrafine sizes (μ4.5 nm, average) of iron pyrite, or FeS2, nanoparticles are advantageous to sustain reversible conversion reactions in sodium ion and lithium ion batteries. This is attributed to a nanoparticle size comparable to or smaller than the diffusion length of Fe during cation exchange, yielding thermodynamically reversible nanodomains of converted Fe metal and NaxS or LixS conversion products. This is compared to bulk-like electrode materials, where kinetic and thermodynamic limitations of surface-nucleated conversion products inhibit successive conversion cycles. Reversible capacities over 500 and 600 mAh/g for sodium and lithium storage are observed for ultrafine nanoparticles, with improved cycling and rate capability. Unlike alloying or intercalation processes, where SEI effects limit the performance of ultrafine nanoparticles, our work highlights the benefit of quantum dot length-scale nanocrystal electrodes for nanoscale metal sulfide compounds that store energy through chemical conversion reactions.",ACS Nano
Aqueous and Nonaqueous Sodium-Air Cells with Nanoporous Gold Cathode,"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Two types of sodium-air cells, i.e., nonaqueous and mixed aqueous-nonaqueous (abbreviated as 'aqueous') cells, have been compared to elucidate factors limiting performances of nonaqueous air cells and how the aqueous electrolyte is effective to reliving these limitation. The two cells have the same configuration consisting of a nanoporous gold (NPG) air electrode and a ceramic separator of fast sodium ion conductor, NASICON. Only the selection of catholyte, either alkyl carbonate-based nonaqueous solution of NaClO4 or aqueous solution of NaOH, is different. All performances are demonstrated to be better for the aqueous one. Lower overpotential of aqueous cell leads to better round-trip efficiency. A large resistance relevant to oxygen reduction reaction in the nonaqueous cell is relieved by changing the catholyte to the aqueous electrolyte, affording higher rate capability and power density. The aqueous electrolyte is also effective to remove the limitation of the discharge capacity defined by the volumetric amount of air electrode, as has been claimed in previous studies on aqueous Na-air cells. Furthermore, the aqueous cell is demonstrated to be robust and less sensitive and to atmosphere. The NPG electrode works reversibly in the half-cell reaction of the aqueous cell, while an electrodeposition of metallic Na on the anode during charging requires an improvement.",Electrochimica Acta
Yolk-shell silicon-mesoporous carbon anode with compact solid electrolyte interphase film for superior lithium-ion batteries,"© 2015.Silicon as an electrode suffers from short cycling life, as well as unsatisfactory rate-capability caused by the large volume expansion (~400%) and the consequent structural degradation during lithiation/delithiation processes. Here, we have engineered unique void-containing mesoporous carbon-encapsulated commercial silicon nanoparticles (NPs) in yolk-shell structures. In this design, the silicon NPs yolk are wrapped into open and accessible mesoporous carbon shells, the void space between yolk and shell provides enough room for Si expansion, meanwhile, the porosity of carbon shell enables fast transport of Li+ ions between electrolyte and silicon. Our ex-situ characterization clearly reveals for the first time that a favorable homogeneous and compact solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film is formed along the mesoporous carbon shells. As a result, such yolk-shell Si@mesoporous-carbon nanoparticles with a large void exhibits long cycling stability (78.6% capacity retention as long as 400 cycles), and superior rate-capability (62.3% capacity retention at a very high current density of 8.4Ag-1).",Nano Energy

Multi-functional separator/interlayer system for high-stable lithium-sulfur batteries: Progress and prospects,"© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.The development of advanced energy storage systems is of crucial importance to meet the ever-growing demands of electric vehicles, portable devices, and renewable energy harvest. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, with the advantages in its high specific energy density, low cost of raw materials, and environmental benignity, are of great potential to serve as next-generation batteries. However, there are many obstacles towards the practical application of Li-S batteries such as the electrical insulating nature of sulfur, the volume expansion during lithium insertion, and the shuttle of soluble polysulfide intermediates that induces severe degradation of the cell performance. In this review, the progresses of multi-functional separators/interlayers in Li-S batteries are highlighted. The introduction of multi-functional separators/interlayers with unexpected multiple functionalities is beneficial for better sulfur utilization, efficient polysulfide diffusion inhibition, and anode protection. Multi-functional separator system with ion selective/electrical conductive polymer, sp2 and porous carbon, metal oxide modified separators, as well as interlinked free-standing nanocarbon, micro/mesoporous carbon, and other conductive interlayers have been proposed. The biomass derived materials was also included as interlayer for advanced Li-S batteries. These novel Li-S cell configurations with multi-functional separators/interlayers are especially suitable for Li-S batteries with high capacity, high stability, and high-rate performance. The opportunities of high-performance separators/interlayers and their applications in next-generation Li-S batteries were also involved. New insights on the role of working separators/interlayers in practical Li-S cells should be further explored to obtain the principle and process for advanced components for energy storage devices based on multi-electron conversion reactions.",Energy Storage Materials
Uniform yolk-shell iron sulfide-carbon nanospheres for superior sodium-iron sulfide batteries,"© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.Sodium-metal sulfide battery holds great promise for sustainable and cost-effective applications. Nevertheless, achieving high capacity and cycling stability remains a great challenge. Here, uniform yolk-shell iron sulfide-carbon nanospheres have been synthesized as cathode materials for the emerging sodium sulfide battery to achieve remarkable capacity of ∼545 mA h g-1 over 100 cycles at 0.2 C (100 mA g-1), delivering ultrahigh energy density of ∼438 Wh kg-1. The proven conversion reaction between sodium and iron sulfide results in high capacity but severe volume changes. Nanostructural design, including of nanosized iron sulfide yolks (∼170 nm) with porous carbon shells (∼30 nm) and extra void space (∼20 nm) in between, has been used to achieve excellent cycling performance without sacrificing capacity. This sustainable sodium-iron sulfide battery is a promising candidate for stationary energy storage. Furthermore, this spatially confined sulfuration strategy offers a general method for other yolk-shell metal sulfide-carbon composites.",Nature Communications
Fluorinated Reduced Graphene Oxide as an Interlayer in Li-S Batteries,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.We report on the synthesis of fluorinated reduced graphene oxide (F-rGO) by a direct fluorination of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with F2 or XeF2/BF3 in anhydrous HF. Characterization performed by high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and NMR confirmed the formation of C-F bonds, which is also supported by the color change from graphite gray to light yellow. F-rGO has been used as an interlayer additive supported by a glass fiber separator in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries in order to block the diffusion/migration of polysulfides from the porous positive electrode to the metallic lithium electrode and to prevent the redox shuttle effect. Electrochemical cycling of Li-S batteries has confirmed the beneficial role of F-rGO separators, with a more pronounced effect observed for high degrees of fluorination. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies have shown a direct effect on the amount of Li2S and polysulfides found on the lithium electrode and evidenced a better reversibility of reduction/oxidation mechanisms of sulfur at the positive electrode upon discharge/charge.",Chemistry of Materials
Discharge and Charge Reaction Paths in Sodium-Oxygen Batteries: Does NaO2 Form by Direct Electrochemical Growth or by Precipitation from Solution?,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.Sodium-oxygen cells with sodium superoxide (NaO2) as discharge product show charge and discharge characteristics with very low overvoltage, different from lithium/oxygen cells. Here, it is shown that the discharge of a nonaqueous sodium/oxygen cell proceeds via the electrochemical formation of superoxide (O2-), its dissolution in the liquid electrolyte, and subsequent precipitation together with sodium ions as solid sodium superoxide. Charge proceeds in the counter-direction by consumption of dissolved superoxide anions and dissolution of NaO2. Indirect evidence for the solution-precipitation route is provided by theoretical results on the electronic structure of NaO2 and the conclusion that the electronic conductivity of NaO2 is too low to allow direct electrochemical growth and dissolution. Direct evidence for the solution-precipitation route is provided by results from charge/discharge studies of a three-electrode cell in which preformed NaO2 is being decomposed without direct electronic contact to the charging circuit. An analytical model for the overvoltage as a function of electrode coverage with electrically insulating discharge product complements the theoretical and experimental results and supports the mechanistic findings.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C

Ion Dynamics in Solid Electrolytes: NMR Reveals the Elementary Steps of Li+ Hopping in the Garnet Li6.5La3Zr1.75Mo0.25O12,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.Garnet-type oxides are considered to belong to the most attractive solid Li+ electrolytes. This is due to their wide electrochemical stability window as well as their superior ionic conductivity, with a Li-ion transference number of almost one. Usually ionic conductivities are studied via impedance spectroscopy on a macroscopic length scale. Time-domain NMR methods, however, have been used much less extensively to shed light on the elementary hopping processes in highly conducting oxide garnets. Here, we used NMR relaxometry and stimulated echo NMR to study Li+ self-diffusion in Li6.5La3Zr1.75Mo0.25O12 (LLZMO), which served as a model compound to collect information on the 7Li spin dynamics. It turned out that NMR spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) recorded in both the laboratory and rotating frame of reference shows features that seem to be a universal fingerprint for fast conducting garnets that have been stabilized in their cubic modification. In contrast to Al-doped garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 that modifies the Li sublattice, in LLZMO the Li sublattice remains intact, offering the possibility to get to the bottom of Li-ion dynamics in LLZO-based garnets. Most importantly, whereas NMR SLR rates measured at 194.3 MHz reflect an almost universal behavior of local hoppings being thermally activated by only 0.151(3) eV, the spin-lock technique (33.3¯ kHz) gives evidence of two separate, overlapping rate peaks with activation energies on the order of 0.29 eV for the elementary steps of Li-ion hopping. This points to a less pronounced distribution of Li+ jump rates on the kilohertz time scale than has been observed for the Al-stabilized LLZO samples. The NMR results obtained also entail information on both the Li+ diffusion coefficients and the shape of the underlying motional correlation functions. The latter has been provided by 7Li NMR spin-alignment echo correlation spectroscopy that also shows the involvement of 24d and 96h sites in Li+ diffusion.",Chemistry of Materials

"In Situ Synthesis of Porous Carbons by Using Room-Temperature, Atmospheric-Pressure Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma as High-Performance Adsorbents for Solid-Phase Microextraction","© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.A one-step, template-free method is described to synthesize porous carbons (PCs) in situ on a metal surface by using a room-temperature, atmospheric-pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. This method not only features high efficiency, environmentally friendliness, and low cost and simple equipment, but also can conveniently realize large-area synthesis of PCs by only changing the design of the DBD reactor. The synthesized PCs have a regulated nestlike morphology, and thus, provide a high specific surface area and high pore volume, which result in excellent adsorption properties. Its applicability was demonstrated by using a PC-coated stainless-steel fiber as a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber to preconcentrate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) prior to analysis by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). The results showed that the fiber exhibited excellent enrichment factors (4.1×10<sup>4</sup> to 3.1×10<sup>5</sup>) toward all tested PAHs. Thus, the PC-based SPME-GC-FID provides low limits of detection (2 to 20ng L<sup>-1</sup>), good precision (<7.8 %), and good recoveries (80-115 %) for ultra-sensitive determination of PAHs in real water samples. In addition, the PC-coated fiber could be stable enough for more than 500 replicate extraction cycles. Power of plasma! A convenient and rapid method that uses a room-temperature, atmospheric-pressure dielectric barrier discharge plasma was developed for one-step, in situ synthesis of porous carbons for efficient headspace, solid-phase microextraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons prior to gas chromatography analysis (see figure).",Chemistry - A European Journal
Sodium ion dynamics in a sulfonate based ionomer system studied by 23Na solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and impedance spectroscopy,"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.A poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane-sulphonate) (PAMPS) ionomer containing both sodium and quaternary ammonium cations functionalised with an ether group, has been characterised in terms of its thermal properties, ionic conductivity and sodium ion dynamics. The ether oxygen was incorporated to reduce the Na+ association with the anionic sulfonate groups tethered to the polymer backbone, thereby promoting ion dissociation and ultimately enhancing the ionic conductivity. This functionalised ammonium cation led to a significant reduction in the ionomer Tg compared to an analogue system without an ether group, resulting in an increase in ionic conductivity of approximately four orders of magnitude. The sodium ion dynamics were probed by 23Na solid-state NMR, which allowed the signals from the dissociated (mobile) and bound Na+ cations to be distinguished. This demonstrates the utility of 23Na solid-state NMR as a probe of sodium dynamics in ionomer systems.",Electrochimica Acta

All rights reserved.Owing to the unique properties of certain Ionic liquids (ILs) as safe and green solvents, as well as the potential of sodium as an alternative to lithium as charge carriers, we investigate gel sodium electrolytes as safe, low cost and high performance materials with sufficient mechanical properties for application in sodium battery technologies. We investigate the effect of formation of two types of gel electrolytes on the properties of IL electrolytes known to support Na/Na<sup>+</sup> electrochemistry.

Theoretical prediction of a highly conducting solid electrolyte for sodium batteries: Na10GeP2S12,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.Using first-principles simulations, we predict a high-performance solid electrolyte with composition Na10GeP2S12 for use in sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries. The thermodynamic stability of its structure is established through determination of decomposition reaction energies and phonons, while Na-ionic conductivity is obtained using ab initio molecular dynamics at elevated temperatures. Our estimate of the room-temperature (RT) conductivity is 4.7 × 10-3 S cm-1, which is slightly higher than those of other superionic solid electrolytes such as β″-alumina and Na3Zr2Si2PO12, currently used in practical high-temperature Na-S batteries. Activation energy obtained from the Arrhenius plot (in the range 800-1400 K) is 0.2 eV, which is slightly lower than the typical values exhibited by other ceramic conductors (0.25-1 V) (Hueso et al., Energy Environ. Sci., 2013, 6, 734). We show that soft Na-S phonon modes are responsible for its thermodynamic stability and the lower activation barrier for diffusion of Na-ions. Finally, the calculated electronic bandgap of 2.7 eV (a wide electrochemical window) augurs well for its safe use in sodium batteries. Opening up a possibility for realizing RT operation of Na-S batteries, our prediction of a new phase in the Na-Ge-P-S system will stimulate experimental studies of the material.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

The high voltage >3.2 V predicted for this cell is verified, and its cyclability is confirmed. Operating at 180 nergy efficiency >96%, is recorded. This establishes this type of cell as an attractive candidate for energy storage. For optimum energy storage, high energy efficiency is mandated for thermal management, as well as economic reasons. The theoretical capacity of the cell is 288 Wh kg-1 (418 Wh L-1) of which 73% is realized. The cell is shown to be fail-safe against internal shorts.

Commercial and research battery technologies for electrical energy storage applications,"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Developing green energy solutions has become crucial to society. However, to develop a clean and renewable energy system, significant developments must be made, not only in energy conversion technologies (such as solar panels and wind turbines) but also regarding the feasibility and capabilities of stationary electrical energy storage (EES) systems. Many types of EES systems have been considered such as pumped hydroelectric storage (PHS), compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheels, and electrochemical storage. Among them, electrochemical storage such as battery has the advantage of being more efficient compared to other candidates, because it is more suitable in terms of the scalability, efficiency, lifetime, discharge time, and weight and/or mobility of the system. Currently, rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are the most successful portable electricity storage devices, but their use is limited to small electronic equipment. Using LIBs to store large amounts of electrical energy in stationary applications is limited, not only by performance but also by cost. Thus, a viable battery technology that can store large amounts of electrical energy in stationary applications is needed. In this review, well-developed and recent progress on the chemistry and design of batteries, as well as their effects on the electrochemical performance, is summarized and compared. In addition, the challenges that are yet to be solved and the possibilities for further improvements are explored.",Progress in Energy and Combustion Science

The electrochemical reduction of elemental sulfur has been studied in different molar ratios of the electrolyte, and aluminum tetrachloride ions have been identified at the electroactive ionic species. The Al/S battery exhibits a discharge voltage plateau of 1.1-1.2 V, with extremely high charge storage capacity of more than 1500 mAh g-1, relative to the mass of sulfur in the cathode. The energy density of the Al/S cell is estimated to be 1700 Wh kg-1 sulfur, which is competitive with the most attractive battery chemistries targeted for high-energy electrochemical storage. Characterization by means of SEM, XRD and XPS of the battery components reveal complete dissolution of sulfur-based discharge products to the electrolyte. The low cost, natural abundance and high volumetric energy density of both anode and cathode materials define a research path for new materials and cell designs for next-generation Al/S battery systems.",Journal of Power Sources
Post-lithium-ion battery chemistries for hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles,"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.Next-generation batteries designed to be the powerful successors of today's lithium-ion technology are hopefully called post-lithium systems. However, no lithium-ion cell chemistry has yet been found that is able to meet the challenges of battery electric vehicle propulsion over long distances as fossil fuels are already doing in internal combustion engines. Future visions focus completely on new approaches to meet the challenge of energy densities above 200Whkg-1. Critics complain that the target of 400Whkg-1 by the end of the decade is unrealistic. Such batteries would be five times more energy dense than the standard of the day-especially as the energy density of rechargeable batteries has risen only sixfold since the early prototypes at the beginning of the 20th century. This chapter cannot be more than a momentary overview of the state-of-the-art of leading concepts of battery technology, which might possibly be able to replace lithium-ion batteries in the next decades: metal-sulfur batteries, metal-air batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and halide batteries.",Advances in Battery Technologies for Electric Vehicles
Ambient temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Ambient- or room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries (RT Na-S) are gaining much attention as a low-cost option for large-scale electrical energy storage applications.

Towards superior volumetric performance: Design and preparation of novel carbon materials for energy storage,"© 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The volumetric performance of electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices, other than gravimetric performance, is attracting increasing attention due to the fast development of electric vehicles and smart devices. Carbon-based electrodes have advanced the fast development of EES devices while being limited by their low volumetric performance because of their porous structure and the resulting low density. This paper aims to clarify the importance of the volumetric performance and review the most recent progress in advanced EES devices with a high volumetric performance. Strategies for improving the volumetric performance, particularly with carbon-based materials, are also proposed here. The transformation of normal low-density carbons to high-density ones through the assembly of different building blocks is highlighted as a promising remedy for this issue, and their applications in next-generation EES devices (Li-S, Li-air, Na-ion, etc.) are also discussed.",Energy and Environmental Science

Roll-to-roll fabrication of organic nanorod electrodes for sodium ion batteries,"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.Organic electroactive materials derived from biomasses are promising candidates for next generation rechargeable batteries due to the low cost, sustainability and environmental benignity. Since organic materials have very low electronic conductivity, they are normally synthesized into nano-scale and mixed with conductive carbon before electrode fabrication. Herein, we first reported a unique role-to-role fabrication technology by taking advantage of the high solubility of organic materials in water. The synthetic process of nano-size organic materials is merged into the organic electrode fabrication process. 2,5-Dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone disodium salt (DHBQDS) is used as a model, and the DHBQDS nanorod electrode is in situ formed by precipitating DHBQDS nanorods from DHBQDS-sodium alginate-carbon black aqueous slurry film on a Cu current collector during electrode drying process. Due to the fast ionic and electronic conductivity of DHBQDS-carbon nanocomposite, the DHBQDS nanorod electrodes deliver a reversible capacity of 167mAhg<sup>-1</sup> at a high current density of 200mAg<sup>-1</sup> after 300 cycles, which is 87% of its initial capacity (capacity decay rate of 0.051% per cycle). To reduce the dissolution of DHBQDS in the electrolyte upon cycling, a thin layer of Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> with thickness of 1nm or 2nm is coated on the DHBQDS nanorod electrodes using atomic layer deposition (ALD). The Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> coating remarkably suppresses the dissolution of DHBQDS nanorods as evidenced by the increased Coulombic efficiency from 94% to ~100% at a low current density of 50mAg<sup>-1</sup>. The reversible capacity of Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> coated DHBQDS nanorod electrodes remains at 212mAhg<sup>-1</sup> after 300 cycles with a very low capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle. The ALD enhanced organic nanorods exhibit the best reversible capacity and cycle life among the organic electrodes reported for Na-ion batteries.",Nano Energy
Permselective graphene oxide membrane for highly stable and anti-self-discharge lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.Lithium-sulfur batteries hold great promise for serving as next generation high energy density batteries. However, the shuttle of polysulfide induces rapid capacity degradation and poor cycling stability of lithium-sulfur cells. Herein, we proposed a unique lithium-sulfur battery configuration with an ultrathin graphene oxide (GO) membrane for high stability. The oxygen electronegative atoms modified GO into a polar plane, and the carboxyl groups acted as ion-hopping sites of positively charged species (Li+) and rejected the transportation of negatively charged species (Sn2-) due to the electrostatic interactions. Such electrostatic repulsion and physical inhibition largely decreased the transference of polysulfides across the GO membrane in the lithium-sulfur system. Consequently, the GO membrane with highly tunable functionalization properties, high mechanical strength, low electric conductivity, and facile fabrication procedure is an effective permselective separator system in lithium-sulfur batteries. By the incorporation of a permselective GO membrane, the cyclic capacity decay rate is also reduced from 0.49 to 0.23%/cycle. As the GO membrane blocks the diffusion of polysulfides through the membrane, it is also with advantages of anti-self-discharge properties.",ACS Nano
Na2S-carbon nanotube fabric electrodes for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries,"© 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.A unique sodium sulfide (Na2S) cathode is developed, which will allow the use of sodium-free anodes for room-temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries. To overcome the ""inert"" nature of the Na2S, a special cathode structure is developed by spreading the multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-wrapped Na2S particles onto MWCNT fabrics. Spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses reveal a series of polysulfide intermediates involved in the charge/discharge of the cell. The Na-S battery prepared in full discharge state with the Na2S/MWCNT cathode provides a remarkable capacity of 500 A h kg-1 (based on sulfur mass) after 50 cycles.",Chemistry - A European Journal
Photovoltaic self-consumption in buildings: A review,"© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.The interest in self-consumption of PV electricity from grid-connected residential systems is increasing among PV system owners and in the scientific community. Self-consumption can be defined as the share of the total PV production directly consumed by the PV system owner. With decreased subsidies for PV electricity in several countries, increased self-consumption could raise the profit of PV systems and lower the stress on the electricity distribution grid. This review paper summarizes existing research on PV self-consumption and options to improve it. Two options for increased self-consumption are included, namely energy storage and load management, also called demand side management (DSM). Most of the papers examine PV-battery systems, sometimes combined with DSM. The results show that it is possible to increase the relative self-consumption by 13-24% points with a battery storage capacity of 0.5-1. kW. h per installed kW PV power and between 2% and 15% points with DSM, both compared to the original rate of self-consumption. The total number of papers is however rather limited and further research and more comparative studies are needed to give a comprehensive view of the technologies and their potential. Behavioral responses to PV self-consumption and the impact on the distribution grid also need to be further studied.",Applied Energy
High rate capability and superior cycle stability of a flower-like Sb2S3 anode for high-capacity sodium ion batteries,"© 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Flower-like antimony sulfide structures were prepared by a simple and easy polyol reflux process. When tested as an anode for sodium ion batteries, the material delivered a high reversible capacity of 835.3 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 after 50 cycles and maintained a capacity of 641.7 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1 after 100 cycles. Even up to 2000 mA g-1, a capacity of 553.1 mA h g-1 was obtained, indicating an excellent cycle performance and a superior rate capability. The mechanism of the formation of the micro-flowers was also investigated. The additive used facilitates the controlled release of the reactant to form uniform, shaped nanosheets and an optimum reaction time allows the nanosheets to self-assemble into micro-flowers.",Nanoscale
Electrochemical (De)lithiation of 1D sulfur chains in Li-S batteries: A model system study,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.In contrast to the extensive studies of the electrochemical behavior of conventional cyclic S8 molecules in Li-S batteries, there has been hardly any investigation of the electrochemistry of S chains. Here we use S chains encapsulated in single- and double-walled carbon nanotubes as a model system and report the electrochemical behavior of 1D S chains in Li-S batteries. An electrochemical test shows that S chains have high electrochemical activity during lithiation and extinctive electrochemistry compared with conventional S8. The confined steric effect provides Li+ solid-phase diffusion access to insert/egress reactions with S chains. During lithiation, the long S chains spontaneously become short chains, which show higher discharge plateaus and better kinetics. The unique electrochemistry of S chains supplements the existing knowledge of the S cathode mechanism and provides avenues for rational design of S cathode materials in Li-S batteries.",Journal of the American Chemical Society
Use of ion-selective polymer membranes for an aqueous electrolyte rechargeable Li-ion-polysulphide battery,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.Aqueous electrolyte Li-ion-polysulphide batteries offer great promise due to the use of low-cost and abundant raw materials. Following up on our previous studies in which we explored a totally new practical battery chemistry coupling a well-known cathode material in Li-ion batteries (i.e. LiMn2O4) with a dissolved polysulphide anode, herein we aim to further develop the system by replacing the ceramic membrane with an ion-selective polymer membrane, allowing cost-effective and higher energy density options. After tuning the osmotic movements inside the membrane, dissolved polysulphide leakage from one compartment to another is successfully eliminated. With the additional use of porous silica serving as an absorbent for sulphur-based gaseous products, a 1.5 V average voltage together with a stable cycling profile over 200 cycles at high current density regimes are easily achieved.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Au-embedded ZnO/NiO hybrid with excellent electrochemical performance as advanced electrode materials for supercapacitor,"© 2015 American Chemical Society.Here we design a nanostructure by embedding Au nanoparticles into ZnO/NiO core-shell composites as supercapacitors electrodes materials. This optimized hybrid electrodes exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance including a long-term cycling stability and a maximum specific areal capacitance of 4.1 F/cm2 at a current density of 5 mA/cm2, which is much higher than that of ZnO/NiO hierarchical materials (0.5 F/cm2). Such an enhanced property is attributed to the increased electro-electrolyte interfaces, short electron diffusion pathways and good electrical conductivity. Apart from this, electrons can be temporarily trapped and accumulated at the Fermi level (EF) because of the localized schottky barrier at Au/NiO interface in charge process until fill the gap between ZnO and NiO, so that additional electrons can be released during discharge. These results demonstrate that suitable interface engineering may open up new opportunities in the development of high-performance supercapacitors.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces
Effect of ionic size on solvate stability of glyme-based solvate ionic liquids,"© 2014 American Chemical Society.A series of binary mixtures composed of glymes (triglyme, G3; tetraglyme, G4; pentaglyme, G5) and alkali-metal bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide salts (M[TFSA]; M = Li, Na, and K) were prepared, and the correlation between the composition and solvate stability was systematically investigated. Their phase diagrams and Raman spectra suggested complexation of the glymes with M[TFSA] in 1:1 and/or 2:1 molar ratio(s). From isothermal stability measurements, it was found that the formation of structurally stable complexes in the solid state did not necessarily ensure their thermal stability in the liquid state, especially in the case of 2:1 complexes, where uncoordinating or highly exchangeable glyme ligands existed in the molten complexes. The phase-state-dependent Raman spectra also supported the presence of free glymes in certain liquid complexes. The effect of the electric field induced by the alkali-metal cations on the oxidative stability of certain glyme complexes was examined by linear sweep voltammetry and quantum chemical calculations. Although the actual oxidative stability of complexes did not necessarily reflect the calculated HOMO energy levels of the glymes, the strong electric field induced by the smaller M+ cations and proper coordination structures impart high stability to the glyme complexes. The results of thermogravimetry of complexes with different M+ cations revealed that a balance of competitive interactions of the M+ ions with the glymes and [TFSA]- anions predominates the thermal stability.

"Exfoliated-SnS2 restacked on graphene as a high-capacity, high-rate, and long-cycle life anode for sodium ion batteries","© 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Designed as a high-capacity, high-rate, and long-cycle life anode for sodium ion batteries, exfoliated-SnS2 restacked on graphene is prepared by the hydrolysis of lithiated SnS2 followed by a facile hydrothermal method. Structural and morphological characterizations demonstrate that ultrasmall SnS2 nanoplates (with a typical size of 20-50 nm) composed of 2-5 layers are homogeneously decorated on the surface of graphene, while the hybrid structure self-assembles into a three-dimensional (3D) network architecture. The obtained SnS2/graphene nanocomposite delivers a remarkable capacity as high as 650 mA h g-1 at a current density of 200 mA g-1. More impressively, the capacity can reach 326 mA h g-1 even at 4000 mA g-1 and remains stable at ∼610 mA h g-1 without fading up to 300 cycles when the rate is brought back to 200 mA g-1. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergetic effects between the ultrasmall SnS2 and the highly conductive graphene network. The unique structure can simultaneously facilitate Na+ ion diffusion, provide more reaction sites, and suppress aggregation and volume fluctuation of the active materials during prolonged cycling.",Nanoscale

Ultrasmall Sn nanoparticles embedded in carbon as high-performance anode for sodium-ion batteries,"© 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.Designed as a high-capacity, high-rate, and long-cycle life anode for sodium-ion batteries, ultrasmall Sn nanoparticles (≈8 nm) homogeneously embedded in spherical carbon network (denoted as 8-Sn@C) is prepared using an aerosol spray pyrolysis method. Instrumental analyses show that 8-Sn@C nanocomposite with 46 wt% Sn and a BET surface area of 150.43 m2 g-1 delivers an initial reversible capacity of ≈493.6 mA h g-1 at the current density of 200 mA g-1, a high-rate capacity of 349 mA h g-1 even at 4000 mA g-1, and a stable capacity of ≈415 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The remarkable electrochemical performance of 8-Sn@C is owing to the synergetic effects between the well-dispersed ultrasmall Sn nanoparticles and the conductive carbon network. This unique structure of very-fine Sn nanoparticles embedded in the porous carbon network can effectively suppress the volume fl uctuation and particle aggregation of tin during prolonged sodiation/desodiation process, thus solving the major problems of pulverization, loss of electrical contact and low utilization rate facing Sn anode.",Advanced Functional Materials

Dynamic modeling of the reaction mechanism in a Li/O2 cell: Influence of a redox mediator,"© 2015 The Electrochemical Society.Lithium-oxygen cells with organic electrolyte suffer high overpotentials during charge, indicating asymmetric charge/discharge reaction mechanisms. We present a multi-physics dynamic modeling and simulation study of the Li/O2 cell cycling behavior. We present three different multi-step mechanisms of the 2 Li + O2 ⇄ Li2O2 cell reaction, (A) a reversible 5-step mechanism, (B) a partially irreversible 6-step mechanism, and (C) a partially irreversible 8-step mechanism that includes reactions of a redox mediator. Model predictions are compared to experimental galvanostatic cycling data of Swagelok cells without and with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) as redox mediator. All mechanisms are able to predict the discharge behavior in good agreement to the experimental results. The experimentally observed high charge overpotentials as well as their reduction by using a redox mediator can be qualitatively reproduced with the irreversible reaction mechanisms. However, the particular shape of the experimental charge curve with continuously increasing charge overpotential cannot be reproduced with the present mechanisms.",ECS Transactions

Rechargeable batteries: Grasping for the limits of chemistry,"© 2015 The Electrochemical Society.The demand for rechargeable batteries with high gravimetric and volumetric energy density will continue to grow due to the rapidly increasing integration of renewable energy into the global energy scheme. In terms of energy density, modern high-end rechargeable-battery technology is reaching its fundamental limits and no big advancement leaps in this field are expected. The energy-cost model, developed for comparative evaluation of battery cell chemistries in a commercial type pouch cell configuration, helps us to find the relationship between cost and energy density, enabling the prediction of the most promising material combinations for near-future non-aqueous rechargeable batteries for portable electronics and automotive applications. Among the wide variety of positive electrode materials only few show enough potential for commercialization, and, clearly, the immediate future will still be dominated by Li-ion technology, with Li-rich and Ni-rich materials as definite winners, and with Li-S and Na-ion emerging as contestants due to low cost and abundance of their key components. As further significant improvements in gravimetric/volumetric energy density and cost cannot be achieved through new battery chemistries, then the engineering, targeting cost reduction and safety assurance, will most likely be the main driving force behind future rechargeable battery development.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
"Synthesis, extrusion processing and ionic conductivity measurements of sodium β-alumina tubes","Pure and Li-doped sodium β-alumina (NaMg0.67Al10.33O17) ceramics were prepared from the stoichiometric mixture of raw powders. Pellets and tubes were formed from the precursor (NBA-1S) and preformed sodium β-alumina powder through compaction and extrusion processing, respectively. The obtained specimens were finally sintered to dense ceramics. The ceramics were comparatively evaluated for their density, microstructure, phase formation and electrical properties. Both tubes and pellets processed with the preformed sodium β-alumina powder (NBA-2S) showed enhanced densification along with relatively better phase purity and crystallinity. The ceramics prepared from the preformed powder exhibited higher density of 94-95% TD (theoretical densities) in comparison to the ceramics processed from the raw mixture (NBA-1S) with a density of 85-87%TD, which are complemented well through fractographs and microstructures. The ceramics processed using the preformed sodium β-alumina (NBA-2S) also exhibited high room temperature AC conductivity of 1.77×10-4 S/cm (1MHz) with an increasing trend with temperature. The higher ionic conductivity at all temperatures in NBA-2S than in NBA-1S ceramics can be attributed to the relatively high phase purity, crystallinity and higher density values of NBA-2S ceramics.",Processing and Application of Ceramics
Sodiated carbon: A reversible anode for sodium-oxygen batteries and route for the chemical synthesis of sodium superoxide (NaO2),"© 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The common cell design of sodium/oxygen batteries is based on an alkali metal as the negative electrode and a carbon gas diffusion layer (GDL) as the positive (oxygen) electrode. The use of sodium metal anodes maximizes the energy capacity, but on the other hand induces undesired and often unpredictable side reactions that complicate investigations on the oxygen electrode and the overall cell chemistry. Therefore we demonstrate the function of a sodium-ion/oxygen battery by replacing sodium metal with a sodiated carbon electrode that is able to reversibly store up to q = 125 mA h g-1. We use a symmetric ""all GDL"" arrangement, i.e. the same carbon gas diffusion layer is used as the positive and negative electrode. Overall, this approach increases the cycle life by a factor of 5 and further decreases the sum of the charge and discharge overpotentials (η = 150 mV @ j = 200 μA cm-2), proving that current limitations of the sodium-oxygen battery are mainly determined by the metal anode rather than by the oxygen cathode. We find that sodium storage in the GDL proceeds by at least two different mechanisms which can be distinguished by their different chemical stabilities against oxygen and water. Another important finding is that NaO2 can be also synthesized chemically (rather than electrochemically) under ambient conditions from sodiated carbon and gaseous oxygen-which is interesting with respect to the competition between NaO2 and Na2O2 as discharge products.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Enhanced electrochemical performance of a lead-acid battery by a surface modified negative grid with multiwall carbon nanotube coating,"© 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.High-performance lead-acid battery (LAB) negative grids have been prepared using a simple carbon nanotube (CNT) coating method. To assess the properties of these materials for use in LAB systems, galvanostatic charging-discharging measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were performed. The morphology and chemical composition of the CNT coating on the negative grid have been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) characterization. The results clearly demonstrate that the CNT coating is uniform and fully covers the negative grid of the LAB, which acts as a CNT adhesion layer (CNTAL) between the current collector and the negative active materials (NAMs), and improves the electrical conductivity. Moreover, an enhanced charge acceptance, and excellent electrochemical performance and cycling stability have been observed for these CNT coated electrodes in comparison to the uncoated electrode. The obtained results reveal that the CNT coating not only reduces the charge transfer resistance but also protects the NAM from irreversible lead sulfation.",RSC Advances
From lithium to sodium: Cell chemistry of room temperature sodium-air and sodium-sulfur batteries,"Research devoted to room temperature lithium-sulfur (Li/S8) and lithium-oxygen (Li/O2) batteries has significantly increased over the past ten years. The race to develop such cell systems is mainly motivated by the very high theoretical energy density and the abundance of sulfur and oxygen. The cell chemistry, however, is complex, and progress toward practical device development remains hampered by some fundamental key issues, which are currently being tackled by numerous approaches. Quite surprisingly, not much is known about the analogous sodium-based battery systems, although the already commercialized, high-temperature Na/S8 and Na/NiCl2 batteries suggest that a rechargeable battery based on sodium is feasible on a large scale. Moreover, the natural abundance of sodium is an attractive benefit for the development of batteries based on low cost components. This review provides a summary of the state-of-the-art knowledge on lithium-sulfur and lithium-oxygen batteries and a direct comparison with the analogous sodium systems. The general properties, major benefits and challenges, recent strategies for performance improvements and general guidelines for further development are summarized and critically discussed. In general, the substitution of lithium for sodium has a strong impact on the overall properties of the cell reaction and differences in ion transport, phase stability, electrode potential, energy density, etc. can be thus expected. Whether these differences will benefit a more reversible cell chemistry is still an open question, but some of the first reports on room temperature Na/S8 and Na/O2 cells already show some exciting differences as compared to the established Li/S8 and Li/O2 systems.",Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology
Towards greener and more sustainable batteries for electrical energy storage,"© 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It is therefore essential to incorporate material abundance, eco-efficient synthetic processes and life-cycle analysis into the design of new electrochemical storage systems. At present, a few existing technologies address these issues, but in each case, fundamental and technological hurdles remain to be overcome. Here we provide an overview of the current state of energy storage from a sustainability perspective. We introduce the notion of sustainability through discussion of the energy and environmental costs of state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, considering elemental abundance, toxicity, synthetic methods and scalability. With the same themes in mind, we also highlight current and future electrochemical storage systems beyond lithium-ion batteries.

Elemental Selenium for Electrochemical Energy Storage,"© 2014 American Chemical Society.To meet the increasing demand for electrochemical energy storage with high energy density, elemental Se is proposed as a new attractive candidate with high volumetric capacity density similar to that of S. Se is chemically and electrochemically analogous to S to a large extent but is saliently featured owing to its semiconductivity, compatibility with carbonate-based electrolytes, and activity with a Na anode. Despite only short-term studies, many advanced Se-based electrode materials have been developed for rechargeable Li batteries, Na batteries, and Li ion batteries. In this Perspective, we review the advances in Se-based energy storage materials and the challenges of Li-Se battery in both carbonate-based and ether-based electrolytes.

It exhibits high safety, good mechanical properties and good electrochemical stability. The gel polymer electrolyte provides the sodium ionic conductivity of 0.60 mS cm- 1 at ambient temperature, while the commercial separator (Celgard 2730) offers only 0.16 mS cm- 1. The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity from 25 to 75 °C is consistent with an Arrhenius-behavior. The ionic transference number of sodium ion (tNa+) in the gel polymer electrolyte is 0.30, higher than that (0.17) in the commercial separator. This provides a new direction to improve the safety of sodium ion batteries.",Solid State Ionics
Advanced intermediate temperature sodium copper chloride battery,"© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Sodium metal chloride batteries, also called as ZEBRA batteries, possess many merits such as low cost, high energy density and high safety, but their high operation temperature (270-350 °C) may cause several issues and limit their applications. Therefore, decreasing the operation temperature is of great importance in order to broaden their usage. Using a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) catholyte composed of sodium chloride buffered 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride-aluminum chloride and a dense β″-aluminates solid electrolyte film with 500 micron thickness, we report an intermediate temperature sodium copper chloride battery which can be operated at only 150°C, therefore alleviating the corrosion issues, improving the material compatibilities and reducing the operating complexities associated with the conventional ZEBRA batteries. The RTIL presents a high ionic conductivity (0.247 S cm-1) at 150°C and a wide electrochemical window (-2.6 to 2.18 vs. Al3+/Al). With the discharge plateau at 2.64 V toward sodium and the specific capacity of 285 mAh g-1, this intermediate temperature battery exhibits an energy density (750 mWh g-1) comparable to the conventional ZEBRA batteries (728-785 mWh g-1) and superior to commercialized Li-ion batteries (550-680 mWh g-1), making it very attractive for renewable energy integration and other grid related applications.",Journal of Power Sources

This method provided highly dispersed sulphur within a well contacted carbon material. A remarkable high specific capacity of about 734 A h kg−1 (for a sulphur content of 45 wt %, a 100% sulphur compound with a specific capacity of 1630 A h kg−1), a very high electrochemical stability (about 90% remaining discharge capacity after about 200 cycles), and significantly improved discharge power rating characterize the novel sulphur compounds for room temperature operated Na/S batteries.",Russian Journal of Electrochemistry
First-principles study on structural and electronic properties of α-S and Na-S crystals,"© 2014 The Physical Society of Japan.Several Na-S solid phases have been considered to be produced in low-temperature Na/S batteries during charge- discharge reactions. We study structural and electronic properties of α-S and Na2Sx(x = 1, 2, 4, and 5) crystals using first-principles calculations. Calculated structural properties are in good agreement with experiments, and the van der Waals interactions have an essential role on the cohesive properties in α-S. The results of energetics and electronic structures show that all the calculated Na-S crystal phases are insulating and are stable relative to the elemental Na and S phases. We estimate voltage curves as a function of the Na concentration in the S-cathode of all-solid Na/S batteries, showing mainly three voltage regions at 2.09-2.11, 1.79, and 1.68V corresponding to the formations of Na2S5and Na2S4, Na2S2, and Na2S, respectively, for the assumed four-step reactions on the basis of the phase diagram.",Journal of the Physical Society of Japan
Lithium ion conduction and ion-polymer interaction in PVdF-HFP based gel polymer electrolytes,"© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.The GPE films consisting of PVdF-HFP as host polymer, LiCF3SO3 as dopant salt and the mixture of EC and PC as plasticizing solvent were prepared by the solution casting technique. The ionic conductivity at room temperature and the conductivity-temperature dependence were determined by a.c impedance spectroscopy. The result of conductivity versus temperature obeys the VTF rule. The increase in the conductivity is due to the increase in the number of mobile charge carriers and the decrease in ion pairs and ion aggregates as revealed by the FTIR spectra.

Research development on sodium-ion batteries,"The material's abundance is a simple and clear reason as to why sodium ions are attractive as charge carriers for rechargeable batteries. It is also expected that potassium ions have a further smaller desolvation energy compared with the Li and Na systems in aprotic solvents. However, further energy sacrifice is also unavoidable for the potassium system due to heavy atomic weight. In addition to the oxides, a wide variety of crystal structures is known for polyanionic compounds and the structural chemistry of the Na system is much more complicated in comparison to the Li system. Na ions are apparently coordinated by four fluoride ions at bottleneck sites when the Na ions migrate across the perovskite-type framework structure.",Chemical Reviews
Structure and properties of the Na2S-P2S5 glasses and glass-ceramics prepared by mechanical milling,"The xNa2S·(100 - x)P2S5 (mol%; x = 67, 70, 75 and 80) glasses were prepared by mechanochemical processing. Composition dependence of local structure, thermal behavior and electrical conductivity of the prepared glasses were examined. NMR and Raman spectroscopic studies revealed that the xNa2S·(100 - x)P2S 5 glasses were composed of the thiophosphate units corresponding to their nominal compositions. The room temperature conductivities of the glasses increased with an increase in the Na2S content and attained a maximum at the x = 80 composition; the highest conductivity is 1 × 10 -5 S cm-1. The xNa2S·(100 - x)P 2S5 glass-ceramics were obtained by heating the glasses beyond their crystallization temperatures. The relationship between conductivity and crystalline phase was studied for the glass-ceramics. The glass-ceramics at the compositions of x = 70 and 75 exhibited higher conductivities than those of corresponding glasses due to the precipitation of the superionic cubic Na 3PS4 crystal. In particular, the x = 75 glass-ceramic showed the highest conductivity of 2 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 25 °C and the lowest activation energy of 27 kJ mol-1. In addition, the x = 75 glass-ceramic was electrochemically stable against sodium deposition and dissolution.

Na[FSA]-[C3C1pyrr][FSA] ionic liquids as electrolytes for sodium secondary batteries: Effects of Na ion concentration and operation temperature,"As electrolytes for sodium secondary batteries operating over a wide temperature range, Na[FSA]-[C3C1pyrr][FSA] (FSA = bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide, C3C1pyrr = N-methyl-N- propylpyrrolidinium) ionic liquids have been investigated. The effects of Na ion concentration (0-60 mol% Na[FSA]) and operation temperature (253-363 K) on the viscosity and ionic conductivity and charge-discharge performance of Na/Na[FSA]-[C3C1pyrr][FSA]/NaCrO2 cells are studied. Results show that Na ion concentration strongly affects the rate capability of the cells, and that the best rate capability at 363 K is obtained at 40 mol% Na[FSA]. The operation temperature also significantly influences the charge-discharge performance, especially at low temperatures. At operation temperatures below 273 K, 25 mol% Na[FSA] is found to be the optimum Na ion concentration.

Strength analysis of β″-Al2O3 ceramics tubes for energy storage sodium sulfur batteries,"©, 2014, Harbin Institute of Technology. All right reserved.Aiming at the problem of easy failure of the β ″-Al2O3 ceramic tube which is the core component of energy storage sodium sulfur battery, the mathematical model of ceramic tubes was built by using cylindrical shell theory, and the solid model and the numerical simulation were carried out by using ANSYS software. The quantitative relationships among the wall thickness, the diameter, the length for the ceramic tube and its mechanical strength were given. The results indicate that the maximum stress is located at the root of ceramic tubes, and increases with the decrease of the wall thickness or the increase of the diameter, but it is almost independent of the length, and the critical curve between the wall thickness and the diameter for ceramic tubes almost presents the linear trend, which provides quantitative guidance for optimal design of mechanical strength for ceramic tubes.",Cailiao Kexue yu Gongyi/Material Science and Technology

X-ray diffraction measurements and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the c-axis of the β″-alumina grains oriented along the direction of pressure application during SPS. Na volatilization was well suppressed by encapsulation in a carbon die and a short sintering time. Higher ionic conductivity was observed along the vertical direction than along the direction of pressure application owing to the alignment of the conduction plane in β″-alumina crystals.

"Functional, water-soluble binders for improved capacity and stability of lithium-sulfur batteries","Binders based on mixtures of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) are here shown to significantly improve the reversible capacity and capacity retention of lithium- sulfur batteries compared to conventional binders. This mixed binder formulation combines the local improvement to the solvent system offered by PEO and the lithium (poly)sulfide-stabilising effect of PVP. Cells with cathodes made of simple mixtures of sulfur powder and carbon black with a binder of 4:1 PEO:PVP exhibited a reversible capacity of over 1000 mAh g-1 at C/5 after 50 cycles and 800 mAh g-1 at 1C after 200 cycles.

Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries with liquid-phase sodium polysulfide catholytes and binder-free multiwall carbon nanotube fabric electrodes,"© 2014 American Chemical Society.Charge/discharge of a room-temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) battery involves redox processes of a series of long-chain soluble sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8). By taking advantage of this, a room-temperature Na-S battery is developed with dissolved sodium polysulfide catholyte and a free-standing, binder-free multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) fabric electrode. Use of liquid-phase sodium polysulfide as a cathode not only provides a facile dispersion and homogeneous distribution of the sulfur active material into the conductive matrix but also supplies a unique approach to mechanistically understand the ambient-temperature Na-S battery system. With the intermediate products (polysulfides) as the starting cathode, the electrochemical characteristics of the Na-S battery in the lower-voltage-plateau region can be readily studied without the impact from the transformation process of elemental sulfur into long-chain sodium polysulfides. The nanostructured, free-standing MWCNT fabric electrode in this battery system acts as a high-surface current collector. In comparison with the traditional solid sulfur-carbon composite cathode, the sodium polysulfide/MWCNT fabric cathode provides higher active-material utilization and capacity retention during cycling. Electrochemical studies reveal that the transition of the low-ordered sodium polysulfides (or disulfide) is mostly responsible for the capacity fade during cycling. Operation of the cells with the sulfur/dissolved sodium polysulfide redox couple provides a stable output capacity/energy.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Influence of the porosity degree of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co- hexafluoropropylene) separators in the performance of Li-ion batteries,"Polyvinylidenedifluoride-hexafluoropropylene, (P(VdF-HFP))-based polymer electrolytes, as separators for lithium batteries, were prepared through different polymer/solvent (N,N-dimethylformamide, DMF) ratios and physicochemically investigated. Scanning electron microscopy measurements have shown a homogeneously distributed porosity within the membranes, with moderately tortuous pathways, resulting in a liquid uptake up to 77 wt.% with respect to the overall weight and conduction values above 10-3 S cm-1 at room temperature. Prolonged cycling tests, performed on Li/Sn-C and Li/LiFePO4 half-cells based on P(VdF-HFP) polymer electrolyte separator membranes, have evidenced nominal capacities ranging from 70% to 90% of the theoretical value with very good capacity retention and charge/discharge efficiency close at 100% even at high current rates. A capacity decay is observed at high current regime, associated to the diffusion phenomena occurring within the electrode and the polymer electrolyte separator membrane. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Potassium-sulfur batteries: A new member of room-temperature rechargeable metal-sulfur batteries,"We report room-temperature rechargeable potassium-sulfur (K-S) batteries using ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3)/sulfur and polyanilime (PANI) coated CMK-3/sulfur composites as the cathode and metallic potassium as the anode. The electrochemical reaction mechanism was investigated by electrochemical tests, TEM, XRD, and Raman spectra. It was found that K-S batteries delivered two reduction peaks located at about 2.1 and 1.8 V and one oxidation peak at about 2.2 V, respectively. Meanwhile, K2S3 was the major discharge product that could be charged to reversibly form S and K ion. Through optimization of sulfur content, the CMK-3/sulfur composite with 40.8 wt % S displayed an initial discharge capacity of 512.7 mAh g-1 and a capacity of 202.3 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g-1. A coating of conductive polyanilime (PANI) on the CMK-3/sulfur composite is effective in enhancing the cycling performance.

The maximum span in the sodion migration of β''-phase (2.4283 Å) is only about a third of that for the β''-phase (6.9037 Å), so the β''-phase has higher ionic conductivity than the β-phase.",Jiegou Huaxue
The new electrochemical reaction mechanism of Na/FeS2 cell at ambient temperature,FeS2 synthesized by hydrothermal method was used for sodium batteries for the first time. A large initial discharge capacity of 771 mAh g-1 and a high reversible capacity of 521 mAh g-1 were obtained. The reaction mechanism of electrochemical de-sodiation (charge) was investigated after the initial discharge. Our results have demonstrated that the composition and structure of electrode after the charging to 3.0 V could not recover its original state of FeS2 and a new phase of NaFeS 2 was revealed. This should be responsible to the large irreversible capacity in the first cycle and the high discharge and charge plateaus after the initial cycle. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Recent research progress on iron- and manganese-based positive electrode materials for rechargeable sodium batteries,"Large-scale high-energy batteries with electrode materials made from the Earth-abundant elements are needed to achieve sustainable energy development. On the basis of material abundance, rechargeable sodium batteries with iron- and manganese-based positive electrode materials are the ideal candidates for large-scale batteries. In this review, iron- and manganese-based electrode materials, oxides, phosphates, fluorides, etc, as positive electrodes for rechargeable sodium batteries are reviewed. Iron and manganese compounds with sodium ions provide high structural flexibility. Two layered polymorphs, O3- and P2-type layered structures, show different electrode performance in Na cells related to the different phase transition and sodium migration processes on sodium extraction/insertion.

Review of carbon materials for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries,"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are extensively used in numerous portable devices such as smart-phones and laptops. However, current LIBs based on the conventional intercalation mechanism cannot meet the requirements of the electronics industry and electric vehicles although they are approaching their theoretical capacity. Therefore, it is extremely urgent to seek for systems with higher energy densities. Among various promising candidates, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with a high theoretical capacity are very attractive. However, the commercial use of Li-S batteries still faces obstacles such as the low electrical conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide and the dissolution of polysulfides. The introduction of nanocarbon materials into Li-S batteries sheds light on the efficient utilization of sulfur by improving the conductivity of the composites and restraining the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Here, we give a brief review of recent progress on carbon/sulfur composites, especially carbon nanotube-, graphene-and porous carbon-based hybrids, new insights on the relationships between the structure and the electrochemical performance, and propose some important aspects for the future development of Li-S batteries.",Xinxing Tan Cailiao/New Carbon Materials

Liquid-metal electrode to enable ultra-low temperature sodium-beta alumina batteries for renewable energy storage,"Commercial sodium-sulphur or sodium-metal halide batteries typically need an operating temperature of 300-350°C, and one of the reasons is poor wettability of liquid sodium on the surface of beta alumina. Here we report an alloying strategy that can markedly improve the wetting, which allows the batteries to be operated at much lower temperatures. Our combined experimental and computational studies suggest that addition of caesium to sodium can markedly enhance the wettability. Single cells with Na-Cs alloy anodes exhibit great improvement in cycling life over those with pure sodium anodes at 175 and 150°C. The cells show good performance even at as low as 95°C. These results demonstrate that sodium-beta alumina batteries can be operated at much lower temperatures with successfully solving the wetting issue. This work also suggests a strategy to use liquid metals in advanced batteries that can avoid the intrinsic safety issues associated with dendrite formation. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Systematical electrochemical study on the parasitic shuttle-effect in lithium-sulfur-cells at different temperatures and different rates,"The influence of cycling rate and temperature on the performance of lithium sulfur batteries is systematically studied by evaluating data of hundred identical cells. Differences in the discharge and charge capacities and the voltage profiles during the first and subsequent cycles are evaluated quantitatively in detail. Special attention is paid to the parasitic shuttle effect and its magnitude as function of C-rate and temperature. Mathematical models by Kumaresan et al. and Mikhaylik et al. are used to discuss the correlation between discharge/charge capacities, cycling efficiency and cycling rate at different temperatures. Mathematical error analysis further provides information on typical deviations between identical samples that can be expected when characterizing Li/S cells. This error can become significant especially when reaching higher cycle numbers. When changing the cycling parameters we find that the different regions of the voltage profile are affected differently. Therefore, we conducted first galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements on the Li/S cell system to study the kinetics during cell cycling and evaluated the relaxation behavior between the different states of discharge/charge and OCV conditions. Significant differences in relaxation kinetics are found for the lower and higher plateaus of the discharge- and charge voltage profiles. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Physicochemical properties of pentaglyme-sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide solvate ionic liquid,"The physicochemical properties of pentaglyme (G5) and sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (Na[TFSA]) binary mixtures were investigated with respect to salt concentration and temperature. The density, viscosity, ionic conductivity, self-diffusion coefficient, and oxidative stability of a series of binary mixtures were measured, and the mixtures were examined as electrolytes for Na secondary batteries. An equimolar mixture of G5 and Na[TFSA] formed a low melting solvate, [Na(G5)1][TFSA], which exhibited an ionic conductivity of 0.61 mS cm-1 at 30 °C. The ionicity (Λimp/Λideal) of the glyme-Na[TFSA] mixture was estimated from the molar conductivity of electrochemical impedance measurements (Λimp) and the Walden plot (Λ ideal). [Na(G5)1][TFSA] possessed a high ionicity of 0.63 at 30 °C, suggesting that [Na(G5)1][TFSA] is highly dissociated into a [Na(G5)1]+ cation and a [TFSA]- anion, regardless of the extreme salt concentration in the liquid. The oxidative stabilities of G5-Na[TFSA] mixtures were investigated by linear sweep voltammetry, and the higher concentration resulted in higher oxidative stability due to the lowering of the HOMO energy level of G5 by complexation with the Na+ ion. In addition, battery tests were performed using the mixtures as electrolytes. The [Na|[Na(G5)1][TFSA]|Na0.44MnO 2] cell showed good charge-discharge cycle stability, with a discharge capacity of ca. 100 mA h g-1, while the [Na(G5) 1.25][TFSA] system, containing excess G5, showed poor stability. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics

Highly reversible room-temperature sulfur/long-chain sodium polysulfide batteries,"In a room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery, the complicated reduction reaction of the sulfur cathode generally involves two main steps: (i) transformation of elemental sulfur into long-chain soluble sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn 4 ≥ n ≥ 8) and (ii) conversion of the long-chain sodium polysulfides into solid-state short-chain polysulfide Na 2S2 or disulfide Na2S. It is found that the slow kinetics of the second step limits the efficiency of discharge and induces irreversible capacity loss during cycling. Accordingly, we present here a RT Na-S cell operated with the sulfur/long-chain sodium polysulfide redox couple to avoid the capacity fade. An advanced cathode structure has been developed by inserting a carbon nanofoam interlayer between the sulfur cathode and the separator to localize the soluble polysulfide species and prevent its migration to the anode.

"Structure and dynamics in an organic ionic plastic crystal, N-ethyl-N-methyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) amide, mixed with a sodium salt","We present for the first time, the solid state phase behaviour of the organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) N-methyl-N-ethyl-pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide, [C2mpyr][NTf2], upon mixing with the sodium salt, Na[NTf2]. Whereas the behaviour of OIPCs mixed with lithium salts has been well established, the influence of adding a sodium salt has not previously been reported. The phase diagram is presented for Na[NTf2] compositions between 1 and 50 mol%, and shows a eutectic composition at 15 mol% with a eutectic temperature at 63 °C. In contrast to the lithium doping of the same OIPC, the conductivity does not increase significantly at, or below room temperature, however the material containing 40 mol% Na[NTf2] has an ionic conductivity of 10-4 S cm -1 in the solid state at 60 °C, which is more than 3 orders of magnitude higher than the pure OIPC. Synchrotron XRD, solid-state NMR and SEM all indicate the presence of two distinct phases across all of the compositions studied. One phase is identical to that of the pure [C2mpyr][NTf 2] and the other phase is a mixed cation compound, quite distinct from the pure Na[NTf2] material. The higher eutectic temperature (63 °C) in the sodium based system compared to lithium (30 °C) leads to purely solid state conductivity over the entire composition range up to 63 °C. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A

Electrochemical stability of non-aqueous electrolytes for sodium-ion batteries and their compatibility with Na0.7CoO2,"The present study compares the physico-chemical properties of non-aqueous liquid electrolytes based on NaPF6, NaClO4 and NaCF 3SO3 salts in the binary mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The ionic conductivity of the electrolytes is determined as a function of salt concentration and temperature. It is found that the electrolytes containing NaClO4 and NaPF6 exhibit ionic conductivities ranging from 5 mS cm-1 to 7 mS cm-1 at ambient temperature. The electrochemical stability window of the different electrolytes is studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements with respect to a variety of working electrodes (WE) such as glassy carbon (GC), graphite and a carbon gas diffusion layer (GDL). Electrolytes containing NaPF6 and NaClO4 are found to be electrochemically stable with respect to GC and GDL electrodes up to 4.5 V vs. Na/Na+, with some side reactions starting from around 3.0 V for the latter salt. The results further show that aluminium is preferred over different steels as a cathode current collector. Copper is stable up to a potential of 3.5 V vs. Na/Na+. In view of practical Na-ion battery systems, the electrolytes are electrochemically tested with Na0.7CoO2 as a positive electrode.

Ion conduction and phase morphology in sulfonate copolymer ionomers based on ionic liquid-sodium cation mixtures,"A series of sulfonate based copolymer ionomers based on a combination of ionic liquid and sodium cations have been prepared in different ratios. This system was designed to improve the ionic conductivity of ionomers by partially replacing sodium cations with bulky cations that are less associated with anion centres on the polymer backbone. This provides more conduction sites for sodium to 'hop' to in the ionomers. Characterization showed the glass transition and 15N chemical shift of the ionomers did not vary significantly as the amount of Na+ varied, while the ionic conductivity increased with decreasing Na+ content, indicating conductivity is increasingly decoupled from Tg. Optical microscope images showed phase separation in all compositions, which indicated the samples were inhomogeneous. The introduction of low molecular weight plasticizer (PEG) reduced the Tg and increased the ionic conductivity significantly. The inclusion of PEG also led to a more homogeneous material. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Journal of Materials Chemistry A
Pitfalls in the characterization of sulfur/carbon nanocomposite materials for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.The preparation of sulfur/carbon composite materials for lithium-sulfur batteries is currently a very active research field. Thereto, nanoporous carbon materials are mixed with or infiltrated by sulfur to provide a close contact between both compounds. The characterization of these often complex and on the nanoscale structured composite materials is usually done by vacuum based methods such as nitrogen physisorption or scanning electron microscopy, for example. In this study we show that results from these measurements can be misinterpreted. The reason is the volatility of sulfur that leads to a rapid migration and continuous redistribution effects, especially at low pressures and/or elevated temperatures. For nitrogen physisorption this means that virtually identical isotherms are found for S8/C samples, irrespective of their pre-treatment, making it impossible to prove intentional nanostructuring by pore filling. Similar effects are found for scanning electron microscopy studies where sulfur migration and contamination of originally sulfur free samples is evidenced in situ. Further evidence is provided by macroscopic experiments combined with elementary analysis. The results show that characterizing the structure of S8/C composite materials or electrodes is very challenging. In addition, the observed rapid sulfur redistribution might also have important consequences for the performance of practical lithium-sulfur batteries.",Carbon
Perfluorinated ionomer-enveloped sulfur cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.Nafion is known to suppress the polysulfide (PS) shuttle effect, a major obstacle to achieving high capacity and long cycle life for lithium-sulfur batteries. However, elaborate control of the layer's configuration is required for high performance. In this regard, we designed a Nafion-enveloped sulfur cathode, where the Nafion layer is formed on the skin of the cathode, covering its surface and edge while not restricting the porosity. Discharge capacity and efficiency were enhanced with the enveloping configuration, demonstrating suppression of shuttle. The edge protection exhibited better cycling stability than an edge-open configuration. In the absence of the Nafion envelope, charged sulfur concentrated on the top region of the cathode because of the relatively lower PS concentration at the cathode surface. Surprisingly, for the Nafion-enveloped cathode, sulfur was evenly distributed along the cathode, indicating that the configuration imparts a uniform PS concentration within the cathode.",ChemSusChem
Preparation and characterization of highly sodium ion conducting Na 3PS4-Na4SiS4 solid electrolytes,"This study investigated electrical and electrochemical properties of (100 - x)Na3PS4·xNa4SiS4 (mol%) glass-ceramics prepared using mechanical milling and consecutive heat treatment. Glass-ceramics at the compositions of 0 ≤ x ≤ 10 exhibited higher conductivity than 10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature, which was achieved by precipitation of cubic Na3PS4 crystal with high sodium ion conductivity. The conductivity increased concomitantly with increasing Na4SiS4 contents at compositions of 0 ≤ x ≤ 6. The glass-ceramic with 6 mol% Na4SiS4 exhibited conductivity of 7.4 × 10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature, which is the highest value reported for Na+ ion conducting sulfides to date. The conductivities of the glass-ceramics in the composition range of 25 ≤ x ≤ 100, where unknown phases are crystallized, were 10-7-10-5 S cm-1. These were lower than the conductivities of the corresponding glasses before heat treatment. The 90Na3PS4·10Na4SiS4 electrolyte showed a wide electrochemical window of 5 V. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.",RSC Advances
On the challenge of developing advanced technologies for electrochemical energy storage and conversion,"The accelerated production of sophisticated miniaturized mobile electronic devices, challenges such as the electrochemical propulsion of electric vehicles (EVs), and the need for large-scale storage of sustainable energy (i.e. load-levelling applications) motivate and stimulate the development of novel rechargeable batteries and super-capacitors. While batteries deliver high energy density but limited cycle life and power density, super-capacitors provide high power density and very prolonged cycling. Lithium-ion batteries are the focus of intensive R&D efforts because they promise very high energy density that may be suitable for electrical propulsion. Here, we review research on batteries with an emphasis on Li-ion battery technology, examining its suitability for EV applications. We also briefly examine other battery systems that may be of importance for load-levelling applications, including rechargeable magnesium batteries. We give a short review of the status of technologies beyond Li-ion batteries, including Li-sulfur and Li-oxygen systems. Finally, we briefly discuss recent progress in the R&D of advanced super-capacitors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Materials Today
An all-solid-state sodium-sulfur battery operating at room temperature using a high-sulfur-content positive composite electrode,"© 2014 The Chemical Society of Japan.The performance of an all-solid-state sodiumsulfur (NaS) battery at 25 °C, in which the sulfur content in the positive composite electrode was 50 wt% to enhance energy density, was investigated. All-solid-state NaS cells prepared using a positive composite electrode with a high-phosphorus-to-sulfur-ratio solid electrolyte exhibited a high capacity of approximately 1500mAh g-1at 0.13mAcm-2at 25 °C.

The effect of electrolyte on the electrochemical properties of Na/α-NaMnO2 batteries,"Pure α-NaMnO2 cathode materials were prepared by solid-state reaction with Mn2O3 and Na2CO 3 at 750 °C. Electrochemical properties of Na/α-NaMnO 2 battery was investigated with electrolytes as 1 M NaClO4 EC/DEC and 1 M NaBF4 TEGDME. First discharge capacity of Na/α-NaMnO2 cell using 1 M NaClO4 EC/DEC electrolyte and 1 M NaBF4 TEGDME electrolyte was 146 mAh g-1 and 136 mAh g-1 discharge capacity for the first cycle at 0.2 C rate and 104 mAh g-1 97 mAh g-1 after 20 cycles, respectively. Na/α-NaMnO2 battery with 1 M NaClO4 EC/DEC electrolyte shows higher initial charge/discharge capacity than that using 1 M NaBF4 TEGDME because of high ionic conductivity of electrolyte and low interfacial resistance between the electrolyte and electrode. However, Na/α-NaMnO2 battery with 1 M NaBF4 TEGDME electrolyte has better stability for the 20th cycle from coulombic efficiency result because of stability of interfacial resistance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Materials Research Bulletin

Separators - Technology review: Ceramic based separators for secondary batteries,"Besides a continuous increase of the worldwide use of electricity, the electric energy storage technology market is a growing sector. At the latest since the German energy transition (""Energiewende"") was announced, technological solutions for the storage of renewable energy have been intensively studied. Storage technologies in various forms are commercially available. A widespread technology is the electrochemical cell. Here the cost per kWh, e. g. determined by energy density, production process and cycle life, is of main interest. Commonly, an electrochemical cell consists of an anode and a cathode that are separated by an ion permeable or ion conductive membrane - the separator - as one of the main components. Many applications use polymeric separators whose pores are filled with liquid electrolyte, providing high power densities. However, problems arise from different failure mechanisms during cell operation, which can affect the integrity and functionality of these separators. In the case of excessive heating or mechanical damage, the polymeric separators become an incalculable security risk. Furthermore, the growth of metallic dendrites between the electrodes leads to unwanted short circuits. In order to minimize these risks, temperature stable and non-flammable ceramic particles can be added, forming so-called composite separators. Full ceramic separators, in turn, are currently commercially used only for high-temperature operation systems, due to their comparably low ion conductivity at room temperature. However, as security and lifetime demands increase, these materials turn into focus also for future room temperature applications. Hence, growing research effort is being spent on the improvement of the ion conductivity of these ceramic solid electrolyte materials, acting as separator and electrolyte at the same time. Starting with a short overview of available separator technologies and the separator market, this review focuses on ceramic-based separators. Two prominent examples, the lithium-ion and sodium-sulfur battery, are described to show the current stage of development. New routes are presented as promising technologies for safe and long-life electrochemical storage cells. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.",AIP Conference Proceedings

"Ionic conductivity, morphology and transference number of sodium ion in PMMA based gel polymer electrolytes","The gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) composed of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) with sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaCF3SO3) salt dissolved in a binary mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) organic solvents have been prepared by solution casting technique. The samples are prepared by varying the salt concentrations from 5 wt.% to 30 wt.%. Impedance spectroscopy measurement has been carried out to determine the ionic conductivity of the GPE samples. The sample containing 20 wt.% of NaCF3SO3 salt exhibits the highest room temperature ionic conductivity of 3.10 x 10-3S cm-1. The conductivity of the GPEs has been found to depend on the salt concentration added to the sample though at higher salt concentration reveals decreasing in ionic conductivity due to ions association. The temperature dependence of conductivity from 303 K to 373 K is found to obey the Arrhenius rule. The ionic transference number, ti of GPEs has been estimated by DC polarization method and the value is found to be 0.95, 0.99, and 0.97 for the sample containing 5 wt.%, 20 wt.% and 30 wt.% respectively. This result is consistent with the conductivity studies. Copyright © 2014 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.",Key Engineering Materials
Finite element analysis study on the thermomechanical stability of thermal compression bonding (TCB) joints in tubular sodium sulfur cells,"A typical large capacity sodium sulfur (NaS) battery is operated at 300-350 C with 20-50 C thermal fluctuations during its charging and discharging. In addition, for maintenance purposes, the cell experiences larger temperature changes down to the intermediate or room temperatures. Such temperature changes can cause mechanical failure of heterogeneous joints such as thermal compression bonding (TCB) joints, which is one of the most critical issues in developing NaS batteries. The present study seeks to build a computational finite element analysis (FEA) model to predict the thermomechanical responses of NaS batteries to the attack induced by the temperature changes. Specifically, the thermomechanical stress accumulation at TCB joints of a tubular cell has been explored during its booting-and-shutdown cycles. Static temperature profiles and simplified friction conditions in the cathode wall were assumed for the model. Using the developed model, the stress components that dominantly contribute the stress accumulation at the joint were identified, and the effects of TCB geometries and container material types on the thermal stress accumulation at the TCB joints were carefully examined. It turns out that the stress accumulation at the bonding interface would be critical for the failure at the TCB joints. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Journal of Power Sources
Sulfur infiltrated activated carbon cathodes for lithium sulfur cells: The combined effects of pore size distribution and electrolyte molarity,"In this paper, we adopted three different commercial activated carbon samples (ACs) having different particle size, specific surface area and pore size to make sulfur-carbon (S-AC) nanocomposites for rechargeable lithium sulfur batteries. The effect of the physical parameters of ACs and the combined effect of electrolyte molarity were investigated. The performance of the cells at two different temperatures of 25 and 70 C were compared. For room temperature operation of the cells, the capacities of S infiltrated into microporous AC having smaller pore size and stronger interactions with sulfur and sulfides were lower than those of the S infiltrated into micro- and mesoporous ACs containing larger pores. In contrast, the microporous AC demonstrated higher capacity at the elevated temperature due to the improved ion transport rate. The effect of electrolyte molarity on the performance of Li/S cells was found to depend on the AC pore size and particle size distributions. Increasing electrolyte molarity from 1 to 3 M demonstrated improved cell performance and reduced polysulfide dissolution in all the studied S-AC samples. However, further increasing electrolyte salt concentration resulted in a high polarization and reduced cell performance in S-ACs having large particle size or smaller pores. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Composite PEOn:NaTFSI polymer electrolyte: Preparation, thermal and electrochemical characterization","Membranes of sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonate) imide (NaTFSI) complexed with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) salt have been prepared by a solvent-free hot-pressing technique with different EO:Na molar ratio. All membranes show good ionic conductivities in the range of 10-3 S cm-1 above 70 C. However, the more NaTFSI-concentrated samples are sticky gums due to the plasticizing nature of the anion. The PEO20:NaTFSI sample exhibits the compromise of conductivity, thermal and mechanical properties. The addition of nanometric SiO2 to the PEO20:NaTFSI membranes further enhances their mechanical properties. Moreover, the PEO20:NaTFSI + 5 wt.% SiO2 membranes show similar ionic conductivity and similar anodic electrochemical stability in comparison to the ceramic free PEO 20:NaTFSI sample. In a Na(s)/polymer electrolyte/Na (s) symmetrical cell followed up to 30 days, the presence of the ceramic filler slightly increased the interface resistance in comparison to the ceramic-free membrane. Nuclear magnetic resonance determinations of anion diffusion coefficients and Na+ mobility suggest that presence of filler may have a positive affect on the cation transference number that is in accordance with the tNa+ transference number measurement. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Ionic liquid based electrolytes for sodium-ion batteries: Na+ solvation and ionic conductivity,"Ionic liquid (IL) based sodium-ion (Na+) battery electrolytes obtained by mixing imidazolium-TFSI ILs (EMIm-TFSI and BMIm-TFSI) with the corresponding sodium salt (NaTFSI) have been investigated using a wide range of characterization techniques: dielectric spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, densitometry, viscometry, and Raman spectroscopy. The sodium ion conducting electrolytes exhibit excellent ionic conductivities, up to 5.5 mS cm-1 at room temperature, and a useful thermal window of -86 C to 150 C. In more detail, Raman data analysis supported by DFT calculations on Na +-TFSI complexes, allow us to determine the sodium ion solvation and charge carrier nature as a function of salt concentration. The results are compared to data for the corresponding Li systems and while such electrolytes essentially form [Li(TFSI)2]- as the main Li+ carrier, the sodium systems seem to dominantly form [Na(TFSI)3] 2- complexes. The effects on conductivity and viscosity and the consequences for sodium-ion battery implementation are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Journal of Power Sources
Properties of sodium-based ionic liquid electrolytes for sodium secondary battery applications,"The enormous demands on available global lithium resources have raised concerns about the sustainability of the supply of lithium. Sodium secondary batteries have emerged as promising alternatives to lithium batteries. We describe here sodium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide (NaNTf2) electrolyte systems based on 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide (C4mpyrNTf2) ionic liquids. The electrochemical stability of the system was examined; a pair of facile cathodic and anodic processes around 0 V vs. Na/Na+ were observed in cyclic voltammetry measurements and interpreted as deposition and dissolution of sodium metal. Density, viscosity and conductivity of the electrolytes were studied. It was found that the ionic conductivity of electrolytes reached as high as 8 mS/cm, decreasing slowly as the salt content increased due to increasing of viscosity and density of the electrolyte. Therefore, sodium electrolytes based on C4mpyrNTf2 appear to be promising for secondary sodium battery applications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Electrochimica Acta
Degradation of NASICON-type materials in contact with lithium metal: Formation of mixed conducting interphases (MCI) on solid electrolytes,"We report on the transport properties of lithium ion conducting glass ceramics represented by the general composition Li1+x-yAl x3+My5+M2-x-y 4+(PO4)3 with NASICON-type structure and their stability in contact with lithium metal. In particular, solid electrolyte phases with M = Ge, M = Ti, Ge, and M = Ti, Ta were investigated. AC impedance spectroscopy and DC polarization measurements were applied to determine the conductivity as a function of temperature, and to extract the partial electronic conductivity. The maximum total conductivity at room temperature was found to be about 4 × 10-4 S/cm for the solely Ge containing sample. We demonstrate that the combination of vacuum-based lithium thin film deposition and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is well suited to study the reactivity of the solid electrolyte membranes in contact with lithium. As a major result, we show that none of the materials investigated is stable in contact with lithium metal, and we discuss the reactive interaction between solid electrolytes and Li metal in terms of the formation of a mixed (ionic/electronic) conducting interphase (MCI) following the well-known SEI concept in liquid electrolytes. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",Journal of Physical Chemistry C
Conversion reactions for sodium-ion batteries,"Research on sodium-ion batteries has recently been rediscovered and is currently mainly focused on finding suitable electrode materials that enable cell reactions of high energy densities combined with low cost. Naturally, an assessment of potential electrode materials requires a rational comparison with the analogue reaction in lithium-ion batteries. In this paper, we systematically discuss the broad range of different conversion reactions for sodium-ion batteries based on their basic thermodynamic properties and compare them with their lithium analogues. Capacities, voltages, energy densities and volume expansions are summarized to sketch out the scope for future studies in this research field. We show that for a given conversion electrode material, replacing lithium by sodium leads to a constant shift in cell potential ΔEo(Li-Na) depending on the material class. For chlorides ΔEo(Li-Na) equals nearly zero. The theoretical energy densities of conversion reactions of sodium with fluorides or chlorides as positive electrode materials typically reach values between 700 W h kg-1 and 1000 W h kg-1. Next to the thermodynamic assessment, results on several conversion reactions between copper compounds (CuS, CuO, CuCl, CuCl2) and sodium are being discussed. Reactions with CuS and CuO were chosen because these compounds are frequently studied for conversion reactions with lithium. Chlorides are interesting because of ΔEo(Li-Na) ≈ 0 V. As a result of chloride solubility in the electrolyte, the conversion process proceeds at defined potentials under rather small kinetic limitations. © 2013 The Owner Societies.",Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics

One-dimensional carbon-sulfur composite fibers for Na-S rechargeable batteries operating at room temperature,"Na-S batteries are one type of molten salt battery and have been used to support stationary energy storage systems for several decades. Despite their successful applications based on long cycle lives and low cost of raw materials, Na-S cells require high temperatures above 300 C for their operations, limiting their propagation into a wide range of applications. Herein, we demonstrate that Na-S cells with solid state active materials can perform well even at room temperature when sulfur-containing carbon composites generated from a simple thermal reaction were used as sulfur positive electrodes. Furthermore, this structure turned out to be robust during repeated (de)sodiation for ∼500 cycles and enabled extraordinarily high rate performance when one-dimensional morphology is adopted using scalable electrospinning processes. The current study suggests that solid-state Na-S cells with appropriate atomic configurations of sulfur active materials could cover diverse battery applications where cost of raw materials is critical. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",Nano Letters
Synthesis of Na-β-Al2O3 nanopowders by PVP sol-gel process,"As the key material of the β-Al2O3 electrolyte of sodium sulfur battery (SSB), the properties of Na-β-Al2O3 powders play an important role in the performance of SSB. In this study, nanosized Na-β-Al2O3 powders were prepared by Sol-Gel process with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as the chelating agent. The phase formation temperature of the Na-β-Al2O3 by the PVP-based process was reduced to 900°C, which was much lower than those of conventional SSR and most chemical synthesis methods. The new method can effectively inhibit the performance decline of the Na-β-Al2O3 ceramics induced by the volatilization of Na2O at high temperature in the conventional method. The powders were characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM techniques. It was demonstrated that the phase was pure and the particles were well dispersed with diameter of 60-70 nm, which were helpful to the good performance of Na-β-Al2O3 ceramics. In addition, the conductivities of the Na-β-Al2O3 ceramics sintered by the as-prepared powders were measured by AC impedance spectroscope and the evaluation of the spectra was carried out with increasing temperature from room temperature to 350°C. The electrical conductivity of the ceramics at 350°C reached 0.22 S/cm.",Wuji Cailiao Xuebao/Journal of Inorganic Materials
Solubility of sodium chloride in ionic liquids,"In this study, the solubility of sodium chloride in 16 imidazolium-, pyrrolidinium-, pyridinium-, and ammonium-based ionic liquids at different temperatures was measured. The solubility of sodium chloride was found to increase with temperature in all of the ionic liquids studied. Both cations and anions in the ionic liquid affected solubility, but anions had more of an effect than cations. The highest measured solubility of sodium chloride was 8.96 wt % at 125 C in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate. The nonrandom two-liquid model was used to calculate the solubility of sodium chloride in some ionic liquids.

Synthesis of Na-β″/β-Al2O3 nanorods in an ionic liquid,"Li-stabilized Na-β″/β-Al2O3(Na 1.61Li0.29Al10.70O17) nanorods were prepared by a soft chemistry process using a 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([CXmim]Br, X = 4, 12, 16) ionic liquid as a template. Pure Na-β″/β-Al2O3 rods were obtained by heating at 1100 °C with [C16mim]Br as the template, resulting in nanorods of approximately 50 nm in diameter and 200-300 nm in length. It is demonstrated that alkyl chain length is the main factor determining the aspect ratio of the nanorods. The specific surface area of the powder is 81.3 m2/g, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the powder prepared by a conventional solid state reaction process. The formation mechanism of the nanorods is proposed. Copyright © 2013 Materials Research Society.",Journal of Materials Research

Magnesium ion transport in poly(ethylene oxide)-based polymer electrolyte containing plastic-crystalline succinonitrile,"A new composition of magnesium (Mg)-ion-conducting polymer electrolyte comprising poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) complexed with Mg trifluoromethanesulfonate (Mg triflate or Mg(Tf)2) containing different amounts of a nonionic plastic crystal succinonitrile (SN) has been prepared and characterized. High polarity and rotational disorder of the SN molecules in the plastic-crystalline phase, supports the enhancement of ionic conductivity of the PEO-Mg(Tf)2 complex system, showing a maximum room temperature ionic conductivity of ∼6 × 10-4 S cm -1 observed with the addition of 50 wt.% of SN. X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry suggest a substantial structural modification, decrease in crystallinity, and various interactions in the polymer electrolyte components due to addition of SN. The cyclic voltammetry, impedance, and dc polarization studies confirm the Mg-ion conduction in the PEO complex. The electrochemical potential window of the electrolyte, observed from the linear sweep voltammetry, is determined to be ∼4.1 V.

Thermodynamics and cell chemistry of room temperature sodium/sulfur cells with liquid and liquid/solid electrolyte,"The cell chemistry of sodium/sulfur cells operating at room temperature (RT-Na/S cells) is being studied electrochemically and structurally. We show by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that the cell reaction is incomplete but prove that the end members of the cell reaction (S and Na2S) form among the expected polysulfide species Na2Sx. The sulfur utilization can be improved by employing a solid electrolyte membrane (beta″-alumina) that prevents the diffusion of the soluble polysulfide species toward the sodium side. As an important finding, the Na+ conduction within the solid electrolyte phase and across the two liquid/solid interfaces results in only small overpotentials. Nevertheless the utilization of sulfur in the present RT-Na/S (475 mAh g-1) cells is lower than the theoretical value (1675 mAh g-1). One probable reason is the chemical instability of the widely used PVDF binder. Also, the thermodynamic properties of RT-Na/S cells operating at room temperature are discussed and compared with the currently much more studied RT-Li/S cells. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Development and characterizations of Bi2O3-containing glass-ceramic sealants for sodium sulfur battery,"Bi2O3-containing glass-ceramic sealants for sodium sulfur battery are developed by doping the nucleating agent TiO2. The crystallization behavior of the glasses with the dopants is studied. The addition of nucleating agent TiO2 induces the precipitation of Bi2Ti2O7 crystal. The thermal expansion match between the Bi2O3-containing glass-ceramics and the α-, β-Al2O3 is relatively satisfactory. The joining properties of the sealants involving the bonding strength, thermal shock resistance, chemical stability and corrosion resistance are evaluated. No microcracks were observed in the AC5/α-, β-Al2O 3 joint after 200-times thermal shock between 350 C and room temperature. The thickness of diffusion layer was about 10 μm after holding at 350 C for 200 h. Moreover, the existence of small size crystalline Bi 2Ti2O7 phase reasonably enhances the sulfur corrosion resistance. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids
A novel low-cost sodium-zinc chloride battery,"The sodium-metal halide (ZEBRA) batteries have been considered as one of the most attractive energy storage systems for stationary and transportation applications. Even though the battery technologies have been widely investigated for a few decades, there is still a need to further improve the battery performance, cost and safety for practical applications. In the present work, a novel low-cost Na-ZnCl2 battery with a planar β′′- Al2O3 solid electrolyte (BASE) was proposed, and its electrochemical reactions and battery performance were investigated. Compared to Na-NiCl2 chemistry, the ZnCl2-based chemistry was more complicated, in which multiple electrochemical reactions including liquid-phase formation occurred at temperatures above 253 °C. During the first stage of charge, NaCl reacted with Zn to form Na in the anode and Na2ZnCl 4 in the cathode. Once all the NaCl was consumed, further charge with the reaction between Na2ZnCl4 and Zn led to the formation of a NaCl-ZnCl2 liquid phase. During the end of charge, the liquid phase reacted with Zn to produce solid ZnCl2. To identify the effect of liquid-phase formation on electrochemical performance, button cells were assembled and tested at 280 and 240 °C. At 280 °C, with the liquid phase formed during cycling, cells revealed quite stable cyclability. On the other hand, more rapid increase in polarization was observed at 240 °C where only solid-state electrochemical reactions occurred. SEM analysis indicated that the stable performance at 280 °C was due to the suppressed growth of Zn and NaCl particles, which were generated from the liquid phase during the discharge of each cycle. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Energy and Environmental Science
Evolution of strategies for modern rechargeable batteries,"This Account provides perspective on the evolution of the rechargeable battery and summarizes innovations in the development of these devices. Initially, I describe the components of a conventional rechargeable battery along with the engineering parameters that define the figures of merit for a single cell. In 1967, researchers discovered fast Na+ conduction at 300 K in Na β,β′′-alumina. Since then battery technology has evolved from a strongly acidic or alkaline aqueous electrolyte with protons as the working ion to an organic liquid-carbonate electrolyte with Li + as the working ion in a Li-ion battery. The invention of the sodium-sulfur and Zebra batteries stimulated consideration of framework structures as crystalline hosts for mobile guest alkali ions, and the jump in oil prices in the early 1970s prompted researchers to consider alternative room-temperature batteries with aprotic liquid electrolytes. With the existence of Li primary cells and ongoing research on the chemistry of reversible Li intercalation into layered chalcogenides, industry invested in the production of a Li/TiS2 rechargeable cell. However, on repeated recharge, dendrites grew across the electrolyte from the anode to the cathode, leading to dangerous short-circuits in the cell in the presence of the flammable organic liquid electrolyte. Because lowering the voltage of the anode would prevent cells with layered-chalcogenide cathodes from competing with cells that had an aqueous electrolyte, researchers quickly abandoned this effort. However, once it was realized that an oxide cathode could offer a larger voltage versus lithium, researchers considered the extraction of Li from the layered LiMO2 oxides with M = Co or Ni.These oxide cathodes were fabricated in a discharged state, and battery manufacturers could not conceive of assembling a cell with a discharged cathode. Meanwhile, exploration of Li intercalation into graphite showed that reversible Li insertion into carbon occurred without dendrite formation. The SONY corporation used the LiCoO2/carbon battery to power their initial cellular telephone and launched the wireless revolution. As researchers developed 3D transition-metal hosts, manufacturers introduced spinel and olivine hosts in the Lix[Mn2]O4 and LiFe(PO4) cathodes. However, current Li-ion batteries fall short of the desired specifications for electric-powered automobiles and the storage of electrical energy generated by wind and solar power. These demands are stimulating new strategies for electrochemical cells that can safely and affordably meet those challenges. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",Accounts of Chemical Research

Thermodynamics of electrochemical lithium storage,"The thermodynamics of electrochemical lithium storage are examined by taking into account that it is the point defects that enable storage. While the Li defects are mobile, most of the other point defects have to be considered as frozen owing to the performance temperature being low compared to the melting point of the electrode materials. The defect chemistry needs to be considered to fully understand equilibrium charge/discharge curves. On this basis, single phase and multiphase storage mechanisms can be discussed in terms of theoretical storage capacity and theoretical voltage. Of paramount interest in the field of Li batteries are metastable materials, in particular nanocrystalline and amorphous materials. The thermodynamics of storage and voltage, also at interfaces, thus deserve a special treatment. The relationship between reversible cell voltage and lithium content is derived for the novel job-sharing mechanism. With respect to the classic storage modes, thermodynamic differences for cathodes and anodes are elaborated with a special attention being paid to the search for new materials. As this contribution concentrates on the equilibrium state, current-related phenomena (irreversible thermodynamics) are only briefly touched upon. No defects, no equilibrium: The equilibrium properties of electrochemical storage of lithium in solids are treated bearing in mind that defects in solids are the mechanistically relevant centers. Nanomaterials and amorphous materials are dealt with in the context of constrained equilibria.

The viscosity and ionic conductivity of NaFSA-C1C3pyrFSA with a molar ratio of 2:8 were 16.7 cP and 15.6 mS cm-1, respectively, at 353 K. The electrochemical window of this ionic liquid was 5.2 V at 353 K with sodium metal deposition determining the cathode limit.

Electrochemical and structural investigation of NaCrO2 as a positive electrode for sodium secondary battery using inorganic ionic liquid NaFSA-KFSA,"The electrochemical performance of NaCrO2 as a positive electrode material for an intermediate-temperature sodium secondary battery was evaluated in an inorganic ionic liquid, NaFSA-KFSA (FSA = bis(fluorosulfonyl) amide), at 363 K. The positive electrode using NaCrO2, acetylene black, and polytetrafluoroethylene exhibited a stable discharge capacity of 113 mA h g-1 at a current density of 125 mA g-1. The Coulombic efficiency and the capacity retention at the 100th cycle were 99.6% and 98.5%, respectively. Even at the very high current density of 2000 mA g-1, the discharge capacity was maintained at 63 mA h g-1.

Thermodynamic studies on Sn-Na alloy in an intermediate temperature ionic liquid NaFSA-KFSA at 363 K,"The equilibrium potentials for Sn-Na alloy formation reactions are investigated in an intermediate temperature ionic liquid, NaFSA-KFSA (x NaFSA = 0.56, xKFSA = 0.44, FSA = bis(fluorosulfonyl) amides), at 363 K. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) is employed to obtain the potential-Na composition curve of the Sn-Na alloy. Ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals that plateaus at 0.16 and 0.08 V vs. Na+/Na in the potential-Na composition curve correspond to α-NaSn/Na9Sn4 and Na9Sn 4/Na15Sn4 two-phase states, respectively. Although distinct potential plateaus are not observed, the equilibrium potentials of β-Sn/NaSn2 and NaSn2/α-NaSn are suggested to be 0.53 and 0.46 V vs. Na+/Na, respectively. Finally, the Gibbs free energies of formation of the Sn-Na alloys are calculated and compared with reported data. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Journal of Power Sources
Reversible sodiation in maricite NaMn1/3Co1/3Ni 1/3PO4 for renewable energy storage,"Battery technology is now at a point where water based sodium batteries may take a place in large-scale applications such as electrical grid stabilization. The starting point for new aqueous based sodium battery technology is to understand the fundamental differences between lithium versus sodium in similar host materials synthesized via non-ceramic synthetic approaches. The new sodium phosphate host compound, NaMn1/3Co1/3Ni 1/3PO4, has been synthesized using sol-gel and combustion routes. The framework of sodium phosphate with a maricite structure is analogous to olivine based lithium phosphate compound, except the M(1) and M(2) sites have reverse occupancies. Physical and electrochemical characterization indicate that the combustion synthesized sodium analogue is fully reversible (electrochemically intercalating and de-intercalating sodium ions) in water based NaOH electrolyte for multiple cycles. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Electrochemical properties and discharge mechanism of Na/TiS2 cells with liquid electrolyte at room temperature,"The electrochemical properties of Na/TiS2 cells fabricated from Na anodes and TiS2 cathodes and 1M sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate in tetraethyleneglycol dimethylether liquid electrolyte have been investigated. The discharge curve has two plateau regions of 2.1 V and 1.6 V. The loss of discharge capacity appeared mainly in the upper plateau (UP) region (2.0-2.6 V) and the discharge capacity in the low plateau (LP) region (0.8-2.0 V) does not decrease and is consistent during 40 cycles. The discharge process between Na and TiS2 has a complex reaction mechanism, the intercalation at the upper plateau region and the conversion at the low plateau region. Because, a distorted TiS2 phase appeared in the upper plateau, a new phase of NaxTiS2 was observed in the lower plateau, and the Na xTiS2 phase was disappeared after full discharge from the XRD and TEM results. The decrease of discharge capacity during cycling is occurred from the formation of NaxTiS2 phase in the cathode after full charging and is accumulated over cycling. © 2012 The Electrochemical Society.",Journal of the Electrochemical Society
"A conductive polypyrrole-coated, sulfur-carbon nanotube composite for use in lithium-sulfur batteries","A novel ternary composite, polypyrrole (PPy)-coated sulphur-carbon nanotube (S-CNT), is synthesised by using an in situ, one-pot method. Firstly, elemental sulfur is loaded into the CNT network by a solution-based processing technique. Then conducting PPy is coated on the surface of the S-CNT composite to form the S-CNT-PPy ternary composite by carrying out polymerization of the pyrrole monomer in situ. The ternary composite is tested as a cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries. The results show that PPy coating improves significantly the performance of the binary composites (S-CNT and S-PPy). The conducting PPy is believed to serve multiple functions in the composite: as a conducting additive, an active material, and an adsorbent and container to confine the polysulfides and prevent them from dissolving into the electrolyte. As a result, PPy coating on the S-CNT composite enhances its conductivity, capacity and cycling stability. The capacity of S-CNT-PPy is about 600 mAh g-1 after 40 cycles, which is much higher than for the S-CNT composite (430 mAh g -1). © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.",ChemPlusChem
Aromatic porous-honeycomb electrodes for a sodium-organic energy storage device,"Rechargeable batteries using organic electrodes and sodium as a charge carrier can be high-performance, affordable energy storage devices due to the abundance of both sodium and organic materials. However, only few organic materials have been found to be active in sodium battery systems. Here we report a high-performance sodium-based energy storage device using a bipolar porous organic electrode constituted of aromatic rings in a porous-honeycomb structure. Unlike typical organic electrodes in sodium battery systems, the bipolar porous organic electrode has a high specific power of 10 kW kg -1, specific energy of 500 Wh kg -1, and over 7,000 cycle life retaining 80% of its initial capacity in half-cells. The use of bipolar porous organic electrode in a sodium-organic energy storage device would significantly enhance cost-effectiveness, and reduce the dependency on limited natural resources.

High energy density Na-S/NiCl2 hybrid battery,"High temperature (250-350 °C) sodium-beta alumina batteries (NBBs) are attractive energy storage devices for renewable energy integration and other grid related applications. Currently, two technologies are commercially available in NBBs, e.g., sodium-sulfur (Na-S) battery and sodium-metal halide (ZEBRA) batteries. In this study, we investigated the combination of these two chemistries with a mixed cathode. In particular, the cathode consisted of molten NaAlCl4 as a catholyte and a mixture of Ni, NaCl and Na2S as active materials. During cycling, two reversible plateaus were observed in cell voltage profiles, which matched electrochemical reactions for Na-S and Na-NiCl2 redox couples. An irreversible reaction between sulfur species and Ni was identified during initial charge at 280 °C, which caused a decrease in cell capacity. The final products on discharge included Na 2Sn with 1 < n < 3, which differed from that of Na2S3 in traditional Na-S battery. This novel battery demonstrated a 50% increase in energy density over ZEBRA batteries. Despite of the initial drop in cell capacity, the mixed cathode demonstrated relatively stable cycling with more than 95% of cell capacity retained over 60 cycles. Optimization of the cathode may lead to further improvements in battery performance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Journal of Power Sources

PVdF-HFP as a polymer host, lithium perchlorate (LiClO<inf>4</inf>) as a salt for lithium ion, and ZnO nanoparticles as fillers were used to form the nanocomposite solid polymer electrolyte films. All the prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron microscopy. The XRD patterns of the pure and nanocomposite solid polymer electrolyte samples indicate the formation of amorphous phase with 17.5 wt.% of lithium salt and ZnO fillers up to 3 wt.%.

Advanced intermediate-temperature Na-S battery,"In this study, we reported an intermediate-temperature (∼150 °C) sodium-sulfur (Na-S) battery. With a relatively low operating temperature, this novel battery could reduce the cost and safety issues associated with the conventional high-temperature (300-350 °C) Na-S battery. A dense β′′-Al2O3 solid membrane and tetraglyme were utilized as the electrolyte separator and catholyte solvent in this battery. Solubility tests indicated that a cathode mixture of Na 2S4 and S exhibited extremely high solubility in tetraglyme (e.g., >4.1 M for Na2S4 + 4 S). CV scans of Na2S4 in tetraglyme revealed two pairs of redox couples with peaks at around 2.22 and 1.75 V, corresponding to the redox reactions of polysulfide species. The discharge/charge profiles of the Na-S battery showed a slope region and a plateau, indicating multiple steps and cell reactions. In situ Raman measurements during battery operation suggested that polysulfide species were formed in the sequence of Na2S5 + S → Na2S5 + Na2S4 → Na 2S4 + Na2S2 during discharge and in a reverse order during charge.

Selection of battery technology to support grid-integrated renewable electricity,"Operation of the electricity grid has traditionally been done using slow responding base and intermediate load generators with fast responding peak load generators to capture the chaotic behavior of end-use demands. Many modern electricity grids are implementing intermittent non-dispatchable renewable energy resources. As a result, the existing support services are becoming inadequate and technological innovation in grid support services are necessary. Support services fall into short (seconds to minutes), medium (minutes to hours), and long duration (several hours) categories. Energy storage offers a method of providing these services and can enable increased penetration rates of renewable energy generators. Many energy storage technologies exist. Of these, batteries span a significant range of required storage capacity and power output. By assessing the energy to power ratio of electricity grid services, suitable battery technologies were selected. These include lead-acid, lithium-ion, sodium-sulfur, and vanadium-redox. Findings show the variety of grid services require different battery technologies and batteries are capable of meeting the short, medium, and long duration categories.

Lithium-liquid battery: Harvesting lithium from waste Li-ion batteries and discharging with water,"This study demonstrates the feasibility of using water and the contents of waste Li-ion batteries for the electrodes in a Li-liquid battery system. Li metal was collected electrochemically from a waste Li-ion battery containing Li-ion source materials from the battery's anode, cathode, and electrolyte, thereby recycling the Li contained in the waste battery at room temperature. The harvested Li metal in the battery system was discharged to produce electricity by using water as the cathode. The discharge voltage of the water showed 2.7 V at 0.1 mA cm -2versus Li metal harvested from waste Li-ion batteries, compared to 2.8 V versus fresh Li metal at the same current rate.

Formation and structure of Na2S + P2S5 amorphous materials prepared by melt-quenching and mechanical milling,"xNa2S + (1 - x)P2S5 amorphous and partially crystalline materials were prepared by melt-quenching and mechanical milling. These products were characterized using x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopy. Compared to the narrower x-ray amorphous range for this system obtained through melt-quenching as found in this study, 0.50 ≤ x ≤ 0.67, the x-ray amorphous range for this system could be extended from the low-alkali ultra-thiophosphate composition of x ∼ 0.25 to slightly above the high-alkali pyro-thiophosphate composition of x ∼ 0.70 using mechanical milling. Mechanically milled samples with Na2S of composition x = 0.75 yielded a partially crystalline material that had diffuse XRD peaks associated to the α-Na3PS4 phase. A similar result was obtained for the x = 0.80 composition except that, as expected, it also showed peaks for unreacted (over stoichiometric) Na2S. The melt-quenched and mechanically milled samples with the same compositions 0.50 ≤ x ≤ 0.67 showed similar FT-IR and Raman spectra, indicating very similar chemical short-range structures are present in both of these amorphous materials. It was found that the Na2S + P2S5 system exhibited similar behavior to that of the Li2S + P 2S5 in that chemical reaction between Na2S and P2S5 could be induced by mechanical milling near room temperature to produce both amorphous and polycrystalline materials. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Lifetime and efficiency studies of zinc/bromine electrochemical energy storage in large scale renewable energy applications,"As the world's power needs grow, the demand for power from renewable resources, such as wind or solar, is increasing. One major drawback associated with these renewable resources is that the power output is dependent on environmental factors, such as cloud cover and wind speeds. This allows the possibilities of either power output exceeding or falling short of forecast levels which may lead to grid instabilities. Therefore, Large Scale Energy Storage (LSES) systems are critical to store excess power when the output exceeds demand in order to supplement output power when it falls short of demand. Some promising LSES contenders are: 1) Zinc bromide flow cells (FC), 2) Vanadium redox FC, 3) Sodium sulfur batteries, and 4) Lead acid batteries. Of these available technologies the zinc bromide technology was selected for further investigation because of previously reported long cycle-life (CL) and high efficiencies. In this work, the cell efficiency dependence on temperature of a bench scale Zinc Bromide battery manufactured in our lab was investigated to confirm the theoretical efficiency. Efficiency cycling was voltage limited on the discharge cycle at a 1.5 / V cell cut-off potential. Standard method of measuring columbic efficiency was implemented. At room temperature, ∼80% efficiency was achieved when cycling the system between 20 - 100% State of Charge (SOC), which is in good agreement with published values. The cell efficiency was demonstrated at over 90% at 50°C and cycling between 20 - 100% SOC. In addition, given that deep discharge is perceived as highly damaging to electrochemical energy storage, the battery was cycled through the Zero-Point (ZP) 10,000 times. The cell was continuously cycled between 0 - 5% (SOC). Battery performance was evaluated from transfer rate and exchange current density, determined using Tafel scans. No degradation of the electrodes was found, and in fact a slight increase in the exchange current density was observed. We interpret this exchange current increase as a result expected for electrode conditioning of the polished carbon electrode substrates used in our test cells. These along with further more recent results will be presented.","11AIChE - 2011 AIChE Annual Meeting, Conference Proceedings"

Physical characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been performed to study the structural changes and the ion-filler-polymer interactions due to the dispersion of SiO2 nanoparticles in gel electrolytes. The highest ionic conductivity of the electrolyte has been observed to be 4.1 × 10 -3 S cm- 1 at room temperature with ~ 3 wt.% of SiO 2 particles. The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity has been found to be consistent with Vogel-Tammen-Fulcher (VTF) relationship in the temperature range from 40 to 70 °C. The sodium ion conduction in the gel electrolyte film is confirmed from the cyclic voltammetry, impedance analysis and transport number measurements. The value of sodium ion transport number (tNa+) of the gel electrolyte is significantly enhanced to a maximum value of 0.52 on the 15 wt.% SiO2 dispersion. The physical and electrochemical analyses indicate the suitability of the gel electrolyte films in the sodium batteries. A prototype sodium-sulfur battery, fabricated using optimized gel electrolyte, offers the first discharge capacity of ~165 mAh g- 1 of sulfur. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Effect of glutaraldehyde on electrical properties of arrowroot starch + NaI electrolyte system,"A biopolymer based electrolyte system has been developed using NaI as dopant salt and Arrowroot starch as polymer matrix. Problem of fungal growth in such system has been removed by the addition of Glutaraldehyde (GA). The conductivity of the Arrowroot + NaI electrolyte system is of the order of 6.7 Ã - 10-4 S cm-1. Starch without crosslinker GA seems to be highly unstable and prone to fungal growth whereas the GA crosslinked electrolyte is quite stable. Color of the material as well as its conductivity data indicate that presence of GA affects the salt dissociation and multiplets formation.

Electrical conductivity and structure of glasses in the Na 2O-Na2S-P2O5 and Na 2S-P2S5 systems,"The glasses, in which oxygen was partially replaced with sulfur, have been synthesized in the Na2O-P2O5-Na2S system. The chemical and chromatographic analyses of the glasses synthesized have been performed. The temperature-concentration dependences of electrical conductivity of the glasses have been studied over a wide temperature range; the glass transition temperatures and the nature of charge carriers have been determined. The IR spectra and Raman spectra have been recorded at room temperature; the density and microhardness of the glasses and ultrasound velocity have been measured. A comparison of the electrical conductivities of the investigated glasses with those of the earlier studied glasses in the Na2O-P2O5 system has shown their fair coincidence. The introduction of sodium sulfide into the Na2O-P 2O5 system is accompanied by an approximately threefold increase in electrical conductivity, although the concentrations of charge carriers (sodium ions) in the glasses amount to ∼17 and ∼26 mmol/cm 3, respectively. The rise in electrical conductivity has been assumed to be caused by the increase in the degree of dissociation of polar structural chemical units including sulfide ions and by the higher mobility of sodium ions in the oxygen-free matrix. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2011.",Glass Physics and Chemistry
Discharge reaction mechanism of room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery with tetra ethylene glycol dimethyl ether liquid electrolyte,"The first discharge curve of a sodium-sulfur cell using a tetra ethylene glycol dimethyl ether liquid electrolyte at room temperature shows two different regions: a sloping region and a plateau region of 1.66 V. The first discharge capacity is 538 mAh g-1 sulfur and then decreases with repeated charge-discharge cycling to give 240 mAh g-1 after ten cycles. Elemental sulfur of the cathode changes to sodium polysulfides Na 2S2 and Na2S3, during full discharge. The sodium polysulfides, however, do not reduce completely to elemental sulfur after full charging. In summary, the mechanism of the battery with liquid electrolyte is 2Na + nS → Na2Sn(4 > n ≥ 2) on discharge and Na2Sn(4 > n ≥ 2) → x(2Na + nS) + (1 - x)Na2Sn(5 > n > 2) on charge. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Journal of Power Sources

During the past decade, extensive efforts have been dedicated to developing advanced batteries with large capacity, high energy and power density, high safety, long cycle life, fast response, and low cost. Here, recent progress in functional materials applied in the currently prevailing rechargeable lithium-ion, nickel-metal hydride, lead acid, vanadium redox flow, and sodium-sulfur batteries is reviewed.

Radical polymer - A new class of high performance electrode materials for rechargeable batteries,"Radical polymers are aliphatic or nonconjugated polymers bearing organic redox radicals as pendant groups on their structural unit. These radical sites populated in large densities allow the electrochemical redox reaction taking place through the polymer layer by redox gradient-driven electron transport and behave as electroactive centers. Since radical polymer can be designed with a large population of redox radicals and electron exchange between the radical sites are usually very fast, they are considered as a new class of charge storage and transport materials with the possibility to provide high electrical storage capacity and high charge-discharge rate capability. Particularly, these polymers are completely organic with the advantage of being fully substainable, they are ideal for the displacement of inorganic materials in diverse applications such as electrochemical supercapacitors, photovoltaic cells and rechargeable batteries. This paper is intended to review the structural characteristics, electrochemical reaction mechanisms and current development status of the radical polymers as electode-active materials, with focus on the technological challenges and ongoing research strategies of these novel electrode materials as used for construction of high capacity and high rate rechargeable batteries.

First principles calculation of thermodynamic properties of NaAlSi ternary,"PbFCl-type NaAlSi ternary is a corrosion compound found in aluminum, which is used as a sealing material in sodium sulfur battery. To understand and control the corrosion process, it is important to predict its quantitative properties. In this study, a first-principles calculation has been carried out to calculate its equilibrium lattice parameters, bulk modulus and pressure derivative of bulk modulus by both all-electron full-potential linear augmented plane wave scheme and pseudopotential plane wave scheme within the generalized gradient approximation. The theoretical results show good agreement with the available experimental data. The thermodynamic properties, including the specific heat capacity and entropy with pressure up to 9 GPa, have been investigated for the first time by coupling of density functional perturbation theory and quasiharmonic approximation. The volume and linear thermal expansion coefficients were estimated and the results show that the linear thermal expansion on c-axis is nearly twice as large as that on a-axis within the calculated temperature. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Calorimetric measurement of the heat generated by a Double-Layer Capacitor cell under cycling,"A calorimetric technique was developed for measuring heat generated within a Double-Layer Capacitor cell under cycling by analyzing its transient temperature change. Measurements were performed for a short time period of the current cycle to get small temperature changes and thus not substantially affect the properties of the cell during charge and discharge. The calorimetric technique is described and its performance demonstrated on a symmetrical activated carbon cell with 1 M N(C2H5)4BF4 in propylene carbonate as electrolyte over a wide current range. Capacitance of the cell at room temperature was around to 0.25 F cm-2. Power density was found between 2 × 10-3 to 70 × 10-3 W cm-2 according to the current density that varied between 0.01 and 0.15 A cm-2 for a cell load pressure equal to 25 kg cm-2. Equivalent resistance, measured on the calorimeter, was found to vary between 4 and 8 Ω cm2, according to the charge rate. Calorimetric measurements were found in good agreement with the energy balance of the cell deduced from the potential profiles and currents. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Enabling renewable energy-and the future grid-with advanced electricity storage,"Environmental concerns about using fossil fuels, and their resource constraints along with energy security concerns, have spurred great interest in generating electrical energy from renewable sources. The variable and stochastic nature of renewable sources, however, makes solar and wind power difficult to manage, especially at high levels of penetration. Electrical energy storage (EES) is necessary to effectively use intermittent renewable energy, enable its delivery, and improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of the electrical grid. While EES has gained wide attention for hybrid and electrical vehicle needs, public awareness and understanding of the critical challenges in energy storage for renewable integration and the future grid is relatively lacking. This paper examines the benefits and challenges of EES, in particular electrochemical storage or battery technologies, and discusses the fundamental principles, economics, and feasibility of the storage technologies. © 2010 TMS.",JOM
Overview: The emf method as a source of experimental thermodynamic data,"The use of galvanic cells to determine the thermodynamic properties of metallic or ceramic materials from electromotive force (emf) measurements is described. Two basic types of the method are distinguished: those employing liquid electrolytes and those based on solid ion-conducting electrolytes. Liquid electrolytes can be aqueous solutions, but for thermodynamic measurements in metallic materials molten salt mixtures with the addition of the corresponding charge-carrying ion are mostly used. Solid electrolytes applied in the thermochemistry of alloys and ceramic materials are usually based on oxides (such as ZrO2) as oxygen conductors, on β- or β″-alumina as sodium ion conductors (with the possibility to exchange sodium ions by other cations), or on fluorides (such as CaF2) as fluoride conductors. For all these cases, typical cell arrangements and corresponding examples from the literature are given. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing ionic conductivity of polymer-sodium salt complex by addition of a non-ionic plastic crystal,"Ionic conductivity and other physico-chemical properties of a soft matter composite electrolyte comprising of a polymer-sodium salt complex and a non-ionic plastic crystal are discussed here. The electrolyte under discussion comprises of polyethyleneoxide (PEO)-sodium triflate (NaCF3SO 3) and succinonitrile (SN). Addition of SN to PEO-NaCF 3SO3 resulted in significant enhancement in ionic conductivity. At 50% SN concentration (with respect to weight of polymer), the polymer-plastic composite electrolyte room temperature (= 25 °C) ionic conductivity was ∼ 1.1 × 10- 4 ω- 1 cm- 1, approximately 45 times higher than PEO-NaCF3SO 3. Observations from ac-impedance spectroscopy along with X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy strongly suggest the enhancement in the composite is ionic conductivity due to enhanced ion mobility via decrease in crystallinity of PEO. The free standing composite polymer-plastic electrolytes were more compliable than PEO-NaCF3SO3 thus exhibiting no detrimental effects of succinonitrile addition on the mechanical stability of PEO-NaCF 3SO3. We propose that the exploratory PEO-NaCF 3SO3-SN system discussed here will eventually be developed as a prototype electrolyte for sodium-sulfur batteries capable of operating at ambient and sub-ambient conditions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Effect of ultrasonic wave irradiation on the electrical conductivity of the undoped and doped molten sulfur with some inorganic materials,"The electrical conductivity and the activation energy of conduction were measured up to 340°C for undoped sulfur melts and doped sulfur melts with 5 mol% LiF, 5 mol% NaF, 13.4 mol% NaCl, 1 and 5 mol% KCl, 5 mol% NaBr, 5 mol% Se, 5 mol% NaBr + 5 mol% Se, 5 mol% Na2SO4, 5 and 10 mol% Na. The effect of irradiation of ultrasonic waves of 20 kHz was studied. The electrical conductivity generally increased with increasing temperature above 200°C with a variety of temperature dependencies. The addition of NaBr, Se, LiF, Na2SO4, NaBr + Se, and KCl caused an increase in conductivity in this order by max. two orders of magnitude. For sulfur melts doped with 5 and 10 mol% Na, a wide jump of electrical conductivity occurred at 245°C, giving exceedingly high electrical conductivities above this temperature. By the irradiation of ultrasonic waves, the electrical conductivity was raised together with the formation of jump for Se, NaBr + Se, 5 mol% Na, LiF, Na2SO4, NaBr, and NaF. The largest irradiation effect was observed for 10 mol% Na, for which the jump temperature was 190°C. The activation energies classified into low, medium, and high groups were obtained. The assumption of microscopic temperature was proposed, which was found to explain the electrical conductivity of irradiated melts.","Phosphorus, Sulfur and Silicon and the Related Elements"
Structural considerations of intermetallic electrodes for lithium batteries,"Although metal alloys and intermetallic compounds have been researched extensively as possible negative electrodes for lithium batteries, only recently have efforts been made to monitor the phase transitions that occur during their reaction with lithium by in situ X-ray diffraction.

Calculations from emf data show that the activity of Na2O in the Na2O-xAl2O3 binary system, decreases with increasing value of x for 5.5<x<8.5 and is constant for 8.5<x<19. Both lattice parameter and emf data are in agreement with the phase diagram proposed by Y. Le Cars and coworkers, which shows only a single phase β-alumina region within the composition range 5.5<x<8.5 and a two-phase β- and α-region from x>8.5. These results suggest that β″-alumina is not a separate phase and provide new edvidence that β″-alumina can be considered as a region of stacking disorder within the β-alumina phase, as reported by D. Gratias and coworkers. Although XRD can identify the presence of both structures, thermodynamic evidence is provided to suggest that the microdomains of β″-alumina and β-alumina structures are part of one single β-alumina phase, formed syntaxially as long-range stacking disorder.",Materials Research Bulletin
Low-temperature zinc-sulfur battery Niedertemperatur-zink-schwefel-batterie,"High-temperature sulfur batteries, for example the sodium-sulfur battery, are well known. However, the positive electrode based on elementary sulfur at room temperature in a metal-sulfur battery could not be constructed because sulfur is known to be an excellent insulator. Due to its low atomic weight, its low cost and its non-toxicity, sulfur would be a desirable material for batteries. We could show that elementary sulfur is an excellent cathode material at room temperature as it is reduced rapidly in aqueous solutions on the surface of iron sulfide electrodes. The open-cell voltage of a zinc-sulfur battery is about 0.6V, that of a lithium-sulfur battery about 2.5V. The capacities and specific energies exceed those of commercially available zinc-manganese dioxide batteries. In this context the electrochemical reaction of solid elementary sulfur on iron sulfide surfaces in sea water is discussed which could have been one of the energy sources which played a role in the development of life.",Monatshefte fur Chemie
Spinel electrodes for lithium batteries,This article gives a historical account of the development of spinel electrodes for rechargeable lithium batteries. Research in the late 1970s and early 1980s on high-temperature Li/Fe3O4 cells led to the evaluation of lithium spinels Li[B2]X4 at room temperature (B = metal cation). This work highlighted the importance of the [B2]X4 spinel framework as a host electrode structure and the ability to tailor the cell voltage by selection of various B cations. Examples of lithium-ion cells that operate with spinel anode/spinel cathode couples are provided. Particular attention is given to spinels within the solid-solution system Li1+xMn2-xO4 (0≤x≤0.33).,Journal of the American Ceramic Society

Raman and X-ray diffraction study of boehmite gels and their transformation to α- or β-alumina,"The structural evolution of gel-derived boehmite and alkali-doped boehmite samples, undergoing different heat treatments up to 1200°C, was followed by both X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering measurements, collected at room temperature. Our observations reveal the presence of different transition alumina phases at intermediate temperatures, before formation at the highest temperatures of stable α-alumina or β + β″-alumina, for alkali-loaded Al2O3. In particular, Raman data from samples treated at 400°C are consistent with a phase change from pseudo-boehmite to the γ-alumina structure, while the dehydroxylation process is not yet completed. The process appears independent of the presence of alkali: identical evolution was presented up to 800°C by all our samples. After final annealing at 1200°C the presence of alkali induces the formation of stable β + β″-alumina phases whereas, in the absence of alkali, a phase identified as Θ-Al2O3 is observed at 1000°C and, finally, stable α-Al2O3 is obtained at 1200°C. © 1990.",Journal of Solid State Chemistry
An Energetic Medium for Electrochemical Storage Utilizing the High Aqueous Solubility of Potassium Polysulfide,"The aqueous solubility of potassium polysulfide is measured to be 8.5m (64% K2S4, 36% H2O by weight) at 25°C, and 11.4m (70% by weight) at 50°C. This novel, energetic medium, containing more total sulfur than water, are investigated as high energy density half-cells for secondary electrochemical storage systems, according to K2S4 + 6e- + 6K+ ⇄ 4K2S The storage half-cell, contained by a sulfonated styrene and Teflon membrane, is demonstrated to be capable of being cycled at room temperature, with a storage capacity of up to 1.8x106 C/kg, operating at currents of over 1A through a 10 cm2 thin film CoS electrode with overpotential losses of less than 2 mV/cm2/mA. © 1987, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

Direct synthesis and characterization of the Fe3+ analogue of Na β″-alumina,"A new isomorphic analogue of β″-alumina, a potassium-free Na-ferrite (Na2O · ∼5 (Al0.10Fe1.90)O3, referred to as Na β″-ferrite), has been synthesized and is characterized using X-ray powder and single crystal diffraction, wet chemical analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, Na β″-aluminate-gallate-ferrate phases were also successfully synthesized, but were not characterized in detail. Na β″-ferrite grew in a slowly cooling melt or partial melt from 1250° C in air using Na2CO3 and Fe3O4 (magnetite) as starting materials. The compound was also synthesized using α-Fe2O3 instead of Fe3O4 under the same conditions, but its abundance was much less and α-Fe2O3 and NaFeO2 were the dominant phases. The new material (cell dimensions a = 0.5955, c = 3.5623 nm) is reversibly hygroscopic, and c increases 2% after hydration. TEM images dearly show the 1.19 nm lattice spacing corresponding to the ionic conduction planes, and these planes are observed to be both straight and curled. The origin of the curled lattice planes, the existence of which is also evident in the single crystal precession photographs, is not clear, although we believe it may involve a structural misfit between the ferric oxide spineI block and soda layer. © 1986 Chapman and Hall Ltd.",Journal of Materials Science
Electrochemical and Spectroscopic Studies of Sulfur in Aluminum Chloride-N-(n-Butyl)Pyridinium Chloride,"The behavior of sulfur in aluminum chloride-N-(n-butyl)pyridinium chloride (A1C13-BPC) was studied using Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques. In basic (BPC-rich) melts, sulfur can be reduced to sulfide, probably in the form of an AISCI-like species. No oxidation to positive oxidation states of sulfur is observed in basic melts. In acidic (AlCl3-rich) melts, sulfur can be oxidized to S(I) and eventually to S(IV), which is only stable in the melt for short periods of time. No reduction to sulfide-like species or formation of low oxidation states is observed in acidic melts. © 1985, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

Electro-mechanical degradation of polycrystalline beta-alumina,"Deposition of metallic sodium under conditions of current flow of sodium ions through beta-alumina ceramics is an important cause of their breakdown when the solid electrolyte is used as a separator in various electrochemical devices. Cells of different combinations: Na/Beta-Alumina/Na amalgam, Na/Beta-Alumina/Cu(probe), and Na/Beta-Alumina/Na, etc have been investigated for sodium deposition at room temperature and at 350°C. A method is presented by which the progress of sodium deposition may be followed. A mechanism of formation of sodium deposition centers at impurity rich spots and other defect sites has been proposed. © 1981.",Ceramics International
Some geometrical aspects of breakdown of sodium beta alumina,The breakdown of single and polycrystalline sodium beta alumina was studied at 300°C and at room temperature. The breakdown in polycrystals involves a propagation of a highly-branched sodium-filled crack network. In single crystals the fracture surface could be studied directly. It was found that the crack network is filled with sodium from the crack faces rather than the crack tip. © 1979.,Materials Research Bulletin

Identification of solid oxygen-containing Na-electrolytes: An assessment based on crystallographic and economic parameters,"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimWe have scanned the inorganic crystal structure database using Voronoi-Dirichlet methodology for inorganic, crystalline, solid Na electrolytes and applied a total of nine different crystallographic and economic parameters in order to evaluate the potential of each material. Especially for stationary electrochemical energy storage — used to counteract the capricious nature of renewable energy sources and momentary variations of energy consumption — Na-based chemistries have a considerable market share. They rely on solid Na electrolytes separating the Na and S electrode compartments. We used data generated from the currently widest-spread Na electrolytes to lay a foundation for the crystallographic data mining and Voronoi-Dirichlet partitioning of the database. The structural data is the basis for the calculation of the above-mentioned parameters. We introduced an evaluation and scoring scheme to systematise the results and — depending on the weighting scheme — point towards the most promising materials. Aluminosilicates and transition metal oxides seem especially interesting but, depending on the weighting, any of the more than 400 candidates could be the next-generation solid Na electrolyte.",Crystal Research and Technology
"Effect of ZnO filler concentration on the conductivity, structure and morphology of PVdF-HFP nanocomposite solid polymer electrolyte for lithium battery application","The polyvinylidene difluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVdF-HFP) nanocomposite solid polymer electrolyte films were developed by solution-casting method. PVdF-HFP as a polymer host, lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) as a salt for lithium ion, and ZnO nanoparticles as fillers were used to form the nanocomposite solid polymer electrolyte films. All the prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron microscopy. The XRD patterns of the pure and nanocomposite solid polymer electrolyte samples indicate the formation of amorphous phase with 17.5 wt.% of lithium salt and ZnO fillers up to 3 wt.%. The total conductivity and lithium ion transference number were studied at room temperature by using impedance spectroscopy and Wagner's polarization methods. The highest conductivity at room temperature for solid polymer electrolyte and nanocomposite solid polymer electrolyte are found to be 3.208 × 10-4 and 1.043 × 10-3 S/cm, respectively. Similarly, the lithium ion transference number is evaluated for the optimized solid polymer electrolyte and nanocomposite solid polymer electrolyte films with 3 wt.% of ZnO fillers. And it is found that ionic transference number could be enhanced from 92 to 95 % with the addition of nanosized ZnO fillers to the solid polymer electrolyte. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Ionics
